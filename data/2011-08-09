 CIA-87	shogun: Justin Patera master * r382c407 / (5 files): changed 'print' to 'puts' for more idiomatic & nicer-looking ruby - http://bit.ly/roV0QA
 CIA-87	shogun: Justin Patera master * re81612c / (146 files):
 CIA-87	shogun: used an automated program to translate shogun examples in python to ruby.
 CIA-87	shogun: most of them work, but may need to be cleaned up & prettified.
 CIA-87	shogun: that is stage 2... - http://bit.ly/ovuTcJ
 CIA-87	shogun: Justin Patera master * rfca3318 / (141 files):
 CIA-87	shogun: last commit didn't work too well. most of the examples fail, but that is to be expected.
 CIA-87	shogun: need to fix & get the examples running right... fun! - http://bit.ly/r4fDAi

@sonney2k	heiko, why not insert everything into the array and then sort it *once* afterwards?
 heiko	sonney2k, hi
@sonney2k	heiko, I mean we only need to register transitions once
@bettyboo	!
 heiko	this would be possible
@sonney2k	I mean per class one registers all transitions and then calls finalize_transitions() or so
 heiko	but then it is even less a map
 heiko	but ok
 heiko	it is called ParameterMap anyways
 heiko	so this would be ok
 heiko	will add a flag if finalize() was called
 heiko	and throw error if not
@sonney2k	finalize_mapping()
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	don't make it overly compilicated ... this should be totally sufficient
 heiko	yes true :)
@bettyboo	haha
@sonney2k	heiko, regarding the constructor calls - yes you are right the *default* constuctor of the inherited class is called - but please make it explicit
@sonney2k	heiko, regarding the warning - we have to disable this at some point - but ok lets keep it for now
 heiko	sonney2k, the warnings will automatically be gone if a file contains a parameter version
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rf0ded6a / (7 files in 3 dirs):
 CIA-87	shogun: Merge pull request #273 from frx/streaming_vw
 CIA-87	shogun: Added VW hash functions. - http://bit.ly/plpCSG
@sonney2k	heiko, I know but currently every saved file will trigger such warnings...
 heiko	sonney2k, should this explicit base constructor call be there everytime? I have not done it in all my classes
@sonney2k	I mean there is only shogun 0.10.x with taht version
 heiko	sonney2k, but there will be two warnings anyways per file
@sonney2k	heiko, yes please
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah that warning should of course go too
 heiko	I mean it would be better to remove these
 heiko	ok, then a method like check_parameter_existance should be there
@sonney2k	or quietly attempt to load...

 blackburn	sonney2k: got a trouble with java serialization
 blackburn	everything is clear but there are classes *not* derived from SGObject
 blackburn	and they don't have any save_serializable
 blackburn	one solution is to call method using reflection, but it is not pretty enough for me
 blackburn	may be we should ignore this objects in java_modular if possible?

@sonney2k	serialhex, around?
@sonney2k	f-x, could you please fix the minor issues such that I can merge your patch?
 f-x	sonney2k: done
@sonney2k	great
@sonney2k	f-x, there is another float in Math.h in 311
 f-x	ah damn
 f-x	sonney2k: submitted.. i'll send the other learner also now
@sonney2k	ok thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, any class not derived from SGObject should be %ignored - I hope that doesn't create further clashes then...
 serialhex	sonney2k: i'm around now, what's up??
 serialhex	p.s. e-mailing me is a much better way to contact me, as i can check e-mail at work, i can't irc at work :P
