 blackburn	wiking: what can we do with your oppan gangnam style solver?
 wiking	:>
 wiking	solveit :)
 blackburn	heeey sexy solver
 blackburn	oop oop
 blackburn	oppan
 wiking	:P
 wiking	blackburn: new job?
 blackburn	wiking: yes
 wiking	blackburn: where to?
 wiking	and congratz
 blackburn	http://smartsolutions-123.ru/en/
 blackburn	thanks
 wiking	is this the java company?
 blackburn	wiking: yeah they do java and C#
 blackburn	wiking: well they fucking write code
 blackburn	not fixing legacy bugs
 blackburn	here I fix legacy bugs
 blackburn	I've been fscking fixing bugs for an year
 wiking	:>>
 blackburn	I just want to http://stfuawsc.com/
 wiking	ahhaha
 wiking	ohman
 wiking	this ascii serialization format is not the nicest parsable format
 blackburn	wiking: ah btw could you please take a look at https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee when you have time
 wiking	ah yeah a friend asked
 blackburn	may be you could have some thoughts what is wrong
 wiking	do you know a very efficient method to diagonilze small matrices
 wiking	but a lot of it
 blackburn	dense?
 wiking	small matrix
 wiking	6x6
 wiking	so yeah dense matrix
 wiking	ok what could be wrong with this?
 wiking	i mean it's just like design wise i should look
 wiking	or what exactly you would like to talk about?
 blackburn	wiking: yes, design wise
 blackburn	sure I don't ask you to find a lowlevel mistake somewhere :)
 wiking	:>
 wiking	ok i'll check it
 blackburn	okay actually what I know about diagonalization
 blackburn	eigen has bad and mkl has good
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	why we cannot have a serializer like
 wiking	numpy has
 wiking	savetxt
 blackburn	wiking: what's the difference?
 wiking	well the format? :D
 wiking	have u seen the output of SerializableAsciiFile
 wiking	?
 wiking	:>
 sonne|work	wiking: we have simple load / save routines
 sonne|work	serializable* stuff works for much more complex data
 sonne|work	like saving whole svm incl. kernel & features etc
 wiking	sonne|work: for sgvector?
 sonne|work	wiking: for *features
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	but yes this should be moved into sgvector and friends
 wiking	i just want to save a simple sgvector
 sonne|work	but we didn't have that at the time
 sonne|work	basically features were what SGVector etc were before
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'm chechking the code
 sonne|work	wiking: btw I asked again
 sonne|work	(not sure if you have seen)
 sonne|work	answer 'tonight'
 sonne|work	but that was yesterday
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah i've seen it
 sonne|work	no idea
 wiking	i've even answered
 sonne|work	heh I went to bed
 wiking	so yeah i know that around 1pm CET
 wiking	or somewhere there we should get some mail
 sonne|work	or not
 sonne|work	whatever strange handling
 wiking	:>
 wiking	sonne|work: why do you set/reset locale?
 sonne|work	0,1 <-> 0.1
 sonne|work	in germany it is 0,1
 sonne|work	in us 0.1`
 sonne|work	so better use C always
 wiking	ah got it
 wiking	lol
 wiking	../shogun/io/File.h:33:22: error: expected class name
 wiking	class CFile : public CSGObject
 wiking	wtf
 wiking	ok this is fucking hilarious
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/963ts5Rv
 wiking	hahah i cannot include File.h in SGVector
 wiking	it's like a snake biting his own tail
 wiking	somewhere we need a class CSGObject; ;)
 wiking	but it's hilarious
 wiking	whatever i start in the last 3 days nothing works
 wiking	so i think i shouldnt do anything
 sonne|work	ahhh
 sonne|work	that all needs to be in a .cpp file
 sonne|work	then you can use forward declarations
 sonne|work	I hate this dependency hell in C++
 wiking	what all needs to be in a cpp file
 wiking	i mean yes sure but in order to be able to declare the load/save function for SGVEctor i have to include the header
 wiking	and now it's extremely fucked up
 wiking	because no matter where i put the class CSGObject; declaration
 wiking	i mean in which header
 wiking	the includes are first
 wiking	so i have to put it before any include
 wiking	ok solved it
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] vigsterkr opened pull request #825: Add load/save functionality for SGVector (master...latent)  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/825
 wiking	so here it goes... a bit of a fixing as well of precisions...
 wiking	oh sorry some shit got left in sgvector...
 sonne|work	what is the +GET_VECTOR(get_vector, get_int8_matrix, int8_t)
 sonne|work	68 69
 sonne|work	 GET_VECTOR(get_vector, get_matrix, uint8_t) ?
 wiking	?
 wiking	line 68/69 was there
 wiking	i've just added GET_VECTOR(get_vector, get_int8_matrix, int8_t)
 wiking	to support int8_t
 sonne|work	ahh I see. another transition needed :/
 sonne|work	we decided to use overloading this GSoC
 wiking	?
 blackburn	what?
 sonne|work	what??
 wiking	whaaaat?
 blackburn	WAT
 blackburn	sonne|work: in germany you also have comma instead of point?
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	I thought it is used only in ussr :)
 sonne|work	you have it too :)(
 blackburn	I don't like that pretty much
 blackburn	and I don't like cyrillic letters actually

 wiking	blackburn: yey
 wiking	although i haven't been looking for it
 wiking	but i found a solution for solving nonconvex function with bundiling methods :)
 wiking	yo anybody
 wiking	(Fenchel Dual) is only true for convex functions?
 wiking	well i'll assume this :DD
 wiking	and let's see where it takes me
 blackburn	wiking: hey
 blackburn	non-convex?
 wiking	aayep
 wiking	i'm just checking if i can apply the dual form
 wiking	as for that we have libqp as a solver
 wiking	or do we have a primal solver for min_w \lambda/2 ||w||^2+max_{j=1..t}{c_j(w)}
 wiking	i guess this is a no
 wiking	 :)
 blackburn	re
 blackburn	wiking: wat ist da c_j?
 wiking	c_j(w) = <a_j, w> + b_j
 wiking	it's a cutting plane basically
 blackburn	wiking: can't libqp solve this?
 wiking	well the dual form of it yes
 wiking	i'm just not sure that the dual that i get with Fenchel Dual theorem stands if that function is non-convex
 blackburn	I feel stupid
 wiking	yeah me too
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	but i'm just bruteforcing it
 wiking	blackburn: what's gonna happen with that 2 PR? :)
 blackburn	wiking: no idea I didn't take a look
 blackburn	did soeren?
 blackburn	wiking: why to load sgvector from file?
 wiking	blackburn: why not
 wiking	i needed now
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	how do you use it though?

 wiking	blackburn: here?
 blackburn	yeh
 wiking	blackburn: why we only have gmnp_imdm ?
 blackburn	malozemov demyanov mitchell?
 wiking	Improved Mitchell-Demyanov-Malozemov
 blackburn	just random guess - it is the best
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	okay actually I asked myself why
 blackburn	but I didn't ask vojtech
 blackburn	may be he was lazy
 blackburn	may be it is the best approach
 wiking	because he has other ones as well
 wiking	in his other
 wiking	lib
 wiking	    mdm  ... Mitchell-Demyanov-Malozemov
 wiking	%    imdm  ... Improved Mitchell-Demyanov-Malozemov (default).
 wiking	%    iimdm  ... Improved (version 2) Mitchell-Demyanov-Malozemov.
 wiking	%    kozinec ... Kozinec algorithm.
 wiking	%    keerthi ... Derived from NPA algorithm by Keerthi et al.
 wiking	%    kowalczyk ... Based on Kowalczyk's maximal margin perceptron.
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	what do you expect from say kozinec?
 blackburn	I mean they are all nearly the same I believe
 wiking	oh nothing
 wiking	i was just wondering why
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	I just mean
 blackburn	not really sure we can speed it up
 blackburn	or anything
 blackburn	but yes would be nice to have all of them
 blackburn	I wanted to implement that even
 blackburn	copy and paste code I mean
 wiking	it's just porting basicaly
 wiking	at first step
 blackburn	I am afraid it is vojtech's phd related
 blackburn	if you know what I mean
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	it looks more powerful when you have 6 methods
 blackburn	and his phd is all about multiclass
 wiking	:>
 wiking	ok so now the last question
 wiking	which is better to use
 wiking	gnmp or libqp?
 wiking	as i can see
 wiking	gnmplib solves almost the same (actually exactly what i need)
 wiking	libqp is more general
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	no i dont get it
 blackburn	yeah libqp is more general
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	do you think gmnplib solves the same problem?
 wiking	well not the same problem
 wiking	but the non-convex thing
 blackburn	is MC problem non-convex?
 wiking	well
 wiking	i have this problem
 wiking	1/2 ||w||^2 + R(w)
 wiking	usual bundle problem
 wiking	and the dual form of this
 wiking	is actually exactly what gnmplib solves
 blackburn	hmm I see
 blackburn	then use it :)
 wiking	u mean gnmplib?
 blackburn	but I didn't like gmnp when I use it
 wiking	i wonder why uricamic used libqp and not gnmplib
 blackburn	converges for hours
 wiking	i guess vojtec had a good reason for telling him to use libqp instead of gnmp
 wiking	;P
 wiking	or? :)
 blackburn	yeah he probably knows better
 blackburn	the prob is 1.0
 wiking	well actually i'll write both
 wiking	and one will be able to choose which QP solver to use
 blackburn	what are you developing?
 wiking	and we can even compare
 blackburn	is that latent?
 wiking	this nonconvex bundle method
 wiking	well
 blackburn	oppan gangnam style?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	latent model's formulation is usually nonconvex
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	for solving this
 wiking	usually one uses somekind of an approx
 wiking	like CCCP
 blackburn	haha
 wiking	but this solver would fucking solve it in your face :)
 wiking	without approxx
 wiking	:>>
 wiking	gangnam style shit bro
 blackburn	how can they name method like that
 blackburn	CCCP
 blackburn	damn
 wiking	blackburn: well yeah
 blackburn	I have seen that before
 blackburn	but always laugh
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	me too
 wiking	but that's how it is
 blackburn	I will call my next method ?????
 blackburn	or ??????
 wiking	stalin is cool
 wiking	;)
 wiking	ctalnh
 wiking	almost fonetic of the cyrilic
 wiking	so that u dont have to use utf8
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	CTALNH
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	lol
 wiking	yeah indeed
 wiking	mmm shitfuck
 wiking	i think i had an enlightment moment now :)
 blackburn	hallelujah
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	huh
 wiking	where the fuck was this paper i was looking for now
 wiking	:))))
 blackburn	in journal
 blackburn	hope that helps!
 blackburn	:D
