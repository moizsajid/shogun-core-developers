 hushell	actually, what I have modified will not affect any application, unless you want to get unnormalized primal objectives, even risks recorded in BmrmStatistics are unchanged

 lisitsyn	right?
 lisitsyn	I think I f* up time again
 sonne|work	why not sleep is overrated
 lisitsyn	okay I can do that too indeed
 lisitsyn	wiking: doodle please ;)
 wiking	lisitsyn: new doodle? i've filled out one but that meeting has not happened
 wiking	lisitsyn: have u created one? if not then i'll create one now

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix memleak in CSVFile_unittest.cc
 gsomix|lab	wiking: thanks!
 sonne|work	wiking: something is weird
 sonne|work	wiking: the LMNN notebook finished in 3 minutes now
 sonne|work	but the whole thing died nevertheless
 sonne|work	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/557/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
 sonne|work	wiking: did perhaps the shell script hang at the end?
 wiking	sonne|work: noidea
 wiking	sonne|work: fixing memleaks
 sonne|work	wiking: please have a look / add some debug echo 's - nightly_default takes a year to complete and it is blocking me to get this stuff integrated on the website
 wiking	sonne|work: blocking?
 wiking	sonne|work: i mean you can create a script that does ls *html in current
 wiking	and then just link it to the html file
 sonne|work	wiking: haha
 wiking	as for sure that this is going to change in the future
 wiking	or?
 sonne|work	we are talking python & django
 wiking	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	no static page
 wiking	os.walk(directory)
 wiking	no need for static page
 wiking	just a page that is dynamically generated from the found html files in a given directory
 sonne|work	I can only start working on this once the thing runs through
 wiking	eh?
 wiking	it's really that what we need
 sonne|work	I don't have shell access from here so I cannot debug the bash script
 wiking	but what does this have to do with a dynamically generated page
 wiking	sorry i dont see the connection
 sonne|work	wiking: I can only do one thing at a time
 wiking	you know that there's going to be n html files
 wiking	in a directory
 sonne|work	and before notebooks don't run through I have no time for the rest
 wiking	we need a listing of it and do a <a href="the notebook.html">this file</a> to it

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: this unit test is still leaking...
 wiking	whats my username for django
 wiking	or how can i reset the passwd?
 sonne|work	I don't know yours
 wiking	and this site needs a restructure
 wiking	why downloads is under documentation?
 wiking	this does not  make any sense
 wiking	usersnames are emails or simple username?

 lisitsyn	as well as sonne|work
 lisitsyn	not me though :D
 pickle27	haha, they're tall guys eh
 lisitsyn	pickle27: so you must enjoy your trip, do you? ;)
 pickle27	lisitsyn, yeah its been quite fun, Japan is a cool and strange place
 pickle27	kind of looking forward to NZ though, I don't speak any Japanese so it will be nice to be back somewhere where I can communicate properly
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh don't they know english?
 pickle27	lisitsyn, I've been surprised at how little they know
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I thought they do a bit
 pickle27	I'll be sure to learn some japanese if I ever come back!
 lisitsyn	ha it's gonna be tough
 pickle27	lisitsyn, most people probably think I'm wierd but I've been enjoying doing some casual coding on the trains etc lol
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh why it is cool
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I enjoy coding stuff just for fun
 lisitsyn	when doing it as job it is not that funny :(
 pickle27	lisitsyn, I guess we're all like that and thats why we're here
 pickle27	lisitsyn, you must be back at the university now yes?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: no why?
 pickle27	oh just curious, when do you go back?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I just have to finish a few courses
 lisitsyn	and write some shitty thesis
 lisitsyn	:D
 pickle27	haha
 pickle27	lisitsyn, could you do your thesis on tapkee?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah why not
 lisitsyn	they don't give a sh* what is it going around
 lisitsyn	and hey I have *publication* lol
 pickle27	yeah no one really cares about masters thesis here either
 lisitsyn	pickle27: btw I ended up with using MOG2
 lisitsyn	:D
 pickle27	lisitsyn, oh right on, I'm glad you got it working
 lisitsyn	pickle27: adaptive median is similar though
 lisitsyn	pickle27: one thing that surprised me was
 lisitsyn	I just tried liblinear+hog
 lisitsyn	and then tried to beat it with haar cascade
 lisitsyn	and hog cascade
 lisitsyn	infinite time training and too many false positives :(
 lisitsyn	apparently svm just works
 pickle27	haar and hog is supposed to be good but the opencv forums are completely filled with people having issues using them
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I barely have any idea what to use instead :)
 lisitsyn	ah do you mean that cascade?
 lisitsyn	if yes - yeah it seems to be a miracle to properly train it
 lisitsyn	as it takes a lot of time I have no idea how to do that

 besser82	HeikoS, sonne|work, wiking:  cloud-appliance will be avail in short  ;)
@HeikoS	whooooo :D
 besser82	HeikoS, sonne|work, wiking:  any special needs?
@HeikoS	besser82: awesome!
 besser82	HeikoS, sonne|work, wiking:  How many ram, HDD, CPU will be needed?
 besser82	HeikoS, sonne|work, wiking:  IPv4-Adresses, IPv6-subnet  ---> How much / size?
@HeikoS	besser82: good question, best ask wiking
@HeikoS	I would say like a laptop thing
@HeikoS	with less hdd
@HeikoS	but wiking knows better
 besser82	HeikoS: i7-4700, 32GB RAM, GTX685M SLI  ????
 besser82	HeikoS: ^^^ laptop thing  :D
@HeikoS	lol ;)
@HeikoS	Dont know whether we in fact need a gtx
@HeikoS	but the i7 and the ram sounds very nice
 besser82	HeikoS: let's keep it honest ;)
@HeikoS	then we could actually *do* stuff on there
 besser82	HeikoS: I just wrote the specs of my laptop  ;)
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	mine is older
@HeikoS	i5 8gb
 besser82	HeikoS: So sth. in that range?
@HeikoS	I would say, but pls ask the others
 besser82	HeikoS: already did in my first questions...
@HeikoS	yeah, sry I mean wait for them to answer
@HeikoS	really cool that you did that
@sonney2k	besser82, cool!
@sonney2k	besser82, how is that scaled?
@sonney2k	besser82, one machine or multiple?
 besser82	sonney2k: scaled over multiple machines as needed
 besser82	sonney2k: using oVirt
 besser82	sonney2k: I just need some resources-specs and we can have it.
@sonney2k	besser82, and how many machines is realistic
@sonney2k	besser82, between 8 and 16GB make sense
@sonney2k	but it all only depends on application as usual
@sonney2k	and cpu - you know that
 besser82	sonney2k: 8G (16G dyn) shouldn't be the problem
 besser82	sonney2k: CPU the more, the better  ;)
@sonney2k	the more the better
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	some stuff only needs one core
@sonney2k	some multiple
@sonney2k	so no idea how it is done
 besser82	sonney2k: I think, I can arrange dynamic multi core
@sonney2k	which would mean single core and if multiple cores are used then it would get > 1 core?
 besser82	sonney2k: like 8 cores ---> 1 - 2 decidated, rest shared amoung other f-i stuff
 besser82	sonney2k: or sth. like that
@sonney2k	besser82, if shogun sees 8 cores it will use 8 for some tasks
 besser82	sonney2k: that's not the problem
@sonney2k	but spiltting is not dynamic in the sense that it will split the task into 8 chunks
@sonney2k	I guess that should be ok then
 besser82	sonney2k: allright
 besser82	sonney2k: HDD? How much?
 besser82	sonney2k: ~50G
@sonney2k	besser82, regarding all this can we start slow / tiny and grow if needed?
 besser82	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	50G should do
 besser82	sonney2k: growing isn't the probelm  ;)
@sonney2k	it doesn't make sense to waste resources
 besser82	sonney2k: 1x IPv4
@sonney2k	and we don't know what to expect
@sonney2k	yes
 besser82	sonney2k: 1x IPv6 / 64
 besser82	sonney2k: Heise DDOS is in prep  ;)
@sonney2k	sorry I have to do some real life cleanups now
@sonney2k	will be back in ~30mins
@sonney2k	(latest I hope)
 besser82	sonney2k: kk  ;)
 besser82	HeikoS, wiking: Which OS, btw. ?
 besser82	HeikoS, wiking: FC or RHEL?

 wiking	yo
 wiking	what?
 wiking	havent been here tll now
 wiking	besser82: ?
 wiking	ok i'll read logs
 besser82	wiking: here  :)
 besser82	wiking: back in 5 mins  ;)
 wiking	ok
 wiking	besser82: ok so basically at the moment of course anything would be fine, but having at least around 4 gigs dedicated ram would be good
 wiking	besser82: the thing is that it should be possible some way to extend it
 wiking	hence some kind of a 'cluster/cloud' setup
 wiking	number of cpus: 4-8 cores
 wiking	1 ipv4 is more than enough
 wiking	if we get ipv6 /64 subnet that's good as well
 wiking	sonney2k: like 8 cores ---> 1 - 2 decidated, rest shared amoung other f-i stuff
 wiking	this is cool
 wiking	hdd is not that much of a big priority
 wiking	10+ gigs is cool
 wiking	basicaly as i said in the beginning anything is good
 wiking	just to be able to grow w/o too much of a hassle would be great
 wiking	besser82: what would be the arch of this thing?
 wiking	some kind of a virtual OS?
 wiking	i mean basically how could we extend the system easily if we see that we are running out of resource, e.g. ram or cpu?
 wiking	sonney2k: 2 things when u r back: 1) plz give me write access to the shogun-web repository 2) if i could get access to update the webserver on 7nn it would be great!
 wiking	besser82: fc, rhel doesn't matter...
 wiking	whichever is the easier
 besser82	wiking: can get both with ease  ;)
 besser82	wiking: I'd tend to FC19  (much more up2date)
 wiking	besser82: ok then... let me know how and when we can proceed with this
 besser82	wiking: sure, should be a matter of some hours  ;)
 wiking	besser82: could u tell me how the arch would look like?
 wiking	this would be an FC19 in a chroor?
 wiking	chroot?
 wiking	or what exactly? :)
 besser82	wiking: own VM with ~8GM ram, 1decidated core and lots of shared ones, 50 GB persistent HDD ;)
 wiking	ok that sounds great
 wiking	besser82: i'm only concerned about the system's security
 besser82	wiking: scalable on need  ;)
 besser82	wiking: why?
 wiking	as really giving an ipython shell to anybody
 wiking	is a big whole
 besser82	wiking: It's on redhat's systems
 wiking	security wise
 wiking	hence on our machine
 wiking	i thought to have the VM's root mounted r/o
 wiking	and only a small tempfs would be writable
 wiking	but then again i'm open to any ideas
 wiking	just that having an ipython shell is almost like giving somebody a shell access to a system
 besser82	wiking: nope, not on this one  ;)
 besser82	wiking: It pretty locked down by SElinux ;)
 besser82	wiking: With MLS-rules
 wiking	ok i'm happy if i dont have to worry about any of these things :)
 wiking	bt
 besser82	wiking: bt???
 besser82	wiking: big thanks?
 wiking	almost but yes
 wiking	as well
 wiking	:P
 wiking	besser82: (i'm debugging an error in gdb in another session :P)
 besser82	wiking: I see. kk  :)
 besser82	wiking: do we need any ports aside of http(s) / ssh ?
 wiking	noup
 besser82	wiking: kk
 wiking	besser82: can we get a proper signed ssl cert ? :)
 wiking	besser82: if not then just http

 wiking	what's that?
 besser82	wiking: like tmpfs
 wiking	aaah
 wiking	not necessary
 besser82	wiking: but larger and on disk ;)
 besser82	wiking: will be discard on rebott

@sonney2k	hey van51!
 van51	sonney2k: hello!
@sonney2k	did you manage to get the experiment to run now memory wise?
 van51	sonney2k: I can run it with the kernel up to 40k examples I think
 van51	sonney2k: but I evaluate on 100k by doing it on batches
@sonney2k	van51, heh nice workaround
 van51	sonney2k: btw the experiments on the notebook where prior to the quadratic features addition
 van51	sonney2k: now it's a bit slower so I changed some stuff to regain some speed
@sonney2k	van51, well you dont' need to do that with quadratic right?
 van51	sonney2k: no I don't use quadratic features. But in order to unify the code w/ and w/o quadratic a function that generates the token combinations is called always
 van51	sonney2k: and in the non-quadratic case it returns the unigrams
@sonney2k	van51, ahh ok - indeed that should be sped up. I mean using quadratic features will be the rare case
 van51	sonney2k: yeah now I have it almost up to the same speed that it had
 van51	sonney2k: I will have a PR by morning
 van51	sonney2k: with speed comparisons
@sonney2k	van51, nice!
