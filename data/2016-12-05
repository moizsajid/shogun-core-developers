 zero1hac	Hey all, I am a student of Mathematics and Computing from IIT BHU Varanasi. I have some prior experience with Machine learning, Deep learning and Computer Vision algorithms. I have worked upon these algorithms in Python till yet. Now, I want to contribute to shogun ML toolbox. Can somebody guide me where to start ? Or some reading material about current development in shogun ML?
 CaBa	zero1hac: hi :)
 CaBa	zero1hac: i guess you  might want to check this out https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Getting-involved
