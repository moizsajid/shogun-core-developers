zero1hac	Hey all, I am a student of Mathematics and Computing from IIT BHU Varanasi. I have some prior experience with Machine learning, Deep learning and Computer Vision algorithms. I have worked upon these algorithms in Python till yet. Now, I want to contribute to shogun ML toolbox. Can somebody guide me where to start ? Or some reading material about current development in shogun ML?	17:05
