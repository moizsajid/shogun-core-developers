 sonne|work	blackburn: ok again
 sonne|work	blackburn, n4nd0 look we've got some press coverage  http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Shogun-2.1.0-bringt-hunderte-Verbesserungen
 n4nd0	sonne|work: awesome
 blackburn	sonne|work: heh cool
 n4nd0	sonne|work: you are famous
 sonne|work	now if we had fancy applications on the website (d3js ...) then these would be on...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: blackburn and I are getting something with d3js in tapkee
 n4nd0	we could put it to in shogun if you like it
 sonne|work	btw they also announced our workshop... http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Machine-Learning-Workshop-in-Berlin
 blackburn	sonne|work: n4nd0 is going to be a d3 expert soon as he prepares d3.js demo for tapkee :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: preparing DR idea description
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	I didn't get anything from Christoph yet :S
 blackburn	who is Christoph?
 n4nd0	I will write him again soon telling him about what I think it could be done in a project and ask him if he would be interested
 n4nd0	blackburn: Christoph Lampert
 sonne|work	n4nd0: please do it today
 sonne|work	time is running...
 n4nd0	I contacted him and asked him if he would like to mentor a project in Structured Learning
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: ah I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: he has done nice things in computer vision with structured learning
 sonne|work	n4nd0: maybe it helps if you CC me...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: good idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: with CRFs and PGMs in general
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://www.adlibris.com/se/product.aspx?isbn=1601984561
 n4nd0	this is a very nice tutorial
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw I am extremely happy that we managed to get a new release out before gsoc :)
 sonne|work	this and that change in development model / tests should make the whole process go much smoother
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes that's cool
 sonne|work	blackburn: I've had a phone chat with alex yesterday
 sonne|work	he is working out the 2 days post the shogun workshop
 sonne|work	it is likely to work out well.. so we can probably announce things end of the week
 blackburn	sonne|work: alright, cool!
 n4nd0	SWIG question
 n4nd0	I am making an instance of RealMatrixFeatures in python
 n4nd0	and giving it to a StructuredModel
 n4nd0	the member of the StructuredModel is of class Features, parent of RealMatrixFeatures
 n4nd0	I am trying to call get_features_vector() but it doesn't find it in Features - it doesn't exist there
 n4nd0	but it does exist in RealMatrixFeatures
 n4nd0	I am guessing that it either requires some SWIG code or an obtain_from_generic method to cast in python Features to RealMatrixFeatures
 blackburn	sonne|work: I shared a doc with ideas - please send my idea around when you have time
 sonne|work	n4nd0: exactly
 sonne|work	blackburn: just do this directly on the website...
 blackburn	sonne|work: lets keep that in doc yet and publish in a batch mode
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what is prefereable, obtain_from_generic or swig code?
 blackburn	the thing that worries me is that I'd like to get my idea done by myself LOL
 n4nd0	blackburn: with the info that Georg wrote we can probably write in there the description
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes I'll put it in
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha :) it is a nice description
 sonne|work	blackburn: that should not worry you - to the contrary. that will help massively - you might even join the student in coding stuff...
 blackburn	sonne|work: prerequisites: C++, metagenomics
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonne|work: alright 2 ideas ready
 sonne|work	blackburn: put them live and then we can send around another call!
 blackburn	sonne|work: can I put some CI stuff for tapkee on one of our buildbots?
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw I learned how to use gcov so will put it for shogun soon too
 blackburn	sonne|work: tapkee offers me a possibility to play as it compiles just in a few minutes, not hour :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: what is wrong with travis for tapkee then?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can't put anything out of travis
 sonne|work	what not? only issue why we don't put everything on travis is that shogun's stuff takes too long
 blackburn	sonne|work: how can I push generated lcov output somewhere?
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I generate stuff (valgrind output, etc), how can I get it back from travis?
 sonne|work	no idea but how would you get it back from shogun's bb's?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can store some pass there may be
 blackburn	okay I'll try to do that with travis then
 sonne|work	blackburn: you mean ssh key and we rsync stuff? or put it in some folder that can be seen from the web?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah may be ssh
 blackburn	sonne|work: other way could be to update gh_pages folder
 sonne|work	gh_pages?
 blackburn	sonne|work: webpage on github
 blackburn	sonne|work: we could have shogun-toolbox.github.com/shogun-toolbox page if we had gh_pages branch
 blackburn	or shogun-toolbox.github.com
 blackburn	sonne|work: just like that http://lisitsyn.github.com/tapkee
 blackburn	django editor drives me mad
 blackburn	fscking wysiwyg
 sonne|work	blackburn: it is not django editor
 blackburn	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013 sonne|work I put them live
 sonne|work	it is tinymce
 sonne|work	bern4rd added it for convenience
 blackburn	sonne|work: I see
 blackburn	sonne|work: anyway it works like windows
 blackburn	in the worst mean of these words
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@dslb-088-074-124-160.pools.arcor-ip.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 255 seconds]
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: it fails pretty bad lot of times
 n4nd0	if happens to me sometimes that I click on "save and continue" and errors start popping up
-!- hoijui_ [~hoijui@dslb-088-074-124-160.pools.arcor-ip.net] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	n4nd0: which errors?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it couldn't be save, try again later
 n4nd0	I ended up not using save and continue
 sonne|work	I mean I don't mind to return to using just a raw text form
 sonne|work	n4nd0: when did that occur and what do you have to do for that?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it has occurred when I have added some info in the webpage, for the workshop program for example that I remember now
 sonne|work	n4nd0: speeking of which please add the date to the schedule :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hehe sure
 sonne|work	n4nd0: and if the problem occurs again tell it to us
 n4nd0	sonne|work: error occurred :)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so what do you do exactly?
 n4nd0	I edited on workshop2013_program "in July" to "on July 12th"
 n4nd0	save and continue
 n4nd0	that worked fine
 sonne|work	and then?
 n4nd0	although I was directed to the same page but with poor formatting
 n4nd0	not the normal Django admin style page
 n4nd0	then I clicked save
 n4nd0	and
 n4nd0	An internal server error occurred. Please try again later.
 sonne|work	but that is not the editor then
 sonne|work	I wonder why we didn't receive an email with the exception
 n4nd0	sonne|work: this is what I mean with page with poor formatting http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/2013-03-19-113315_1600x900_scrot.png
 n4nd0	sonne|work: anyway the modification is fine
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I am not so worried about the formatting (IIRC reloading would fix this) but more about the internal server error...
 blackburn	sonne|work: how to say 'thanks, just in time' in german? :D
 blackburn	I do not trust google translate
 sonne|work	gerade noch rechtzeitig
 sonne|work	but this sounds a bit negative
 blackburn	sonne|work: what about positive?
 blackburn	I am sorry to distract you - got curious to answer andreas in german
 sonne|work	no idea
 blackburn	alright ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: andreas from scikits?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, Ziehe
 blackburn	not mueller :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: ha pushing helps :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: pushing?
 sonne|work	blackburn: I've email andreas just an hour ago or so
 blackburn	ahh :)
 blackburn	they forgot I guess
 blackburn	sonne|work: let me kick some asses too :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: 3 ideas done
-!- heiko [~heiko@nat-187-2.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko: could you please fill in your gsoc idea?
 blackburn	I shared a doc
 heiko	blackburn: yes I saw it
 heiko	I will do it soon
 heiko	blackburn: and I will also help on the application
 heiko	blackburn: can you update me on the deadlines?
 blackburn	heiko: 29 march
 blackburn	heiko: so 10 days, pretty enough
 heiko	blackburn: ok, I will add some stuff tonight and continue to update this week
 heiko	blackburn: what do you think on a project on GP classification?
 heiko	(in case nobody wants to do the large sparse Gaussian stuff)
 heiko	could do: binary GP with laplace approx and EP, same for multiclass, unit-testing the existing stuff   ....and thats already a nice little project
 blackburn	heiko: mentor?
 heiko	blackburn:  me
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn: I implemented most of this stuff end of last year, not all though, but its all covered by the GP book
 blackburn	heiko: I never heard about these crazy letters so that's just a mentor availability
 heiko	blackburn: also, there is no multiclass GP implementation out there that is easy to use
 heiko	the book matlab toolbox doesnt contain multiclass
 heiko	EP=expectation propagation
 blackburn	GP, EP, laplace, go figure :D
 heiko	variational optimisation
 blackburn	heiko: jk
 heiko	haha :)
 heiko	GP=Grand prix
 heiko	multiclass GP = mens/woman Grand prix
 blackburn	heiko: ooh that's interesting!
 blackburn	heiko: it is out of law to mix up men and women here though!
 heiko	in Russia? :)
 blackburn	heiko: well not really out of law but pretty pressing
 blackburn	heiko: I'd kill myself if I was a gay in russia :D
 heiko	blackburn: yeah, you dont like gay guys
 n4nd0	any idea why trying to asign an numpy array of float64 to an SGVector<float64> fails in python_modular??
 heiko	n4nd0: it might be the form
 blackburn	heiko: that's because we are barbarians living in 1600 :)
 n4nd0	the error in particular is *** TypeError: in method 'ResultSet_psi_pred_set', argument 2 of type 'shogun::SGVector< float64_t > *'
 heiko	n4nd0: you  need [ [row 1] [row 2]]
 blackburn	n4nd0: assign?
 n4nd0	blackburn: =
 blackburn	n4nd0: that won't work
 n4nd0	heiko: it is a vector, just one row, or?
 heiko	blackburn:  Germany were also barbarians
 heiko	n4nd0: ah sorry
 blackburn	heiko: yes originally :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm why not? typemaps do not handle that?
 n4nd0	heiko: no problem :)
 heiko	n4nd0: I had this problem quite often
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, they handle only methods
 blackburn	AFAIK
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham I see
 heiko	n4nd0: sometimes the type has to be set explicitly with dtype="float64"
 heiko	I made this experience
 n4nd0	heiko: yep, I tried doing that
 heiko	strange
 blackburn	heiko: I am afraid assigning won't work with types
 heiko	I am doing that all the type
 blackburn	heiko: I think you misunderstood something! :)
 blackburn	heiko: if x is sgvector
 blackburn	x = numpy.array([3,4.0])
 blackburn	that won't work AFAIK
 heiko	ah I see
 blackburn	I mean it would work but x now is an array
 heiko	blackburn: I usually understand things wrong :D
 blackburn	heiko: set_pizza(numpy.array([3.0,4.0]))
 n4nd0	blackburn: I probably need to put a setter or the like to make it work then
 blackburn	heiko: you meant that?
 heiko	blackburn:  what I meant is I pass numpy arrays to methods that require an sgvector all the time
 n4nd0	heiko: yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	I thought also that meant you could do =
 n4nd0	but it seems not :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: you just assign it to new thing
 heiko	n4nd0: ah I see, so you have a sgvector and want to replace its content so that somebody else implicitly does something different
 n4nd0	blackburn: the thing is since this is a field or an struct
 n4nd0	it doesn't let me do it directly
 n4nd0	field of* an struct
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you provide an example?
 heiko	blackburn:  whats the desired field in the gsoc?
 n4nd0	struct CResultSet { SGVector<float64_t> psi; }
 n4nd0	from python I am doing
 blackburn	heiko: field?
 blackburn	heiko: ahh
 blackburn	heiko: I meant desired skills or so
 n4nd0	result_set.psi = method_that_gives_numpy_array()
 blackburn	heiko: feel free to update it with something better
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, it needs a setter
 heiko	and the difference to prerequisites?
 n4nd0	blackburn: all right, thanks!
 blackburn	heiko: prereqs are must, desired is would be better - I meant that
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 n4nd0	what about a director class with a method returning a numpy array
 n4nd0	where the return value of that method in C++ is defined to be an SGVector
 n4nd0	it fails for some reason
 n4nd0	TypeError: SWIG director type mismatch in output value of type 'shogun::SGVector< float64_t >'
 sonne|work	n4nd0: code signature?
 n4nd0	virtual SGVector< float64_t > get_joint_feature_vector(int32_t feat_idx, CStructuredData* y);
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ^
 n4nd0	I don't really get why the typemap doesn't handle this
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so you get back a SGVector?
 sonne|work	in python I mean?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yes, SGVector is the return value
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, I am doing a StructuredModel in python using directors
 n4nd0	sonne|work: and I am writing this get_joint_feature_vector method in python
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well then use vec.get_vector()
 n4nd0	sonne|work: in python? vec would be the numpy array?
 n4nd0	mmm no, I guess no
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no vec would be SGVector
 sonne|work	and then vec.get()
 sonne|work	it will give you a numpy translated SGVector
 sonne|work	n4nd0: but note that you can do things like vec +=1 IIRC
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but how can I get and SGVector from python??
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I mean, is it possible to create a new SGVector from python interface?
 sonne|work	sure
 sonne|work	RealVector()
 sonne|work	not typically used but I've seen heiko abusing it :)
 heiko	sonne|work: yep :) but not necessary actually
 n4nd0	heiko, sonne|work : and how would you create the SGVector from the numpy array?
 n4nd0	I'd rather avoid setting element by element
 n4nd0	but I don't manage to get anything to work using the constructor
 sonne|work	heiko: btw http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Shogun-2.1.0-bringt-hunderte-Verbesserungen :)
 heiko	n4nd0: I dont understand, you can pase numpy arrays to functions that accept SGVectors right?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: looks like we don't have a convenience constructor for that yet - you could create a vector of appropriate size, zero it and += a numpy array to it
 heiko	sonne|work: haha
 heiko	great :)
 n4nd0	heiko: for some reason the SGVector constructor that accepts another SGVector constructor doesn't work for this
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well it needs no const whatever crap
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok - out of curiosity, why the SGVector constructor that gets another SGVector doesn't work in this case?
 heiko	n4nd0: weird
 n4nd0	sonne|work: aaah because of the const
 heiko	sonne|work: they also  mentioned the c-base workshop!
 sonne|work	n4nd0: you need SGVector(SGVector vec);
 sonne|work	then it would work
 sonne|work	heiko: yeah cool isn't it?
 heiko	sonne|work: indeed cool
 heiko	sonne|work: did they mention us before?
 sonne|work	heiko: no idea - I accidentally stumbled upon this
 heiko	sonne|work: blackburn, I added my two project suggestions, feel free to feedback (will also continue to improve)
 heiko	time for lunch!
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@65.19.131.247] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: isn't weird that some_SGVector = some_numpy_array
 sonne|work	?
 n4nd0	doesn't work while it does work with +=
 blackburn	heiko: cool! thanks
 sonne|work	n4nd0: just write the operator!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah yeah, I am doing it like that, I am just wondering :D
 blackburn	heiko: haha what are you waiting for, an einstein?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: and the constructor too please :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: no he meant add operator= and it could work
 blackburn	(maybe)
 n4nd0	getting lost here :S
 blackburn	I am curious where can we find such students haha
 sonne|work	yes exactly n4nd0 please write the constructor and the operator=
 blackburn	Prerequisites: C++, (sparse) numerical linear algebra (positive definiteness, trace, Cholesky decomposition, Eigenvalues,iterative methods for linear systems (conjugate gradients), preconditioning), Basic probability theory: ( Gaussian distributions and manipulating them, expected value and variance), Graph colourings
 n4nd0	blackburn: lol yeah, maybe some of those are more things the student will work with than actual reqs
 n4nd0	at least IMO
 sonne|work	blackburn: would you qualify?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am afraid no
 sonne|work	scary isn't it?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah so heiko needs someone more qualified than me and probably you :D
 n4nd0	indeed
 n4nd0	the scary I meant
 blackburn	sonne|work: well preconditioners and conj gradient are most specific - most know what it is but I can't say I deeply understand that
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah an each set of algorithms in shogun is so specialized that there likely is just 1 shogun dev who *really* knows about it
 sonne|work	s/an//
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah, I don't know about string kernels at all and you probably don't know how these tapkee impls work
 blackburn	that's normal though I think
 sonne|work	yup
 sonne|work	and when ICA enters shogun then we have something only andreas and 1 student know about
 blackburn	sonne|work: I was scaried with his idea
 sonne|work	it is somehow crucial that we keep having experts for each ML domain
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is just some domain people avoid :D
 sonne|work	and for sure tests to ensure that this stuff does sth
 blackburn	sonne|work: not really a lot of references for that
 sonne|work	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ICA
 sonne|work	andreas' abstract was perfect
 sonne|work	wikipedia then
 blackburn	sonne|work: no I mean in machine learning ICA is not well acknowledged
 blackburn	and BSS problem at all
 sonne|work	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis
 sonne|work	but in signal processing
 sonne|work	and even ICA has its own conference
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is close to matrix factorization and etc
 blackburn	sonne|work: so igor's ideas are close to
 blackburn	too*
 blackburn	sonne|work: I don't like any separation - math is the same
 blackburn	so that's quite nice we can unify things here in shogun
 sonne|work	thats true
 sonne|work	after all that is what is shogun for
 n4nd0	my SSVM learning for grid CRFs is crap :D
 sonne|work	?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am implementing this in python using the DirectorStructuredModel
 n4nd0	but the results are bad - I have to debug it
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what I mean graphically, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/2013-03-19-150607_1600x900_scrot.png
 n4nd0	top row is ground truth and bottom prediction
 sonne|work	n4nd0: not totally random though :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hehe, I have (at least) a bug for sure

 heiko	blackburn: I found out how to store matrix factor for later use
 blackburn	heiko: insight me!
 heiko	x = L.triangularView<Lower>().solve(b);
 heiko	x = L.triangularView<Lower>().adjoint().solve(x); 
 heiko	where L is the factor
 blackburn	heiko: ohh nice to know!
 heiko	simply do this "double backslash" solve that you might know from matlab
 heiko	quite cool
 blackburn	heiko: no matlab is a foreign thing for me :)
 blackburn	heiko: that's quite cool!
 heiko	blackburn: you do often
 heiko	L=chol(A)
 heiko	inv(A)*b equals to L\L'\b
 heiko	but whatever
 heiko	same idea
 heiko	trianular solver
 heiko	cool stuff this library
 heiko	and also actively maintained :)
 blackburn	heiko: hah much more better than blas thing
 heiko	thats a good trick if one has to solve multiple systems with the same matrix
 heiko	one can simply store the cholesky
 heiko	and then its very fast
 heiko	blackburn: yes much better
 heiko	I will put it into the GP project: replace all lapack/blas calls by eigen :)
@sonney2k	apologies guys
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?

 blackburn	heiko: eigen3 is well tested also - you may like it
 heiko	blackburn: I know, it passes the blas testsuite :)
 heiko	blackburn:  thats crucial for these things
 heiko	imagine your solver returns nonsense :)
 heiko	will never find that bug
 heiko	blackburn:
 blackburn	friends presented me a toy helicopter I am playing around
 heiko	http://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=74
 heiko	thats a good ressource
 blackburn	heiko: yes, though sometimes I think they lack some doc
 heiko	indeed, I found the thing in the forum
 blackburn	heiko: btw I think we should use stackoverflow as that kind of forum
 heiko	how can we do that?
 blackburn	heiko: just subscribe to shogun tag at stackoverflow
 wiking	heiko: yo
 heiko	blackburn: good idea, we could also  mention on the website
 heiko	wiking: hi
 heiko	was just about to leave :)
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	talk to u then anoher time
 wiking	:>
 heiko	wiking: I will be here tonight or if not tomorrow
 heiko	but its already 7 and still at work, should go home :)
 heiko	see you later all
 wiking	laterz

@sonney2k	blackburn, now you know
@sonney2k	lots of fixing needed to get this stuff operational again
