@sonney2k	so heiko any ideas what else will be on the e.v. todo?
@sonney2k	bern4rd:I keep getting errors when editing the website from admin interface.
 heiko	we need a gr?ndungsprotokoll
 bern4rd	what are you editing? what kind of errors?
 heiko	which is the transcription of the meeting, a vorstand has to be voted
 heiko	actually, check this site:
 heiko	http://www.bmj.de/DE/Buerger/gesellschaft/Vereinsrecht/_doc/Gruendung.html;jsessionid=4FDAE9EF430B7454E3408C80955AB8E1.1_cid102?nn=1955982
 heiko	sonney2k, the satzung is the main thing to start with
 heiko	once that is one with the protocoll, we can go to a notar
@sonney2k	and once that is done ?
 heiko	its in the vereinregister
@sonney2k	heiko: tell bern4rd what you were editing.
 heiko	after that convince the finanzamt to grant us tax reductions
 heiko	I dont know how to do that
@sonney2k	heiko: and then how much effort is it to maintain the e.v.
 heiko	bern4ard, I wanted to add a line
 heiko	Framework for statistical hypothesis testing with algorithms for kernel  based two-sample and independence testing by Heiko Strathmann
 heiko	I think its the yearls report
@sonney2k	heiko url please...
 heiko	and every meeting/change has to be documented
 heiko	sonney2k, http://www.bmj.de/DE/Buerger/gesellschaft/Vereinsrecht/_doc/Gruendung.html;jsessionid=4FDAE9EF430B7454E3408C80955AB8E1.1_cid102?nn=1955982
 heiko	we would do a "Verein zur F?rderung des SHOGUN Projektes" or similar
 heiko	sonney2k, there are also templates on that page
 bern4rd	where are you adding the line? And what is the error?
@sonney2k	heiko:^
 heiko	bern4rd, I log in, change to the news for SHOGUN 2.0 and click on edit
 heiko	the error is:
 heiko	bern4rd
 heiko	http://pastebin.com/MkxqfKnx
 heiko	sonney2k, lets talk about the verein next week, I can setup documents btw once I am finished with the studying stuff....
 heiko	I will call the ensurance tomorrow to get my tax free limit, but since I did not work this year I think it should be fine
 heiko	its 4000USD right?
 bern4rd	in settings.py change DEBUG to True and the error will be explained better.
@sonney2k	heiko, ~6k$
 heiko	bern4ard I have no clue of django, I dont know how to do this
 heiko	sonney2k, ok, noted
@sonney2k	heiko, please do again
@sonney2k	(I just did this)
 heiko	sonney2k, bern4ard, http://pastebin.com/NhFEdERm
 heiko	sonney2k, I will disappear again for the rest of the week btw, sorry for that - its last days before deadline now ;)
 bern4rd	problems with the db, there is a primary key that is duplicated
 bern4rd	are you creating a new? editing one?
 heiko	bern4ard editing
 heiko	have a try yourself, add en empty line to the news
 bern4rd	no.
 bern4rd	are you editing the content?
@sonney2k	heiko, sure
 bern4rd	right no I am not using my computer and I dont have ubuntu so I cannot check myself
@sonney2k	Hmmh ran out of battery
@sonney2k	back to using mobile...
@sonney2k	bern4rd: I had that same problem when adding users...
 bern4rd	I write it down
@sonney2k	I guess we will be polishing the website quite a bit in the next days.
 heiko	yeah no worries about that ...

 blackburn	hey there
 sonne|work	ho
 blackburn	sonne|work: will logs get back?
 sonne|work	blackburn: logs?
 blackburn	sonne|work: irclogs doesn't work
 sonne|work	ahh
 blackburn	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/
 sonne|work	sure but cannot do it from here
 blackburn	okay
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn: anything else taht is missing?
 blackburn	sonne|work: not really
 blackburn	sonne|work: ah
 blackburn	buildbot too
 blackburn	just updated version at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_(toolbox)
 sonne|work	blackburn: buildbot is there
 blackburn	sonne|work: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot
 sonne|work	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/
 sonne|work	:D
 sonne|work	works
 blackburn	wtf
 blackburn	works now too
 sonne|work	not the trailing /
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	that's confusing
 blackburn	is it a feature of django?
 sonne|work	no but you have to note that buildbot is its own server, doc too and the website now too and they all run under the same www.shogun-toolbox.org domain
 sonne|work	so there is some url name matching done to figure out which server to run things at
 sonne|work	blackburn: which density estimators do we have in shogun?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ehmm no density estimators? :)
 blackburn	well may be one could use some nonlinear regression for that
 blackburn	but it is not the spirit for sure
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you need it?
 sonne|work	yeah...
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw I don't know whether you know
 sonne|work	but we aim for not doing any (intrusive) changes at the moment but just get things more stable / nice
 sonne|work	and one important thing here is described in README.soname
 blackburn	I didn't plan anything intrusisve next weeks (I think so)
 sonne|work	basically whenever one changes a .h file - we've made an intrusive change
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	we are not apache neither weblogic or anything
 sonne|work	of course if you change a .cpp file and a function foo() that then does no longer compute max() but min() then too
 blackburn	we can't keep headers non-touched
 blackburn	it would work if we were a grep
 blackburn	or a vim
 sonne|work	blackburn: we need some nice blog post for shogun...
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am a bad man for that :D
 sonne|work	and announcements at freshmeat, mloss.org, python mailinglist, octave mailinglist etc
 blackburn	ich bin ploho znau english language :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I talked to scikits team yesterday
 blackburn	I asked about python conferences to present shogun
 blackburn	basically they all will take place next summer
 sonne|work	sure
 blackburn	so a lot haha quite a lot time to prepare
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you know whether universities recognize these types of conferences?
 blackburn	in your country for example?
 blackburn	by recognize I mean support a travel
 sonne|work	no idea - depends on professor
 sonne|work	btw, I think what is missing to shogun is certainly ensemble methods (boosting...)
 blackburn	haha I see you need to fulfill some needs at job
 sonne|work	trees
 sonne|work	density estimation
 blackburn	sonne|work: why do you need density estimation?
 blackburn	well actually it is quite easy to implement
 sonne|work	btw for things like http://shogun-toolbox.org/bigpicture/em1d.png we should have the code producting the figure underneath
 blackburn	I wanted to add some compressive sensing actually
 blackburn	and CRF model

@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build "rpm1 - libshogun"
 shogun-buildbot	build #5 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey! I think there's something wrong with the webpage
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/
 n4nd0	that goes to the main page here
@sonney2k	n4nd0, fixed
@sonney2k	anything else?
 n4nd0	cool
-!- cronor [~cronor@f052051184.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the weblog tab is empty
 n4nd0	there appears no content there
 n4nd0	should it be like that?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I thought you will write something :D
@sonney2k	btw did anyone write anything under our twitter?
 n4nd0	I wrote a couple of tweets regarding the new release
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but something about what? I have not so clear the idea of what should appear in the weblog
@sonney2k	n4nd0, hmmhh maybe we should merge news and weblog?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, one thing - gsoc announcements etc should somehow appear on the front page
 n4nd0	do you mean feature ones?
 n4nd0	about merging weblog and news, I still don't know what weblog represents so I don't know :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sorry, typo there, future gsocs I meant
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I guess a blog / some news announcements?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham, then I think that it makes sense to have it together with news
 n4nd0	I believe there's already a blog about shogun
@sonney2k	where?
@sonney2k	ahh our planet is missing too
 shogun-buildbot	build #5 of rpm1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/rpm1%20-%20libshogun/builds/5
 n4nd0	yeah, that one
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/planet/
@sonney2k	ok fixed that one too
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I think we need about / documentation / license / contact above only
@sonney2k	ohh got to leave train
@sonney2k	cu
 n4nd0	bye
