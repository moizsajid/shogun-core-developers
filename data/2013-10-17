@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hey
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I lost the pie chart with the language statistics that was in the website. Do you happen to know the link to put it back?

 lisitsyn	fantastic four here?
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	sonne|work: Sounds nice!  Any IP/Url for a sneak preview?
 sonne|work	besser82: so we should have some demo on the website in the next days
 sonne|work	besser82: not yet but no time  today (my flight is tomorrow at 7 and I didn't prepare anything and still at work etc...)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: please do a nice dimred notebook!
 besser82	sonne|work: Argh!  Sounds like you are in an urgent hussle then... :(
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: I'll try asap I promise :)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: I am just like working 9hrs/day last weeks so having troubles with time
 sonne|work	besser82: no I am relaxed .. no talks or anything there so I can just work here and then on way to the plane setup the server etc

@iglesiasg	wiking, hey
@iglesiasg	wiking, how are you doing?
 sonne|work	wiking: debian sid
 wiking	iglesiasg: booting
 wiking	how about u?
@iglesiasg	wiking, good good -- working hard to finish up the master thesis
 wiking	heheh same here just about the phd
@iglesiasg	hehe
@iglesiasg	I feel your pain then :P
@iglesiasg	wiking, have you got any plans what to do afterwards?
 wiking	none
@iglesiasg	into the wild then
@iglesiasg	wiking, did you see there seems to be something fishy with Matlab static installation?
 wiking	mmm haven't tested it that much
 wiking	what's exactly the problem?
 wiking	or the error?
@iglesiasg	wiking, there is no error in the compilation or installation
@iglesiasg	but this mexa file is not created
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i still need to finish up some of the static interfaces
 wiking	so i'll take a look at it
@iglesiasg	that would be great
@iglesiasg	wiking, do you have any clue where might the problem be?
 wiking	iglesiasg: honestly no..
 wiking	but i think maybe i did a  mistake when implementing the interface
 wiking	but i'll only able to do this when i fix the other static interfaces
 wiking	let's hope that this'll be by this weekend :S
 sonne|work	wiking: and upload the workshop videos of course

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sonne|osx hey guys
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: hey there
@iglesiasg	btw, how did it come that we got documentation in Chinese?
@iglesiasg	I have always wondered
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx: hey hey
@iglesiasg	I was wondering, our examples page http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/examples sucks, a lot
@iglesiasg	I guess the parts under screenshots and applications will go away when demos are ready, right?
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: well we had a chinese asking if he could provide the documentation in chinese
@iglesiasg	makes sense :)
 sonne|osx	maybe we should put the api examples there somehow nicely shaped up
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx: mmm
 sonne|osx	I mean there is some code syntax highlighting thing in python that we could use to systematically display our examples
@iglesiasg	I wouldn't do that in a page external to the repository like this one
@iglesiasg	if we want to have that kind of stuff, then I would go for using the gh-pages branch and so
@iglesiasg	the problem I see with doing that is that we start having the same things in two places and updating get cumbersome if don't prepare something to do it automatically

 naywhayare	I have a question about the shogun kernel pca implementation that I suspect one of you guys can answer very quickly
 naywhayare	is it the standard KPCA implementation (calculate kernel matrix, eigendecompose it, project onto eigenvectors) or is it something else that works better with larger matrices?
 naywhayare	I am trying to find some implementations of KPCA that use tricks to speed it up, because for large datasets calculation of the kernel matrix can be quite slow :)
 wiking_	okkeeey
 wiking_	i've realised
 wiking_	that we need a docker image for shogun
 wiking_	that'll be the best :)

@sonney2k	naywhayare, but ask lisitsyn maybe he has sth better in mind :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: naywhayare: I don't recall if there is anything special for that
 lisitsyn	nystrom or whatever?
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: you can also compute kernel matrix on the fly
 lisitsyn	low performance but fits to memory
 naywhayare	lisitsyn: yeah, I'm looking for some implementation of the nystrom method or something like that
 naywhayare	performance is what I'm more interested in at the moment.  there are some matlab implementations out there, but they tend to be of very variable quality

 lisitsyn	naywhayare: what's the size?
 naywhayare	however large I can make it.  I'm comparing an idea of my own against other implementations
 naywhayare	for well-behaved datasets I think I can get up towards 100k? haven't tested that high yet.  most implementations I've been working with seem to top out at about 10k
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: uhm I see
