 Saurabh7	wiking: hi,
@wiking	Saurabh7, hi
 Saurabh7	wiking: I missed your ping ysterday
 Saurabh7	wiking: btw omp_set_dynamic(0); is being done in parallel.cpp,
 Saurabh7	which leads to slower parallel kmeans for some reason
@wiking	Saurabh7: i'm currently trying to find why crossval multithread with libsvm gets deadlocked
 Saurabh7	wiking: the unit test
 Saurabh7	?
 Saurabh7	Iwill look into it then, is it the locked or unlocked version ?
@wiking	unlocked
@wiking	but it only happens with msvc
 Saurabh7	uhm there is a test for libsvm unlocked
 Saurabh7	multiclass lemme check
@wiking	actually knn fails as well.... but libsvm gets stuck
