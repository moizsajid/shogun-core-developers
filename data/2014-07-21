@besser82	lisitsyn, hey-yo!
@lisitsyn	besser82: hey
@besser82	lisitsyn, gonna see ya on the sg-workshop in person?
@lisitsyn	besser82: ohh no not really
@lisitsyn	I wish I was there
@lisitsyn	besser82: I am moving to moscow tomorrow
@besser82	lisitsyn, ahh  =)  Got a good $$$-job?
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheheh have a safe trip
@lisitsyn	heh wiking thanks
@lisitsyn	train is quite safe :D
@lisitsyn	besser82: yandex
@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, ic :D
@wiking	lisitsyn: u never know nowadays :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: russian trains are slow :D
@lisitsyn	so quite safe
@lisitsyn	wiking: actually I just have a sh*tload of things to carry
* besser82 thinks missle might be faster then  :-P

@wiking	lisitsyn: hehehe i know the feeling
@lisitsyn	wiking: I have to learn to live like you
@lisitsyn	with a small bag :D
@wiking	:DDD
@wiking	have fun
@wiking	it's good because u never have shit around
@wiking	:P
@lisitsyn	wiking: how do you like singapore?
@wiking	khalednasr: seems the fix for c# will do it ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheh it's fun
@wiking	lisitsyn: a lot of different stuff
@wiking	and it's very humid :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: is there any country you have on your checklist?
@lisitsyn	to live in? :D
 khalednasr	wiking, great!
@wiking	mmm lisitsyn dunno yet
@wiking	khalednasr: now it's only that python script ;P
@lisitsyn	ohh is it a script of mine
@lisitsyn	neuralnets?
@lisitsyn	wiking: ^
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, yeah
@lisitsyn	oops sorry guys
@wiking	lisitsyn: btw dunno what happened in the last 3 months but travis + buildbot got uterly fucked up :)))
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh I tell you
@lisitsyn	it fucked up
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheheh i didnt' check with git blame who did it really
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	wiking: it was me
@wiking	i automatically presumed that it's khalednasr work
@wiking	lisitsyn: plz fix as it's failing now...
@lisitsyn	ssure thing
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'm gradually moving to be green on both travis and buildbots :P
@lisitsyn	wiking: with swig 3.0.2 I have
@lisitsyn	everything crashes
@lisitsyn	every python example
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheheh no shit :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: same for me....
@lisitsyn	let me install other one
@besser82	same here  :-P
@wiking	lisitsyn: i thought it's something to do with osx
@wiking	but seems then it's swig 3.x
@lisitsyn	no its swig
* besser82 thinks SWIG 3.X makes everything modular crash...
@lisitsyn	Unpack_Tuple
@lisitsyn	some crazy things going on
@lisitsyn	wiking: ahh I have a few questions about osx for you
@lisitsyn	gonna catch you a bit later
@wiking	lisitsyn: k
@lisitsyn	I am going to use osx at new job so want to know some things
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, wiking I think I've fixed it :)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: oh good to hear
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: what's that
@lisitsyn	?
@wiking	khalednasr: can u push it then to that pr? :)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, the script
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: no I mean what caused it?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, wiking check the PR https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2404/files#diff-c5f3b04ae600597c306a7ea3d554b64cL18
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	apply_multiclass(labels)
@lisitsyn	sorry about that
@lisitsyn	but why it crashed?
@wiking	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2404#issuecomment-49599200
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, doing NeuralLayers().input().linear(). .. causes it to crash for some reason
@wiking	hopefully this'll fix things and then we get couple of green jobs on travis
@wiking	:)
 khalednasr	you have to do something like layers = NeuralLayers() and then layers.input().linear() instead
@wiking	i reckon maybe c++11 with swig is still doing some crazy stuff
@lisitsyn	bahh
@wiking	as that's the new stuff that got introduced in swig 3.x (apart from some others)...
@lisitsyn	btw guys
@wiking	will try to debug now
@lisitsyn	I tried shared_ptr
@lisitsyn	with swig
@lisitsyn	well, it works :D
@lisitsyn	so once gsoc is done I think it would be a good timing
@lisitsyn	to kill sg_ref/unref
@lisitsyn	it is stupid to maintain this things manually
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	khalednasr: green cool i'll merge this pr then. thnx for the fixes
 khalednasr	wiking, cool! thanks for pointing out the problems :)

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: hey
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, so, regular neuralnets can be gpu-ized now :)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: wow!
@lisitsyn	congrats
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I thought we are more far away from this point
 khalednasr	most of basic methods are there now
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: awesome
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, only two main things are missing  for gpu-izing the whole module: convolution and random number generation
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I see
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, we need to merge this with develop soon
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: yes agree
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: let me know if I can help you
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: though I am unavailable tomorrow and probably day after tomorrow as wel
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, i will :)
