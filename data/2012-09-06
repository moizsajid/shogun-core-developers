 blackburn	sonne|work: oh well
 sonne|work	we better mention him in 2.0.1 :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: 9 critical level tickets here
 blackburn	I start to hate that
 sonne|work	http://freecode.com/projects/shogun/date_metrics
 blackburn	sonne|work: LLTSA author? heheh
 sonne|work	nice right :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: I thought this is the motivation you need.
 blackburn	yeah kind of

 blackburn	sonne|work: and what is number of downloads?
 sonne|work	no idea
 sonne|work	we don't monitor this
 sonne|work	usually between 100 and 300 unique visitors per days (has the website)
 blackburn	sonne|work: we've got no mentions on any website this time :(
 sonne|work	blackburn: we didn't write any blog post yet...
 sonne|work	blackburn: and we don't have nice figures - so it is hard for me to blog this time

 blackburn	sonne|work: I have free 3 days from tomorrow may be I'll come with something
 blackburn	free from that damned
 blackburn	support
 blackburn	n4nd0: can HMM recognize strategy of flipping a coin?
 blackburn	i.e. if we learn it on
 blackburn	0101010101
 blackburn	or
 blackburn	11111100000
 blackburn	or 000111000111000
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you always use the same coin?
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh, wait
 blackburn	I think it is not a fair coin :D
 n4nd0	I mean if the probability of tail and head is always the same
 blackburn	what I meant is can it learn to recognize that?
 blackburn	3 zeros, 3 ones
 n4nd0	is the prob. of tail and head always the same?
 blackburn	4 zeros, 4 ones
 blackburn	etc
 blackburn	let it be not a coin anymore
 n4nd0	??
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha ok...
 blackburn	forget what I said before, from the beginining
 blackburn	I show you one or two fingers
 blackburn	with some strategy I know
 blackburn	can you learn a HMM that will adapt to my strategy?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	there is a couple of details though
 n4nd0	the thing would be like
 n4nd0	sometimes you follow one strategy where the prob. of 1 finger is x and of two fingers is 1-x
 n4nd0	other times you follow another strategy where the prob. ...
 n4nd0	you may change between strategies
 blackburn	I am just thinking of graphical example of HMMs
 n4nd0	the only thing I can see is the fingers you show me
 n4nd0	that can be modelled easily with an HMM
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean to put some nice related to HMMs in the webpage or in graphical examples?
 blackburn	n4nd0: webpage/blog post
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	they use HMMs in bioinformatics quite a bit
 n4nd0	and they have nice plots
 n4nd0	maybe sonne|work can point out something useful for this
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah but we would need 4 state model
 blackburn	or we end with limited thymine and adenine alphabet :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw do you know why 4 aminoacids are there?
 n4nd0	I don't know anything about aminoacids
 sonne|work	blackburn: what is wrong with the loaded cube example (that we already have)?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ?
 sonne|work	I created an example where 3 dices (all loaded) are drawn
 blackburn	n4nd0: a little more than 3 is the optimal base for a numeral system
 sonne|work	the HMM is used to learn the distribution that one can draw from each dice and when which dice is used
 blackburn	sonne|work: I've never seen that example :D
 blackburn	where?
 sonne|work	octave_static/graphical/hmm.m
 sonne|work	example is probably 8 years old :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: well, there is nothing wrong with it except I've never seen that working :)
 blackburn	I'll run it once I get home
 sonne|work	yeah old code in static if's
 blackburn	that would take a few hours today, switching city
 blackburn	I wish my mom gave me a teleport

 dan_	Hi, I am trying to install shogun with MOSEK and CPLEX support but ./configure fails to find those lib
 dan_	How can I add "/usr/local/Aimms/3.12.6/Solvers" to shogun links ? thats the path where libmosek.so, libcplex.so are. Thanks.
 sonne|work	dan_: ./configure --libs
 dan_	thanks but MOSEK and CPLEX support are still not found ..
 dan_	Is there a configure output example with CPLEX support ?

 jogin	Hello, I have some data for training and afterwards testing by python interface. As I see in shogun examples, I need my data in *.dat format. And that's my question - how can I create *.dat format? Can I find somewhere a sample?
@sonney2k	jogin, no just load your data with python and pass a numpy matrix
@sonney2k	(and use the python_modular interface!!)

@sonney2k	blackburn, alive?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeap
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's up? wanna make me fixing that crash? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes!
@sonney2k	do it!
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@141.23.65.251] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	okayy let me pack my code for gsoc now and I will check
 blackburn	locality preserving projections right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes - fails when arpack is not available
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh okay
 blackburn	easy tehn
 blackburn	sonney2k: so you will visit NY?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not easy - it does sth in the atlas call
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah
@sonney2k	...which fails
 blackburn	sonney2k: still - easy
@sonney2k	then please do it
 blackburn	doing
@sonney2k	it is blocking me doing things on the new bb
 blackburn	oh blocker issue
 blackburn	I fscking love it
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	QA always says the issue I work on blocks everything
 blackburn	we can't start nuclear war!
@sonney2k	luckily you slow down the process :)
@sonney2k	so war can wait :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I just figured out why I got tons of errors on the web site
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	sqlite does auto_increment per default on primary (integer!) keys
@sonney2k	but mysql does not
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	then enable it
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	that is whay I did
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah so it is just a bad matrix
 blackburn	not a real bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: here you go
 CIA-35	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r2e41877 / examples/undocumented/libshogun/converter_localitypreservingprojections.cpp : Better data matrix for LPP example - http://git.io/2FlrvQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
@sonney2k	what is a bad matrix?
 blackburn	sonney2k: should work now
 blackburn	sonney2k: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ...
 blackburn	is a bad feature matrix
 blackburn	for *any* dim red algorithm
@sonney2k	so data was too tough for this example to ever work?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	unsolvable generalized eigenvalue problem
 blackburn	we could regularize but I am lazy to integrate regularization to LPP
 blackburn	and I am not sure it is not an idiot way
@sonney2k	yeah ok good enough now
@sonney2k	I fixed a few issues on the website
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll try to come up with pics and may be skeleton of post

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi
 n4nd0	hi all :)
@sonney2k	I guess it is time that you both blackburn, n4nd0 do some edits on the website yourself
 blackburn	sonney2k: give me give me
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you want to see new?
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be we could afford to put ocr example online?
 blackburn	how to make an octave plot stay?
 shogun-buildbot	build #8 of rpm1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/rpm1%20-%20libshogun/builds/8
 blackburn	--persist okay
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: have you seen that ticket? http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/15308
@sonney2k	blackburn, yay! you did it ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've run hmm graphical exmaple
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is going on here?
 blackburn	should estimated path be equal to true path?
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/Screenshot%20from%202012-09-06%2022%3A58%3A51.png
 blackburn	I am a kind of lobotomy victim too so hard to understand
 blackburn	meanwhile in the scikits ML guys discuss large scale data - 1G
 blackburn	lol
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes please add the flash thing under the applications link
@sonney2k	(good exercise btw :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding hmm
 blackburn	sonney2k: no I meant may be
@sonney2k	perfect result!
 blackburn	put it online really?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not maybe do it!
 blackburn	*active*
@sonney2k	active?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I want to see fixes ... the site has many bad/broken links and missing info
 blackburn	yes, I think how difficult is to make an java application or so
 blackburn	can we run a java application out there?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no just the flash back is sufficient!
@sonney2k	no java crap
 blackburn	what is not a crap?
@sonney2k	(flash crap is bad enough)
@sonney2k	exactly
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding hmm - it shows the states 1...3 corresponding to when which cube was drawn
 blackburn	sonney2k: so hmm is not broken?
@sonney2k	blackburn, so it is *perfect* result
@sonney2k	why should it be broken?
@sonney2k	only parallel hmm did not work
 blackburn	no, tests are failing still
@sonney2k	ahh and note that it cannot know whether dice 2 is dice 1 or vice versa
@sonney2k	so things might be swapped (just have different name)
@sonney2k	and distributions should also match pretty well
 blackburn	I feel braindamaged
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	time to do something stupid
 blackburn	ahh I wanted to make edrt use eigen3
@sonney2k	blackburn, but don't commit this in master branch...
@sonney2k	bugfix mode for now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will once it is ready
 blackburn	in month or two
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	recall it is my prolonged gsoc project?
@sonney2k	we should probably really create a dev branch an do things there
@sonney2k	blackburn, but more important we need a polished web site
 blackburn	yeah I received a strange passphrase
 blackburn	for schtazi
 blackburn	knock-knock who's there
@sonney2k	n4nd0, too of course
@sonney2k	heiko already tried to do some edits :D
 n4nd0	it will be my first contact with django!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, there is no django contact here ... just editing pages
@sonney2k	*argh* I overwrote the doc page with the unfixed one
@sonney2k	and there is no versioning nor undo :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is username for me? :D
@sonney2k	sergey
@sonney2k	blackburn, you didn't read your emails *tsss*
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you find a mail where you mentioned I am a sergey?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I received only schtazi passphrase
 n4nd0	blackburn: where do you log in?
 blackburn	admin/
 blackburn	n4nd0: ^
 blackburn	admin!!!/!!!
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for example we need links to the *latest* documentation, the current one and basically all older versions...
@sonney2k	0.10.0/  1.0.0/  1.1.0/  2.0.0/  2.0.1/  current@  latest@
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: why is it there a current and latest version?
 n4nd0	is latest cutting edge code in the repo and current the latest release?
 blackburn	exacltly
 n4nd0	blackburn: thanks ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know what is a 'position paper'?
 blackburn	for conference
 blackburn	ah found in description
 blackburn	A position paper presents an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and worth listening to, without the need to present completed research work and/or validated results. It is, nevertheless, important to support your argument with evidence to ensure the validity of your claims. 
 n4nd0	sonney2k: here we go with links to the different doc versions
 n4nd0	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/information
 n4nd0	time to bed
 n4nd0	good night!
 blackburn	n4nd0: may you have no segfaults in your dreams
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	thanks
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I won't leak either :P
