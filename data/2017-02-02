 mikeling	hey, why "./tests/unit/shogun-unit-test --gtest_filter=GaussianProcessRegression.apply_*" doesn't work for me even after I run make shogun-unit-test
 mikeling	ok the unit-test works, but I have no idea what't the meaning of the error my got
 mikeling	hi lisitsyn, could you give me some help on https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/197601158#L4013? I have no idea about this error
 mikeling	and how could I debug my code when the ctest told me unit-KNN has SegFault? I use lldb on OS X

@wiking	mikeling, still around?
 mikeling	wiking: yep
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	how do you run your cmake on your machine?
 mikeling	wiking: it's **cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON -DDEBUG=ON ../**
@wiking	ok
@wiking	you dont need DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS
@wiking	nor DDEBUG=ON
@wiking	but
@wiking	you should have
@wiking	-DBUILD_META_EXAMPLES=ON
@wiking	imo it's on by default by just in case
 mikeling	wiking: ok, I will try it right now. Thank you for your help!:)
@wiking	and note that some some part of knn
 mikeling	do you mean the error I got about knn unittest? could you tell me more specifically about that?
@wiking	ok so i was wondering if the falconn part might be using openmp
@wiking	that's why
@wiking	you might not be able to reproduce it on osx with clang compiler by defalt
@wiking	but i dont see any #pragma in the falconn code
@wiking	so that's not it
@wiking	so you should be able to reproduce
@wiking	locally
@wiking	btw if you run
@wiking	ctest
@wiking	everything is passing you?
@wiking	because for me it seems there are some serious errors in everyjob
@wiking	on travis
 mikeling	wiking: yeah, if I just use ctest and everything works for me
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	you might be missing some libraries?
@wiking	hence some code is just not being compiled?
@wiking	i'm not so sure
@wiking	but in worst case
@wiking	you could fire up a docker image :)
@wiking	and check it yourself
@wiking	imo there's a quite good docker implementation on osx already
 mikeling	wiking: oh, so let me use docker image and see what i can got. I'm not familiar with docker so it may every consuming before I got things right ;)
@wiking	well
@wiking	if you follow .travis.yml
@wiking	then you'll actually get what travis does
@wiking	locally
@wiking	actually
@wiking	if you figure that out
@wiking	could you write a couple of lines of markdown document
@wiking	how to do it
@wiking	i mean it's there
@wiking	just it'd be a good doc for everybody to share
@wiking	how to reproduce travis errors locally on your machine ;)
* wiking is being super lazy :P
 nagdev	wiking: I read up on all the work that has been done on the usual suspects project previously and I was thinking about working with KNN or neural nets. Do you know if anyone is already working on it?
@wiking	nagdev, mikeling is working on KNN atm
@wiking	i dont recall anybody working on nns
 mikeling	wiking: nagdev I'm working on this issue actually :) https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3507
 mikeling	wiking: sure, I will write all the things down if I figure out all the things. :)
 mikeling	sorry for the late reply, I just miss the message somehow
 nagdev	mikeling: so can I just start working on it with you or will I need some background?
 nagdev	I know KNNs in general

 mikeling	nagdev: yeah sure, actually I had commit a PR for that issue(https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608), but the SegFault stop me verify if all my code works
 mikeling	it will be great appreciate if you can check that code and give me some feedback
 nagdev	mikeling: Cool. Give me some time to read all the existing work and catch up. I'll start giving my inputs as soon as I'm done with that
 nagdev	wiking: couple more things. Firstly, the PCA implementation is already significantly faster than other toolboxes. Why is PCA still in the list of algorithms to be improved? Are there any further changes that need to be made in it?
 nagdev	Second, some of the algorithms listed in project list were already taken up in prev year's GSoC. Are they still not complete?
 mikeling	nagdev: oh great! Thank you :)
 mikeling	nagdev: BTW, are you going to apply GSoC this year? Which project you are interested in? if I may ask :)
@wiking	nagdev, mmm there's alway room for improvement :)
@wiking	i do not know actually in case of each and every model what needs to be improved
@wiking	but rest assured none of them is prefect :)
@wiking	just pick anything that is to your liking and nobody else if working on (you can figure this out from the open prs)
@wiking	or just do something that you find interesting
@wiking	and you reckon it would be a good feature to add
@wiking	and it's easy to add to shogun
@wiking	you do not need to necessarily stick to that list
@wiking	it's just giving u some ideas
@wiking	like for example we do not have a preprocessor
@wiking	that does one-hot encoding for a categorical variable
 nagdev	wiking: Sure. I think I'll start working on KNN only and figure out if there is something else that I can work on as well
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	since mikeling is alrready working on knn
@wiking	i would really suggest you to pick something else
@wiking	otherwise it's inevitable that you'll end up doing double work
@wiking	and as we would like you to take something on your own to see how you handle things ..... dont get me wrong collaboration is very good but as well getting deep into some parts of the code alone is important
 nagdev	yeah i understand
 nagdev	is it ok if I just lurk around to see how he's working because I'm fairly new to open source and don't know much about how to go around doing things. That's why I wanted to work with someone to start off
@wiking	nagdev, mmm the point of entrance tasks are actually this
@wiking	they are small
 nagdev	I'll just see how he's working (general direction and coding style)
 nagdev	ok
@wiking	fairly easy to get you started
@wiking	and it's quite autonomous
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	just pick anything from the entrance tasks
@wiking	try to fix it
@wiking	and send in a pr
@wiking	as soon as you send in a pr we can give you a hand
@wiking	tell you what is ok and what is wrong
@wiking	usually the first pr takes about 3-4-6 iterations
@wiking	till it gets actually merged
@wiking	there's really no better way to get started with this is to try and fail
@wiking	:)
 nagdev	ok sure. I'll try out some tasks.
 nagdev	mikeling: I'll only apply if shogun gets selected because afaik it is the only ML related project in the organization list. I'm mostly interested in projects which involve core ML implementation and improvement.
 nagdev	So from the available list, usual suspects, real life problem solving and shogun extension are my preferred options
 nagdev	Usual suspects seems to be the most likely in that.
 nagdev	In that too, I would prefer to work on PCA, KNN or neural nets as I'm working on some papers to improve the algorithms and it'd be great to translate that into actual, functioning code
 nagdev	wiking: the entrance task doesn't mean that I have to commit to the project right?
@wiking	what do you mean?
 nagdev	If i try to work on a bug on a particular algo (say GP), I can still switch to some other project (like NN) later right?
@wiking	sure
@wiking	then entrance is just about
@wiking	seeing how can you contribute/code/interract etc
 nagdev	so I was looking at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3054 and https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3513 to start with. There has been some work in these already. Is it still fine if I start with one of these?

 shogitter	(etotientz) are there no newcomer issues to solve at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=
 shogitter	(etotientz) I m interested in contributing here
 shogitter	(etotientz) maybe relevant to gsoc this year
