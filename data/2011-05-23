 blackburn	he, never heard about this measure
 serialhex	yeah, i think it's a US-only measure, as it was created during prohibition (when we temporarily outlawed alc thinking it would make ppl better, and only ended up making big $$$ for gangsters and the like)
 serialhex	it has something to do with how much alc is in a giant vat of moonshine (corn whisky)
 serialhex	hmm...  sonney2k, is there a way to have to dirs in the (for instance) "gcc -c example_wrap.c -I/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.6/i686-linux" line??  cause for some fscking stupid reason config.h isnt where ruby.h expects it to be...
 serialhex	my idea is to basically find both of those files relative to the current ruby & then include them in that line
 serialhex	nvm... i think i may have found the answer...
 blackburn	going to sleep some
 blackburn	serialhex: see ya
 serialhex	ok, nite blackburn
@bettyboo	zzz
 serialhex	:D bettyboo!!
@bettyboo	serialhex: x==y will cause theta/0
 blackburn	she divided by zero
 blackburn	get outta here :D
 blackburn	be right back in 12 hrs :D

@sonney2k	blackburn1, not that you don't know how to spent your time ;-)
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what?
-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
 blackburn	don't understand this offence :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, kudos definitely no offence!
 blackburn	anyway we planned to have a short meeting tonight
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/SergeyLisitsyn/shogun/commit/a67f0d90ea6be0ddfb4ec34cf792806299ad9736
 blackburn	don't you think it would be *slow*?
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you don't do the ASSERT stuff it will be as fast as accessing memory directly
@sonney2k	ahh and define it inline - can help...
 CIA-31	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * r2341f5f / (2 files in 2 dirs): add ruby vector typemap support - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/2341f5fc12f2382f17ffba8cf907ec441f9ef177
 CIA-31	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * r386b0cd / (2 files in 2 dirs): add ruby matrix typemap support - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/386b0cda1781e5295c801af921a19c077030eea4
 CIA-31	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * rba381a2 / (2 files): remove init_shogun/exit_shogun - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/ba381a2a0fe10cd8af3065199d513a8bf244d2d7
 blackburn	sonney2k: should we assert it?
 blackburn	some safety/speed tradeoff
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would suggest two functions - one that does safety checks and one that does not or alternatively have some define to disable /enable the checks
@sonney2k	I mean when developing it helps a lot to have error checks
@sonney2k	later on you don't want those if you excessively use these functions
 blackburn	sonney2k: but if there would be check it could be slow too
 blackburn	sonney2k: is there any way to exclude say get_(...) method from modular?
 blackburn	I mean it is ok we would use it internally (if we know what we are doing) but it is bad for modular interfaces
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes %ignore
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you like this way of doing it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't see an alternative
@sonney2k	we cannot sacrifice speed
@sonney2k	not that much
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeap
 blackburn	so, set() for safe and set_() for unsafe
 blackburn	good?
@sonney2k	the only alternative I see is to add some kind of block operations that then do all in one go and are fast
@sonney2k	not sure if we can always do this though
@sonney2k	I think python uses set and SET
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: but it is ok if class have method set
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes - the only problem will be that java modular will create a set / get function too
@sonney2k	but just check if I am right
 blackburn	what is the problem with java modular?

@sonney2k	blackburn, I think for public arrays swig generates a set / get function for every public variable
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	I forgot that SGMatrix is struct :D
 blackburn	*well so why I am doing it*
 blackburn	anyway matrix.matrix[i*matrix.num_rows+j] will work as good as get..
 blackburn	eh I'd rather work on mds :D
@bettyboo	blackburn, funny
 blackburn	not so
@sonney2k	blackburn, well give it a try
@sonney2k	if it compiles with java_modular I would happily add this
 blackburn	sonney2k: I renamed it to get_value anyway :)

@sonney2k	a much better name anyway :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/SergeyLisitsyn/shogun/commit/8b582645005e691ad4783259f945423939548b23
 blackburn	sth this way
@sonney2k	blackburn, i think it should be [i,j] -> [row,col]
 blackburn	okay
