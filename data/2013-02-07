@sonney2k	blackburn, I want to get rid of the static interfaces as much as possible
@sonney2k	what do you think shouldn't we try to only ship a *single* static sg interface
@sonney2k	I mean what used to be elwms before could be 'the static interface'
@sonney2k	all the rest goes away
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am ok with getting rid of static
 blackburn	we should get rid of legacy - it stops us
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is not reducing code complexity or anything it would just be the shogun-static interface
@sonney2k	at least this avoids confusion with shogun-python-static vs shogun-python-modular
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes ok it is complexity anyway
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd even go for removing the word modular
 blackburn	you, sonney2k and heiko, are hooligans closing wrong issues :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: randomized pca is not here yet
 blackburn	mea culpa description was ambiguous
 blackburn	but it needs kind of wrapper still
 blackburn	there is no class that does randomized pca
@sonney2k	blackburn, sounded like you do it in tapkee no?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I am just working on README and IMHO our interfaces are quite stable
@sonney2k	so I am removing all that alpha status stuff
@sonney2k	I mean we haven't had a single bug report...
@sonney2k	e.g. for java-modular
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you see any issues with ruby/lua/etc?
 blackburn	sonney2k: lua strings are broken
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am afraid main reason for no reports is that nobody uses it
@sonney2k	blackburn, then we should have a survey!

 blackburn	yeah we should
 blackburn	we should use the form similar to scikits
 blackburn	let me find it
 blackburn	sonney2k:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFdyeGNhMzlCRWZUdldpMEZlZ1B1YkE6MQ#gid=0
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd like to get survey from bioinformaticians - I believe we should make that part the best thing in shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would like to have the elwms features in the modular interfaces (being able to call octave / R /... from python)
