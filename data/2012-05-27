@sonney2k	blackburn, I added some stuff and at least now kernel.kernel() works
 blackburn	kernel.kernel()?
 blackburn	what's that?
@sonney2k	kernel.kernel(i,j)
@sonney2k	gives you k[i,j] :D
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	kernel(i,j)
@sonney2k	I don't udnerstand the error though
 blackburn	init one?
@sonney2k	init?
@sonney2k	there is no init
@sonney2k	the error is in get_kernel_matrix()
@sonney2k	and that is just calling kernel(i,j)
 blackburn	ah so what is the error?
@sonney2k	RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
 blackburn	argh
@sonney2k	but at least it still says returning kernel matrix of size 5x5
@sonney2k	so it enters get_kernel_matrix
 blackburn	sonney2k: looks like known bug of swig?
@sonney2k	wait not true
@sonney2k	that was for the get-kernel_matroix of the linear kernel
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	I googled - some issues
@sonney2k	sure but why does kernel(i,j) work?
 blackburn	different way of call I'd say
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	no
@sonney2k	hmmhh, one is using typemaps...
@sonney2k	it returns SGMatrix
@sonney2k	kernel(i,j) just double
@sonney2k	let me try sth
@sonney2k	blackburn, I now created a simple get_km()
@sonney2k	returning some sgmatrix
@sonney2k	directly from directorkernel
 blackburn	works?
@sonney2k	if that fails we will see
@sonney2k	compile time is much higher with directors...
@sonney2k	wrapper is much bigger
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes that works
 blackburn	so what is the reason?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea
@sonney2k	timings:
@sonney2k	0.7 sec for a 1000x1000 matrix w/ shogun
@sonney2k	15 sec with directors from python
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the reason between get_km and get_kernel_matrix?
 blackburn	errr
 blackburn	difference
@sonney2k	blackburn, again no idea
 blackburn	pthreads?
@sonney2k	btw the example crashes at the end
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, well I set threads=1
@sonney2k	(of course)
@sonney2k	it doesn't crash with gdb
@sonney2k	hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, also doesn't crash with valgrind
 blackburn	yes that happens sometimes
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you think gsomix can find out what is wrong?
 blackburn	give a chance :)
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	I will mail him the example then
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rd8a7270 / (2 files): add some helper functions for director kernel - http://git.io/nlEDig
@sonney2k	uhh ohh
@sonney2k	I have to sleep

 gsomix	fuf, I have returned to dorm.
 gsomix	time to work
 gsomix	sonney2k, blackburn,  hi
 blackburn	hey
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 blackburn	I tweaked it up to 97.82 :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey man, how is it going?
 n4nd0	blackburn: wow nice tweak then :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: what value were you aiming at?
 blackburn	no idea I just needed to overwhelm 97.00%
 n4nd0	objective achieved then
 blackburn	well.. before (in paper for that russian journal) I stated I 'can' recognize with 97.43 accuracy
 blackburn	so objective is rather 97.43
 blackburn	but achieved yeah
 n4nd0	congrats ;)
 blackburn	however I have not too much time now to get thesis itself done
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you have to write it completely?
 blackburn	yes needs to be 100% done before 7th June
 n4nd0	blackburn: you write it in Russian, right?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	:( it would be cool to read it otherwise
 blackburn	hah nothing special
 blackburn	I have nothing but HOG and SVM here
 blackburn	Crammer-Singer SVM + Homogeneous Kernel Map + HOG
 n4nd0	blackburn: I insist, probably interesting to read ;)
 blackburn	good thing being russian is direct access to vapnik's stuff

 gsomix	sonney2k, around
 gsomix	*?
 gsomix	hmm, nevermind :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, any news?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
 gsomix	get_kernel_matrix works.
 blackburn	sonney2k: to redeclare virtuals is the key :D
 gsomix	blackburn, tnx for fast description. :)
@sonney2k	k
@sonney2k	no more crashes?
 gsomix	sonney2k, hmm, I have not noticed more. but work in progress, need 15mins.
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about BSVM?
@sonney2k	blackburn, don't think it is worth it
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	but I haven't read the paper/mail :)
@sonney2k	gmnpsvm should be doing better
@sonney2k	we need something massively multiclass
 blackburn	MDM is cool yes but I do not think BSVM is slower
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok then another thing - strprtool has 5 solver for gmnp
 blackburn	solvers*
 blackburn	why do we have only mdm?
 blackburn	do not say ask vojtech :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, works. but this requires cleaning up
 gsomix	btw, feats_train.parallel.set_num_threads(2) -> segfault
 gsomix	sonney2k, can I commit/push it tomorrow?
 gsomix	tired, time to sleep =__=
