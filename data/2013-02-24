 lambday	hello.. this is soumyajit.. I have been trying with string kernels... was using fisher's protein homology detection data (http://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/discriminative/fisher-scop-data.tar.gz)...
 lambday	got an error "ALPHABET does not contain all symbols in histogram"... even after removing the sequences which contained something other than [A-Z]...
 lambday	was using PROTEIN alphabet...
 lambday	when I ran it with ALPHANUM, it worked... but none of the sequences had any digits
 lambday	and also, is the string subsequence kernel (http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume2/lodhi02a/lodhi02a.pdf or something similar) implemented in shogun? I was looking at the string kernels but couldn't find out :(

 blackburn	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	blackburn: hi
 n4nd0	blackburn: how is it going?
 blackburn	pretty fine

 nona994	Hi, I am desprate to work with WeightedDegreeRBFKernel but I can't figure its variables out. I went through its source code but it seems rather impossible to make a connection.
 blackburn	nona994: hi nona
 blackburn	nona994: what are your features?
 blackburn	nona994: weighted degree rbf works with dense real-valued features only
 nona994	can you please explain what is a dense real-valued feature. I guess it's a matrix right?
 blackburn	nona994: exactly
 blackburn	just dense matrix
 nona994	n by n matrix right?
 nona994	these are arguaments for wd RBF 'int32_t size: is cache size, float64_t w: is ???, int32_t d: is degree for wd kernel, int32_t nof_prop: ??'
 blackburn	nona994: no, n_features by n_vectors
 blackburn	nona994: w is width (in means of exponential parameter coefficient)
 blackburn	line 102 in .cpp
 blackburn	nof_prop - 'number of properties' but not sure what it means
 blackburn	I am afraid it is quite experimental
 blackburn	if sonney2k was here he could tell us
 nona994	I see How can I pass a dense features
 nona994	Yes sure,  he is the Oracle here
 blackburn	nona994: is that a question about dense features?
 nona994	yes
 nona994	no
 nona994	I mean since you said it works with dense features I want to know how can I pass this dens feature
 blackburn	I am confused
 blackburn	well if you have real valued features just use it
 blackburn	what is the data you are working with?
 nona994	I have protein sequences
 nona994	say they are strings
 blackburn	so you have no real-valued features I guess
 nona994	nop
 blackburn	then it looks quite impossible to use that kernel
 nona994	weighted degree (wd) works with strings and  wd rbf include some specific measurement (real value) for each character or in my case amino acid
 blackburn	in current implementation it just uses something similar to weighted degree kernel but for real values so I am unsure
 nona994	ok
 nona994	you are saying instead of strings it uses real-valued features and does the same computations and everything?
 blackburn	nona994: yes
 nona994	so if I initiate it with a real-valued matrix as TRAINing set it has to work
 nona994	what is the difference between line 24 and 31 why dense features have l and r?
 blackburn	nona994: treat it as rows and cols
 blackburn	nona994: say l has 5 features
 blackburn	err
 blackburn	5 vectors
 blackburn	and r has 3 vectors
 blackburn	then kernel matrix is 5 x 3
 nona994	you mean dense features is 5 x 3
 blackburn	nona994: no, matrix of kernel between l and r is 5 x 3
 nona994	i have got no idea about dense features :(
 blackburn	nona994: well images, etc
 blackburn	they are examples of dense features
 nona994	Are off to find them
 nona994	many thanks
 nona994	I am off to find them
