 shogun-buildbot	build #254 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/254  blamelist: tklein23 <tklein23@users.noreply.github.com>, Thoralf Klein <thoralf@fischlustig.de>
 thoralf	HeikoS1: I've got something for you.
 thoralf	Have a look on github.
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2159
 HeikoS1	thoralf: wow that sounds nasty
 HeikoS1	thoralf: I have to look into it tomorrow, currently doing something else, sorry
 thoralf	HeikoS1: No worries.  Just that you know there's something funny waiting for you. :)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: you always dig out interesting stuff! :)
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Most of the time it happens when I try to be productive...
 thoralf	... today I was just trying to fix buildbots memory issues ;)
 lisitsyn	ha!
 lisitsyn	I made d-ptrs 3x faster
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: thoralf: ^
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	:)
 lisitsyn	may be we can employ this later in shogun
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Make it another 2x and we're impressed. ;)
 lisitsyn	okay basic test is
 lisitsyn	a class and d-ptr with an int
 lisitsyn	method call just does i++;
 lisitsyn	here's what I got
 lisitsyn	my thing is
 lisitsyn	Average performance: 6316.20049 runs/s
 lisitsyn	and usual d-ptr is
 lisitsyn	Average performance: 2009.62692 runs/s
 lisitsyn	thoralf: you won't make me give up ;)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: I didn't even try. ;)

 HeikoS1	thoralf: solved, no need for the PR
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Hmm?
 HeikoS1	see my comment
 thoralf	You fixed it?
 thoralf	Ah.
 thoralf	HeikoS1: I tried what you just did... this will fail. ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: whats the problem?
 thoralf	Don't remember.  I think it was double-freeing in other classes.
 thoralf	But we'll see tomorrow.
 HeikoS1	but this removes the double ref-increase
 HeikoS1	if others fail, then they are doing things wrong.
 HeikoS1	haha, might be more of them than classes that do it correctly ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: did you see the subset stack stuff=?

 andrew__	hey all
 andrew__	I've been MIA for some weeks- extremely busy with school.
 andrew__	I would like to move forward ASAP with entrance tasks for GSOC if it isn't too late
 andrew__	really it would make things much easier on me if it could be taken on faith that I understand version control/github workflows and will know c++ when the time comes, but I understand the need to assess potential students

 andrew__	What is the status of issue #1889, which I had intended to work on before nikolis stepped in...
 andrew__	presumably there is benchmarking and testing to do?
 andrew__	anyway in lieu of leveraging the reputation of berkeley cs, the next 24 hours is when I'll have time to be doing entrance tasks so please let me know if anyone has ideas
 thoralf	andrew__: 24 hours from now?
 thoralf	This seems very spontaneous... ;)
 andrew__	yeah sorry... i've just been swamped and lo and behold the deadline is tomorrow...
 thoralf	andrew__: Did you already start any entrance task?
 thoralf	Is there pending an open one or have you already finished one?
 andrew__	not really. I decided a few weeks ago to take on #1889 and #1873.
 andrew__	Subsequently nikolis has apparently taken over 1889, which was a bit frustrating but so it goes I suppose
 andrew__	bedtime for me - I'll check the channel in the morning

 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: !
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn:  hi!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: we need to push kaggle thing ;)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: yep I know
 lisitsyn	it seems that we basically stopped once started
 HeikoS1	but first the other things that were on my list before :)
 HeikoS1	I still think about it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah sure
 HeikoS1	just some delay ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah that's how I work as well
 lisitsyn	I usually do things
 lisitsyn	but sometimes year after :D
 lisitsyn	you are better in this sense
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well anyway lets just be conscious :)
 HeikoS1	yeah
 lisitsyn	I mean kaggle is continuous stuff
 HeikoS1	I am excited about this
 lisitsyn	so if we can't make it
 HeikoS1	want to do it!
 HeikoS1	currently fixing a serious bug in CList
 HeikoS1	reference counting is done wrong
 HeikoS1	and people made workarounds against this
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: ok we need shared_ptr to stop this madness :D
 HeikoS1	so now lots of segfaults
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: write a design draft!
 HeikoS1	I would love this to stop
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I am trying to write up my thesis :D
 lisitsyn	one of the reasons why I am slow
 HeikoS1	ah I see
 HeikoS1	what is it about?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well I wanted to make inductive transfer
 lisitsyn	with dim reduction
 lisitsyn	just find some latent space of both source and target domains
 lisitsyn	and transfer a model somehow
 lisitsyn	I am already late to conduct any serious research on that so probably would be a shitty thing :D
 HeikoS1	haha

 lambday	HeikoS1: hi!
 lambday	HeikoS1: I have been trying for a while but I think the matrix ^2 thing can't be done if we can't store the matrix1!
 lambday	HeikoS1: in that case, if we plan to choose within block direct estimation, we're stuck with blocksize max 100k
-!- newlido [~quassel@41.218.175.187] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 HeikoS1	lambday: yes I think you are right
 HeikoS1	ill task to dino about that later today
 HeikoS1	but thats fine in fact
 HeikoS1	one can just use more blocks
 lambday	HeikoS1: I think we should give a warning if the blocksize is way too huge and the var estimation method is within block direct estimation one
 lambday	yes
 HeikoS1	lambday: yeah good idea, maybe even check for memory allocation errors
 HeikoS1	but anything over say 8GB should be warned about :)
 lambday	okay
 HeikoS1	lambday: I am currently trying to fix this bug that thoralf found
 HeikoS1	thats very tricky
 HeikoS1	touched something and now lots of things fail
 HeikoS1	but CList did wrong reference counting
 HeikoS1	so we have to do this :(
 HeikoS1	anf found some other errors on the fly

 darshanime	hello guys.
 darshanime	i am new here.
 darshanime	i am learning Machine Learning
 darshanime	I just wanted to know, when can I be ready to contribute ?
 darshanime	how do I know when i can do things ?
 darshanime	also what is the first step if I wish to do so?
 darshanime	should I fork the source code and try to decipher it from head to toe

 darshanime	okayy.
 pl8787_	such as svm or gp
 darshanime	right. then ?

 lambday	lisitsyn: you kicked yourself out?
@lisitsyn	lambday: yeah

@lisitsyn	lambday: kicked *other me * out
@lisitsyn	:)
 lambday	lisitsyn: multiple "me".. parallel universe :D
 lambday	multithreaded universe :-/
@lisitsyn	well forgot to turn off irc at job
 lambday	:D
@lisitsyn	I am lazy to set up any kind of remote desktop
@lisitsyn	lambday: while working on blog post as you ordered
@lisitsyn	I came with something else
@lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	lisitsyn: not ordered, my lord! humbly requested :D
@lisitsyn	hahah
 lambday	lisitsyn: sounds intriguing :D
@lisitsyn	lambday: okay imagine d pointer
 lambday	imagined!
@lisitsyn	but allocated in some buffer
@lisitsyn	so it is embedded to the class
@lisitsyn	buffer is not in heap but exactly in the class
 lambday	okay
@lisitsyn	like char storage[10]
@lisitsyn	lambday: guess the speedup ;)
 lambday	but limitations?
@lisitsyn	lambday: yes
 lambday	I mean, you're planning to do it on stack?
@lisitsyn	you provide exact size
@lisitsyn	no
@lisitsyn	main limitation - you provide exact size in declaration
@lisitsyn	so if you add new member and your 'implementation' class doesn't fit there anymore
 lambday	mmmh
@lisitsyn	you are doomed to alter declaration
@lisitsyn	it is not on stack but 'inside' of the class
@lisitsyn	where we provide d-ptr
 lambday	oh got it!
@lisitsyn	lambday: on some simple benchmark it was 3x faster
@lisitsyn	the benchmark is counter
@lisitsyn	each method call increases it
 lambday	counter of what?
@lisitsyn	lambday: well just int
@lisitsyn	we put an int to 'implementation'
@lisitsyn	and increase it
 lambday	lisitsyn: nono I mean it counts what?
@lisitsyn	nah nothing
@lisitsyn	just increases it :D
 lambday	oh you mean number of times a method is called in some fixed duration?
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	it is called a lot of times
 lambday	alrighty
@lisitsyn	so we have some estimate
@lisitsyn	how fast it is
 lambday	yeah!
 lambday	classico!
@lisitsyn	lambday: basically it is 50ns vs 12ns
@lisitsyn	per call
 lambday	whoa!
@lisitsyn	lambday: that's a matter of being cache-friendly
 lambday	yep...
 lambday	I had no idea that it fasten things up to this large factor!
@lisitsyn	lambday: let me find you another example
@lisitsyn	you'd like it
 lambday	alright
@lisitsyn	just a sec
@lisitsyn	lambday: http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html
 lambday	lisitsyn: checking..
@lisitsyn	lambday: it is pretty big so if tl;dr I can tell you about some speedup he mentioned there
 lambday	hmm... yeah I get the idea! but didn't think that the different can be this big!
@lisitsyn	lambday: yeah so basically he made things that he iterate anyway local
@lisitsyn	caching again
 lambday	lisitsyn: I am working on something - this encourages me to check/try out something here as well!
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah do that. Currently every<thing works
@lisitsyn	lambday: okie I need a hour to finish my post on these revisited d-ptrs ;)
 lambday	HeikoS: alrighty! hope to send PR for this sum thing by tonight!
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah! please let us know when you finish!
@lisitsyn	sure
@HeikoS	lambday: nice!
 lambday	lisitsyn: I am trying to check on some benchmark with some cache-friendly implementation for my task as well :D
@lisitsyn	lambday: you can actually measure cache misses
 lambday	really!

 lambday_	lisitsyn: why not?
 lambday_	1,008 bytes in 3 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 3 of 4 ==26711==    at 0x4A081D4: calloc (in /usr/lib64/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so) ==26711==    by 0x3049811C44: _dl_allocate_tls (dl-tls.c:296) ==26711==    by 0x304A408862: pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.2.5 (allocatestack.c:580) ==26711==    by 0x3BFAE08DD5: ???
