@wiking	arg
@wiking	i fucking hate grsec
@wiking	sonne|work: do we really need this?
 sonne|work	wiking: haha :)
@wiking	i cannot run any sane stuff on that machine
 sonne|work	it was the default
@wiking	now it's basically any sanitizer tool by google is not running at all
 sonne|work	do whatever you want. for me this is a throwaway scratch machine
@wiking	it's for sure some memory protection + address randomization shit
 sonne|work	we should back it up though once we are done setting it up
@wiking	but i couldn't find the way to disable it so that the tools starts to work
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so we can install the native kernel of debian?
 sonne|work	wiking: have you seen? buildbot kaboom action with everything failing? Could it be that we are running things twice on the new buildbot and it does some kind of massacre?
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea how though
 sonne|work	wiking: whatever you install will not be used IIRC
@wiking	because?
@wiking	we cannot have our own kernel?
@wiking	that would be really rediciolous
@wiking	well there's grub
@wiking	and grub.cfg

 sonne|work	wiking: sure I cannot help though
@wiking	that should be fine for us
@wiking	ok installing
@wiking	sonne|work: what happens if it doesn't boot up
@wiking	is there like a remote access thing for it?
 sonne|work	wiking: then I can do sth about it in the evening or tomorrow
@wiking	sonne|work: there's no remote access for that machine?
 sonne|work	no idea
@wiking	btw it's installed and grub.cfg setup
@wiking	i highly doubt that this kernel would not boot
 sonne|work	never needed it
@wiking	sonne|work: ovh.com?
 sonne|work	yes
@wiking	there is this
@wiking	http://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/reboot.xml
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'll reboot

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, I am thinking how LMNN could be speeded up when the feature dimension is large
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, this is the bottleneck right now: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/metric/LMNNImpl.cpp#L219
@iglesiasg	those for loops in there
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, they have to do a couple outer products with large vectors (the dx*dx.tranpose() part) each loop per iteration
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, and it seems that it gets costly
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, the Matlab code from LMNN's author does this computations in batch, instead of vector per vector. Have a look http://pastebin.com/S2m1BY4P
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, do you know if this kind of strategy would speed up computations made with Eigen?

 thoralf	iglesiasg: Looks funny to me, since dx*dxT would be a matrix.  Hope that dx is a row vector ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, dx*dxT is a matrix, yes
 thoralf	iglesiasg: But X.col() looks likt column vector?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Oh.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, outer product
 thoralf	iglesiasg: That's bad. :D
@iglesiasg	thoralf, hehe well it is the gradient of a matrix
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: in a minute
 foulwall	ping sonne|work
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, sure, no rush
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No way to tune O(n^2) to be less than O(n^2), since you at least need to read/write O(n^2) memory. ;)
 foulwall	ping van51
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: this is called rank update
@iglesiasg	thoralf, but you can make it faster of course
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: G must be symmetric, right?
 van51	hey foulwall
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, let me think of it
 foulwall	Hey van51 :)
 van51	foulwall: I'll probably need your help developing a language detection demo :)
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: G.selfadjointView<Upper>().rankUpdate(dx1, dx1);
 lisitsyn1	try that
 foulwall	Ok van51 , are there any existing examples on that?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, that should make it faster thatn making the product by hand?
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: yes I believe so
 van51	foulwall: in python specifically, right?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, I will try asap
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, thanks!
 foulwall	van51: sure
 van51	foulwall: if so, then not yet
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: but do not forget to not use raw G afterwards
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: use selfadjointView
 van51	foulwall: but still the model training takes some time so I think I will just be de-serializing it for the demo
 lisitsyn1	if it is not symmetric that won't work
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, aham I see
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, I have to make sure it is symmetric first then
 van51	foulwall: let me get a bit more into the framework and I'll bug you later with solid questions :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, I think you must be right and the matrix must be symmetric
 foulwall	van51: ok, just leave the js/css/html work to me.
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, since it is just composed of sums of outer products
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: if it is only rank updated
 lisitsyn1	then it is
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, I was checking its initialization to make sure of it. But yeah, outer products to initialize it as well
 van51	foulwall: ah if that's the case then I can tell you what I had in mind for the interface
 van51	foulwall: but if you have other stuff to do I 'll manage I think :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, but what about what you told me of not using it raw
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: it will be corrupted after that
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: only Upper or Lower (according to template parameter) part is stored
 foulwall	ok van51, I planed to do the demos for gsocers this week, so just leave it to me:)
 van51	foulwall: cool :D
 van51	foulwall: so all I have to do is the python handler in demos/ right?
 foulwall	van51: right
 foulwall	van51: :D
 van51	foulwall: do you want me to tell you anything about the input I'll be expecting or will wediscuss it at another time?
 foulwall	van51: language detection demo, is it a textbox and input some text and some arguments and the server do the detect and response with the result?
 foulwall	van51: like this http://nn.7nn.de:8000/ocr/entrance ? but with text input?
 van51	foulwall:  yes exactly :)
 foulwall	van51: That's easy to do, just tell me how to do the detect (or give me the ipynb) and that's all I need
@wiking	aaaaaaasdf

 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: second one is just kind of freelance and I am approaching all deadlines
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, aham I see. The video detection thing?
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: but it is CV, I believe need experience in CV
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, nice, I wish you good luck with it!

 lisitsyn1	wiking: have you already tried that -Os?
 lisitsyn1	or how it is called

 lisitsyn1	wiking: let me google
@wiking	yes
@wiking	lisitsyn1: according to gcc man
 lisitsyn1	wiking: -Og!
@wiking	-Os Optimize for size, but not at the expense of speed.
@wiking	mmm my gcc man doesn't have that flag :P

@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn1	if I said I'd like to reduce LoC to 50k
 lisitsyn1	:D
 lisitsyn1	well not that release
 lisitsyn1	just some random thought
@wiking	heheh
@wiking	have fun with it
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i would rather start getting rid of some custom created stuff
@wiking	like refCount
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yes
 lisitsyn1	wiking: that's a part of the great plan
 lisitsyn1	;)
 lisitsyn1	wiking: you can't get to 50k with custom stuff
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	but as of first
@wiking	we need to get all the static analyzer + valgrind + buildbot errors down to 0
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yes that's for this release
 lisitsyn1	I am talking about next one probably
@wiking	yeah otherwise
@wiking	yeah clear up shit
 lisitsyn1	I wouldn't suggest to do that now
@wiking	git flow feature start ThrowShitOut
@wiking	;)
 lisitsyn1	wiking: I had a chance to try my keywords lib in action

 sonne|osx	lisitsyn1: we are bigger than firefox will ever be
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: wiking: so my idea (that appeared from my needs)
 lisitsyn1	is to separate 'apply' module
 lisitsyn1	with no training
 lisitsyn1	and BSD/MIT it or whatever
 thoralf	250MB?  Do you have any traffic limitations? ;)
 sonne|osx	I didn't follow the discussion so no idea what is going on here
 sonne|osx	thoralf: no of course not :D
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: it started exactly when you joined the room
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Phew ;)
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: I mean the idea
 sonne|osx	thoralf: is the failure fixed or did it reappear?
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: see: now I have 1mb application
 lisitsyn1	I need machine learning there
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn1: use shogun for learning for applying write your own
 sonne|osx	that's what I do
 thoralf	sonne|osx: The only failure I could reproduced is about thread sanitizing.
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Which one did you see?
 sonne|osx	apply is usually 100LoC but the rest is waaah
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: but can't we have compact fast and non-gpl 'apply' module?
 thoralf	sonne|osx: MajorVote?

 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: 50K LoC or whatever
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn1: ??
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: we reduce to 100k or 50k next release
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn1: doing what?
 lisitsyn1	with same functionality
 thoralf	sonne|work: Btw., I observed something strange which might be a bug.  But I'm not sure what happens there... it's related to base/class_list.cpp
 thoralf	sonne|work: Sometimes the PT_COMPLEX64 are all "return NULL;", sometimes they're not.
 lisitsyn1	sonne|osx: reduce LoC with proper code
 thoralf	"case PT_COMPLEX64: return NULL;" vs. "case PT_COMPLEX64: return new CSparseFeatures<complex64_t>();"
 thoralf	sonne|osx: ^ I wrote it a few hours ago.  Any idea?

 thoralf	It's toggling on the same system.
 thoralf	No updates.
 thoralf	Doesn't yield to errors, but looks suspicious.

@wiking	intentional
 sonne|osx	thoralf, woking: ohh ok in that test there is indeed a expect_eq on floats and there is a mixture of float32 and 64 so that might explain it

 thoralf	iglesiasg: StructuredLabels::set_labels() does something different than the documentation tells
@iglesiasg	thoralf, let me check
 thoralf	iglesiasg: It inserts new labels
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Which means num_labels+=1
@iglesiasg	thoralf, StructuredLabels::set_label() you mean?
@iglesiasg	singular
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Yes, sorry.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, just to be sure of it :)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, mmm are you sure?
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsyn@fb2-lo1.global63.net] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Yes.  It inserts labels instead of substituting.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, mm ok, let me check insert_element in dynamic object array
 thoralf	iglesiasg: set_element() would be correct.
@wiking	lisitsyn: did u try: http://clang-omp.github.io/
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: no
 lisitsyn	wiking: should be in trunk soon, right?
@wiking	lisitsyn: apparently yes
@wiking	oh man wtf is this shiat
@wiking	now it's fPIC missing
@wiking	before it was that weird Scrt error
@iglesiasg	thoralf, yes, I think you are entirely right
@iglesiasg	thoralf, do you want to fix it?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Not yet.  set_element() doesn't do what I thought - how to replace an element?
 thoralf	I don't want to shift ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, you can use set_element and check the index given to set_label
@iglesiasg	thoralf, if it is out of the current number of labels, then raise error, otherwise set
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Sorry, off-by-one.  It's alright.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Will manage to replace an array element now. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, off-by-one?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Yeah, set_element(2) is off-by-one than set_element(1).  Explains why it didn't work :D
@iglesiasg	thoralf, aaah ok :)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, thank you for pointing the bug out. You are an expert on finding these things! Impressive
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I'd like to avoid. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, avoid bugs or avoid finding them? :P
 thoralf	iglesiasg: either :)
@iglesiasg	haha

@sonney2k	wiking, have you seen almost all buildslaves green
@sonney2k	only the FC* stuff and your static analysis not yet
@wiking	sonney2k: i've put a dependency for modular on static analysis
@wiking	but i dont understand why is it not fired
@wiking	ah ok i know
@wiking	since FC is failing
@wiking	but yeah static analysis will fail
@wiking	as there's like 100 errors that needs to be fixed :)

@sonney2k	wiking, but these are the only shogun ones right? The FC* bots are just buggy
@wiking	sonney2k: yesh fc19 modular has to be fixed
@wiking	but that means that i have to slice up the master.cfg
@wiking	as its already too hectic
@wiking	sonney2k: ah and we have tons of valgrind problesm ;)
@wiking	and i haven't even merged this: SerialUTest branch
@wiking	which will bring some other unit test down
@wiking	but i've tried to put together a thread analyzer bot
@wiking	but seems like an impossible mission with thread-sanitizer
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, but most of the valgrind things are wrong tests - mixing up array indices, setting up too short stuff, not initializing.
@wiking	thoralf: still .... needs to be fixed :)
 thoralf	wiking: Indeed.
@sonney2k	wiking, it is not earth shattering
@wiking	yeah i know
@sonney2k	this is quality wise much much better than previously
@sonney2k	and with that buildbotnet in the background things will continue to improve
@wiking	thoralf: so what did u use last time for thread analyzing? drd?
 thoralf	wiking: drd and helgrind, I think helgrind was more useful.
 thoralf	wiking: Detecting possible races.

@wiking	lisitsyn: http://pastebin.com/03U111vJ
@wiking	does this make any sense to u/
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: not really
@wiking	so it's a bug u say?
 lisitsyn	wiking: well that's just insertion to map
 lisitsyn	wiking: so it is just std::map
@wiking	yeah i get that
@wiking	well anyhow it was just a test... :)
 thoralf	Aargh.  Objections against removing CLabels::get_label_type() and labels/LabelTypes.h?
 thoralf	It's only used in LabelsFactory and almost useless when knowing dynamic_cast

@iglesiasg	wiking, ping
@wiking	iglesiasg: pong
@iglesiasg	wiking, what do you think about getting back static interfaces?
@iglesiasg	before release
@wiking	iglesiasg: they are back
@iglesiasg	fuck, I am always missing important stuff :'(
@wiking	nw
@wiking	ok i remember there was a discussion about properly init-ing class parameters... and registering
@wiking	what was the right order?
@iglesiasg	SG_ADD and assigning default values?
@wiking	i mean i have thi sclass and i know that there's somewthing wrong with init+register param
@wiking	but i dont know what

@iglesiasg	mm I think I normally SG_ADD and then initialize
@iglesiasg	but I thought it didn't make a difference
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/ensemble/WeightedMajorityVote.cpp#L21
@iglesiasg	wiking, yep. try the other way round maybe
@wiking	iglesiasg: same...
@iglesiasg	mm
@wiking	i mean i dont really know wtf is the problem... but
@iglesiasg	what's the error?
@wiking	since threadsanitizer is failing on this
@wiking	w/o real error

@iglesiasg	wiking, what about doing m_weights=SGVector<>() instead of the resize??
@iglesiasg	I guess it shouldn't make a difference but...
@wiking	the init fucks it up for sure

@wiking	woah man
@wiking	thread sanitizer actually FUCKING WORKS
@wiking	:DDDD
@wiking	thoralf: where r u? :)))
@iglesiasg	wiking, after the change to the constructor?
@wiking	yeah
@iglesiasg	cool
@wiking	iglesiasg: the problem is that errors are not being written at all
@iglesiasg	aham
@wiking	so it dies with an error
@wiking	but no mention about wtf is the error
@iglesiasg	wiking, aham
@iglesiasg	wiking, actually I think that SGVector and SGMatrix do not need to be initialized at all
@iglesiasg	default constructor is called automatically as they are objects and no primitive data type
@wiking	mmm the only thing i could think about
@wiking	that actually the errors are supressed
@wiking	by gtest
@wiking	i'd be very much interested why this error only comes up when threadsanitizer is running
@wiking	thoralf: if u r around would be great
