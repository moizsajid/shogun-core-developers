 sonne|work	blackburn: I've tried to fix the mkl xval example
 sonne|work	it is crashing when reading streaming features
 sonne|work	I know the reason why but I have no idea how to fix it
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah streaming is not in a good state
 sonne|work	well reason is sgvector now is auto referenced
 sonne|work	and that doesn't work with the way streaming is done
 blackburn	yeah I remember that thing
 sonne|work	I think we have to consider using row pointers there
 sonne|work	raw
 sonne|work	blackburn: could you please register at gsoc - melange site?
 blackburn	sonne|work: register mysefl? already did
 sonne|work	blackburn: I would rather now start workign on the proposal
 sonne|work	ahh cool
 sonne|work	what is your short name?
 blackburn	sonne|work: let me check
 blackburn	sonne|work: sergey_lisitsyn
 sonne|work	I will put you as backup admin
 sonne|work	(needed to register an org)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I know
 blackburn	sonne|work: I put some things to proposal before
 sonne|work	blackburn: where?
 blackburn	sonne|work: gdocs, shared with you
 blackburn	sonne|work: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LQTxhfuSPfmacuzXRh-N5Uvo91cp8Pf-OVmtd2IG8Q/edit?usp=sharing
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw olivier sent an abstract :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: forward it to me, I'll polish
 blackburn	sonne|work: what needs most care is 1) 2) and 4)
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonne|work : what is his project about?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hashing I think
 n4nd0	nvm I can see the google docs too
 sonne|work	n4nd0: the hashing trick, blackburn: I've put it in the ideas list
 n4nd0	ah no the google docs is other thing hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: ?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I thought the google docs was going to be the Olivier's abstract
 blackburn	sonne|work: what about putting a shogun mentor to each non-shogun mentor?
 sonne|work	blackburn: shogun mentor is you me heiko wiking?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'll co-mentor compressive sensing stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: can co-mentor LMNN by georg too
 blackburn	sonne|work: anything you'd like to co-mentor?
 n4nd0	blackburn: wiking could take a look to an hypothetical structured learning project, I think he knows about that stuff
 blackburn	let's put it as 'Shogun mentor'
 sonne|work	I am very familiar with d3js and the hashing trick
 blackburn	sonne|work: you familiar with d3js?
 blackburn	sonne|work: we should knew that :D
 sonne|work	some SO too sure
 blackburn	sonne|work: ICA?
 sonne|work	well blackburn ICA is close to PCA in some sense
 blackburn	sonne|work: and that means?
 sonne|work	(andreas would kill me for saying that)
 sonne|work	you should :)
 blackburn	alright
 sonne|work	I mean in the end it gives you a new basis (not necessarily fewer dims though)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'd put it in tapkee but not sure you'd like that :D
 sonne|work	in this sense it is different then :P
 blackburn	sonne|work: tapkee finally received t-SNE, one adapter and it would be in shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: *very* cool method for visualization
 blackburn	unbelievably intelligent comparing to other methods
 blackburn	which reminds me to put this task to entrance

 Yanglittle	.
 Yanglittle	I have a problem when installing shogun, I run ./configure,but it can't Matlab I've installed.
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: hey, so it doesn't recognize your matlab?
 Yanglittle	yeah.
 Yanglittle	any suggestions?
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: what is your matlab version?
 Yanglittle	R2012b
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: so you are giving the flag to compile for the interface matlab static?
 Yanglittle	I installed all interface  .
 n4nd0	ok
 Yanglittle	it can't run sg in matlab, so I run the instructions again ,and it says no matlab..
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: are you in linux?
 Yanglittle	yes, ubuntu 12.10
 n4nd0	what does matlab tell you if you execute this
 n4nd0	in your shell
 n4nd0	matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit'
 Yanglittle	K>> divide_by_std=false; K>> sg('add_preproc', 'PRUNEVARSUBMEAN', divide_by_std); Undefined function 'sg' for input arguments of type 'char'.
 n4nd0	mm that is weird
 n4nd0	I am trying to check if you can run matlab at all from command line
 n4nd0	I don't understand why does it appear any sg there
 Yanglittle	I don't understand..
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: mmm ok :)
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: so have you executed this: matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit' in your terminal?
 Yanglittle	I runned just now, it says no matlab command
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: ok, that's why it is not found by configure script
 n4nd0	you have to modify your path so matlab can be executed from terminal
 Yanglittle	ok  wait a moment
 n4nd0	or you could also add a link to your matlab executable in a directory of your path such as /usr/local/bin
 n4nd0	in any case I think this should be done automatically when you install matlab

 n4nd0	better
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: try ./configure --interfaces=matlab_static now
 Yanglittle	I can't make a soft link to matlab
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: why not?
 n4nd0	anyway if it is recognized now, it does not matter
 n4nd0	I guess maybe you are installing in a system without permissions?
 Yanglittle	still can't find matlab !!
 Yanglittle	Checking for libshogun ... yes (internal in source tree) Checking for Matlab ... no
 Yanglittle	it's boring, shoud I reinstall matlab ?
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: how did you install it?
 n4nd0	the configure script is looking for other things and if they are not found in the directories where they should be then it won't be recognized
 Yanglittle	I installed at the default position
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: ok let's check where it can be failing then
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: take a look to your configure.log file please
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: there should be a section with == Checking for Matlab ==
 n4nd0	and something should be said down there
 Yanglittle	============ Checking for Matlab ============ Result is: no
 n4nd0	hehe that's not very informative indeed :)
 Yanglittle	and then nothing .
 n4nd0	it looks to me like the configure script is still failing for you in matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit'
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: yeah just run matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit'
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: you told me it worked though
 Yanglittle	it can't find my matlab .
 sonne|work	on your cmdline
 sonne|work	n4nd0: oh you told him but still...
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: I think it might be that you added in a terminal window to your path a directory so matlab could be found
 n4nd0	and you are executing ./configure from another terminal
 Yanglittle	ok.
 n4nd0	sonne|work: btw the thing of the SGVector constructor for the modular interfaces that accepts an SGVector without const
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it is not working out so well
 Yanglittle	Checking for Posix thread spinlock support ... yes Checking for libshogun ... yes (internal in source tree) Checking for Readline support ... no Checking for Python numpy support ... 1.6.2 Checking for Python/Python Numpy Developer Files ... yes Checking for Octave ... no Checking for R ... no Checking for Matlab ... no Checking for Java ... not detected Checking for Mono C# ... not detected Checking for Ruby ... 1.9.3p194 Checki
 Yanglittle	no.
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: can you please check it you can run matlab from the same command line where you are running configure?
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: run matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit' in the exact same terminal you ran configure
 sonne|work	n4nd0: what happens?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the const was not the problem it seems, but the & - that it accepts an SGVector&
 Yanglittle	can't find matlab command
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: you have to make it find matlab and run configure from the same terminal window...
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: if you have changed your path you have to export that so the change is visible from all the system
 Yanglittle	when run matlab command,does it need to change the path?
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: no
 n4nd0	the matlab binary has to be visible from somewhere in the path
 Yanglittle	ok i'll check the system path
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: you said you get it work before from the command line right? to run matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r 'version;quit'
 Yanglittle	i changed the path to the matlab ,sorry.
 Yanglittle	so  it works  ~
 n4nd0	mm I don't really understand what you mean
 n4nd0	not sure if you changed the PATH env variable
 n4nd0	or cd to the matlab dir :)
 Yanglittle	it works well under matlab dir, but other  fails
 n4nd0	hehe sure
 n4nd0	do
 n4nd0	export PATH=$PATH:/your/matlab/dir
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes sure the & is the problem
 n4nd0	where /your/matlab/dir has to substituted for your actual dir
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I see, then the issue is that one cannot make a constructor SGVector(SGVector orig)
 sonne|work	why not?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I don't really know why TBH but the compiler tells me no way
 sonne|work	what does it say?
 n4nd0	../shogun/lib/SGVector.h:41:28: error: invalid constructor; you probably meant 'shogun::SGVector<T> (const shogun::SGVector<T>&)'
 n4nd0	I tried putting SGVector<T> too
 sonne|work	n4nd0: code?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: a second
 n4nd0	sonne|work: basically that: SGVector(SGVector<T> orig);
 Yanglittle	export PATH=$PATH:/your/matlab/dir    where to add?  i'm dizzy....
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it crashes when including the header from another file
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: you should execute that in your command line
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: However, it might be a good idea to do some reading first: take a look to this post to understand what you are doing http://askubuntu.com/questions/141718/what-is-path-environment-variable-and-how-to-add-it
 Yanglittle	I will  - -
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no that should work
 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm ok, I may be doing an stupid error
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: but just execute export PATH=$PATH:/your/matlab/dir from a command line
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: and try out that it worked by executing matlab from any dir
 sonne|work	n4nd0: show more code then :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the c++ code?
 sonne|work	yeah
 n4nd0	so this is the header
 n4nd0	SGVector(SGVector<T> orig);
 n4nd0	and this is the impl
 n4nd0	template<class T> SGVector<T>::SGVector(SGVector<T> orig) : SGReferencedData(orig)  {  copy_data(orig);  }
 n4nd0	but the compiler is not getting there, it stays in the header
 n4nd0	I am going to make clean and try again just in case..
-!- Yanglittle [deb20afd@gateway/web/freenode/ip.222.178.10.253] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 sonne|work	n4nd0: why do you do SGReferenceData(orig)? and why do you copy any data?
 sonne|work	maybe right though
 n4nd0	sonne|work: because it is the constructor
 n4nd0	I thought that was the right way :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: anyway, the error is still there
 n4nd0	I believe one cannot have a SGVector(const SGVector &orig) constructor
 n4nd0	and a SGVector(SGVector orig) one
 n4nd0	sonne|work: aaaaah look a reasonable answer
 n4nd0	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8436467/why-is-copy-constructor-not-allowed-pass-by-value
 sonne|work	n4nd0: hehe that makes sense
 n4nd0	:)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: maybe you implement a set() method then?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, I was thinking of that
 sonne|work	that could then just call the copy constructor
 sonne|work	and well we could enhance typemaps to also deal with & stuff
 sonne|work	(easy too)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the set method is easy
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I have checked the typemaps file and the SGVector_protocols
 n4nd0	that is a whole new world :)

-!- heiko [~heiko@nat-168-122.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	heiko: I've finally understood why the streaming stuff crashes
 sonne|work	which doesn't help me at all - it is non-trivial to fix :/
 sonne|work	reason is simply that sgvectors are used in there and back in the days we didn't have refcounting but these were just ptrs
 sonne|work	so kaboom
 sonne|work	your ass
 n4nd0	Larry Wall thing haha
 n4nd0	sonne|work: complete history http://james-iry.blogspot.se/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html :D
 sonne|work	n4nd0: seen the mailinglist?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yep
 sonne|work	why is this guy saying june?
 sonne|work	 July 12th!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: idk
 n4nd0	but let's host a second one in Stockholm :D
 sonne|work	just organize it :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: welcome to russia!
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100311130814/uncyclopedia/images/thumb/1/11/Welcome_to_russia.jpg/439px-Welcome_to_russia.jpg
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: lovely isn't it?
 n4nd0	indeed hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://imho.gazeta.spb.ru/f/a0/ru/auto/201102/x_256ae6aa.jpg
 blackburn	hah this one is better
 n4nd0	blackburn: who is the short one?
 blackburn	n4nd0: old president
 blackburn	and old new president
 blackburn	oh you know we have only two FOR EVER
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	yeah I recgonized Putin
 n4nd0	aah so they take turns??
 heiko	sonne|work: ok, well I reckoned that :?)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes 2 times of la poutine and one time of mjedwedjew and 2 times of la poutine
 blackburn	and so on
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	heiko: so it is no wonder that this all breaks. It needs a large refactoring
 blackburn	okay actually that was a last time and putin is forever
 blackburn	sonne|work: one more joke on perl
 heiko	sonne|work, yes, this is also non-trivial since sometimes he combines things in a strange way
 heiko	so one has to think when refactoring
 n4nd0	blackburn: the wat video, that one is awesome
 blackburn	perl is the only language which sources do not change after RSA encryption
 sonne|work	blackburn: *lol*
 heiko	sonne|work, btw at some point I tried to do this, but gave up after 1 day and did never commit
 blackburn	heiko: you were to commit suicide though I'd expect
 blackburn	refactoring that shit is tough
 blackburn	heiko: we need a great powerful lord of refactoring
 blackburn	the mighty specialist
 heiko	blackburn: yes, you exactly got it :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: heiko: so I offer that guy to visit hell?
 blackburn	err russia I mean
 heiko	blackburn: sonne|work problem is again that you dont notice when you break modules of the code, so tests would help there
 heiko	blackburn:  haha :)
 heiko	why do all the Russians tell people not to go to Russia? :D
 heiko	cant be that hellishj
 blackburn	heiko: oh well
 blackburn	heiko: one example - spring came and roads have vanished :D
 heiko	haha :)
 blackburn	dirt everywhere lol
 blackburn	heiko: do other russians tell you the same?
 heiko	blackburn: yes and polish people
 heiko	I have to been to Warsaw recently
 heiko	and a local guy told me
 heiko	Russia is a wild wild country - you should not go there
 blackburn	heiko: poland should be kinda heaven
 heiko	we should shoot it to the moon :)
 blackburn	comparing to russia
 blackburn	heiko: polish people are freaked out about russia though
 blackburn	heiko: so they are not whom to believe but believe me :D
 heiko	hehe ok :)
 heiko	blackburn:  I would really like to visit at some point
 blackburn	heiko: moscow should be ok
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn: yes!
 heiko	or st. petersburg
 blackburn	heiko: but not syzran or saransk
 heiko	I not even ever heard those names
 blackburn	heiko: well I have not known about heidelberg before yesterday
 blackburn	heiko: so that's normal
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	haha :)
 heiko	why have you heard about it?
 heiko	the famous neuroscientists from there fold you?
 blackburn	heiko: heidelberg?
 blackburn	heiko: georg zeller is located there
 blackburn	heiko: vapnik is originally from uzbekistan
 blackburn	heiko: that's hell
 blackburn	even more dangerous :D
 heiko	blackburn: well thats why he came up with large margins to keep stuff away :D
 blackburn	heiko: hahah
 blackburn	heiko: well when it was unite - USSR - it was ok
 blackburn	heiko: but now they don't like russians a little and as every european guy would look russian I'd not visit it
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	ok :)
 heiko	I dont really consider myself as Russian looking, but Ill stay away anyways
 blackburn	heiko: what is russian looking? we looks like other europeans mostly
 blackburn	look*
 heiko	blackburn: I would say no, its possible to spot them
 heiko	well, I dont know how you look like blackburn
 blackburn	heiko: yes but not really by looking but behaviour I think
 blackburn	heiko: see you in berlin :D
 heiko	indeed :)
 blackburn	heiko: sight is discriminative feature I think
 heiko	whatever
 heiko	;)
 blackburn	heiko: ah yes and russians never smile
 heiko	hehe
 blackburn	heiko: I bet you use it as a feature too
 blackburn	heiko: hmm this guy is moody
 blackburn	and classifier outputs 95%
 blackburn	of being russian
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	heiko: in moscow subway you could met some gentle and polite people that would say where should you go
 heiko	vapnik would like that
 blackburn	they could say who are you also
 blackburn	actually one could learn whole russian obscene dictionary being slow in subway
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	same here blackburn
 blackburn	heiko: oh then it is common
 blackburn	heiko: what do you think about forcing all algebra be written in eigen3?
 blackburn	for new code
 heiko	blackburn: good!
 heiko	blackburn: in particular, not use lapacl
 heiko	this api is a hell to debug
 heiko	and eigen3 got everything we need
 blackburn	heiko: lapack is better than loops
 heiko	I also tried many of their solvers
 heiko	that is good work
 blackburn	eigen3 is better than lapack
 blackburn	eigen4 is better than eigen3
 blackburn	but we get no eigen4 yet
 heiko	blackburn: how do the sparse impleentations work with shoguns sparese representation?
 blackburn	heiko: well would require copy..
 heiko	blackburn: I see, thats bad
 heiko	why is that?
 blackburn	heiko: well the same reason we copy from sgmatrix :)
 blackburn	heiko: if we made sgmatrix an adapter for eigen3 matrix and sgsparsematrix an adpater for eigen3 sparse matrix..
 blackburn	heiko: but copying sparse matrix is not a big issue, is it?
 heiko	blackburn: sparse=large so yet it is
 heiko	blackburn: well
 heiko	I guess not
 heiko	since solving systems with these matrices is much more significant in terms of costs
 heiko	as long as we dont copy in the most inner loop of something, should be fine
 blackburn	heiko: I don't get it - could you explain?
 heiko	blackburn: so you have a very large sparse matrix
 heiko	you copy it
 blackburn	heiko: is that a feature matrix?
 heiko	takes some time
 blackburn	heiko: 0.00001ms may be
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	covariance matrix for example
 heiko	now, you want to solve a system with the matrix
 heiko	takes much longer
 heiko	so copying is not a big thing in this case
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 heiko	(if the matrix is very large)
 blackburn	heiko: it is just a memory efficiency
 blackburn	heiko: I'd say solving is always slower than copying
 heiko	blackburn: yes
 heiko	blackburn: I am heavily using sparse matrices in matlab currently
 heiko	and matlab always copies
 blackburn	heiko: C++11 avoids some copies but in general copying happens all the time
 heiko	but what takes time are the solving operations
 blackburn	heiko: have you heard about rvalues btw?
 heiko	no
 blackburn	heiko: in C++ move semantics appeared
 blackburn	heiko: imagine you do method(get_parameter())
 blackburn	heiko: where get_parameter returns some class
 blackburn	heiko: in this case copy would be required
 blackburn	if you define method(class&&) - copying won't happen
 heiko	instead?
 blackburn	heiko: instead of const &
 heiko	whats the difference to a reference then?
 blackburn	heiko: temporary objects could be detected only with &&
 heiko	I see
 heiko	nice idea
 heiko	I  am not really following the c++ development
 heiko	too annoyed by the language :D
 blackburn	heiko: that's the language you write in ;)
 blackburn	heiko: language is awesome
 heiko	I know, just kidding :)
 blackburn	heiko: you just have to restict yourself
 blackburn	heiko: that's the difference with other langs
 blackburn	heiko: in C++ one should rather consruct some thing to work on top of
 heiko	blackburn: I tend to appreciate higher level languages more and more since my time seems to run lower and lower :)
 heiko	exactly
 blackburn	heiko: C++ is high-level
 heiko	blackburn:  I mean type free languages with memory managment and stuff
 heiko	like python (which I like a lot)
 heiko	but I also like c
 blackburn	heiko: types are necessary to write reliable code you like :)
 heiko	its just a difficult relationship :)
 heiko	I know
 heiko	I prefer C for backend stuff like shogun core
 heiko	blackburn: I should do some work, see you later today :)
 blackburn	heiko: I don't like writing loops so I can't say the same
 blackburn	alright
 n4nd0	sonne|work: have you seen this vid? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEgk1Hdze0
 n4nd0	hilarious
 blackburn	heiko: where do you plan to find that genius?
 blackburn	I am still scaried with your task :D
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: you said neither you nor sonne|work had all the reqs
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah

 sonne|work	make a backup of the libs
 sonne|work	and put the ones from usr system (in /lib and /usr/lib) there
 Yanglittle	i'm trying
 n4nd0	sonne|work, blackburn: another question about directors
 n4nd0	void set(const SGVector<T> orig);
 n4nd0	SGVector<T> create(const SGVector<T> orig);
 n4nd0	for the first method it is fine when I give it a numpy array
 n4nd0	but not for the second
 n4nd0	mmm forget about it the second method should be static.. and I have not done it
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the reason to pass const value here?
 n4nd0	blackburn: why not? It is not going to be changed inside
 n4nd0	better to const if possible I think
 n4nd0	and it works fine from python_modular for the method set
 Yanglittle	it seems to fail, I should install the older version of GCC.
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: mmmm I think it would be a bit weird if you actually need to do this
 blackburn	n4nd0: why not reference?
 n4nd0	blackburn: then it is a problem to do it from python for target interfaces
 blackburn	ahh thought so
 sonne|work	n4nd0: const with references make sense but this not so much
 n4nd0	sonne|work: why not?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: it is like writing void foo(const int a);
 n4nd0	I think that is fine
 blackburn	n4nd0: makes no sense :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh really?
 blackburn	n4nd0: in case of foo(const int a)
 blackburn	what is the differnce if you change it or not
 blackburn	it is stored in the stack anyway
 n4nd0	without const then you can make inside foo, a = 10 or whatever a equal to
 n4nd0	oh yes
 blackburn	yeah but this change won't change anything
 blackburn	if it was reference you could change value outside
 n4nd0	omg I am stupid
 blackburn	but this way you can't change anything anyway
 blackburn	no you are not :)
 n4nd0	a little bit at least I am :D
 blackburn	it is ok to write const here but that doesn't affect anything
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ok it protects you from changing 'a' inside of 'foo'
 n4nd0	indeed
 n4nd0	poor defensive programming
 sonne|work	heiko: yeah sure - question is what do we do now?
 sonne|work	most of the code uses streaming stuff only to read in simple ascii files from shogun
 sonne|work	so to get to stable we should somehow inactivate / blacklist the bad examples
 sonne|work	maybe implementing some ascii reader would be a good first workaround
 Yanglittle	... I can't solve the problem,aaaa.
 heiko	sonne|work: Well either we invest the time (probably it *is* solvable eventually) or not. As we are very short on this, i dont know. We already removed all the non-working examples. I think the best way would be to start from zero and try to make things work in little steps starting from the most basic functionality
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: library not found still?
 sonne|work	heiko: I don't talk about removing examples
 sonne|work	just to disable them
 sonne|work	heiko: and the streaming stuff is abused currently - no one actually really needs it so better have some simple reader for that file now
 sonne|work	and then fix the streaming correctly(tm)
 heiko	yes
 heiko	good plan
 heiko	btw for me remove=disable
 heiko	so we do not have a simple ascii file reader?
 heiko	I didnt even know that
 Yanglittle	so who can save me... - -
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: can you describe a little bit more what's going on please
 sonne|work	heiko: we have that actually!
 Yanglittle	sg('add_preproc', 'PRUNEVARSUBMEAN', divide_by_std); Invalid MEX-file '/home/liyang/MatlabWork/shogun-2.1.0/shogun-2.1.0/src/interfaces/matlab_static/sg.mexa64': /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012b/bin/glnxa64/../../sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so.13)   I tried the methods on google, but failed.
 Yanglittle	i trid to make a soft link to different libstdc++, failed.
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: but you removed the libstdc++ stuff from that dir before doing so right?
 Yanglittle	no.
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: please do: ldd usr/local/MATLAB/R2012b/bin/glnxa64/../../sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: then please move it to some backup dir
 n4nd0	I am off for a rest now, see you later

@sonney2k	blackburn, still awake?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's up?
 n4nd0	party time! :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what was your gsoc handle again
 blackburn	sonney2k: sergey_lisitsyn
@sonney2k	blackburn, OK I've submitted some dummy
 blackburn	sonney2k: is that better to early submit?
 blackburn	atgh what's with my word order
@sonney2k	blackburn, the sooner the better.
@sonney2k	we can incrementally improve all the time

 blackburn	sonney2k: yes but what is the reason to keep improves on melange?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is worrying me a lot is that we might not get down to 0 issues on the buildbot
 blackburn	sonney2k: due?
@sonney2k	blackburn, and we should somehow mention all the other gsoc events and have all the old ideas / stuff on the website
@sonney2k	etc
 blackburn	the wave?
@sonney2k	due before the wave in 2 weeks if we get accepted yes
 blackburn	I see, lets try to get rid of these issues next weeks then
@sonney2k	but recall that students started to look already now (the years before and this year too)
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	man I wish we had inf time
@sonney2k	then we could do some kaggle stuff and grow shogun with kaggle :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah that's what you should do instead of your job :)
 blackburn	but we didn't yet discovered how to get money automagically
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah sb has to beat the no free lunch theorem

 n4nd0	people, can you tell me if you can see the document without problem?
 n4nd0	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P9mCW_RvBP338GlNrOKAz8S98nnY_y5ugy4ZKiGF-Bo/edit?usp=sharing
 n4nd0	blackburn: ^
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please have a look at the website?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure, what do you want me to look at?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ahh my bad did sth wrong
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham I see
 n4nd0	we want a GSoC level
@sonney2k	blackburn, I've added http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2011 and http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012
 n4nd0	and GSoC 201x below
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but then we cannot have multiple pages for a gsoc
@sonney2k	I think we should have a)
@sonney2k	ideas list
@sonney2k	b) announcement that we particiapte
 n4nd0	yeah then we wouldn't be able
@sonney2k	c) summary
 n4nd0	I understand
 n4nd0	what about an old level
@sonney2k	I need to copy that stuff from the old website
 n4nd0	and we put GSoC 2012 and GSoC 2011 inside
 n4nd0	or would you like to have inner levels in those GSoCs too?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, is it so bad to have some content on the website?
@sonney2k	yes
 n4nd0	then it is fine as it is
@sonney2k	I want to copy this stuff from my blog
@sonney2k	blackburn, we can also use that style
@sonney2k	I need to copy a bit of .css for that to look nice though
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I would also copy the europython2010 / whatever conference we talked about shogun stuff there
 n4nd0	it makes sense yeah
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah we still haven't moved all content from the old website to the new layout
@sonney2k	it is about time to do that
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do you recall this nice 'feature matrix' we had
@sonney2k	where we compared lots of ml toolboxes?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	that should come back...
 n4nd0	I guess it is easy to draw a table in django
@sonney2k	I had this python script that generates it from the google doc
@sonney2k	somewhere...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please move this gsoc information over http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/information to gsoc2012
-!- zxtx [~zv@c-67-188-178-73.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	both the 2013 and the 2012 should be moved
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will edit it now
 n4nd0	we have to improve the style of some of the articles... they look a bit ugly :S
@sonney2k	yes do what you can :)
