 OXPHOS	wiking: hey! for the serialization, I split the enum into container types and primitive types. But i didn
 OXPHOS	t find a way Heiko mentioned that didn't have to list all possible combinations

 OXPHOS	HeikoS: hey! I split the enum into container types and primitive types. But i have to go through all container-primitive combinations. I didn't find a good way to avoid that
@HeikoS	hi
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: update: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c
@HeikoS	where do you have to go through that?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so these here
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L63
@HeikoS	are not what I meant
@HeikoS	primitive type should not have SGVECTOR anymore
@HeikoS	as that is already dealt with in container typoe
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: oh i forgot to remove them
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: i mean during the save, I have to do ar(*(reinterpret_cast<SGVector<primitivetype>*>(storage)))
 OXPHOS	kind of stuff
@HeikoS	line?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: method from line331
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L333
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: They're commented out because I was testing different methods but none worked
@HeikoS	I dont understand the problem
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: so it's supposed to be sth. like this, with ContainerType and PrimitiveType
@HeikoS	sth. like what?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L49
 OXPHOS	right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	thats exactly what I meant
@HeikoS	rather than storing all the combinations, store them only for container and primitive
 OXPHOS	and in the save, we have rules for primitive types, and the most ideal (easiest) way is what I had in Line337-360
 OXPHOS	https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L337
 OXPHOS	we process primitive types and generate a general rule
 OXPHOS	and apply it to the container types
 OXPHOS	so we don't have to go through every single container<primitive> combination
 OXPHOS	HeikoS^
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	yes exactly
 OXPHOS	I didn't find a way to do it..
@HeikoS	so only go through all primitive types and container types once each
 OXPHOS	because there's a cast step reinterpret_cast<container<primitive type>*>(storage)
@HeikoS	I think you will need some function
@HeikoS	that turns the two enums into the type you want
@HeikoS	but not sure still what is the problem
 OXPHOS	turns the two enums into the type
 OXPHOS	I can only think of typedef
 OXPHOS	which is not very friendly
@HeikoS	mnmmmh
 OXPHOS	I am currently having a helper struct defined in https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L101
 OXPHOS	trying to enable the redefinition of typedef
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: maybe if it is too much hassle, leave it for now
@HeikoS	and do the combinations explicitly
@HeikoS	we can ask lambday later
@HeikoS	he knows more about this that I do
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: np
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: btw re the API
@HeikoS	we want the same interface as save_serializable
@HeikoS	CSGOBject::save_serializable that is
@HeikoS	i.e. it either takes a file object
@HeikoS	or a filename
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	filename and enum for filetype would be ok here I guess
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: the thing is this should work from SWIG
@HeikoS	we can have these other methods internally, but the Archive is not typemapped, so we cannot pass it through the modular interfaces
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure. so the key is wrapping the serialization with filename and enum for filetype arguments
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: also the ViennaCL rowwise sum uses ocl kernel. Should I do that or leave it unimplemented for now?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: yes wrapping exactly, it is just some convenience method for SWIG users
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: why not?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: okay i ll do it
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: once you mentioned it might be slow but maybe for that particular purpose
@HeikoS	slow?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ah Isee
@HeikoS	another discussion for lambday
@HeikoS	I think it is a bit weird to compile a kernel on the fly
@HeikoS	since it takes time

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: jojo
@HeikoS	lambday: jo! OXPHOS had some questions
@lambday	HeikoS: yo
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: yo
@lambday	OXPHOS: hey!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: just saw the update
@HeikoS	so you use omp now
 Saurabh7	oh that, yes just trying it
 OXPHOS	lambday: hey! yes! kinda hard to describe..
@HeikoS	makes code quite a bit easier I guess
 Saurabh7	doesnt break anything on local
@lambday	OXPHOS: give it a shot!
@HeikoS	at the cost of not being able to stop it, but I think that should be ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: needs unit test!
 OXPHOS	lambday: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L49
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: what about liblinear?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: so how did the pthread one stop, i dont get it
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: one can stop pthreads
@HeikoS	with CSignal
 OXPHOS	lambday: I am trying to combine the two enums into one type
 OXPHOS	lambday: the final step would be reinterpret_cast<container<primitive type>*>(storage), where container comes from CT_* and primitive type comes from PT_*
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: Liblinear I made changes, looks like everyhting is ok
@HeikoS	is it mergable already?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: is it faster?
@lambday	OXPHOS: what are you trying to achieve here?
@lambday	OXPHOS: can you just explain very briefly?
 Saurabh7	yep, I will add that benchmark
 OXPHOS	lambday: I am archiving any, which needs reinterpret_cast<>()
@lambday	OXPHOS: I see!..
 OXPHOS	lambday: and for each container type, like sgvector, it can take many primitive type like <typename T>
 OXPHOS	lambday: Ideally I don't have to list them all
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: commented a bit more on the PR
@HeikoS	lambday: ill come in now, can explain
@HeikoS	see you soon

@lambday	OXPHOS: so enum is the way to go for that?
 OXPHOS	lambday: so far yes..I didn't come up with other way
@lambday	OXPHOS: why differentiate between PT_INT32 and PT_SGVECTOR_INT32? https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L62
 OXPHOS	lambday: yeah PT_SGVECTOR_INT32 should be removed..
@lambday	so basically what you need is to create a trait that, when given the container type and the primitive type, gives you the actual type
 OXPHOS	yes!
@lambday	OXPHOS: ok I got the scenario.. now what is the question :D
@lambday	the trait doesn't work?
 OXPHOS	lambday: it didn't work..I was trying to wrap a typedef in a struct
 OXPHOS	lambday: typedef doesn't seem to work at all..but I can't come up with other way to store type
@lambday	OXPHOS: that's valid
@lambday	typedef/using both should work
@lambday	OXPHOS: what seems to be the error?
 OXPHOS	lambday: oh in one approach I need to redefine the same `typedef` so container can take the same variable regardless of the real primitive type, which didn't work.
 OXPHOS	lambday: and now I redefined it in struct, but I cannot use it from the Any class (save method)
 OXPHOS	because it's not const
 OXPHOS	lambday: like this: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/406213621fc9983478336bd2459c769c#file-any-h-L333
@lambday	OXPHOS: yeah template args don't work if they aren't constexpr
 OXPHOS	lambday: yeah..kinda stuck here
@lambday	OXPHOS: I am not sure I get the problem right.. so where do you need to redefine same `typedef`
 OXPHOS	lambday: or whatever method that can work...my original idea was
 OXPHOS	switch (m_datatype.e_primitivetype) { case serial::EnumPrimitiveType::PT_INT_32:typedef int32_t primitivetype; break; case...
 OXPHOS	so for switch (m_datatype.e_containertype)
 OXPHOS	I can call ar(*(reinterpret_cast<primitivetype*>(storage))); break;
 OXPHOS	for whatever primitive type
 OXPHOS	as they're all typedef-ed as primitivetype
@lambday	OXPHOS: yeah it it's not constexpr, that's the only way you can deal with it AFAIK
@lambday	yeah it cannot be constexpr in this case, cause it's setting via a template function in DataType
@lambday	OXPHOS: can the
@lambday	OXPHOS: can the policy itself deal with this?
 OXPHOS	lambday: I don't think so..the type is converted to string. so it can compare whether two types are the same. but kinda hard to map back to type
 OXPHOS	also it stores: int, double, shogun::sgvector<int>
 OXPHOS	some info are missing
@lambday	OXPHOS: oh select_policy<T> returns a base-ptr so the type-info is gone.. I see
@lambday	yeah you need enums
@lambday	and in that case, switch-case is the option that comes to mind
@lambday	but wait.. you cannot do typedef int32_t primitive_type in case scope I assume
@lambday	OXPHOS: so here's what I'd do.. write a template function for the actual *cereal_save*.. and from the wrapper, I call that function inside switch case
 OXPHOS	lambday: I didn't get it..
 OXPHOS	lambday: typedef is global. I can't do it case wisely
@lambday	OXPHOS: ok let me try something
@lambday	OXPHOS: there?
@lambday	OXPHOS: sorry I couldn't think of anything better than this - https://gist.github.com/lambday/5db9d29431315fbf5df00bcdd865c061
 OXPHOS	lambday: hey thanks!
 OXPHOS	lambday: yeah...I think in this way we have to list out every combination..
