 sanuj	lisitsyn: there?
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	hi
 sanuj	i forgot to ask you yesterday
 sanuj	this gives error
 sanuj	unordered_map<Tag, Any> tag_map;
 sanuj	because Tag is a template
 sanuj	class
 sanuj	lisitsyn: ^

 sanuj	lisitsyn: i did something like
 lisitsyn	ok sorry, I'm back
 sanuj	template <typename T>
 sanuj	struct Hash { unordered_map<Tag<T>, Any> tag_map; };
 lisitsyn	yes you can't store tag in the map
 sanuj	lisitsyn: and to save a value in map
 sanuj	Hash<T>::tag_map[tag] = value;
 lisitsyn	no this won't work
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	it compiled :P
 sanuj	just experimenting
 lisitsyn	I mean you can't assume all of parameters are of that T type
 sanuj	what do you suggest
 lisitsyn	store tag name in the map as the key
 sanuj	how will type checking happen with tag if key is a string
 lisitsyn	on cast of any
 sanuj	lisitsyn: okay
 sanuj	makes sense
 lisitsyn	tag_map[tag.name()].as<T>();
 sanuj	lisitsyn: now things make sense :)
 sanuj	lisitsyn: did you hear about stochastic depth?
 lisitsyn	yeah

 sanuj	HeikoS: hi :)
 sanuj	can you merge this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3147
@HeikoS	sanuj: hi there
 sanuj	i think error is not related
@HeikoS	sanuj: yeah it is not
@HeikoS	I gave my ok
@HeikoS	but want wiking to have a look
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool

 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yo
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi there!
 Saurabh7	I was wondering if its worth it to make eigen calls after linalg calls eveytime
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: no no
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, like you mentiion here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/69f1f2e17d14863e70129077bba2e390cdddc8d1
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: we will soon allow for linalg to be available always
@HeikoS	so for now, I just want to make sure the build works and that KMeans works if linalg is not available (as before your patches)
 Saurabh7	i had guarded the whole call though
 Saurabh7	so its should work i think
@HeikoS	but after the next release (before GSoC starts), we will make c++11 a hard dependency and then linalg is alsways there
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: no, the buildbot build without linalg failed
 Saurabh7	hmm ok i will look i think i missed something
@HeikoS	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/precise%20-%20libshogun/builds/1190
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'precise - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 14m48s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: this is a very old ubuntu without c++11 and therefore without linalg
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok i understand i did it wrong my bad
 Saurabh7	 should guard that method itself
@HeikoS	we should have spotted it before merging
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: if you want kmeans to continue to work, you need to provide an alternative
@HeikoS	but as said, we will be able to use linalg everywhere soon to avoid such redundant codes
 Saurabh7	yes i had plan it to skip kmeans++ and use random init but messed it up a bit
 Saurabh7	yup linalg everwhere is good

 sanuj	lisitsyn: everything is compiling but i'm getting segment faults while testing

 sanuj	lisitsyn: I'm storing value like ^

 sanuj	c++ memory confuses me :/
 lisitsyn	:) you've got to learn valgrind
 sanuj	lisitsyn: okay
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	wiking: can you merge this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3147 :)
