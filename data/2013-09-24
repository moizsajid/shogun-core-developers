 besser82	Hello Folks!
 besser82	One small question:  May I use some of the screenshots on your website for composing a logo for my newly founded "Fedora Machine Learnng SIG"?
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking, HeikoS, iglesiasg: ^^
@HeikoS	besser82: which one do you have in mind? We have a logo.
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah Fedora ML! :) +1
 besser82	HeikoS: not as a logo for shogun :)
 besser82	HeikoS: I need some artwork for SIG's wiki  ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah sure, go ahead, at least from my side. We can also produce some vector graphics for ya
 besser82	HeikoS: That would be really nice of you, thanks a lot :D
@HeikoS	besser82: let me know what you need
 besser82	HeikoS: some stuff like shown here:  http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/figures/MatlabDemo.png
 besser82	http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/figures/PythonDemo.png
 besser82	http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/figures/RDemo.png
 besser82	HeikoS: ^^  thanks again  ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: I see, maybe looking at a few of the notebooks will help. I am currently doing nice graphics for the GP one
@HeikoS	besser82: I am currently in holiday, but will do once back
@iglesiasg	besser82, cool initiative for Fedora
 besser82	HeikoS: no need to hurry :)
 besser82	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/ML
 besser82	HeikoS, iglesiasg:  ^^
 besser82	iglesiasg: thanks!
@HeikoS	besser82: nice! Shogun will dominate them all ;)
@iglesiasg	haha
 besser82	HeikoS, iglesiasg, sonne|work: btw. if you need anything please let me know.
 besser82	HeikoS, iglesiasg, sonne|work: Thinking about Cloud-appliances and other infra stuff ;)
 besser82	HeikoS, iglesiasg, sonne|work: redhat pays the $  :D
@iglesiasg	besser82, what are you thinking about cloud applications?
 besser82	iglesiasg: Thinking about if you need one for shogun....
@iglesiasg	besser82, ahhh, all right. Got it
@HeikoS	besser82: we are experimenting with cloud stuff
@iglesiasg	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo :-O
@HeikoS	besser82: we have an internal ipython notebook server with shogun, to which you can connect from any browser
@iglesiasg	I am scared, I never thought I'd find something like this studying sorting algorithms
 besser82	HeikoS: sounds great! any url to this?  If you need some more power for it, just let me know ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: mostly manpower ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: I can always get some stuff from fedora-infra  ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: Even man-power if needed ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: In fact, I am thinking of maybe finding sponsors for this, to pay hardware or developers, we cannot handle that currently
 besser82	HeikoS:  What exactly do you need?
 lisitsyn	besser82: you are good at selling things :)
@HeikoS	besser82:  ideas, people who want to push these ideas, etc
@HeikoS	besser82: I would love to have a shogun webservice
@HeikoS	where people could try shogun
@HeikoS	since most scientists fail installing it
 besser82	HeikoS:  We can setup such a service on fedora-infra ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: that would be amazing, in fact, we should talk about this in more detail after the release (which is more important now)
 besser82	HeikoS: Sure ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: but really would like to push things, if you are in, that is great!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so you say you can't participate this week?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah sorry
@HeikoS	busy surfing ;)
 lisitsyn	I don't mind next week then
 lisitsyn	I can send next week doodle
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I would prefer, also I would prefer if we dont rush the release as usual
@HeikoS	but take some time
 besser82	HeikoS: I'm in!  Let me talk to Kevin Fenzi (fedora-infra master-mind) to get things going :)
@HeikoS	besser82: awesome! Ill get back to you next week and after release
 besser82	lisitsyn: Thanks!  Selling stuff was my job for ~7 yrs.  :D
 besser82	HeikoS: Sure.  Just ping me  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha I see
 lisitsyn	besser82: it seeems fedora has community
 lisitsyn	I don't see any community around ubuntu
 besser82	lisitsyn: Fedora LIVES from community  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: basically everything is driven by volunteers  :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure, there are redhat folks, but they are minor
 besser82	lisitsyn: Canonical just wants to squeeze the $ out of *buntu  :(
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is ok to squeeze $ I believe
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure, redhat does, too.  But gives back to community
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah that's a good point
 lisitsyn	canonical gets some money and spends it hmm
 lisitsyn	I don't know how
 besser82	lisitsyn: Canonical get some $, but mosty givee it to Mark Shuttleworth :(
 lisitsyn	well they are started to develop their own things
 lisitsyn	like Mir or whatever it is called
 sonne|work	gsomix: all good with sparse? progressing?
 besser82	lisitsyn: redhat does, too. but always makes sure there is FOSS alternative
 besser82	lisitsyn: like openShift ---> openShiftOrigins
 besser82	lisitsyn: like RHEV ---> oVirt
 besser82	lisitsyn: same stuff as in RHEL but FOSS  ;)
 gsomix	sonne|work, step by step. but today I'm a little busy. I think I can make PR today at night.
 sonne|work	try hard... I have to submit the evaluation soon
 gsomix	sonne|work, ok!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, btw!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I haven't heard from Georg for a few days, I guess he must be busy. Would it be a problem for you to complete the evaluation in case he cannot make it?
@iglesiasg	I will ping him about it in any case tomorrow
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no sure
 lisitsyn	I can submit
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, thanks!
@iglesiasg	I will mail him tom and CC you then
 gsomix	sonne|work, btw tomorrow is fully free.
@HeikoS	iglesiasg, sonne|work, lisitsyn, wiking, besser82, http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6685990      :)  Roman will add some things soon hopefully, he is working on a real life example
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: good!
