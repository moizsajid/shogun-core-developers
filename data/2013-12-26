 siddharth950	Hi, I have installed shogun from source
 siddharth950	I saw a previous IRC log where doing 'sudo ldconfig' worked while executing the compiled program
 siddharth950	is there a way to get around this problem?
 besser82	siddharth950: on which OS / distro?
 siddharth950	Ubuntu 12.04
 besser82	siddharth950: and what is your concrete problem?  The lib isn't found?

 siddharth950	sorry about that
 besser82	siddharth950: and what is your concrete problem?  The lib isn't found?
 siddharth950	bad internet connection
 siddharth950	yes, I get this error
 siddharth950	ImportError: libshogun.so.14: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
@sonney2k	heya goad eve'
 besser82	siddharth950: and libshogun is installed in /usr/lib, right?
 besser82	sonney2k: Hey!
 siddharth950	yes, I think so, because I used 'make install'
@sonney2k	besser82, lego's finished?
 besser82	sonney2k: yes, all lego stuff is build for the kidz  :D
 besser82	sonney2k: I think the whole LEGO Friends(tm) City is complete now
 besser82	siddharth950: then it should be there, but the linker doesn't find it?
@sonney2k	besser82, we have some new notebooks now :) http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/KNN.html http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/naive_bayes.html  http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/multiclass_reduction.html
 siddharth950	that's right, the program compiles fine, but gives that linker error while executing
@sonney2k	Admittedly, I am totally in the notebook and release mode
@sonney2k	besser82, shall I release or wait for you?
 besser82	sonney2k: sweet!  I just updated the fedora-rpms
 besser82	sonney2k: If it would be ok for you to wait ~2 days...
@sonney2k	besser82, I have to do the release before end of holidays
@sonney2k	so yes I can wait that much but I am pretty sure I will be /dev/null once back to work
 besser82	siddharth950: in fact running `sudo /sbin/ldconfig` once should fix it....
 besser82	siddharth950: the other option would be to explicity link you code with rpath, like -Wl,-l /usr/lib/libshogun.so.15
 siddharth950	okay, so I took the first option
 siddharth950	one more thing
 besser82	siddharth950: yes
 siddharth950	when I run the program, I get a segmentation fault
 siddharth950	this is the first minimal program I'mtalking about
 siddharth950	but when I run it as 'sudo ./a.out' there's no problem
 besser82	siddharth950: where does the segfault come from?
 siddharth950	besser82, no idea, I just tried running it as root, it works fine that way
 besser82	siddharth950:  looks like some problems with permissions then...
 besser82	siddharth950:  try `valgrind --track-origins=yes --log valgrind.log $your_prob` and paste the log please...
 siddharth950	I'm sorry, but I didn't get this
 siddharth950	where am I supposed to do this?
 besser82	siddharth950:   on the command-line;  just like invoking your program
 besser82	siddharth950:  valgrind --track-origins=yes --log valgrind.log ./a.out
 siddharth950	okay, one sec
 besser82	siddharth950:  and you can paste the log e.g. on fpaste.org
 siddharth950	besser82, installing valgrind
 besser82	siddharth950:  kk
 siddharth950	besser82, valgrind: valgrind.log: command not found
 besser82	siddharth950:  valgrind --track-origins=yes --log valgrind.log ./a.out
 besser82	siddharth950:  should work
 besser82	siddharth950:  otherwise try:
 besser82	siddharth950:  valgrind --track-origins=yes ./a.out > valgrind.log 2>&1
 siddharth950	besser82, yes, this worked
 besser82	siddharth950:  fine ;)
 besser82	siddharth950:  now you need to open the file in your favourite editor, copy && paste it to fpaste.org and give me the link  ;)
 siddharth950	besser82, do I need to create an account on fpaste?
 besser82	siddharth950:  nope,  free to use
 besser82	siddharth950:  just open the page, paste and submit ;)
 siddharth950	http://fpaste.org/64439/38808823/
 siddharth950	password is your username
 besser82	siddharth950:  Thanks!  The problem is the permissions on the input files read by shogun::init_shogun
 besser82	siddharth950:  Your code segfaults, because your "normal" user hasn't sufficient permissions on them
 besser82	siddharth950:  like 0644 perms and owned by root  ;)
 besser82	siddharth950:  you should fix that in filesystem
 siddharth950	besser82, will reinstalling from source fix it?
 siddharth950	besser82, how do I solve it?
 besser82	siddharth950: not realy
 besser82	siddharth950: you are opening some files for input / output in shogun, right?
 besser82	siddharth950: you should make sure, that the local user is able to have access to them...
 besser82	siddharth950: could you please paste your code of a.out?
 siddharth950	#include <shogun/base/init.h>
 siddharth950	using namespace shogun;
 siddharth950	int main(int argc, char** argv)
 siddharth950	{
 siddharth950	    init_shogun();
 siddharth950	    exit_shogun();
 siddharth950	    return 0;
 siddharth950	}
 besser82	siddharth950: kk, and which files are in your pwd?
 bb	besser82 hi how have you been
 besser82	bb: I'm fine thanks!  And yourself?  Hada merry X-Mas?
 siddharth950	besser82, the code file, a.out and the valgrind log
 bb	besser82 fine too. i do not celebrate x-mas.. but had a nice day as it was holiday!
 besser82	siddharth950: mhhh....  is your user able to read from /dev/urandom  ????
 besser82	siddharth950: like `head /dev/urandom`
 besser82	bb: nice to hear  ;)
 siddharth950	besser82, yes, lot of weird characters on the screen
 besser82	bb: What do you celebrate instead?
 besser82	siddharth950: mhhh....  now it gets tough....
 siddharth950	besser82, lol
 besser82	siddharth950: lemme try to reproduce....
 bb	besser82 i am not religious just celebrate holidays
 siddharth950	besser82, okay
 besser82	bb:  OK, that's an explanaition  ;)
 bb	besser82 shogun is not able to detect gdb during cmake even though its in my path
 bb	is it looking for something specific
 besser82	bb: gdb isn't really need for common use  ;)
 besser82	bb: It's just needed for special test during development, like coverage || memchecks
 besser82	siddharth950: I cannot reproduce this on my machine  :(
 besser82	siddharth950: took your code, ran it thorugh g++ and all runs fine; no segfaults  :(
 bb	besser82 ok.. but any reason not able to find? also do you know but this OpenMP library
 besser82	bb: I dunno...   What's about that openMP?
 besser82	bb: ahhh...  AFAIK:  clang doesn't support openMP, yet....
 besser82	bb: You building on a Mac, rye?
 siddharth950	besser82, okay, I will try some things tomorrow
 bb	besser82 i tried installing that and could not make it work .. yes http://clang-omp.github.io/ followed that guide
 siddharth950	besser82, it's getting late here
 siddharth950	besser82, will you be here tomorrow?
 besser82	siddharth950: Sure!  You will se me here nearly everyday  ;)
 besser82	siddharth950: Have a good night
 siddharth950	besser82, okay, thanks for the help :)
 besser82	siddharth950: np.  :)  You're Welcome  :D

 besser82	bb: clang actually isn't my topic, too  :(
 bb	besser82 dont know if any body has tried it..
 besser82	bb: possibly sonney2k or wiking
 bb	besser82 sure i will check with them
 besser82	bb: allrighty!  ;)
 bb	wiking sonney2k have you tried openmp with clang http://clang-omp.github.io/ it did not work for me... any suggestions ideas
 bb	besser82 how was your christmas
 besser82	bb: quite nice, thanks for asking
 besser82	bb: much fun with the kids and building LEGO for ages  ;)
 bb	besser82 thats good!
* besser82 is off to bed then...
 besser82	bb: have a nice day  ;)  C u somewhen later  ;)
@sonney2k	bb, I am all gcc/g++ here
 bb	besser82 you too..
 bb	sonney2k okay so you are not using clang at all..
 bb	sonney2k any one who could help..
 besser82	bb: then only wiking is left....
 bb	besser82 okay i will wait on him.. when he gets a chance
 besser82	bb: kk  ;)
 besser82	bb: I just thought sonney2k might have a mac, too...
 besser82	bb: but in fact he doesn't...
 bb	sonney2k he is but does not use the native compiler on mac but instead uses gnu c/c++
@sonney2k	besser82, I do but I prefer doing real work under linux :D
@sonney2k	guys we own sgtb.eu now :)
@sonney2k	so lets do some proper documentation redirects...
@sonney2k	and sigh I should transfer some other domains...
 besser82	sonney2k: +1 for linux  :D
 bb	sonney2k did you mean prefer or "not prefer"
@sonney2k	bb prefer :)
@sonney2k	bb, it is just soo much easier to do stuff under linux
 bb	sonney2k yes i understand..
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: like ShoGunToolBox?
 lisitsyn	:)
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I did this for quick docu links like : sgtb.eu/CSVM
@sonney2k	current trying to get this to work
 lisitsyn	hah
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: don't you think there should be some stuff for that?
 lisitsyn	like generic
 lisitsyn	I haven't seen anything so far
@sonney2k	it is annoying when you write notebooks that you have to do http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CKNN.html
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, it is generic
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I always look up opencv
 lisitsyn	see what I mean?
 lisitsyn	there is no tool to look up for some class
 lisitsyn	no matter what project
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ?
@sonney2k	what do you mean?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it would be nice to have a tool that looks up documentation for various projects
 lisitsyn	shogun opencv whatever
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	I am rather doing small steps
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah I just share my thought about that :)
 lisitsyn	oops I haven't had any sleep for >40hrs :D see you later
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah if we had inf time that would be a nice website!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and easy to do even
@sonney2k	just some regex pattern thing url a -> url b
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes quite easy actually
 lisitsyn	well not just regex, sometimes a bit more complicated
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, besser82 try this: http://sgtb.eu/SVM
