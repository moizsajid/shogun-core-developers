 kislay	heya lisitsyn :)
 lisitsyn	kislay: hey
 kislay	lisitsyn, I just wanted to know, what are the essentials of an integration test.
 lisitsyn	kislay: well they just run something and check if the results are staying the same
 lisitsyn	kislay: if something is changed it is probably a bug
 kislay	lisitsyn, so If I run a basic kind of hello world program which uses the new library... will it be a perfect integration test!
 lisitsyn	well if you check whether results are identical or not - yes
 kislay	whats left to check in a hello world program. I have written a basic opencv to shogun matrix conversion test. But what to check?
 lisitsyn	kislay: this sounds like a unit-test
 lisitsyn	you could convert matrix and check whether they are identical
 kislay	oh!
 kislay	lisitsyn, if it doesn't matches then what should I produce as the output. Can you give me some already used example from the repo. It will help a lot.
 lisitsyn	kislay: check tests/unit
 lisitsyn	there are a bunch of unit-tests there
 kislay	lisitsyn, thanks. I will see it then.

@besser82	lisitsyn, ping?
@besser82	lisitsyn, about the c4.5 impl.
@besser82	lisitsyn, ain't that another license-encumbered algo?

 kislay	pickle27f, I have made a basic matrix conversion as per your gist
 kislay	pickle27f, http://pastebin.com/NrYxrb36
 kislay	pickle27f, but I have a feeling that I am missing the point
 pickle27f	that looks pretty good but for our first test we don't need to worry about the conversion
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@115.248.45.78] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
-!- [1]Saurabh7 is now known as Saurabh7
 pickle27f	we'll be building up a proper shogun class to do the conversion and then test that
 pickle27f	but yes all your test does at the moment is ensure we do the conversion without crashing
 pickle27f	it doesn't actually test that we did it properly
 kislay	pickle27f, should I send a PR with this?
 pickle27f	yeah lets get a PR up then I can make some inline comments
 kislay	pickle27f, great
-!- utsavjain [~utsav@1.22.61.14] has joined #shogun
 kislay	pickle27f, done!!
 pickle27f	can you tag me in it so it sends me an email
 pickle27f	I am @pickle27 on github
 kislay	pickle27f, sure
 pickle27f	thanks!
 pickle27f	I'll make some comments on this in a bit
 pickle27f	in the mean time you can start working on the factory class if you want!
 kislay	pickle27f, any starting point that may help!
 pickle27f	have you read up on factories? or builder objects
 pickle27f	it'll be a simple class that's only purpose is to take arguments and return objects
 pickle27f	so it will take opencv objects and return shogun objects
 pickle27f	and vice versa
 pickle27f	and remember my gist!
 kislay	pickle27f, yup. Thats good for me to go :)
 kislay	pickle27f, thanks

 amyc	hi, I had asked question on building shogun java modular on cygwin yesterday, as it is too hard, I have compiled on linux today (shogun.jar), however, using it can't find a lot of classes, such as isoMap, I can see class RealFeatures, DoubleMatrix, though. could anyone help me point me if something is missing? thanks!

 naywhayare	I know John Langford's cover tree code is in use here, and I think I've mentioned once or twice that it has a bug; so I figured I would also mention that he fixed it today, so you guys probably ought to pull in the new version where you use it:

 naywhayare	if this isn't actually of interest to anyone, sorry for the spam :)

 amyc	hi, could someone help me here: I have a java modular, and following the examples of java modular interface. I can't make converter example: Isomap class resolved, even though almost all other classes in the examples can be resolved. I noticed that some class need to "import static ..." to get to the actual class.But can't find it in isoMap example.
 amyc	I see CIsoMap in C class, could some point me how to import java's Isomap class?

 lisitsyn	hmmm really?
 lisitsyn	wait wait I can remember you said something about paper

 lisitsyn	though can find some mention of it
