 lambday	hi... this is soumyajit again.. I tried to run the java modular example [http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/modular_tutorial.html] but got some errors...
 lambday	 cannot find symbol symbol  : constructor RealFeatures(org.jblas.DoubleMatrix) location: class org.shogun.RealFeatures RealFeatures feats_train = new RealFeatures(traindata_real);
 lambday	same with BinaryLabels class...
 lambday	and another type mismatch
 lambday	incompatible types found   : org.shogun.RealVector required: org.jblas.DoubleMatrix DoubleMatrix out = obtain_from_generic(svm.apply(feats_test)).get_labels();
 lambday	is that a bug or I am doing something wrong? :(
 lambday	shall I take a look at src/interfaces/java_modular/swig_typemaps.i ?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :master * 2998970 / src/shogun/lib/SGMatrix.cpp: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/299897031ea438bbe18044d162cf4e9be4186885
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: include SGMatrixList.h instead of .cpp (Closes: #855)
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Thanks bianjiang for the fix!
 sonne|work	lambday: http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/java_modular_examples.html
 sonne|work	lambday: if you compile for java and run make check-examples these work...
 blackburn	sonne|work: surprising bug
 blackburn	with include.cpp
 shogun-buildbot_	build #850 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/850  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 sonne|work	yeah stupid typo?
 shogun-buildbot_	build #849 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/849  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 n4nd0	sonne|work: my bad
 n4nd0	I got probably confused for using a templated class separated in cpp and header

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Mention of include fix in NEWS. Related to #855
 lambday	sonne|work: hi... I tried with the make check-examples but its not working..
 lambday	make -C interfaces/java_modular check-examples-java_modular && true make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun/src/interfaces/java_modular' cd ../../../examples/undocumented/java_modular && \ ( LD_LIBRARY_PATH=//usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/lib ./check.sh    ) Load.java:2: package org.jblas does not exist import org.jblas.*; ^ Load.java:7: cannot find symbol symbol  : class DoubleMatrix location: class Load pu
 lambday	i have jblas-1.2.3.jar in /usr/share/java/jblas
 sonne|work	lambday: seems not to be in CLASSPATH ...
 lambday	sonne|work: while compiling with javac, I mentioned both jars (shogun.jar and jblas.jar) with -cp but even then its giving similar error :(
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hey
 n4nd0	sonne|work: is there any Username/password valid for the shogun-web in github?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: errm for what?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: you should be able to fork/checkout / just do a pull request as usual
 n4nd0	n4nd0: I think we are not talking about the same thing
 n4nd0	I mean
 n4nd0	if I run locally my shogun-web
 sonne|work	lambday: please try to create some minimal jblas example and try to get that work first
 n4nd0	in 127.0.0.1:8000 for example
 n4nd0	and I want to access 127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ohh - ask your friend - I forgot the password
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hehe ok - I think he is sleeping now or sth
 lambday	sonne|work: okay... thanks
 sonne|work	n4nd0: if you can figure out how to reset the passphrase - that would be good
 sonne|work	I would also like to have access to that stuff again :D
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I will ask him
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it seems that he doesn't remember...
 n4nd0	the credentials
 n4nd0	sonne|work: lol I got in
 lambday	sonne|work: hi... jblas example working.. [tried this one http://schabby.de/jblas-simple-example/]... used jblas with -cp, but then again tried to run classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.java and it doesn't compile... shall I try putting the jblas.jar in shogun installation dir/share/java?
 n4nd0	lambday: hey
 lambday	n4nd0: hello :)
 n4nd0	can you paste the line you use to compile for the jblas example that works
 n4nd0	and for the shogun example that doesn't
 lambday	javac -cp ".:/usr/home3/rahul/jblas/jblas-1.2.3.jar" jblas_test.java
 lambday	this works
 lambday	javac -cp ".:/usr/home3/rahul/jblas/jblas-1.2.3.jar:/usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/share/java/shogun.jar" classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.java
 lambday	this doesn't :(
 n4nd0	lambday: what does the error say?
 lambday	classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.java:57: cannot find symbol symbol  : constructor BinaryLabels(org.jblas.DoubleMatrix) location: class org.shogun.BinaryLabels BinaryLabels labels = new BinaryLabels(new DoubleMatrix(label_train_dna));                       ^ classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.java:65: incompatible types found   : org.shogun.RealVector required: org.jblas.DoubleMatrix DoubleMatrix out = obtain_from_gene
 n4nd0	lambday: mm alright
 lambday	what am I missing here :(
 n4nd0	so you could compile and run a minimal shogun java example?
 lambday	n4nd0: no.. minimal jblas example compiles... but I couldn't get shogun java example compiled with the commands I mentioned
 n4nd0	lambday: so no shogun example can be run?
 n4nd0	I am interested in finding out if the problem is due to java_modular interface not properly setup in your system
 n4nd0	or jblas not found with shogun examples
 n4nd0	lambday: do you see what I mean?
 lambday	well, i used configure with java_modular interface,
 lambday	wait let me paste first few lines of make check-examples
 lambday	http://pastebin.com/c2UBEi99
 n4nd0	lambday: in what dir are you executing that?
 lambday	shogun/src
 n4nd0	lambday: ok in src
 n4nd0	what I meant was
 n4nd0	if any of the examples in examples/undocumented/java_modular worked for you
 lambday	I tried with only one though and it didn't compile :(
 lambday	tried this one "classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.java"
 n4nd0	lambday: yep, but that one uses jblas
 n4nd0	my point is
 n4nd0	does your java_modular interface work at all?
 n4nd0	or the error arises when jblas comes into play?
 lambday	ohkay I got your point
 lambday	I'm trying with a hello world program
 n4nd0	yeah do that
 n4nd0	sth similar to examples/undocumented/libshogun/basic_minimal.cpp (BUT translated into java!) should be enough
 lambday	n4nd0: alright.... thanks a ton.. I'm trying :)
 n4nd0	no worries :)
 lambday	n4nd0: well, it compiles fine... I tried this code [http://pastebin.com/0bWfYiYf]... compiled with javac -cp ".:/usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/share/java/shogun.jar" helloworld.java
 lambday	but couldn't run it... with -Djava.library.path
 n4nd0	lambday: aham!
 lambday	java -cp ".:/usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/share/java/shogun.jar" -Djava.library.path=".:/usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/lib/jni/libmodshogun.so" helloworld
 n4nd0	what happens when you run it?
 lambday	it says
 lambday	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no modshogun in java.library.path at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1681) at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:840) at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1047) at helloworld.main(helloworld.java:5)
 lambday	tried with System.load() also but that too failed :-/
 n4nd0	lambday: mmm
 lambday	n4nd0: when I try with System.load("path/to/libmodshogun.so") it says -
 lambday	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Can't load library: /usr/home3/rahul/shogun/shogun_java/share/java/libmodshogun.so
 n4nd0	lambday: when you compiled shogun, what did you exactly?
 n4nd0	did you ./configure, make and then sudo make install?
 n4nd0	I am just guessing
 lambday	yeah
 lambday	not sudo, I installed it into another directory, specified with the configure --prefix option
 n4nd0	mmm ok
 n4nd0	I guess you should tell java somehow where your library is
 n4nd0	it could be the one you specified, I am not sure
 n4nd0	lambday: are you in linux?
 n4nd0	then try running whereis libshogun
 lambday	hmm... I thought -Djava.library.path=/path/to/libmodshogun.so" should do :(
 lambday	n4nd0: yes... fedora 16
 lambday	okay
 n4nd0	mmm I guess <path/to> should be substituted byt the path to libshogun hehe
 lambday	[rahul@cfdvs4-2 test]$ whereis libshogun libshogun: /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so /usr/local/lib/libshogun.a
 lambday	well... I guess whereis is giving the libshogun.so from a previous installation that I did on /usr/local :)
 lambday	n4nd0: okay I'm trying with libshogun.so path
 n4nd0	hehe yeah it can be
 n4nd0	I am not sure what kind of path is System.loadLibrary waiting for - I am not a java expert :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: LD_LIBRARY_PATH I think
 blackburn	n4nd0: and CLASSPATH should be set too
 blackburn	just take a look at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/java_modular/check.sh
 lambday	blackburn: now I am using System.load, which expects direct path to the shared library.. System.loadLibrary() didn't work for me
 n4nd0	lambday: ^
 lambday	blackburn: thanks... I'm checking :)
 blackburn	lambday: does ./check.sh work for you?
 lambday	blackburn: I guess I need to move a few files... according to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CLASSPATH... I'm trying..
 blackburn	lambday: I don't think you should move anything - check.sh is supposed to run in a typical case
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe < lambday> not sudo, I installed it into another directory, specified with the configure --prefix option
 n4nd0	that affects
 lambday	blackburn: I had jblas.jar in a different directory... I just moved that to /usr/share/java/jblas.jar... and running check.sh
 blackburn	ah
 lambday	its running... most of the examples shows ERROR, some showed OK
 blackburn	okay I see
 lambday	blackburn: but when I run a simple example like [http://pastebin.com/0bWfYiYf], it compiles fine but doesn't run..
 blackburn	lambday: something is wrong with LD_LIBRARY_PATH I guess
 lambday	blackburn: okay.. I'm trying again :(

 lambday	n4nd0: tried running classifier_domainadaptationsvm_modular.class and it worked :)
 n4nd0	lambday: cool
 n4nd0	then you are ready to play :)
 lambday	n4nd0: hope so.. can't wait to get my hands dirty :)
 lambday	need to do an assignment this week... will be using shogun :)
 n4nd0	lambday: cool, what is the assignment about?
 lambday	I gotta implement a string kernel...

 alexlovesdata	blackburn? Tai's formula? What is that person doing there?explicit integration??
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: hhahaha yeeeeeees
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: biologists reinvented integration
 alexlovesdata	who reviewed that?? A monkey? A Donkey?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: it is even listed in wikipedia page 'Peer-review fail'
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: wait wait
 blackburn	this one would kill you
 alexlovesdata	Thats the joke of the day :D :D :D

 alexlovesdata	zitirueyetsa 176 ???
 alexlovesdata	sorry ... I cant type kyrillian or the proper english replacement
 alexlovesdata	176 cites???
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: oops my url is bad for you
 alexlovesdata	O-M-G
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	176 cites
 alexlovesdata	life is sooo unfair :'(
 alexlovesdata	somebody cites this wheel reinvention 176
 alexlovesdata	my papers :'( :D
 alexlovesdata	bookmarked that! :D
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: next time you use integration cite it
 alexlovesdata	hahaha, the risk is that some reviewers would not get the irony
 alexlovesdata	7 months review time for THAT
 alexlovesdata	I guess they used an ant colony to rate that paper or so\
 alexlovesdata	unfortunately Ms. Tai has no webpage
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: yeah it is pretty old
 alexlovesdata	I still cant believe that reviewing these two pages took 7 months. Monty pythons happens every day
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: there are a lot of things to reinvent still
 blackburn	we should take it
 alexlovesdata	blackburn: there was a time when I thought about a career in mathematical physics, took courses in differential geometry about fiber bundles and classifications of lie groups and stuff like that
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I guess it is nearly impossible to get such fake in math. physics
 alexlovesdata	how about astrology :D ?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I had to take a few courses on that actually (especially on numeric)
 blackburn	yeah astrology is a great field
 blackburn	everything is possible
