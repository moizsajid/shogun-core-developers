 yoo	I am here
 blackburn	yoo:
 blackburn	evaluations should be handled other way I think
 blackburn	it is not domain specific
 yoo	okay
 yoo	but for exmaple, ROC results saved for one fold of crossval is exaclty the same computation as OVR Evaluation, right ?
 blackburn	sorry I didn't get that - what do you mean?
 yoo	before we added OVREvaluationResults to modelselectionoutput
 blackburn	ah you meant that it computes OvR labels, etc?
 yoo	yes
 blackburn	efficiency-wise it could be there
 yoo	then it can handle multiclassAccuracy, multiclassOVREvaluation
 yoo	 cross->add_cross_validation_output(mc_storage);
 yoo	CCrossValidationMulticlassStorage *mc_storage= new CCrossValidationMulticlassStorage();
 yoo	then as it was done before with moelSelection_output, it could be able to compute MC accuracy, and store also OVR ROC, PRC .. etc
 blackburn	okay I will add a list of binary evalutions to compute
 blackburn	and prc
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@122.174.91.222] has joined #shogun
 yoo	blackburn: and the associated structure for storing data, accuracy, roc, .. ?
 blackburn	yeah

 yoo	no more eig3 warnings, cool ! :p
 blackburn	yeah
 yoo	ahah I tried few days ago th update my eig3 lib but warning were still here
 yoo	to answer you question about cmake:
 yoo	there is just no link dependencies then for now it is impossible to compile with it
 blackburn	I am unsure I understand that
 blackburn	can you fix that?
 blackburn	:D
 yoo	I can try to make the CMakeLists.txt working if you need to, since I have a little experience with it
 blackburn	unsure again if I need that but if you need that I don't mind :D
 yoo	It could be "clean" to have that too
 blackburn	when we'd appreciate :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, then open http://94.23.237.10:5000/
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	pretty nice
@sonney2k	needs still quite a bit of work but it is getting there :)
@sonney2k	(that is the state from about a month ago)
@sonney2k	but I first have to get the infrastructure going then I will do some website polishing...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd rather remove new version available thing
 blackburn	it is much better what we had
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	why
 blackburn	why the first? looks way too fancy or sth like that
@sonney2k	it is supposed to look fancy
 blackburn	still - I don't like a few things design wise
@sonney2k	which?
 blackburn	download now button position, font size of 'shogun 2.0' thing
 blackburn	'new' thing too
 blackburn	I can try to suggest something once I am ready with a few dev things here
@sonney2k	blackburn, I like all the things you complained about btw
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	it is up to you

 yoo	blackburn: I got a compilation error with my cmake config
 yoo	/home/eric/buildsys/shogun/src/shogun/multiclass/ScatterSVM.cpp:227:2: error: 'CSVMLightOneClass' was not declared in this scope
 yoo	is there any config to link svmlight ?
 yoo	I didnt found any in the makefile
 blackburn	no I don't really understand that
 yoo	allright I will investigate,
 blackburn	yoo: should that be included before in cmakelists?
 yoo	got 75% good compilation fro now
 yoo	hmm
 yoo	did you make an include for this in yur makefile ?
 blackburn	no
 yoo	then neither in the cmakelists
 blackburn	strange..
 yoo	allright I get it
 blackburn	what is the reason?
 yoo	the MACRO USE_SVMLIGHT
 blackburn	why it matters?
 yoo	have to handle it in the cmakelists
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	well then you would have to handle all USE_* and HAVE_* macroses?
 yoo	I think so, since it is also handle in the makefile configure
 yoo	I am looking for another option
 yoo	give me a minute
 yoo	where is the USE_SVMLIGHT defined ?
 blackburn	yoo: shogun/lib/config.h
 yoo	allright
 yoo	I was apparently wrong
 yoo	I had a problem with link to li/external ..
 yoo	but compilation time is so long :p
 blackburn	yeah it is
 yoo	will it be possible to test MC storage tomorrow ?
 blackburn	yes
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@95.67.188.74] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	I am going to commit it in a few minutes
 yoo	I have still stucked with the cmake compilation
 yoo	strange ..  I have #define USE_SVMLIGHT  ot 1 but in ScatterSVM.h the #include <shogun/classifier/svm/SVMLightOneClass.h> is not used
 blackburn	yoo: here it goes
