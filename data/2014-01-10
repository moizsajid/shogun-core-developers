 besser82	sonne|work:  the problem isn't the pickle-protokoll
 besser82	sonne|work:  it is the incompat of binary-structures
 besser82	sonne|work:  like one can load pickles from Py2.X in Py3
 besser82	sonne|work:  an restore their contents...
 besser82	sonne|work:  but not that is not guranteed for c-compiled extension
 besser82	sonne|work:  basic types aren't the prob (str, int, float, list,...)
 besser82	sonne|work:  they will surely work
 besser82	sonne|work:  but stuff like numpy-array isn't compat
 besser82	sonne|work:  it can be restored with a trick, but the contents is garbled
 besser82	sonne|work:  and instances of classes from a c-compiled ext. are likely to fail / segfault
 besser82	sonney2k:  ^^^
 besser82	sonne|work, sonney2k:  but that actually is in nature of those pickles
 besser82	sonne|work, sonney2k:  but I just found a "nasty" hack that may or may not help; need to try that
 besser82	sonne|work, sonney2k:  but I just found a "nasty" hack that may or may not help; need to try that
 besser82	sonne|work, sonney2k:  we possibly might be able to restore the pickles by aletring them "manually" to reflect pickled str as bytes;  that might do the trick...
 besser82	sonne|work:  I assume the problem of that segfault is caused by sth. like the incompat of Py3::str and std::string / cstr
 besser82	sonne|work:  cstr == char*
 besser82	sonne|work:  a Py3::str may have a memory footprint of mixed width dependending on the type of char in it
 besser82	sonne|work:  so some char may have a width of 2 or 4 bytes, others just 1 byte
 besser82	sonne|work:  when std::string / char* is tied to 1 byte a char
 besser82	sonne|work:  so passing a Py3::str-type (created from Py2::Pickle) into c / c++ as is may cause that segfault
 besser82	sonne|work:  so I need to check whether this happenes when passing Py3::bytes to std::str / char*
 besser82	sonne|work:  Py3::bytes should be perfectly char*
 besser82	sonne|work:  which may / should
 besser82	sonne|work:  do the trick...
 sonne|work	hmmhh
 besser82	sonne|work: same assumption for numpy-array  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah scary hack.
 sonne|work	besser82: we need some other way in the future
 besser82	sonne|work:  other way for what? serialization of shogun::object?
 besser82	sonne|work:  pickling / data exports

 sonne|work	besser82: I think currently we compare objects with some string comparison or so - maybe we can just load them and have for different object types different comparators

 thoralf	Hey.
 besser82	sonne|work:  the assertions aren't the problem  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  the problem is restoring the *pristine* contents of the pickles
 besser82	thoralf:  Hey!
 thoralf	Hey Bjesser
 thoralf	:)
 besser82	sonne|work:  since the _Unpickler passes incompat binary-data into the modshogun / numpy classes  :-P
 besser82	thoralf:  :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  so we should change the way how objects are serialized for storage  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  like using json instead of pickles  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  which is pretty indep from lang / os / arch
 besser82	sonne|work:  only carries nice ascii which then gets eval() and pushed into the data-structs

 besser82	sonne|work:  still in need for rpm?
 besser82	sonne|work:  rpmdev-newspec is creating some skel
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah still in need
 besser82	sonne|work:  %prep %build %install %check %clean and such are like bash-script
 besser82	sonne|work:  need some template?
 besser82	sonne|work:  what kind of sw?
 sonne|work	on monday
 besser82	sonne|work:  kk
 sonne|work	work stuff
 sonne|work	but yeah cool...
 sonne|work	besser82: I basically have some directory
 sonne|work	that I just want to copy somewhere under /home/user
 sonne|work	and ship this as rpm
 sonne|work	that is all
 besser82	sonne|work:  then tar.gz that dir, list tarball as Source0
 sonne|work	besser82: probably ultra easy for you
 sonne|work	how?
 besser82	sonne|work:  yes, just a few seconds of work
 besser82	sonne|work:  shall i giv e you template?
 besser82	sonne|work:  like having some dummy tar and performing needed action of that
 sonne|work	yeah
 sonne|work	just this tar line
 besser82	first create tarball of the dir you want to ship: tar cf $my.tar $src
 besser82	sonne|work:  ^^^  then compress
 besser82	sonne|work:  like gz -9 $my.tar
 besser82	sonne|work:  then create some spec
 besser82	sonne|work:  %prep
 besser82	sonne|work:  %setup -qn $dir_in_tar
 besser82	sonne|work:  %build
 besser82	sonne|work:  # noop
 besser82	sonne|work:  %install
 besser82	sonne|work:  mkdir -p %yourtarget && cp -a . $your_target
 besser82	sonne|work:  %changelog
 besser82	sonne|work: done
 sonne|work	besser82: sounds good
 sonne|work	oki more monday
* sonne|work off home
 besser82	sonney2k:  I just prepared a rpm.spec example, doing what you said it should...
 besser82	sonney2k:  shall I mail it to you?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, how is your holidays?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: had exam today :D
 lisitsyn	yes I can notebook a little
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I thought you had vacations?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: they are over and exams are still here :(
 lisitsyn	good thing about it is that is the last exams I have to take any longer
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	wow some major changes here
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, parse error... that was your last exam?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, major changes?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: haha okay lets do it again
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I have two more exams but these are last as I'll just have to write up some thesis
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: major changes is what I see in git pull ;)
 lisitsyn	is that more parseable? ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes perfectly parseable :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, not so big changes - only in the build system
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, besser82 did a lot of python3 fixes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and we now have a new buildbot that checks for python3
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, quite a lot already works

 lisitsyn	sonney2k: cool
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am curious whether some quite major -> py3 conversion happens any day
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, where?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I just mean it is like between 2.7 and 3.x still
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I would say all major extensions are ported by now
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, doesn't mean it is used though - but I would guess that soon linux distributions are all switching over to python3.3 as default
@sonney2k	soon as in their next stable release
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: makes sense
* sonney2k is wrestling with the debian packages again...
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw did you know we have 4 weeks until gsoc deadline
 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: for fedora transition to py3 as default is scheduled for f22 ~ Dec. 2014 ;)

 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: python2 basically is dead, by means of interp-development
@sonney2k	besser82, yeah it just plain works(tm)
 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: 2.7.X is last release of py2-series; only bugfixes / security maintainance  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k:  Works? what?  Py3?
@sonney2k	both :)
@sonney2k	but 2.7 is rock stable
 besser82	sonney2k:  yes it is prooven stuff for sure; RHEL7 comes with it, but no Py3  :(
 adrin	besser82, don't worry about fedora deadlines, I don't remember the last time they were actually on time :D
@sonney2k	adrin, sounds like debian deadlines ;)
 besser82	adrin:  I know  ;)  I'm one of those Fedora-guys  ;)
 adrin	besser82: hahahahaha
 besser82	adrin:  https://badges.fedoraproject.org/user/besser82  :-P
 adrin	besser82: oh cool, I see :D pitty that I immigrated a while ago, unless I could blame you all the time :P
 besser82	adrin:  :-P  Then just come back and checkout all brand-new bugz in new F20
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: 4 weeks?
 lisitsyn	ohshhhhhh
 adrin	besser82: lol, I just found rolling distros more comfortable at some point, but thanks for the offer ;)
 besser82	adrin:  fedora offer rolling, too  ;)  Checkout rawhide
 besser82	adrin:  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide/de
 adrin	besser82: lol, yeah I remember it, I used to switch to rawhide all the time no later than a beta release. But you have to admit alphas and pre-alphas are really really unstable.
 besser82	adrin:  not what I saw from the last 3 pre-alphas
 besser82	adrin:  there had been some quirks for sure, but they were pretty good for workstation use
 adrin	besser82: I see, the last time I had a fedore was probably three releases ago, I'll have a look again :-)
 besser82	adrin:  I had been shifting to F18 / F19 / F20 pre-alpha immediatly after branch-off and basically all stuff was usable, but some minor gliches  :D
 besser82	adrin:  nice to hear!
 adrin	besser82: after all, I'm way more comfortable around rpm baseds.
 besser82	adrin:  btw. there are nice shogun-rpms avail in official fedora-repo  ;)
 adrin	besser82: I'm sure glinches are not worst than gentoo ones ;)
 besser82	adrin:  not even comparable  ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I told you we are late this time with me not pushing you guys :D
 besser82	adrin:  the worst glitch I had was systemd spamming /var/log in F20 Alpha TC3
@sonney2k	lisitsyn,  on the other hand we did some releases
 adrin	besser82: I know :D ok, gotta go, schones wochenende ;)
 besser82	adrin:  Dir ebenfalls!  :D
 besser82	adrin:  Danke
 adrin	besser82: systemd is also a hasel in gentoo.
 besser82	adrin:  in Fedora it is pretty good running now
 besser82	adrin:  as basically the same ver is targeted for RHEL7

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you please twitter like hell about shogun stuff?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, as in new releases
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, all right
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, that we want to participate in gsoc 2014
@sonney2k	and are looking for mentors etc?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, okok
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, btw, I think I'd prefer mentoring this year
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and that we are back in debian https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, very welcome
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, what would you want to do?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, great
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I was thinking of proposing a project in MCMC since it is related to my PhD
@sonney2k	maybe baseline ML algorithms?
@iglesiasg	Heiko knows about it too
@sonney2k	heh
-!- zxtx_ [~zv@129-79-241-148.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	I guess HeikoS would want to do it :D
@iglesiasg	we can discuss about it then
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, no idea if Heiko this year wants to participate as student?
@iglesiasg	I can mentor him lol
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, excellent suggestion
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, make sure to push him hard
@sonney2k	otherwise he will get a side job and learn a new music instrument
@iglesiasg	haha yeah
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, he just doesn't work w/o pressure ;)
@iglesiasg	your call to retweet now guys
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok I did all the marketing I could :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: let you mentor me
 lisitsyn	!
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	I am still eligible
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, haha ok, a pleasure :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we can play with rose ponies if you'd like
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I would learn from you instead of the other way round though :D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am curious what would be on carol's mind if she see a guy jumping from student to mentor and back
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	hehe
@iglesiasg	curious situation indeed
@iglesiasg	but I'd say it is fine
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, would you like to be student this year?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no no
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well marry sb. in rossia and you can see the look on her face :D
 lisitsyn	it would be unfair
* sonney2k afk
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I see your point
 lisitsyn	I mean I won't have much time
@iglesiasg	but taking into account some of the projects there have been and the work done...
 lisitsyn	real students have much more time to enjoy that
 lisitsyn	not just sponsor some work
@iglesiasg	that is true
 lisitsyn	and I can't predict where I am going to be just in a few months :D
@iglesiasg	and well, the idea is also trying to get people that may become contributors
@iglesiasg	hehe
 lisitsyn	some kind of decision period soon
 lisitsyn	and this sucks phew :D
@iglesiasg	c'mon!
@iglesiasg	those periods should be exciting :)
* besser82 is off
@iglesiasg	besser82, you could mentor some infra stuff maybe
@wiking	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeentoooooooooooooooooooooooooor
@wiking	:D
@wiking	iglesiasg: have u managed to check out those things?
@iglesiasg	wiking, HR department is having a look and said we would talk this week
@iglesiasg	next week hehe
@sonney2k	wiking, what do you want to do?
@wiking	iglesiasg: great!
@wiking	iglesiasg: fight for your right!
@sonney2k	night all
@iglesiasg	good nighty
 besser82	iglesiasg:  infra stuff like?!?
@iglesiasg	besser82, one of the many stuff you usually suggest ;)
@iglesiasg	wiking, lisitsyn, anybody there?
