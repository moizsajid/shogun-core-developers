@wiking	OXPHOS, ping
 OXPHOS	wiking: hey sgvector serialization should be working now. I just squashed
@wiking	yeah i know
@wiking	but i just replied :)
@wiking	read it and if you are open to talk a bit
@wiking	lets talk :)
 OXPHOS	wiking: kk
 OXPHOS	wiking: also I had problem fetching from shogun. I thought it was the network but seems not..
@wiking	fetching what?
 OXPHOS	Mac148934:shogun zora$ git fetch upstream
 OXPHOS	fatal: unable to connect to github.com:
 OXPHOS	github.com[0: 192.30.253.112]: errno=Operation timed out
@wiking	aaah
 OXPHOS	wiking ^
@wiking	check status.github.com
@wiking	``` All systems operational ```
@wiking	but who knows...
 OXPHOS	wiking: I can fetch shogun-data
 OXPHOS	wiking: and I was experiencing the same problem ~12h ago..
@wiking	ping github on twitter
@wiking	i bet they'll answer in no time :)
 OXPHOS	wiking: so it's their problem : ) lemme try
@wiking	yep i mean all our code is on github
@wiking	so yeah i cannot help
 OXPHOS	wiking: kk thx

@wiking	OXPHOS,
@wiking	so the problem is we just cannot include cereal headers
@wiking	unless we make cereal dependency a STRONG dependency
 OXPHOS	wiking: like Eigen?
@wiking	well no not really
@wiking	because in eigen the problem is solved internally
@wiking	meaning that although we download eigen for building shogun
@wiking	but we dont distribute it
@wiking	because we compile the header related stuff into shogun
@wiking	but what you are doing now is actually making the cereal dependency outside of shogun
@wiking	imagine that you compile and install libshogun
@wiking	(without the cereal headers)
@wiking	i mean without having cereal on the system
@wiking	then you'll download cereal to build libshogun
@wiking	and then ...?
@wiking	if the user creates a new example
@wiking	in c++ where he uses shogun
@wiking	he will not be able to compile it at all
@wiking	because a) he doesn't have cereal installed on the system
@wiking	b) the headers you used for shogun to compile are long gone
@wiking	do you get what i'm trying to say here?
@wiking	in eigen case things are all wrapped into .cpp
 OXPHOS	wiking: not sure..so they have to be moved away from .h files in shogun?
@wiking	so yeah
@wiking	basically the idea is
@wiking	that if we cannot solve
@wiking	not to include cereal headers
@wiking	in our headers
@wiking	then we have to make cereal a strong dependency
@wiking	note: not having some type defined is fine, because those can be forward declared in headers
@wiking	see the trick about Eigen in SGVector
@wiking	(SGVector.h)
 OXPHOS	wiking: you mean the namespace Eigen{} stuff?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	that is all because
@wiking	we do not want to include eigen related headers in our headers
@wiking	only in cpp
 OXPHOS	wiking: not checked closely yet - but there's include <Eigen/xx> in mathematics/eigen3.h
@wiking	:)
@wiking	and where do we include eigen3.h? ?:)
@wiking	i mean trust me
@wiking	i know what i'm talking about ehre
@wiking	:)
@wiking	no need to check things like this
 OXPHOS	wiking: yeah i believe you are :) ..trying to make myself clear. so the goal is to move cereal stuff to .cpp
@wiking	(btw you do realise that mathematics/eigen3.h is just a wrapper around Eigen/xxxx headers )
@wiking	but yeah the idea is that
@wiking	in headers
@wiking	that exposed to the public
@wiking	(say not linalg related headers)
@wiking	you should not include cereal headrs
@wiking	only in definition
@wiking	meaning cpp
@wiking	if that's not solveable
@wiking	we'll have to default to the idea
@wiking	that we gonna make cereal a strong dependency
@wiking	but let's try to concentrate now on the
 OXPHOS	okay..I think I got it
@wiking	part where we could solve this
@wiking	and btw yeah it all makes sense
@wiking	why it was working for you on your machine
@wiking	as i believe you have cereal installed on your system
@wiking	while on travis it was using the internal cereal (fetching as the part of cmake build...)
 OXPHOS	I tried removed it - and it also worked..I guess some settings are different
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	it should not
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but ok
@wiking	the problem is this definitely atm
@wiking	that we act like we have cereal headers installed globally
 OXPHOS	yeah
@wiking	where we fake it sometimes...
 OXPHOS	haha
 OXPHOS	wiking
 OXPHOS	thanks!
 OXPHOS	lemme work on it
@wiking	nw thnx for looking at it
@wiking	can you do rebases on some of the prs?
@wiking	or github is not working for you atm?
 OXPHOS	wiking: not working - only fetch upstream is not working
@wiking	can you copy paste the exact error lines?
 OXPHOS	wiking: 1 sec. it takes a while to know it's failed :)
 OXPHOS	wiking: http://pastebin.com/4MEQb63Q
@wiking	can you
@wiking	ping github.com
@wiking	?
 OXPHOS	wiking: PING github.com (192.30.253.113): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 192.30.253.113: icmp_seq=0 ttl=52 time=68.613 ms
 OXPHOS	and so on..
@wiking	mmm yeah
@wiking	ok try
@wiking	nc
@wiking	ok not this
@wiking	but
@wiking	nc -vz github.com 443
@wiking	and then
@wiking	nc -vz 192.30.253.112 443
 OXPHOS	wiking: http://pastebin.com/Dg5FBJtQ
 OXPHOS	wiking: succeeded
@wiking	haha
@wiking	cat shogun/.git/config
 OXPHOS	wiking: I should do it in dir upstream shogun right?
 OXPHOS	Mac148934:Github zora$ cd shogun/.git/config -bash: cd: shogun/.git/config: Not a directory
@wiking	i mean within your shogun just do
@wiking	cat .git/config

@wiking	k
 OXPHOS_	wiking: http://pastebin.com/m6c8bf1P
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	when have you added the upstream to your config?
@wiking	was it ever working?
@wiking	as i believe you dont have access rights to the upstream repo
@wiking	[remote "upstream"]
@wiking	    url = git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
@wiking	and this would only work in that case
@wiking	you should edit your config
@wiking	and use https
@wiking	url = https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
@wiking	and yeah that git thign was toootaly weird
 OXPHOS_	what..I never touched it can I used it pretty frequently..
@wiking	because if then it should have been
@wiking	git@github.com...
@wiking	so i dont really know how this got into this state
@wiking	but no wonder it's not working
 OXPHOS_	wiking: haha thanks! it must be hacked..or maybe wired : /
 OXPHOS_	wiking: it's back to work!
@wiking	yep
@wiking	so rebase now plz
@wiking	:)
 OXPHOS_	wiking: i'm running(checking) it at local now. I'll push once it's done.

@wiking	Saurabh7, ping
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.13.13] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	lisitsyn, wiking yo\
 sanuj	lisitsyn, are you working on SG_ADD?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah will spend some time on that today
 lisitsyn	didn't get time yesterday tho
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay, how to make swig interfaces for shogun templates like SGVector?
 lisitsyn	not get it
 lisitsyn	we specialize sgvector for specific types
 sanuj	lisitsyn, shogun-base.i looks like this: https://gist.github.com/sanuj/a85986fb35052de761ac251496e90e90
 lisitsyn	once specialized it is just some time
 lisitsyn	type
 sanuj	we had left the templates since you wanted to discuss with HekioS and wiking
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so i just do SGVector<blah>
 sanuj	?
 lisitsyn	yeah I think so
 sanuj	even i think there is no way
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so i'll just do SGVector with some primitive types, just for demonstration
 lisitsyn	ok
@wiking	?
@wiking	RealVector
@wiking	is SGVector<float64_t>
@wiking	etc.
@wiking	i dont really understand the swig interface for shogun templates like sgvector Saurabh7
@wiking	sanuj:
 sanuj	wiking, yes yes
@wiking	meaning? :)
@wiking	we dont use SGVector for other types than primitive types
@wiking	for none primitive types there are other data structs
 sanuj	wiking, i mean i got it now :)
 sanuj	had forgotten about RealVector etc
@wiking	k

@wiking	that was fast
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.22.232] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	wiking, yo
@wiking	what's happening
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking, can you review this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3357
 sanuj	i think it's done
@wiking	k
@wiking	checking
 sanuj	wiking, MockObject is also used for integration testing
@wiking	dont care
@wiking	:)
@wiking	if it's for testing
@wiking	then it's no place
@wiking	for that in code created for runtime
 sanuj	wiking, so where do i put it then?
@wiking	for tests
@wiking	where ever they need to be
@wiking	but not into a runtime
@wiking	where you possibly not going to be using it
@wiking	if you think there's no way you can solve it
@wiking	tests for macros are still possible
@wiking	although again i dont understand that why does a mock  object
@wiking	has to be in runtime
 sanuj	wiking, i am not clear what you mean by runtime?
@wiking	 src/interfaces/modular/SGBase.i
 sanuj	and MockObject is in SGBase.i so that it is available in python for integration tests
@wiking	is something that will be created
@wiking	no matter
@wiking	if you do ever an integration test
@wiking	or not
@wiking	right?
@wiking	i mean  src/interfaces/modular/SGBase.i  -> modshogun.i -> modshogun<interface>_wrap.cxx
@wiking	-> swig SO library
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	wiking, it has to be in modshogun.i, one way or another
@wiking	ok so if i'm user HailMerry
@wiking	who just wanna use shogun
@wiking	from python
@wiking	do i need that?
@wiking	mockobject?
 sanuj	no
@wiking	ok
 sanuj	wiking, so only make it available when enable_testing=on?
@wiking	now you understand?
@wiking	yeah
 sanuj	wiking, yeah, so i only need to add some MACRO checks?
 sanuj	just confirming
@wiking	idk if there's actually a C level MACRO when we are running tests :)
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	wiking, TagRealVector and RealVector are different because TagX is used to identify an object of X by a name
 sanuj	shall i put this in modshogun.i?
 sanuj	+#ifdef HAVE_JINJA2
 sanuj	 +%include "shogun-base.i"
 sanuj	 +#endif
 sanuj	instead of SGBase.i
 sanuj	wiking, by doing this, i can write this as
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3357/files#diff-9096c96ee0cb9b5463c3fc420ed96b0aR12
 sanuj	RealVector, RealVector*
