 CaBa	is the CSpectrumRBFKernel class available in python?
 lisitsyn	probably
 lisitsyn	as SpectrumRBFKernel
 CaBa	lisitsyn: well I can't find it, that's why I'm asking
 CaBa	lisitsyn: I imported shogun.Kernel, I guess that's where it should reside, right?
 lisitsyn	CaBa: oh that's just helper
 lisitsyn	try 'from modshogun import *'
 CaBa	lisitsyn: name not defined
 lisitsyn	what name?
 CaBa	lisitsyn: can i see anywhere which classes were blacklisted for swig?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	a second
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/interfaces/modular/Kernel.i
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	it is missed
 CaBa	oh?
 lisitsyn	wonder why
 CaBa	can you elaborate?
 CaBa	i'm not following ;)
 lisitsyn	sorry
 lisitsyn	ok it looks pretty outdated
 lisitsyn	even if you add it to Kernel.i it won't work
 lisitsyn	needs more changes
 CaBa	well the SpectrumMismatchRBFKernel is there at least
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	I have no idea to be honest
 lisitsyn	how these both work
 lisitsyn	:D
 CaBa	on another note, what does it mean when I get a NotImplementedError
 lisitsyn	hmm depends
 lisitsyn	what do you call?
 CaBa	lisitsyn: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Yy9uyTQh
 CaBa	a constructor
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	wrong types of arguments
 CaBa	so it it says wrong number it actually means wrong type? ;)
 lisitsyn	yeah.. that comes from swig actually
 lisitsyn	it needs like some patching or so

 CaBa	'StringCharFeatures' is an example for a template specialization being translated by swig?
 CaBa	it's equivalent to StringFeatures<char>?
 CaBa	CStringFeatures<char>
 CaBa	seems so... figured looking into Features.i kinda explains the mappings...
