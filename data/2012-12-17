 sonne|work	wiking: whats up with multiclass?

 wiking	sonne|work: libsvm multiclass doesn't work with 3 classes
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	so basically all OvO MC stuff is b0rken right now?
 sonne|work	or just libsvm?
 wiking	libsvm
 wiking	sonne|work: indexing problem
 sonne|work	wiking: you have your verbose day today?
 wiking	?
 wiking	verbose day?:)
 sonne|work	yeah - 3 words withing 12 minutes!
 wiking	lol
 wiking	yeah working in the meanwhile ;)
 sonne|work	I almost have an idea what you are talking about
 wiking	so yeah the problem is with multiclass libsvm, having only 3 classes
 wiking	it complains about indexing
 sonne|work	and w/ 4 classes or 2 it works correctly?
 wiking	                                REQUIRE(set_svm(idx, svm),"SVM set failed");
 wiking	this line fails
 wiking	MulticlassLIBSVM.cpp:194
 sonne|work	I am a bit concerned that everything is broken ...
 wiking	it works with 4 classes, i haven't tested 2 classes
 sonne|work	wiking: correctly even?
 sonne|work	or just 'works' as in doesn't crash
 wiking	basically i know that n > 3 classes works correctly
 sonne|work	ok
 wiking	well it gives me good result
 wiking	but maybe it doesn't give me as good as i would like it ;)
 wiking	haven't tested using libsvm purely if that's what you r asking
 wiking	i don't know if there's a difference between our libsvm and the original implementation's ouptut
 wiking	*output

 wiking	sonne|work: hey here ?
 wiking	sonne|work:  i was just wondering that for how long we should archive the static analyzer output?
 wiking	sonne|work: as it now starts to eat up significant amount of space ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: do as you wish ... some kind of binary granularity?
 sonne|work	like every day for 1 week
 sonne|work	then say 8 more weeks but just weekly?
 wiking	sonne|work: now we have december accessible right away and the rest in tar.bz2
 wiking	yeah i'll do some kind of a weekly thing after 1 month or so
 wiking	since keeping all that tar.bz2 is kind of waste
 wiking	i reckon nobody will dig that out :P
 sonne|work	wiking: just remove it then
 sonne|work	it doesn't really help us to have a long history here

 Guest80301	Hi
 blackburn	hi
 Guest80301	I would like to work with spectrum RBF kernel, anybody work with this before?
 Guest80301	I am a bit puzzled it is not working from R and based on my information, if something implemeted in shogun it has to work from all interfaces, Am I right or not?
 Guest80301	anybody ineterested to talk about this?
 blackburn	Guest80301: I answered you in the mailing list
 Guest80301	where?
 Guest80301	ok I just go and check
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	you answered already okay
 blackburn	Guest80301: what if you try WEIGHTEDDEGREERBF?
 blackburn	I see no reason not to work with R but I do not remember if case matters
 Guest80301	it seems to work I don't get the same error
 Guest80301	ump <- sg('set_kernel', 'WEIGHTEDDEGREERBF') Error in sg("set_kernel", "WEIGHTEDDEGREERBF") :    [ERROR] Usage: set_kernel  sg('set_kernel', type, size[, kernel-specific parameters])
 blackburn	there are a few parameters here
 Guest80301	let's see if I set up the parameters it works
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	bad you can't use modular interface
 blackburn	it is much comprehensive
 Guest80301	I am using static interface
 blackburn	I know
 Guest80301	MY data set the the dna data set which is in the 'data' folder of shogun
 Guest80301	dump <- sg('set_kernel', 'WEIGHTEDDEGREERBF', 'CHAR', size_cache, degree) > km <- sg('get_kernel_matrix', 'TRAIN') Error in sg("get_kernel_matrix", "TRAIN") :    [ERROR] Kernel can not process this train feature type: 30 10.
 Guest80301	It is hard to figure it out without any example :(
 blackburn	I am not sure weight degree rbf is the choice for string data
 blackburn	I can even say it won't work with strings
 blackburn	Guest80301: there are other string kernels so please rather try them
 Guest80301	it seems to be a good choice for me since I don't know the structure of my string and this weighted degree kernels let me to have shifts and mis matches
 Guest80301	I am not sure about rbf part
 blackburn	drop rbf and it will serve you
 Guest80301	If you have a check on the mailing list I am also trying it without rbf but still not working
 blackburn	Guest80301: could that example help you? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/r_static/kernel_weighteddegreestring.R
 Guest80301	I have been thorough this example but as you can see the only defined argument for kernel is degree
 Guest80301	therefor there is nothing about mis-match and shifts
 Guest80301	these axamples need some work to make them more helpful
 blackburn	I am afraid nobody will touch that ever :)
 Guest80301	:((
 blackburn	we have neither power nor will to support static interfaces
 Guest80301	what is a systematic way to find out the parameters of a kernel function written in shogun
 blackburn	it works like a charm with modular I think ;)
 blackburn	well
 Guest80301	ok that means it is a self discovery
 blackburn	probably I am not sure
 blackburn	it is pretty clear with modular as it is just as is
 Guest80301	I have never used modular ones
 Guest80301	another question does shogun work with matlab under windows?
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/python_modular/kernel_weighted_degree_string_modular.py
 blackburn	IIRC it should but no guarantees
 Guest80301	this is an example in python I saw similar example for matlab
 Guest80301	thanx I am going to work on it
 Guest80301	bye now
