@sonney2k	I am too sleepy now g'night.
 f-x	okay, see ya!

 sploving1	blackburn,
 blackburn	yes?
 sploving1	parameter_list.add(Arrays.asList(new Double(0.9), new Double(1e-3), new Integer(1)));
 sploving1	why int num_threads = ((Integer)para.get(2)).intValue(); said: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 2
 sploving1	blackburn, do you know what is the matter?
 blackburn	sploving1: no, looks strange
 sploving1	blackburn, I got know. my mistake
 sploving1	blackburn, svm.parallel.set_num_threads(num_threads);
 sploving1	cannot find variable parallel
 blackburn	no idea
 sploving1	oh
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.230] has quit [Quit: Ooops..!!]
 sploving1	what does this error mean? [ERROR] Not a two class labeling - no positively labeled examples found
 sploving1	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: [ERROR] Not a two class labeling - no positively labeled examples found
 sploving1	blackburn, sonney2k,
 blackburn	exactly what it says - you have olny one class labelling
 sploving1	blackburn, svm.set_linear_term(new DoubleMatrix(new double[] {-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-7,-6}));
 sploving1	how to fix the above statement?
 blackburn	check labels passed to svm
 sploving1	blackburn, double label_train_dna[] = {-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1};
 sploving1	Labels labels = new Labels(new DoubleMatrix(label_train_dna));
 sploving1	maybe this statement is wrong
 blackburn	it should be ok
 sploving1	so strange
 sploving1	blackturn, i know. DoubleMatrix(new double[] {value1, value2, ...})Constructs a column vector.
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	make a row :)
 sploving1	yeap

 blackburn	sonney2k: I came with new task for me: static memory relaxed fibonacci heap :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, you dont' like the easy things do you ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it could be the fastest isomap in shogun ;)
 blackburn	even for really large datasets it could act well in theory
 blackburn	sth like O(n^2 log 1/n)
@sonney2k	that's the spirit
 blackburn	spirit?
 blackburn	from next week work on cover tree porting should be started
@sonney2k	all very welcome
 blackburn	chris will be grandmentor (just like father becomes grandfather)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	cause I will be some kind of mentor for guy that will try to port cover tree
@sonney2k	will that turn me into grand-grand-mentor or grand-admin?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	Soeren the godfather I guess
 blackburn	why not to play some mafia here :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I prefer benevolent dictator - but hey I am no longer alone :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: who are? :)
@sonney2k	rumor has it - that some mad vodka drinking Russian is launching nuclear missiles too
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm sure you are ;)
* sonney2k wonders if blackburn got replaced by some bot
 blackburn	hehe

@sonney2k	f-x, hi
 f-x	sonney2k: hey!
@sonney2k	I am more alive today
 f-x	I too just got back now, read your mail
 f-x	have you observed this kind of behaviour with that dataset before? i mean performance decreases with the last 100k or so examples
 f-x	i'm pretty sure the online SGD and the original are essentially identical, except for lambda and epochs
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah but I might have made a mistake translating it
@sonney2k	f-x, so I would suggest to use liblinear
@sonney2k	for liblinear we have guarantees
 f-x	sonney2k: you mean a version of liblinear using the new framework?
@sonney2k	f-x, I meant just the batch version
 f-x	ok
@sonney2k	f-x, there is a script on the website to convert the data files into svmlight format
@sonney2k	which sparse features can directly read
 f-x	sonney2k: ok thanks, i'll use that. but my computer can't take like more than 1 GB data at once
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah then just use a subset
 f-x	so I think the examples will be in the 100k-200k range
 f-x	and testing on say 10k examples which were not used for training?
@sonney2k	f-x, you should get similar results with liblinear
@sonney2k	f-x, I would test on 100k examples too
 f-x	sonney2k: ah. okay.. btw how was testing done for the alpha dataset?
 f-x	did you have some extra labelled data with you?
@sonney2k	f-x, labels are non-public
@sonney2k	so use say first 100-200k examples for traiing
@sonney2k	and the next 100k examples for testing
 f-x	was just asking :) sure..
@sonney2k	f-x, but shouldn't make a difference
 f-x	sonney2k: yeah.. i'll get on with that.. anything else you think i should be working on in the meantime?
@sonney2k	f-x, I mean the next steps would be to integrate liblinear/sgd-qn/vw
@sonney2k	of course getting this benchmark to work and speed optimizations
@sonney2k	f-x, sgd-qn should be trivial to do for you (very similar to sgd)
 f-x	yes - i browsed through the code, and they looked pretty similar
@sonney2k	f-x, regarding liblinear I would only translate the CLibLinear::solve_l2r_l1l2_svc function
-!- phrhbk [~asdfasdf@host-57-20.warwick.ac.uk] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@sonney2k	and this time provide an OnlineLibLinear in addition to the batch variant
 f-x	sonney2k: yes.. just like we did for sgd
@sonney2k	f-x, for sgd we will only keep the online variant at some point
@sonney2k	but liblinear has many solvers and the svm one is sufficient to us
 f-x	okay.. for now i'll do the testing with liblinear and begin with OnlineLibLinear
@sonney2k	yeah these online learners won't be a lot of work - but it will be more interesting and the benchmarking will actually tell us whether things are correct and what we can improve
 blackburn	another day another wrapper
 blackburn	sonney2k: grant me rights to execute CustomDistance ;)
 bettyboo	HA
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I use it in landmark mds - I pass landmark distance matrix using it - but it creates a copy of matrix
 blackburn	because it is only float32_t and I use float64_t
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course it is float32_t
@sonney2k	it tries to be efficient
 blackburn	and produces necessarity of copy matrix..
@sonney2k	I mean when you have to store the matrix you should try to be
@sonney2k	well then don't get the copy but the float32_t version
 blackburn	distance always returns float64_t?
 blackburn	btw I guess I should use triangular matrices

 blackburn	shit I've got the most beautiful embedding I ever seen
 blackburn	http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/718/imagepw.png/
@sonney2k	:)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes distcance returns float64_t  /scalars/
@sonney2k	but the matrix itself is squeezed as float32...
 blackburn	phew
 blackburn	don't like it a bit
@sonney2k	I guess I will never understand
 blackburn	what?
@sonney2k	what your problem with this is
 blackburn	I get the whole matrix
@sonney2k	and?
@sonney2k	just get the float32 one
 blackburn	how to get float32 one?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I see - it is not templated like in Kernel.h
@sonney2k	basically, the distance class evolved from the kernel class
@sonney2k	the kernel class has that function
@sonney2k	the distance class has not
@sonney2k	uh
 blackburn	aha
@sonney2k	and I see a new problem
@sonney2k	we do return some SGMatrix<xx>
 blackburn	I have found a way to slow down LLE 20x
@sonney2k	but is it possbile to have two functions with same name and no input args but different output args?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	I guess :)
 bettyboo	weird
 blackburn	how can compiler know what do you want? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, it could - I mean it knows the output type
@sonney2k	and that should match
 blackburn	ehh. if you call foo() how can compiler know you want int foo()?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well if you do int x = foo() it is clear
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm not sure it is clear for gcc ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, the problem is that one can drop return arguments
@sonney2k	i.e. call a function ignoring the result
 blackburn	get distance matrix and lost result
 blackburn	hmm pretty way to get garbage
 blackburn	:)
