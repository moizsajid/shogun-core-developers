@sonney2k	f-x, I had some minor comments to your patch
@sonney2k	f-x, please fix before I apply
@sonney2k	thx
 f-x	sonney2k: oh you're right, the enum thing i don't like.. will see how to get rid of it
@sonney2k	f-x, doesn't it work w/o the enum?
@sonney2k	I mean you include the proper header file it seems
 f-x	sonney2k: it didn't work without it, iirc
 f-x	i'll see if it works by including another .h
@sonney2k	f-x, no
@sonney2k	the file is already included
 f-x	sonney2k: then you say it should work without explicit declaration in the .i file?
@sonney2k	it should
 f-x	ok, trying again
 f-x	anyways it shouldn't work at all if the correct .h isn't included even now
@sonney2k	f-x, actually no - you forgot to include VwParser.h
 f-x	sonney2k: yeah, was going to include that only
@sonney2k	f-x, so please include that in IO.i
 f-x	so how does it work when i declare it?
 f-x	ok
@sonney2k	f-x, done?
 f-x	sonney2k: not quite - says something like 'NotImplementedError: Wrong number or type of arguments for overloaded function 'StreamingVwFile_set_parser_type'.
 f-x	  Possible C/C++ prototypes are:
 f-x	    shogun::CStreamingVwFile::set_parser_type(E_VW_PARSER_TYPE)
 f-x	    shogun::CStreamingVwFile::set_parser_type()
 f-x	'
 f-x	sonney2k: still trying to figure that one out..
@sonney2k	f-x, how do you call the function?
 f-x	sonney2k: from the .py?
@sonney2k	yes
 f-x	file.set_parser_type(T_SVMLIGHT)
@sonney2k	f-x, and where did you do the include of VwParser.h?
 f-x	sonney2k: IO_includes.i and IO.i
@sonney2k	f-x, *before* you include streaminfvwfile?
 f-x	oh possibly!
 f-x	sonney2k: should i shift?
 f-x	sonney2k: no, no.. i did it after
 f-x	at the end of the other decls in IO

 blackburn	sonney2k: can it skip builds to the last commit?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea - just let it do its job - it is all now running on 4 cores so will be done by tomorrow morning - and it is a good burn in test
 blackburn	sonney2k: about russian doc - I'm not going lazy but seriously, there are only few of machine learning researchers in russia and almost everyone having university education can read english one
 blackburn	probably it would be better to have some links to shogun on russian IT/machine learning/etc sites
@sonney2k	blackburn, I can tell it would be nice to have a language other than chinese
@sonney2k	I guess I should do german too
 blackburn	I don't think so
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I am thinking of putting the doc different dirs on the website:
 blackburn	what is the purpose of german doc?
@sonney2k	1) /shogun/doc/current (for the current stable release)
 blackburn	it seems >90% of german researchers know english pretty well
 blackburn	same for russian
@sonney2k	2) /shogun/doc/latest (for the latest development docs)
@sonney2k	so we can have the buildbot build a doc and put it there (and potentially nightly snapshots if everything ran through)

 blackburn	I like the phrase "complete: failure"
 blackburn	sonney2k: we nead MOAR developers :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: why gunnar choiced to not using shogun?
 blackburn	I have seen msplicer succeeder mgene is not shogun based

 heiko	wow :)
 heiko	gotta pull
@sonney2k	blackburn, it makes sense to have native language documentation - that attracts also non-machine learners / beginners.

@sonney2k	(I spend a lot of time to set up the build bot today)
 heiko	sonney2k, ok the example is not wokring without a file
 heiko	its not that important
 heiko	simply loads an instance from a file
 heiko	and the file contains an older version
 heiko	more important are the new methods in CSGOBject
 heiko	I am currently doing the stuff for files that have no version
 heiko	then we can load the older serialized files
@sonney2k	heiko, what does 'BTW when the serialized file has no version, nothing works now.' mean?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	thats what i am currently doing
@sonney2k	I don't even undertand it
 heiko	it means that if a serialized file has no file_verison in it, the loading does not work
 heiko	only if the file HAS a version which is older than the current
 heiko	a file like this
 heiko	<<_SHOGUN_SERIALIZABLE_ASCII_FILE_V_00_>>
 heiko	number float64 10
 heiko	number2 float64 2
 heiko	does not work
 heiko	but
 heiko	<<_SHOGUN_SERIALIZABLE_ASCII_FILE_V_00_>>
 heiko	version_parameter int32 0
 heiko	number float64 10
 heiko	number2 float64 2
 heiko	does work
 blackburn	it is the reason why ocr is not working now
 blackburn	*I guess*
 heiko	yes true
 heiko	if this depends on serialized data
@sonney2k	yes and some refactoring
 heiko	k
 heiko	i got to go to bed now, only 5 hrs last night ... :) have a good evening!
