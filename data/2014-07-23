 nick___	Hello everyone! I need some help installing the shogun toolbox. I am trying to install it through Cygwin. Can someone help me, please?
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'nightly_all'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@wiking	nick___: we used to have cygwin buildbot but now it's not working atm
@wiking	what's your current problem?
 nick___	Hello @wiking. I am running cmake from Cygwin. The installation stops at "-- Checking C++11 support for "__func__" and is not continuing.
@wiking	mmm interesteing
@wiking	that i never see happen
@wiking	what verion of shogun r u trying?
 nick___	shogun 3.2.0
 nick___	Another general question : I need to use the R interface of shogun. Is this possible through cygwin? And is shogun capable running with both 32bit and 64bit R versions?
@wiking	nick___: should
@wiking	but this was never tested
@wiking	btw you are better off trying to use the latest develop branch from the github than the release
@wiking	we are having twice a year release cycle
@wiking	and the last was somewhere around january afaik
@wiking	since then a lot of new stuff and fixes got in shogun
 nick___	ok, I can try that one too. Thank you for your help!
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 17m35s]

@besser82	HeikoS, and for the workshop on Mon?
@HeikoS	19
@HeikoS	besser82: quite nice!
@besser82	HeikoS, thoralf_, you need some help for preperations for the ws?
@besser82	HeikoS, thoralf_, I'll be in B on 27.7 @ ~17h
 thoralf_	besser82: What can you deliver? ;)
@besser82	thoralf_, what do you need?
@HeikoS	besser82: definitely
 thoralf_	besser82: Well, I'll create some slides for the hands-on, because I don't have anything yet.  This is my biggest concern.
@HeikoS	besser82: are you interested in giving a talk
@HeikoS	besser82: helping out at the hands on would also be super helpful
@HeikoS	just show people how to install shogun, how to use it, examples, etc
@HeikoS	besser82: but if you want, you could also present this years gsoc projects
@besser82	HeikoS, I'm afraid i don't have anything useful to talk about  ;)
@besser82	HeikoS, GSoc and Hands sound good, both  :D
@HeikoS	besser82: i wanted to do a little 2-5 min feature for each gsoc project
@HeikoS	besser82: but i think i can do that
@HeikoS	if you are around early to help out thats already useful
@HeikoS	and for the hands on, if you want to prepare an example, that would also be amazing, then we have two
@HeikoS	besser82: like some application how to use shogun
@besser82	HeikoS, I think I can dooo it  :D
 thoralf_	HeikoS: He'll arive at 17h in B.  I think he cannot contribute much.
@HeikoS	besser82: ok what exactly?
@besser82	HeikoS, I can be there a soon as you want me to be  ;)
@besser82	HeikoS, not sure, yet;  what do you have prepared so far?
@HeikoS	besser82: wait, so when do you arrive in berlin? sunday evening?
@HeikoS	im at the airport btw :) my flight is in 30 mins
 thoralf_	HeikoS: Hope it's not Malaysian Airline?
 thoralf_	Just in case it is: Plan some extra time
@besser82	HeikoS, yes, sunday early eve
@besser82	@Berlin HBF...
@HeikoS	besser82: well ok then hands on doesnt make sense
 thoralf_	besser82: Let's coordinate a big.  RG is only 10min away from HBF, so we might meet here and go for drinks after the hands-on.
@HeikoS	main workshop, if you are there early and help with bbq etc that would be good
@HeikoS	thoralf_: bbq plans?
@HeikoS	i really wonder whether s?ren will show up
@besser82	HeikoS, how early is early?
@HeikoS	thoralf i agree
 thoralf_	HeikoS: weather on sunday will be rainy.  Let's order pizza.
@HeikoS	besser82: thoralf what about meeting around 9-930 on Monday?
@besser82	thoralf_, yes, we can do so  ^^ But my accomodation is in Neu-K?ln...
@HeikoS	thoralf_ pizza is for lunch
 thoralf_	(I can try to cover it ;))
@besser82	HeikoS, sound good @ cbase?
@HeikoS	thoralf_: we also need diner, i think we can bbq anyways
@HeikoS	besser82: yes
@HeikoS	ok guys, lets catch up tomorrow or so, i have to go now
@HeikoS	will send some emails soon
@HeikoS	gotta prepare my talk in the plane :)
 thoralf_	Okay, we can do.  Let me check tomorrow if I can activate our bbq.

 pickle27	I usually just work on the website now, I have write access there
