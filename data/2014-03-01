 dhruv13	I have a question...
 dhruv13	in Math.h, the values for MIN_REAL_VALUE and MACHINE EPSILON are defined explicitly, rather than use the IEEE 754 values defined in float.h
 dhruv13	this is causing some unit tests which test float comparison to fail...
 dhruv13	Is it recommended that I use the values directly from float.h, or change/add CMath::* equivalents?

 kislay	thanks a lot sonney2k   :)
@sonney2k	thoralf, lisitsyn did send this around a year or so ago
@sonney2k	besser82, please send me the kill_svmlight script!
 dhruv13	okay
 thoralf	sonney2k: Didn't know that.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: You're so cool as well, because you found it first! :S

@besser82	sonney2k: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/shogun.git/plain/light-scrubber.sh  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, that does work on the extracted source or where?
@besser82	sonney2k: yes, it's for the extracted 3.2.0-release.tar.bz2
@sonney2k	besser82, perfect! Then I can add some debian magic that downloads the 3.2.0 runs the script and generates a debian.orig.tar.gz
@sonney2k	besser82, btw I have some weird build failures on powerpc now
@besser82	sonney2k: yes, sir, I can boogie  ;)
@sonney2k	https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=python-shogun&suite=sid
@besser82	sonney2k: I can haz logz, plz?
@besser82	sonney2k: you've been faster ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, I managed to build even on mips and mipsel btw :)
@sonney2k	using clang!
 kislay	ah! got another error at 85% : Linking CXX executable balanced_conditional_probability_tree
 kislay	../../../src/shogun/libshogun.so.16.1: undefined reference to `shogun::CPCA::CPCA(bool, shogun::EPCAMode, double, shogun::EPCAMemoryMode)'
@sonney2k	it needs a lot less memory!
@besser82	sonney2k: is clang allowed for debian?!?  No gcc-only policy around?!?
@sonney2k	sure I can use clang when I want - and I do need it just for these archs
@sonney2k	besser82, and note the error on ppc - it seems gcc is generating invalid assembly code
@besser82	sonney2k: nope, for me it looks like some weird stuff with numpy
@sonney2k	besser82, ?
@sonney2k	/tmp/cchNjNvK.s ...
@besser82	sonney2k: iirc that was the reason for RHEL not to ship Numpy / Scipy for the ppc releases...
@sonney2k	seems like a src file
@sonney2k	asm src I mean
@besser82	sonney2k: that's gcc trying to compile the numpy header...
@besser82	sonney2k: within SWIG-context...
@besser82	sonney2k: and that goes ***BOOM-BANG!!!*** even on RHEL 5 && 6 PPC{64}
@sonney2k	kislay, indeed that is a bug - PCA should not be available when EIGEN3 is not
@sonney2k	kislay, workaround for now is to install eigen3 !
 kislay	sure!!
@besser82	sonney2k: that was the reason for RH not to ship / support that for RHEL PPC-releases...
@besser82	sonney2k: I can ask ausil / dgilmore on monday for details about that...

 kislay	Have installed libeigen3-dev, but the same error persists.
 kislay	Is there is some problem regarding linking libshogun.a, libshogun.so ?
@besser82	kislay: did you erase the build-folder && recreated / rerun cmake after install of Eigen3?
@besser82	kislay: which version of Eigen3, btw, did you install?
@besser82	kislay: shogun need eigen3 >= 3.1.2
 kislay	I installed the one available in the ubuntu repo i.e libeigen3-dev (3.0.5-1)
@besser82	kislay: 3.0.5 is much too old
@besser82	kislay: which version of ubuntu do you use?
 kislay	ubuntu 12.04.2 precise
@besser82	kislay: is there any specific reason for you using ubuntu (lts)?
 kislay	naah!! Here most people use it , just that!
 kislay	Is eigen3 > 3.1.2 not available for ubuntu 12.04
@besser82	kislay: possibly in backports or some ppa, perhaps... I dunno...
* besser82 uses Fedora 20
 kislay	okay , let me try a bit.
@besser82	kislay: otherwise I can just recommend using Fedora 20
@besser82	kislay: There are pre-build rpm for shogun avail there, which are frequently maintained by me

 kislay	Got eigen3 3.1.2-1 at precise-backports. Then after erasing the previous build and re running make, cmake  in python interface the same problem persists :(
@besser82	kislay: delete the build-folder, recreate, re-run cmake and try again, plz...
@besser82	kislay: It basically should build fine...

@sonney2k	kislay, heh! excellent!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what kind of war? You jbossing?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you will see in the news soon
@besser82	kislay: thx! nice to hear!  :D
@besser82	lisitsyn: c'mon, tell us now!!!1111one-eleven-one
 lisitsyn	besser82: russian forces is entering ukraine :)
@besser82	lisitsyn: oh, sh*t, man!  CCCP 2.0
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah fck that
 kislay	sonney2k, one thing which is intriguing me a lot is -  I googled a lot on the error : "ImportError: libshogun.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory", and got various answers in this channels log. I managed to overcome it. but why don't you document it?
* besser82 wonders if there now some chances to get "Schlesien" back???   :-P
@besser82	kislay: that depends on the location you have libshogun.so* installed
 lisitsyn	besser82: just take that - you see how easy it is
@besser82	kislay: e.g. if you place that in system's /usr/lib/ you won't get that error;  it is mostly due to custom locations
@besser82	kislay: and if someone uses custom locations, I think the one knows what he does and know how to correctly use the linker-flags, when linking against *.so in custom location
@besser82	lisitsyn: can you lend me some tanks?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have seen some (~18) tanks moving on the road yesterday actually :D
@besser82	lisitsyn: what are you w8ing for?  Conquer them and give them to me!!! :-P

@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking I have a request: Would it be possible to let travis generate the rendered ipython notebooks? Otherwise its so hard and annoying to review pull requests with them.
@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking it would be great if it generated a temporary link with all of them in a list for checking. This way we can also detect if some of them fail. Thats very hard to do from the diff in the PR itself
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no idea if travis can keep files? generating stuff yes but this here needs some file upload...
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah upload to a temp dir on our webserver
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well - that would mean *anyone* could upload there
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  no way around this somehow?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah
@HeikoS	sonney2k: gist!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: and then print the links in the output

@sonney2k	my internet is too slow
@sonney2k	uploading new shogun release and updating the tomtom map takes just too long

@wiking	what?
@sonney2k	why can't we have BROADband
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah better do it later....
@sonney2k	wiking, debian pkg...
@wiking	HeikoS1: can u repeat taht? as i've just dropped in the internetz in tallin
@sonney2k	uploading with 50kb/s
 lambday	HeikoS1: reading your interview :D
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm from where to wherE?
 HeikoS1	wiking: travis should upload the rendered notebooks to gist and put the link in the output so that its easier to review ipython notebook, can you magic that?
@sonney2k	wiking, he wants github to upload travis notebooks
@wiking	HeikoS1: too slow job...
@sonney2k	wiking, so we would need some travis account on sgtb
@wiking	HeikoS1: i mean travis job has a soft limit of 30 mins
@wiking	HeikoS1: i reckon having travis compile python modular + compile the notebooks would be too slow
@wiking	i.e. over 30 mins
 HeikoS1	wiking: but wait
@sonney2k	already notebooks themself have a timeout of 20 mins IIRC
 HeikoS1	running the notebook just takes not so much time
* sonney2k remembers increasing it for iglesiasg and hushell
 HeikoS1	and we are compiling python already
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, it does
@sonney2k	some are *slow*
@wiking	ok so 10 min 14 sec
-!- kislay [~kislay@93.114.45.13] has joined #shogun
@wiking	this is the python modular job's build time
* lambday (without any sense) love you guys! - the interview is just awesome!
@wiking	so that'd mean that we can have around 15-18 mins time for building the notebooks... (to be on a 'safe side')
@wiking	HeikoS1: so yeah building notebooks is quite time consuming in some of the cases...
 HeikoS1	wiking: mmh, I dont know
 HeikoS1	wiking: can we trigger a buildbot to do this?
@wiking	sonney2k: is there a way to extend the command timeout on buildbot: "command timed out: 1200 seconds without output, attempting to kill"
@wiking	that's for memcheck job
@wiking	HeikoS1: it's possible of course
@wiking	HeikoS1: by using github hooks one can setup a bot that build stuff
@wiking	after a commit
@wiking	or pr
@wiking	iglesiasg: seems the fundamental task is quite popular: ))
 HeikoS1	wiking: indeed :)
 HeikoS1	wiking: would be *great* to have
 HeikoS1	in partoicular for people working on notebooks during gsoc
