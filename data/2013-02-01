 sumit_	does Shogun support simulation using Neural Networks(perceptron approach) , (as in , for various applications in financial forecasting , for instance ) ??differently put , may I contribute to shogun in this particular domain?

 blackburn	sumit_: we have only one-layer perceptron, but yes you can contribute and we welcome it

 sumit	does shogun offer support for simulation through neural networks(perceptrons,modelled for say , financial engineering for instance)??differently put,may I contribute to Shogun in this domain?

 sumit	sorry I have been asking this question time and again (the internet had not been working well :P  ,, rendering me disconnected all the time ),"Does shogun support simulation through Neural Networks (perceptron approach) ??
 sumit	put differently , may I contribute to Shogun in this domain?
 blackburn	sumit: hey there
 blackburn	sumit: we have only one-layer perceptron, but yes you can contribute and we welcome it
 sumit	ok great , I shall be devising and analysing the direction to work upon shortly and let you know

 sumit	blackburn :: so perceptron.cpp is all (seems to be) shogun has progressed in this field??Evidently, Incorporating Neural Networks into it is an arena so promising ..... also lie scopes for improvement in clustering techniques and learning methods
 blackburn	sumit: yes as shogun has been focusing on SVMs for a while
 blackburn	what do you have in mind?
 sumit	I am well versed with Neural Networks and have worked on related topics like support vector machines,,,I came to know about shogun as a machine learning toolbox a couple of days ago
 sumit	to realise that Much has been done though , much needs to be done in fields other than SVMs,so basically
 sumit	What I as of now aim for is to contribute in incorporating features that may be available in other toolbox / projects ,
 blackburn	feel free - we would welcome any contributions
 blackburn	sumit: I'll try to help you with any integration but you just have to choose what to integrate
 sumit	Sure,thanks for the support .. I am basically brushing up my knowledge on these topics,to explore what could be done,,Yes certainly blackburn....
 sumit	Simply put,
 sumit	I firstly want to
 sumit	extend the progress in
 sumit	neural networks(perceptron learning ) to say , include multi layer perceptron(feed forward neural networks)
 sumit	and say , facilties to adjust weight parameters layer by layer , and also inculcate other various models for neural networks,that may have been published earlier and appreciated
 sumit	All I need is a day or two so that I can come out with something that is amiable to work upon,,,
 sumit	*amicable
 blackburn	you are not in hurry I guess :)
 sumit	No blackburn :)
 sumit	But the keyboard ,,Aargh!...anyways never mind :)
 sumit	I basically have come across a book so comprehensive on neural networks , touches every topic indispensible on neural networks
 sumit	I am just imbibing insight on Adaline,Madaline,back propagation,counter propagation,hopfield networks and a few more, let me see how can they be transformed into a piece of code,I shall definitely come up with something fruitful very soon
 blackburn	most (if not all) of these methods are already implemented I expect
 sumit	Yes , the primitive ones though , anyways I may also work on topics apart from Neural Networks
 blackburn	what is your motivation? :)
 sumit	I has always been interested to work on statistics / machine learning analysis.Besides,I realize this as an opportunity towards GsoC 2013
 blackburn	I see - I just wanted to recommend you to work on something you really like or it could get tough
 sumit	good :) so let me shortly come up with what I could work upon,I ll keep you posted about it!thanks :)

 n4nd0	hello hello guys
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so do you think the program draft is looking ok enough to send it around in the mailing list?
