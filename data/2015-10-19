@sonney2k	lisitsyn, was wiking ever awake when you were?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah we catched up a few times
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, around when?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: closer to 'our' morning actually
* sonney2k needs chocolate
 lisitsyn	heh
@sonney2k	nothing in the whole #&%*YfhDF house
@sonney2k	I guess I could eat 1kg of it
 lisitsyn	hehe
@sonney2k	jsut now
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: is he in singapore now? I have no idea to be honest
 lisitsyn	I guess so..
@sonney2k	yeah
 lisitsyn	I remember we chatting around 1-3 pm CET
 lisitsyn	so I guess if you want to catch up you gotta try tomorrow heh
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, will try
@sonney2k	but I don't actually recall how to write c++ code ;)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: is it about license switch?
@sonney2k	yeah
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ask me I do that for living haha
 lisitsyn	why C++?
@sonney2k	he wanted it badly but IMHO didn't really spent time pushing it
 lisitsyn	want to write some code?
@sonney2k	well C/C++ all the same to me
@sonney2k	shogun wise you mean
@sonney2k	nah I am so java polluted now
 lisitsyn	yeah I mean why bother about C++
@sonney2k	I leak memory and write code w/o thinking
@sonney2k	well shogun!~
@sonney2k	or what do you program
@sonney2k	and which $LANG?
 lisitsyn	well you know shogun is really slow
 lisitsyn	if you're asking about me I am doing C++ and python
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, shogun & slow you mean development currently?
@sonney2k	or what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes basically no real development
 lisitsyn	well it is actually good if we were satisfied
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I am cleaning my fish tank ATM so I am not quick
 lisitsyn	but everyone has ideas and we don't move
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh well I thought heiko gave up?
 lisitsyn	they sum to zero
@sonney2k	well I guess no one has time right?
@sonney2k	or everyone wants to do something different :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so you use scikits now or what?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and what would you improve if you had the time?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sorry, back
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I wouldn't say its about time
 lisitsyn	some kind of passion I'd say
@sonney2k	yeah if you don't use it why do it...
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what do you use now?
 lisitsyn	I am doing some neural nets now (fuuu)
 lisitsyn	with in-house stuff
 lisitsyn	big company has their own tools
 lisitsyn	but I used shogun a few times
 lisitsyn	we need to improve how we handle data and modularize
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, handle data as in?
 lisitsyn	well lacks some magic
 lisitsyn	have you used vw?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, never
 lisitsyn	it has strict format but you can do basically anything
 lisitsyn	there is no such thing as dense features or sparse features in real life
 lisitsyn	they are always mixed together
@sonney2k	with the size of data I had to deal with I always had to write the basic i/o from scratch...
@sonney2k	well I manually de-mixed the features back in the days
 lisitsyn	yeah
@sonney2k	but regarding modularize
 lisitsyn	but things speed up
 lisitsyn	and you can't spend your time doing that
@sonney2k	I see that this could in principle be done for libshogun / c++
@sonney2k	but I don't see it for *any* interface
@sonney2k	at least not with swig
 lisitsyn	have you seen my mail?
 lisitsyn	I had some solution
@sonney2k	nah I don't read email
 lisitsyn	pretty ugly..
 lisitsyn	quite similar to static
@sonney2k	I am only scanning things...
 lisitsyn	well if you have parameter just set it with set("parameter", 3);
 lisitsyn	like that
 lisitsyn	or other thing, tags
 lisitsyn	like you have tags for parameters
@sonney2k	yeah sounds like static
 lisitsyn	tag = kernel.parameter("width");
 lisitsyn	kernel.set(tag, 3.0);
 lisitsyn	this would work in swig
@sonney2k	ahh you are talking about this still being wrapped in swig
 lisitsyn	yes
@sonney2k	I see
 lisitsyn	w/o swig doesn't make sense
@sonney2k	but still you would need to expose the whole object .h tree to swig
@sonney2k	and you cannot modularize that
 lisitsyn	no, you can avoid that
@sonney2k	how?
 lisitsyn	you can expose only basic objects
 lisitsyn	classifier, kernel, etc
 lisitsyn	and call kernel("gaussian")
@sonney2k	you would need to feed any object into another
 lisitsyn	well that's the limitation, you would have to use only base classes
 lisitsyn	no crazy relationship between two really different modules
@sonney2k	could you please make an example for kernel and features
@sonney2k	so I know how it could work?
 lisitsyn	hmm
 lisitsyn	well, features are base classes
 lisitsyn	features = shogun.DenseFeatures would stay I guess
 lisitsyn	as for kernel you just do
 lisitsyn	kernel = shogun.kernel("gaussian")
 lisitsyn	kernel.init(features, features)
 lisitsyn	kernel.set("width", 10.0)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: most checks would go to runtime then
 lisitsyn	but I don't see any need to expose .h of plugins this way
 lisitsyn	classifier = shogun.classifier("liblinear")
 lisitsyn	classifier.train(kernel)
@sonney2k	well ok features make up 50% of all swig wrapped code
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I would actually drop features..
 lisitsyn	and write adapters to use pandas dataframe
 lisitsyn	spark rdd
 lisitsyn	and stuff like that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so you would have a classifier
@sonney2k	sure you can init is just by some 'ascii' name
 lisitsyn	yes
@sonney2k	so you would just have a stand alone classifier module
 lisitsyn	yeah it would be easier to write/load plugins then
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am also obsessed by other thing
@sonney2k	but how do classifiers underneath work with features w/o knowing about e.g. CDenseFeatures?
 lisitsyn	why?
 lisitsyn	it knows about dense features
 lisitsyn	they would have to be in the base shogun
 lisitsyn	it doesn't know about gaussian kernel
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, OK
 lisitsyn	or oligowdstringkernelwhatever
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am obsessed about having shogun.classifier('some_matlab_classifier_from_fancy_researcher')
@sonney2k	but then kernelmachines would need to know about kernels right?
 lisitsyn	yes about base class, CKernel
@sonney2k	ok makes sense
@sonney2k	so basically you modularize out the machine part right?
 lisitsyn	we would just move all the concrete kernels
 lisitsyn	concrete machines
 lisitsyn	and stuff like that
 lisitsyn	this would be a step
@sonney2k	this sounds very doable
 lisitsyn	yeah probably
 lisitsyn	but this string-based thing makes me cry and I see no other way
 lisitsyn	when it comes to something dynamic all you have is some string
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah even enums would make it non-dynamic
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: and we should employ your COFFIN much more
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: recently I realized nobody use that approach for neural nets
 lisitsyn	although it is quite natural
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so if I get it right you would have a dynamic runtime open for the classifier
 lisitsyn	yes
@sonney2k	and this way you can just have ton's of .so's hanging around
@sonney2k	and nice and modular and you only need the libshogun core installed
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and if you want to use more of shogun's helper stuff linalg etc?
 lisitsyn	not sure
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am not sure anybody needs it being exposed via swig
 lisitsyn	all major langs have their own linalg
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well not swig but from the c++ side
@sonney2k	you would still need to link against that part
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	true
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and yes about COFFIN... if I use stuff I only do it linearly and the coffin way
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it is a very good idea, essentially employing principle of limiting the interface
 lisitsyn	like you don't need all the stuff so don't ask for that broad interface
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, thanks ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the one thing that feels hard with c++ to me is I have to use my brain to not leak
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I really cannot do that (by default)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ah yes that's another thing to change
 lisitsyn	I'd like to not see any raw pointer in shogun
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you know it is quite natural for modern C++ to use unique and shared pointer semantics
 lisitsyn	*sometimes* weak
 lisitsyn	but that's all to not think a lot
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, alright and how do we get it in then?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, this is really a blocker to me. the modularization part sounds rather easy to do and could even be done in a compatible way in *addition* to what we have now until it is funcitonal
@wiking	ho
@sonney2k	wiking, hey - lets chew bubble gum and kick ass...
@sonney2k	wiking, well I guess I will have to chew it for you :P
@sonney2k	wiking, so where the heck is the license thing?!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's true
 lisitsyn	we can start right away heh
 lisitsyn	no idea what blocks me
@wiking	:>>>>
@wiking	with one of the website deploys
@wiking	that thing got wiped out
@wiking	and as much as i wanted couldnt find any copy of it anywhere
 lisitsyn	lol
@wiking	and i have no idea what i put on that page :D
@wiking	i mean text wise
@sonney2k	wiking, and I guess no idea who signed it either?
@sonney2k	wiking, man!
@sonney2k	wiking, doesn't sound like you pushed very hard didn't you?
@wiking	nono
@wiking	that i know
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	lets do that once again lool
@wiking	hahaha you think of me too little ;)
@wiking	http://maeth.com/shogun_licensing_stats.php
@wiking	that's in a db table
 lisitsyn	ah
@wiking	i just need the stupid static page
 lisitsyn	so you have a list of signers
 lisitsyn	but no text
@wiking	with one webform in it
 lisitsyn	that's funny
@wiking	i just need to recover the webform basically
@wiking	that'll send some POST params to a php script
@wiking	that'll update this table
@wiking	so stop being cocky and help me with the content of the webform :)
@sonney2k	wiking, didn't you send out an emal to everyone?
@sonney2k	I mean that content should be in everyones inbox
@wiking	yeah partly in some way yes
@sonney2k	wiking, do you remember the sender
 lisitsyn	Dear root,
 lisitsyn	We are contacting you as You are one of the developers who has been committing to Shogun machine learning toolbox in the past.
 lisitsyn	like that?
 lisitsyn	wiking: we your inbox
 lisitsyn	see
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, subject?
 lisitsyn	Shogun Licensing
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, found ...
@sonney2k	wiking, was the webform on shogun-toolbox.org's servers?
@sonney2k	because the url I got was
@sonney2k	wiking, http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/license/
@wiking	yes
@sonney2k	wiking, well we have (or had) backups
@sonney2k	wiking, but probably not dating back 2 years
* sonney2k Zzzzz
