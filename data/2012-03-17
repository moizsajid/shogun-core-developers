 RagnarX	Hello, world !
 n4nd0	RagnarX: hi there!
 RagnarX	n4nd0: how are you? :)
 n4nd0	RagnarX: I am fine, what about you?
 RagnarX	I'm fine ! :D
 RagnarX	I'm a student and I have an idea which is not in the idea page ^^'
 n4nd0	cool, I am a student too so I am not exactly the person you should propose it too
 n4nd0	but anyway, what is your idea about? maybe I can suggest you something ;)
 RagnarX	It's about using OpenCL for Machine Learning :p
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I have no experience with OpenCL :(
 RagnarX	yes it's kind of special :p
 n4nd0	I've heard of it of course, but nothing more than that
 RagnarX	:p
 RagnarX	where are you from?
 n4nd0	what do you think it could be used for in ml?
 n4nd0	I am from Spain, what about you?
 RagnarX	France ^^
 RagnarX	to speed up machine learning :p
 RagnarX	I am a developer for a linear algebra library on OpenCL and started a MultiLayer Perceptron project using OpenCL, and from the test i did there was nice speed improvements
 n4nd0	we use blas in shogun for linear algebra stuff
 n4nd0	do you have any idea aobout comparisons between linear algebra done on OpenCL and blas?
 RagnarX	It mostly depends on the hardware :p but it is about 10 to 15 folds
 RagnarX	http://viennacl.sourceforge.net/viennacl-benchmarks.html
 RagnarX	I think the CPU benchmarks were done using blas
 n4nd0	oh it looks like really good performance then
 RagnarX	yes :p
 RagnarX	are you a shogun developer?
 n4nd0	I have done some contributions
 RagnarX	I see ^^
 RagnarX	it looks like a cool project
 n4nd0	:) yes I think it is indeed
 RagnarX	and gsoc always bring a lot of new developers
 RagnarX	:p
 n4nd0	haha of course
 n4nd0	so I think that you could try asking soeren about your idea
 n4nd0	he is normally around here so he may answer you at any moment
 RagnarX	Haha okay :p
 RagnarX	isn't he sleeping right now?
 RagnarX	Well maybe he's not an European :p
 n4nd0	oh sorry, I meant maybe not precisely now but if you come around tomorrow or sth like that
 RagnarX	Yes I probably will :)
 n4nd0	in any case, you might want to use email
 RagnarX	Yes, I've just registered to the mailing list :p
 n4nd0	good
 RagnarX	i've also cloned the repository, but it is kinda big :p
 n4nd0	lot of work into there!
 n4nd0	:)
 RagnarX	yep
 RagnarX	:p
 RagnarX	I think i'll send a mail on the list to describe my idea ^^
 n4nd0	that's probably a good idea

 n4nd0	RagnarX: I have just made a quick search in the chat logs and found that at least they have commented the OpenCL topic a couple of times
 n4nd0	RagnarX: maybe you want to check about it
 RagnarX	haha okay
 RagnarX	I think i'll firstly go to bed :p
 RagnarX	I have sent the mail today, and will probably read the logs tomorrow :p
 RagnarX	when was it?
 n4nd0	google it
 n4nd0	opencl site:shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs will tell you about it ;)

 aang	Hi
 n4nd0	aang: hey!
 aang	Hi.. I am interested in contributing to shogun this year in GSoC
 aang	Is there any qualification task?
 n4nd0	great, do you have any idea in mind?
 aang	I am familiar with the machine learning algorithms
 aang	and i wish to contribute in your idea of Integrating Existing and Implementing New Machine Learning Algorithms in shogun
 n4nd0	aang: with qualification you mean something like a contribution to do before applying to GSoC?
 aang	Yes.
 n4nd0	aang: I think that the page will be updated soon with info about that
 aang	Ok.
 n4nd0	have to go now, bye
 aang	Which all projects are in your priority list this year?
 aang	Ok, catch you later !!
 n4nd0	all the ones that appear in the ideas page are stuff that would be interesting to have

-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.179.129] has joined #shogun
 varagrawal	I wanted to join in the Shogun toolkit Open source project
 varagrawal	I have read your list of ideas page for GSoC 2012
 n4nd0	hi
 varagrawal	and being an undergrad with some basic knowledge of Machine Learning
 n4nd0	varagrawal: good, what idea did you find appealing?
 varagrawal	I was thinking I could help with either Olivier Chapelles fast newton based SVM solver
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	do you have experience with shogun? I mean if you have used it before
 wiking	n4nd0: :> you should be a mentor ;)
 n4nd0	wiking: haha I don't think so :)
 wiking	well u are all the time guiding possible gsocers here, so why not ;P

 varagrawal	Hey
 wiking	hihi
 varagrawal	sorry
 n4nd0	but it is good to help people
 n4nd0	varagrawal: np
 varagrawal	net got disconnected
 varagrawal	the other idea was the implementation of Gaussian processes and regression techniques
 n4nd0	varagrawal: cool, those ideas look nice
 n4nd0	varagrawal: so have you used shogun before for sth?
 varagrawal	I haven't used shogun, but I have used octave
 wiking	varagrawal: it'd be nice that u start something with shogun before trying to apply for a gsoc project ...
 varagrawal	I am starting to port those octave codes to shogun and try and achieve similar functionality
 wiking	so at least check out the latest code
 n4nd0	exactly
 wiking	and try to implement something in it
 n4nd0	varagrawal: have you already forked the repo?
 wiking	since you'll have do most of the work in c/c++
 varagrawal	Yeah, I have a DBMS project, where I try to guess a good branch of study for a person
 varagrawal	depending on their rank in the entrance exam
 varagrawal	I was thinking of using Shogun for that with the KNN algo most probably
 n4nd0	ok
 varagrawal	I will check out the code now
 n4nd0	but you might want you check out shogun code from the repo
 varagrawal	Yes
 varagrawal	Am cloning it now..
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	so maybe it is a good idea to try out some of the examples and get used to the structure of the project
 varagrawal	aww net went again....
 varagrawal	I'll do that
 n4nd0	:)
 varagrawal	Ok, thanks a lot for the suggestions :D
 n4nd0	varagrawal: you're welcome
 varagrawal	I'll sit now and get back to you guys tomorrow morning fine?
 n4nd0	sure
 varagrawal	Thank you :)

 wiking	n4nd0: hehehe just starting to sketch up the classes
 wiking	blackburn: yoyo man
 wiking	blackburn: your fucking email made a mess here in the channel :)))
 n4nd0	haha :)
 blackburn	wiking: which one?
 wiking	blackburn: gsoc...now there's heaps of people coming to talk about various gsoc projects ;)
 blackburn	oh well we can't keep it in secret
 wiking	:P
 n4nd0	so what do you think guys about the number of slots?
 n4nd0	is it likely to get those 9 you talked about yesterday?
 wiking	it's amazing that VLC did not get a spot in gsoc this year :(
 n4nd0	I didn't know about that
 n4nd0	is there also a list of rejected orgs?
 wiking	i don't think so
 wiking	i've just seen it in twitter
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	think of it this way ... we are contributing to sth more important than VLC :P
 wiking	comeoooon
 wiking	vlc is essential we can all agree
 n4nd0	haha just kidding
 n4nd0	different projects indeed
 n4nd0	wiking: about this deep learning, is it very good?
 wiking	yep
 n4nd0	what is the main idea with it?
 wiking	since it's unsupervised
 wiking	and get's very good results
 wiking	well it's a neural net
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I've used neural nets in supervised learning but nothing further than that
 n4nd0	it is always cool to hear from new stuff
 wiking	well the mentioned theano toolbox is good enough
 wiking	it even has cuda backend...
 blackburn	I think we can get 7-8 at least
 blackburn	cause we have reached success with 5 slots
 blackburn	but 9 would be wonderful
 n4nd0	let's keep fingers crossed
 n4nd0	is that also announced as well?
 n4nd0	or just when applications are submitted and the students are notified?
 blackburn	we will be notified how many slots we have got a little bit later

 puffin444	Okay. I'll try to contact him via email. Would it help my case if I tried to fix a minor bug in Shogun?

 PhilTillet	Hello hello
 blackburn	hi
 PhilTillet	I have seen that it was necessary to submit a little pull request for Shogun ... :p How "small" does it have to be?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: well..
 blackburn	it is not about size I think
 PhilTillet	The other problem is that I don't really understand the "Issues" section on the github, to be honest
 blackburn	it is not highly relevant, it is ok
 blackburn	I've got not much time to keep it updated
 PhilTillet	oh ok :p
 PhilTillet	So i should rather browse code and see "what i can do" ? :p
 blackburn	yeah rather do that
 blackburn	or ask me/soeren
 PhilTillet	okay :p
 PhilTillet	Yes, the source code is rather big. I think i wouldn't be against having some pointers
 blackburn	do you know any kernel that is not implemented in shogun?
 PhilTillet	Well, my field is more Neural Networks / Optimization than SVM
 PhilTillet	According to the website, conjugate gradient is not implemented, if I remember well
 PhilTillet	And BFGS either
 blackburn	well it could turn as a lot of work?
 PhilTillet	Hmmm, well. It is something I have already done in C++ (even though I think my L-BFGS was buggy :p) ; it mostly depends on, well, how to interface it
 PhilTillet	concretely, what should be minimized
 PhilTillet	if it is just a functor which can return the value of a function and a gradient, it shouldn't be long
 blackburn	can't you adapt it for some svm?
 PhilTillet	Hmmm
 PhilTillet	I think i would need to put myself up to date with SVM, but I could try
 blackburn	I still do not know even my opinion on implementing something NN here
 PhilTillet	well, it's true that SVM are very efficient, and most of the time better than NN
 PhilTillet	well at least MLP
 blackburn	it is not about efficiency - we've got a pretty long list of ideas
 PhilTillet	And i think it would be indeed hard to implement CG ... I mean i'd have to first review all the architecture of SVMs in Shogun ... hmm ...
 blackburn	then no need to do that
 blackburn	our req about small patch is just a kind of a 'filter'
 blackburn	cause we are probably going to receive >50 (~70 last year) proposals
 PhilTillet	Got it :)
 blackburn	at least it makes things more fair
 PhilTillet	Well as far as I know Shogun implements linear, gaussian, sigmoid kernel
 blackburn	i.e. chances we pick some student who just wrote good proposal and too lame with any development are pretty low then
 blackburn	uh
 PhilTillet	(and others)
 blackburn	we have pretty many kernels here
 PhilTillet	I know :p
 PhilTillet	Wanted to tell that these 3 are the only kernels I know
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	btw why do you want to work only on OpenCL?
 PhilTillet	well, I don't want to work only on OpenCL
 blackburn	did you found any other ideas interesting?
 blackburn	as I said before we don't mind anything related to such things but we are pretty tight with slots
 PhilTillet	the point is that I have "a lot" of experience using OpenCL because I have already done some projects on it and quite a bit of Linear Algebra on it too, and as of now no machine learning library use OpenCL so ... :) but the "Built generic multiclass learning framework" idea seems cool too
 blackburn	aha I see
 blackburn	ok I just got how can we solve it
 blackburn	while you have a lot of experience with OpenCL you may help us with some basic operations here
 blackburn	like dot product etc
 PhilTillet	yep
 blackburn	but mainly you may work on something different
 PhilTillet	I see :p
 blackburn	this is the case if we won't receive much slots
 PhilTillet	Well, the point is that i'm also a contributor to an OpenCL linear algebra library
 PhilTillet	which already implements dot product ...
 blackburn	then probably it won't take much time for you
 PhilTillet	yes, hope so :)
 PhilTillet	but why not using already existing code?
 blackburn	I did not say you can't use that code ;)
 PhilTillet	haha :p
 blackburn	depends on license though
 PhilTillet	is MIT license okay?
 blackburn	probably
 blackburn	iirc we can integrate mit code in gpl project
 PhilTillet	yes I think too, just have to be careful about how to integrate the license
 PhilTillet	I'll ask to the project leader of that library :)
 blackburn	sure
 PhilTillet	well, to get back to that generic multiclass learning framework
 PhilTillet	would it be about making some generic code that would map any binary classifier to multiclass ?
 blackburn	there is such code already done by me recently
 blackburn	probably main thing here would be to implement ECOC and some tree learning stuff
 PhilTillet	I see
 PhilTillet	there seems to be already a paper and some matlab code
 blackburn	yes
 PhilTillet	This will involve some generic programming right?
