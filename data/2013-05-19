 shogun-notifier-	shogun: use shoguns prng in liblinear
@sonney2k	yay!
@sonney2k	travis is happy
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well of course again your isomap failed and gp's have this 1e-16 deviation
@lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	but the rest is back to normal
@lisitsyn	disabling it
@sonney2k	so buildbot should be happy too
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do we have a thing to ignore unit tests?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, look at how I did this - grep -i disabled in the tests
@lisitsyn	gut

 van51	sonney2k: which one was the example that you assigned to HeikoS to rewrite?
@sonney2k	van51, ohh indeed the productkernel one should fail now too
@sonney2k	van51, errm luck it up in the issues list
 van51	ok

 votjakovr	Hi everyone:) I've just made a PR.
@sonney2k	votjakovr, about?
* sonney2k looks
 votjakovr	sonney2k: I've fixed and improved some parts of GP regression
@sonney2k	votjakovr, sound good
@sonney2k	votjakovr, can one with eigen use things like x/=sigma?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, I will give some feedback but I am not gp expert
@sonney2k	general feedback that is
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Do you mean where x - vector and sigma - scalar?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: warum nicht
@sonney2k	votjakovr, yes or matrix
@sonney2k	x matrix
 votjakovr	sure
@sonney2k	votjakovr, massive patch
@sonney2k	it looks like much much reduced code size
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: even if you want to divide each column by some vector coeff-wise
 votjakovr	sonney2: yeah, I tried to simplify existing code
@lisitsyn	bus time!
-!- lisitsyn [~blackburn@188-122-243-31.clients.tlt.100megabit.ru] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	votjakovr, looks brilliant - it is too big to see real issues
@sonney2k	but you did add tests comparing things agains GPML reference so I am very OK with merging
@sonney2k	votjakovr, just do the few minor comments I had and thanks a lot
 votjakovr	sonney2k: it's big, because bugs caused big fixes
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Ok, i will fix code style and will add CMath::sq(), where it needs.

 votjakovr	foulwall: Hi, sounds good. I'd like to look at it, how can i do it?
 foulwall	sonney2k: I've checked out shogun-data, and which data file should I used in demo?
 foulwall	HI votjakovr
 foulwall	votjakovr: I'm not sure the site is deployed or not, wait me a minute and I'll deploy it on my server.
 votjakovr	foulwall: Ok, thanks) I'm very interested in GP, so I'm very interested to look at GP demo too :)
 foulwall	votjakovr: huh, the server was just rebuilt this morning and I have to recompile the shogun...

 mikhailBelous	Anybody here?
 foulwall	any around?
 votjakovr	Yep :)
 foulwall	votjakovr: I got something wrong compiling when compiling shogun...
 foulwall	make -C shogun
 foulwall	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/foulwall/shogun/src/shogun'
 foulwall	Compiling lib/tapkee/tapkee_shogun.cpp.o
 foulwall	c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
 foulwall	Please submit a full bug report,
 foulwall	with preprocessed source if appropriate.
 foulwall	See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.6/README.Bugs> for instructions.
 foulwall	make[1]: *** [lib/tapkee/tapkee_shogun.cpp.o] Error 4
 foulwall	make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/foulwall/shogun/src/shogun'
 votjakovr	foulwall: Wow
 mikhailBelous	Can you suggest some contribution for your project?
 votjakovr	foulwall: And doesn't 'make clean' help?
 foulwall	votjakovr: building on ubuntu 12.04 LTS amd64, first time build
 foulwall	votjakovr: try again.
 votjakovr	foulwall: very strange...
 foulwall	got stuck on tapkee
 votjakovr	mikhailBelous: Hi, I think you can choose something interesting for you from https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?&state=open
 mikhailBelous	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1103
 mikhailBelous	What does it mean?
 votjakovr	foulwall: Is that possible to compile with another compiler (with clang for example)?
 foulwall	votjakovr: I'll have a try
 votjakovr	foulwall: But I think we should ask lisitsyn about that, i think he might know something about that
 votjakovr	mikhailBelous: It's a cleanup task. get_first_kernel and get_last_kernel methods are no longer required, so this issue is about removing them.
 foulwall	votjakovr: I'll ask him on mail list.
 foulwall	votjakovr: got stuck again after make clean
 votjakovr	foulwall: Sorry, but i have no idea, why does it happen.
 foulwall	votjakovr: that's all right, I'm recompiling with clang.

@sonney2k	3-4gb
@sonney2k	for swig & octave-modular
@sonney2k	(that's the biggest)
@sonney2k	votjakovr, libshogun is just a few 100 mb / cheap

 votjakovr	sonney2k: Good :)
 pickle27	sonney2k: looks like I missed another change in the base class, taking a look at this now
 van51	sonney2k: I uncommented the comments you made in  regression_gaussian_process_product.cpp and typed make tests and the test passes as ok.. what am I missing?
@sonney2k	van51, the example or the tests?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, we have to change / fix the gp example
@sonney2k	votjakovr, if we cannot get 100% reproducible results we have to return something that we can rely on
@sonney2k	pickle27, yeah we moved that function to CLabelFactory
@sonney2k	pickle27, so just do CLabelFactory::to_multiclass
@sonney2k	now
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay thanks I was just looking into this
 van51	sonney2k: I uncommented from the example
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Do you mean about python_modular example?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, yeah the one that we get the buildbot failure all the time
@sonney2k	pickle27, please do a quick PR
 pickle27	will do
 pickle27	I need to upstream merge to get the label factory
@sonney2k	van51, and then ? did you run make again and ran the example?
 van51	sonney2k: I uncommented that, ran make in src and make install and then make tests
@sonney2k	van51, hmmh - go to ../examples/undocumented/libshogun
@sonney2k	run make clean
@sonney2k	make there
@sonney2k	and then run this particular example
 pickle27	sonney2k: I'm just checking that it runs on my system before I make a pr
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Ok, I'll try to fix it, but not today. So maybe it's better to temporally disable this test?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, I've already messed around in this I will upload something tonight then but I think you can do better
@sonney2k	votjakovr, so just have a look tomorrow
@sonney2k	pickle27, so?
 pickle27	I'll make a PR but the tests didn't build for me because of an error CMath init random
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay I made a PR
@sonney2k	pickle27, do the PR then clean your repo (git clean -dfx will erase everything not in git) and rebuild again
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay
 pickle27	sonney2k: I hope the PR is okay I have the merge commit so I'm not sure how that will affect thinigs
@sonney2k	pickle27, ohh your PR is messed up - you need to do a git pull --rebase
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay
@sonney2k	so now all our changes are on top of your LabelFactory patch
@sonney2k	but it should be the other way round

 mikhailBelous1	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/873
 mikhailBelous1	Tell me what interface my coloring algorithm should have?
@sonney2k	pickle27, the rpm1 buildbot doesn't have eigen3 so we need some do nothing in the example
@sonney2k	pickle27, let me just do it
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay
 pickle27	sonney2k: like an ifdef HAVE_EIGEN3 at the top?
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :develop * 294091b / examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_lda.cpp: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/294091bee2d76b69351f92829c7ed614176c9d4d
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: do nothing for lda when eigen3 is unavailable
@sonney2k	pickle27, like this ^
@sonney2k	mikhailBelous1, Heiko is currently away
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay yeah that makes sense
@sonney2k	pickle27, lib/config.h contains all the defines like HAVE_*
@sonney2k	so we need to include that before testing for anything
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay
@sonney2k	it is usually included in SGObject (or derived class)
@sonney2k	so one hardly notices
 pickle27	sonney2k: oh okay
@sonney2k	pickle27, ohh and about the cyg1 buildbot - for some reason it fails on configure every now and then - but the error there doesn't make any sense
@sonney2k	pickle27, this one http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/850/steps/configure/logs/stdio
 pickle27	sonney2k: yeah I had a look when it failed but it didn't make any sense
 pickle27	sonney2k: good to know though
@sonney2k	pickle27, for example here it just worked http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/848/steps/configure/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	with same mersenne exponent 19937...
 pickle27	sonney2k: weird
@sonney2k	van51, does the example fail now?
 shogun-buildbot	build #562 of rpm1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/rpm1%20-%20libshogun/builds/562
 van51	sonney2k: yea, I took a closer look at the includes and saw I was missing the nlopt library
 van51	so it wasn't doing anything
@sonney2k	ahh ok!
 van51	so now I'm out of tasks :P
 van51	I was thinking of implementing the copy constructor of CombinedFeatures
 van51	and then maybe read about the GSoC project I had made a proposal for
