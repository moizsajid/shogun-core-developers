 n4nd0	sonney2k: the only issue I see is that there might be too little time for tutorials
 n4nd0	sonney2k: maybe we could take some time from posters spotlight??
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well 3 tutorials is quite a lot no?
 n4nd0	mmm so better 2 tutorial sessions?
 n4nd0	or did you mean that 3 tutorials per session is too much?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we have one ML tutorial aka keynote from gunnar
@sonney2k	plus 3 tutorials
@sonney2k	I don't understand why you complain?
@sonney2k	that is a lot already...
 n4nd0	hehe not complaining
@sonney2k	usually one has like 1 or 2 not 4 :)
 n4nd0	I am not sure if you mean the tutorial sessions or the tutorials
 n4nd0	I mean
 n4nd0	for example in the second session in the schedule
 n4nd0	there are written three different tutorials!
 n4nd0	I am not sure if that should be a slot of 45min for those three or?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't understand what you mean
 n4nd0	mmm ok,let me explain
 n4nd0	see the first page?
 n4nd0	there are 9 ideas for different tutorials written in there
 n4nd0	in the schedule there are 3 sessions of 45min each for tutorials
 n4nd0	not taking into account the keynote
@sonney2k	so?
 n4nd0	if the first tutorial lasts for 45 min as it is currently in the schedule
@sonney2k	I still don't get the point
 n4nd0	then we have two sessions of 45min
 n4nd0	1h30m for 8 tutorials
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	we do just 3 tutorials not 8
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	ok then, 3 tutorials of 45 min each
 n4nd0	only left to decide which ones will be ;)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: agree?
@sonney2k	not necessarily 45 minutes each
@sonney2k	some where 30mins/each IIRC
@sonney2k	just look at the last page
 n4nd0	yep
@sonney2k	I've put time slots for them
 n4nd0	45min 45min and 30min
@sonney2k	but yes topic needs to be decided
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	ook
 n4nd0	so I am going to write on the webpage the draft and will let you and Chris know to revise
@sonney2k	and we will certainly adjust the schedule if we get lots of contributions from the outside
@sonney2k	thanks
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but still, poster spotlights 30 min?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, say 10 posters 3 mins each etc?
 n4nd0	just to ensure
 n4nd0	poster sportlight would be sth where the poster author presents quickly his/her poster
 n4nd0	spotlight* haha
 n4nd0	no sport

 sonne|work	n4nd0: sorry I totally forget that you did not attend hundreds of workshops/conferences

 cronor	Hi folks, I have a question for the infinite wisdom regarding practical applications in this channel: What cross validation grids do you use? Do you base it on log10, e.g. 10^-3, 10^-2, 10^-1, etc or do you use other grids?
 cronor	E.g. gaussian kernel width, SVM or KRR regulariation parameter
 cronor	r
 blackburn	hah hi cronor, I used log10 to estimate the order and then some guess to improve that
 blackburn	never used other grids
 cronor	ok
