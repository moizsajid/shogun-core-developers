@sonney2k	wiking, we have a real soname for libshogun - I guess it is just not passed through for osx
@sonney2k	wiking, it is in .config - LIBSHOGUN_SONAME
 wiking	sonney2k: yes
 wiking	sonney2k: i've more or less fixed this now in ./configure for darwin
 wiking	but why dont we maintain a separate major/minor version number for libshogun
 wiking	sonney2k: check this report: http://categorizer.tmit.bme.hu/~wiking/shogun.sa/2012-11-06-2/report-jmESH9.html#EndPath
 wiking	the problem is that SG_ERROR currently it seems doesn't kill the function
 wiking	as after 2501 condition being true it continues to execute

@sonney2k	wiking, what does a minor version help?
@sonney2k	we maintain a the soname (major) but no further minor
@sonney2k	wiking, it raises an exception....
 wiking	sonney2k: well just to be able to say that whether a the new library is at all compatible with the prev one
 wiking	this way we are never compatible...
@sonney2k	shogun/io/SGIO.cpp
@sonney2k	            case MSG_ERROR:
@sonney2k	            case MSG_CRITICAL:
@sonney2k	            case MSG_ALERT:
@sonney2k	            case MSG_EMERGENCY:
@sonney2k	                if (sg_print_error)
@sonney2k	                    sg_print_error(target, str);
@sonney2k	                throw ShogunException(str);
@sonney2k	                break;
 wiking	as we always interate the major number by one
 wiking	yes i saw that
@sonney2k	so the program will always exit
@sonney2k	except if you can somehow handle the situation
 wiking	but i guess then scan-build has a bug or something
 wiking	as it doesn't quit on an SG_ERROR
@sonney2k	wiking, we only increase the major number if we do incompatible changes
 wiking	and then how do you show at all change?
 wiking	i.e. that's minor number should stand for...
@sonney2k	yeah - looks like it doesn't find the throw()
@sonney2k	wiking, well you could check if some some exit(0) would help it...
@sonney2k	though of course that is not an option when sb is working in python_modular
@sonney2k	he just wants to get back to the python console
@sonney2k	wiking, yes but that is not part of the SONAME
@sonney2k	the SONAME should stay the same
@sonney2k	otherwise it marks that the thing is not compatible
@sonney2k	wiking, note the difference between LIBSHOGUNSO and LIBSHOGUNVER
@sonney2k	VER has the full version like libshogun.so.13.2
@sonney2k	SO only libshogun.so.13
 wiking	yeps
 wiking	that's why i did this patch
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/118d15bc1c7d49311d54c53304dd3014b705b970
@sonney2k	connection is slow...
@sonney2k	wiking, on linux systems this is handled differently
 wiking	yep i know
@sonney2k	it is just the filename that is marking the major.minor version
 wiking	yes
 wiking	i know
 wiking	:)
@sonney2k	so then all good now
@sonney2k	wiking, correct?
 wiking	2.0.1 release should be 12.1 no?
@sonney2k	no
 wiking	is there so big api changes?
@sonney2k	libshogun has a different version than shogun's
@sonney2k	wiking, sure
 wiking	yesh i know
 wiking	but still
 wiking	2.0 had 12.0 as libshogun
 wiking	that's why i'm saying
@sonney2k	read README.soname
@sonney2k	in shogun/src
 wiking	2.0.1 as a bugfixing release
 wiking	should be 12.1
@sonney2k	no we have had incompatible changes
@sonney2k	according to README.soname
 wiking	then shouldn't we mark it at least a 2.1 release
@sonney2k	yes now we should
 wiking	i mean according to most FOSS project
 wiking	m.n.z release is really jsut about bugfixing
@sonney2k	my intention was to have only 2.0.X releases for bugfixes
 wiking	yep i get it
@sonney2k	yeah n++ for new features
 wiking	yes
@sonney2k	and m++ for major new features
 wiking	but now we have n++
 wiking	so afaik we should release 2.1
 wiking	instead of 2.0.1
@sonney2k	yeah but we intended to have a bugfix release back then
 wiking	or do both if it's easy to cherrypick bugfixes :P
@sonney2k	that is also why I wanted to have a shogun2_0 branch
 wiking	a tag would be enough
@sonney2k	wiking, not if you expect commits to the 2_0 branch
 wiking	you can essentially make your bugfixing branch from a tag
@sonney2k	you mean later?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	anytime
@sonney2k	yeah but why not have it immediately?
@sonney2k	this way anyone can push there already
 wiking	mmm well in sense of git's structure
 wiking	it doesn't really matter :P
@sonney2k	when we have small issues
 wiking	so yeah you can have both
@sonney2k	yeah - with git its cheap
 wiking	but i don't see neither now
@sonney2k	wiking, I told you... bug in make release script
 wiking	ok no worris
@sonney2k	I think it did the tagging locally but I forgot to push all tags
@sonney2k	and in the meantime killed the repo once
 wiking	can u find out which was the commit that you've checked out for making the tarballz?
@sonney2k	wiking, the git id is in every release
@sonney2k	lib/versionstring.h
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu
 wiking	ok
 wiking	then we can fix this easily soon
