 HeikoS1	thoralf: hey
 thoralf	Hey ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: thanks for sending all those fixes, I really like that. Just sending some comments to let you know I read this stuff :)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: do you want to discuss this subset stuff?
 HeikoS1	thoralf: oh and please add your name to the NEWs for the things you do
 thoralf	Yeah, I added a new comment on the issue.
 thoralf	(subset stack thing)
 thoralf	We can do it here, but I'm missing the markup. ;)
 HeikoS1	ok
 HeikoS1	lets do it on github then :)
 thoralf	I think my last one should make it clean (if it wasn't before)

 abinash_panda	thoralf: Hi
 thoralf	Hey Abinash
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Thanks for your guidance and suggestions, my PR finally got merged :)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Cool.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I heard you're interested in other projects as well?  Do you mind telling something about it?
 thoralf	No preasure, I'm just curious.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah, sure. I have applied for another project for implementation of inference algorithms.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: The library "pgmpy" is very new and does not have any implementation of inference algorithms, so I thought of contributing over there also.
 thoralf	I see.
 thoralf	Whats the project you applied for?  Which algorithms?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: My project was: "pgmpy: Implementing Algorithms". I was planning on implementing on Map inference algorithms like belief propagation and graph cut.
 thoralf	Sounds familiar. ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah, shogun was inspiration for my project :)
 thoralf	Oh, I read your mail.  So you already decided?
 thoralf	Cool, congrats.
 thoralf	Let's wait for the projects to be approved by google (deduplication still running till end of this week I think)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I am also eagerly waiting for it :)
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Update ;)
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Sun Jun 3 15:33:16 2012 -0700 added create_centering_matrix
 HeikoS1	thoralf:  update
 thoralf	HeikoS1: update :D
 thoralf	Cool.
 thoralf	I feel convergence.
 thoralf	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW1fXL3s7bk#t=84
* thoralf hums "Can you feel it..."
 HeikoS1	haha :)
 HeikoS1	just added another annoying commetn
 HeikoS1	thoralf: we are after the same thing
 HeikoS1	you want clean design, I want to keep clean API
 thoralf	Man!  set_burst_mode() is not a clean API! ;)
 thoralf	Okay.  One second.
 thoralf	Have to read. ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: problem is CFeatures::add_subset
 HeikoS1	what about a boolean flag, see update
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	Okay.  Not perfect, but better.
 thoralf	This way the caller may not forget unsetting the "burst mode"... still a flag, but, yeah.
 thoralf	add_subset(foo, true) <-- Burst
 thoralf	add_subset(foo) <-- Normal?
 thoralf	HeikoS1:
 HeikoS1	thoralf: yes
 HeikoS1	thoralf: require some changes, but at least no new methods everywhere
 HeikoS1	I mean otherwise we also blow up the CFeaures/CLabels/CCustomKernel interface
 HeikoS1	since the new method has to be mapped through
 thoralf	You still have to map this new parameter through, right?
 HeikoS1	thoralf: yes
 HeikoS1	thoralf: actually, we can have a method in the subsetstack
 thoralf	Hm.  Just curious, what about your burst parameter?
 HeikoS1	but a flag in CFeatures/CLabels
 HeikoS1	thats just one new method in subset_stack without any other changes
 thoralf	Didn't you need to pass the parameter as well?
 HeikoS1	feats.get_subset_stack().set_burst_mode(true)
 HeikoS1	call before and after, all other calls stay the same
 thoralf	Ah, hole-punching. ;)
 thoralf	I see.
 HeikoS1	its also safe to forget to unset this mode
 HeikoS1	because it will cause an error
 HeikoS1	so no wrong results or anything
 HeikoS1	(error when removing subsets)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: actually, I still like this more than chaning all the methods (even with default parameter)
 HeikoS1	but the flag solution is also kind of ok
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Well, we don't have to agree anyway.  If you like your approach more, go for it. ;)
 HeikoS1	I enjoy discussing it
 thoralf	I didn't expect this discussion to deflate so much.
 HeikoS1	want the best thing, what do you prefer?
 HeikoS1	me neither ;)
 thoralf	:D
 thoralf	want the best thing <-- What you mean?
 HeikoS1	thoralf: I dont want my solution, but the one that is the best one, thats why I want to get your input
 thoralf	I see.
 thoralf	The problem with this discussions usually is, every solutions has drawbacks (otherwise it would be easy to agree on one).
 thoralf	So you're usually trying to do a weighted sum of drawbacks and advantages... but with different weights. ;)
 HeikoS1	true, but what is your opinion
 HeikoS1	what to do
 HeikoS1	if I wasnt there what would you do?

 thoralf	You mean, which of the two remaining solutions?
-!- newlido [~quassel@41.218.181.20] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS1	thoralf: yes
 thoralf	Okay, I'll toss a coin: http://xkcd.com/221/
 thoralf	The one with the additional flag to add subset. :D
 HeikoS1	haha
 thoralf	Indeed, I'd try to fix the classes somehow... but as it seems this wouldn't work because one cannot both use cases with classes.
 thoralf	s/classes/subclasses/
 HeikoS1	no we actually need a hybrid mode here
 HeikoS1	a class that can do both
 HeikoS1	unfortunately
 HeikoS1	thoralf: I mean
 HeikoS1	thoralf: its really just the same
 HeikoS1	because the add_subset code has to distinguish a case
 HeikoS1	its just where the flag is coming from: member, or parameter of method
 HeikoS1	so I dont really see a difference
 HeikoS1	and then I dont see a reason to go for the one with lots of work
 HeikoS1	ah I am terrible ;)
 thoralf	You're trying the compromise of a compromise of a compromise?
 thoralf	You can try that. ;)
 HeikoS1	no, one option is my original suggestion :)
 thoralf	I know.

 thoralf	Doing compromised until you have what you want.
 thoralf	Girls do this usually, right? ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: thats unfair, we only converged because I did not understand you in the beginngin
 HeikoS1	thoralf: (but yes ;)
 thoralf	Haha.

 HeikoS1	thoralf: whats the compromise?
 HeikoS1	thoralf: that you made?
 HeikoS1	thoralf: staying up late? :D
 thoralf	You're mean!
 thoralf	Go punching holes in shogun. ;)
 HeikoS1	I just found this: http://shop.github.com/
 HeikoS1	I dont get what you mean. Pls suggest a better way :P
 HeikoS1	thoralf: I baked a bread today, its about to be finished
 HeikoS1	thoralf: smells super nice in here
 thoralf	Btw., I'm not commenting "the issue"[tm] any more unless something really new happens.
 thoralf	Just because everything has been said from my side.
 thoralf	Repeating myself doesn't help, because you seem to understand my idea and it won't change by hearing it again. ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: we can still add the new methods to CFeatures/CLabels
 thoralf	And: Received awesome 50 messages from github just because someone[tm] likes commenting on github as much as I do.
 HeikoS1	haha ;)
 HeikoS1	hopefully your google groups them for you
 thoralf	My google, wait.
 thoralf	Let me check.
 thoralf	Can't find it.
 HeikoS1	thoralf: I think we should go for the extra method
 HeikoS1	just checked what is needed, its not too much
 HeikoS1	no flag, no set_burst
 HeikoS1	just a new method
 HeikoS1	also avoids the if then else mess in add_subset
 thoralf	Cool.
