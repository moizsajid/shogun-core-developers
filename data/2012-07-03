@sonney2k	blackburn, now it is you *and* me
* sonney2k why me
 blackburn	sonney2k: give me that buildbot I beat him
 blackburn	it keeps hanging on libshogun example
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, kick, punch no more dancing!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@sonney2k	blackburn, no looks ok http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/36
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	now R
 blackburn	in modular it hanged on libshogun
@sonney2k	it just started building...
 blackburn	before
 blackburn	but nothing changed I expect it to happen again
@sonney2k	blackburn, uhh maybe that example is using randomly generated data
 blackburn	yes it uses random
@sonney2k	some non-positive kernel?
@sonney2k	then kaboom
@sonney2k	*very rareely*
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	if it will work now
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rdf76374 / (src/.r-install.sh src/Makefile.template src/configure): support R 2.10 and greater again - http://git.io/AOJGyg
@sonney2k	lets hope I got this #*$#$%(* script right
@sonney2k	.saveRDS my $#!!
* sonney2k finally ordered some UPS and a new power supply
@sonney2k	lets hope it survives the next thunderstorm now

 blackburn	sonney2k: why did you revert it?
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	because it doesn't compile
@sonney2k	not even libshogun
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	let me check
@sonney2k	and you left
 blackburn	yeah sorry left and continue :D
 blackburn	should be some unnecessary includes or so
 blackburn	orr
@sonney2k	blackburn, now buildbot is OK (well was ok before you reverted the revert) for libshogun / static interfaces
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	ok it seems I fixed that in second commit
 blackburn	should be ok now
 blackburn	shogun-buildbot:  stop build "deb3 - modular_interfaces" obsolete
 blackburn	no? :D
 blackburn	shogun-buildbot: we are not friends anymore
 blackburn	ok compiles here nicely

@sonney2k	blackburn, look at waterfall now - lots of sub-steps. compile time for libshogun is < 1minute, for each modular interface 3-4 minutes
@sonney2k	and that is with all optimizations on
@sonney2k	so not too bad

 heiko	puffin444 what is it?
 puffin444	I realized when I was adding derivatives for combined kernel that the current method does not support two children in a parameter tree that have a parameter with the same name.
 heiko	couldnt you include the type then?
 puffin444	For example, suppose I had a combinted kernel that had two gaussian kernels. There are two different parameters with the same name in the tree.
 puffin444	"width"
 heiko	mmmh
 heiko	or even the address?
 puffin444	I was thinking about sending the address
 puffin444	I just didn't know whether that would be a good coding idea or not.
 heiko	from where would you need that?
 puffin444	In the gradient model selection method when it takes the information from/to the model selection framework and sends it from/to NLOPT
 heiko	from the model selection framework, you get the parameter combination , right?
 puffin444	Yes.
 heiko	mmh, perhaps then its relly best to search for the m_param address

 heiko	I got a qeustion:
 heiko	if you get the parameter combination, why do you actually need to get something else?
 heiko	why do you search the tree, isnt everything you need in the parametercombination
 puffin444	The gradient function currently returns the name of the parameter and its derivative. Current I use this to match it up with the parameter combination.

@sonney2k	blackburn, I am running some 3.0.5 rc ...
 heiko	puffin444 what if you would return the TParameter itself there? Would that make things easier?
 puffin444	I could try a CMap<address, value> map, but I fear things may go awry if the model selection decides to use another object during the process.
 puffin444	Like a CMap<Tparameter, value>?
 heiko	yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: 3.2.0 here but you know I have ACPI troubles
 heiko	its a bit scary, but do you think it would work?
 puffin444	Address instead of copy I assume (<Tparameter*, value>
 heiko	if you get a derivative, then then next thing you do is to change this parameter you got the derivative for right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean 3.5.0-rcX
@sonney2k	t
 puffin444	Yes after its sent to NLOPT
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	argh

 blackburn	sonney2k: how do you configure it?
 blackburn	any tool?
 heiko	puffin444, oh and I see, you cast parameters to float64_t,
 puffin444	I think it might work.
 heiko	but not all parameters have this type, you should add a check that at least one gets an error message if the type is different
 heiko	otherwise there will be strange memory errors
 puffin444	Yes I better do that.
 heiko	(talking about select_model)
 heiko	puffin444, oh and if you do dynamic_casts on pointers and dont check the result you could also just do the c-style one :) just saw that somewhere
 puffin444	I should be checking the result all the time. Where do I fail to check the result?
@sonney2k	blackburn, make menuconfig is what I use and on updates make oldconfig
 heiko	ExactInferenceMethod line 97
 blackburn	sonney2k: thanks
 blackburn	a lot of options I have no clue about hehe
 heiko	year there should be an error message if not a gaussian likelihood is used
@sonney2k	blackburn, but you can use make gconfig to get some gnome UI :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: no I am not scared of ncurses
 puffin444	oh that's checked in check_members
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you ever try to tune it for performance? however I am sure you did
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it worth?
@sonney2k	heiko can you speed up the statistics_linear_time_mmd example (quadratic too)? it really takes a couple of seconds here..
 heiko	puffin444, then all fine :) but no need for a dynamic cast at all, c-style is fine, but thats just a minor minor thingi :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea
 heiko	sonney2k, I could do that
 puffin444	I wonder why I did that

 blackburn	it was working IIRC
@sonney2k	blackburn, HMM is actually forced to use just 1 thread IIRC
 blackburn	sonney2k: should be but it works with one thread
@sonney2k	the new test suite is not really activated so it must fail
@sonney2k	the old one is using old APIs and a lot of work to fix  and so must fail :/

 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not understand the error - is it some memory error on that machine?
@sonney2k	blackburn, valgrind ...
 blackburn	I mean with this example
@sonney2k	might be segfaulting...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I checked it so many times before already
 blackburn	will try now
 blackburn	all converters were memory and thread safe
 blackburn	whoops
@sonney2k	but why should it fail then?
 blackburn	interesting why it appeared now
@sonney2k	blackburn, maybe they were...
@sonney2k	before we started the mess(tm)
@sonney2k	blackburn, are you aware of a tool that can monitor maximum memory consumption of a process?
@sonney2k	would be a nice thing to add to the build output...
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	well ps can track it but maximum..
* sonney2k sets 10G as ccache limit
 blackburn	sonney2k: and are you aware of a tool that disables drivers of kernel you don't need to have?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?? they are not loaded if you compile as much as possible as module...
 blackburn	sonney2k: but they are being compiled
@sonney2k	blackburn, though I usually check which hardware I have and select only that and disable the rest
 blackburn	sonney2k: manually?
@sonney2k	blackburn, manually yes - but I heard there really is a tool that creates a config based on currently loaded stuff (in running kernel)
@sonney2k	but I only know of its existence...
 blackburn	sonney2k: there are some things here - I do not really understand whether I need them
@sonney2k	trial and error...
 blackburn	smells like gentoo way already
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	however I really would like to get lid close and AC adapter to work so should try latest
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would say hard disk / file system / some graphics output / network / keyboard input is what you should keep turned on :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: why do you use this latest kernel?

 blackburn	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	students in germany don't get anything..
 blackburn	sonney2k: I also have cool supervisor who accepted my rsr paper into some grant and I received some money too
 blackburn	looks like I am going to merge all SLEP solvers in one
@sonney2k	heiko, do you recall the discussion about some more user friendly way to specify model selection in python?
@sonney2k	heiko, if so do you recall the best syntax
 heiko	sonney2k, yes
 heiko	ehm
 heiko	I think we wanted to do it with nested lists
 heiko	but I am not completely sure
 blackburn	shogun_please_do_something_cool()
 heiko	["width", [1,2,3,4,5]]
@sonney2k	heiko, you mean sth like [ 'parametername', [1,2,3]] ?
@sonney2k	heh
 heiko	yes
 heiko	but the problem was the nesting
@sonney2k	actually [[ 'parametername1', [1,2,3]], ['parametername2', ['a','b','c']]
 heiko	yes, but if you want to have parameters of parameters
 heiko	one needs to specify cildren
 heiko	every node could look like
@sonney2k	heiko, do you have an example?
 heiko	[name, values, [optional: children]
 heiko	svm->GaussianKernel or Linear Kernel
@sonney2k	I don't get what parameters of parametes are
 blackburn	hah parameter hell
@sonney2k	ahh
 heiko	GaussianKernel has width
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	parameter panic
 heiko	of the new GP stuff
 heiko	multiple inference methods with multiple likelihood models with multiple kernels
 blackburn	heiko: you should really specify parameter panic option there then
 heiko	its catched when these trees are constructed :)
 heiko	only legal trees may be constructed otherwise exception
 heiko	took me half of last week fixing a case I forgot ..
 heiko	.but back to the recursion ...
 heiko	sonney2k, every parameter may have values and/or children
@sonney2k	heiko, well if we don't use nested lists but dictionaries it would work
 heiko	thats a good idea, had that also in mind
 heiko	but still
 heiko	how to specify
 heiko	oh wait
 heiko	we could oriente on the tree structure
 heiko	three types of nodes:
 heiko	empty(children only), value, sgobject
 heiko	but in C thats determined by the type
 heiko	["kernel", [GaussianKernel(), ["width", [2,3,4]]]]
 heiko	mmmh nah
 heiko	there I mean thats the crucial point
 heiko	perhaps gsomix has a idea?
 gsomix	heiko, no yet
 heiko	gsomix, sonney2k, have a look at the parameter_tree examples in libshogun
 heiko	there are many cases covered
 heiko	maybe if you see that you get an idea how to do it
@sonney2k	heiko, maybe we should support 2 kinds of syntax
@sonney2k	one simple one
@sonney2k	which would just be nested list
@sonney2k	I guess that is the most common case anyways
 heiko	mmh, we could do that
@sonney2k	easy to type but limited
 heiko	with the complicated one I had in mind that its optional
 heiko	so if you dont specify sub-parameters, its exactly the simple one
@sonney2k	and one more complex one
 heiko	so there is only one language, but both things may be expressed
@sonney2k	if it works out yes
 blackburn	I have to notice you are not talking about syntax right now
 blackburn	try to look at things like rcParams in matplotlib
 heiko	python has tuples
 puffin444	Hey, does anyone here know of a good way to debug type issues for the python_modular interface?
 heiko	maybe these can help
 blackburn	puffin444: type issues like?
@sonney2k	{ 'param' : [0,1,2] }
 blackburn	heiko: ms['C'] = blabla?
 heiko	("name", values, optional: children)
 blackburn	do not forget we can use [] here
 puffin444	I call the constructor of ExactInferenceMethod, and it gives me a NotImplementedError because somehow it thinks that the type of one of the arguments is wrong.
 puffin444	I can't tell which one it thinks is wrong, and I know all of the arguments should be of the correct type.
@sonney2k	heiko how about: { 'param' : { 'nested1': [0,1,2], 'nested2' : [4,5,6]} }
 blackburn	puffin444: oh hard case to debug
 heiko	sonney2k, problem is with the childs
 heiko	in your example, it has to be possible that the numbers have sub-parameters
 blackburn	puffin444: all I can suggest is to check types :)
 heiko	but these should be of the same form as the root
 blackburn	puffin444: however this can be a SWIG issue
 puffin444	Like type the names of the arguments? Those are correct.
 blackburn	puffin444: possible issues can be
 puffin444	When I type the names of the arguments the type return is correct
 blackburn	wrong order of includes
 blackburn	or missed forward declaration of class
 puffin444	blackburn, what order should the includes be in the .i files?
 puffin444	It all works in the libshogun examples
 blackburn	puffin444: first things first
 blackburn	puffin444: yeah swig is dangerous world
@sonney2k	heiko, if we add a 'values' to the dictionary?
@sonney2k	ahh no
* sonney2k mind explosion
 heiko	herrlich, these parameter trees are lovely to cause headaches :)
@sonney2k	puffin444, the order of includes matters in swig - so include the type first
 puffin444	So should I include superclasses before subclasses? And I should include classes that others depend on first?
 heiko	 * -root node: no name and no CSGObject, may have children
 puffin444	That sound quite evil that SWIG doesn't tell me these things at complie time
 heiko	 * -CSGObject node: has name and a CSGObject, may have children which are the
 heiko	 * parameters of the CSGObject. CSGObjects are SG_REF'ed/SG_UNREF'ed
 heiko	 * -value node: a node with a (parameter) name and an array of values for that
 heiko	 * parameter. These ranges may be set using build_values().
 heiko	 * This node is always a leaf.
 blackburn	puffin444: yeah it is
 blackburn	evil as is
 heiko	(from the ModelSelectionParameter.h)
 heiko	we need a grammar that can handle these three types
@sonney2k	puffin444, yes
 heiko	and the build-values has to be implicit without an extra call (need for reference)
 puffin444	When I edit the .i files do I have to do a make clean and build everything over?
 blackburn	puffin444: no I don't think so
 puffin444	yay! it works!
@sonney2k	puffin444, no make does it

 heiko	sonney2k, what if we parse input lists/tuples for these three types:
 heiko	P->[] is root node
 heiko	P->["name", SGObject like GaussianKernel, [optional: children, list of Ps]]
 heiko	P->["value_name", [values]]
@sonney2k	heiko, we need to craft examples for each of the types above

 blackburn	puffin444_: I love 'how the heck' thing

 heiko	[["kernel", GaussianKernel(), [["width", [2,3,4]], ["kernel", LinearKernel(),[]]
 heiko	["svm", LibSVM, [["kernel", GaussianKernel(), [["width", [2,3,4]], ["kernel", LinearKernel(),[]]]
 blackburn	puffin444_: may be we have some warnings turned off - I don't really know
 puffin444_	I dont know. It's a nicer thing to say compared to some other choices.
 puffin444_	There is also doggone it and dadgumit
 puffin444_	Those are sort of Southern US phrases
 heiko	sonney2k, what do you think of this?
 blackburn	puffin444_: friend of mine studied in wisconsin-maddyson has told me before that all the obscene words are replaced in that 'madtown' with something like that
 blackburn	that's funny
 puffin444_	lol
 blackburn	I can't remember any though
 blackburn	ehm I think I made two mistakes in the university name

@sonney2k	heiko, I would wish we can use dictionaries to make it easier to read

 heiko	sonney2k, perhaps you are right, one easy one where you can directly add values to names
 heiko	and one complicated one (current one may be used for now)
 blackburn	heiko: sonney2k: I would suggest again (you ignored first time) :D
 blackburn	ms['C'].values = (1,2,5)
 heiko	blackburn, sorry :)
@sonney2k	{"svm" : [ LibSVM : {"kernel" : { GaussianKernel() : {"width" : [2,3,4]}, LinearKernel()}}
 blackburn	ms['C'].add_child('width')
 blackburn	why not this way?
 heiko	how to add values for the width child?
@sonney2k	heiko, ^ how about that?
 blackburn	my example is pretty crappy but still
 blackburn	each time you do ms['parameter name'] = values
 blackburn	or values, childs
 heiko	sonney2k, thats what I wrote above
 blackburn	it is created
 heiko	ah no
 heiko	almost
 heiko	you have a list
 heiko	blackburn think of sub-sub-parameters
 blackburn	heiko: what is the problem
 heiko	how would you do svm with two kernels where each one got a different parameter?
 blackburn	my suggested approach is the same as yours but syntax
 blackburn	it is really inconvenient to write such {{}{{}{}{}
@sonney2k	{"svm" : { LibSVM() :
@sonney2k	                {"kernel" : { GaussianKernel() : {"width" : [2,3,4]},
@sonney2k	                                LinearKernel() : []}
@sonney2k	                }
@sonney2k	         }
@sonney2k	}
 blackburn	haha you are bad lisp programmer
 blackburn	:D
 gsomix	pretty print from lisp
 heiko	sonn2y, that might work
 heiko	we should check all cases first though
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think this is *much* more readble
@sonney2k	blackburn, look at heikos examples
 blackburn	sonney2k: not in this format but generally yes
@sonney2k	all this add child whatever
@sonney2k	it is very hard to digest
 blackburn	I actually would need the same thing for mt
@sonney2k	and in normal setting one only uses
@sonney2k	{"width" : [2,3,4]}
 heiko	yeah add child sucks, and especially calling methods on children - that makes it really hard to read
 heiko	since you need to store references for all children
@sonney2k	heiko, haha  { GaussianKernel() : 17 }
@sonney2k	Traceback (most recent call last):
@sonney2k	  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

@sonney2k	I think we can use the pointer as hash key though

@sonney2k	blackburn, not happy with the ptr?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it is a common way (java way)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	each object should have clone and hash

@sonney2k	heiko, I think it is parseable
@sonney2k	{
@sonney2k	 
@sonney2k	 'C' : [2,4],
@sonney2k	 'kernel' : {
@sonney2k	               PowerKernel() : {
 heiko	puffin444, I saw it, nice :)
@sonney2k	                                  'degree' : [2,4],
@sonney2k	                                  'distance' : { MinkowskiMetric() : { 'k' : [1,2] } }
@sonney2k	                                },
@sonney2k	               GaussianKernel() : { 'width' : [2,4] },
@sonney2k	               DistantSegmentsKernel() : {
@sonney2k	                                            'delta' : [2,4],
@sonney2k	                                            'theta' : [2,4]
@sonney2k	                                         }
 heiko	I will have a look tomorrow, ok? quite tired now
@sonney2k	            }
@sonney2k	}
@sonney2k	gsomix, nite - thanks for listening :)
@sonney2k	heiko, 5 mins for the first example
@sonney2k	pleeeeeaaase
 blackburn	lol
 heiko	one thing: could you write tests for all of the cases you are hashing? :)
@sonney2k	there might be no tomorrow :D
 heiko	sonney2k, alright :)
 gsomix	lol [2]
 heiko	lol :D
 heiko	I hope there is
 heiko	puffin444, all of the code should be covered at least once in some test. This is the memory-bug land, and its always good to check early :)
 blackburn	tomorrow is already here so you will have it too
@sonney2k	I think we have a nice syntax now
 heiko	but perhaps a bit later
 heiko	sonney2k, ok
 heiko	sonney2k, looks fine
 heiko	did you do that by hand? :)
@sonney2k	heiko, haha
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	hmm I want to add lisp support
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, lush you mean
 blackburn	no CL
 heiko	sonney2k, thats pretty readably
 blackburn	swig supports only allegro and CL
 heiko	looks almost like the example output on pastebin
 blackburn	hmm ony allegro even
@sonney2k	heiko, so as values one can have None, scalars, vectors, matrices or whatever
@sonney2k	or just lists?
@sonney2k	that is the only thing not so clear to me currently
 blackburn	hahah swig accepted some russian or ukrainian guy for documentation
 puffin444_	heiko, will do.
 blackburn	lol
 heiko	sonney2k, void* m_values;
@sonney2k	heiko, gsomix will work on implementing this stuff at some point
 heiko	 :)
@sonney2k	so you (heiko) and puffin444_ are the modsel param experts now
 blackburn	do you understand we will not be able to parse swig doc?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	help him whenever possible
 heiko	yeah its coming along pretty well, the framework improvements are great :)
@sonney2k	heiko, he can easily do the swig typemaps on his own but not the conversion
 heiko	conversion?
@sonney2k	to shogun's modsel params
@sonney2k	the tree
 blackburn	Ocaml, Go or CLisp?
@sonney2k	(tm)
 heiko	ah alright
 heiko	I can help there
 heiko	Actually, so far, there is no example of registering a non-scalar numerical parameter
@sonney2k	o~~~only~~~you~~~~ooo~~~oooonly~~~you
 heiko	so I dont know how that would work
 heiko	lol :)
@sonney2k	well simple things first
 blackburn	sonney2k: heiko: do we want to become first ocaml ML library?
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@109.169.149.14] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean w/o examples and documentation?
 blackburn	sure
 heiko	blackburn, I dont even know that :D
 blackburn	it is not fun to write examples and doc
 heiko	who will translate all the examples :) we need slaves
@sonney2k	blackburn, why that?
 blackburn	for me it is not
@sonney2k	you always pretended it its
@sonney2k	is
 blackburn	no I don't like it
@sonney2k	you even wanted a doc sprint
@sonney2k	hah
 blackburn	hah yes I wanted it
 blackburn	but
 blackburn	it is not fun at all
@sonney2k	must have been your not so evil twin who suggested that
 heiko	blackburn has exponentially many evil twins :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: schizophrenia as it is :D
 blackburn	ich bin ich!
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you have lots of friends and enemies
@sonney2k	never alone - very good
 blackburn	sonney2k: ich habe many friends, ja
 blackburn	habst du?
 blackburn	ok my german is over
 heiko	hehe :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, but seriously - once things stabalize again we need to get down to 0 warnings and you should really start the doc
@sonney2k	probably fun!
@sonney2k	you can push everyone to do it
 blackburn	sonney2k: how so?
 heiko	guys, I gotta go, I agree with the docs btw, great thing to have and also not too boring to write
@sonney2k	(even me - your personal stalin :D
 blackburn	I have no ak-47
 heiko	good night!
 blackburn	it is not true all russians have ak-47
@sonney2k	heiko, thanks for your thoughts
@sonney2k	and n8
 blackburn	heiko: goog nidht
 heiko	nacht :)
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-182-167-85.range86-182.btcentralplus.com] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	heikos connection was remarkably stable...
 blackburn	I guess they use pigeon tcp/ip now
@sonney2k	seems to be sufficient for IRC
@sonney2k	blackburn, so where are we with our buildbot pleasureness?

@sonney2k	hey hey
* sonney2k checks the waterfall
@sonney2k	(the only page google chrom can still display)
 blackburn	sonney2k: disable gpu acceleration or so
@sonney2k	blackburn, I did
@sonney2k	didn't help
@sonney2k	I disabled all extensions, plugins
@sonney2k	even created a new account
@sonney2k	so with empty settings, no extensions, plugins and all gpu stuff disabled in about:flags
@sonney2k	it hangs on github.com
@sonney2k	since version 20
@sonney2k	and the dev one (21.x) too :/
 blackburn	did you report?
-!- cwidmer [8ca3fe9d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.140.163.254.157] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	sonney2k, time to celebrate http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	we passed the python flag
@sonney2k	cwidmer, just got up?
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you talking to yourself?
@sonney2k	sonney2k, yes
@sonney2k	:P
 cwidmer	sonney2k, heh, it's 17:30 in NY, so nope

@sonney2k	cwidmer, so you always wait until no one is in this channel before joining?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, planning the attack to mars?
 cwidmer	blackburn is there
 cwidmer	i think he lives in ny time zone
@sonney2k	with bb yes
 cwidmer	irrespective or location
@sonney2k	cwidmer, in the morning he is kind of some Ueberzombie
@sonney2k	but at night some beauty queen
 cwidmer	heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuc_zrg79IE&feature=player_detailpage
@sonney2k	blackburn, *I CANNOT*
 blackburn	hahah
 cwidmer	blackburn, is sonney2k drunk? ;)
@sonney2k	google chrome hangs
 blackburn	cwidmer: probably - he already has been singing
 cwidmer	hahaha
@sonney2k	*ON EVERY PAGE EXCEPT THE BUILDBOT*
@sonney2k	so I am working on the buildbot
 blackburn	ahhh
 blackburn	thats why
 cwidmer	hehe
 blackburn	google chrome builbot edition
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you understand why we made it
 cwidmer	chrome has a task manager
@sonney2k	all green now!
 blackburn	sonney2k: gdb google-chrome
@sonney2k	well if we ignore the organe
 blackburn	start
 blackburn	c
 blackburn	c
 blackburn	c
@sonney2k	blackburn, ???
@sonney2k	only the tab hangs
 blackburn	sonney2k: debug it step by step
@sonney2k	and then it complains about being unresponsive
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: should be easy
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I planned to find the error that makes my AC undetectable

 blackburn	2M of source files in kernels should be easy to debug
 blackburn	so it is just piece of cake to debug chrome then

@sonney2k	blackburn, well you should ask on lkml
@sonney2k	though it didn't sound like a kernel bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: but bug of what then?
 blackburn	hmm ac_adapter state updates perfectly
 blackburn	in <1s
 blackburn	sonney2k: however lid close doesn't work
 blackburn	and suspend does not work too
@sonney2k	uhh
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not really understand yet what makes all system think ac is disconnected - but this event is not being propagated
@sonney2k	that can take time to fix...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't really care but it would be better
 blackburn	to have functionality one must to have
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think it is 5 line fix
 blackburn	suspend does everything but not power-off
 blackburn	it seems for me that it simply can't send this acpi event too
 blackburn	actually samsung guys participate in development
 blackburn	so I expect it will be fixed at some point even w/o me
 cwidmer	haha, enjoying your new hardware?
@sonney2k	retina displays alll over :D
 blackburn	cwidmer: yeahh
 blackburn	well I really enjoy but linux way
 blackburn	with some pain
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	it is the biggest adventure
@sonney2k	even beats shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is?
 blackburn	sonney2k: however it took 4 years to make backlight work :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you fixed your converters within days ... so shogun is really beginner level
 blackburn	no it is numeric stuff
 blackburn	totally different thing
