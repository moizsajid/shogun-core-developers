 besser82	sonne|work:  hey!
 besser82	sonne|work:  you still need that rpm-stuff???
 sonne|work	besser82: yes please
 besser82	sonne|work:  to which mail-addy?
 sonne|work	besser82: Soeren.Sonnenburg@tomtom.com
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@24-134-74-216-dynip.superkabel.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 sonne|work	besser82: btw have you seen the buildbot did build and run most of the osx tests
 sonne|work	just 40 of 900 or so failed
 besser82	sonne|work:  not yet; currently triaging all new info, which came in since yesterday  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: configuration was pretty difficult due to the mac having /usr/bin/python and /usr/local/bin/python (both the same 2.7.5 version...)
 besser82	sonne|work:  lemme guess, one is sys other is mac-ports, rye?
 sonne|work	besser82: no brew !
 sonne|work	besser82: did you sent the .spec ?
 besser82	sonne|work:  spec && example tarball just out
 besser82	sonne|work:  so why there is two python interp on OSX???
 sonne|work	besser82: well I don't use mac ports but brew!
 besser82	sonne|work:  so one is sys other brew?
 sonne|work	yes
 besser82	sonne|work:  I see...
 sonne|work	and the cmake python detection is just broken
 besser82	sonne|work:  is it?
 sonne|work	yes because when I give it the python in /usr/local/bin
 sonne|work	it will choose the libs in /usr/lib/
 sonne|work	-> kaboom
 sonne|work	that is why wiking and others saw the crashes
 besser82	sonne|work:  Then you'll need to pass the correct python-libs, too
 sonne|work	so I needed to manually specify libs and includes and all good
 sonne|work	yup
 sonne|work	anyway we are in good shape to get stuff going now
 besser82	sonne|work:  which is on all OS the same if ${ver_string} of interp and foreign libs match  :-P
 sonne|work	well no
 sonne|work	it should take the one from /usr/local first
 besser82	sonne|work:  well cmake is supposed not to expect same versions from different builds on the same sys  ;)
 sonne|work	alright .spec time
* sonne|work off
 besser82	sonne|work:  If it would prefer /usr/local and you use system's ver then the same will happen but different  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: indeed
 besser82	sonne|work:  can you archieve what you intend with that spec-templ?
 besser82	wiking:  mrunge says the problem is related to iscsi indeed
 besser82	wiking:  you should possibly check the config of "Cinder"
 besser82	wiking:  more he couldn't says to that actually, because someone setup thatopenStack with "devstack"  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  which by far isn't the recommended way for production-systems  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  https://www.berrange.com/posts/2012/11/20/what-devstack-does-to-your-host-when-setting-up-openstack-on-fedora-17/
 besser82	wiking:  you possibly want to show the sys-admin this:  http://openstack.redhat.com/Main_Page
 besser82	wiking:  that is a how-to-install openstack on CentOS / SL / Fedora  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  for using that in production
 besser82	sonne|work:  spec is sufficient?  Or need some help?
 sonne|work	besser82: still messing with it - I guess it will do
 besser82	sonne|work:  if you need some advise or sth; just ask
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah one thing - what if the version number is not just 1.0.0 but I would want to attach some e.g. git hash or so?
 besser82	sonne|work:  you should do that in Release:
 besser82	sonne|work:  like Release: 1.${?githash}%{?dist}
 besser82	sonne|work:  and set %global githash $sha in the uppeline of that spec
 sonne|work	so I can add arbitrarily many dots at the back
 sonne|work	at the end
 besser82	sonney2k:  yes
 besser82	sonney2k:  but the recommended way would be using that in Release
 besser82	sonney2k:  since in Version: that might be a problem when comparing different version
 besser82	sonney2k:  if you want, you can give me some toy-tarball and I can give you a working spec within few minutes
 besser82	sonne|work:  ^^^
 besser82	sonne|work:  since writing some spec for is like putting some butter on a slice of bread  :D
 sonne|work	besser82: no no I want to do this myself - but thanks I will ask you
 sonne|work	when I am stuck
 besser82	sonne|work:  kk, as you wish  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: regarding version - in debian we do that by prepending the date
 sonne|work	and then addign the git hash
 besser82	sonne|work:  i know, but version comparison in rpm works a bit different
 besser82	sonne|work:  if you need to write spec more frequently in future this might come in handy: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package
 sonne|work	besser82: thx
 besser82	sonne|work:  inp  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  np  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: any idea how to force rpm creation to use legacy .gz and md5sum?
 besser82	sonne|work:  rpmbuild-md5
 sonne|work	besser82: the machine running things on is running *verystable*
 besser82	sonne|work:  that is the legacy-rpm (rpm <= 4.0.0) generator
 besser82	sonne|work:  NO whitespace before hiphen  ;)
 sonne|work	well well
 sonne|work	won't rpmbuild --define "_source_filedigest_algorithm md5"  \
 sonne|work	   --define "_binary_filedigest_algorithm md5"
 sonne|work	work too
 sonne|work	besser82: ^^^ ?
 besser82	sonne|work: should do the trick, too  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: but rpmbuild-md5 is guranteed to be avail in every RH-based dist until el5 will go EOL  ;)
 sonne|work	yeah but I am not on a RH based distro atm :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  so you are using rpmbuild on debian, rye?
 sonne|work	heh
 sonne|work	yes
 besser82	sonne|work:  for such cases I can supply you tarball with basic chroot of el6 or Fedora  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: :P
 sonne|work	besser82: is it possible to not strip the executables?
 besser82	sonne|work:  yes, just moment...
 besser82	sonne|work:  add "%global __os_install_post %{nil}" on top of spec  ;)

@iglesiasg	hello hello
-!- pickle27 [d8bfe7da@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.191.231.218] has joined #shogun
 pickle27	meeting?
@iglesiasg	pickle27, we can start it
@iglesiasg	:D
 pickle27	I still worry I somehow messed up UTC
@iglesiasg	I don't think so, the time is right
@iglesiasg	otherwise, we are both wrong hehe
@iglesiasg	pickle27, so we will become mentors this year!
 pickle27	yeah! Im excited!
 pickle27	you're going to mentor to? won't you still be eligible?
@iglesiasg	yes, I think I will be
@iglesiasg	but I am not sure I can handle full time job + gsoc hehe
 lisitsyn	hey there
@iglesiasg	and I just started here in Netherlands so I guess it would not be a good idea
@iglesiasg	pickle27, still, I will be eligible a couple of years more as PhD, so maybe I come back to apply...
 pickle27	yeah especially if you can basically work on your phd as gsoc
@iglesiasg	yep
 lisitsyn	hmm what can I mentor :D
@iglesiasg	world domination!
@iglesiasg	:D
 lisitsyn	okay probably plugin framework
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@185.6.237.120] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	hey, happy hacking time
@iglesiasg	wow!
@iglesiasg	buildbot is badly broken! http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/waterfall
@iglesiasg	integration tests failing hm
 pickle27	anyways I added a project on OpenCV integration and examples to the idea list which I'd be happy to mentor
 pickle27	I'd also be happy to help on any other projects or just be an extra shogun contact on a project
 lisitsyn	okay guys I added two projects I would like to mentor
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	pickle27: hey... mentoring this year :D
 lisitsyn	one pure C++ hardcore and one medium stuff
 lambday	lisitsyn: which ones?
 lisitsyn	lambday: Implement a framework for plugin-based architecture
 lisitsyn	Implement an easy to use modelselection API
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053041054.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	plugin stuff is likely to be quite tough
 lisitsyn	we need a rockstar here D:
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, mentor yourself :P
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053041054.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Client Quit]
 lisitsyn	yeah and then write letters my lazy student is full of bullshit
 lisitsyn	:D
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053041054.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
 lambday	lisitsyn: among 60+ applicants, we're surely find one like david gilmour :D
 lambday	heiko didn't join the meeting :(
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, plugin framework sounds like mission impossible for gsoc
@sonney2k	too complex
@sonney2k	if we don't have the very exact idea how it should work
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah lets keep it but only if we find a rockstar
@sonney2k	good evening gents
@sonney2k	:)
 lisitsyn	and if I have any kind of prototype
 lisitsyn	that's true
 lambday	good evening sonney2k
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well no we just need a very exact idea / protype then it is totally OK for gsoc even
@sonney2k	but I don't see that to happen in the next few weeks
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, actually buildbot is in the shape - besser82 did fix our test checks and now tests that fail really do fail ...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: why has it to happen next weeks ;)
 lisitsyn	we can keep any idea up to the decision date, ain't it that?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, 3 weeks until gsoc app deadline :P
 lisitsyn	but that's only orgs deadline
 lisitsyn	we are not going to settle ideas
 lisitsyn	can change them
@sonney2k	well we did last years...
@sonney2k	but sure you can add more
@iglesiasg	I can take care of putting the ideas on the website once the time comes btw
@iglesiasg	IIRC I did last year so I guess it is the best option
@sonney2k	dammed brew is in bad shape here
@sonney2k	maybe I need to reinstall
@iglesiasg	for the gsoc application, I guess it is completely fine to recycle last years' stuff?
@iglesiasg	there was another google doc with it I believe
 pickle27	i thought our gsoc site was deffs one of the better ones last yer
@iglesiasg	great! :)
@sonney2k	btw vojtech wants to mentor too this time libqp for real
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I think the OpenCV can be a very good idea btw
@iglesiasg	pickle27, even when simple stuff, it should be possible to get some eye-candy
@iglesiasg	:%s/when/with
 pickle27	yeah totally, plus we can kind of piggy back off of their popularity
@iglesiasg	true
@iglesiasg	about the libqp project
@iglesiasg	maybe we could aim at getting something easier to maintain that the libbmrm?
@sonney2k	so we can recycle a long standing gsoc entry :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah maybe we try to really separate things out
@iglesiasg	yep, that would be great
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, pickle27 - btw it would be cool if you both could be our publicity team
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, pickle27 we really need tweets / blog stuff and support the poor people trying shogun ;)
@iglesiasg	I am really careless with twitter... always forget to send updates if I am not reminded
@sonney2k	pickle27, are you more active?
 pickle27	not overly but I can try to be
@iglesiasg	helping people at IRC and mailing list is cool for me
 pickle27	Im getting more into twitter these days
@sonney2k	pickle27, well every now and then - currently we twitter every 3 months 5 items or so
@iglesiasg	I should be able to idle at IRC from the job soon
@sonney2k	would be better to have 1 item every week or so
 pickle27	best way to get publicity is to answer on stackoverflow
 pickle27	at least thats what I've seen
@sonney2k	who wants to do that?
 pickle27	scitkit has their twitter hooked into github
 pickle27	but its super annoying
@sonney2k	yeah no
@iglesiasg	not cool not cool
@sonney2k	no automated crap
@iglesiasg	we would get a peak of followers followed by a peak of unfollowers after max two days
@iglesiasg	pickle27, answering any sort of questions in stack overflow ?
 pickle27	no like machine learning ones and reference how to do it in shogun
@iglesiasg	I see
 pickle27	I think a good idea would be to tweet for each new notebook
@sonney2k	pickle27, yeah agreed - we had like 5 more or so since 3.0.0
 pickle27	anyways I'll make a concerted effort to talk, tweet and share shogun stuff!
@sonney2k	pickle27, also about our debian etc packages
@sonney2k	and even minor releases
@sonney2k	pickle27, btw any progress with the website?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, pickle27 it is good that we have this kind of publicity split - I am busy enough doing mloss.org updates and freshmeat and g+
 pickle27	sure! - I should use our official twitter account then - is there a way to give me access easily
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, often does news on the mailinglist
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I will send you the data right away
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, thanks :)
 pickle27	sonney2k: I got it running locally and then haven't worked on it yet, but I will!
@sonney2k	pickle27, cool
@iglesiasg	pickle27, done!
@sonney2k	I am currently completely reinstalling the osx buildbot (brew was broken...)
 pickle27	iglesiasg: got it!
@sonney2k	would anyone in the meantime help to get the few failing tests in python modular fixed?
@iglesiasg	perfect
@sonney2k	 97 - integration-python_modular-tester-statistics_kmm (Failed)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, the integration ones?
@sonney2k	219 - integration-python_modular-tester-kernel_histogram_word_string_modular (Failed)

@sonney2k	287 - integration-python_modular-tester-statistics_quadratic_time_mmd (Failed)
@sonney2k	299 - integration-python_modular-tester-statistics_mmd_kernel_selection_combined (Failed)
@sonney2k	yeah
@iglesiasg	I can have a look starting in a couple of minutes
@iglesiasg	hopefully it is just about generating the data for the tests again?

 pickle27	hey guys random question, whats the process for submitting a PR to shogun again, you submit it and then someone with push rights reviews and merges right
 pickle27	do the people with push rights merge their own PRs or do they wait for someone else to review and merge it for them
 pickle27	I don't have push so it doesn't affect me, Im just curious

@iglesiasg	pickle27, it depends
@iglesiasg	no real rules have been spoken for this
@iglesiasg	some people commit and push directly to upstream
 pickle27	okay cool!
@iglesiasg	IMHO making PR and waiting for some other to merge it is a safer approach
 pickle27	yeah I agree
 pickle27	at work we merge our own but you ask 2 other devs for a code review and after they give it the okay you merge your own
 pickle27	btw sonney2k can I get added to the shogun org on github? I don't need push rights but I'd like to be in the org, there is teams for controlling access etc
@sonney2k	pickle27, sure
@iglesiasg	but anyway, providing that we are very few devs here, it is true that waiting for some other to check your stuff and merge is not usually practical
@sonney2k	pickle27, you are in :)
 pickle27	wooooo!
@iglesiasg	the team is getting larger and larger :)
* sonney2k wonders what the buildbot is doing
@sonney2k	takes ages...
