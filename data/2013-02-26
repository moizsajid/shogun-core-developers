 blackburn	sonney2k: oh that's a great effort
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope we will get a chance to release this weekend
@sonney2k	blackburn, my internet connection sucks here so I cannot help
 blackburn	sonney2k: we will have a hackathon to finish my paper
@sonney2k	I have 30 secs ping's!
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's bad.. may be we'll wait for you then
 blackburn	sonney2k: where are you?
@sonney2k	blackburn, there are still > 60 warnings and some error to fix right?

 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah that's why I'd like to wait

@sonney2k	n4nd0, hey there!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, any time yet for getting the menu to work?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi! no, not yet, sorry
 n4nd0	maybe I can start checking it by the weekend
 n4nd0	I have been working on a simple dim. reduction algo these last days
@sonney2k	n4nd0, np - would just be cool to have it before we sent out announcements like workshop / gsoc / new release
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I thought the previous update was enough before the announcement :D
 n4nd0	anyway, give me time during the weekend and I will do my best to get it to work
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw, regarding an hyphothetical project on structured learning for gsoc, do you think we can get an expert in the field to mentor or co-mentor it?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, if someone tries why not? I haven't so far though...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am very interested in a project like that so do you think it is OK to send some e-mails around?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, sure go ahead
@sonney2k	n4nd0, would make sense to ask gunnar/chris
 n4nd0	n4nd0: if they could mentor?
 n4nd0	I really like the work of Sebastian Nowozin, Christoph Lampert, Thorsten Joachims and Thomas Finley on structured prediction
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you happen to know Sebastian? I see he was in TU
