 alamages	i am using shogun c++ interface without any problems. i decided to also test the python interface. I compiled the code with -DPythonModular=ON and everything seems ok after the installation. I have included to the PYTHONPATH the directory of shogun python site-packages. Although I can import shogun in python whenever I call any function of shogun I get a segfault
 alamages	I checked with gdb and is always the same error (no matter the function of shogun I call) its:
 alamages	Python/getargs.c: No such file or directory.

 alamages	any ideas what am I doing wrong here?
 alamages	I use python3 btw
 alamages	and shogun 3.2.0

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
@HeikoS	alamages: hi
 alamages	hi :)
@lisitsyn	I guess new swig :)
@HeikoS	segfaults when importing shogun mostly come from compiling shogun with a different python version than the one its used in, so make sure you dont have any virtualenv ambiguities going on
@HeikoS	or it might be new swig
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw we should try to put a version check
@lisitsyn	should be possible
 alamages	I am not using any virtualenv
 alamages	SWIG Version 3.0.5
@lisitsyn	yeah that's swig
@lisitsyn	we didn't yet resolve issues with new swig
 alamages	which swig should I have so I can make it work
 alamages	which swig version*
@HeikoS	alamages: swig2 is more stable
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: definitely
 alamages	ok so I will install swig2 and try to use that

 alamages	truly it was swig after all
 alamages	I used swig to generate the python interface and know the examples work fine
 alamages	no segfault and stuff, thanks again (you saved me tones of time)
 alamages	swig2*
