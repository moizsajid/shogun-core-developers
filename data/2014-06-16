@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@HeikoS	will check soon
@wiking	kk
@HeikoS	now meeting a ML meetup person who wants to do a shogun hands on workshop here soon
@wiking	btw we need to do something about our preprocessors

@wiking	HeikoS: almost all our preprocessors are dense feature preprocessors
@wiking	like PNorm
@wiking	that should be available for sparse case as well :S

@HeikoS	wiking: yep! also feature selection as lambday currently builds
 lambday	HeikoS: hey!
@wiking	mmm feature selection
@wiking	how where?
 lambday	what did I miss ... checking log
@wiking	since now we have random forest and that could be part of feature selection as well
@wiking	jesus i'm going to benchmark this fucking scikit-learn as it's amazing how long it does take to train a liblinear...
 lambday	wiking: what's your idea about preprocessor?
@HeikoS	lambday: hey! I currently am waiting for a call, but will be there afterwards.-
 lambday	wiking: I'm planning to add some feature selection algorithms under CDimensionReductionPreprocessor
 lambday	HeikoS: alright :)
@wiking	mmm shit
@wiking	CDimensionReductionPreprocessor is based on CDensePreprocessor
@wiking	:(
@wiking	so actually we cannot do either pca nor kpca on sparse matrix
 lambday	wiking: oh... well it doesn't necessarily be under dense per se...
 lambday	I mean what I was planning...
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.222.13.170] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@wiking	lambday: yeah no i mean it's not your fault
@wiking	i mean that we should refactor
@wiking	a bit the preprocessing
@wiking	as it's quite bad that we cannot do atm pca on sparse matrix
@wiking	lambday: i'll need another month and i'll be back in shogun full time :P
 lambday	wiking: hehe yeah.. :)
 lambday	wiking: I was also thinking to work on the plugins project with lisitsyn and make it ready before next year gsoc
@wiking	lambday: i'm up for it
@wiking	after mid july
 lambday	wiking: yeah I am hopefully will be a bit free after this gsoc...
 lambday	currently juggling many balls at once :/
@wiking	oh woah

 lambday	wtf
 lambday	no unit-tests?
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	do we support scipy.sparse -> shogun sparse?
 lambday	wiking: I just checked... works fine here :/
 lambday	wiking: yep
 lambday	>>> from modshogun import SparseRealFeatures >>> f=SparseRealFeatures() >>> f SparseFeatures >>>
@wiking	lambday: how do i create SparseRealFeatures from <60000x80371 sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.float64'>' with 426868 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
@wiking	?
 lambday	wiking: wait checking
 lambday	wiking: check this examples/undocumented/python_modular/mathematics_logdet.py
@wiking	mmm python is constantly crashing on osx :(
@wiking	with shogun
 lambday	that sucks!...
 lambday	it works on linux.. just tested
@wiking	X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(feats_norm, labels, test_size=0.4, random_state=0)
@wiking	b_train = BinaryLabels(y_train)
@wiking	this should work afaik
@wiking	as y_train is a simple np array
@wiking	i.e. SGVector
@wiking	but it segfaults
@wiking	fuck no more gdb on osx
@wiking	let's see what lldb can do

@HeikoS	lambday:  hey
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things?
 lambday	HeikoS: ran into a problem while fixing streaming mmd cov bug... - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2309
@wiking	HeikoS: we need a sponsor that gives us an osx buildbot
 lambday	HeikoS: but I think its minor issue and I spent too much time on figuring out what's wrong :(
@HeikoS	wiking: what exactly does that mean? a physical machine? or some money to pay for a cloud VM?
@HeikoS	lambday: checking the PR
 lambday	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	lambday: so its about the burst mode?
@HeikoS	lambday: since now there is lots of overhead?
@wiking	HeikoS: it's either $$ or just to run a buildslave on an osx machine that is online 24/7
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, the latter seems more tricky actually
@HeikoS	wiking: how much is that?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - so instead of streaming one block at a time, I changed it to stream many such blocks... but computation works blockwise
@HeikoS	lambday: ok yes, thats what I did before, right?
 lambday	HeikoS: this way it speeded up like before
@HeikoS	lambday: and the problem now are integration tests?
 lambday	HeikoS: exactly
 lambday	HeikoS: so I think it won't be hard to accomodate earlier implementation within this for testing purpose
@wiking	HeikoS: a lot ~80 usd/month
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah but I tried with more samples/changing the seed and it seems to work just fine
 lambday	as in, gives reasonable values
@HeikoS	lambday: so precomputing the fill kernel doesnt make sense you are right, but rather do it block wise
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that sounded reasonable to me so did it this way
@HeikoS	lambday: well then its fine, currently reading but your summary sounds totally reasonable
@HeikoS	wiking: thats too much for us to pay
@HeikoS	wiking: why is it so expensive?
@wiking	HeikoS: i know that's why i said that we need a sponsor
@wiking	HeikoS: dunno.. i couldn't find cheaper
@HeikoS	wiking: why can't we put OSx on fatbot?
 lambday	HeikoS: I am sending data PR then...
@HeikoS	wiking: okok, I will ask for that next time I meet people.
@HeikoS	wiking: and about 24/7 macos
@HeikoS	how reliable must tha tbe?
@wiking	HeikoS: because a) fatbot is already full with other tasks b) running osx in a VM is pretty fucking hard...
@HeikoS	can I put one here? like an old laptop or so?
@wiking	yeah anything is ok
@wiking	just to have it online 24/7
@HeikoS	wiking: how reliable?
@HeikoS	wiking: sometimes internet fails here etc
@HeikoS	cleaner might unplug
@HeikoS	wiking: not for long, but might happen once in a while
@HeikoS	wiking: and how old can the laptop be maximum?
@HeikoS	lambday: patch seems fine though I might be missing details
@HeikoS	lambday: so what about the integration problems?
@HeikoS	lambday: before you send the PR
@HeikoS	lambday: what exactly fails?
@wiking	HeikoS: well at least it should be intel
@wiking	:P i.e. not powerpc
@wiking	and that it should have at least 5G free mem
@wiking	because of the modular interface
@HeikoS	lambday: so the nice thing about the null approximations is that we have ground truth (permutation test)
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, will ask my friends for one
@HeikoS	as every is using max that should be possible
 lambday	HeikoS: well, it was giving weird results.. in the statistic_linear_time_mmd.py test, p-value was coming out to be weird (more than 0.5)...
@HeikoS	lambday: that should be checked
 lambday	HeikoS: and the test failed to detect that p!=q
@HeikoS	lambday: which nul approximation was that?
 lambday	HeikoS: with both
 lambday	but I changed the seed and it was fine
 lambday	in fact, with more samples, it always succeeds
@HeikoS	lambday: what about a unit (or even python) test that compares the null approximations?
@HeikoS	to ground truth (permutation) one
@HeikoS	lambday: since as long as the statistic is computed correctly, te permutation test is correct
@HeikoS	and this p-value issue seems werd
@HeikoS	weird
@HeikoS	though, if changing the seed solves the issue, this might be a problem of not having enough data
 lambday	HeikoS: yep.. I was stuck with this for quite a long time but didn't understand what was going so fishy... I mean,... I am just streaming more blocks at once
 lambday	shouldn't make such difference.
@wiking	wtf is this: SGSparseVector.cpp line 395: Computing sparse_dot(a,b) on unsorted vectors is very expensive: O(n^2)
 lambday	yes that's what I figured finally
 lambday	compared streamed features by both earlier method and current method
@wiking	lambday: ^
 lambday	HeikoS: and what you mean by comparing null approximation.. I guess its already done in existing python tests
 lambday	wiking: umm.. I did that? let me check
 lambday	wiking: sorry man I didn't write this code... :(

 lambday	wiking: but having a hashmap it can be improved I guess :/
 HeikoS1	lambday: ah yeah, that might be true. I think I did that before
 HeikoS1	wiking: ask thoralf about that, we introduced it

 HeikoS1	lambday, wiking I think this method is fallback and should be avoided
 HeikoS1	thats why the warning
@wiking	HeikoS1: :)))) but afaik it's wrong because the features are sorted
@wiking	or i have to figure out wtf is happening
 HeikoS1	wiking: I see, well that might be true.
 HeikoS1	wiking: would be good to find the reason
 HeikoS1	wiking: did you get the scripts from sonne|work or besser82 yet?
@wiking	nada
 HeikoS1	rrr

 HeikoS1	wiking: whats weheel?
 lambday	HeikoS1: alright :)
@wiking	HeikoS1: http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
 HeikoS1	wiking: so pip install
 HeikoS1	wiking: nice!
 HeikoS1	super nice!
 lambday	HeikoS1: btw did you happen to take a look at the class diagram for feature selection? it works as a subclass of CDimensionReductionPreprocessor
 HeikoS1	lambday: not yet but about to
 lambday	HeikoS1: Dino suggested that we should also think about three-variable interaction ... but I think we need another subclass for that
 HeikoS1	lambday: one thing: do we want to use DenseFeatures as subclass?
 HeikoS1	lambday: yes, thats subclass
 lambday	HeikoS1: that's the point - we don't need to :/
 lambday	well, no
 HeikoS1	lambday: I think it would be cooler to allow doing this for other features types
 HeikoS1	lambday: at least sparse
 HeikoS1	lambday: though I dont know of any algorithms for that :;D
 HeikoS1	wiking: sparse feature selection?
 HeikoS1	wiking: or more precise: feature selection on sparse data
@wiking	HeikoS1: well i would need a lot of shit sparsed
@wiking	:))
 lambday	HeikoS1: wiking ws worried about that :D
@wiking	HeikoS1: like why p-norm is only working currently in shogun for densefeatures?
@wiking	totally bullshit
@wiking	HeikoS1: btw what's the eta for a gaussian binary GP for a sparse feature dataset with 60k training examples? :)
@wiking	should i try even? :)
@wiking	libsvm with gaussian kernel is running for ages already
 HeikoS1	wiking: 60k
 HeikoS1	crash :)
@wiking	hehehe ok
 lambday	HeikoS1: errr... travis failed in git submodule update :/ could you please restart the build? :(
 HeikoS1	wiking: GP need to invert the covariance matrix which in this case doesnt fit into memory
 HeikoS1	lambday: I think you can do that too
 HeikoS1	no?
 lambday	HeikoS1: via web interface?
 HeikoS1	lambday: yes in travis, press "sign in with github" and then you can start/stop jobs
 lambday	HeikoS1: alright.. cool
 HeikoS1	wiking: for such a large amount of data, I would go for SVM or even KRR
@wiking	HeikoS1: is it possible to horizontally scale the inversion of the cov matrix ?
 HeikoS1	wiking: horizontally?
 HeikoS1	wiking: one can scale up these things quite a bit
@wiking	i.e. run it distributed
 HeikoS1	wiking: but not in the naive (current) implementation
 HeikoS1	wiking: there are SGD variants of this
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.222.13.170] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 HeikoS1	and variational methods, but not in Shogun
 HeikoS1	wiking: Wu is working on nice things for that
 HeikoS1	wiking: but all not really large
 HeikoS1	wiking: maybe next year :)
@wiking	that's why i'm asking
@wiking	would it be possible to run that distributed
@wiking	like MR (map-reduce)
 HeikoS1	wiking: probably there exist some things for that
 HeikoS1	this one here is also very interesting:
 HeikoS1	wiking: http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5029
 HeikoS1	super nice
 HeikoS1	we should have that
 HeikoS1	a few things can be done map-reduce like in Shogun
 HeikoS1	grid-search for SVM
 HeikoS1	x-validation
 HeikoS1	this KRR
 HeikoS1	maybe a GP
@wiking	oh fuck
@wiking	this scipy.sparse -> SparseRealFeatures conversion does not work the best
 HeikoS1	wiking: haha ,whenever one starts using Shogun, this is what happens ;)
@wiking	but WTF
@wiking	it's just unacceptable that we cannot mix scipy.sparse and shogun's sparse
 lambday	wiking: it works fine for logdet examples :/
@wiking	lambday: RealSparseMatrixOperator ?
@wiking	lambday: how should i feed that for GaussianKernel? :)
 lambday	wiking: well you don't need to use that
 lambday	wait I'm checking
 lambday	wiking:
 lambday	you need SparseRealFeatures working, right?
 lambday	so this works -
 lambday	from modshogun import SparseRealFeatures
 lambday	from scipy.sparse import eye
 lambday	A=eye(10,10)
 lambday	 f=SparseRealFeatures(A.tocsc())
@wiking	lambday: A.T.tocsc() i suppose
@wiking	i mean in case of eye it doesn't matter
@wiking	but any other sane dataset would require to have the .T
 lambday	wiking: well, yes..
 lambday	but this should work, right?
@wiking	yeah seems liek that
@wiking	it seems fucking sklearn is making crazy sutff
@wiking	*stuff
 lambday	crazy good or...?
@wiking	it reverts the order of the sparse vector values
 lambday	reverts as in?
@wiking	well i have 0:1 123:1 222:2 ...
@wiking	and when i do this

@wiking	or?
@wiking	i.e. sparse -> dense matrix conversion

@HeikoS	lambday: cool! :)
@HeikoS	lambday: will soon take a much closer look to the feature selection stuiff you wrote down

@HeikoS	pickle27: hey!
 pickle27	hey!
 pickle27	did you get the demos working?
@HeikoS	pickle27: nope
@HeikoS	the server runs
@HeikoS	but it just echos my browsers requests
 pickle27	hmm what is it complaining about
@HeikoS	pickle27: see pm
@HeikoS	how do I get a list of demos, or link to find them behind?
@HeikoS	the ones in the readme dont work
 pickle27	so the program boots the django web server
 pickle27	if you want to use it you need to go to localhost:8000 I think
 pickle27	oh except you don't know what the urls are
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	pickle27: so as said, my terminal prints my browser requests
@HeikoS	but I dont know what to do now
 pickle27	the urls.py maps urls to python functions
 pickle27	so if you look at the first one
 pickle27	regression/svr/
 pickle27	localhost:8000/regression/svr/ should run the code in the regression.svr.handler function
 pickle27	man I hate django
 pickle27	so ugly
 pickle27	is that working for you?
@HeikoS	pickle27: kind of
@HeikoS	it doesnt look right
@HeikoS	not like on our website
@HeikoS	and buttons dont do things
@HeikoS	pickle27: could you try on your machine?
@HeikoS	maybe something is wrong with my setup ?
 pickle27	I don't have django setup on here unfortunately
 pickle27	I haven't ever played with the demo app
 pickle27	for starters it should be flask too and not django ...
 pickle27	maybe I'll do that some day soon
 pickle27	I *really* hate how hard it is to clone any of our web repos and work on them
 pickle27	waaaaay to much config specific to the exact server running those apps
 pickle27	are you trying to add a new demo?
@HeikoS	pickle27: I agree with you
@HeikoS	pickle27: I try to inspect what Saurabh did
 pickle27	ahh gotcha
@HeikoS	He added some really nice stuff
@HeikoS	but I cannot check it
 pickle27	maybe he can help you more?
 pickle27	I'll port that app to flask someday soon
@HeikoS	pickle27: yes I asked him already but just had some time
 pickle27	things will be better
 pickle27	flask == simple django == gross
@HeikoS	the application basically doesnt run here
@HeikoS	just prints the text and renders all buttons/boxes
@HeikoS	but nothing happens in the back
@HeikoS	pickle27: cool sounds good. I mean this should be easy to use
 pickle27	yeah exactly
 pickle27	flask is the perfect framework for our stuff
 pickle27	it has almost zero conceptual overhead to deal with in order to work with it
@HeikoS	ok
