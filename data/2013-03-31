 shogun-buildbot	build #339 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/339

 ZeThomas	hey I have some trouble making a custom kernel
 blackburn	ZeThomas: hey what is the problem?
 ZeThomas	I basically have my own object types, and defined a function that gives the k(.,.) values on two of those
 blackburn	alright
 ZeThomas	I am able to then make a shogun kernel by subclassing one, and populating the matrix myself
 blackburn	are you using python btw?
 ZeThomas	but I am now at loss as to how I would use apply() on my SVM(Light), since it asks for a feature object
 ZeThomas	yes, modshogun
 blackburn	there is a feature of swig called directors
 blackburn	basically you define your own kernel
 blackburn	and shogun uses your python code to compute values
 blackburn	(it would be good if you wouldn't like to populate whole matrix)
 ZeThomas	(i only populate upper triangle ofcourse :) )
 ZeThomas	oh, ok, how do I do this exactly then?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: first 1) configure with --enable-swig-directors
 blackburn	2) https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/python_modular/kernel_director_linear_modular.py
 blackburn	ZeThomas: most interesting for you is class at line 15
 ZeThomas	blackburn: so I recompile
 ZeThomas	?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes
 blackburn	ZeThomas: so you don't use shogun features to store the data right?
 ZeThomas	no, indeed
 blackburn	ZeThomas: alright then everything would look like in that example
 blackburn	except lines 19 and 20
 blackburn	ZeThomas: so you define a class that implements def kernel_function(self, idx_a, idx_b):
 ZeThomas	so after the recompile, I get a class named DirectorKernel that I subclass?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: exactly
 blackburn	ZeThomas: if you pass that class as kernel to svmlight
 blackburn	it will call the code you write
 ZeThomas	and how do I train/test?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: well you may add any methods you'd need to handle that
 blackburn	ZeThomas: you may also use DummyFeatures(N)
 blackburn	where N is the number of vectors
 blackburn	ZeThomas: so the workflow would be
 blackburn	1) set data on your kernel and init the kernel with kernel.init(DummyFeatures(n_train_vectors),DummyFeatures(n_train_vectors))
 blackburn	2) train the machine

 blackburn	3) set your kernel for testing somehow and call kernel.init(DummyFeatures(n_train_vectors),DummyFeatures(n_test_vectors))

 ZeThomas	hey sorry, I got disconnected
 ZeThomas	ok, wait, I'm still a bit confused; do I manually provide the (upper) Gram matrix?
 ZeThomas	and 2) (how) do I call apply() on my svm, and can I still extract the values from the result (get_values())?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes everything related to svm stays the same
 blackburn	ZeThomas: about first q - you do provide a function that computes k(idx_a,idx_b)
 blackburn	where idx_a and idx_b are in [0,n_train_vectors] when training
 blackburn	and idx_b is in [0,n_test_vectors] when testing

 lambday	blackburn: hi..
 blackburn	lambday: hey
 lambday	I was was writing a unit test for sparse matrix cholesky factorization... what could be a good test case?
 blackburn	lambday: well you may check if after factorization L*LT is still the original matrix
 lambday	blackburn: umm... yes
 lambday	well, actually it permutes the original matrix before factorization so that it results in sparser factors...
 lambday	so, P -1 * L * LT * P will give original matrix
 blackburn	lambday: yeah or that
 lambday	blackburn: hmm .. thanks.. :)
