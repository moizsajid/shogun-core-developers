 taylan	Good morning again..
 taylan	I had an insufficient memory error a couple of days ago, and I tried to reproduce this with libshogun as well..
 taylan	The grid search tries to allocate 16 GB of memory, which fails of course..
 taylan	Reproduceing is quite easy, you just need to increase the num_vectors to 20000 and dim_vectors to 7 in  examples/undocumented/libshogun/modelselection_grid_search_kernel.cpp

 taylan	No problem, I think we are allocating a memory for a matrix of size 20Kx20K..
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.179.49] has joined #shogun
 taylan	which is called from CustomKernel.h
 taylan	set_full_kernel_matrix_from_full
@lisitsyn	taylan: oh that's quite possible
 taylan	well, so we can't in theory handle this, since 20Kx20Kx8 = 3.2 GB
 taylan	Is there any plan to introduce memory mapped files maybe?
 taylan	I am not sure if this will resolve the issue though..

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we shouldn't be using a custom kernel in the first place for that
@sonney2k	besser82, any cmake news?
 besser82	sonney2k: not yet will open a PR when ready  ;)
@sonney2k	taylan, just use     cross->set_autolock(false); then it will work
@lisitsyn	ahhh autolock
-!- new_lido is now known as new_lido_afk
 taylan	sonney2k, thanks for the hint..
 taylan	can you explain what this does, just to kill my ignorance abit..
@sonney2k	taylan, not precompute the kernel matrix
@sonney2k	so things will fit in memory
 taylan	thanks a lot..and we do precompute for performance reasons?
@sonney2k	taylan, yes

@wiking	sonney2k: what do u mean w/o shogun dir available?
@wiking	sonney2k: u mean libshogun src and only the .h files?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes no src/shogun available but only the installed headers
@sonney2k	wiking, I looked at the fPIC detection ... there must be a smarter way but I couldn't find it
@wiking	sonney2k: well this one is better than the previous hardcoded one ;)
@wiking	but go ahead with a better patch
@wiking	sonney2k: the problem is that from now on we have to depend to have cmake 2.8.8+
@sonney2k	wiking, no problem with that
@sonney2k	wiking, I was searching the web already
@sonney2k	didn't find any better solution for fPIC
@wiking	i've just upgraded cmake in precise so that it runs good as well on that bot ...
@sonney2k	wiking, but I can tell that this won't help for this here https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun
@sonney2k	I guess powerpc is also fPIC but no idea about e.g. s390 or sparc or mips
@wiking	sonney2k: ain't got no access for those archs ;)
@wiking	so have no idea
@wiking	shogun-buildbot_: force build --branch=develop 'precise - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot_	build forced [ETA 27m35s]
 shogun-buildbot_	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	wiking, well shogun will be built on them so we will see...

 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeah seen that in news
 lisitsyn1	wiking: have you glanced over it?
@wiking	yep
 lisitsyn1	I planned to do later
@wiking	it's really basic building blocks
 lisitsyn1	anything interesting?
@wiking	like openmax
@wiking	well it's gonna be nice
@wiking	when there are such fpgas or cpu parts
@wiking	so that u can call those via this api
@wiking	and have it in one instruction
@wiking	;P
@wiking	other than that... i think we should start working on moving things into separate dlls
@wiking	and have something like a pipeline
@wiking	gstreamer et. al. style
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeash!
@wiking	let's sketch up
@wiking	there are input readers
@wiking	which transform the input into some Feature type
@wiking	on which we can apply preprocessors
@wiking	and then those can be piped into some machine
@wiking	i think i should catch Ed to pin-point us some things to avoid when we would do this

@wiking	yey
 lisitsyn1	and don't say I have self identity crysis I know
@wiking	yeah actually stuff like this would be amaazing
@wiking	/opt/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgsttheora.so
@wiking	meaning we wouldn't create a big fuckiing bundle
@wiking	but each component would be a dynloadable stuff
@wiking	i wonder how swig would actually handle this part :S
 lisitsyn1	wiking: absolutely no idea about that but I am quite pessimistic
 lisitsyn1	swig is quite troublesome sometimes you know
 lisitsyn1	there is nothing else though
@wiking	lisitsyn1: well apart from swig
@wiking	actually we are quite prepared to do this
@wiking	because we have like kazzillion abstract classes
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeah
 lisitsyn1	we should convert to something like d-ptrs everywhere

@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	good luck have fun :)
 lisitsyn1	wiking: haha well that's how it should be done
@wiking	yeah true
@wiking	dpointers + gstreamer dynload pipelining
@wiking	and then we are happy i guess
@wiking	but then again sonney2k is doing a better approach
@wiking	by making a deb package
@wiking	trust me that's like 100% more needed than a fucking usuable sw
@wiking	:D
@wiking	but when we do gsoc next year
@wiking	we should have 2 slots that actually does some sw architecturing on shogun
@wiking	instead of adding a new component

 lisitsyn1	wiking: heh students doing sw architectures?
@wiking	well supoprting
@wiking	so that let's say we want dpointers
@wiking	it's not that high IQ stuff to do
@wiking	but it cannot really be done by only scripting
 lisitsyn1	wiking: ah well that's easy job yes
@wiking	so i think a student could do that easily

@sonney2k	wiking, is cmake failing on travis due to the cmake .8 requirement?
@wiking	yepey
@wiking	sonney2k: there's a backport in this repo
@wiking	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
@wiking	this has 2.8.9 cmake
@wiking	so that should be added to .travis.yml in a smart way
@sonney2k	wiking, ok I see.
@sonney2k	wiking, I thought about what you said above
@sonney2k	wiking, if I know how to split up shogun I would love to
@sonney2k	wiking, problem is indeed swig - we cannot split that up at all
@sonney2k	wiking, we must in the end have just 1 modshogun for swig interfaces
@sonney2k	nevertheless considering the autotools rule, 1 dir == 1 module is imho the way to go
@sonney2k	*but*
@sonney2k	we should have d-ptrs first - otherwise the swig module is a nightmare

@sonney2k	wiking, ah btw swig supports modules but I had crashes back then in some of the interfaces (it did work in python though but wrapped code size in total was bigger like 2 times)
@wiking	:S
@sonney2k	wiking, as in we really had a shogun.Kernel module
@sonney2k	(that is why the examples are still like this)
@sonney2k	and a shogun.Features module
@sonney2k	but since Kernels need to be aware of features you had to make everything known in there
@sonney2k	that is very difficult to do right
