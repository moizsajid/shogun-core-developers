@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh I got an answer at the swig mailinglist
 blackburn	sonney2k: about?
@sonney2k	reducing wrapper size
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	basically 'do you really need to include all headers'?
 blackburn	and what's the question?
@sonney2k	so what do we do now?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sorry
 blackburn	question^Wanswer
 blackburn	all ?
@sonney2k	blackburn,
@sonney2k	The only real support for this problem is %import with multiple modules.
@sonney2k	All target languages should work with multiple modules. Some might not,
@sonney2k	but then consider it a bug in a major area which should be fixed. The
@sonney2k	-fvirtual and -fcompact options you refer to offer some reduction, but
@sonney2k	nothing really large. You could alternatively wrap less code, do you
@sonney2k	really need all of the code wrapped?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no idea what we could 'un'wrap
 shogun-buildbot	build #38 of nightly_default is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/38
@sonney2k	blackburn, grep template * | wc -l
@sonney2k	257
@sonney2k	so if we support instead of 11 datatypes just 2 or 3
@sonney2k	we get down to ~60 %template's
@sonney2k	my suggestion would be we add a --datatypes= switch to configure
@sonney2k	and default it to very few types
@sonney2k	say float/double/uint8
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r6f2007f / src/shogun/io/File.h : add a get_file_descriptor() function to File - http://git.io/LZUFLA
 blackburn	sonney2k: +1
 blackburn	sonney2k: you could just make it -regular-datatypes -extended-datatypes or so
@sonney2k	*arg* our example data has train and test data
@sonney2k	but only train label
@sonney2k	no *test* ones
@sonney2k	:(
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * rd651da1 / examples/undocumented/octave_modular/classifier_svm_serialize_modular.m :
 CIA-3	shogun: add example for svm serialization and octave.
 CIA-3	shogun: thanks Michael Herrmann for the contribution - http://git.io/b4UcgA
 blackburn	sonney2k: when do you think we can make it 1.1ed?
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	what do you think?
 blackburn	sonney2k: middle of november?
@sonney2k	I mean did you check for bugs?
 blackburn	sonney2k: what exactly?
@sonney2k	whether test suite still works?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm I didn't
@sonney2k	in principle we could release now
 blackburn	no-no
@sonney2k	at least examples run again and buildbot is happy
@sonney2k	but the question is what do we want to have finished
@sonney2k	for example
@sonney2k	should 1.1. compile under cygwin ?
@sonney2k	osx?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have two more algos to finish
@sonney2k	do we want to limit resources needed to compile shogun?
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	then there is the .h -> .cpp inline migration
 blackburn	sonney2k: so how do you estimate date?
@sonney2k	still lots of work todo for that
@sonney2k	however we could in principle release any time as long as we don't introduce regressions
 blackburn	sonney2k: well there are always a lot of work
@sonney2k	exactly
 blackburn	but we have to release sometimes :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I propose to do:
 blackburn	reduce size
 blackburn	check for regressions
 blackburn	finish two my algos
 blackburn	hmm.. that's all?
@sonney2k	cygwin / osx
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	the only problem I see is that we don't have migrations working
 blackburn	sonney2k: which migrations/
@sonney2k	so your layout change might introduce non readable objects
 blackburn	??
@sonney2k	serialization!
 blackburn	layout change?
@sonney2k	converter!
 blackburn	ehmm how can it produce non-readable objects?
 blackburn	I don't think someone ever saved say LLE or LTSA :D
@sonney2k	if someone uses a preprocessor from your LLE code
@sonney2k	lets hope so
 blackburn	sonney2k: the only thing available to save is k parameter
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	nothing else
 blackburn	sonney2k: all algos I've implemented are embedding methods, not transforming like PCA
 blackburn	there is really nothing to save
 shogun-buildbot	build #302 of octave_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/302  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	sonney2k: soon I will get up to that drtoolbox with 343423432432 methods :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I thought that guy over there had ~30 dr methods or so?
@sonney2k	or 50 even
 blackburn	sonney2k: most of them are useless and he treats Isomap and Landmark Isomap as different algos
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not have any iterative algos
 blackburn	and plan to continue this way
@sonney2k	what are examples for iterative algos?
 blackburn	sonney2k: t-sne, sammon mapping
 blackburn	manifold sculpting, etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: I believe only in eigenmagic :D
@sonney2k	do you know what SERIALIZABLE_DUMMY is?
 blackburn	ehhh
 blackburn	no
 shogun-buildbot	build #237 of octave_modular is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/237  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 shogun-buildbot	build #220 of r_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_modular/builds/220
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r06a4899 / examples/undocumented/octave_modular/classifier_svm_serialize_modular.m : fix typo : -> ; - http://git.io/fszKHg
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r58f986e / (6 files in 2 dirs):
 CIA-3	shogun: build shogun's interfaces by default only for a limited set of data types
 CIA-3	shogun: namely char,uint8_t,uint16_t,uint64_t,float32_t,float64_t - http://git.io/1G_3ww
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok we are down to 375kLoC (from 531kLoC)
@sonney2k	when compiling with datatypes=char,uint8_t,uint16_t,uint64_t,float32_t,float64_t
@sonney2k	but examples use all types...
@sonney2k	so it is only a poor mans solution
@sonney2k	but yes better than nothing
