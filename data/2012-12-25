@sonney2k	wiking, I hope you are happy now
@sonney2k	heiko, wiking  - should we have some release plan for 2.1.0?
 heiko	sonney2k, sorry just saw this
 heiko	sonney2k, yes good idea
 heiko	what should be in there then?
@sonney2k	heiko, just the stuff we currently have... but some more stabilization I guess
 heiko	sonney2k, ok, I am still working on this kernel selection stuff, at least I plan to do so, and there were a few bugs: streaming features, model-selection (kristinas mail), etc
 heiko	what else is going on?
@sonney2k	heiko, not sure if you have seen but I have moved most of the unrelated stuff from CMath -> to SGVector etc
@sonney2k	and added load/save stuff to sgvecttor/sgmatrix etc
 heiko	yes I saw that
 Dark_Lantern	Hello everybody
 heiko	what about the unit testing, any progress in that?
 heiko	hi Dark_Lantern
 Dark_Lantern	I am kinda new to open source development
@sonney2k	I would wish I could get Sparse/Stringfeatures to work with the new SGdata types
@sonney2k	but I am not there yet
@sonney2k	Dark_Lantern, hi!
 Dark_Lantern	Any way for me to get started contributing to shogun?
 Dark_Lantern	Any advice
 Dark_Lantern	like any bugs or issues?
@sonney2k	Dark_Lantern, if you miss some algorithm/documention/find some bug tell us or even write it yourself and supply it to us
 Dark_Lantern	I can help with the Classification trees that lisitsyn is doing. :)
 Dark_Lantern	I have a good idea about ID3
 Dark_Lantern	and I can read up on C4.5
 heiko	id3 is a good thing to have
@sonney2k	Dark_Lantern, yeah would be a very welcome addition
 heiko	random forests would also be nice, but thats a bigger project :)
 Dark_Lantern	has lisitsyn started anything?
@sonney2k	as would C5.0 ...
@sonney2k	Dark_Lantern, I don't think so
 Dark_Lantern	oh ok :)
 Dark_Lantern	I have just built the source
 Dark_Lantern	but I still have to get a hang of the code
 Dark_Lantern	Was browsing through the features source today
 Dark_Lantern	Hope you guys don't mind while I explore a bit first?
 heiko	Dark_Lantern, sure, thats the best way to start, browse through stuff
 heiko	try to understand the files that are related to your ideas
@sonney2k	Dark_Lantern, well first start using shogun then you will notice what is missing/can be improved and start with that :)
 Dark_Lantern	That is the right way I guess #sonney2k
