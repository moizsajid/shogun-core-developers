@sonney2k	pluskid, wiking did you manage to git rebase or to this filter-branch'd repository?
 CIA-113	shogun: Chiyuan Zhang master * r2c0ea33 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_multiclass_ecoc.py : exclude abstract class from testing. - http://git.io/wV23Kw
 CIA-113	shogun: Chiyuan Zhang master * r1983da0 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/evaluation_clustering.py : Fix evaluation_clustering error. - http://git.io/FCthiQ
 CIA-113	shogun: Chiyuan Zhang master * rd3e4418 / .gitignore : added temp files generated when running python_modular examples to gitignore - http://git.io/FhWKbw
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r3f61978 / (3 files in 2 dirs): Merge pull request #549 from pluskid/multiclass - http://git.io/tHxyhQ
 pluskid	sonney2k: what filter-branch'd repo? I did a completely new fork as stated in the mail
@sonney2k	pluskid, yes exactly that is what you had to do
@sonney2k	but your pull request needs to be 'rebased' I guess format-patch is the only option
 pluskid	sonney2k: which pull request? You just merged them, as CIA-113 said above
@sonney2k	pluskid, I merged one
@sonney2k	not the other
 pluskid	the other ? let me see
 pluskid	oh... just forget about that one
 pluskid	I guess I have re-write the code in that pull request
 pluskid	I deleted my previous fork repo and thought I lost them
@sonney2k	pluskid, ok
@sonney2k	pluskid, btw do you know these 2 cool multiclass papers?
 pluskid	which ones?
 pluskid	I'm doing a survey these days
@sonney2k	"ShareBoost: Efficient Multiclass Learning with
@sonney2k	Feature Sharing" by Shalev-Shwartz et al"ShareBoost: Efficient Multiclass Learning with
@sonney2k	Feature Sharing" by Shalev-Shwartz et al
 pluskid	oh, this one is mentioned in the GSoC idea page of shogun :D
@sonney2k	"Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for
@sonney2k	Large Scale Object Recognition" by Deng et al
 pluskid	this one, too
 pluskid	thanks all the same!
@sonney2k	pluskid, both are nips papers from last years NIPS
@sonney2k	yes these two
@sonney2k	I talked to the authors last year and I think these could be really useful
 pluskid	yeah, I did brief scanning of them before, I'll try to dig deeper this week
 pluskid	sonney2k: oh, cool!
@sonney2k	pluskid, I don't know how far you are with the general ECOC library conversion
@sonney2k	maybe these 2 are good candidates for july or so
 pluskid	sonney2k: I have translated most part
 pluskid	of ecoclib
@sonney2k	then june :D
@sonney2k	pluskid, learning ECOC is not really helping
@sonney2k	gunnar (from shoGUN) tried that once
@sonney2k	but it didn't help
@sonney2k	or almost not
 pluskid	hmm
@sonney2k	nips paper still...
 pluskid	I have the same feeling (though I didn't do really rigious experiments)
@sonney2k	pluskid, so *I* would rather go for other promising MC approaches
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	got to leave train
@sonney2k	brb
 pluskid	yeah, I'm doing a survey to collect and category related algorithms
 pluskid	I'll also discuss with Cheng the next week
 pluskid	after I finished a rough survey
 pluskid	about which algorithm to go next

 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * re59e42f / (.gitignore src/interfaces/modular/Machine.i): %rename apply of any type and include Makefile in gitignore - http://git.io/R5dMMA
 sonne|work	pluskid: the other idea I had is to look at the LSHTC
 sonne|work	pluskid: this one http://lshtc.iit.demokritos.gr/
 sonne|work	they had lots of submissions / papers last / this year
 pluskid	sonne|work: cool
 sonne|work	but they usually heavily make use of structure in the data (hierachies aka trees)
 pluskid	hmm, so we'd better also remind n4nd0
 sonne|work	so maybe the winning entry from last year might be interesteing
 sonne|work	pluskid: but it is not SO - right?
 sonne|work	multiclass/multitask
 pluskid	oh, you mean the structure in X?
 sonne|work	pluskid: no in y
 sonne|work	you know that there is a hierarchy
 pluskid	then that belongs to SO I guess
 sonne|work	I guess you can see it that way - or you can see it the ECOC or so way
 sonne|work	having trees of classifiersx
 sonne|work	matching the hierarchy
 pluskid	hmm, that makes sense
-!- nickon [~noneedtok@kotnet-147.kulnet.kuleuven.be] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	multiclass/multitask/multilabel...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: oh, how did that happen to the pull request? I don't remember I pushed any changes yesterday
 n4nd0	pluskid: hey!
 n4nd0	about this issue of doing the fork again, did you manage to rebase or have you just forked the repo again?
 pluskid	n4nd0: I forked again
 pluskid	things a totally messy
 pluskid	I don't know what they have done yesterday
 pluskid	they are horrible crazy horses :D
 n4nd0	:D
 sonne|work	the crazy_{horses,russians} recreated the whole repository
 sonne|work	everything is invalid basically
 n4nd0	O_O that sounds pretty bad
 sonne|work	we had to do this because of blackburns accidental merge some huuuuge data sets
 n4nd0	I see
 sonne|work	n4nd0: just do a fresh clone
 sonne|work	and then everything is good again
 sonne|work	shogun .git dir is now ~30MB
 n4nd0	yeah, I am on my way :)
 sonne|work	not 158 :)
 n4nd0	that's nice
 n4nd0	but I need to delete my fork in github as well, right?
 pluskid	I did that
 n4nd0	there's no problem with unmerged branches?
 pluskid	I think they will lost if you delete the repo
 n4nd0	I have my branch so that has not been merged into the repo
 n4nd0	yeah ... that's too bad :S
 pluskid	maybe you have to backup them with git-format-patch and re-apply them when the new fork is created
 n4nd0	I was thinking of that
 n4nd0	kind of *not very* comfortable though
 n4nd0	but anyway ...
 pluskid	don't know of any easier way
 n4nd0	sonne|work: do you know any alternative?
 n4nd0	otherwise, I will start doing it
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well that is pretty easy imho
 sonne|work	use git format patch
 sonne|work	you don't need to delete your fork you need to force push at some point
 sonne|work	but keep a copy of what you had before...
 n4nd0	sure
 pluskid	any in the university network with springer subscription help me to download this paper?
 pluskid	http://www.springerlink.com/content/n30xeen83d81ylbu/?MUD=MP
 pluskid	Thanks!
 sonne|work	pluskid: http://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CEgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhunch.net%2F~beygel%2Fsecoc.ps&ei=gKS8T4OGDtSm8gPbl5gj&usg=AFQjCNHBUHtQ01KMZ3320-S9YJSLLvCwyw
 sonne|work	pluskid: or just google the title
 sonne|work	you will find it at hunch
 sonne|work	(JL's homepage)
 pluskid	sonne|work: ah, thanks
 pluskid	I had this .ps file, but fonts looks a bit strange
 pluskid	in my box
 pluskid	so I'm seeking a PDF
 sonne|work	pluskid: there is also the .pdf
 sonne|work	IIRC second google hit
 pluskid	OK, I'll google it
 sonne|work	pluskid: yes this one http://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CFcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhunch.net%2F~jl%2Fprojects%2Freductions%2Fpecoc%2Ffinal%2Fsecoc.pdf&ei=FKW8T8iNEpTx8QOz38Fl&usg=AFQjCNHITbB2AYcizO_r31aO00FB8KcLzA
 pluskid	haha, that is the one with strange font
 pluskid	too
 pluskid	anyway, I will go with this
 pluskid	but if anyone have access to the COLT official copy, it would be nicer
 n4nd0	pluskid: I have tried over ssh to my university but I got ERROR 403: Forbidden, sorry
 pluskid	n4nd0: OK, thanks anyway!
 n4nd0	I can try later when I get there in any case again
 n4nd0	I have never found a problem to get a paper being there
 pluskid	n4nd0: cool!
 n4nd0	John Langford is the author
 n4nd0	it seems that he's done lot of stuff!!
 pluskid	yes!

 n4nd0	by the way, what about the warnings in DynamicArray and SGMatrix
 n4nd0	should we get rid of them?
 blackburn	which warnings?
 pluskid	operator[] ?
 blackburn	ah it should be ignored
 n4nd0	why?
 n4nd0	I get *a lot* of ../../shogun/lib/DynamicArray.h:296: Warning 516: Overloaded method shogun::CDynamicArray< uint64_t >::element(int32_t) ignored,
 blackburn	n4nd0: ??
 n4nd0	and also the can't wrap operator ones
 blackburn	is your git up to date?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 n4nd0	it might be something mine if you don't see them
 blackburn	n4nd0: iirc gsomix fixed those ones
 pluskid	sth like this: ../../shogun/lib/SGVector.h:193: Warning 389: operator[] ignored (consider using %extend)
 pluskid	not *too* many though
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Read error: Operation timed out]
 blackburn	operator[] should be ignored in modular I think
 blackburn	hmm it is already ignored
 n4nd0	this is part of how it looks for me
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ujfR2
 n4nd0	lot of them are the same errors repeated
 n4nd0	is that something mine?
 n4nd0	it is everything new
 n4nd0	github fork, the local clone, and in master
 blackburn	that's strange
 n4nd0	I am going for lunch, I'll be back later
 blackburn	ok I removed a few
 CIA-113	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rba81d43 / (2 files): Ignored {=,*,(),[]}operators in modular - http://git.io/TZ5WGQ

@sonney2k	blackburn of course

@sonney2k	you never know... :)
@sonney2k	karlnapf, yeah please praise me more ... took me hours ...
 karlnapf	all hail sonney2k for cleaning the git logs :) :) :)
 karlnapf	year, shogun is so much faster than matlab
@sonney2k	karlnapf, doing what?
 karlnapf	comparing performance of code in matlab and my shogun implementation
 karlnapf	well its no surprise, nested loops
@sonney2k	karlnapf, well that is kind of unfair
@sonney2k	you need to compare it to vectorized code :)
 karlnapf	I know :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, if you are interested, have a look into the test classes I made
 karlnapf	I think the structure is quite nice like this
 karlnapf	Will add some examples how to use them (ultra easy) soon
 karlnapf	gotta go now, studying ...

 n4nd0	I turned out not to be so straightforward to apply the patches this morning :(
