 sp1rit	Hi guys, I'm having trouble running any program after installing shogun 2.0 on my CentOS 6.3..I did have no trouble doing configure, make and make install. But when it comes to running an experimental program, it returns error msg: "ImportError: No module named sg"
 sp1rit	I'm totally new to shogun&CentOS so I don't have a clue why shogun module is not loaded...
 sp1rit	Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 blackburn	hey
 sp1rit	hey :)
 blackburn	why sg?
 sp1rit	while I'm trying to run a python program:
 blackburn	you are using python modular right?
 sp1rit	src]$ python ../examples/documented/python_static/graphical/svm_classification.py
 sp1rit	Traceback (most recent call last):
 sp1rit	  File "../examples/documented/python_static/graphical/svm_classification.py", line 1, in <module>
 sp1rit	    from sg import sg
 sp1rit	ImportError: No module named sg
 sp1rit	yeah I'm trying it
 blackburn	wait, so how did you configure it?
 sp1rit	I did it the default way
 sp1rit	./configure
 blackburn	I don't recommend to start with static interfaces
 sp1rit	OK...I was trying to follow the installation guide..
 blackburn	it is kind of deprecated
 sp1rit	oh that's good to know
 blackburn	so lets configure for python_modular
 blackburn	./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 sp1rit	running it :)
 sp1rit	Checking for Python/Python Numpy Developer Files ... no
 sp1rit	Error: python/numpy developer files missing
 sp1rit	hmm ;(
 blackburn	yeah it would require some additional packages
 blackburn	I am not really into centos so let me google it
 sp1rit	thanks :)
 blackburn	probably you need python-devel package
 blackburn	sp1rit: is there such package to install?
