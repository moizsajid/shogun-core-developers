 blackburn	whoa
 blackburn	built
 n4nd0	hurray!
 blackburn	n4nd0: it fails on runtime though :D
 n4nd0	damn it
 n4nd0	blackburn: what's the problem?
 blackburn	n4nd0: parser I guess
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please paste swissroll data somewhere?

 alexlovesdata	It looks in github like  I did not so any??
 n4nd0	hey alexlovesdata
 n4nd0	I think you did it
 n4nd0	check here
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/901
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: is it that one the one you were looking for?
 alexlovesdata	ye ... thank Fernando ... I just did not see the pull request in github and so I wondered whether I was dreaming two nights ago at 4 am
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: maybe you were looking in your fork of shogun here
 n4nd0	https://github.com/AlexBinder/shogun
 n4nd0	while the pull request appears in the repository where you want to introduce the code, in this cade the one by shogun-toolbox user
 alexlovesdata	yes, I was looking there indeed ..

 n4nd0	blackburn: any idea what is from the cover tree that makes it fail?
 blackburn	n4nd0: will try to debug later
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please try to fix current build error?
 blackburn	I have no linux around
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me see
 blackburn	it fails to link - I have done something wrong in CMakeLists
 blackburn	n4nd0: around line 30 :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: last commit was it right?
 blackburn	n4nd0: last commit was an atttempt to fix it
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	blackburn: this is the error I get
 n4nd0	cmake: error while loading shared libraries: libarchive.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	never seen that
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe so that was not the bug you meant?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://travis-ci.org/lisitsyn/tapkee/jobs/5222900
 n4nd0	blackburn: or the error ^ must be someting mine, let me try
 blackburn	n4nd0: missed dsaupd is the error (because target_link_libraries wasn't done properly for some reason)
 n4nd0	just needed to update cmake, that's why the error I pasted
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmmm make worked totally fine here
 blackburn	n4nd0: cd build && rm -rf * && cmake .. && make ?
 n4nd0	yep
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you update?
 n4nd0	Update CMakeLists.txt is the last commit I have
 n4nd0	https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/commits/master
 blackburn	hmm okay travis is outdated
 blackburn	thanks
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe it needs a make clean or the like in there?
 blackburn	rm -rf * is total clean
 n4nd0	I meant in travis
 n4nd0	does it do that?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	yes it cleans whole system
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 blackburn	you may see it installs packages each time
 blackburn	I expect there is a pool of workers which load image and start build
 n4nd0	true
 n4nd0	blackburn: so mmm can we make it work in travis somehow?
 blackburn	works
 n4nd0	cool

 heiko	blackburn:  around?
 heiko	blackburn: how to use shogun from matlab?
 alexlovesdata	@heiko:
 heiko	alexlovesdata: hi
 alexlovesdata	matlab static creates a sg.mexglx or a sg.mexa64
 alexlovesdata	you copy it in some path
 heiko	I see, so I have to do this manually?
 alexlovesdata	and do in matlab sgpath= 'that path'
 alexlovesdata	addpath(sgpath)
 heiko	cool I will try that, thx
 alexlovesdata	you need to tell matlab where sg.mexa64 is
 alexlovesdata	then you cna use static interfaces which are a bit outdated
 heiko	alexlovesdata: so new shogun classes are not automatically available for these right?
 alexlovesdata	Heiko? : suggestion for interface of unittest ... I am a stupid mathematician with thick glasses
 heiko	alexlovesdata: yes, we have this new framework for it. Its yet a bit hacky but works
 alexlovesdata	ye, new shogun classes are not per default available unless the interfaces are coded as commands
 heiko	see the tests folder
 heiko	tests/unit/ ...
 alexlovesdata	one could imagine to auto-create interfaces in static interfaces
 alexlovesdata	@heiko: thx ... will look into that today later
 heiko	you create a file with a similar naming as the existing ones
 heiko	and then need to import the gtest and gmock header
 heiko	but this is all in the existing tests
 heiko	you need to manually download gtest and gmock and provide their path to configure
 alexlovesdata	i will check that when I have time :)

 heiko	blackburn: the above error is tapkee
 alexlovesdata	hi heiko. I read your email, the solution is simple
 heiko	alexlovesdata: cool :) what is it?
 alexlovesdata	you need to compile with an older C++ version which is compatible with the C++ version used to cmopile matlab libraries
 heiko	uargh
 heiko	that is ugly
 alexlovesdata	-cc=gcc-4.x -cxx=g++-4.x
 alexlovesdata	but it solves the issue
 heiko	but ok, thanks for the hint
 alexlovesdata	matlab ships its own version of libraries including some boost libraries
 alexlovesdata	and these get used when you run matlab
 heiko	I see
 heiko	btw have you ever written a matlab interface? I wonder how much work that would be
 heiko	since I want to make my stuff available from matlab
 alexlovesdata	it is not so much work
 alexlovesdata	maybe 15 minutes per command
 heiko	Is a lot of thinking involved? :)
 alexlovesdata	I know what I have to do when I look into it ...
 alexlovesdata	no ... for an IT guy it is a low-brainer
 heiko	ok, Ill look into some examples
 alexlovesdata	basically you have to define the command syntax ... and then 2 interfaces
 heiko	cool, thanks a lot
