 yalcinm	ok I do have that
 yalcinm	is this the problem?
@wiking	ok then give your virtual machine 5 gigs of ram just to be on the safe sid
@wiking	*side
 yalcinm	ok
@wiking	you've just said that your virtual machine has only 1gib
 yalcinm	yes but I can change that
@wiking	do change it to 5 gigs
 yalcinm	ok

 yalcinm	hello Madan
 yalcinm	welcome
 yalcinm	Madan: are you there?
 Madan	hello yalcinm
 Madan	yalcinm: Yeah
 yalcinm	Madan: where are you from?
 Madan	I am studying in IIIT-Hyderabad, India. Currently in my 3rd year.
 yalcinm	Madan: cool
 yalcinm	do you have shogun toolbox installed and compiled?
 yalcinm	Madan: what's your O/S
 Madan	yalcinm: Not yet. I have just cloned the shogun repo from github.
 Madan	I am working on Ubuntu.
 Madan	yalcinm: Can you provide me some link which has instructions on how to install and compile shogun toolbox? I found this one: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/installation.html
 yalcinm	Madan: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
 yalcinm	do you know python?
 Madan	Thanks.
 Madan	Yeah I know python
 yalcinm	on ubuntu terminal
 yalcinm	I need to say that I'm new with python and ubuntu
 yalcinm	which python ide do you recommend on ubuntu
 yalcinm	Madan:
 Madan	yalcinm: i don't use any ide for python
 Madan	Which OS do you use?
 yalcinm	windows 8 + VMWare + Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 yalcinm	madam
 yalcinm	Madan:
 Madan	yalcinm: Okay. So did you get it?

 yalcinm	Madan: get what?
 yalcinm	Madan: do you have facebook?
 Madan	yalcinm: Yeah I have. I think we have some misunderstandings here then.
 yalcinm	Madan: I want to ask help from you about python & ubuntu
 yalcinm	that's why I asked your facebook Madan

 Madan	yalcinm: Yeah that's what I was asking if you got how to use python on ubuntu or not
 yalcinm	Madan: on terminal, when I type python, then I have it
 yalcinm	but it is not easy to use for me
 Madan	i have very rarely used python in windows, but I think once you type python on terminal, the interface should be same as in windows.
 yalcinm	Madan: I've just compiled shogun, and when I type import modshogun, it doesn't work
 yalcinm	Madan: from modshogun import RealFeatures, RegressionLabels, GaussianKernel, Math
 yalcinm	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/python_modular_examples.html#python_modular_regression_examples
 yalcinm	Madan: ?
 Madan	yalcinm: I am also just a beginner here. I don't have much exposure to shogun tools yet. I am also seeking some help. Maybe someone who has better knowledge can help you out in it.
 yalcinm	Madan: have you ever worked with multiple kernel learning? support vector machines?
 Madan	Yeah I have worked with SVMs, not multiple kernel learning though
