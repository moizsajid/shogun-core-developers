 n4nd0	blackburn, hey!
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	I am training the lpboost classifier for the faces and non-faces training set
 n4nd0	but I am just able to train it with 500 train examples :-O
 blackburn	because of CPLEX's limitations?
 n4nd0	I am not completely sure
 n4nd0	but it is the most reasonable thing since it says this comment about
 n4nd0	The CPLEX Optimizers will solve problems up to 500 variables and 500 constraints.
 n4nd0	I don't know if it is the CPLEX solver itself or because the version I downloaded is a trial one
 blackburn	why don't u simply use some svm?
 n4nd0	do you think that a single svm can handle the problem?
 blackburn	what do you mean single?
 n4nd0	one svm
 blackburn	hmm why not?
 n4nd0	I think that the idea of using boosting for face detection was that the problem was too hard to use just one classifier
 blackburn	sure but you may use some kernel
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I can try to look on the web if there is some previous work on face detection with svm :)
 blackburn	I am not sure but you may try
 n4nd0	sure
 blackburn	is it a multiclass problem?
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn	face/not face?
 n4nd0	just two classes, face or non face
 n4nd0	exactly
 blackburn	hmm then svm should work well too
 n4nd0	I will check
 n4nd0	it seems that ir works with svms too
 n4nd0	some people have done with cascaded svms but I guess that is a similar approximation to boost
 blackburn	btw what features do you use?
 blackburn	some haar like?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I have found an article that they use something call variance based Haar-like feature
 n4nd0	I am trying to get it and look it more in depth, the abstract looks like it can work for what I want
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the size of images in pixels? :)
 blackburn	there is one simple classifier in shogun
 blackburn	class ConjugateIndex
 blackburn	could you try it on pixels? :)
 blackburn	I am just curious
 n4nd0	the training images are 19x19
 n4nd0	what do you mean to try it on pixels?
 blackburn	just 19x19 pixels value vector
 blackburn	brightness
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	do you think that have any chance to work :P?
 blackburn	yeah may be 60-70% accuracy :)
 n4nd0	I will take it a look ;-)
 n4nd0	I will first take a look to that paper ... if I manage to get hold of it!
 blackburn	which?
 n4nd0	Face Detection using Variance based Haar-Like feature and SVM
 n4nd0	by Cuong Nguyen Khac, Ju H Park, Ho-youl Jung
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	I would better suggest to try first :)
 n4nd0	with the ConjugateIndex you mean?
 blackburn	with any of classifiers
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	it is pretty easy to change
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	okay will be back later

 blackburn	n4nd0:what's up?
 n4nd0	blackburn, hi!
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have tried an svm, libsvm_oneclass with different set of parameters
 blackburn	and how it wsa?
 blackburn	was*
 n4nd0	blackburn, using pixel values directly
 n4nd0	the training error is still high so not really good
 n4nd0	but I have taken a look to this paper I told you and read about the features they used for training the svm
 n4nd0	I am going to try with those to see how they work out
 blackburn	could you try ConjugateIndex?
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	I'm curious
 n4nd0	they are pretty similar to the Haar ones I already have
 n4nd0	I tried to check it but I have not identified it in the matlab/octave static interface
 n4nd0	does it have a short name?
 blackburn	what interface do you use?
 n4nd0	I am with static matlab
 blackburn	oh when no
 blackburn	it seems you don't like easy ways, right? :)
 n4nd0	haha why?
 blackburn	well modular things for me are much more conveninet
 blackburn	convenient
 n4nd0	I must try them
 n4nd0	I don't know why I started with this one
 blackburn	well there is no matlab modular
 n4nd0	what is the main idea in the difference between both of them?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	static allows only one classifier and two features
 blackburn	with modular you can create different classifiers as objects
 blackburn	just
 blackburn	classifier = LibSVM(C,kernel,labels)
 blackburn	classifier.train()
 blackburn	predicted = classifier.apply(test_features)
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	I would actually like to start working with modular in python
 blackburn	sure, I prefer python too
 n4nd0	but I would like to re-use the matlab code I have for the haar features
 blackburn	you may save .mat
 blackburn	and load it in python
 n4nd0	I save .mat right now
 n4nd0	can they be used directly from python?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	not directly but can be loaded
 blackburn	import scipy.io
 blackburn	faces = scipy.io.loadmat(data_file)['faces']
 blackburn	example
 n4nd0	it looks good then
 n4nd0	I am going to try it right now
 blackburn	once you've loaded matrix
 blackburn	you have to create features
 blackburn	train_features = RealFeatures(some_train_features_matrix)
 blackburn	train_labels = Labels(some_train_labels)
 n4nd0	I could load it from Python
 n4nd0	nice

 n4nd0	blackburn, hey!
 blackburn	hi
 blackburn	(again)
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn, one question
 n4nd0	yeah again :)
 n4nd0	I have come across one of the examples in the web a class called
 n4nd0	PerformanceMeasure
 blackburn	yeah it is not here anymore
 n4nd0	ok ... that answers my question then :P
 blackburn	if you want to measure something
 n4nd0	so one has to use the different classes AccuracyMeasure
 blackburn	you can use AccuracyMeasure, ROCEvaluation and etc
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	ROCEvaluation and the like
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	you speak just like me
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	it seems to me in the example that PerformanceMeasure was more handy
 n4nd0	what was the problem with it?
 blackburn	could you please paste a link?
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/modular_tutorial.html
 n4nd0	PerformanceMeasures is the exact name as it stands
 blackburn	it was decomposited because of model selection mainly
 blackburn	there are some framework there you can choose measure to use
 blackburn	i.e. then you want to maximize auROC you select ROCEvaluation
 n4nd0	aha I see
 blackburn	btw you can use
 blackburn	ContingencyTableEvaluation
 blackburn	and then
 blackburn	wait a min :)
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	checking Contingency right now
 blackburn	something like
 n4nd0	looks like a useful one :)
 blackburn	evaluator = ContingencyTableEvaluation()
 blackburn	evaluator.get_error_rate()
 blackburn	ah mistake but you get it I guess
 n4nd0	;)
 blackburn	but you are right it was handy
 blackburn	I have to think about it
 n4nd0	btw
 blackburn	we have not too much users and able to change everything hah
 n4nd0	found it weird that ROCEvaluation complained when the output of the SVM was not precisely either -1 or 1
 blackburn	I guess you mixed up things
 n4nd0	while the others (AccuracyMeasure and ContingencyTableEvaluation) didn't
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	predicted is first
 blackburn	and ground truth (-1,1) is second
 n4nd0	aha! that's it
 n4nd0	stupid mistkae :P
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	should be warning here or so
 blackburn	sleep time
 blackburn	n4nd0: see you later :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, good night
 blackburn	btw did you manage to test things with modular?
 n4nd0	blackburn, and thank you for your help :D
 n4nd0	yes, I am right now with it in python
 blackburn	no problem you are a potential developer so you may help later ;)
 blackburn	okay good night
