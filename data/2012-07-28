 think_	is there anyone here?
 think_	~
 think_	I have some problems when using shogun in a research of multiclass with MKL.
 think_	I try to train the dataset(some features of a image lib) with shogun
 think_	So
 think_	I use the example code in shogun(static octave interface)  called 'multiclass.m'
 think_	But the program often terminated abruptly when training/testing, it annoyed me a lot..

 wiking	blackburn: here?
 blackburn	wiking: yeah
 wiking	blackburn: wazza with our project?
 wiking	blackburn: any steps in the HOGer? ;P
 blackburn	wiking: large scale recognition one?
 blackburn	wiking: well as I said before I can't really understand how to use hog there
 wiking	yep
 wiking	and then i've sent you the idea from that paper
 blackburn	you mean local coordinate coding thing?
 blackburn	wiking: I see on problem here
 blackburn	one*
 blackburn	that method makes data even bigger
 wiking	that shouldn't matter
 wiking	we have about 8tb free
 blackburn	wiking: well that matters cause we would need moths to train :)
 wiking	blackburn: llc is like bow
 wiking	so we can first try to do a bow
 wiking	and that should be smaller than llc
 blackburn	bow based on hog?
 wiking	yeah why not
 blackburn	wiking: how to learn a codebook?
 blackburn	I miss that point
 wiking	the same way as they do that in the paper
 wiking	afaik a clustering
 wiking	like kmeans
 blackburn	wiking: I am confused with it - what to cluster?
 wiking	the features
 blackburn	okay I am leaving now but will get back to hog this evening
 wiking	blackburn: ok

 n4nd0	blackburn, gsomix: I am sorry guys ... http://9gag.com/gag/4877928
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm I was thinking why and then I realized they are LGBT
 blackburn	actually fuck lgbt :D
 K0stIa	Hi all! I'm trying shogun for python and I can't find package tools to run examples.. can someone give me a hint where is it ?
 blackburn	K0stIa: I'd rather suggest you to install from sources - it is quite easy
 blackburn	wiking: ping
 n4nd0	blackburn: lol
 K0stIa	ok. I will try. BTW: it installs in directories with prefix /usr/local and that's why shogun can't be loaded automatically... on has to include it to pythonpath or move to something like /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 blackburn	K0stIa: you always can change the prefix
 K0stIa	yes, that's true.. but it would be nice if it were described in installation section
 blackburn	K0stIa: I am unsure I get the problem - so default prefix doesn't work for you?
 K0stIa	default prefix works fine for me, bit it's /usr/local which is not good because of aforementioned reasons
 blackburn	okay lets get back to that reason - what is wrong with /usr/local?
 blackburn	K0stIa: what is your distribution?
 K0stIa	if it's installed in /usr/local/... then "import shogun" will fail because python (at least python2.7) doesn't look for it in directories /usr/local/....
 K0stIa	I'm using python 2.7
 blackburn	no, it is not python related, it is linux distrib related
 K0stIa	hmm... ok, I will check.
 K0stIa	thanks
 blackburn	it works fine in ubuntu/debian
 blackburn	K0stIa: what is yours?
 K0stIa	arch linux
 blackburn	okay probably it can be an arch related issue
 blackburn	googling around
 K0stIa	could be.. I will look at it more carefully.
 K0stIa	blackburn: thanks for help
 blackburn	K0stIa: I didn't really manage to find whether /usr/local is in python's exec path under arch
 blackburn	but there are a few mentions of setting it manually
 K0stIa	I'm sure that in default setting it's not :)
 blackburn	that's a little strange for me
 K0stIa	and of course one can change it
-!- james_____ [~jaume@90.175.233.253] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	K0stIa: so in arch everything installs to /usr/lib/python2.7/..?
 blackburn	actually shogun is the only library I have in /usr/local/lib :D
 K0stIa	the same for me :)
 K0stIa	it installs in /usr/local/lib/python2.7...
 blackburn	K0stIa: actually it makes sense for me to install to local path
 K0stIa	why ?
 blackburn	/usr/lib is controlled by your packaging system
 blackburn	mostly
 K0stIa	it would be nice if it were possible to install it through something like easy_install
 K0stIa	I guess there is something for that.. like it automatically takes last git version and installs it...
 blackburn	well all you need to do is git clone or git pull, configure, make and make install
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 K0stIa	yes.. but in my case something more :)
 blackburn	K0stIa: currently I see no other way
 K0stIa	ok :) it's fine for me.
 K0stIa	thanks.
 K0stIa	btw: version from git failed now.... :(
 blackburn	K0stIa: we can't use anything like easy install because shogun is not a python package
 blackburn	it compiles on buildbot - what is wrong?
 K0stIa	I tried ./configure --interfaces=python_static,python_modular, make and it failed on
 K0stIa	/mnt/E/research/3dlibrary/shogun/src/shogun/features/DataGenerator.cpp:35: undefined reference to `shogun::SGMatrix<double>::get_allocated_matrix(int, int, shogun::SGMatrix<double>)'
 K0stIa	./features/DataGenerator.cpp.o: In function `shogun::CDataGenerator::generate_sym_mix_gauss(int, double, double, shogun::SGMatrix<double>)':
 K0stIa	/mnt/E/research/3dlibrary/shogun/src/shogun/features/DataGenerator.cpp:56: undefined reference to `shogun::SGMatrix<double>::get_allocated_matrix(int, int, shogun::SGMatrix<double>)'
 K0stIa	/mnt/E/research/3dlibrary/shogun/src/shogun/features/DataGenerator.cpp:75: undefined reference to `shogun::SGMatrix<double>::matrix_multiply(shogun::SGMatrix<double>, shogun::SGMatrix<double>, bool, bool, double)'
 blackburn	got it
 blackburn	K0stIa: I'll fix it in a few minutes but actually I'd suggest you to install lapack
 K0stIa	I'm using intel library for it... it's not enough ?
 blackburn	in other way you will not have some algorithms available
 blackburn	mkl?
 K0stIa	yes
 blackburn	it is, but is it detected on configure?
 K0stIa	I will check
 K0stIa	how can I check it ?
 blackburn	when you run configure it shows info about detected deps
 blackburn	just find MKL line there and check whether it is 'no' or 'yes'
 K0stIa	oh.. it didn't find it :(
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@95.153.175.78] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	probably you need to setup paths
 blackburn	K0stIa: is $MKLPATH var set on your machine?
 K0stIa	no it's not...
 blackburn	K0stIa: you need to find where mkl is installed and add it to configure paths
 K0stIa	ok..
 blackburn	actually it is not a typical case so it can't be done automatically
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r787c44a / src/shogun/lib/SGMatrix.cpp : Changed lapack guard in sgmatrix - http://git.io/1lqhLQ
 blackburn	K0stIa: anyway it should work even w/o lapack now
 K0stIa	btw: it still can't find my MKL... :(
 blackburn	K0stIa: what did you do?
 K0stIa	I created MKLPATH and MKLINCLUDE...
 K0stIa	also I tried to run  mklvars.sh from my MKL
 blackburn	no, you should specify it in configure
 K0stIa	oh,, I see...
 blackburn	--libs=$MKLPATH
 blackburn	--includes=$MKLINCLUDE
 K0stIa	I see... I thought to have it as environment variables would be enough...
 blackburn	K0stIa: your nick looks like a russian name
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	okay about mkl I think it needs to be checked in makefile
 K0stIa	is it bad ? Russians are not allowed ?
 K0stIa	ok, I'm not russian :P
 blackburn	K0stIa: no, I am
 K0stIa	nice, then we can chat in Russian ? :P
 blackburn	???????? :)
 K0stIa	?????? )
 K0stIa	?? ? ??????? ?? ????? ?????? ???? ?)
 K0stIa	:)
 blackburn	however only gsomix, you and I know russian so all others wouldn't be able to parse it
 K0stIa	ok, now problem :)
 K0stIa	*no
