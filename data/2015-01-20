 sonne|work	HeikoS: how did your exam go?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: hi, thanks for asking. did go mixed, quite hard stuff
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so a written one?
@HeikoS	yeah 6 hour set of problems
@HeikoS	scope: any nips paper
 sonne|work	HeikoS: woah! I guess that is the best preparation for any kind of job interview to have!
@HeikoS	maybe ;)
@HeikoS	definitely pushes one a lot and so I learned a lot during the process
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so what are your plans shogun wise?
 sonne|work	will you write some blog post?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	thats planned for this week in fact
@HeikoS	thursday is my blogging day now
@HeikoS	 :)
@HeikoS	have a good plan for other things too
 sonne|work	and what do we do with the release now - I haven't heard back from wiking about naming
@HeikoS	I did not get this naming issue
@HeikoS	google translate did not help
 sonne|work	and IIRC there is the GSoC application openining up soon
@HeikoS	no there is some time left
@HeikoS	I have that in my calendar already
 sonne|work	14 days?
@HeikoS	also got some mentors etc
@HeikoS	yeah something like that
@HeikoS	But I can do this within a day once its time
@HeikoS	there is also a deadline on feb5 for ICML so i try to do urgent things first
@HeikoS	we have to scale down gsoc a bit anyways
@HeikoS	I cant spend that much time this year
@HeikoS	but we will do one for sure
 sonne|work	HeikoS: excellent
@HeikoS	sonne|work: btw
@HeikoS	http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03326
@HeikoS	first first author paper :)
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I don't expect things here to calm down before end of april - but by then the house should be ready
@HeikoS	sonne|work: how are things for you?
 sonne|work	HeikoS:congratulations - where will you publish this (or did already)?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: ICML it will go to
@HeikoS	though some things still needed for that
@HeikoS	but I will submit 2 papers so currently busy with the other one
 sonne|work	HeikoS: from the title it sounds like you need to work @google :)
@HeikoS	haha indeed
 sonne|work	you have too much spare time ;)
@HeikoS	we cite a google paper quite early
 sonne|work	hehe
@HeikoS	sonne|work: when are you back to shogun?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: about the naming of the release - we really shouldn't name it 3.2.1 but 3.3.0 or 4.0.0
@HeikoS	yeah 3.3 is fine with me
@HeikoS	not 4.0
 sonne|work	0.0.1 is really bugfixes only
@HeikoS	we need to fix things first
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	I will tell wiking
@HeikoS	sonne|work: but it doesnt matter to much in my eyes
@HeikoS	we can do 4.0 when we have the first batch of cleanups
@HeikoS	but also can do this now
@HeikoS	4.0-pre
@HeikoS	or so
 sonne|work	no one expects 4.0 to be bug free
@HeikoS	ok then
@HeikoS	Ill push this to be 4.0
@HeikoS	pre
 sonne|work	normally people like to use 4.1 or 4.2
@HeikoS	ok got it
 sonne|work	or something with some more increments
 sonne|work	HeikoS: load is still high here and since I bike to work I don't work in the S-Bahn anymore
@HeikoS	hows the private project going?
 sonne|work	well we are living in the house now
 sonne|work	but it still needs some work
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	congrats on that
 sonne|work	remember that it is a chimera of 50% old (1937) and newly built one

@lisitsyn	sonne|work: HeikoS: hey there
@lisitsyn	so chiyuan knows japanese
@lisitsyn	I'll ask him to japagoogle about that guy
@lisitsyn	so we don't have stalin version
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
@HeikoS	wiking: we should do shogun 4.0
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: whats this name issue I dont get it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh not an issue
@lisitsyn	just precaution by sonne|work
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	say this guy killed 1M people
@lisitsyn	we don't want this name then :D
@HeikoS	ehm
@HeikoS	why would we choose it?
@HeikoS	at all then?
@HeikoS	what speaks *for* it?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I don't get it
@lisitsyn	what do you mean?
@HeikoS	why *would* we choose this name?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking already did
@lisitsyn	that's the first one on the lsit
@lisitsyn	list*
@HeikoS	list?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: list of shoguns!
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	okay
@HeikoS	in that sense, I think I am fine with it
 sonne|work	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_shoguns
 sonne|work	HeikoS: it might be bad taste to chose e.g. a stalin kind of person
@HeikoS	ok
 sonne|work	that is all
@HeikoS	what about just moving to next one?
 sonne|work	no we don't know
 sonne|work	that is the problem
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	so whats to discuss?
@lisitsyn	I asked chiyuan
@HeikoS	and?
@lisitsyn	I asked him to lurk around and check
@HeikoS	its fine then?
@lisitsyn	if this guy has any negative
@lisitsyn	if it is ok - we just do the nop operation
@lisitsyn	and keep it
@HeikoS	ok
@lisitsyn	else we need to select other one :)
@HeikoS	cool
