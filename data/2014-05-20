 kislay	pickle27, yo!
 pickle27	kislay: whats up?
 kislay	pickle27, http://pastebin.com/Uz2CJi3X
 kislay	pickle27, A small eg. of DenseSGMatrixFactory.
 pickle27	kislay: looks good
 pickle27	can you have a default on the dense factory too plz
 kislay	yes sure
 kislay	But we need CDenseFeatures<float64_t> a lot.
 kislay	pickle27, So, I think we must convert all of them to <float64_t>
 pickle27	kislay: actually this is a good point
 pickle27	this is something we need to think about
 pickle27	do we want to incorporate switching the type with the conversions
 pickle27	or do we always do 1 to 1 types and then you can change the shogun type after if you need
 kislay	I think we should maintain the way the Matrix was originally presented to us.
 pickle27	okay lets go with that then
 pickle27	you'll need to extend the current implementation to include getting the type from the input and choosing the appropriate type for the output
 kislay	But again, I don't know how to do it. Templates right?
 pickle27	I don't think you'll need templates
 pickle27	you can ask a cvMat what its type is
 pickle27	and then lookup what the corresponding shogun type is from a constant
 pickle27	then pass that result into the SGMatrix constructor that you are going to return
 pickle27	make sense?
 kislay	yeah.
 kislay	very appropriate it seems to me. Btw the other method you suggested is good too.
 kislay	what's your views?
 pickle27	I like simple so I agree we should return a matrix of the same type as was given to us
 pickle27	is that what you meant>
 kislay	that is right. The other method where we do 1 to 1 types..i.e always generate uint8_t but at the last moment convert it into the required type.
 pickle27	lets just go 1 to 1
 kislay	err.. the one which you explained to me. that one, right?
 pickle27	yeah!
 kislay	yup.
 pickle27	getting the type of the input and then setting the output type to match
 pickle27	you'll need a constant that maps cv types to shogun types
 kislay	yeah. It looks elegant.
 pickle27	check out std::map
 pickle27	should do the trick
 kislay	great! thanks

 kislay	hey lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	kislay: hey
@besser82	lisitsyn, ho!
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey
@besser82	lisitsyn, how is it?
@besser82	lisitsyn, any news on the data?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: sorry it was very intense
@besser82	lisitsyn, np  ;)
 kislay	I need some help in Cpp. could you look this http://pastebin.com/qj3BqLTs.
 lisitsyn	I was ill and now trying to catch up with my thesis
@besser82	lisitsyn, allrighty!  ;)
 lisitsyn	have like a few more days to get it polished
@besser82	lisitsyn, like me with results on the data :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: it would be next thing ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, don't hurry
 lisitsyn	kislay: alright - what is it?
@besser82	lisitsyn, the clustering stuff is nearly ready2go  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: cool
@besser82	lisitsyn, next would be deep sentiment stuff  =)
 kislay	lisitsyn, converting opencv matrix into SGMatrix.
 lisitsyn	kislay: yeah that's pretty clear ;) I mean the question
 kislay	lisitsyn, I am not getting how to get those mapped values into arguments of SGMatrix< > templates!!
 kislay	lisitsyn, the String I have shown there is obviously wrong. Just to print the output I did tha
 kislay	lisitsyn, what should be the  map<int, *type*>
 lisitsyn	what is this map intended for?
 kislay	to invoke the correct SGMatrix constructor... i.e according to the type of the opencv matrix.
 lisitsyn	I guess you need templated getMatrix function
 lisitsyn	like template <typename T> SGMatrix<T> getMatrix(Mat);
 lisitsyn	I see no other way as Mat has erased its type
 kislay	ah!
 kislay	lisitsyn, okay. I will hack a bit. thanks.
 lisitsyn	kislay: it would be possible if we could make SGMatrix like 'polymorphic'
 lisitsyn	but it is somewhat called value type
 lisitsyn	you just have its value and its efficient type is the same
 lisitsyn	so actually SGMatrix<int> and SGMatrix<float> are totally different classes with nothing in common
 kislay	lisitsyn, so you suggest this as viable too, right?
 lisitsyn	kislay: you'd have to put a type in any case
 lisitsyn	so it would be
 lisitsyn	getMatrix<float>(Mat)
 lisitsyn	or whatever type it is
 lisitsyn	I don't think it is possible to obtain the type of Mat's element
 lisitsyn	you can only try to convert it and check whether this conversion is ok
 kislay	lisitsyn, ok

 yorkerlin	Hi Can anyone tell whether my guess about this construct SGVector(T * v,index_t len,bool ref_counting = true) is correct or not?  My guess is the SGVector will RE-USE the memory space in v and will AUTOMATICALLY clean-up (DELETE) the memory space if we use SGVector instance instead of SGVector pointer.
 thoralf|home	yorkerlin: You should check the implementation.
 thoralf|home	yorkerlin: Tell me what you think (after reading the code) and I'll tell you if it was true.
 thoralf|home	:)
 yorkerlin	ic
 yorkerlin	I check the implementation. It seems my guess is correct.
 thoralf|home	yorkerlin: Seems it's just copying the provided pointer... and it gets freed.
 thoralf|home	yorkerlin: You know that you don't need to do "new SGVector(v, len, true)" but just "new SGVector(v, len)"?
 thoralf|home	ref_count=true is passed as default parameter
 yorkerlin	Yes
 yorkerlin	Thanks for your quick reply
