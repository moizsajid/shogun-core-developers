 thegruel	Hi! Anyone here using the python-modular interface?
* thegruel feels ignored.
 thegruel	Anyway, it'd be great if somebody fixed python-modular. Thanks guys!
 gsomix	thegruel, hey
 gsomix	what's wrong with python_modular?
 thegruel	Hi gsomix.
 thegruel	It can't create Features.Labels objects anymore, which break nearly all tests (see  http://bit.ly/eQDk8Q  )
 thegruel	build #156 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/156  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 thegruel	No, wait, that log had yet another problem.
 thegruel	Mine was simply "TypeError: Cannot create new instances of type 'Labels',
 gsomix	thegruel, check, please, that you use latest git version of shogun.
 gsomix	hm, strange error
 gsomix	thegruel, btw, Labels now is abstract class. which code/example fails?
-!- zxtx [~zv@ool-457e7550.dyn.optonline.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	thegruel, you have to use BinaryLabels, MulticlassLabels, RegressionLabels etc
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey there
@sonney2k	any idea what is going on on the bb?
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw which swig version do you have?
@sonney2k	rieck, yes alive just now
@sonney2k	but can change any minute ...
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@202.130.113.141] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 gsomix	sonney2k, 2.0.4
@sonney2k	gsomix, bb and here 2.0.7

-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-176-3-219.range86-176.btcentralplus.com] has left #shogun []
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, but what about fail in examples?
@sonney2k	gsomix, what happens w/ 2.0.7?
 gsomix	sonney2k, segfault in compilation
@sonney2k	gsomix, compiling swig segfaults?
 gsomix	sonney2k, compiling shogun modulars
@sonney2k	gsomix, works just fine here - which gcc version?
 gsomix	sonney2k, 4.6.3
@sonney2k	hmmhh 4.7.1 here
 gsomix	oh, I'm slowpoke :)
 gsomix	need to update all software
@sonney2k	gsomix, or alternatively compile it with clang++
@sonney2k	gsomix, package clang is needed for that...
 gsomix	anyway fail in buffer protocol example is not related to swig.
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, I'll try.
@sonney2k	gsomix, which python version do you have?
 gsomix	2.7.3
@sonney2k	me too
@sonney2k	gsomix, buildbot has 2.6.6.
@sonney2k	so it might be due to that
@sonney2k	it compiles/runs just fine here
 gsomix	what about numpy?
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw this examples works on your machine?
 gsomix	*example
@sonney2k	I have 1.6.4
@sonney2k	1.6.2
@sonney2k	sry
@sonney2k	and bb has 1.4.1
 gsomix	hm
@sonney2k	gsomix, you think it is too old?
@sonney2k	maybe numpy didn't support buffer proto stuff yet
 gsomix	yep
 gsomix	because just fails on PyObject_CheckBuffer(o2);
@sonney2k	gsomix, that is not easily installed - could you add some check for numpy 1.5 i.e. numpy.__version__ >= '1.5'
 gsomix	sonney2k, what do to if numpy version <= 1.5?
 gsomix	awww, ok
 gsomix	sorry, got it
@sonney2k	when <1.5 print some warning that this example requires numpy 1.5 or later
@sonney2k	gsomix, in the example only I meant
 gsomix	I see
 gsomix	sonney2k, I also discuss with blackburn about slicing.
 gsomix	I think, that DenseFeatures[a:b] should return numpy.array
 gsomix	because it's easy way
@sonney2k	gsomix, can one then do DenseFeatures[a:b] = numpy.arange(a,b) ?
 gsomix	I think - yes
@sonney2k	then yes :)
@sonney2k	would just be good to be able to modify elements via slicing too
 gsomix	aha

@sonney2k	hey bern4rd
* thegruel is back. Thanks for the clarifications. 
 bern4rd	hey
@sonney2k	bern4rd, have you seen the repo is now  at shogun-toolbox?
 bern4rd	Fernando told me about the new repository
@sonney2k	bern4rd, could you access it?
 bern4rd	yes, I have clone it right now
@sonney2k	I gave you r/w access but you never know
 bern4rd	I'm going to check, I am a beginner with git
@sonney2k	bern4rd, well just clone and push some minor change
@sonney2k	bern4rd, btw what is the admin password?
 bern4rd	yes I have r/w access
@sonney2k	if I want to modify the style etc?
 bern4rd	login:root, pass:toor
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	I will then try to change a bit style wise - any idea what to do against conflicts when we both modify the sqlite db?
 bern4rd	no :(

@sonney2k	so if I keep change windows small then it can work just fine
@sonney2k	bern4rd, and btw thanks for again for your work!
* sonney2k afg
 bern4rd	ok, I am going to explain better all the things in the readme.
* sonney2k afk
 bern4rd	you'r welcome =)

 heiko	blackburn, sonney2k, I fixed the x-val kernel-multi-class error, it was a problem in store_model_features of CKernelMulticlassMachine

 CIA-18	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * rdb4985d / (3 files in 2 dirs): Merge pull request #653 from karlnapf/master - http://git.io/DUVqSQ
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, Id like to push a thing: We need more tests (for new code) and code should be documented better
 heiko	It happens so often (as just now) that somebody spends hours in finding a bug that could *easily* be detected by a test
 heiko	so I think it should be compulsory for everybody to write a (small) test for every new (complex) method that is added
 heiko	This would save time at the end of the day, also, we would be able to spot problems far more accurate
 heiko	the current multiclass - cross-validation problem did not even fail a test. It just gave wrong results ( SV and non-SV permuted)
 heiko	In my eyes, we shouldnt accept pull-requests without tests for new stuff anymore
 heiko	it was just by chance that somebody found this problem with the multiclass CV. This damages SHOGUN's reputation
 heiko	and one more thing: Debugging often is very very hard since the code is badly or not even at all commented
 heiko	We should insist on comments in the code for every non-trivial thing that is going on
 heiko	this would save much time while debugging
 heiko	I think if we continue changing things at the current pace we will run into problems if we dont do these two things (tests & better in-code-documentation)

 blackburn	heiko: we need some approach for that
 heiko	blackburn, yes, I think so
 heiko	otherwise we cannot controll things anymore at some point, and it gets harder and harder for new poeple to get into SHOGUN
 blackburn	other way is to freeze these kind of features
 heiko	I would just make it madatory to write tests
 heiko	if you fiddle around with indices, just write a test to make sure things are working that automatically checks things
 heiko	etc
 blackburn	what is test?
 blackburn	how it works?
 heiko	like a unit test or so
 heiko	or a libshogun example
 heiko	it should assert correct expected results
 heiko	otherwise fail and teil you which method doesnt work
 blackburn	no libshogun example is wrong way I am afraid
 blackburn	problem is that is good for example could be bad for test
 blackburn	and vice versa
 blackburn	but we don't separate it still
 heiko	yeah

 heiko	you are right
-!- Netsplit over, joins: wiking
 heiko	we should separate things
 heiko	I write all tests to libshogun examples
 heiko	but thats not good for illustration
 heiko	I mean there are tools that give you code coverage etc
 heiko	It slows down development
 heiko	but greatly increases stability
 heiko	since people have to think about code more

 heiko	thats not be shogun-buildbot !
 blackburn	heiko: calm down it is gsomix the cause
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	not really angry ;)
 heiko	blackburn, what do you think of this:
 heiko	http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Samples
 blackburn	is it GNU?
 blackburn	GPL I mean
 blackburn	aham bsd
 blackburn	i bet sonney2k would not like it
 blackburn	and say something 'ah yet another one dependency I'LL KILL YOU' :D
 heiko	lol :)
 heiko	I also would love to use BOOST :)
 blackburn	for what?
 heiko	has for example all statistical distribution functions and cdfs
 heiko	its a pain to import these from e.g. ALGLIB
 blackburn	these ones you integrated?
 blackburn	lol
 heiko	and in boost these are already in, tested documented etc
 blackburn	boost is huge dependency though
 heiko	yes I know
 heiko	shogun isnt small either :D
 heiko	anyway, the tests are more important I think
 blackburn	bad thing about boost and templates in general
 blackburn	is really awful compilation speed and errors parseability
 wiking	heiko: blackburn bsd license should not be a problem at all
 wiking	heiko: second for the unit testing

 gsomix	shogun-buildbot, okay, okay. :( I'll fix it, I promise.
@sonney2k	wiking, where is your weekly report?
@sonney2k	heiko, so if you have time to discuss lets do it.
@sonney2k	rieck, ping ping ping
@sonney2k	gsomix, did you fix the example?
@sonney2k	gsomix, I didn't see your PR...
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh and does clang++ work for you?
 gsomix	sonney2k, little later, working on slicing now.
@sonney2k	gsomix, please fix the example first... fixing broken builds unfortunately always have priority
@sonney2k	has
 heiko	blackburn, I participated in kaggle hh during a course in uni here, we were among the 500 first places :)
 heiko	sonney2k, I have to leave soon sorry, but lets discuss tomorrow
 blackburn	heiko: do you think together we can do that better?
 heiko	I really would like to push that
 heiko	blackburn, I used shogun actually :)
 blackburn	yeah that is my point to
 blackburn	too*
 blackburn	to enhance shogun through usage
 heiko	blackburn, my group was kind of good, but liblinear didnt support regression back then, would have helped a lot
 heiko	I currently dont have time for that, but perhaps at the end of the year
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, sorry
 heiko	gotta go now, see you later today or tomorrow!
 blackburn	yeah after gsoc would be cool
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't have time for that unfortunately... but I talked to some guys at NIPS last year and they also said I (with them) should do this ;-)

@sonney2k	audy, the destiny of all phds :)
 audy	blackburn my boss. I'm a PhD student
 blackburn	ah I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, well if we could fund ourselves via winning all kaggle's and developing shogun at the same time - why not :D
 audy	the shogun kaggle team?
 blackburn	yeah
 audy	there's a $3 mil prize on there currently
