 n4nd0	hi there
 n4nd0	is there any nice function already implemented in shogun to concatenate matrices in C++?
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	one should rather try to avoid this for large feature matrices...
 sonne|work	i.e. for computing cov you should rather add a new cov function that operates on two matrices :)
 n4nd0	ok, I see
 n4nd0	I will first implement it in the class MahalanobisDistance and if it is better later I can move to another where it is more appropriate

 sonne|work	n4nd0: it would make sense to just put it next to the get_cov from dotfeatures :)

 blackburn	sonne|work: hey, howdy?
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you need any other suggestions what to work on? ;)
 sonne|work	howdy cowboy ;-)(
 blackburn	sonne|work: will you store current proposal at shogun-publicity?
 sonne|work	when I made some more progress yes
 blackburn	is it raw still?
 sonne|work	btw, we have some new great ideas from vojtech :)
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	great ideas from vojtech? I am curious
 blackburn	so what are the ideas?
 sonne|work	I will commit this in the evening
 blackburn	will he be able to mentor 2 students?
 blackburn	sonne|work: sagen sie mal ideas!
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	yes I know it is not a proper deutsch ;)
 sonne|work	well we don't know if we get good proposals for all ideas...
 blackburn	sonne|work: away     : ? db & Biotek - SOD ? -- hey now I know what is the music you are listening to! :D
 blackburn	tell me the ideas!
 blackburn	damn once upon a time I will get your phone number and will call you to make you answer ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure! tell me
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am a bit stuck with some university work but I hope I will be back soon to fix the Mahalanobis stuff and after I can take a look to another thing
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd have to think about it though :)
 blackburn	same thing here with work and university
 n4nd0	blackburn: ah ok! I thought you already came up with something, I took a quick look yesterday to GPs in scikit-learn
 blackburn	not really but I had some ideas before and 'll try to remind it during the spare time
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	what do you study in the university btw?
 blackburn	well some shit I do not really like to study hah
 blackburn	officially I have major in mathematics and computer science
 blackburn	hard to translate these parts of russian education to your standarts :)
 blackburn	but I guess I can say it is major
 n4nd0	haha I know what you mean with standards
 n4nd0	my Spanish studies are not really within any normal standards either ...
 blackburn	if you have talked to some russians you probably know we can't choose what to study :)
 n4nd0	oh really?
 n4nd0	didn't know about that! I have met some Russians around here but never heard it
 n4nd0	that doesn't sound good
 blackburn	so I just have to study what they say to study :)
 blackburn	currently it is some optics (again) and DSP
 blackburn	and also some software engineering stuff
 n4nd0	I am taking right now a course from Spain in software engineering too
 n4nd0	personally I don't like it that much, too theoretical from my point of view
 blackburn	my SE course here is a useless crap
 blackburn	I have never seen such stuff they treat as software engineering 'ways' anywhere :)
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	n4nd0: funny thing I have no machine learning courses here as well
 blackburn	and I did some unofficial course by myself last year :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: it's not nice that they don't have ml courses
 blackburn	https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/ml/classification-NB%2CID3.pdf
 n4nd0	did you take those courses in the university or somewhere else?
 blackburn	I bet you won't understand much ;)
 blackburn	in russian hah
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	well I just asked my fellows if they want to study it a little
 n4nd0	the link doesn't wotk either
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	and did 5 lectures on some basic ML
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/ml/classification-NB%2CID3.pdf
 blackburn	hm sorry yes
 blackburn	right one ^
 n4nd0	I like slides with latex :)
 blackburn	everyone do :)
 n4nd0	I got to know ml last year when I came to Stockholm
 n4nd0	never saw something similar before in my courses in Spain
 n4nd0	well maybe something similar to classification with detectors in digital communications
 blackburn	hardest thing here was to fit python classifiers in one slide :D
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	yeah ML is not known everywhere yet
 n4nd0	but the funniest thing is that some people in my home university makes some reasearch on svms
 n4nd0	so it is like ... wtf you should let us know about that stuff!
 blackburn	haha yeah
 n4nd0	anyway
 blackburn	people here in my one do not know svms at all
 n4nd0	they have some pretty cool courses at KTH on machine learning
 n4nd0	there is a machine learning master actually
 blackburn	they prefer to do something like 'solving neyman-pearson task with fisher discriminant analysis'
 blackburn	in other words to do stuff everyone did in 1960s
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	yeah, I know what you mean
 blackburn	they think they can really control probabilities with these outdated stuff :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: there is a soviet legacy everywhere
 blackburn	we call it 'sowok' :)
 n4nd0	does it stand for sth?
 blackburn	soviet union = sowetskiy soyuz -> sowok
 n4nd0	haha ok
 blackburn	this word also stands for scoop for dust :)
 blackburn	oh it seems I don't want to work at all
 n4nd0	haha nice coincidence the one for the dust
 n4nd0	same here, I am scared of a problem I have to hand in :S
 blackburn	lets check whether my manager could notice I have nothing to work on
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the problem?
 n4nd0	blackburn: wireless communications stuff
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	I actually enjoy the contents of the course, they are interesting
 wiking	blackburn: the whole pdf is in russian! :)
 wiking	do something about it :)
 blackburn	wiking: well I have presented it to russian audience ;)
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	actually my english is pretty bad, but others have even worse
 blackburn	so it would be way too funny
 n4nd0	c'mon, you write quite well around here, your English cannot be bad!
 wiking	blackburn: you've gotta practice mate :)
 wiking	ah fuck yeah i should resend the email to alex
 wiking	what's sonney2k 's email?
 wiking	sonne@debian.org uses this?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	cool
 wiking	ok done \o/
 wiking	bbl
 blackburn	nice, I hope he will answer this time

 n4nd0	it looks like I finally convinced a friend of mine to use shogun to help with the work on his thesis :)

 n4nd0	bais: hey!
 bais	i was considering to use shogun to test my own implementation of a string kernel.
 bais	would it be particularly hard to plug in my own kernel function in a SVM using shogun?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 n4nd0	bais: I am not completely sure about it, I guess it depends on the complexity of your kernel
 n4nd0	but it shouldn't be a big deal at first sight
 n4nd0	take a look at this one, it is particularly short
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/FixedDegreeStringKernel_8cpp_source.html
 n4nd0	but I guess it would be more interesting if you could use your own implementation in python/octave so you can try it faster
 n4nd0	but I don't know if that can be done without implementing it in C++ :(
 bais	oh i see.. my intention was exactly to use an octave implementation, so speed up the development and test the results without having too much trouble in the coding process
 bais	at first at least..
* n4nd0 
* bais thanks n4nd0 for his help, and thinks n4nd0 is a valid member of the shogun community
 n4nd0	bais: haha I have just been around here for a couple of weeks
 n4nd0	member sounds more important than that :P
 bais	i will continue reading some documentation and come back in case i have other problems / questions!
 bais	tnx bye!

 n4nd0	sonne|work: for the covariance stuff, in order to decide whether rhs and lhs are equal, is it enough with lhs != rhs
 n4nd0	sonne|work: or should I loop and compare element by element?
 n4nd0	sounds like sort of stupid question :(
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
