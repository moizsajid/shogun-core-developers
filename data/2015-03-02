@lisitsyn	cool
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: where is our ideas page now?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: github wiki
@lisitsyn	ehmm
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: it looks like we had wrong url for ideas in the application
@lisitsyn	:-O
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: then we are out :(
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: description has proper url
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I guess we will know in ~9 hrs :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: would it make sense to notify carol we had a wrong url?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well worth a try - it might be too late though...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: can you write a mail?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: so that is the correct url right https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015-projects

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: !
@lisitsyn	we are quite careless apparently :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we had wrong link for ideas
@lisitsyn	in the application
@HeikoS	what?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the one in description was correct
@HeikoS	I know it was wrong on the first trial, but I though I corrected it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I fixed it and fernando wrote a mail to carol
@HeikoS	phew :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am not sure if it can help though
@lisitsyn	may be too late
@HeikoS	Well its copy paste, they should not be too strict
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ohh they can be pretty strict
@lisitsyn	there are like hundred and more of orgs
@HeikoS	we have it on our website
@HeikoS	should not be a problem
@lisitsyn	lets hope so
@HeikoS	but good that you realised
@lisitsyn	I hope if it had a harm we can fix it by notifying carol before
@HeikoS	it will be alright
@HeikoS	they look at the whole application, not just one link
@lisitsyn	you're quite optimistic guy aren't you? :)
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but it would be ridiculous to reject because of this link being wrong
@HeikoS	I trust them to do proper screening of the ords
@HeikoS	including having a look at the website
@HeikoS	and this is why it was important to put it on the front page
@HeikoS	but we have, so its easy to find the ideas page
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: great idea with the namespaces
@HeikoS	ok time for science, I will be back later
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: when will be notified?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: 19 utc
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	see you then :)
@HeikoS	we can have a stammtisch afterwards
@HeikoS	Ill send an email to the list
@lisitsyn	ok
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: HeikoS is always optimistic :)
 sonne|work	the total contrary to me :)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: right marvin?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: haha :)

@lisitsyn	told you
 naywhayare	we've been rejected this year
 naywhayare	(we being mlpack, not shogun)
 naywhayare	did you guys get in?
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: wow you too?
 naywhayare	you got rejected also?
@lisitsyn	yes
 naywhayare	haha
 naywhayare	they must think machine learning isn't important
 naywhayare	it's not useful to anyone, obviously
@lisitsyn	no more machine learning
 naywhayare	:)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: where is the email?
@lisitsyn	well we fscked up our ideas page
 naywhayare	that seems odd though, that they would reject you after, what, 8 years of participation?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I received
@HeikoS	:(
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: would be 5th year I think
 naywhayare	:(
 naywhayare	well, that's how it goes I guess
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well, lets make sure to check their irc meeting
@HeikoS	pitty
 naywhayare	did you know of any other ML libraries that applied?
@lisitsyn	ok lets do shogun by ourselves haha
 naywhayare	I didn't know of any others... I would be surprised to hear of no machine learning libraries in GSoC 2015
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, you know that iglesiasg and me though about skipping this year, since we have too many things to do and these gsoc projects on new algos kind of distract us gfrom doing that
@HeikoS	naywhayare: pitty for you too
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah that's ok
@lisitsyn	combo breaker though
 naywhayare	man, and these guys get in:
 naywhayare	https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/hpccsystems
@HeikoS	naywhayare: its the application that counts, not the topic of the project
-!- smallgraph [~textual@p4FDCCD96.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	naywhayare: did you do anything different to last years?
 naywhayare	no, we submitted a quite similar application
 naywhayare	the answers to the questions were similar
@HeikoS	naywhayare: also I guess, its fair to share the google love
@HeikoS	naywhayare: same here
 naywhayare	if anything the application was better since we have more mentors now
@lisitsyn	no scikit learn
@lisitsyn	hah
@iglesiasg	I am not sure whether it was the error in the url, or simply they are changing orgs
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no mlpack no shogun and no scikit learn
@lisitsyn	:D
 naywhayare	ah well, I guess we all have a bit more free time this summer :)
@iglesiasg	indeed haha
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah the error in the url cant be the reason
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: maybe a sum of things and this was one
@HeikoS	but lets see

@HeikoS	when is the meeting?
 naywhayare	I would imagine that they are just giving new organizations a chance
 naywhayare	I guess we'll find out on Friday
@lisitsyn	yeah that's pretty fair
@lisitsyn	we've been on gsoc steroids pretty long
 naywhayare	yeah, GSoC is really wonderful for bringing people into the project
@HeikoS	release into the wild ;)
 naywhayare	:)
@lisitsyn	ok lets break shogun and rebuild from scratch
@lisitsyn	now we can do any changes
@iglesiasg	naywhayare: I agree with you, I think it is new orgs coming in mostly
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha :)
-!- rajul [~rajul@node-4ap.pool-101-108.dynamic.totbb.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we have like a ton of issues to resolve
@HeikoS	well half of our projects are things we want to do
@HeikoS	I agree
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe we can choose one project and do joint forces on it
@HeikoS	with the usual weekly progress, etc
@HeikoS	to have some routine?
@iglesiasg	yes
@lisitsyn	not sure about that
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: what do you think?
@lisitsyn	lets just fix that
@iglesiasg	I think it is time we get back to black :-)
@HeikoS	ah man I forgot how to code myself over these years ;)
 naywhayare	ah, someone's just told me they accepted only 137 organizations this year as opposed to 190 last year
 smallgraph	"I agree with you, I think it is new orgs coming in mostly" why wouldn't you than give "old" orgs than at least 1-2 slots?
 naywhayare	so maybe their funding has been cut a bit...
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: god^W google knows
@iglesiasg	haha
@iglesiasg	smallgraph: yeah, that's also a good point
 smallgraph	so we can google it?
@iglesiasg	anyway, there are also good old orgs like OpenCV and Boost
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: just kidding ;)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: lisitsyn : we can always mail them and ask them for feedback
@HeikoS	yeah lets go to the irc meeting
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: doesn't matter that much for me ;)
@HeikoS	gotta run off, will be back a bit later

@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: between gsocs I mean sorry

 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: I tell you - it was the wrong url :(
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: yeah probably it was one of the reasons
 sonne|osx	well we can ask them and find out!
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: yeah sure
@lisitsyn	there will be a meeting
 sonne|osx	but seriously - they receive way too many applications so if one screws up w/ one point one is out
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: although it doesn't matter that much
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: well it does - that is how we got in - by fixing the issues
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: lets just work on shogun ;)
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: when we first applied we had the issue that we didn't include difficulties
 freedon	DId shogun get accepted as a mentoring organistaion this year ?
 sonne|osx	and didn't mention mentors
 sonne|osx	freedon: nope not this year
 sonne|osx	freedon: looks like we had a wrong link to the ideas page :(
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: but true! maybe one year w/o summer pressure really doing the things we want ourselves helps to calm down and refocus
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: after all there is lot of refactoring planned and that doesn't distribute too well
 freedon	So, anyone here who wishes to still contribute during the summers ?
 freedon	Because, I am completely free during the summers and got nothing to do

 Yorkerlin	I just am asking whether u guys still provide mentoring
@wiking	Yorkerlin: yep
@wiking	that was never about the money :)
@lisitsyn	Yorkerlin: I think we can manage that
@wiking	i mean mentoring
@lisitsyn	Yorkerlin: what project?
 Yorkerlin	Yes I know :)
 Yorkerlin	Indeed I am working with Heiko for the large scale GP project
@lisitsyn	Yorkerlin: I am sure heiko would be happy :)
 Yorkerlin	Yes. Still have a lot of clean-up for the GP module
@wiking	lisitsyn: so i'm thinking maybe this would be the bes tthing to use for the distributed stuff
@lisitsyn	wiking: but that's pretty immature..
@wiking	which?
@wiking	the c++ lib?
@wiking	i've just played with it
@wiking	and it's pretty advanced

@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah but very new
@lisitsyn	that's what I fear ;)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	well u have to start somewhere :)
@wiking	i mean we dont have reflection in c++
@wiking	so having an rdd will be quite complicated :D
-!- Yorkerlin [b8af2f1e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.184.175.47.30] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@wiking	but i have a feeling that it'd be the best option to use an actor fw + mesos for shoguns distributed backend
@lisitsyn	wiking: okay what about adding some intermediate layer to make it library agnostic?
@wiking	like?
@lisitsyn	I mean actors but with libraries isolated to some very base classes
@wiking	ah
@wiking	yeah of course
@lisitsyn	I like actor model but I am afraid of concrete libraries
@wiking	i dont think it should be solved only on shogun level
@lisitsyn	wiking: do you have any vision how this works?
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	magicooooo
@wiking	no i mean i was thinking more and more
@wiking	and trying to sketch up stuff locally
@wiking	my main problem with the current way
@wiking	is the duality
@lisitsyn	wiking: say we want to train svm
@wiking	of local distribution
@wiking	and real distribution
@wiking	i.e process vs threads
@wiking	i.e. openmp vs anything else over tcp/ip stack
@wiking	mmm well svm is a hard task
@wiking	i mean not a good choice for doing distributed work
@wiking	as it's iterative
@lisitsyn	yeah but that's the main thing to distribute
@lisitsyn	neural nets and svm
@wiking	so not too mcuh you can distribute there
@wiking	although i read a paper once somebody doing M/R svm
@lisitsyn	well SGD
@lisitsyn	some day it will converge
@lisitsyn	;)

@lisitsyn	wiking: you have some time to move some classes?
@wiking	:D
@wiking	smallgraph: ping
@lisitsyn	I am thinking about nested namespaces
@lisitsyn	good time TO BREAK THINGS
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	true
 smallgraph	Hi
@wiking	smallgraph: u /msg-ed me
@wiking	about windows
@wiking	what was that about
@wiking	?
@lisitsyn	wiking: you're on mac now?
@wiking	lisitsyn: yep
@lisitsyn	lets hack brew
@lisitsyn	haha
-!- sanuj [0e8bc402@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.139.196.2] has joined #shogun
@wiking	hahah fuck brew
@wiking	i relaly hate it
@lisitsyn	macports?
@wiking	yeah i did that once
@wiking	macports people are crazy
@wiking	i send in patches for the Portfile
@lisitsyn	alternatives?
@wiking	never apply it
 smallgraph	which MS VS are you using?
@wiking	smallgraph: none.... last time i wanted to compile shogun with visual studio it was win7
@wiking	+ visual studio 2014
@wiking	+ visual studio 2013
@wiking	bascially i've added some minor things
@wiking	but then the whole thing breaks
@wiking	when the compiler sees CMath.h
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: well we can start doing the nested part
@wiking	wanna devide up the directories among the 2 of us
@wiking	?
@lisitsyn	wiking: sure
@wiking	and push in now fast the code
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/src/shogun
@lisitsyn	wiking: odds are for you
@lisitsyn	even are for me
@lisitsyn	;)
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	start with 0?
@lisitsyn	wiking: okay
@wiking	ok so 0 is even :P
@wiking	as we know....
@lisitsyn	wiking: what about pushing per directory?
@wiking	yeah sounds good
@wiking	btw
@lisitsyn	wiking: lets setup a branch
@wiking	feature?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	feature breanch it
@wiking	*branch
@lisitsyn	refactor branch!
@wiking	ehhehe
@wiking	good
@wiking	btw do we care about correct identing?
@wiking	indenting...
@lisitsyn	hmm
@wiking	or same like shogun namespace?
@lisitsyn	lets make it flat
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so
@wiking	namespace shogun
@wiking	{
@lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	namespace feature
@wiking	{
@wiking	?
@lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	ok
@lisitsyn	wiking: I think we gonna break some swig stuff first
@wiking	of course
@wiking	but that's ok
@lisitsyn	wiking: let me dive into crazy compile-fix loop
@lisitsyn	:D
-!- SunilMahendrakar [~AndChat36@101.221.128.8] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	so push the branch
@lisitsyn	wiking: hmm it is empty
@lisitsyn	won't appear I guess
@wiking	fucking hdfs
@wiking	it's the worst thing ever written
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah kind of hard thing to maintain
@lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	argh it's super slow
@wiking	sometimes i wanna kill jvm
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh refactoring base is a bad luck
-!- sanuj [0e8bc402@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.139.196.2] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
@lisitsyn	I think I am going to change all the shogun code now
@lisitsyn	as sgobject is here
@wiking	hehhe we'll be like perl
@wiking	6.0 will be the utopia version
@wiking	for the last 20 years :D
@wiking	sgobject is a fucking crazy stuff
@wiking	and yeah we should most def take the code to non c++11 ready
@lisitsyn	wiking: what do you mean non c++11 ready?

@wiking	imagine this: i ran the spark job in 12 minutes... and the IO to write the data to hdfs takes about 50 minutes
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: btw did you check - is there any machine learning organization that got accepted
 sonne|osx	?
@wiking	...
-!- smallgraph [~textual@p4FDCCD96.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit [Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz...]
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: some small
@lisitsyn	and opencv
@wiking	lisitsyn: ah yeah so i meant: only c++11 only
@lisitsyn	wiking: ah ok
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: well opencv sure - but it is not really ML
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: barely
@wiking	lisitsyn: it's a pain in the ass to maintain code that supports both... c++11 and older
@wiking	so why not just have this
@wiking	from version 5.0.0 only c++11
@wiking	and that's all
@wiking	most of compilers support it anyways
@lisitsyn	wiking: yes sure
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: I don't see any real machine learning thing in there...
@wiking	or we just rewrite shogun in rust :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh no I like C++
@lisitsyn	it is much better than rust ;)
@wiking	hahahaha
@wiking	yeah it was just the 'yet another buzzword session'
@wiking	scala man...
@wiking	i would kill who designed scala
@lisitsyn	C++ is better than scala ;)
@lisitsyn	though they have something in common
@wiking	come one they broke the whole java obj concept
@wiking	lisitsyn: kotlin :D
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn, wiking really no ML toolbox this year not a single one...
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: well
@wiking	sonne|osx: maybe tomoorrow google will release its ML library
@lisitsyn	sonne|osx: haha
@lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	that will make everything obsolete
@wiking	:D
@wiking	i mean they had a reason
 sonne|osx	wiking: they stopped using ML?
@wiking	for sure not a financial one... as google is swimming in money more than ever
 sonne|osx	hardly :)
@wiking	so i guess we'll never know
@lisitsyn	all major ml things are going well w/o gsoc already
@lisitsyn	may be that's the reason
@wiking	which ones?
@lisitsyn	vowpal wabbit
@lisitsyn	sklearn
@wiking	ah
@wiking	sklearn
@wiking	ahahhaa
@wiking	that library is a joke :D
@lisitsyn	very widely used
@wiking	i mean i like it and i use it
@wiking	but come on
@wiking	u cant run that on serious data
@wiking	it's python for god sakes :)
 sonne|osx	too small scale for me...
@wiking	but yeah every wannabe machine learning person uses that now
@wiking	as it's easy to use
@wiking	i saw somebody tackling a problem
@lisitsyn	ah and there is no machine learning anymore
@wiking	'ml expert'
@lisitsyn	just deep learning
 sonne|osx	depp learning as the german would say ;)
@wiking	took sklearn and basically ran all the possible algos on the problem
@wiking	and did a grid search over it
@wiking	= problem solved :D
@wiking	this is new age ML ;)
@lisitsyn	wiking: no it was previous epoch
@lisitsyn	now you do something else
@wiking	aws + grid search for all
@lisitsyn	i.e.
@wiking	:)
@lisitsyn	take the biggest network you can store in memory
@lisitsyn	randomize it randomize it learn it
@lisitsyn	magic

 joergkurt	hoi, has anyone compiled shogun with an alternate SWIG directory?
@wiking	what is an alternative swig directory?
 joergkurt	aka, I dont have a preinstalled package, but have to use a local SWIG compilation
@wiking	ah
 joergkurt	like/local/depdencency/swig
@wiking	that should be fine if u have it path
@wiking	if not then you'll have to tell cmake where it can find and how swig...
 joergkurt	which env variables or cmake flags do I ahve to set for shogun?
 joergkurt	I managed a local static SWIG install, and eigen and json could be bundled, if I figure the swig I am there
@wiking	SWIG_EXECUTABLE = path to the swig exec
@wiking	-DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=/custom/path/to/swig
 joergkurt	on it, thanks
