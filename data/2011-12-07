 k_matsuda	hi, i considering modshogun ruby bindings to perform MKL.
 k_matsuda	but i have a problem about ruby binding
 k_matsuda	i initialiized Modshogun::CombinedKernel.new()
 k_matsuda	and combined_kernel.append_kernel(individual_kernel)
 k_matsuda	to perform lerning, Modshogun::MKLClassification.new(); mklsvm.set_kernel(combined_kernel)
 k_matsuda	and set labels by mklsvm.set_labels(Modshogun::Labels.new([1,-1]))
 k_matsuda	i expect MKLClassification#get_kernel will return CombinedKernel object

 k_matsuda	sorry, my network is bad...
 k_matsuda	i initialiized Modshogun::CombinedKernel.new() and combined_kernel.append_kernel(individual_kernel)
 k_matsuda	to perform lerning, Modshogun::MKLClassification.new(); mklsvm.set_kernel(combined_kernel)
 k_matsuda	and set labels by mklsvm.set_labels(Modshogun::Labels.new([1,-1]))
 k_matsuda	i expect MKLClassification#get_kernel will return CombinedKernel object but it return Kernel object.
 k_matsuda	so, i cannot get weight of individual kernels by CombinedKernel#get_subkernel_weights method.
 k_matsuda	i try like http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/687
 k_matsuda	but, kernel.get_first_kernel() is not work.
 k_matsuda	because get_kernel method return Kernel object (not CombinedKernel)
 k_matsuda	So, what to do get weight of individual kernels?
 k_matsuda	I use shogun git-head (installed yesterday) and use ruby-1.9.2

 sonne|work	k_matsuda: I understand the problem
 sonne|work	you currently can only work around this by saving the combined kernel object
 sonne|work	problem is simply that swig has no notion of casting objects
 sonne|work	k_matsuda: actually you can use combined_kernel.KernelToCombinedKernel(generic_kernel_obj)
 sonne|work	we added that very recently...
 k_matsuda	thanks for your advice!
 k_matsuda	i'did like this:
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   # cast learned Kernel obj to CombinedKernel
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   casted_kernel = combined_kernel.KernelToCombinedKernel(mklsvm.get_kernel)
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   w = []
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   individual_kernel = casted_kernel.get_first_kernel()
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   while individual_kernel
-k_matsuda:#shogun-     w << individual_kernel.get_combined_kernel_weight()
-k_matsuda:#shogun-     individual_kernel = casted_kernel.get_next_kernel()
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   end
-k_matsuda:#shogun-   p w
 k_matsuda	it seems work well...
 sonne|work	k_matsuda: I think there is even a get_subkernel_weights() function so you don't need the loop
 k_matsuda	what is as argument for get_subkernel_weights() ?
 k_matsuda	i tryed that :
-k_matsuda:#shogun- casted_kernel.get_subkernel_weights(casted_kernel.get_num_subkernels)
 k_matsuda	but i get :
-k_matsuda:#shogun- Wrong arguments for overloaded method 'CombinedKernel.get_subkernel_weights'. (ArgumentError)
-k_matsuda:#shogun- Possible C/C++ prototypes are:
-k_matsuda:#shogun-     void CombinedKernel.get_subkernel_weights(int32_t &num_weights)
-k_matsuda:#shogun-     void CombinedKernel.get_subkernel_weights(float64_t **weights, int32_t *num_weights
 k_matsuda	i'm not familiar to SWIG/Ruby.. i dont know how to reference or pointer for native code.
 sonne|work	ok that is a bug
 k_matsuda	I want interface like : float64_t * CombinedKernel::get_subkernel_weight(void)
 k_matsuda	i use loop of get_first_kernel()/get_next_kernel() a while
 k_matsuda	very thanks for advice!
