 blackburn	wiking: here?
 wiking	blackburn: yes
 wiking	wazza?
 blackburn	wiking: I need some kind of help with QP task
 wiking	ok
 wiking	listining
 blackburn	problem is \min_s \sum_i (s_i - s*_i)
 blackburn	s.t. \sum_i s_i = k
 blackburn	0 <= s_i <= 1
 wiking	u need a solver for that?
 blackburn	I am confused
 blackburn	is it a QP task?
 wiking	about?
 blackburn	argh ()^2
 blackburn	not ()
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	\min_s \sum_i (s_i - s*_i)^2
 wiking	right?
 blackburn	QP task is x^T H x + f x
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	so what is H and f here?
 blackburn	if it is a qp
 wiking	u mean u wanna solve this with libqp?
 blackburn	yeah fits perfectly exepct H part
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	:DDD
 blackburn	I actually even have mosek calling code for that
 wiking	for which?
 blackburn	for solution of this problem
 wiking	aaah and you wanna have it instead with libqp?
 blackburn	okay actually it is (x-y)*I*(x-y)^T, right?
 blackburn	yeah would be cool to avoid mosek
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	ok
 wiking	only question is what is s*_i?
 blackburn	it is given
 wiking	ah cool
 wiking	so you only have s as a vector
 blackburn	everything is known
 wiking	and another s* vector
 blackburn	except s
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	and wanna minimize your s*
 wiking	i mean s
 wiking	;p
 wiking	ok get is
 wiking	get it
 blackburn	the other option is to use nlopt but I am confused whether it can be considered as qp
 wiking	well
 wiking	x = s
 wiking	x^T = s*
 wiking	and define Q that it creates s-s*
 wiking	only question here with the ^2 part
 wiking	but the problem is that in qp definition
 wiking	you have actually xHx^t
 wiking	so that x is the same
 wiking	:S
 blackburn	hmm wait
 blackburn	what if x = s - s*
 blackburn	then H = identity
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	\sum_i x_i = k - \sum_i s*_i
 wiking	u can do that
 wiking	H is positive semi-def in that way
 blackburn	s*_i < x_i < 1+s*_i
 blackburn	does it make sense to you?
 wiking	it was 0 < s_i < 1
 wiking	right?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	yep
 wiking	try it
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	looks legit
 blackburn	wiking: funny thing is that problem size is usually <100 here
 blackburn	but I just don't know how to work with mosek :D
 wiking	:P
 wiking	i dont approve mosek

 blackburn	uricamic: hey, around?
-!- splade [~splade@117.79.233.241] has left #shogun []
 uricamic	blackburn: yep
 blackburn	uricamic: I have some struggles with libqp
 uricamic	go on
 blackburn	I am solving following problem
 blackburn	\min_s \sum_i (s_i - s*_i)^2,      s.t.     \sum_i s_i = k,    0 <= s_i <= 1
 blackburn	s* and k are given
 uricamic	ok
 blackburn	so I introduced x = s - s*
 blackburn	then the problem became
 blackburn	\min_x \sum_i x_i^2       s.t.     \sum_i x_i = k - \sum_i s*_i
 blackburn	0-s*_i <= x <= 1-s*_i
 blackburn	uricamic: does it look ok?
 blackburn	I am unsure such thing is allowed here
 uricamic	it seems to be ok
 uricamic	but I have to look on it more carefully
 blackburn	uricamic: main problem is that I got solution not in bounds with gsmo for some reason
 uricamic	aha
 uricamic	unfortunately Vojta is not here, so I can't ask him, but I will try to look on it more carefully
 blackburn	it sets bounds
 blackburn	[-0.5,0.5]
 blackburn	argh bad example
 blackburn	it looks like solution stays at initial point here :D
 uricamic	:)
 blackburn	uricamic: does it depend on initial guess?
 uricamic	not sure, what does the return value says?
 blackburn	1 iteration, KKT
 blackburn	objective = 0.0
 blackburn	so
 blackburn	lb = -0.5
 uricamic	I mean the exitflag
 blackburn	ub = 0.5
 blackburn	exitflag = 4
 blackburn	b = 1.0
 blackburn	but solution is x = [0,0]
 uricamic	I see, I am not sure if that exitflag is good
 uricamic	but I have been just using libqp_splx only so far
 blackburn	uricamic: well it is the only non-emergency code here
 blackburn	argh no wrong
 blackburn	-1 is no memory available
 blackburn	0 is max iterations code
 blackburn	and 4 is KKT satisfied code
 uricamic	I see, so it should be ok, but it is strange though
 uricamic	in gsmo the exitflag cannot be 1, 2 or 3, tight?
 uricamic	right?
 blackburn	yeah it seems so
 uricamic	in that case 4 should be ok
 blackburn	I set initial x to [10,10]
 blackburn	and it did nothing with it actually
 blackburn	I think there is some illformed vector here
 uricamic	I am looking on the webpage of libqp now, and it seems that your constraints are not ok for it now
 uricamic	there is just x^T a = b
 blackburn	yeah but what is wrong with it?
 blackburn	I set a to ones
 uricamic	but in your task you said that constraints are sum_i x_i = k - sum_i s^*_i
 blackburn	but s* is given
 uricamic	I see, ok
 blackburn	so I just b = k - sum_i s*_i
 uricamic	sure
 uricamic	ok, in that case it should be ok
 uricamic	have you tried without using initial solution?
 blackburn	how to do that?
 blackburn	I just tried x = [1000 , 1000] and libqp made it a solution.. strange
 uricamic	it depends also how have you set the TolKKT parameter
 blackburn	in doc here
 blackburn	I set it to 1e-6
 uricamic	and of course on the initial solution provided
 blackburn	it is stated here that x 'must be feasible'
 blackburn	does it mean initial solution should satisfy bound?
 uricamic	sure, I guess
 blackburn	should it satisfy a'x=b then?
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn	uh that is another optimization problem then :D
 droopy	blackburn, ^_^
 uricamic	:)
 blackburn	uricamic: but seriously - how to do that initial guess

 puffin444	hello os252
 os252	hi puffin444
 puffin444	how are things?
 os252	ok, still little time due to family matters. Sorry for having been difficult to reach.
 os252	How are things on your end?
 puffin444	that's okay
 os252	good.
 os252	Fortunately you are on top of everything, so I am not really needed ;-)
 puffin444	good finally done with the gradient stuff
 os252	Nice,so including all the ARD variants ?
 puffin444	now working on some vis. demos and fitc
 puffin444	yes the ard works nicely
 os252	perfect
 os252	its separate kernels?
 puffin444	there are ard linear and gaussian kernels
 os252	yeah, I guess that's all for nwo.
 os252	I was wondering whether it's worth porting the matern kernel.
 puffin444	the weights can be learned thtough gradient search
 os252	It is a bit rougher and not quite as smooth as Gaussian.
 os252	Statisticians like it...
 os252	and has some good properties.
 os252	But I'd put somewhere further down on the list - there are probably more exciting things than implementing exotic kernels :-).
 puffin444	interesting. never heard of that kernel
 os252	The periodic kernels are also sort of cool.
 os252	If you want to get inspiration:
 os252	http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW4.pdf
 os252	(4.31) is a cool kernel.
 os252	It basically is like a squared exponential with prior knowledge that the function you are regressing is periodic.
 os252	It\s cool to do spectral decomposition form a just a handful of points;you can optimize the hyper parameter that corresponds to the period length and read of what's happening.
 puffin444	hmm... I was hoping to implement fitc/laplacian first if thats okay
 os252	Could be means to get good demos - but you really decide what you like, there is infinite freedom to put some cool demos together.
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@109.226.92.17] has joined #shogun
 os252	Totally. I just thought I through up some ideas for demos that illustrate what you can do with GPs and cannot easily with SVMs etc.
 puffin444	that way adding exotic kernels/likelihoods would be an easy task
 puffin444	yes i am looking at gpml for inspirarion for the denos
 puffin444	demos*
 os252	Agree - and as I already pushed for the ARD stuff, let's defer that one for later. But take a look at that stuff.
 puffin444	demos*
 puffin444	i am hoping to do something similar via matploylib
 os252	What have you got so far?
 puffin444	matplotlib
 puffin444	frankly i dont have demos yet, been looking at fitc
 os252	Yes, I understand - more fun to do.
 puffin444	but i plan to have at least some simple demos by the rnd of the week
 os252	I have some old code for sausage plots in matplotlib
 os252	https://github.com/PMBio/pygp/blob/master/pygp/plot/gpr_plot.py
 os252	some super simple simulation, but it's similar to things in gpml
 os252	is here
 os252	https://github.com/PMBio/pygp/blob/master/pygp/demo/demo_gpr.py
 os252	As suggested before. I'd vote for simple demos now and more complex things at the end of all this.
 os252	Have you read the unfitting sparse GP approximations paer?
 puffin444	yes these might be quite useful
 os252	I think it will be very helpful to get an efficient implementation of a general framework for sparse approximations (including fits).
 os252	*fitc
 puffin444	yes i have looked at it briefly a fee times
 puffin444	gew*
 puffin444	few* lol
 os252	:-)
 os252	It may make sense to discuss this if you like.
 os252	The approximations are certainly non-trivial.
 os252	and take a bit of time to get into.
 puffin444	there was a paper i found that compared many sparse methods, but i think its safest now to look at fitc
 os252	yes, there are several comparisons. FITc is definitely high up in the ranking.
 puffin444	as i can compare it directly to gpml
 os252	Yeah, it's brill that they have this all implemented :-)
 puffin444	lots of potential math error implementing this
 os252	But let me know if you want to discuss. The initialization of the pseudo points etc. can be a bit of a tricky business.
 os252	Another question is how to handle the pseudo points.
 puffin444	yes its wonderful they have it in gpml
 os252	Effectively they are parameters like everything else in the covariance.
 os252	The question is how to best incorporate this into your framework.
 os252	Definitely. That's why C++ is not the best prototyping language (at least for me).

 puffin444_	yes it is something that i have been thinking about

 os252	B.t.w Sergey has switched shogun to Eigen, right?
 os252	You could consider coding up the maths for this stuff in Eigen.
 os252	It will be a lot less pain than native blas/lapack calls.
 puffin444_	yes that would be wonderful
 os252	I am not aware of the latest state of the play but this: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.eigen/3344 suggests it's in there yet.
 blackburn	os252: moreover I am already using it for my algorithms
 os252	I think Eigen is superb in particular if you are porting code from matlaby/python like scripting languages. You can almost copy & paste thins.
 os252	blackburn: are the libraries copied into shogun?
 os252	or is there an external dependency?
 blackburn	os252: no, we rely on dependency
 blackburn	it can be a problem though
 os252	is it optional or a requirement, i.e. can core code use Eigen ?
 puffin444_	yes this might make things muxh rasier
 blackburn	what is core?
 os252	Well, not sure. GP support of course ;-)
 puffin444_	well already gp only works with lapack installed
 blackburn	I don't actually know whether we can make it mandatory
 puffin444_	is there a performance difference with eigen
 blackburn	yes, and performance of coding in particular
 os252	Yeah, numerically it's bit faster than black/lapack, coding is orders of magnitude ;-)
 blackburn	puffin444_: it uses SSE stuff if you know what it is
 puffin444_	oh wow, so do we keep lapack just because it runs on more pkayforms?
 os252	I think they really tackled the last bottle necks. You can even now put Intel MKL underneath to get multi-core support for large matrices (which Eigen does not have yet).
 blackburn	puffin444_: we still have lapack code..
 os252	but Eigen has lapak interfaces. Blackburn: have you explored whether those are sufficient for Shogun?
 blackburn	os252: problem is that they are provided only in standalone packages
 blackburn	so if you install it on say debian/ubuntu
 blackburn	you get no blas/lapack headers provided
 os252	but otherwise they work?
 os252	If yes: I am really wondering why not copy all of Eigen into shogun and kick all the lapas/black dependencies.
 blackburn	let me check
 os252	Linalg is sufficiently "central" to justify to few kilobyte of third party code I guess.
 blackburn	I am not big fan of integrating code actually
 blackburn	eigen3 is being developed pretty fast still
 os252	It surely is a tradeoff - I completely understand.
 blackburn	lapack and blas haven't changed for years
 os252	But either way: if you add stuff to shogun that depends on Eigen I see now reason why puffin444 should code up sophisticated PG linalg in lapack.
 blackburn	no just guard it with HAVE_EIGEN3
 blackburn	it is not a problem actually
 os252	vgood.
 os252	The fitc stuff is pretty complicated and it will take a lot of time to code this up in lapak otherwise.
 os252	*lapack
 os252	puffin444: have you used Eigen before? Keen on going down that route?
 puffin444_	yes especially the derivatives i found out that  i have my work cut out for me
 blackburn	os252: puffin444_: see shogun/lib/malsar folder - a few examples of eigen3 code are here
 puffin444_	okay
 os252	Sorry. I was not aware that it's already sorted and ok to use Eigen in shogun; otherwise would have pointed this out earlier. Surely all the linalg you need is pretty messy...
 puffin444_	Yes but it is workable
 os252	I'd suggest to then use Eigen for the GP stuff. You can also mix and match as you see fit.
 puffin444_	will do
 puffin444_	os252, anything more you would like to discuss?
 blackburn	actually you can gain pretty much with eigen3
 blackburn	e.g. afaik lapack has no LDL'
 blackburn	I remember you were using cholesky somewhere

 blackburn	oh famous cwidmer is in
 blackburn	:)
 puffin444_	yes actually everwhere :)
 droopy	8)
 blackburn	puffin444_: LDLT is something more stable IIRC
 blackburn	works for semi-definite
 puffin444_	okay
 os252	Yes, Eigen has LDLT which is quite nice. It's also quite fast.
 os252	I have some basic GP code for a very applied project in Eigen; I'd be happy to just send it. You could get some inspiration of Eigen for this purpose.
 puffin444_	sure that would be great
 os252	I'll just put it into an email and you'll see what you can use.
 puffin444_	okay
 os252	sent
 os252	ok, anything else we should discuss now?
 os252	Definitely ping when you need input on the sparse stuff.
 puffin444_	nothing else on my mind
 puffin444_	will do
 os252	Great. Then happy coding!
 puffin444_	ok! :)

@sonney2k	wiking, so what is the problem / where are you stuck?
@sonney2k	gsomix, how is it going?
 gsomix	sonney2k, working and reading numpy code.
 wiking	sonney2k: so solver
 wiking	sonney2k: need to do some redesigning there to be able to handle both primal mosek and the bmrm solver
 wiking	sonney2k: had a chat today with uricamic about it, and we've agreed on some changes
@sonney2k	wiking, but you know what to do?
@sonney2k	ok
 wiking	yep
 wiking	now i'm trying it out
@sonney2k	ok then
@sonney2k	gsomix, still about the slicing / dictionary?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yes, this numpy code is not well commented.

@sonney2k	gsomix, but can't you determine the types of the PyObjects
@sonney2k	wiking, is your PR ready to be merged or will it break things?
@sonney2k	I meant will it still compile and other (unrelated) stuff still work.
 wiking	sonney2k: it compiled for me
 wiking	so it shouldn't break anything
@sonney2k	wiking, ok then
 gsomix	sonney2k, I can and I know that [a:b, c:d] in my_cool_features[bla, bla] is tuple
@sonney2k	wiking, btw could you figure out why the linking error occurs on *bsd
 wiking	sonney2k: not yet
@sonney2k	gsomix, and the sub-elements?
 wiking	sonney2k: that's a really weird thing
 wiking	sonney2k: i think i have a conflict there... since most of the .so are compiled with cc and c++ (which is 4.2.x)
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, at know I can say that it is not array or sequence.
 wiking	so that's why ldd shows that libshogun.so will depend on that other libstdc++
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmhh mixture of gcc 3.X and 4.X?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	sonney2k: since we have to use 4.6 gcc on that machine because of that gcc bug
 wiking	but maybe i'm just doing something fishy there
@sonney2k	wiking, well can you explicitly force gcc 4.6 for the examples then?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yes!
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes?!
 gsomix	sub_elements are PySlices, huh.
 gsomix	obviously
@sonney2k	ok then :)
 gsomix	but little deep in python docs.

 wiking	 LIBRARY_PATH="LD_LIBRARY_PATH" LIB_PATH="//usr/local/lib"         INC_PATH="//usr/local/include" LIBS="-Xlinker --no-undefined  -lshogun" LD_LIBRARY_PATH=//usr/local/lib INCLUDES="-I. -I..  -I/usr/local/include/json   -I/usr/local/include/libxml2 -I/usr/local/include   -I../libshogun -I.." MAKE="gmake" ./check.sh
 wiking	make
 wiking	in check.sh i did an echo $MAke
 wiking	i mean echo $MAKE
 wiking	and it's make and not gmake
 wiking	which is very weird
@sonney2k	wiking, well either git pull again or change the test -n "$MAKE" line
@sonney2k	to test -z
 wiking	sonney2k: i'll wait now
 wiking	since it's building
 wiking	:)
 wiking	and i was using the build dir of the bot to do the tests
 wiking	3 more mins
 wiking	sonney2k: is there a way to do gmake -j4 ?
 wiking	or soemthing like this
 wiking	sonney2k: ok so the problem is now the following
 wiking	ok let me check it for 100% before i start telling b.s.
 wiking	huh so first of all
 wiking	not the right c++ is used for building the libshogun examples
@sonney2k	wiking, set MAKEFLAGS="-j4"
 wiking	sonney2k: i mean that u should change that in the buildbot
 wiking	since there's really free cpu there in the machine
 wiking	so
 wiking	CC=c++
 wiking	in examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile
 wiking	which will not be ok, since i've used c++46 for building the libshogun
 wiking	so that should be set as well by ./configure script not just when building libshogun itself
 wiking	but the examples as well
 wiking	but even then i'm seeing some weird shit
 wiking	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/home/wiking/shogun-buildbot/bsd1_-_libshogun/build/src/shogun ./basic_minimal
 wiking	this give me
 wiking	/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.11 required by /usr/home/wiking/shogun-buildbot/bsd1_-_libshogun/build/src/shogun/libshogun.so.12
 wiking	i'm trying to find info about this
 wiking	ok i think i see wtf
 wiking	just a sec i'll try to experiment with some extra compiler flags
 wiking	;)
 wiking	ok i think the problem occures here when it's linking the libshogun.so
 wiking	that it doesn't link it to the right libstdc++.so.6
-!- os252 [~stegle@e179243147.adsl.alicedsl.de] has left #shogun []
 gsomix	>> You probably do not want to use this function. | in python docs :)
 wiking	woah i've just seen in a printed book a screenshot of netscape navigator :DDD
 wiking	gsomix: then u most defintely should use it :)
 droopy	cool!?! ;>
 gsomix	droopy, what do you think about higgs boson?
 droopy	i'll re-pm you on this serv if pm is actually 'private'!?!
* gsomix sighs
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rfa6ce12 / (2 files in 2 dirs): pass COMP_CPP through for compiling libshogun examples - http://git.io/sudcZg
@sonney2k	wiking, another attempt...
 wiking	sonney2k: okey! will check
 wiking	or wait till it builds
@sonney2k	yeah better that then
@sonney2k	wiking, btw do you have some nice graphics produced w/ the help of shogun?
@sonney2k	I am trying to create some kind of gallery
@sonney2k	illustrating various applications/use cases/benchmarks whatever for the new website
 wiking	sonney2k: will do it for you
 blackburn	I have one idea but I need someone blender skilled :D
 droopy	grin ^_^
 wiking	sonney2k: i'll create some screenshots for the latent svm
 wiking	sonney2k: but we can even for fun make a webservice :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh
@sonney2k	wiking, you mean with security audited code like shogun's :D
 wiking	sonney2k: let say there's a cat regonizer :) and people can just upload any images to see if it locates the cat (if there's one) in the pic
@sonney2k	rieck, woudl cry :D
 wiking	sonney2k: DDDD
 wiking	sonney2k: :>
 wiking	well then just screenshots
@sonney2k	wiking, well ok that is certainly safe
@sonney2k	well to some extend
 wiking	blackburn: :>>>>>
@sonney2k	(bugs in image parsing lib)
@sonney2k	I think such examples are really highly needed
@sonney2k	what shogun can do is too abstract for everyone...
@sonney2k	except the authors :D
 wiking	:P
 wiking	ok i think i'll need to add this flag to the linker
 blackburn	I still convinced shogun is used by ten guys
 wiking	-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/gcc46
 wiking	but i'll test this now
 wiking	blackburn: :DDD
 blackburn	worst thing is that  we have outdated version in ubuntu/debian
 wiking	blackburn: dude i think the train set is down! :D
 blackburn	wiking: what do you mean?
 wiking	it downloaded :)))
 wiking	that 135 gigs
 blackburn	oooohh
 blackburn	finally
 blackburn	okay now i have no idea what to do with it
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I mean RealFeatures(traindat) wouldn't work here LOL
@sonney2k	blackburn, no just I use shogun - you all only work for me *eg*
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I tend to believe ;)
 wiking	blackburn: well now i'll upload the whole thing into the hdfs on the cluster
 wiking	and then we can run on it feature extractors
 wiking	you've said you'll create a c based hog extractor
 blackburn	aham I have to hurry up with hogs
 wiking	i'll port that retina or what the fuck was that descriptr :)
 blackburn	yeah FREAK
 blackburn	I didn't call you freak :D
 wiking	freak
 wiking	:)
 wiking	that's the one
 wiking	sonney2k: hmmm did that run well with other builders?
 wiking	i mean libshogun build this time
 wiking	ok
 wiking	sonney2k: almost... ;)

 blackburn	wiking: hmm it looks like my substitution we discussed last night was wrong
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you busy with that building stuff?
 blackburn	wiking: probably I do not cover negative and positive cases when I transform s.t. part

 wiking	sonney2k: ok
 shogun-buildbot	build #177 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/177
 wiking	sonney2k: i have the solution... but i really don't know how to add this into the configure script
 wiking	so basically i would need to give this compiler flag: -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/gcc46
 wiking	i'll try to see how's this solved usually
 wiking	with the configure script
 wiking	because now for some reason when c++46 is doing the linking
 wiking	it uses the standard /usr/lib/ path for the libgcc and libstdc++ libs
 wiking	and that'll break of course
 wiking	since it's for c++ (which is 4.2..)
 wiking	this is the only thing left to be solved and then we can enable libshogun tests on freebsd
 gsomix	good night guys
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but that is wrong
@sonney2k	gsomix, tada?
 gsomix	sonney2k, ta dam.
 gsomix	works
@sonney2k	gsomix, cool
