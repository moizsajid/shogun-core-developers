 beenish	I am getting the following error message after the command make
 beenish	[ 84%] Building C object src/shogun/CMakeFiles/shogun.dir/lib/external/PMurHash.c.o [ 84%] Building C object src/shogun/CMakeFiles/shogun.dir/lib/external/SFMT/SFMT.c.o [ 84%] Building CXX object src/shogun/CMakeFiles/shogun.dir/base/class_list.cpp.o Linking CXX shared library libshogun.so CMake Error: cmake_symlink_library: System Error: Read-only file system CMake Error: cmake_symlink_library: System Error: Read-only file system m
 beenish	any help would be appreciated
 besser82	beenish:  System Error: Read-only file system
 besser82	beenish:  That indicates some problems with your filesystem you're building on...
 besser82	beenish:  Either it is mounted read-only (which I don't believe)
 besser82	beenish:  It is not aware of handling symlinks (like ntfs or FAT)
 besser82	beenish:  or the disk is full ...
 beenish	okay i am trying to install this on the VM and the disk is shared between the host machine. I am going to build it locally on the VM and check
