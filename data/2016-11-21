 CaBa	HeikoS: is it safe to pull develop if i haven't for 4 weeks? or are there some major changes in context to the 5.x release that might make things incompatible with my code?
@HeikoS	CaBa:  nops I think should be safe
@HeikoS	CaBa: remember the old commit hash to be safe :)
 CaBa	HeikoS: sounds fishy ;_)
@HeikoS	CaBa: you can diff
@HeikoS	in github
@HeikoS	but we mostly did fixes
@HeikoS	not major changes
 CaBa	hmk...
@HeikoS	you have a git cleint locally
@HeikoS	they do these nice tree views on the changes
@HeikoS	CaBa: but why you want to upgrade
@HeikoS	you can do it when we do the next release
@HeikoS	which is soon btw
@HeikoS	5.0.1
@HeikoS	osx fixes mainly
 CaBa	osx \o/
 CaBa	what's the problem with osx? i'm on osx... ^^
 CaBa	please tell me all my accuracies are actually 40% better!
 CaBa	;-)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	nope it is a build fix
