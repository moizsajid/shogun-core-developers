 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  jojo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how are things?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: mehh I want to find some will/time to move shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how can I help?
@HeikoS	what about something concrete?
@HeikoS	I.e. links in the shogun manual? class links I mean
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we need to fully integrate it first maybe..
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that too
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but need links also, and thats easy to do
@HeikoS	I want to work on integration soon
 lisitsyn	I think that is the thing that blocks me
 lisitsyn	I don't have proper environment
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	so how do we do it
 lisitsyn	with cmake?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: should be part of the build
@HeikoS	generate the meta examples
 lisitsyn	ok let me see
@HeikoS	build doc
@HeikoS	feel free to edit this stuff
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: once done I'd move to plugins
 lisitsyn	probably I just need to start
 lisitsyn	then we will see the best way to do plugins
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sure
@HeikoS	exactly
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I also want to integrate property-based testing
@HeikoS	but the manual should be flexible enough to tolerate all those changes under the hood
@HeikoS	its just about modular bindings anyways
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah true
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you think about idea that we should work transparently on common data frames
 lisitsyn	like pandas dataframe, numpy array, spark rdd
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: very good
@HeikoS	dataframe is a good structure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but matrices are also fine for now I guess

@wiking	btw
@wiking	http://tensorflow.org/
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	have any of u seen this?
@wiking	lisitsyn: u tried it?
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	I am pessimistic actually
@wiking	hehe i'm just checking th code
@wiking	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
@wiking	btw anybody seen besser82 around? :D
 lisitsyn	oh its in python
@besser82	wiking, yes :P
 lisitsyn	wiking: I think magic platforms suck
@besser82	I'm still in the US...  ;)
@wiking	btw: $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy swig python-dev
@wiking	lisitsyn: so they use swig :>
@wiking	besser82: aaah i see :)))0
@wiking	then it's going to be hard to collaborate
@besser82	a little, yes
@besser82	will be back on Dec 1st
 lisitsyn	wiking: nips?
 lisitsyn	no?
@wiking	lisitsyn: no(
 lisitsyn	meh
@wiking	i'm going to try to defend my thesis that time
@wiking	besser82: so yeah i guess you know what i'm after :P
 lisitsyn	oh really?
 lisitsyn	cool
@besser82	wiking, the PRs, rye?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	besser82: so i was thinking maybe i should move every little thing to be it's own project?
@wiking	like say libshogun is one project
@wiking	python modular is another project
@wiking	etc.
@wiking	and then you either can have a monolithic build
@wiking	or you can build them separately
@besser82	wiking, actually two projects are enough
@besser82	libsg
@besser82	and sg-interfaces
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	and sg-interfaces would depend on libshogun yeah
@wiking	ok
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@nat-244-183.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@wiking	question about the compiler flags
@wiking	how to pass them?
@wiking	or even better
@wiking	how to share the detection of various features?
 lisitsyn	share cmake?
@wiking	say c++11 suport
 lisitsyn	like sgcmake
 lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	because how i imagine it that say you cd shogun/sg-interfaces && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
@wiking	that would do a FIND_PACKAGE for libshogun
@wiking	and in the meanwhile check whether swig is available etc
 lisitsyn	wiking: why not include sg-cmake-commons-whatever?
@wiking	but almost the same functionality is required in libshogun cmake (at least on the compiler support))
@wiking	would we just use the same cmake folder that we use now?
@wiking	but push down the find_package + compiler flags detection into both project?s
 lisitsyn	you want separate git projects?
@wiking	no
@wiking	this should be ok with the current setup
 lisitsyn	project like directory?
@wiking	only thing is that the CMakeLists.txt files should be refactored
@wiking	i've started a bit
@wiking	see config branch
@wiking	but that needs more work to be able to have a full separation
@wiking	so that we can actually build a modular interface without actually building libshogun
 lisitsyn	its pretty complicated now
@wiking	what? :)
@wiking	no
@wiking	:D
@wiking	not at allll!
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	I have no idea what you changed :)
@wiking	but yeah this i just want to have that we can finally fucking have a debian package target
@wiking	for each interface
@wiking	yeah that's normal
@wiking	but that hasn't changed since 2011
@wiking	:D
@wiking	you had no idea wha ti changed in ./configure either
@wiking	that shit was not understood by anybody except sonney2k_
@wiking	no offence to anybody
 lisitsyn	actually it was easier
 lisitsyn	because it was flat
 lisitsyn	now it is a cmess
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	cmakess
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt this one is easy
@wiking	ok then write it in whatever
@wiking	but who is going to fix it?
@wiking	and most importantly when?
 lisitsyn	nah cmake is good
@wiking	yeah 1152 lines
@wiking	it's a fucking mess
@wiking	that i agree
@wiking	i'm trying to unfuck it
@wiking	no fucking src file should ever be more than 500 lines
@wiking	at any fucking circumstances
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/CMakeLists.txt this one is not that hard
@wiking	i would actually love to see a github analysis
@wiking	LoC/file vs Programming language
 lisitsyn	wiking: should it mess with protobuf?
@wiking	yes it should since we want protobuf :>
@wiking	so what't the guess
@wiking	which language would be on top of that list?
 lisitsyn	C
 lisitsyn	make
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	and cmake
@wiking	mmm i think python would be on top
 lisitsyn	depends
 lisitsyn	but iyeah it is easy to write 1k of loc
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok so can I help you somehow?
 lisitsyn	wiking: when I am looking at the cmake stuff I want to write some functions to make it more comprehensible
 lisitsyn	does it make sense to you to function-alize it a bit
@wiking	yes of course
 lisitsyn	wiking: will it help if I shrink these find_package if endif to some functions?
 lisitsyn	it is dumb work I can do at some point when I am bored
@wiking	cool
@wiking	yeah sure
@wiking	add it to the config branch
 lisitsyn	ok
