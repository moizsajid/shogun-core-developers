@sonney2k	dvevre, I am fixing the include paths right now...
 dvevre	sonney2k: okay
 dvevre	i saw the other files like BinaryFile.h also followed the <shogun/lib/..> convention instead of "lib/"
 dvevre	hence i did the same
@sonney2k	dvevre, I really wonder how the got here
 dvevre	me too... no cpp program using AsciiFile would work
@sonney2k	dvevre, the plan was that everything in libhshogun is relative to the libshogun dir
@sonney2k	within ui and any of the interfaces we use <shogun/xxx>
 dvevre	oh.. got you
@sonney2k	the idea behind this is that one can remove the libshogun dir
@sonney2k	and things then should compile when libshogun is installed in /usr/local/include or so
 dvevre	hmm.. ok
@sonney2k	(in case libshogun and the interface code will be distributed separately)
 dvevre	sonney2k: is there a library function for line reading?
 dvevre	get_*_vector reads the whole file first
* blackburn getting irritated with that FP-tree growth algorithm

@sonney2k	blackburn, hi there...
@bettyboo	?
 CIA-110	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r080b05b / data : update data to include new tests - http://bit.ly/fM8cgx
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's up here? have I missed sth? ;)
@bettyboo	;D
@sonney2k	blackburn, most of the tests finally run through now
@sonney2k	took quite a while to fix the anova kernel...
 blackburn	anova kernel wasn't working?
@sonney2k	serialization - no and array inits were missing and special case order > length also crashed the kernel...
 blackburn	oh, andrey's fault, btw he disappeared for some reason
@sonney2k	probably because I am such a bastard
 blackburn	why you are?
 blackburn	hm, you fixed my test also
@sonney2k	because I am touching everyones code and asking for *lots* of changes
 blackburn	don't think so
 blackburn	sonney2k: how did you noticed what error with d>length?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I was running the test suite -> crash / valgrind errors
@sonney2k	blackburn, you defined this as test case 2!
 blackburn	ah..
 blackburn	but not me, seems andrey did
 blackburn	sonney2k: my fault didn't noticed that anova faults
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about other kernels?
@sonney2k	well serilization at least works
@sonney2k	I put them in the test suite
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	at least we can't test their 'mercerness' :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is actually pretty cool to debug things now - one just has to call python testet.py from the testsuite/python_modular/
@sonney2k	and can even specify --debug for more output or single example file names that failed to inspect only them
 blackburn	aha, I see
 blackburn	oh, have to finish work on evaluation..
 blackburn	but will do it a bit later
 blackburn	alesis overworked? ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, that's nice - we can then have tests for these measures too :)
@sonney2k	looks like...
@sonney2k	blackburn, how is your cold? feeling better?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah, getting better day by day ;) thanks
 blackburn	but today will not code though
@sonney2k	blackburn, shogun gives you a healthy living style and makes you sexy :D
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	lazy you ;-)
 blackburn	not so lazy :) just tired
@sonney2k	blackburn, I know what you mean
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it true that in Germany youths learning in school during 13 years?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what?
 blackburn	eh.. sorry wrote some mess
-!- dvevre [b49531e5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.229] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: how long are pupils learning at school in Germany?
@sonney2k	13 years
 blackburn	hmm and graduating at 19?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not sure what graduating means
 blackburn	eh. sorry again
@sonney2k	we get the 'abitur' then
 blackburn	finish studying, etc
@sonney2k	I left school with 19 or 20 IIRC
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	then 1 year civil service and then could finally start studying
 blackburn	it is so uncommonly for me ;)
 blackburn	i'm 20 now :D
 blackburn	what is civil service?
 blackburn	and what about army?

 blackburn	btw, do I divert you? ) wiil stop if so
@sonney2k	blackburn, army or civil service
 blackburn	ah, I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't had to go to army, but should go after graduating from university
 blackburn	but hope for get some other way to not go in army :D
@sonney2k	too late for me
 blackburn	too late what?
@sonney2k	I could be your father now *lol*
 blackburn	eh, how old are you? though ~35?
 blackburn	my father is 50 yr old now
 blackburn	aha! I calculated! :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can you be my father :D having children being 15 year old isn't a good idea

 blackburn	sonney2k: seems you will not have problems with deduplication
@sonney2k	blackburn, we might have one ...
 blackburn	one? he
 blackburn	*hehe I mean

 blackburn	I see, so we better should be at #gsoc on 22, yeap?
* blackburn imagines a channel with >1K people 
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't actually know yet. I hope we will know tomorrow or the day after if we have duplicates
@sonney2k	anyway
@sonney2k	I am tired...
