 woofwoofola	hi, i need some help w shogun-3.0.0 on mac osx 10.8.4
 woofwoofola	compiled and installed it, but I'm not getting the expected result (as described in the install)
 woofwoofola	no sg.mexglx or sg.mexa64 or sg.mexmac (as described)
 woofwoofola	instead, in the location described by the install...
 woofwoofola	src/interfaces/matlab_static
 woofwoofola	which is assumed relative to (subdir of) <shogun>/build/
 woofwoofola	I have 1 library: libmatlab_static.dylib
 woofwoofola	and under src/shogun (also a relative path)
 woofwoofola	I have 3 libraries: libshogun.dylib libshogun.14.dylib and libshogun.14.0.dylib
 woofwoofola	I observed a past IRC chat asking about how to get the mex file
 woofwoofola	so I tried to use matlab's mex command on the first library libmatlab_static.dylib
 woofwoofola	mex libmatlab_static.dylib
 woofwoofola	but mex requires a sourcefile, not just a library file (or dynamically linked library file in this case)
 woofwoofola	btw, I've met the prerequisites: mex_setup (right result?) and matlab in path starts from cmd line
 woofwoofola	in matlab, also tried loadlibrary pointing to the libshogun.dylib (at the path above) and its header file under /usr/local/include
 woofwoofola	...but when it tries to resolve other header files referred to it can't find them
 woofwoofola	and I've tried starting matlab in a couple of places to try resolving that, but that did not work (to my surprise)
 woofwoofola	and someone please help me?  Shogun is built and ready to use but the interface to matlab I built is not hooked up!
 woofwoofola	also the install refers to test starting matlab in a certain path (and then adding another path) -- and neither of those paths exist in my installation

 thoralf	Hey.
 thoralf	My "Highspeed-Glasfaser-Kabelnetz Internet" is only slow from 20-24 o'clock, holidays or weekends. ;)
 thoralf	Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
 thoralf	Grr.
 thoralf	Fuck.
 thoralf	Ey.
 thoralf	No matter what I do.
 thoralf	Walking in a mine field.
 besser82	thoralf: lucky one  :)
 besser82	thoralf: I actually get the 100MBit/s during 0 - 4 AM only...
 besser82	thoralf: @~3pm everything is as slow as a 14K4-Dial-up...
 besser82	thoralf: only upload stays @6MBit/s...
 besser82	thoralf: What are you doing, causing a prog to SEGFAULT?
 thoralf	besser82: This time it was a trivial and known problem: Having a script and doing everything in the main() function
 thoralf	Calling exit_shogun()
 thoralf	And when closing the scope, I got a segfault.
 thoralf	Because shogun was already gone, but it tried to destroy a CTime object.
 besser82	thoralf: one simply doesn't call exit() before destroying all instances...  :-P
 thoralf	Haha, thank you. ;)
 thoralf	I simply but a {} around everything init() and exit()...
 thoralf	everything except ...
 thoralf	About KD: Calling the hotline and complaining usually works well.
 thoralf	And: I've got only 16MBits/s.  So the difference is not that big.
 thoralf	The throughput is not the problem - more annoying is the increased latency.
 thoralf	Gotta go.
 thoralf	Have fun. ;)
