@HeikoS	lambday: hey!
@HeikoS	how are things?
 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
 lambday	lol almost slept!
 lambday	checking out code quadratic time mmd and linear mmd
@HeikoS	lambday: haha
@HeikoS	lambday: probably full of bugs ;)
 lambday	logical bugs?
@HeikoS	lambday: hopefully not,
@HeikoS	lambday: but I unit tested against arthurs implementation
@HeikoS	so should be ok
 lambday	:D
 lambday	btw the only unit test we have on this is for quadratic mmd
@HeikoS	no linear time test?
 lambday	no - check tests/unit/statistic
@HeikoS	lambday: there might be examples where I added assertions, from the days before unit tests
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - you used those in libshogun tests thogh
@HeikoS	lambday: ther are linear time mmd tests
@HeikoS	TEST(LinearTimeMMD,test_linear_mmd_fixed)
@HeikoS	lambday: no hsic
@HeikoS	lambday: let me write an entrance task ;)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: HAVE_EIGEN3 guard changes to counter make error w/o eigen3
 lambday	argh - *rubs eyes*
@HeikoS	lambday: dont forget to sleep in between
 lambday	HeikoS: hsic one should be same as the example where you asserted mean/vars right?
 lambday	hehe!
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah the examples in fact should just demonstrate API and not do complicated stuff
@HeikoS	lambday:  all non-trivial stuff should be in the notebook, examples just for API, testing only in unit tests
@HeikoS	lambday: this is all old stuff before we did things properly
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - so I'll pull those assertions inside unit test then
 lambday	hmm
 lambday	HeikoS: wow my work is forking up - see https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1930
 lambday	:D
@HeikoS	lambday:  yeah, good isnt it?
 lambday	yep :D
@HeikoS	lambday: you could go for it if interested
@HeikoS	lambday: no need to solve the whole gsoc project already ;)
 lambday	haha! :D
 lambday	lol you just mentioned what I was about to say regarding min/max
@HeikoS	lambday: feel free to elaborate on that
@HeikoS	you wrote all the stuff an know best
@HeikoS	lambday: you could maybe guide someone in doing this
@HeikoS	lambday: feel free to point someone to do this
@HeikoS	lambday: since its very useful for us
 sunil1337	@HeikoS: please take a  look at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1887 and tell me what exactly is needed i've create the new method
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I hope this stuff would be useful - will share ideas on that whatever I can
@HeikoS	lambday: ah that one....
 lambday	HeikoS: btw quadratic mmd sample_null_spectrum should get rid of lapack and depend on eigen, right? changing it then
@HeikoS	lambday: I guess we want a copy method and a return reference method
@HeikoS	lambday: and the reference method is not possible when a subset is set
 lambday	HeikoS: ummm you meant sunil1337 :P
@HeikoS	lambday: the problem here is if we decide to change the feature matrix
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe we should leave that for now
 sunil1337	@HeikoS: yup
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah totally, in fact CStatistics should get rif of the covariance method, this should just be done with eigen
@HeikoS	lambday: I closed the 1887
@HeikoS	not really clear what I want there, and its not important for now

 sunil1337	@HeikoS: lol...:D
 lambday	sunil1337: feel free to give 1930 a shot :)
@HeikoS	sunil1337: ah sorry
 sunil1337	lambday: sure buddy :)
@HeikoS	sunil1337: that was a stupid issue, I should not have written that ;)
 sunil1337	@HeikoS: happens all the time :) good that i din't comment :p
@HeikoS	sunil1337: always let us know once you are on something
@HeikoS	sunil1337: 1930 is cool, but a bit larger
@HeikoS	but very useful for us!
@HeikoS	lambday: can guide it :)
 aroma	Hi. I am working on  1913.
 sunil1337	@HeikoS: will see :)
 aroma	I was just wondering if implementing serialization would be better or isolated load/save functions
@HeikoS	aroma: pls write a little comment in the issue to avoid duplicate work
@HeikoS	aroma: what do you mean?
@HeikoS	aroma: could you elaborate?
@HeikoS	aroma: I added a comment, lets see what shell says
 sunil1337	@HeikoS: will be back have to google half of the stuff :P
 aroma	@HeikoS: I mean if I implement serialization, we would have to stick to certain format
 aroma	@HeikoS: certain format for  saving/storing factor graphs
@HeikoS	sunil1337: eig and eigs in matlab
@HeikoS	aroma: ask shell about that, kin the issue
@HeikoS	in
 lambday	just out of curiosity, factors graphs aren't bipartite graphs, are they?
@HeikoS	lambday: no
 aroma	@HeikoS: ok
@HeikoS	just a graph where nodes are connected via factors which are arbritary functions connecting the nodes
@HeikoS	lambday: joint distribution is product of all factors, normaliser is the integral of this over all nodes
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I remember now...
 lambday	sum product algorithm
@HeikoS	lambday: no
@HeikoS	lambday: thats for chain graphs :)
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... but I remember reading about sum product algo for factor graph somewhere - cannot recollect clearly
 sunil1337	lambday: refactor in what ways..
@HeikoS	lambday: usually one has to to loopy BP
 sunil1337	lambday: put in a GPU based solver?
@HeikoS	sunil1337: the refactoring is just about interfaces
@HeikoS	sunil1337: so no GPU solver for now
@HeikoS	just eigen3
@HeikoS	but this is about unifying
 lambday	sunil1337: yeah - if you have a look its currently only made for computing min/max eigenvalues - but we may need to change that
@HeikoS	lambday, sunil1337 the current class should be SparseEigenSolver or so
@HeikoS	lambday: and it should be possible to specify the n biuggest/smallest eigenvalues rather than one
 lambday	HeikoS: well, EigenSolver has one implementation for dense as well
@HeikoS	lambday: and the dense eigensolver should just compute all
@HeikoS	lambday: ah I see
@HeikoS	lambday: but the dense one needs an interface to compute all eigenvalues
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah!
 sunil1337	lambday: okay..
 lambday	HeikoS: I don't think we'll be needing all eigenvalues for sparse as well, or just have the interface there, keeping it virtual may be :-/
@HeikoS	no these should be two abstract classes
 lambday	HeikoS: I mean, for the purpose that wiking mentioned
@HeikoS	one for all eigenvalues and one for the n largest/smallest
@HeikoS	lambday: and all eigensolver should have convinience constructors that allow to give them SGMatrix SGSparseMatrix directly, could you make that happen (dont do it yourself, just guide sunil1337 :)
 lambday	HeikoS: oh currently it all works on linear operators, doesn't it
 lambday	yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: exactly, but its a bit annyoing sometimes to create all those classes
 lambday	true that!
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact this should also be possible for the log-det stuff. Just give the matrix and all other things are initialised by default
@HeikoS	lambday: If you want, you can write another entrance task on that :)
@HeikoS	lambday: do you want?

 lambday	HeikoS: wow - so, no explictly creating linear operators
 lambday	that would be cool!
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, imagine you want the log-determinant of a sparse matrix
@HeikoS	and just instanciate the main class with the matrix, everything else is done in the constructor to default methods
@HeikoS	lambday: thats a nice entrance task, easy code, maybe some unit tests afterwards, but thats all
 lambday	HeikoS: alright!
 sunil1337	HeikoS:,lambday: i'm up :p
 lambday	HeikoS: I will put up an entrance task on that!
 lambday	sunil1337: cool!

 thoralf	HeikoS: Regarding your question: IMO we can merge, since it fixes out-of-bound errors in the corresponding solvers, adds a unit test, etc.
 thoralf	HeikoS: But: Not all of my changes are test-backed.
@HeikoS	thoralf: any chance that happens? :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: I'd like to, but I'm in doubt it will...
@HeikoS	thoralf: is that something somebody else can do easily?
@HeikoS	thoralf: like intro task?
 thoralf	Okay, let me check.
 thoralf	Basically it's cleanup (-> BuffSize), typos in includes, adding bounds checks that didn't exist before, adding a unit test *and* fixing an off-by-one that I already fixed in the other solver.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Thoralf Klein :develop * 70453d8 / src/shogun/structure/ (5 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/70453d8384397010416a239378d472e6373fef43
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Different simple fixes:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: * Getting imports right (mixed up libp3bm.h and libppbm.h)
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: * Not defining BufSize in every so solver by defining it extern in libbmrm.h
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: * Correcting wrong initialization of beta[i+1] in libppbm.cpp
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: * Termination criteria: exit loop if next iteration would exceed CP buffer
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Thoralf Klein :develop * a7f8ec5 / tests/unit/structure/DualLibQPBMSOSVM_unittest.cc: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/a7f8ec53fcd4e98391ea4a31af960d3a2d23bae9
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Using gtest to run the same tests for all solvers.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: * Outsourced dummy data to helper functions create_test_labels() and create_test_features().

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Testing all bundle method solvers (plus cleaning and bugfixes)
 thoralf	Cool.
 thoralf	HeikoS: First use of parametrized unit-tests: tests/unit/structure/DualLibQPBMSOSVM_unittest.cc
 thoralf	In case you need an example.
@HeikoS	thoralf: ah sweet
@HeikoS	I saw that in stan today and liked it there :)
@HeikoS	thoralf: btw EXPECT is better in unit test, it doesnt terminate the program and other EXPECTS can be checked, ASSERT blocks directly, so should only be used if the program otherwise would crash (like null pointer read)
 thoralf	I know, but if in doubt (or too lazy or too tired) I'm using asserts. ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: lazy boy :)
@HeikoS	thoralf: ok I am off home now
@HeikoS	see you!
 thoralf	Bye.

 lisitsyn_	PirosB3: hey, I am currently reading your saas proposal
 PirosB3	yay :)
 lisitsyn_	it sounds quite cool indeed
 PirosB3	what do you think of it
 lisitsyn_	the only thing worries me
 PirosB3	oh thanks
 lisitsyn_	is that it is like a huge amount of work
 PirosB3	I know, for this reason I want all the community to discuss feasible deadlines and reshape the idea if necessary
 lisitsyn_	I'll think about it and write some answer later
 lisitsyn_	be sure you'll get more feedback soon
 PirosB3	but this could be the start of a big thing. I don't think other people have done it
 PirosB3	thanks lisitsyn_
 PirosB3	it means a lot, I really feel the idea can be very helpful
 lisitsyn_	there is some lag in our responses due to thing mentioned by besser82 ;)
 PirosB3	let me know when u have feedback :)
 lisitsyn_	PirosB3: I'll just answer your mail to the mailing list
 PirosB3	sure lisitsyn_  I just wanted to make sure the mail went through, as there is no way to browse the ML (or is there?)
 lisitsyn_	PirosB3: hmm actually there is

 lisitsyn_	http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun
 PirosB3	oh great
 PirosB3	lisitsyn_: in the meantime, is there something specific I should be looking at?
 lisitsyn_	PirosB3: sorry don't get it, what do you mean?
 PirosB3	well, I want to make sure I can define a good API. Are there any particular bits of shogun internals I should be looking at for this task? lisitsyn_
 lisitsyn_	PirosB3: oh well it would need to have pretty wide perspective on what we have

 lambday	HeikoS1: altough for btest we need equal numbers - according to the paer
 lambday	HeikoS1: okies
 lambday	HeikoS1: oh oh - and the statistic returned is m*MMD
 HeikoS1	lambday: yeah otherwise one cannot do blocks
 lambday	what should it be when m /= n
 HeikoS1	lambday: so orient that on the linear tim eMMD implementation
 HeikoS1	lambday: in fact, I think its only a few lines different since this one already streams blocks
 HeikoS1	lambday: but now the blocks need to be computed in quadratic time averages

 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah I use clang-complete although dunno how to use all the features :P

 HeikoS1	just compile,link and run
 cameo54321	which has its own main function
 lambday	HeikoS1: you use terminator for two screens?
 cameo54321	HeikoS1 thanks
 HeikoS1	lambday: no, I just use ubuntu ;)
 lambday	HeikoS1: vertically/horizontally terminal split is possible without any addons?

 lambday	HeikoS1: I am a bit confused since there are so many stuffs for which we'll just have to copy code from LinearTimeMMD
 lambday	HeikoS1: and I don't like multiple inheritance
 lambday	HeikoS1: but QuadraticTimeMMD has to be the base for BTestMMD I think
 HeikoS1	lambday: no BTest is yet another two sample test
 HeikoS1	lambday: or actually its closer to the linear time mmd one

 HeikoS1	lambday: I will look at bit later as I have to finish something now
 HeikoS1	but here comes sejdino
 HeikoS1	he can rewiew that :)
 HeikoS1	review
 lambday	HeikoS1: but reusing the code that quadratic time mmd already had for compute_statistic
 lambday	HeikoS1: alright
 sejdino	hey both
 lambday	sejdino: hi :D
 sejdino	how are things?
 HeikoS1	sejdino: see  - https://gist.github.com/lambday/9371699
 HeikoS1	lambday: just drafted that
 HeikoS1	sejdino: we were just discussing if btest should in herit from quadratic or linear time mmd or none
 sejdino	interesting question
 lambday	sejdino: just the idea - since quadratic time mmd already had compute_statistic which computes it the exact same way, extending it to btest mmd can use that method
 sejdino	it's kind of inbetween the two
 HeikoS1	sejdino: because linear time implementations effectively streams data in blocks, but the just averages the independent pairs
 HeikoS1	sejdino: btest would just compute quadratic time mmd on those blocks, so its very close
 HeikoS1	sejdino: but I dont know whether one can stream it, (does N need to be fixed?
 HeikoS1	)
 HeikoS1	sejdino: maybe have a look into CLinearTimeMMD::compute_statistic
 HeikoS1	to compare
 sejdino	I think you can still stream - you would just process a larger batch at once
 sejdino	but I agree that it's more practical to have it inherit quadratic time computation
 lambday	sejdino: I thought so, since the statistic is computed in the exact same way - but we're left with the option of copying a large part of the code from linear time mmd
 lambday	sejdino: in the draft I tried to see how to use QuadraticTimeMMD::compute_statistic inside BTestMMD::compute_statistic
 sejdino	maybe we can think about ways to make statistic computation a bit more modular and separate from tests?
 HeikoS1	sejdino: the linear time one already streams in blocks
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsyn@80.252.20.67] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS1	sejdino: also, kernel selection is only available for linear time MMD classes, so a subclass would immediately work with that
 lambday	HeikoS1: ummm... but current implementation of CLinearTimeMMD::compute_statistic_and_variance does compute the linear time formula - so, we gotta rewrite that anyway
 lambday	unless we can separate it
 HeikoS1	lambday: no I agree, but the way the data is accessed is the same
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah that's the same
 HeikoS1	stream block-> compute something
 sejdino	HeikoS1: it processes them in blocks which is great but computes only linear time statistic
 lambday	HeikoS1: you think we can may be have a separate base class for streaming features - which does all that
 lambday	then have linear/quadratic time formulas fed on in some subclasses?
 HeikoS1	lambday: yeah maybe
 HeikoS1	so another class streamingMMD from that linear time and Btest inherit
 HeikoS1	lambday: but wait
 HeikoS1	I think stiull the btest should inherit from linear time mmd
 HeikoS1	it is a linear time test, the null distribution is based on that
 HeikoS1	so the kernel selection things work immediately
 HeikoS1	check out their code
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah all same - just the formula is different :-/

 HeikoS1	lambday: ok what about pulling the streaming code into a base class then?
 HeikoS1	or copy it
 lambday	HeikoS1: including the multiple kernels part?
 HeikoS1	lambday:  ah that
 HeikoS1	lambday: yeah that also works for the btest
 lambday	yep!
 sejdino	HeikoS1: do they actually do any kernel selection in the paper?
 HeikoS1	so why not have CStreamingMMD->CLinearTimeMMD->CBTestMMD ?
 HeikoS1	sejdino: yeah they do
 HeikoS1	lambday: and the streaming feature blocks code is in CStreamingMMD
 lambday	HeikoS1: and copy the code from QuadraticTimeMMD::compute_statistic  to BTestMMD?
 HeikoS1	lambday: or you leave things in CLinearTimeMMD and call an abstract method in the compute statistic code
 HeikoS1	which then is overloaded
 HeikoS1	lambday: I think that might be best in fact
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah that's what I was thinkin'
 lambday	oh wait wait -
 HeikoS1	lambday: the code that updates the statistic is in an overloaded method and BTest just modifies that to compute the quadratic statistic
 lambday	HeikoS1: ummmm - still copying code :(
 HeikoS1	lambday: no, just have an instance of CQuadraticTimeMMD in the BTest
 HeikoS1	as a member
 HeikoS1	and then pass the block to it
 lambday	HeikoS1: ah that works - might look a bit ugly but works
 sejdino	HeikoS1: that seems like a nice solution
 sejdino	we might think about a different name for quadratic time mmd to make things less confusing
 HeikoS1	sejdino: like ?
 sejdino	it's basically just a UStatistic or VStatistic MMD
 sejdino	which one are you using?
-!- khalednasr [c4dd5cc1@gateway/web/freenode/ip.196.221.92.193] has joined #shogun
 sejdino	biased or unbiased?
 lambday	sejdino: both are implemented
 lambday	sejdino: default is unbiased
 HeikoS1	sejdino: both possible
 HeikoS1	sejdino: but the point is that quadratic uses all pairs
 HeikoS1	so quadratic is a good name isnt it?
 HeikoS1	and linear just computes averages of independent things
 HeikoS1	and b test does that too, but those independent things are blocks
 sejdino	I see, so you can basically in each of the B tests call either U or V?
 HeikoS1	so its actually a linear time statistic (on blocks)
 HeikoS1	sejdino: yeah
 sejdino	well, yes, unless you're using two blocks :)
 sejdino	then it becomes quadratic time
 sejdino	but then the kernel selection doesn't work
 HeikoS1	sejdino: so what do you suggest?
 sejdino	HeikoS1: well, we could let the number of blocks be specified freely
-!- sunil1337 [0e8bd057@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.139.208.87] has joined #shogun
 sejdino	but then we need to worry about the asymptotics not being valid
 sejdino	if the number of blocks is very small compared to the number of samples
 sejdino	I think it's better not to allow specifying the number of blocks but actually to specify the number of samples within a block?
 HeikoS1	sejdino: yeah sampler per block is better, in particular if we are stremaing
 HeikoS1	streaming
 sejdino	exactly
 HeikoS1	sejdino: and then always do independent things as for linear time mmd. so both classes immediately can be plugged into the kernel selection classes
 lisitsyn	hey guys

 lambday	sejdino: HeikoS1: so specify the block-size, as they do in their matlab implementation
 HeikoS1	lambday: yeah!
 sejdino	lambday: yes, that sounds good
 HeikoS1	lambday: so people can decide how many points they want to stream
 HeikoS1	lambday: make sure b<n ;)
 sejdino	I would say even b<0.1n
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah :D in the matlab code they assert (blocksize >= 2 && blocksize < m / 3);
 sejdino	for the kernel selection part
 sejdino	but I guess we can allow even 2 blocks just to run a test
 lisitsyn	lambday: are you going to apply for this task?
 sejdino	because permutation test will still give correct p-value
 HeikoS1	sejdino: agreed!
 lambday	sejdino: alright
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah :D
 lisitsyn	lambday: I see :)
 HeikoS1	sejdino, lambday it will be interesting to reproduce the paper results in the notebook, i.e. compare gaussian approximation to samples from the null via permutation
 sejdino	lisitsyn: we've had some excellent progress on the project already - lambday has been driving it :)
 lisitsyn	sejdino: that's the ideal thing
 lisitsyn	that's how HeikoS1 joined shogun
 lisitsyn	well and I did something like that
 sejdino	HeikoS1: I agree absolutely - it would be very nice to plot and see how it goes to a Gaussian as the number of blocks increases
 HeikoS1	lambday: see the plots in the paper
 HeikoS1	sejdino: do you want to write an intro task on reproducing that?
