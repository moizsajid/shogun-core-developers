 hpsoar	hi, my github id is hpsoar
 hpsoar	today, I compiled and installed shogun on my notebook with linux os
 hpsoar	just now, i set up my github tools, and successfully sent a pull request test
 hpsoar	I had encountered some problems when install shogun, and run the examples

 hpsoar	1. firstly, I install through apt-get, but the examples doesn't work with errors like "cannot import name AveragedPerceptron"
 n4nd0	hpsoar: hey! so the pacakge is not really up to date
 n4nd0	hpsoar: you should try to compile and install from source, the code in github
 hpsoar	yes, I reinstalled through the source code
 hpsoar	the examples can run, but some ends up unconverged
 n4nd0	hpsoar: I am not sure if I follow
 n4nd0	hpsoar: so it seems that you are trying out python examples, did you install with python support?
 hpsoar	yes
 n4nd0	./configure --interfaces=python_modular ??
 hpsoar	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	and you are able or not to run examples?
 hpsoar	yes
 n4nd0	then everything is good :)
 hpsoar	ok, I want participate in the gsoc project, I think I need to spend some time getting familiar with the project. thanks for your help~

 blackburn	hpsoar: it seems we've got some misunderstanding at pull request point
 blackburn	have you subscribed to the mailing list?
 hpsoar	yes
 blackburn	hpsoar: I clarified it a little, we intent that students could help with some improvements
 blackburn	but not some test thing
 hpsoar	doesn't the project require a pull request test to make sure that the version control can work correctly
 hpsoar	I know that, I have already viewed the ideas proposed
 blackburn	no, github works well anyway
 blackburn	we suggest students to make real pull requests
 blackburn	that's what I mean
 blackburn	hpsoar: according to things you said before (I checked logs) - contact mentor(s) of idea(s) you are interested with
 hpsoar	oh, sorry
 blackburn	no problem
 hpsoar	I haved already pull the source to my machine, ok, thank you

 sonne|work	blackburn: thx for the clarification email
 blackburn	sonne|work: lol
 sonne|work	btw - I think I know what is wrong with tests
 blackburn	what?
 sonne|work	serialization seems to not work
 blackburn	oh awesome
 sonne|work	no idea why though
 sonne|work	pickle.dumps()/loads() work...
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am tending to abandon release right now
 sonne|work	so all tests fail that serialize shogun objects
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	well we may not release this time I mean
 sonne|work	if I figure out what is wrong - I think we are in good shape for a release
 blackburn	ok, I don't mind release but I mean I hardly can find much time to fix some serialization errors
 n4nd0	if I can help with sth guys, let me know please
 sonne|work	blackburn: it is clear that I have to figure out what is wrong... - well I can try
-!- flxb [~cronor@fb.ml.tu-berlin.de] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: not so clear if you have no time for that :)
 flxb	Hello!
 flxb	Is it possible to serialize a GMNPSVM classifier? And if so, how do you do it in python_modular?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: it is not so easy - I think I have to do it this time
 sonne|work	pickle.dump(classifier)
 blackburn	yes it is possible
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: what about multiclassmachine?
 blackburn	I was lazy to implement OvO training
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has left #shogun []
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean to prepare an interface similar to LinearMachine or the like for multiclass?
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	wrong click lol
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't know if you get it before
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean to prepare an interface similar to LinearMachine or the like for multiclass?
 blackburn	n4nd0: check shogun/machine/MulticlassMachine.cpp
 blackburn	n4nd0: there is a code training machines with OvR scheme
 blackburn	so approach is similar
 blackburn	but you need to subset features instance: i.e. select only feature vectors that belongs to 2 classes you dichotomize right now
 blackburn	LibSVMMultiClass has some that kind of code
 blackburn	and MultiClassSVM class has apply for that scheme
 n4nd0	blackburn: 0vR is the same as one vs. all?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	I used to say OvR cause 'all' sounds like you try to construct hyperplane between set X and set X+Y - this makes no sense :)
 n4nd0	haha ok, I see your porint One vs. Rest
 n4nd0	point*
 n4nd0	so this 0v0 scheme is implemented in LibSVM but not in shogun?
 blackburn	I want to port all multiclass things into multiclass folder
 blackburn	GMNPSVM in fact
 blackburn	and LibSVMMulticlass as well
 blackburn	let me check how it trains
 blackburn	sonne|work: about labels I postpone it to some day after release
 blackburn	binarylabels, multiclasslabels, probabilisticlabels, etc
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok multiclass libsvm trains 1-vs-1
 n4nd0	n4nd0: all right, and that's already in shogun
 blackburn	yes, but it should change its base
 n4nd0	blackburn: how should it be?
 blackburn	I introduced MulticlassMachine
 blackburn	probably MulticlassSVM should be derived from KernelMulticlassMachine
 blackburn	and all these things should -> multiclass instead of shogun/classifier/svm
 n4nd0	blackburn: got it
 blackburn	n4nd0: but this time you probably better implement that generic thing
 blackburn	in multiclassmachine
 blackburn	do you know how 1-vs-1 works?
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is that generic thing?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no, I have just heard of 1vsR
 blackburn	both LinearMulticlassMachine and KernelMulticlassMachine can use any classifier
 blackburn	linear or kernel based accordingly
 blackburn	i.e. you may
 blackburn	LinearMulticlassMachine(ONE_VS_REST_STRATEGY, QDA(), train_features, train_labels)
 blackburn	ah yes QDA is not linera
 blackburn	then LDA()
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	so when you train it
 blackburn	it constructs 1-vs-rest linear classifiers using provided lda
 blackburn	and then classifies using these constructed hyperplanes :)
 n4nd0	I think I get the idea
 n4nd0	I guess this 1vs1 is another strategy of doing multiclass instead os 1vsR
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	take a look no train_one_vs_rest
 blackburn	imagine you've got labels [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2]
 blackburn	it constructs labels
 blackburn	[-1,-1,-1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1]
 blackburn	[+1,+1,+1,-1,-1,-1,+1,+1,+1]
 blackburn	[+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,+1,-1,-1,-1]
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	and trains provided machine using ^
 blackburn	so 3 planes separating each class from rest
 blackburn	train_one_vs_one should be a little different
 blackburn	imagine again you've got labels [0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2]
 blackburn	[-1,-1,-1,+1,+1,+1,0,0,0]
 blackburn	[-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,+1,+1,+1]
 blackburn	[0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,+1,+1,+1]
 blackburn	we should exclude vectors with 0 label
 blackburn	they are not considered by machine at all
 blackburn	got it?
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	this can be done with subsetting
 n4nd0	in a general case 1vs1 generates more separating hyperplanes right?
 blackburn	if there are K classes
 blackburn	it constructs K*(K-1)/2
 n4nd0	while the other always does K
 blackburn	OvR constructs K
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	good
 n4nd0	so the idea is first to move all the stuff to multiclass
 n4nd0	and later implement this one vs. one
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	just implement one vs one
 blackburn	in case Soeren would manage to repair serialization
 blackburn	we release, so no need to do such intrusive changes
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw there should be for i=1:K for j=i+1:K
 blackburn	little hint :)
 blackburn	i.e. no need to construct classifiers between both (0,1) and (1,0)
 blackburn	they are equal up to sign
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	good you said, I might have repeated stuff
 blackburn	for i = 1 : K
 blackburn	 for j = i + 1 : K
 n4nd0	so simplying the idea is to add two methods in MulticlassMachine
 blackburn	   mark labels == i as -1
 blackburn	   mark labels == j as +1
 blackburn	   subset feature vectors that belong to i and j classes (exclude others)
 blackburn	   train classifier, store it
 blackburn	that's THE MARVELLOUS algorithm  ;)
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes, train_one_vs_one
 blackburn	apply_one_vs_one
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	apply_one_vs_one is implemented in MultiClassSVM
 blackburn	just copy it

 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, it doesn't look like much work then (one never knows though)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes it is pretty simpel
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	I did not implement it cause I am having some research on task with 43 classes
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will try to do it and test it, comparing it to another example using 1vsR and hope to get same results
 blackburn	so damn hard to train 903 classifiers
 blackburn	applying with libsvmmulticlass takes ONE HOUR
 blackburn	thanks to wiking we've got a way to make it linear
 blackburn	now it takes 100s
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	to train*
 blackburn	and 4s to apply
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok I probably should quit irc cause it is pretty distracting and I can't start working :)
 blackburn	to get fired during this crazy pre-gsoc is not my intention :D

 hpsoar	why the 1.2.0 version can not configure with cmdline_modular?
 blackburn	cmdline_modular? there is no such interface
 wiking	yo
 blackburn	hey
 wiking	wazza man
 wiking	finally i'm work mode again
 wiking	instead of writing paper mode
 n4nd0	wiking: what was your paper about?
 wiking	n4nd0: image similarity measures
 wiking	basically extending my prev algorithms on computer vision for getting better accuracy
 wiking	nothing fancy :|
 wiking	it's one of those need-to-publish papers in my opinion

 n4nd0	let's hope it continues like this, without problems
 wiking	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	wiking: well we had some issues with branching etc, we all were new to git :D
 n4nd0	svn before?
 wiking	hahahah ah ok
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	actually there are some pitfalls
 blackburn	e.g. you may see Merge branch ... " commits
 blackburn	sometimes
 blackburn	they can be avoided with proper rebasing

-!- flxb [~cronor@g230122103.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean I have seen you fixed something
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rf081ae0 / testsuite/python_modular/tester.py : only import modshogun - http://git.io/dkMc5Q
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * raba8078 / (4 files): comment print functions in examples - http://git.io/mnNbyw
 blackburn	and again
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know whether heiko will be around?
 blackburn	sonney2k: he said this week is pretty hard
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@210.212.58.168] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 blackburn	so probably next week only
@sonney2k	I think there is some breakage in this data lock stuff / at least kernels etc are no longer set in gmnpsvm after de-serialization
 blackburn	sonney2k: row subset thing?
@sonney2k	no
-!- in3xes_ [~in3xes@59.163.196.5] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
@sonney2k	maybe related - I don't know for sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually I asked him to fix this parameters thing
@sonney2k	basically all applications are broken now
@sonney2k	but tester.py -t 1e-10 runs many examples fine now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I probably know the error - we need to add new field to parameter map
@sonney2k	so some improvements but not down to 0 errors
 blackburn	I see
-!- flxb [~cronor@g230122103.adsl.alicedsl.de] has left #shogun []
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll try to fix it but tomorrow or later

 blackburn	sonney2k: time to study signal processing! see you ;)
