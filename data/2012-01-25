@sonney2k	trees
@sonney2k	not everything but everything needed :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I totally forgot to ask - did your exam go well?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I consider shogun as 'core', but didn't formulated what is it to be core
@sonney2k	the optical illusion one I mean :D
 blackburn	yeah, got 4/5
@sonney2k	perfect
 blackburn	I am happy to get 4 for this shit hah
 blackburn	wait a min I would show you presentation
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is a nice page http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/05-%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9.pdf
 blackburn	yes, I like these guys
 blackburn	they rock
@sonney2k	sth like that for shogun would be really great for gsoc and fun for a student
 blackburn	but they dimreduction sucks haha
 blackburn	their
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh - nice :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can one memorize this?
@sonney2k	by looking it up
 blackburn	sonney2k: 28 topics totally, it is one of them
@sonney2k	if we manage to get in to say 2-3 years of gsoc we really have a wide base of all the basic features one usually needs in shogun
@sonney2k	even now I am using it for a lot of things
 blackburn	sonney2k: about sklearn dimreduction
@sonney2k	I have to sleep now!
 blackburn	I know a way (2 lines fix) how to speed up LLE
 blackburn	but didn't tell it to them yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, well their SVMs certainly are no match to shogun stuff
 blackburn	do you think it is fair? :)
@sonney2k	either
@sonney2k	as you want
@sonney2k	did they fix anything in shogun?
 blackburn	not really :)
@sonney2k	http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume12/pedregosa11a/pedregosa11a.pdf
@sonney2k	have you read?
@sonney2k	table 1 lists some experiments for very tiny data sets
 blackburn	sonney2k: glanced over, is there anything interesting?
@sonney2k	showing that shogun is slower
 blackburn	sonney2k: well did you see my measures?
@sonney2k	but that is all in the 1 second range
@sonney2k	not sure how they can mark 5.2 seconds vs. 5.63 seconds and then 5.2 secs as the clear winner
 blackburn	19.43 vs 473.34
 blackburn	seconds
 blackburn	for 10000 3d vectors
@sonney2k	why is our PCA slower?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	well it is not really optimal
 blackburn	sonney2k: what did they measure?
@sonney2k	whatever - I don't even look at data sets of size ~5000 nowadays
@sonney2k	nothing below 100k examples :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah that's funny I care too much with measures
 blackburn	trying to make them fair..
@sonney2k	I guess hardly any toolkit except shogun works for that
@sonney2k	I wonder why reviewers didn't criticize this table
@sonney2k	but hey
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay I would BLAS the PCA just now
@sonney2k	I really need to sleep now
 blackburn	or no
 blackburn	would better do the same
@sonney2k	it is blas'd IIRC?
@sonney2k	the same?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sub-mean ops could be blased too
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah, would better sleep too
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm going to submit my paper in 2 days
@sonney2k	anything that fits in memory is reasonably fast
@sonney2k	doesn't matter if it takes 1.5 or 1.0 seconds :)
@sonney2k	well I am really off now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	sonney2k: well scikits multiplies two 10000 * 10000 matrices when embedding 10000 vectors
 blackburn	(we don't) :D
 blackburn	okay see you
@sonney2k	http://packages.python.org/milk/benchmarks.html
 blackburn	so it matters sometimes
@sonney2k	look at this milk  :)
* sonney2k is typing while asleep
 blackburn	milk is pretty fast and for kmeans and SVM learning it is the fastest system.
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	LOL
 blackburn	omg lol
 blackburn	sleep well :)
