@HeikoS	wiking: lets use the current time as reference (noticed I changed it
@wiking	ok so 7pm GMT
@HeikoS	currently is 8pm London time
@wiking	that was my suggestion
@wiking	yeah i meant CET
@wiking	i.e. central eu time 8pm
@wiking	not london time :)
@HeikoS	is GMT == CMT?
@HeikoS	right now it's 7pm GMT

@wiking	The United Kingdom and its Crown dependencies use British Summer Time during the DST period. BST does not apply to British Overseas Territories, like the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar.
