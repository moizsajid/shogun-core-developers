@HeikoS	arianepaola: hi there
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi!
@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  jo
@HeikoS	So next week is the last before GSoC starts
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@host-92-0-162-192.as43234.net] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	and the current state of the project plans is not satisfying, they are not concrete enough
@HeikoS	so everyone needs to put some work into those
 leagoetz	morning everyone
@HeikoS	we dont want to be messing around how to solve problems during gsoc, this should all be done now
@HeikoS	leagoetz: hi
 leagoetz	about to write an email about this. Sunday 16 May is "Check-in", see Wiki

@HeikoS	leagoetz:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eozTFX_mgKx3eXQfQnP07Rxi8GYKfGYdu_qvGpLRnjw/edit?usp=sharing
@HeikoS	these are the docs by the students
@HeikoS	viewable for everyone
@HeikoS	(not editable I hope)
 leagoetz	Ok, I think every project should have a wiki page where these links can live
 leagoetz	will make one
@HeikoS	leagoetz: this is a good example of a concrete draft: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/New-parameters-framework-and-plugins

@wiking	arianepaola: do you know if it's possible to set the same job for N different buildslaves?
@wiking	i mean that i dont want buildbot to run the build on either on of them but on all of them
 sanuj	hello everyone
 sanuj	i got back home today
 sanuj	wiking: can i write a cookbook page on GMM?
@wiking	you have better tasks to do or?
 sanuj	we need to write one cookbook page before coding period begins
 sanuj	all gsoc students
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	but you need to have things ready for the shogun-base
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	so if i have to write a cookbook page....is gmm fine?
@wiking	sanuj: ask Heiko, he's the boss :)
 sanuj	wiking: okay :)
 sanuj	i will be giving more time to shogun now, since i'm at home....no college work to interrupt (apart from some)
 sanuj	:)
 arianepaola	wiking: it is possible to run a set of jobs across a collection of slaves, e.g. run the job for each slave in a list of slaves
 arianepaola	wiking: though there is probably an option
@wiking	arianepaola: how?
@wiking	i've prepared a packer template
@wiking	for shogun
@wiking	for fedora, centos, ubuntu, debian
@wiking	so actually now we could generate any env/image for building shogun
@wiking	i've used to generate the amis for the buildslaves
@wiking	and i have a set of steps now
@wiking	but would like to that on all those slaves
@wiking	slavenames = [...]
@wiking	will just pick 'randomly' one
 sanuj	wiking: https://gist.github.com/sanuj/56f03cd242473137fad851e68fa0f2c1
@wiking	eh
 sanuj	wiking: what sort of class diagram is heiko referring to?
@wiking	i think heiko went a bit too far
@wiking	sanuj: try to see if you can nicely grep out from (code/doxygen whatever) all the classes that are abstract
@wiking	i.e. it has at least one pure virtual function
 sanuj	wiking: okay :)
@wiking	arianepaola: how the setup.py going?
 sanuj	wiking: which irc client were you talking about?
 sanuj	now that i'm no longer behind institute http proxy...i can set it up
@wiking	sanuj: irsii
@wiking	i mean irssi
 sanuj	okay

 CaBa	hi HeikoS
@HeikoS	CaBa: hi!
 CaBa	HeikoS: saturday night hacker, ha? ;)
@HeikoS	CaBa: not really
 CaBa	HeikoS: :)
@HeikoS	just irc happens to be on ;)
 CaBa	HeikoS: damnit, then i'm alone :P
@HeikoS	usually dont use computer on weekends ;)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	what are you haching then?
 CaBa	HeikoS: oh just the usual, trying to urgently get some plots together for a talk that is due too soon :P
@HeikoS	haha I see
 CaBa	HeikoS: i removed the function name from the error message btw, travis is baking
@HeikoS	yeah that happens to me as well
@HeikoS	CaBa: great!
@HeikoS	will merge it then
 CaBa	HeikoS: thanks
@HeikoS	cool that people are using the model selection actually
@HeikoS	I have the plan to improve this
@HeikoS	but no time at the moment
 CaBa	HeikoS: well... i need to iterate through the paramters because i'm actually not fully using it ;)
@HeikoS	using x-validation though?
 CaBa	yes
 CaBa	just the gridsearch i'm kinda doing myself so it can be parallel
 CaBa	which i'm also still failing at... i'm totally new to python and there are just too many pitfalls to concurrency in python >.<
 CaBa	HeikoS: is there a way to get roc data from x-val?
@HeikoS	yeah thats better actually
@HeikoS	BUT I want to make this parallel inside shogun as well
@HeikoS	CaBa: yeah
@HeikoS	but have to write C code at the moment :)
@HeikoS	I will probably change that soon, so that it returns simply all scores
@HeikoS	not the mean
@HeikoS	CaBa: I gotta go now, have a good night, and good luck with your sat night hac ;)
 CaBa	ok, so from python i cant get a roceval object or similar after i ran x-val?
 CaBa	well in the meantime i'm close to dropping python again and do it all in cpp, so maybe i'll dig into ways to parallelize the cpp code in the end... big maybe...
 CaBa	i guess since you haven't done it already it won't be a 2-day project ;)
@HeikoS	it is planned for gsoc
 CaBa	HeikoS: have a good night, too
 CaBa	oh, this year?
@HeikoS	so in 3 months parallel xval should be there
@HeikoS	and we can update the interface to return all scores on the fly
 CaBa	\o/
 CaBa	neat
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	ask Saurabh7 about it
@HeikoS	he is doing it
 CaBa	parallel gridsearch?
@HeikoS	xvalidation
@HeikoS	that is enough
@HeikoS	grid-search can be serial if x-val is parallel
 CaBa	so num_runs with be parallel?
@HeikoS	yeah or even the folds
 CaBa	folds would be great
@HeikoS	we need to sort out some things for that though
@HeikoS	to allow for shared data
@HeikoS	obviously dont want to duplicate

@HeikoS	no worries that was broken before

 CaBa	HeikoS: in python things don't even work straight forward with duplicating everything and using multiprocessing - was quite frustrating :P seems like shogun objects aren't particularly picklable :P
@HeikoS	CaBa: yeah I know, python multicore is a desaster
@HeikoS	easier if we do it
@HeikoS	maybe its running in a few weeks
@HeikoS	I often run a scirpt with different parameters multiple times atm
 CaBa	well i learned my lession. re-declared python as 'only use for small hacks and never for big projects' :P
 CaBa	well that's not only memory duplication, that's also i/o and overhead duplication ;)
