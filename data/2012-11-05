 wiking	heheh that was a fast clikc ;)
 blackburn	not so fast
 blackburn	I'll work on this, we need to get response time to 2 seconds!
 blackburn	to build communism
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	wiking: when scikits takes 9.24s, my shit takes 1.46s
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	just measured
 wiking	sweet
 wiking	u do svd?
 blackburn	well it is LTSA
 blackburn	alignment of PCA of each local path
 blackburn	constructing principal manifold
 blackburn	svd is here in one step in general, yet
 blackburn	yes*
 wiking	cool
 blackburn	but final embedding is done via eigendecomposition
 blackburn	with smallest eigenvectors
 wiking	yeps
 wiking	but you do eigen vector/value calculation
 blackburn	I use LDLT and Arpack for that
 wiking	just because a friend of mine need one that can do that really fast
 blackburn	I am eigenexpert
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	if he needs only a few eigenvectors I know good library - arpack :)
 blackburn	with 50000 vectors
 blackburn	scikits 46.9
 blackburn	my thing 4.74
 blackburn	http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/e/e6/Okay_guy.jpg
 wiking	blackburn: naaa he has huge matrices
 blackburn	wiking: symmetric?
 wiking	afaik yes but i gotta ask him
 blackburn	sparse?
 blackburn	all eigenvectors?
 wiking	yes he needs all of them
 blackburn	all eigenvectors of huge matrix? http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/e/e6/Okay_guy.jpg
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	full eigendecomposition is tough
 blackburn	is it sparse at least?
 wiking	dunno
 wiking	gotta ask him
 wiking	but i know that he needs it for his simulations
 blackburn	the only way to handle big dense matrices is parallelization and/or distribution I believe
 wiking	yeah i think he is planning to use a nvidia tesla for his problem :P
 wiking	hehehe blackburn who's gonna implement t-SNE in shogun?
 blackburn	wiking: I am going to but not in shogun :D
 wiking	y not?
 blackburn	I am preparing a toolkit for such stuff here you know
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	i c
 blackburn	wiking: actually sometimes i think I made a carpet generator
 blackburn	wiking: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/carpet.png
 blackburn	200000 points :D
 wiking	heheh
 blackburn	wiking: shogun's serialization framework http://ubuntuone.com/3Evo6s561El0wagE3TV6SK
 wiking	lol
 wiking	mmm i should check how i can segment with svm :)
 blackburn	I can haz segments wiz da svm

 KMcQuisten	Hey there all
 wiking	hey
 KMcQuisten	So after compiling the most recent code (That I pulled this morning)  I cannot import anything into python.  No matter what object I try to import, I get the following error:
 KMcQuisten	 ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/_modshogun.so: undefined symbol: _ZTIN6shogun20CDirectorLatentModelE
 wiking	mmmmm
 KMcQuisten	Even when I'm not using any code related to LatenSVM
 blackburn	huhu
 wiking	KMcQuisten: the latent model unfortunately you wont be able to use from python at this moment
 blackburn	someone forgot to safe his code if #ifdef USE_SWIG_DIRECTORS wiking :D
 KMcQuisten	I don't want to use the latent model.  The inclusion of the laten model has broken the whole damn codebase
 wiking	KMcQuisten: but it's thrilling that you are trying to use latentsvm :P may i ask what's the problem for which you'd like to use it
 KMcQuisten	I'm not using it wiking.
 wiking	KMcQuisten: ah ok
 wiking	KMcQuisten: let me check
 wiking	blackburn: i'm pretty sure i did that
 wiking	lemme check
 blackburn	hmm you did
 wiking	KMcQuisten: it's happening with any of the python code?
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  I tried to import RealFeatures from shogun.Features, and it craps out with the above erroe message.
 wiking	KMcQuisten: mmmm
 wiking	blackburn: any ideas? :)
 KMcQuisten	Every object I've tried has given me this error
 wiking	KMcQuisten: can u give me your ./configure command line?
 blackburn	wiking: ehmm not really
 KMcQuisten	./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-swig-directors --interaces=python_modular
 KMcQuisten	interfaces
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	so directors were enabled
 KMcQuisten	Yes. I need the for DirectorKernels
-!- cwidmer [8295586d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.130.149.88.109] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 KMcQuisten	I have swig 2.0.8
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: did you try to recompile?
 KMcQuisten	Yes I did.
 blackburn	ahamm
 KMcQuisten	completely cleaned and build form scratch
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: okay I have to compile and check
 KMcQuisten	Allrighty
 KMcQuisten	make -j 2
 KMcQuisten	oops, wrong window ;)
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	haha wrong language
 blackburn	okay we are all wrong

-!- zxtx [~zv@173-13-183-134-sfba.hfc.comcastbusiness.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: it actually works here..
 blackburn	the only difference is that I am using python2.7
 blackburn	but it seems to be strange anyway
 KMcQuisten	I'm backing up a few commits to see if that fixes things on my machine.  I'm using 2.6.6 here
