@iglesiasg	what about you?
@iglesiasg	sure, let me have a look
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I'm fine. working.
@iglesiasg	gsomix, why do you need to use \ at the end of some lines_
@iglesiasg	?
 gsomix	iglesiasg, multiline macro definition
@iglesiasg	gsomix, aham, I see
@iglesiasg	gsomix, what about 131 in CSVFile.cpp
@iglesiasg	maybe it is a macro too and I missing it
 gsomix	nope
 gsomix	just typo
@iglesiasg	all right
@iglesiasg	remove the braces in that one-line for on the way too, please

@sonney2k	van51, hey there! all good?
@sonney2k	gsomix, any news on the string reader btw?
 gsomix	sonney2k, preparing PR.
 gsomix	sonney2k, good evening
 gsomix	sonney2k, I found interesting thing. we can implement it in future. http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/3479/The-Bip-Buffer-The-Circular-Buffer-with-a-Twist
@sonney2k	wiking, how do I get cmake for osx?
 van51	sonney2k: hey
 van51	sonney2k: I've been procrastinating a lot this week :/ and I'm trying to get back on track
 van51	sonney2k: so I started looking into the lbbpyr feats
 van51	lbppyr*
 van51	sonney2k: If i'm not mistaken it's missing support for windows, right?
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah well for the future but for now I need the csv reader to work and then we can get rid of ascii file do some refactoring and then we need protobuf and matlab file support
 van51	sonney2k: also, did vojtech reply to you?
@sonney2k	van51, shogun you mean? well cygwin
@sonney2k	van51, yes long time ago
@sonney2k	afk
 van51	sonney2k: no I'm talking about that lbppyr method
 van51	sonney2k: his file, liblbp.c, is ported as is into the CLBPPyrFeatures
 van51	sonney2k: what is extra in the file that you had shown me,  lbppyr_features_mex.c, is support for defined windows on the images
 van51	I think
 van51	sonney2k: he didn't do reply all.. did he give training data and the model?
 van51	sonney2k: if useful, could you forward his email to me?
@sonney2k	van51, ok sent the email
@sonney2k	van51, no that is not a windows but a matlab interface file
 van51	sonney2k: yeah I meant that the extra is to seperate the images on predefined windows
 van51	I'm not talking about the OS :)
@sonney2k	van51, ahh ok
@sonney2k	van51, yeah I think it is sufficient to assume that the box around the face is given
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw we don't need CAsciiFile now, rigth?

@sonney2k	gsomix, well if you have string reading implemented and sparse / dense then csvfile will take over
@sonney2k	gsomix, so yes?
@sonney2k	van51, IMHO it would be good to have the text document example finished and some nice table / plot for webspam (with the old string kernel and new one)
@sonney2k	van51, then the language detection with full documents and shorter sentences
@sonney2k	van51, and of course I would be happy if you could continue with the other dot feature stuff (random kitchen sinks etc from quoc) and the gender recognition example from vojtech
 van51	sonney2k: what do you mean by text document example?
@sonney2k	van51, what do you think is reasonable / what would you want to do
@sonney2k	van51, the language detection
 van51	sonney2k: ah. well it remains to be ported into python and converted to a demo possibly
 van51	sonney2k: I wanted to have results by today on small sentences, but when I'm evaluating on a de-serialized svm I'm getting again some segfaults
 van51	that I didn't when I had called apply before
 van51	sonney2k: I would like to do for sure the random kitchen sinks and the fast food
@sonney2k	van51, it would be very cool if you would stay around post gsoc and continue all this...

@sonney2k	ohh man they changed the buildbot website http://buildbot.net/index.html
@sonney2k	now I can no longer find the download links
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	osx? then install buildbot via macports
@wiking	or homebrow
@wiking	*homebrew
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah I am fighting with osx for some time now
@sonney2k	wiking, the macbook air I have for testing has 4g memory so just sufficient as a buildbot
@wiking	https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/archive/v0.8.7p1.tar.gz
@wiking	sonney2k: what version?
@sonney2k	wiking, do I need to install anything from brew?
@sonney2k	some old one from 2011
@wiking	sonney2k: buildbot-slave
@wiking	sonney2k:  in macports
@wiking	so maaaybe that's a better option
@wiking	as it really only installs the slave
@wiking	Library Dependencies: python27, py27-twisted
@wiking	so it'll install python2.7...
@wiking	but that's no biggy
@wiking	as it's really just a binary package for sure
@wiking	sonney2k: :( http://braumeister.org/search/buildbot
@wiking	no result
@wiking	so i guess macports is really the better option
@sonney2k	wiking, I rather install it from source then
@sonney2k	wiking, I am no fan of macports. too experimental
@wiking	heheh i likeit i use it :P
@wiking	but then just install py27-twisted
@wiking	i mean tisted from src
@wiking	and u r good
 lisitsyn	I am kind of rewriting INSTALL
@wiking	\o/
@sonney2k	wiking, do we really need cmake 3.8? seems like a couple of systems only have 3.6
@sonney2k	wiking, apart from that I guess you have seen that we are in kaboom state http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	since I switched all to cmake
 lisitsyn	I tihnk 3.6 is ok
@wiking	you mean 2.8
@wiking	yeah i think ExternalProject_Add is really only since 2.8
@wiking	and couple of other features
 lisitsyn	wiking: really?
