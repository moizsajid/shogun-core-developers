 CaBa	hi
 CaBa	wiking: ping
@wiking	pong
 CaBa	wiking: what's up?
@wiking	notmuch
 CaBa	it's so calm here recently
@wiking	waiting for a fix
@wiking	to be able to release 5.0.1
 CaBa	wiking: can i ask an honest question? ^^
@wiking	yes
 CaBa	wiking: what's going on with the lib right now? what's the focus of the current development?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	there's this
 CaBa	wiking: i have the feeling that there are large zombie areas within the lib that nobody knows / touches / wants to touch
@wiking	:)))0
@wiking	it's more like prios
@wiking	big here's the big picture
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC-2016-summit-discussion
 CaBa	i see...
 CaBa	wiking: i have to admit, sometimes i miss the "fix all bugs and document all classes and functions before going any further" bulletpoint :)))
@wiking	:>
@wiking	well trying to fix soem stuff
@wiking	but so far we can go with doing this
@wiking	as just a hobby
@wiking	i have like 2-3 branches
@wiking	'almost done'
@wiking	those are stability fixes
@wiking	but then again
@wiking	i dont have time to finish them
 CaBa	i know, manpower-wise it is super tight... the gsoc thing is great, but i guess also not enough to maintain and run an entire library of that size

@wiking	indeed
 CaBa	wiking: you aren't too familiar with the string kernel implementations in shogun, right?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	i can help debug
@wiking	but no not by heart
 CaBa	no bug (i guess)
 CaBa	i'm just wondering how one can overcome that 'k' is not a parameter of the kernel in CommWordStringKernel
 CaBa	it has to be decided during feature generation
 CaBa	i wonder if there is nevertheless a way to integrate it into model selection
 CaBa	or if i should spend the time to build a wrapper kernel that takes StringFeatures<char> and builds the StringFeatures<int> on the fly when 'k' is changed...
 zero1hac	Hey, sorry to interrupt,  in the channel's welcome  message I guess link to Channel logs is incorrect. Shouldn't it be http://bit.ly/2h9BDNr ?

 CaBa	wiking: is that whole stringfeature logic explained anywhere? as in - what's behind all that "obtain_from_char" conversion, what's the "order" of string features, etc etc?
@wiking	not that i know of
-!- praisethemoon_ is now known as praisethemoon
 CaBa	wiking: do you know what's behind obtaining a StringFeatures<uint16_t> from a StringFeatures<char>? What's the generel idea behind that?
@wiking	mmm utf
@wiking	?
 CaBa	nope
@wiking	uint8 = char
 CaBa	can exclude any multibyte encoding intentions behind that
 CaBa	wiking: the conversion among other things calls CAlphabet::remap_to_bin()

 CaBa	wiking: apparently it stores words in single 16 or 64 bit types
-!- zero1hac [~zerooneha@139.59.16.180] has joined #shogun
 CaBa	wiking: is there any harm in calling init(l,r) multiple times, i.e. with different features?
