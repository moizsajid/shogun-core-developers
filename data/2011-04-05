 siddharth_	hi sonney2k
@bettyboo	ho
@sonney2k	siddharth_, morning.
 siddharth_	well I asked the author of that Matlab toolbox
 siddharth_	and he said that its fine as long as you use this for open software
 siddharth_	sonney2k, so should I go for two proposals ... One for the Newton Primal SVM solver and other one for Dim Reduction?
* siddharth_ wondering how busy sonney2k must be :P

 Tanmoy	@sonney2k do we have to add some more classes to the preprocessing base class
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k well not actually maybe to CPreProc but maybe to CSimplePreProc
@sonney2k	siddharth_, sorry was haiving breakfast... you had the idea about all these different dim reduction methods that you found in some matlab toolbox right?
@sonney2k	Tanmoy, totally up to you
@sonney2k	if you think you can define some preprocs that share a good subset of features (e.g. all use a kernel in some way and have the same kind of apply() function) then it makes totally sense
@sonney2k	siddharth_, just see your email. yes, makes perfectly sense. I tend to even say that the dim reduction techniques open up a new field inside shogun - so I would even consider this proposal to be stronger
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@46.18.27.35] has joined #shogun
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k well the reason after scanning thru wat i felt is because the sparsity DS which u have defined is strong
 Tanmoy	but got Sparse Regression i don't know how strong it could be
 Tanmoy	so i have defined some of my own proc
 Tanmoy	wld discuss with chris too and add it to the proposal
@sonney2k	Tanmoy, well one could of course write two preprocs one for sparse and one for dense features... not sure how much functionality they can exchange...
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k at this stage dense would not really be a probs i think what you have is good enough
 Tanmoy	i have talked to chris of doing some work after GSOC so shld be good enough
 Tanmoy	to do it then
 Tanmoy	ill also be in saarnucken so hope to ctch u guys thr
 Tanmoy	btw im kinda dissapoointed tht the mentors for strcutrued learning are kinda absent
 Tanmoy	is tht project going on or stopped ?
@sonney2k	Tanmoy, hmmhh both of them?
@sonney2k	I now that Nico is or has just returned form a conference in Vancouver
 Tanmoy	well Jonas did reply
 Tanmoy	nico not yet
 Tanmoy	thrs even hardly any time to discuss
@sonney2k	well that explains it then?
 Tanmoy	yeah but was a good proposal
 Tanmoy	i mean u have kernel learning in shogun
@sonney2k	hmhhh, I will see Nico today in person so ask him now
 Tanmoy	but structured learning in kernels and CRF's wld be very neat
@sonney2k	so he will then respond later in the day...
 Tanmoy	:) gr8 sounds fair
 Tanmoy	btw anything in SHOGUN right now for MAP estimation
 Tanmoy	i mean any class defined for Prob distributions
 siddharth_	sonney2k, Well I will give 2 proposals and whichever you select will be fine by me :)
@sonney2k	siddharth_, heh

 Ziyuan	"lib/common.h" includes a header file "lib/config.h" while there's no such a file.
 aifargonos	it is generated automatically ... build first
 aifargonos	or maybe I am wrong ??
 aifargonos	no ... class_list in base is generated automatically ... sorry for confusion ..
-!- hiteshk [~hitesh_na@117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun
 Ziyuan	wait...
@sonney2k	yes class_list.cpp is generated using class_list*template* and the script that does it is the class_list.cpp.py
@sonney2k	this is necessary for us to get a mapping class name -> class
@sonney2k	(for serialization)
 aifargonos	btw, sonney2k: all this source files with *Serializable* in their name are used for serialization ... But what are other sources with *File* in their name used for ??
 aifargonos	like AsciiFile, HDF5File or even SimpleFile ??
@sonney2k	aifargonos, just plain matrix / vector / string i/o, e.g. read a list of strings (for shogun's string features) or a matrix (for shoguns simplefeatures)
 aifargonos	yeah .: I understood the code, but where are they used ?? Are they used inside shogun, or are they just for users ??
@sonney2k	aifargonos, inside of shogun of course
@sonney2k	but shogun methods only use the interface class CFIle
 aifargonos	Where in shogun can I find examples of their usage ??
@sonney2k	e.g. in CSimpleFeatures, CStringFeatures, CSparseFeatures

 Ziyuan	But there are many of them...
 Ziyuan	And snappy?

@sonney2k	Tanmoy, no... btw nico is just reading your email...
@sonney2k	Ziyuan, I think the serial one is enough
@sonney2k	Ziyuan, snappy is just for some fast compression...
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k gr8 and thnks
 Tanmoy	also u think for GP a binary and multi class demo with Toy data is reasonable
 Tanmoy	or data should be from bio informatics domain

 Ziyuan	Toy code fails to run: I've run a build for libshogun (configure -> make -> make install) which generated libshogun.so and libshogun.a. And then I set up another tentative project in Eclipse, adding the include paths ("/.../src/libshogun") and libraries paths ("/.../src/libshogun/libshogun.so" and ".../libshogun.a"). But Eclipse complains that it cannot find the two libraries. So what steps do
 Ziyuan	I need to have the code run normally?
 Ziyuan	It must be easy...
 Ziyuan	My code is an simple init-and-exit pair, the same as what is in README.developer.
 Ziyuan	sonney2k, yes, so I've ignore snappy.
 Ziyuan	The console output:
 Ziyuan	Building target: HelloShogun

 lionelc_	hi Shogun developers,  there is a compilation error when being installed on MacOS:
 lionelc_	cpp.o structure/SegmentLoss.cpp generating base/class_list.cpp from base/class_list.cpp.templ by running base/class_list.cpp.sh sed: 2: "s/^[ \t^t\/\*]*class \+ ...": RE error: parentheses not balanced
 lionelc_	I think it is caused by the version of compiler. is it so?
