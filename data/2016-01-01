@besser82	sonney2k, You're in Treptow for work, rye?
@sonney2k	besser82, yeah in the tower of treptow(tm)
@besser82	sonney2k, any idea how to get there from Charlottenburg in reasonable time?
@besser82	sonney2k, subway and tram take ~ 55 mins. to go there
@sonney2k	besser82, where are you exactly?
@besser82	sonney2k, Wilmersdorfer Strasse 25
@besser82	sonney2k, so Staatsoper / Bismarkstrasse is nearby
@sonney2k	besser82, well we could meet e.g at alexanderplatz which is kind of half-way
@besser82	sonney2k, That sounds like a plan
@besser82	sonney2k, The other option would be Neu-K?lln Arcaden / Rathaus
@besser82	There's a nice Pakistanian Restaurant about 3 mins away
@sonney2k	besser82, sounds even better then :)
