 yalcinm	hello iglesiasg
 yalcinm	hello iglesiasg, are you there now?
 yalcinm	can you help me to install python-modular with Cygwin64 Terminal
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: hey, yep here I am
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: mm I have no idea about cygwin, weren't you using ubuntu?
 yalcinm	yes, I'm using ubuntu on vmware / windows 8
 yalcinm	I taught cygwin might be easier
 yalcinm	ok
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: ubuntu should be easiest
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: all right, so you did a git clone of shogun somewhere, right?
 yalcinm	yes
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
 yalcinm	lets make it clear, you mean if I have latest shogun files on my computer right?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 yalcinm	..
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: well, I put it as clear as possible :-)
 yalcinm	..
@iglesiasg	did you do
 yalcinm	yes
@iglesiasg	git clone <repository where shogun is>
@iglesiasg	it can be the main shogun repo, or a fork you may have done in github
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository. What I am asking you about corresponds to the part under "clining an existing repository"
@iglesiasg	cloning*
 yalcinm	clone in desktop button you mean :)
@iglesiasg	not really
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 yalcinm	$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
 yalcinm	will I type this in the ubuntu terminal?
@iglesiasg	you should substitute that url by the one corresponding to Shogun's repository
 yalcinm	of cource, ok
@iglesiasg	which you can find here: github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
@iglesiasg	you may have your own fork of that though, and prefer to use that one. If you don't know what a fork is, never mind for the moment and read about it later
 yalcinm	ok
 yalcinm	git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 yalcinm	ok I made it
 yalcinm	shogun is cloned
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: now?
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: I understand you already installed the packages that Esben mentioned: github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2617#issuecomment-63066913
 yalcinm	yes
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: thus, you should be ready to follow github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART#compile-and-install-shogun-toolbox-into-home-directory
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	substitut shogun-3.1.1 by the name of the directory created by git clone
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: include the -DPythonModular=ON if you want so (or any other interface for that matter)
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 yalcinm	is this enough?
 yalcinm	I will create a directory named build then I will use this command
 yalcinm	right?
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: ?
@iglesiasg	I think you should be good to go like that, yes
@iglesiasg	mkdir build
@iglesiasg	cd build
 yalcinm	yes
@iglesiasg	cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 yalcinm	what is isfinite
@iglesiasg	a function
 yalcinm	I remember that last time I cmake, it was saying it is not found
 yalcinm	how can I install it
@iglesiasg	shold be fine
 yalcinm	there is no need to install it?
@iglesiasg	copy somewhere the output of cmake and let me see it if you are unsure whether it went all right
 yalcinm	ok
@iglesiasg	with somehwere I mean either gist or pastebin

 yalcinm	iglesiasg: this is the result
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: is it okay?
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: it seems you don't have swig installed
@iglesiasg	not python either...
@iglesiasg	well, python libraries
@iglesiasg	I am copy+pasting from the quickstart, look
@iglesiasg	Depending on the enabled interfaces you may need: swig 2, r-base-dev, liboctave-dev, openjdk-6-jdk/openjdk-7-jdk, jblas, jblas-dev, python2.7-dev, python-numpy
@iglesiasg	since you have done PythonModular=ON
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: I have it,
 yalcinm	user@ubuntuvm:~/shogun/build$ sudo apt-get install swig2.0 Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done swig2.0 is already the newest version. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
@iglesiasg	that means you need swig 2 (swig is the program we use so that our C++ code can be used from e.g. Python, Java, Lua, etc), python2.7-dev, python-numpy
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: when type sudo apt-get install swig2.0
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: what?
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: when type sudo apt-get install swig2.0
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: it says swig2.0 is already the newest version.
@iglesiasg	can you execute swig.20 from your terminal?
@iglesiasg	just to check that it is properly installed and visible in your path

-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 yalcinm	how can I check it?
 yalcinm	what should I type in the terminal?
@iglesiasg	swig2.0
@iglesiasg	and press enter
 yalcinm	swig2.0
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: it says "Must specify an input file. Use -help for available options."
@iglesiasg	good sign
@iglesiasg	all right

@iglesiasg	mkdir build
@iglesiasg	cd build
@iglesiasg	cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
@iglesiasg	but install the other python packages I told you about before, please
@iglesiasg	the ones mentioned in the quickstart
 yalcinm	ok
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: sudo apt-get install cmake gcc g++ clang  ldd wget curl tar bzip2 bash grep test sed cut awk ldd uname cat python-2.7

@iglesiasg	yalcinm: the package that contains ldd is not called ldd

 yalcinm	iglesiasg: what about E: Unable to locate package python-2.7-dev E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'python-2.7-dev'
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: that I spelled it wrong, it is python2.7-dev
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: Package lapack3-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source  E: Package 'lapack3-dev' has no installation candidate
@iglesiasg	for these things, it is useful to use apt-cache search <terms to search for>
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: before installing lapack (or any other optinal dependency for that matter), I'd think if I need it
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: what do you want use Shogun for? Does that part you want it for depend on lapack?
 yalcinm	I'm trying to install them because they are stated in the quickstart

@iglesiasg	Optional libraries to improve performance: lapack3-dev, atlas3-headers, atlas3-base-dev, libeigen3-dev
 yalcinm	I will use shogun for mutiple kernel learning iglesiasg
 yalcinm	yes
@iglesiasg	**optional**
@iglesiasg	anyway, never mind
 yalcinm	ok
 yalcinm	:)) I want it to work this time
 yalcinm	iglesiasg:
@iglesiasg	the lapack3-dev package thing can be because the package name has changed, it is called in a different way in yor distro, whatever other reason
 yalcinm	ok should I continue with cmake ....
@iglesiasg	apt-cache search lapack-dev gives me liblapack-dev
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: in any case, if you look at your cmake log, the one you pasted before, you can see that lapack is under libraries found
@iglesiasg	which makes me wonder why are you still concerned about installing it
 yalcinm	sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev is also installed
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: should I continue to cmake process no?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: yeah, try again and see if cmake is happy with everything (swig, python complaints that appeared before)

@iglesiasg	rm -rf build
@iglesiasg	mkdir build && cd build
@iglesiasg	etc

@iglesiasg	yalcinm: it looks good to me now
@iglesiasg	yalcinm: what is the output of nproc?
 yalcinm	what is nproc?
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: output is 1
@iglesiasg	do nproc in your terminal to see the number of processors
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: output is 1
@iglesiasg	all right, then just type make
 yalcinm	make -j5 all
 yalcinm	?
 yalcinm	or just make?
@iglesiasg	-j5 determines that make should be run using 5 jobs in parallel, since your machine seems to have only one processor, make is just fine
@iglesiasg	make and make all should do pretty much the same (maybe? :D
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: ok
 yalcinm	after this? make install iglesiasg

 yalcinm	iglesiasg: after this? will I do "make install"
 yalcinm	?
@iglesiasg	let's see how this one goes first
@iglesiasg	but yeah, as the quickstart says
 yalcinm	it's very slow
 yalcinm	it's %2
 yalcinm	and the time here, is 5:31 AM
 yalcinm	shogun took all of my day and night
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: so I will leave it, and go to sleep now
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: how will I know if it is okay or not after make finishes?
@iglesiasg	if there's been no error
 yalcinm	ok
 yalcinm	iglesiasg: thank you very much, I will let you know on github issue page
 yalcinm	have a nice day
@iglesiasg	Cool. Thank you. You too
@iglesiasg	Have a nice sleep :)
