 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #3370 from sanuj/plugins
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add plugins functionality
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and if you would like to look at the tags readme
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3414
 sanuj	i'm writing readme for plugins
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how exactly will parameters help with plugins?
 sanuj	you wrote in your design draft
 sanuj	"The parameters thing enables us to implement plugins seamlessly because we don't have to export all class interfaces explicitly"
 sanuj	lisitsyn, does this mean that plugins would not bother much with SWIG?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: plugins are runtime
 lisitsyn	parameters are the only runtime way as well
 lisitsyn	old way like get_something is compiled into our library
 lisitsyn	so it can't be runtime
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i don't fully understand
 sanuj	you mean Parameter.h would create problems for runtime plugins?
 lisitsyn	no idea about parameter.h
 lisitsyn	I mean if you have compiled interfaces you can't get runtime behaviour
 sanuj	the new parameter is also compiled
 sanuj	parameter framework
 sanuj	oh
 lisitsyn	there is nothing about concrete parameters in the new one
 sanuj	you mean more parameters can be added at runtime
 sanuj	they are not fixed in compile time
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so you will merge feature/tags in develop after SG_ADD workss?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah probably
 lisitsyn	sanuj: actually you have a fix for SG_ADD
 lisitsyn	I just need to drop equals thing again
 lisitsyn	and use your sfinae trick
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	sfinae was rather tricky
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what is next for plugins?
 sanuj	you can tell me anytime if you have any ideas
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I think it would make sense to start converting some concrete thing
 lisitsyn	we will get some problems I guess
 lisitsyn	then gradually fix it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, take something from shogun and make a plugin out of it
 sanuj	?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeap
 sanuj	lisitsyn, will plugins be different repos?
 sanuj	we need to think about structuring of plugins also
 lisitsyn	sanuj: not sure but probably yes
 sanuj	where shall i keep the  first plugin we make?
 sanuj	and which class shall i pick up?
 sanuj	i think some class which is closest to SGObject
 sanuj	in the parent hierarchy
 sanuj	CMath
 sanuj	but it's huge
 lisitsyn	I think some classifier or something
 sanuj	2400 lines of code
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, lda?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: an
 lisitsyn	any
 sanuj	do we forward declare CDenseFeatures, SGMatrix etc
 sanuj	in the plugin?
 sanuj	oh or just include
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so CLinearMachine is the parent class of LDA
 sanuj	do i need to pluginize CLinearMachine as well?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: linear machine is definitely a base class :)
 sanuj	alright
 sanuj	just confirming things
