 wiking	ah report day!
 n4nd0	yeah \o/
 wiking	btw: currently shogun will not compile at all w/o lapack support
 wiking	i've just tried it on a simple machine to clone my repo and test some stuff there and i've realized this..

 eric____	hi again
 eric____	I would like to test smthg: compute the spectrum kernel from strings (i have CStrginFeatures<uint16_t>) with CommWordString kernel
 eric____	whats the function to use (preproc?) which compute the k-mer frequ feature vector ?
 eric____	following the doc, CommWordString use SortWordString preproc
 eric____	and it says : "For this to work the strings have to be mapped into  * a binary higher order representation first (cf. obtain_from_*() functions in  * CStringFeatures)"
 eric____	what exaclty does obtain_from_features ? It send me an error about num_symbols ..

 heiko	me :)
-!- emrecelikten [~Anubis@176.40.238.218] has joined #shogun
 eric____	heiko: :)
 eric____	heiko: could you help me to run CommWordString kernel ?
 heiko	eric, maybe whats the problem with it?
 eric____	I would like to know how to compute the ?-mer spectrum kernel fro example
 eric____	2-mer
 eric____	(i have CStrginFeatures<uint16_t>
 eric____	docs advise to run preprocess SortWordString which just sort the string
 eric____	I am wondering where is the function which compute the 2-mer frequency feature vector ??
 heiko	I am not really into that stuff, however, lets see
 heiko	so you just want to use this common word kernel?
 heiko	have you tried the example for it?
 heiko	why do you want to compute a feature vector?
 eric____	lets explain what I have understand
 eric____	for now my samples are stringfeatures: string list of uint16_t
 eric____	I would like to compute a spectrum kernel of 2-mer
 heiko	ok
 eric____	and as the docs says : in this feature vector each entry denotes how often the k-mer appears in that string
 eric____	so there is some preproc to do I think
 heiko	where is that written in the doc?
 heiko	could you send a link so that I can see the context?
 eric____	I have seen obtain_from_features method in CStringFeatures but I dont know how to use it .
 eric____	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CWeightedCommWordStringKernel.html
 eric____	or http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CCommWordStringKernel.html for simple k fixed version
 heiko	ok
 heiko	first: you usually dont compute fetaure vectors directly, this is just implicitly. If you *would* compute feature vectors, they had this described structure
 heiko	imagine you use 10-mers over an alphabet with 10 letters
 heiko	thats 10^10 dimensions
 heiko	this sorting just means, that in order to use these weights, you would have to sort the data that you attach to the kernel

 heiko	the obtain_from_* methods are just to convert string features/char features to numerical representations
 heiko	I would suggest to make the example run and then experiment a bit with it
 K0stIa	hi all, I have problem with installing shogun from github code. I'm doing ./configure and then make. And my make fails, it says
 K0stIa	statistics/QuadraticTimeMMD.cpp:164:34: error: 'compute_eigenvectors' is not a member of 'shogun::SGMatrix<double>'
 K0stIa	can anyone say smth about it ?
 heiko	Hi K0stIa
 heiko	yes, I will have a look, just a second

 heiko	K0stIa, are you using the current git ?
 heiko	when did you clone/update last?
 heiko	ah I think I know whats wrong ...
 heiko	you can fix that by installing lapack libraries but I will also add a fix
 CIA-18	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * r27f5fd1 / (2 files): added lapack check for eigenspectrum based test to solve compile error - http://git.io/C5xsmQ

 blackburn	heiko: one trick - you may pull from fork w/o pull request
 heiko	blackburn, ok, how? :)
 blackburn	ah you have no clone of shogun
 blackburn	then no way :)
 heiko	no :)
 heiko	If it annoys you I can do that
 blackburn	noo
 blackburn	I just mean would be faster probably
 blackburn	for you
 blackburn	3 more reports to go
 heiko	reports?
 heiko	the way I am doing it is also fast :) I always get confused if there is too much stuff
 heiko	ah weekly
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am doing my soon, I promise :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am leaving my repo clean of new code first
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	I have seen you get multiclass example to work alreadY?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah!
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have to use bigger datasets though
 n4nd0	Nico told me that the evaluation license of MOSEK has an expiration date
 n4nd0	so I could just solve very small problems
 blackburn	baad
 n4nd0	but if I get a new one I will be able to solve big ones
 blackburn	is there any chance to use that bmrm stuff?
 blackburn	I am not into SO actually you know :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: to use it for what do you mean?
 blackburn	instead of mosek
 n4nd0	blackburn: ah ok
 n4nd0	they are different things
 n4nd0	so we use mosek for the optimization algorithm
 n4nd0	bmrm is the training algorithm
 n4nd0	it relies in a optimizer as well
 n4nd0	but it is a different one and for bmrm libqp is enough
 n4nd0	at least I think it is like this, I'm not 100% sure
 blackburn	aham

@sonney2k	n4nd0, so what was the issue? what did you have to change to get it to work?
@sonney2k	heiko, thanks for the fix
@sonney2k	heiko, I guess you have seen that I reworked CStatistics/CMath/SGVector/SGMatrix...
@sonney2k	I think it is much better now
 heiko	yes, my examples broke :)
 heiko	I agree
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the issue I wanted to tell you about is related to modular interface, I cannot make work my SO there
 heiko	much nicer
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but I have not fixed it yet
@sonney2k	heiko, ahh and please keep the scheme w/ doing pull requests and then merges
@sonney2k	I think I should do the same
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I did the example in libshogun interface
 heiko	sonney2k, well, ok :) it feels more comfortable for me anyway
 heiko	and this way I dont break the main repo
 heiko	(which I sometimes manage to do with my fork :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so waht is the issue w/ modulear here?
 blackburn	is BFGS any cool for svms?
 blackburn	any evidences?
@sonney2k	the buildbot is back to live
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, you rock!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I got positive feedback wrt mosek btw
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what feedback?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: about modular
 n4nd0	sonney2k: TypeError: in method 'StructuredOutputMachine_set_model', argument 2 of type 'CStructuredModel *'
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that we will get licenses
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I get errors like this
 blackburn	n4nd0: didn't you fix that?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it seems that it doesn't recognize the inheritance properly
 n4nd0	blackburn: no :O
 blackburn	okay lets try to get rid of it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that is easily fixed - just put a class CStructuredModel; in the header
 n4nd0	blackburn: the last we said about it was ... we'll ask sonney2k
 blackburn	yes I recall
 blackburn	iirc it ^ didn't helped?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I tried with that, blackburn told me about it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that will help
 n4nd0	but it didn't make the trick
 n4nd0	I'll try again then
@sonney2k	it will
@sonney2k	if not show me the changed header
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, give me some minutes, I have just rebased and I have to adapt the changes done in CMath
@sonney2k	for some reason swig forgets that we are in shogun:: namespace if we don't add that everywhere :(
 blackburn	inheritance problems emerge essentially when you have wrong order of includes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, k
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is not an inheritance problem here
 blackburn	some kind of
 blackburn	however yes rather polymorphism :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, today I got the galaxy s3
@sonney2k	only to realize that it needs a micro sim card
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	so I had to cut my sim card with a scissors
 blackburn	however I still prefer my robust phone
 n4nd0	seriously?
 n4nd0	the scissors thing
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	it works
 n4nd0	hahaha
 blackburn	why not
 n4nd0	c'mon, it sounds funny
@sonney2k	n4nd0, easier than transitioning CLabels :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :D so the CStructuredModel I should include it in the child class right?
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, in the header of StructuredOutputMachine
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ah ok
@sonney2k	you put class CStructuredModel; directly after the namespace shogun {
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I just thought that I had to do that in the classes that extend CStructuredModel
@sonney2k	n4nd0, in every class that needs a CStructuredModel as input
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok got it, thanks! I am going to try it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: about the mosek licenses
 n4nd0	sonney2k: nico told me that the evaluation ones expire after three months
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but that I should be able to get a new evaluation one
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that has all the capabilities for yet three more months
 wiking	  n4nd0 yes it does
 wiking	n4nd0: if u want i can send u a new license
 wiking	i needed a new one as well
 n4nd0	sonney2k: all right, you fixed my problem with modular interface :)

 n4nd0	wiking: hey! do you have a moment now?
 wiking	yeah sure
 wiking	shoot
 wiking	u need a new license?
 n4nd0	wiking: it's about SO framework
 wiking	ok
 n4nd0	wiking: I think I can manage to download a license
 wiking	well i can just fwd u again as last time
 wiking	so that you don't have to ask for a new one
 n4nd0	wiking: ok then
 n4nd0	wiking: did you get a new one?
 wiking	yeps
 wiking	what was the email again
 wiking	?
 wiking	done
 wiking	should be good for 2 more months
 n4nd0	wiking: so Nico found some flaws about having the StructuredModel separated into different classes
 wiking	aaah
 wiking	hit me
 n4nd0	one for the argmax, another for the psi, etc
 wiking	yep the one we've talked about last week
 n4nd0	the problem is that they normally rely on each other and it's difficult to make them fully separated
 blackburn	oh 8/8, thanks guys!
 wiking	hehehe blackburn :)
 wiking	n4nd0: ok i get it that they are relying on each other
 wiking	but still why would it be difficult to separate them?
 n4nd0	wiking: I am not sure exactly about the reasons
 n4nd0	wiking: but what I found is that for example
 n4nd0	if the argmax needs the loss and joint feature function
 n4nd0	then you have with the argmax a class that contains the same logic as the whole model
 n4nd0	and it loses a bit of sense
 wiking	oh
 wiking	i see what you mean
 n4nd0	:)
 wiking	that we might end up
 wiking	having a class that contains a class that contains the the parent class
 wiking	right?
 wiking	A has B has A
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	mmm I don't think that problem really arises
 n4nd0	but it would be more like
 n4nd0	you have the Model that contains the argmax, the loss and psi
 n4nd0	but argmax needs loss and psi too
 wiking	blackburn: btw: russia will win this eurocup
 wiking	n4nd0: yep that's more or less what i'm saying
 n4nd0	wiking: ok then
 wiking	that you have class A that has B, C,D
 wiking	and B will have C, D as well
 n4nd0	exactly
 wiking	c = loss, d = psi
 n4nd0	that was the problem I found, but I think that Nico had other reasons too
 wiking	well just pass the reference to the parent?
 wiking	n4nd0: was it discussed here?
 wiking	i.e. can i find it in irc logs?
 n4nd0	wiking: yes, I'll send you the link now
 wiking	ok cool
 n4nd0	wiking: but even if you pass the reference to the parent
 n4nd0	wiking: the thing would be that the model or the argmax loses its meaning
 wiking	well not necessarily
 wiking	i mean if u need psi and loss for argmax
 wiking	then u need it
 wiking	thus it's still argmax
 wiking	the only question is how do u have the reference on these
 n4nd0	wiking: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/%23shogun.2012-06-07.log.html the converation about it starts around 15:45
 wiking	ok
 wiking	reading/parsing
 wiking	"latent guys"
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	people cannot see you
 wiking	"nicococoexample: for latent svms i think we also need a delta(y_i,y_bar,h_latent)"
 wiking	that's not true
 n4nd0	it's just the joint feature right?
 wiking	no i mean
 wiking	i don't need that delta
 wiking	only delta(y, y_bar)
 n4nd0	yeah ok, I meant like it's the joint feature the only one that accounts for h
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i've read it
 wiking	tilld 16:57
 wiking	*till
 n4nd0	so? would you still like more to have the division into classes?
 n4nd0	CArgMax, etc
 wiking	well
 wiking	for me that makes my life easier
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	if u are strongly against it
 n4nd0	I think that to have just a CStructuredModel and extend that one is good
 wiking	then i guess we'll just have to live with that
 wiking	and then yeah
 wiking	just derive my own stuff from CStructuredModel
 n4nd0	why do you think it makes your life easier for you?
 wiking	because i don't have to care about anything else in CStructuredModel
 wiking	just about psi and argmax ;)
 n4nd0	wiking: https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/so/MulticlassModel.h take a look here
 wiking	exactly
 n4nd0	so the plan would be to add an additional get_joint_feature_vector
 n4nd0	for latent
 wiking	this is complicated ;)
 n4nd0	that gets int32_t, StructuredData and another int32_t
 wiking	i mean if u think about that i only want to define a psi and an argmax function
 wiking	this is way too complicated
 n4nd0	but you will need to do just that
 wiking	and then each time
 wiking	actually if u wanna be fair
 wiking	you'll need to override const char* get_name() const  function as well
 wiking	since the given class is a new one... ;)
 n4nd0	aned get_dim
 wiking	so it's just weird in my head
 wiking	that for a simple 2 things
 wiking	actually 2 functions
 wiking	i have to override a whole class
 wiking	and ok i get why shouldn't we use function pointers... i.e. swig
 n4nd0	yes, I mean the reasons you are telling me are just saved using function pointers
 n4nd0	and we cannot do that
 wiking	hehe yeah
 wiking	but we could do still structs or classes ;)
 wiking	but then again
 n4nd0	so we can either use a class for each thing (for argmax, for delta, for psi)
 n4nd0	or a class where we can put everything together
 wiking	if u strongly feel about this and as far as i can see nico is quite assertive about this
 wiking	then go with a one class option
 n4nd0	exactly
 n4nd0	this is what we are going for
 wiking	but i do not agree ;)
 n4nd0	haha
 wiking	but it's your code and your stuff
 wiking	so i do not want to interfere too much :)
 n4nd0	I do not agree there :)
 n4nd0	I mean, it is my code ok
 wiking	but then again i'm gonna use it
 wiking	and i want to make my life easier :P
 n4nd0	but it is the "only" option we have
 n4nd0	because we cannot use function pointers
 wiking	friend classes :)
 n4nd0	and discarding them, the option I choose is the one class option
 n4nd0	I suggested that quite at the beginning, but blackburn and sonney2k disagreed about them :S
 wiking	hahahhaha
 wiking	u see
 blackburn	what did I diagree?
 wiking	blackburn: baaastard!
 n4nd0	using friend classes
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	hmm sorry I am lazy to read your discussion - is there any problem related with not having friends?
 blackburn	not for real but in your classes I mean
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	blackburn: :>
 wiking	hahahahah https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/547749_472264696132937_557005192_n.jpg
 n4nd0	we don't even get to install the 10% in Sweden ...
 wiking	blackburn: well using friend for classes would make our lives easier :)
 blackburn	haha
 wiking	n4nd0: :>
 blackburn	I think being flexible is cool so if you really think friends would make it better do it
 n4nd0	wiking: how would you like to use them in any case?
 wiking	n4nd0: well have argmax as a friend class in structuredmodel
 wiking	so anything u have in structuredmodel you'll be able to call from argmax
 n4nd0	wiking: but still, you have to make a class for argmax
 wiking	and why's that a problem in that case?
 n4nd0	and you would do this in order to avoid doing a class child of structuredmodel
 wiking	yes because argmax class would just do the calculation of argmax
 wiking	thus if you inherit from it
 wiking	u want to change the argmax calculation
 wiking	and nothing else
 wiking	not like in case of structuredmodel
 wiking	if u inherit from that
 n4nd0	you can inherit from structuredmodel and just do that too
 wiking	u either change argmax or psi
 wiking	and here or is not exclusive
 wiking	and u might not want to change anything
 wiking	just argmax
 n4nd0	you can do that as it is right now
 wiking	yes
 n4nd0	then?
 wiking	by inheriting from structuredmodel
 wiking	right?
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: bahh 2-1
 n4nd0	blackburn: :(
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am suffering it
 wiking	blackburn: sweden loose?
 n4nd0	blackburn: but to tell the truth ... they really suck
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	yeah cool
 wiking	finally some fun :)
 n4nd0	yeah, against Ukraine
 blackburn	I am not watching it just read in twitter :)
 n4nd0	Ukraine seems a good team so imagine ....
 n4nd0	:D
 wiking	n4nd0: so the thing is that i'm lazy.. so i don't want to reimplement a lot of things, just because of one function change :P
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah, I understand that
 wiking	it's going to be russia i have 10 euros on that one :)
 n4nd0	wiking: but my point is that you don't need to do it with CStructuredModel either
 blackburn	n4nd0: well they have pretty strong teams in national league
 wiking	n4nd0: currently i can only change that way
 blackburn	and well, they have shevchenko
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah
 n4nd0	wiking: you can extend the model and just implement the argmax if you want
 wiking	extend u mean class Whatever : public CStructuredModel
 wiking	right?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	sorry ... java naming :P
 wiking	ok that is a huge overhead
 wiking	for a simple functional change :P
 wiking	imho
 wiking	:)
 wiking	because this will require me
 wiking	defining ctors and dtors
 wiking	calling the parent ctors
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	yeah it'd be easier in case of using structs
 wiking	;)
 wiking	so argmax is a struct
 wiking	http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIG.html#SWIG_nn30
 wiking	wtf is this?
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	haha ok
 n4nd0	if you want to fight for function pointers then sonney2k is your man not me :)
 wiking	no worries
 wiking	that'll never happen
@sonney2k	exactly :D
 wiking	ok go with the implementation that u and nico agreed on
* wiking knows that there's no way to convince sonney2k of anything that he hasn't agreed with from the beginning :P
 n4nd0	sonney2k: if it could work with SWIG, is it just a problem with the documentation?
 wiking	n4nd0: "Occasionally, a C library may include functions that expect to receive pointers to functions--possibly to serve as callbacks. SWIG provides full support for function pointers provided that the callback functions are defined in C and not in the target language."
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah, I read that
 wiking	so one could not define a function for argmax in python
@sonney2k	wiking, sure I read that doc
@sonney2k	but have you seen how much effort it is?
 wiking	and pass it
 wiking	sonney2k: it's bs
@sonney2k	you will need to add some rules for every function ptr
 n4nd0	wiking: for that we would use director classes
 wiking	sonney2k: so i'm really not pushing this agenda :P
 wiking	i mean it's really a nightmare
@sonney2k	exactly
@sonney2k	I have no idea how directors (which are crazy enough already) would work with this stuff
 blackburn	I admit I was pretty near to commit code containing for_each and std::list day before yesterday
 n4nd0	blackburn: std rebellion!!
 n4nd0	I vote for it
 wiking	blackburn: :DDD
 blackburn	however later I have changed it to CList :(
@sonney2k	which is a good idea if you want to have serialization
@sonney2k	finally apple releases a high-resolution macbook :D
@sonney2k	2880x1800 pixel - yay!
 wiking	:D
@sonney2k	keeping font size whole shogun fits on one screen :D
 wiking	hahah and it can handle more than 8 gigs of ram
 blackburn	http://www.tresnormale.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/fb45191b411f14614b63ea9368cac7bf.jpg
 blackburn	sonney2k: 2.3K$, right?
@sonney2k	I guess I need to go back to academia to get it funded :D
 blackburn	hahha
 blackburn	good reason
 wiking	loooool
@sonney2k	or I have to blackmail any of you ;-)
 n4nd0	lol
 wiking	in KL everything was a lot cheaper than here in europe :)
 blackburn	KL?
 wiking	mac stuff at least by 200 euros
 wiking	(malaysia)
 blackburn	ah
 wiking	1715 euros vs 2300 euros for the 15-inch: 2,3-GHz Retina-display
 wiking	:>
 wiking	that's almost a whooping 600 euros
 blackburn	it will cost 3.5K here I think
 blackburn	w/o ebay :D
@sonney2k	I guess the display is really pricey... >1k
 wiking	lol wtf
 wiking	why is there 2 gnu in that machine?
 wiking	Intel HD Graphics 4000 and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M?
 wiking	*gpu
 blackburn	it is something common now
 wiking	really? cool i guess u can opencl the shit out of those )
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	shit I have exam day after tomorrow
 blackburn	problem is that it will be about everything :D
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah even my mac has this
@sonney2k	and it is 4 years old...
 n4nd0	do you like mac guys?
 n4nd0	I mean if you like mac computers ... it was a bit ambiguous :P
 wiking	sonney2k: not mine.... :S
 blackburn	I have good old samsung
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I do - excellent hardware. only the os is crap :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how do manage with linux on it?
 n4nd0	lot of problems?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am running linux on macs since 8 years or so
@sonney2k	for 8 years :D
@sonney2k	back then (titanium powerpc based mac)
@sonney2k	there was no other notebook that could handle 5 hours battery time
@sonney2k	long before intel built reasonable mobile cpus
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.161.30] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	ahh and I could hot plug a battery once the other one got empty
 n4nd0	the battery in my computer sucks so badly...
@sonney2k	so I had ~8 hours of battery and that is how shogun became to existence
 n4nd0	nice
@sonney2k	looong train rides
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	did you code most of it in the train?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, back then almost everything
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	deutsche railroad should be in (C)
@sonney2k	sponsord by deutsche bahn delays :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you live in poland? why so long train rides?
 n4nd0	did people look what you were doing or something?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	others where having windows notebooks
@sonney2k	I got asked a lot how long these macs can run on battery ...
 blackburn	bumps while riding should determine bad formatting at some places
 n4nd0	haha
@sonney2k	blackburn, I can assure you that we don't have jumping ICE trains :D
 blackburn	ah poor you have no bumpy roads :(
@sonney2k	crazy!
@sonney2k	on this galaxy s3 the led color is fully programmable
@sonney2k	each app can have its own notification color...
