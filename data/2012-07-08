 wiking	oh configure script why you no work!
 blackburn	n4nd0: want to fix some bugs?
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am bit busy with some other bugs in the HM-SVM
 n4nd0	but yeah of course
 blackburn	ah ok
 n4nd0	I can lend a hand there if so
 blackburn	no rather do HM-SVM :)
 n4nd0	where are they?
 blackburn	n4nd0: mainly in serialization and parameter trees
 blackburn	good news for heiko
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	:S
 n4nd0	files? where do they fire?
 blackburn	ah

 blackburn	bahh
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: nevermind let heiko fix that :)
 n4nd0	I will not start with them right away because I am with this HM-SVM test
 blackburn	no problem
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will tell you again once I am done and if they are not fixed I will dive in ;)
 wiking	anyone seen something like this before
 wiking	features/SparseFeatures.cpp: In member function 'void shogun::CSparseFeatures<ST>::free_sparse_feature_matrix()':
 wiking	features/SparseFeatures.cpp:95: error: expected class-name before '(' token
 blackburn	wiking: wow
 n4nd0	wiking: I don't recognize it
 wiking	although i'm a bit puzzled by that line
 wiking	SGSparseVector<ST>* sparse_feature_matrix;
 blackburn	wiking: try to add include of SGSparseVector
 wiking	aah ok
 wiking	(&sparse_feature_matrix[i])->~SGSparseVector();
 blackburn	just some guess
 blackburn	don't ask :D
 blackburn	well
 wiking	why do we need the address?
 blackburn	it is caused
 wiking	and not just sparse_feature_matrix[].~ ...
 blackburn	by the allocate thing
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	yes you are right it is the same
 blackburn	I thought you are asking why the heck we are calling dtor manually
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	but it doesn't help :))
 blackburn	wiking: include?
 blackburn	interesting
 wiking	mmm i'll try now
 blackburn	wiking: what doesn't help?
 wiking	nop
 blackburn	prediction error on training data (3 classes): 0.308333 random guess error would be: 0.666667
 blackburn	LOL
 wiking	                ((SGSparseVector<ST>*)&sparse_feature_matrix[i])->~SGSparseVector();
 wiking	doesn't help either
 wiking	hahah this is weird shit
 blackburn	yeah kind of
 wiking	mmm let's see
 wiking	ok
 wiking	it's the gcc
 blackburn	wiking: what is -v?
 wiking	c++ (GCC) 4.2.1 20070831 patched [FreeBSD]
 wiking	so this doesn't like it
 blackburn	woooow
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	c++46 (FreeBSD Ports Collection) 4.6.4 20120608 (prerelease)
 wiking	takes it
 blackburn	newer than mine
 wiking	what's your numba?
 blackburn	gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)
 wiking	anybody has 4.2.x compiler around?
 wiking	on a different os?
 blackburn	IIRC 4.2 is really some crappy v
 blackburn	or <4.4
 wiking	yeah but still
 wiking	we need to check then in configure script ;P
 wiking	ok
 wiking	same with 4.2 c++ on osx
 blackburn	wiking: does it work with 4.6 on your machine?
 wiking	blackburn: on fbsd it does with 4.6
 wiking	on osx i have clang 3.1 by default
 wiking	and that does as well
 wiking	only that 4.2.1 does not like it neither on osx nor on freebsd
 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	i think it's a gcc bug
 blackburn	yeah seems to be
 wiking	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23287
 wiking	here's the bug for it
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	argh
 wiking	Fixed for 4.4.
 wiking	fixed for 4.3 as well, closing.
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so this is crashing in 4.1.x and 4.2.x
 wiking	only works from 4.3.x
 wiking	so i guess it's safe to add a gcc 4.3.x dependency in the configure script
 blackburn	wiking: yeah
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r77ab132 / (3 files in 3 dirs): Fixed MKL libshogun example - http://git.io/bK_ZRA
 blackburn	wiking: do we check version?
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	wiking: where?
 wiking	                                        case $cxx_version in
 wiking	                                                2.96*)
 wiking	                                                        cxx_version="$cxx_version, bad"
 wiking	                                                        cxx_found=no
 wiking	apparently 2.96* is bad :)

@sonney2k	blackburn, google-chrome works again :-) The problem only happens when I use the kernel 3.5-rcX but not under 3.4.X !
@sonney2k	kind of wtf!
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	kind of regression I'd say
@sonney2k	I cannot tell how happy I am
@sonney2k	yeah I reported that throuh all possible channels... lets see if they will laugh at me :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: my AC thing is solved too (for now)
@sonney2k	one happy family
@sonney2k	now only heiko needs to fix the build and rieck setup betty :D
 heiko	sonney2k, just started looking at it :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have any overheat problems with your MBP?
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, the x-val example did work, what was recently changed?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well 60C is the CPU
 blackburn	heiko: puffin444's stuff I guess
 blackburn	sonney2k: idle?
@sonney2k	yeah
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	k
@sonney2k	wiking, about the freebsd patch
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just wanted to say I managed to slow down internal gpu and it is something like -2C to before
@sonney2k	wiking, are you sure that HAVE_ATLAS='#define HAVE_ATLAS 1' is correct?
@sonney2k	wiking, sounded like it should be just HAVE_LAPACK='#define HAVE_LAPACK 1'
@sonney2k	heiko, well the buildbot has it all - basically only puffins stuff touches the x-val stuff
 heiko	yeah ok, I will have a look now
@sonney2k	wiking, and I don't understand the getline change
@sonney2k	it must be ::getline I am afraid
 blackburn	sonney2k: freebsd has getline issues
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	otherwise it is an endless recursion
 wiking	sonney2k: i was compiling with ATLAS
 wiking	sonney2k: so it should have HAVE_ATLAS='#define HAVE_ATLAS 1'
@sonney2k	ok
 wiking	and as well as lapack
 blackburn	heiko: ah btw I made print_result of CVResult  virtual
 blackburn	have you seen?
 wiking	sonney2k: for the ::getline it just says no such function... only getline...
 heiko	not yet, but makes sense right :)
 wiking	sonney2k: i couldn't fix it other way :(
@sonney2k	wiking, but then it will take the one from CAsciiFile
 blackburn	heiko: I had troubles with printing out result
 blackburn	heiko: ah btw two questions
 heiko	k
 blackburn	what is ratio to divide train/test set in StratifiedCrossValidation?
 blackburn	how much vectors will it take as train vectors?
@sonney2k	wiking, http://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/3/getline/
@sonney2k	seems like it works slightly differently
 heiko	what do you mean?
 heiko	mmh well you specify a number of folds
 wiking	sonney2k: it's the same function arg as far as i can see
 blackburn	heiko: right
 heiko	then nr_examples / folds is the size of test data
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	I didn't know that
 heiko	and one of the training sets might be larger smaller by one
 blackburn	heiko: is it something common practice?
 blackburn	I am pretty lame with xval to be honest
 heiko	maybe it should be specified in the doc
 heiko	blackburn, yes thats practice
 blackburn	I see
 heiko	divide into equal sized sets
 wiking	sonney2k: the only thing is this stupid hack about #define _WITH_GETLINE
 heiko	and then use all but one for training
 heiko	for all combinations
 wiking	sonney2k: but yeah even using that doesn't help with ::getline
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but then ::getline() should work
 blackburn	heiko: I thought of 50/50 or so
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	in stratified also, the class ratios are tried to kept equal
 wiking	sonney2k: but it doesnt :)
 heiko	blackburn, thats 2 folds :)
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	wiking, what exactly does it say?
 wiking	sonney2k: lemme reproduce it
 blackburn	heiko: if I have one parameter only
@sonney2k	wiking, with the rest I am fine
 blackburn	should I put it into root or to child of root?
 heiko	blackburn, the extreme is LOO, that is as many folds as training examples
 wiking	sonney2k: have u seen the gcc bug
 wiking	sonney2k: that's pretty funny ;)
 heiko	to child of root
 wiking	sonney2k: io/AsciiFile.cpp:1089:9: error: '::getline' has not been declared

 blackburn	heiko: I actually have something strange with xval
 heiko	blackburn, what is it?
 blackburn	heiko: it chooses value with AUC = 0.5 :D
 wiking	sonney2k: and i've tried googling about this, but no help until now :(
 wiking	i mean about ::getline
 heiko	you mean model selection
 heiko	grid-search?
 blackburn	heiko: yeah sure

 blackburn	I do not separate these two parts so much :D
 heiko	it depends on which criterion you optimize, do you optimize for AUC? (Thats not always a good idea)
 wiking	sonney2k: another possibility is that i use that work around for freebsd as in case for __MACH__
 heiko	and the direction is important, might be that you minimize or so :)
@sonney2k	wiking, problem really is that this won't work with just getline()
@sonney2k	just because the signatures overlap
 heiko	since 0.5 AUC is the worst classifier that you can construct for symmetric class ratio :)
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i guess it'll be a infinite recurisve call
 blackburn	heiko: yeah I know
 blackburn	heiko: but isn't maximize default for ROC?
 heiko	Should be
 blackburn	ok I'll check
 heiko	but this would mean that ALL AUC values are 0.5

 wiking	sonney2k: we are trying to call std::getline right?
 blackburn	tree lasso that is - makes w=0 at some pointt
 wiking	mm no...
 wiking	well then i really wonder
 heiko	blackburn, no idea of that

 wiking	blame meeee
 heiko	if not, you could add debug outputs for the results of each fold
 heiko	then youll see if there is something wrong
 blackburn	heiko: what do I see is
 blackburn	yes I enabled it before
 blackburn	AUC is better on other values
 heiko	you mean you optimize another criterion?
 heiko	and then compute AUC for result?
 wiking	oh ok this is not my fault ;)
 heiko	I remember that there were some errors in the evaluation classes some time ago, but I did not use all of them so maybe some of them are still in there
 heiko	blackburn, this was due to the changes in the labels
 heiko	remember?
 heiko	I never use AUC, so perhaps there is a problem or so
 heiko	with the transition to Binary/blabla labels
 blackburn	heiko: https://gist.github.com/3071792
@sonney2k	wiking, how about the following: you copy the freebsd code for getline into CAsciiFile::getline in the #ifdef __MACH__
 wiking	sonney2k: or just #ifdef __MACH__ || FREEBSD
 wiking	?
@sonney2k	and then change it to #if defined(__MACH__) || defined(FREEBSD)
 heiko	blackburn that seems correct
@sonney2k	wiking, the getline function is wrong in MACH It seems
 heiko	could you give me the data?
 heiko	then Ill have a look
 blackburn	heiko: sure
@sonney2k	or maybe not
 heiko	blackburn, might take a while, currently fixing other bugs
@sonney2k	it is actually correct :D
 blackburn	heiko: let me check it now then :)
@sonney2k	wiking, so yes just  #if defined(__MACH__) || defined(FREEBSD)
 blackburn	first of all I am going to check whether optimization direction is correct
 wiking	sonney2k: ok

 wiking	letssee if it compiles alright ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmhh for these you should next time really use git commit --amend
@sonney2k	so that it is just one commit instead of 4
@sonney2k	(and the push with --force thoug)
@sonney2k	h
@sonney2k	wiking, alright buildslave:
@sonney2k	wiking, did you already run buildslave  create-slave
 wiking	tried
@sonney2k	wiking, send me some password you like
 wiking	it told me that i need to give more info
 wiking	basedir> <master> <name> <passwd>
 wiking	i guess apart from master i can give whatever i want ;)
@sonney2k	lets call it shogun-freebsd as user
@sonney2k	password - your choice :D
 blackburn	heiko: ok Z is set corrrect
 wiking	and what's the master?
 blackburn	heiko: but print_result produces something wrong I guess
@sonney2k	wiking, www.shogun-toolbox.org
 wiking	ok
@sonney2k	wiking, alright so now what do we want to build on that machine?
@sonney2k	just libshogun or other stuff too?
 wiking	sonney2k: mmm i haven't tried other stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, I would suggest to start with libshogun...
 heiko	blackburn, so the model selection works but the printing is wrong
 wiking	thus i guess i dont have the dependencies installed for everything
 blackburn	heiko: I guess so
 heiko	you could do a
 heiko	best_parameters.print()
 heiko	or print_tree or so
 heiko	forgot the name
 wiking	sonney2k: ok i've edited the files under ./info

@sonney2k	wiking, when it works it should be listed here http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/buildslaves
 wiking	yep
 wiking	but something went wrong ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, authentification problem
@sonney2k	did you use shogun-freebsd1 as name?
@sonney2k	wiking, when you vim buildbot.tac
@sonney2k	look at slavename
@sonney2k	it should be 'shogun-freebsd1'
 wiking	oh no
 wiking	it's just shogun-freebsd
 wiking	but i'l change
 wiking	ok
@sonney2k	yeah change it and buildslave start again

 wiking	shouldn't it be cd source/src & ./configure --cc=gcc46 --cxx=c++46 --interfaces= --prefix=../../build
 wiking	?
 wiking	mm
 wiking	actually i dont know
 wiking	i have a bsd1_-_libshogun dir under which there are 2 dirs: build and source
@sonney2k	wiking, do you have /bin/bash ?
 wiking	but well ... it tried under /usr/home/wiking/shogun-buildbot/bsd1_-_libshogun/build
 wiking	sonney2k: nono, freebsd doesn't have that
 wiking	:)
 wiking	by default
 wiking	i have /usr/local/bin/bash
@sonney2k	ok that is the reason then
 wiking	but try rather /usr/bin/env bash
 wiking	;)

@sonney2k	wiking, at some point we could add more to the freebsd buildbot, like static and dynamic interfaces

 heiko	sonney2k, yeah, I though I had broken something again :)
@sonney2k	heiko, can you do anything about the current crashers?
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, has something changed in context of threads and kernel machines?
@sonney2k	the real ones I mean
 heiko	Currently investigating
@sonney2k	heiko, why? waht?
 heiko	I have the suspiction that subsets are used /set/unset from multiple threads
 heiko	which *will* crash
 heiko	and might explain the error where assertion fails  that there is a different number of labels
 heiko	any changes in that recently?
@sonney2k	blackburn,^?
 blackburn	hm
@sonney2k	I didn't change anything there
 blackburn	what did I change is zeroing of result vector
 blackburn	in case of batch evaluation
@sonney2k	yeah that was OK I think
 heiko	ok Ill check a bi tmore
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand though what we had there initially
 blackburn	sonney2k: we had no sgvector before here I guess
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but then we should have had the same error...
 blackburn	sonney2k: if there was calloc before - no
@sonney2k	            float64_t* output=SG_MALLOC(float64_t, num_vectors);
@sonney2k	            memset(output, 0, sizeof(float64_t)*num_vectors);
@sonney2k	that was there before
 blackburn	sonney2k: then the bug we introduced
@sonney2k	I actually
@sonney2k	for some reason I had in mind that sgvector uses CALLOC
@sonney2k	well

 heiko	blackburn, it was you!
 heiko	I knew it
 heiko	you are evil! ;)
 blackburn	heiko: what did I do?
 heiko	why did you comment out lines 268 ... from KernelMachine?
 heiko	that breaks apply(CFeatures*)
 blackburn	damn
 heiko	and since this example of mine is the only test where this is covered it fails
 blackburn	it was mistake of mine cause I did that only for test
 heiko	its alright
 heiko	Ill put it in again
 blackburn	 I didn't mean to break your heart

 heiko	blackburn, say what could be the reason that an example fails during make tests
 heiko	but works when I run it alone?
 blackburn	heiko: puzzles?
 heiko	whats that?
 blackburn	interesting
 blackburn	I mean you ask me for puzzle solve
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	hehe
 heiko	amazing
 heiko	runs with valgrind
 heiko	but not without
 blackburn	heiko: I can't mind any reason
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	that is not so interesting
 blackburn	it happens often
 heiko	and no leak
 heiko	why is that?
 heiko	actually many many libshogun examples are failing locally here
 heiko	with that problem
 heiko	why is it?
 blackburn	with which problem
 blackburn	?
 heiko	/home/heiko/Desktop/shogun/shogun/examples/undocumented/libshogun/modelselection_grid_search_string_kernel.cpp
 heiko	for example
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	valgrind makes it run
 heiko	but it doesnt without
 blackburn	heiko: segmentation fault or what?
 heiko	and I get strange CMap assertion errors
 heiko	WTF
 heiko	thats my commetn

 heiko	blackburn, sonney2k, what do you think of gnu-intend ?
 blackburn	heiko: never tried but I don't mind to reformat everything
 heiko	I think that would be an idea, esp. doing it automatically
 blackburn	heiko: all examples passed
 heiko	strange!
 heiko	here, no
 heiko	do you  have trace-mallocs enabled?
 heiko	blackburn, ^
 blackburn	no
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	that might be the reason
 heiko	Ill disable it
 blackburn	hm CMap?
 blackburn	I guess it is
 heiko	yeh
 heiko	yeah its CMap
 heiko	runs when I deactivate trace-mallocs
 heiko	but the valgrind things is even more strange
 heiko	blackburn, also your example all fail when trace-mallocs is on
 heiko	do you use CMap?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	trace-mallocs does
 blackburn	heiko: which mine?
 heiko	in the embeddings
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	Ill recompile and tell you

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you mind to change to openmp next week?
 blackburn	n4nd0: can you invest some time?
 blackburn	next week, again
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you can get rid of pthreads and make sure everything is at same speed sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: no way to make it in one commit but I can start
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd ask you to help me with openmping
 n4nd0	blackburn: the only thing I know is that it is something related to multithreading :)
 blackburn	quite easy
 n4nd0	blackburn: but it would be cool to learn about it!
 blackburn	you just declare pragma omp with some parameters
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm ok, so tell me more in particular what needs to be done and so
 blackburn	n4nd0: we have a few classes using pthreads
 blackburn	all one need is to get it serial first
 blackburn	and then declare OMP pragma before 'for' statement
 blackburn	sonney2k: so ok to start?
 n4nd0	blackburn: has something been ported already so I can take a look?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah it was somewhere in my branches
 blackburn	I hope I didn't lost it
 blackburn	yeaaah I didn't!
 blackburn	would be hard to merge probably now
 blackburn	let me try
 blackburn	n4nd0: are you busy right now?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I prefer one commit for pthread -> openmp - it doesn't really help us to cause new trouble/dependencies
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you kidding?
@sonney2k	and I really don't know if we can change *everything* to be as fast as it was with pthreads
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	http://www.legoturingmachine.org/
 blackburn	it helps us
 blackburn	lesser code is better
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course but the whole purpose of parallelizing things is that it gets faster
 blackburn	sonney2k: openmp *can't* be slower
@sonney2k	and I failed back then with openmp
 blackburn	with proper options
@sonney2k	haha
@sonney2k	create a branch for that and push it / and keep it regularly in sync
 blackburn	sonney2k: I already tested CDistance and openmp is even slightly faster
@sonney2k	but one push to master for that
 blackburn	hmmm ok I don't mind separate branch
@sonney2k	that is no guarantee that it works on the other stuff too
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah sorry, I am trying to buy plane tickets to Spain
 blackburn	heh
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will be back here in a few minutes
 blackburn	going to spain?
 n4nd0	blackburn: some days in August yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, I recall doing the ocas parallelization with openmp and it was just slow
@sonney2k	all CPUs had 100% load
@sonney2k	but no speedup
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you use nowait, dynamic schedule?
 blackburn	with different scheduling routines I've got different results
@sonney2k	no idea - did that about 7 years ago...
@sonney2k	blackburn, but I really think that now that n4nd0, pluskid etc have some .pdf - documentation is much more important right now
 blackburn	wellllllll
 blackburn	try to push them then :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, they did the work already
@sonney2k	so we are waiting for your shogun-doc git repo to merge the stuff
 blackburn	ok I'll come up with template and start to merge then
@sonney2k	thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: but I remember you didn't like the book idea
 blackburn	what has changed?
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	I said that for a book it needs some person pushing it for probably 2 years
 blackburn	who is that person then?
@sonney2k	no idea? you?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	but this here is about to have *some* documentation that is more user friendly
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you manage to get the others into the boat then it might be possible to keep it up-to-date
@sonney2k	otherwise what we have (documentation in the code) is the only thing that will remotely be up-to-date
 blackburn	sonney2k: should tutorial be submodule of shogun?
