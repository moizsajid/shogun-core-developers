 hushell	iglesiasg: hey! still awake?
@iglesiasg	hushell, well already more than still hehe
@iglesiasg	hushell, I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night
 hushell	iglesiasg: sometimes I do like you :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I feel better at night
 hushell	MSG_DEBUG is the same as SG_DEBUG?
@iglesiasg	yeah sure
@iglesiasg	to activate the prints made inside SG_DEBUG
@iglesiasg	one needs to do this shogun_object->io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I need to include SGIO.h, isn't it?
@iglesiasg	hushell, where exactly?
 hushell	iglesiasg: sometimes I got error, say SG_DEBUG is not defined
@iglesiasg	hushell, aham. I don't remember exactly which header is it bug I think SGIO.h is not necessary
 hushell	but SG_SPRINT is safe everytime
@iglesiasg	probably shogun/lib/config.h
 hushell	hmm, so your point is change every SG_SPRINT to SG_DEBUG?
@iglesiasg	hushell, well I think that maybe it is not necessary
@iglesiasg	since we are going to keep verbose
@iglesiasg	as it does a little bit more than SG_DEBUG
@iglesiasg	maybe it is just fine to keep them with SG_SPRINT or SG_PRINT
 hushell	iglesiasg: I just try to imitate what Michal did for BMRMs
@iglesiasg	hushell, sounds reasonable
 hushell	iglesiasg: so now we have helper member for every SOSVM solvers
@iglesiasg	hushell, nice!
@iglesiasg	hushell, are all the objectives  comparable then?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I think so, they computed by the same function
@iglesiasg	hushell, that sounds neat
@iglesiasg	hushell, maybe we could try that for some data set
@iglesiasg	plot the objective obtained with different solvers
 hushell	yeah, sounds great!
 hushell	I still haven't implement the duality gap function, I'll do it this weekend
@iglesiasg	nice
 hushell	okay, let me update the python example
@iglesiasg	hushell, what is the interpretation of the duality gap?
 hushell	iglesiasg: The simplest one is primal-dual, but we have different way to compute dual, like Patrick's BCFW paper, they has show a special case of Fenchel duality gap
 hushell	iglesiasg: I am not expert on this. I need to check in detail before implementing useful statistics
@iglesiasg	I see, I have no idea about what the duality gap is really
 hushell	iglesiasg: The primal solution - lagrangian dual solution is very intuitive, the Fenchel duality is a bit complicate
 hushell	iglesiasg: Patrick's friend Julien Mairal is an expert on this, maybe try to read his papers :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: okay, updated the minor issue
@iglesiasg	all right, off now
@iglesiasg	see you later

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, dont' get burned
 besser82	HeikoS: on last email there was written 10:00h UTC
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, too cold though :(
@HeikoS	besser82: wasnt that UTC -1 or so
@HeikoS	-2
@HeikoS	yeah UTC +2
@HeikoS	which is 15 mins ago
 lisitsyn1	it was a mistake yeah so it should be now
 besser82	I see...
@HeikoS	besser82: you are here anyways ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, there was a last mail saying 10:00 UTC+2
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: do you have an agenda?
 besser82	Friday 12:00 UTC+2.
 besser82	I'll try to prepare some agenda.
 besser82	Cheers,
 besser82	Sergey
@iglesiasg	anyway, what I do is just to trust the doodle, it shows local time so perfect
 besser82	HeikoS, lisitsyn:  ^^^^
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: well not really strict
 lisitsyn1	besser82: yeah but I send another mail just along
 lisitsyn1	sent*
@iglesiasg	besser82, there was a new mail after that
 lisitsyn1	sorry if I confused you
@HeikoS	is wiking around?
 besser82	lisitsyn1: np
 besser82	wiking: ping?
@sonney2k	ok lets next time only use UTC
@iglesiasg	besser82, anyhow, is it a good moment for you now too?
@sonney2k	and everyone has to do the math on her own
 lisitsyn1	yeah sorry it is always confusing but I didn't found way around
 besser82	iglesiasg: np, in 5mins i'll be fie  ;)
 lisitsyn1	ok let me reboot
@iglesiasg	besser82, cool, then we are fine :)

@lisitsyn	so what's up
@lisitsyn	are we ready to start?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: as for agenda it looks release thing is overwhelming
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: everyone is, go for it!
* besser82 is on go
* iglesiasg is ready
 wiking	ok so when's the meeting on the end?
 wiking	now or lateR? :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: now!
@lisitsyn	okay lets start
@lisitsyn	thanks for joining this meeting
@lisitsyn	we now have gsoc ended and we've got a lot of new code
@lisitsyn	and we planned release
* besser82 thanks lisitsyn for chairing
@lisitsyn	so lets talk how can we prepare for release
@lisitsyn	and when should it be
@HeikoS	The original plan (github milstone) was now
@HeikoS	or a few days ago
@lisitsyn	yeah lets check milestone
@HeikoS	but there are quite a few open issues remaining
@lisitsyn	yeah a lot
@HeikoS	some of them are not release relevant though
@lisitsyn	I wouldn't get to discuss them all though
@lisitsyn	so how do you think we should handle that?
@HeikoS	it would take ages to solve all of them, but we can release with just the most important ones fixed
 besser82	but there's lot of new code during last days... is it tested well enough?
@lisitsyn	besser82: no, of course no ;)
@HeikoS	my suggestion would be re-name milestone 3.0 to 3.1 and move the most important things to 3.0
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	then discuss who does them
@lisitsyn	so everybody just
 wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	we kind of did that last time, but since then, we collected more and more
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you think?
 wiking	the bugs present in mileston 3.0
 wiking	should stay
@lisitsyn	check issues and let us know if you think they are not important
 wiking	lisitsyn: malsar leak ;)
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah I remember
 wiking	anyhow
 wiking	1701: is out of our hand
 wiking	but actually it's not leaking
 wiking	so it's ok now
 wiking	we could close that one
 wiking	1694-6 should be fixed in 3.0
@lisitsyn	wiking: lets just glance over it next days and try to remove a few
 wiking	(1693 included)
 wiking	i dont know about 1684 and 1680
@iglesiasg	wiking, what about 1664 finally?
 wiking	1625 is fixed - or at least it's going to be fixed today
@lisitsyn	lets rather talk about resources we have ;)
@lisitsyn	how much time do you have to work on that?
 wiking	1664 is something that is known by ubuntu devs
 wiking	1488 can be closed
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn all these smaller things are not sooo important I would say, we can always do a bugfix release
 wiking	as besser82 did this for us thanx again for that
 wiking	the memleaks (1477) are getting in shape
 wiking	so that can be closed as well soon
 thoralf	Yes.
 wiking	what really remains
 wiking	is 'infrastructure' stuff
 wiking	integration of demo
 wiking	sonney2k: just did the notebook hacking
 wiking	or like ' Restructure and update NEWS '
 wiking	which is all just non-dev releated stuff..
@lisitsyn	important enough though
 wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah NEWS and feature list will be done by the weekend
 wiking	1590 is going to be fixed as soon as besser82 gets us the cloud in shape
 wiking	HeikoS: great!
 wiking	what i would really like to be fixed still is: 1548
@lisitsyn	what date of release would you like?
 wiking	 Most of the python examples fail with python3
@HeikoS	besser82, wiking it would be great to have an access to the cloud stuff for the NIPS application, I will also do that on the weekend
@HeikoS	wiking: python3 is not important for now I would say
 wiking	HeikoS: well it's getting really more and more into major OS distribs
 wiking	hence it'd be great to have a fix for that
@HeikoS	wiking: I know, but just for this release I mean
 besser82	wiking: most of it can be resolved by using 2to3 (python3)
@lisitsyn	guys, date
 wiking	besser82: yeah those are fixed ;)
@lisitsyn	;)
 wiking	besser82: the remaining problem is more complicated :P
@sonney2k	HeikoS, talk to me what you want to do before you do it
 wiking	lisitsyn: 15th of oct
@HeikoS	we should aim for next week release or so
 besser82	wiking: allright, will have a look on that....
@HeikoS	sonney2k: will send a draft to mailing list
@sonney2k	regarding notebooks - we need some .txt file with a short description
@HeikoS	sonney2k: news: just a nice text with all the added features
 wiking	i'd go for a mid october release
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no I mean the structure of NEWS needs to stay or else a couple of scripts won't work
@HeikoS	sonney2k: features: I will start something from which we can extend
* besser82 will get the CMake refactoring ready over weekend
 wiking	HeikoS: when's the deadline?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah I dont want to change that, just to write a release text
@HeikoS	wiking: 8th or so
@HeikoS	wiking: I have to do it on the weekend
@sonney2k	regarding notebooks again - we need some .txt file for each with a short description!
 wiking	besser82: so we need to have really the notebook server up and running this weekend
@HeikoS	so one thing: I will disappear more or less after this weekend, phd courses. WIll be back Feb
 wiking	if that's not doable, let me know and i'll setup a small thing temporarily
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: feb is february?
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	yikes
 wiking	HeikoS: hehe not so good news... what's going to be with the 'views' of features? :)
@HeikoS	wiking: will try to do that on a weekend ;)
 besser82	wiking: the problem is sth. is screwed in redhat'S openStack.  That the problem for the persistent storage...
@HeikoS	wiking: what changes is that I wont be around during the day anymore
 wiking	besser82: since HeikoS really needs to have that server up and running for a conference application
@HeikoS	wiking: doesnt need to be perfect though
 wiking	besser82: it's alright if we cannot have it by the weekend... we'll have it when we have it
@HeikoS	wiking: and NIPS is in december, it should work nicely until then
 besser82	wiking: if you can get sth. temporary it would be fine
 wiking	besser82: i'll just have to setup the other attempt i had last time...
@HeikoS	but for application, just basic stuff is enough
 wiking	HeikoS: yeah that's what i thought
 besser82	wiking: You need some V-Server for that?
 wiking	besser82: naaah the whole squashfs is setup
 besser82	wiking: I might have one in spare....
@HeikoS	but what about the release?
 wiking	so it's really a bit more hacking and that's it
 wiking	HeikoS: you mean release + cloud
 wiking	?
@sonney2k	this is how the notebooks look like w/o description http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/notebooks/
 wiking	HeikoS: hopefully the thing with redhat's openstack is going to be fixed by then
 wiking	sonney2k: is this autogen?
@sonney2k	I am extracting the first image from the notebook
@sonney2k	sure
 wiking	cool
 besser82	wiking, HeikoS: the RedHat guys are working on it...
 wiking	sonney2k: i would say that people should write a meaningfull title for the notebooks
@sonney2k	wiking, autogen == done live
@iglesiasg	that looks nice
@HeikoS	I mean the cloud thing should not be part of the release, but something we are doing internally
 wiking	i.e. http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/LMNN.html does not have a title set at all iglesiasg
@sonney2k	wiking, no rather a text file with the same prefix
@HeikoS	the release should focus on exposing the GSoC projects in a nice looking way
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh ok well yeah that too
 wiking	sonney2k: we woudl store it within the repo? those txt files
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: oh btw I think you should link your github account, and the gsoc project page in the notebook
@sonney2k	wiking, yes sure
@sonney2k	directly in the notebook dirs
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sure
 wiking	sonney2k: as we can really set like a meaningful <abstract></abstract> tag in the generated html and just add that to http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/notebooks/
@sonney2k	wiking, then I can display that test instead of the filename
@lisitsyn	okay guys lets get back
@lisitsyn	so wiking votes for 15th of oct
@lisitsyn	does it work for you?
@iglesiasg	wiking, I don't get that thing of the title, why there is none, but I will try to have a look
* besser82 15th Oct  +1
@iglesiasg	lol
@lisitsyn	other thinng is
@lisitsyn	who does the release?
@sonney2k	ohh and our release script is R.I.P
@lisitsyn	haha nice
@sonney2k	so no more make release
@sonney2k	== hours of work
@sonney2k	to do a release
@lisitsyn	I am afraid wiking
 besser82	sonney2k: I can fix that within cmake
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	oh besser82
@lisitsyn	cool
 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: like make tarball
 wiking	besser82: cpak
@sonney2k	it is not that easy
@sonney2k	tarball cpack is easy yes
@lisitsyn	so besser82 & wiking can you approach to repair 'make release'?
 wiking	*cpack
 besser82	wiking: I know  ;)
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah
@lisitsyn	that's for you then ok
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure
@sonney2k	but not signing everything with gpg + upload + automagic news update on website etc
 wiking	we'll the the autosign + hashing etc as well...
 wiking	so that should not be a problem at all
 wiking	besser82: so you're going to have the refactored cmake done during the weekend?
@sonney2k	..uploading to freshmeat, mloss.org writing descr's there
 besser82	wiking: yes
@sonney2k	...updating the website etc
 wiking	sonney2k: should be alriht
 wiking	sonney2k: we still have the access to the script
 wiking	in the master branch
 wiking	so we'll just use that
 wiking	as a guideline
 wiking	and then just we'll create a new target: 'make release'
 wiking	or make dist
@lisitsyn	okay so the plan
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: I think the script should be sth. external from cmake
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you should create a priority list of things needed for the release, linked with github issues and who is responsible, like wiking did last time
 wiking	(maybe that's more appropriate)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah I know
@lisitsyn	so the plan is
@lisitsyn	we should have all issues assigned by tomorrow
@sonney2k	that script is obsolte in some parts too - the website is django now ... anyway we should try to at least get the tarball upload & signing automated
@lisitsyn	wiking & besser82 port the make release script
@sonney2k	then later news -> news on website
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well some issues are days work :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	we need demo integration
@lisitsyn	s what?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we just have to assign them
 wiking	demos are way too cool
 wiking	but we need to add them to the website
@lisitsyn	I am responsible for assigning milestone issues
 wiking	HeikoS: any update on that parameterMap issue with thread data race condition?
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  The testsuite-data should be within release tarball? What do oyu think?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	that's separate
* iglesiasg brb
@sonney2k	besser82, separate
@sonney2k	too big
 wiking	oooh and btw: static analysis error fixes!
@sonney2k	and not required if you don't want to run demos
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  is it really that big?
 wiking	waaaaty too many of them...
@sonney2k	besser82, 200 MB ?
 wiking	besser82: yep
@lisitsyn	okay is that all about release?
@lisitsyn	anyone?
@HeikoS	wiking: no sorry, I havent looked into these race conditions
 thoralf	wiking: Is there a list of errors somewhere?
@HeikoS	wiking: I am not sure how much they will hurt us?
@HeikoS	thoralf: see github milestones
 wiking	HeikoS: ok please get somebody assigned to that one as it really hurts us atm ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: ehm 3.0 milestone
 wiking	thoralf: yes milestone .30
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  I can see ~90 MBytes /data/testsuite
@HeikoS	wiking: what happens?
@HeikoS	wiking: I might de-activate threads in GP stuff, that will solve quitre a feq
 wiking	HeikoS: well it's just destined to fail ;)
@HeikoS	feq
@HeikoS	few
@HeikoS	wiking: ok :)
 thoralf	wiking, HeikoS: Which ticket?
@HeikoS	wiking: will check parameter map
 wiking	thoralf: any ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: filter for milestone 3.0
@HeikoS	you get like 40 or so issues
 wiking	thoralf: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?milestone=3&state=open
 thoralf	wiking: No, I mean: Which ticket for "oooh and btw: static analysis error fixes"
 wiking	thoralf: aaah that's this
 wiking	there's way tooo many of them
 wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/
@lisitsyn	I don't think we need to resolve all of them
 wiking	and just take the last one: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-10-03-1/
 wiking	thoralf: ^
@lisitsyn	I looked into a few and they are just about code rewrite
@lisitsyn	that's not what we should do now
 thoralf	wiking: Thanks.
 wiking	lisitsyn: we should do it one day...
@lisitsyn	okay guys
@lisitsyn	NIPS application
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what help do you need?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I will write the abstract (1 page)
@lisitsyn	do you need help with reviewing it?
@HeikoS	you have to give me a nice webpage with notebooks and the cloud basic
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, and then I will send it to you guys for review
* iglesiasg re
@lisitsyn	who's on notebooks?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's cloud basic?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: they are more or less done, it would just be cool to have them on the webpage
@lisitsyn	how do you want to do that?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I want to include a cloud shogun link in the abstract
 wiking	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1590
@lisitsyn	ah so
@lisitsyn	ipython console
 wiking	lisitsyn: i've already created a small testbed for it... needs some extensions, but all in all we'll move to besser82's system as soon as it's ready
@lisitsyn	with shogun installed
@lisitsyn	right?
 wiking	lisitsyn: yesp
@lisitsyn	so it is like some job for wiking and besser82 again?
@lisitsyn	sorry ;)
@lisitsyn	okay then NIPS plan is
 wiking	lisitsyn: more for me now... we are still waiting for besser82 and fedora ppl to fix some stuff now on their system
@lisitsyn	Heiko writes abstract
@lisitsyn	we review it whether possible
 wiking	but a basic thing will be ready by weekend for HeikoS
@lisitsyn	wiking and besser82 collaborate on cloud stuff
 wiking	what i'll do is to add opencv as well to the image i created
@lisitsyn	is that it?
 wiking	so we can show the cool opencv demo that kevin created
@HeikoS	wiking: good, if that doesnt work, deadline is 7th or so so thats latest :)
 besser82	wiking: +1  :)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah that opencv thing will be a boig plus for the submission
 wiking	as one of the chairman of that workshop is a main opencv guy
@lisitsyn	haha yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: since the red line is "integrating different software"
 wiking	HeikoS: as well as that gerry whoever
 wiking	or what's his name is opencv guy ;P
@lisitsyn	garry bradski I think
 wiking	Gary Bradski
@lisitsyn	or gary
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	well
 wiking	"Gary Bradski is the Vice President of Computer Vision and Machine Learning, Magic Leap Inc. and President and CEO of OpenCV Foundation, which manages the development of the OpenCV machine learning and computer vision library"
@lisitsyn	I actually would like to see shogun replacing opencv's ml module :D
@lisitsyn	not possible though
 wiking	so if we do a demo with shogun+opencv i think that's big plus
@lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  you tried to compress the testsuite-dir from data and it is ~15 MBytes after compression  :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: have you ever used opencv's ml?
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah it's a shit
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  s/^you/I/
@lisitsyn	I wouldn't say API is something convenient
 wiking	lisitsyn: and some of their algos are classify only
 wiking	so it's really stupid...
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think we are not getting to something you want to push
@lisitsyn	now*
 wiking	indeed replacing opencv's ml would be great but i think that's really a long run...
@lisitsyn	that reminds me HeikoS wants funding ;)
 wiking	yeah funding would be great
 wiking	and here comes the question for
 wiking	HeikoS: and sonney2k
 wiking	what's the status of shogun fundation?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking I think its quite realistic to get that
@sonney2k	wiking, waiting for HeikoS to do sth
@HeikoS	however, I think we should do that after the release
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: do what?
 wiking	HeikoS: what's the status of fundation papers?
@HeikoS	ah sorry
 wiking	HeikoS: do u need some help?
@HeikoS	foundation will be done, no its easy
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, foundation 'satzung'
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	okay
 thoralf	wiking: The static list contains 101 errors - almost all of them are easy to fix (but to make sure we don't break anything last-minute, we should unit-test things first).
@HeikoS	but then, we should discuss these other things, what we want, how we do it etc.
@HeikoS	but I would do that later
 wiking	if it's tooo complicated to get it done in germany
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I think you promised 3 months ago
@HeikoS	and sorry for the delay on the foundation, also on top of my list
 thoralf	wiking: Can we fix the "Argument with 'nonnull'" errors by assert(var != NULL)?
@HeikoS	I know, gsoc came in between
@sonney2k	wiking, same like you with workshop video uploads
 wiking	we can choose another place for shogun fundation and have it done somewhere
 wiking	sonney2k: *nod*
@lisitsyn	phew it seems I escaped 'you promised' gun
 wiking	thoralf: i think so
@lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	foundation is not important before the release is done, so I will do it once all release stuff is solved
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay but what's about funding
@lisitsyn	how serious we are
@lisitsyn	and if we are how should we do that
@HeikoS	I would go for as serious as possible
@HeikoS	but after release
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm on it to get SHOGUN to publicity
@lisitsyn	well HeikoS I know
@HeikoS	I think we should aim for something like a GSoC which we found ourselves
@HeikoS	but like 3-times is a row
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so you wouldn't talk about it yet?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Already talked with some Heise && linux magazine guys  ;)
@lisitsyn	besser82: I have no idea what is it ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no I would wait a little
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I just wanted to may be discuss what exactly we should fund
@HeikoS	until we have the cloud, the notebooks on webpage, bugs solved, and heise stuff maybe
@HeikoS	ah I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: Heise is a BIG German "verlag" for IT focussed magazines  ;)
@lisitsyn	verlag verlag
@lisitsyn	publisher
@lisitsyn	I see
 wiking	besser82: is the rpm generator file/script is public already?
@HeikoS	so if we could find a person who is willing to work fulltime for us for say 1 year
 wiking	i mean can we include that in our repo?
@lisitsyn	besser82: I would have fun to write anything for them ;)
@HeikoS	that would be a good investment
@HeikoS	right?
@HeikoS	like gsoc but more involved
 besser82	lisitsyn: Sounds good  ;)
 wiking	HeikoS: i have the time ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: I was thinking about you ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, only if you upload the videos
 wiking	HeikoS: meaning i'm not booked up for anything serious till next september
 wiking	sonney2k: :DDD
 wiking	sonney2k: ayay captain!
 besser82	wiking:  the spec is avail: http://besser82.fedorapeople.org/review/shogun.spec  but not finished though...
@HeikoS	yeah, so if we could pay you for that, that would be amazing
 wiking	besser82: can we start including that in our repo?
 besser82	wiking: not yet
 besser82	wiking: will add that along cmake with autogeneration  ;)
 wiking	besser82: but we can update it later... i mean it's already in a 'working' state or?
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	then i guess it's after this weekend
@HeikoS	since you could a) push all new ideas wrt to cloud stuff b) polish some things on the fly
 besser82	wiking: right  ;)
 wiking	besser82: ok cool
@HeikoS	and then we could also focus a bit more on presentation
 wiking	looking forward for that cmake refurbish PR
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, but yeah, after release, I would do an own meeting for that, I can prepare things I have in mind etc
 wiking	ok so one more question
@sonney2k	guys can we do a little who does what for the release?
 wiking	demos
 besser82	wiking: it will be incredible  ;)
@sonney2k	I mean I will integrate notebooks and demose
 besser82	wiking: and huge   ;)
 wiking	where would the demos run?
@sonney2k	but there is 0 more I can do
@sonney2k	wiking, fatbot
 wiking	sonney2k: in that image?
@sonney2k	wiking, for example
 wiking	sonney2k: ok
@lisitsyn	I'll get to issues and try to manage resolving them
 wiking	sonney2k: then i'll prepare that
@sonney2k	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/waterfall
@lisitsyn	I mean I'll approach some issues by myself and bug other people to resolve issues assigned to them ;)
 wiking	sonney2k: nightly_all i know the last fix... so will be finished today
@sonney2k	I mean basically everyone who does not infrastructure should resolve issues the buildbot has / that are on github
@sonney2k	what I would suggest is not that you lisitsyn go through the issues
@sonney2k	but that everyone assigns himself to an issue
@sonney2k	or to multiple with some deadline
@HeikoS	sonney2k: would still be good if lisitsyn made an overview or priorities and categories of issues
 wiking	HeikoS: there's things like this with parameter.cpp as well:
@HeikoS	otherwise agreed
 wiking	/home/buildslave/clang34_-_undefined_behaviour_analysis/build/src/shogun/base/Parameter.cpp:2349:23: runtime error: member access within address 0x00000c25e4f8 which does not point to an object of type 'SGSparseVector<char>'
 wiking	0x00000c25e4f8: note: object is of type 'shogun::SGSparseVector<double>'
@HeikoS	wiking: is that in an issue?
 wiking	HeikoS: i'll check
@HeikoS	wiking: if not, assign to me, I will try to solve a few tomorrow and sunday
 wiking	HeikoS: if not i'll put it up
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well you can decide your own what is important right? So just do that stuff and yes we can tag things 'minor'
 wiking	actually what would be great is to get the buildbot all green if possible
 wiking	but that's a lot of work
@sonney2k	wiking, that is HeikoS hack for serialization
 wiking	so we might not have that
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah I second that, at least the basic ones
@HeikoS	what about the warning hunt?
@HeikoS	just on the fly?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I fixed them
@HeikoS	sonney2k: sweet!
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i think we have quite some schedule set up
 wiking	i guess it's going to be some discussions here anyways
 wiking	during the weekend
 wiking	so if any of you can plz stick around and join the bughunt
@HeikoS	oh one thing, lisitsyn I think we should aim for translating the shogun-tutorial stuff into notebooks on the long run, already did that for the MMD one
@sonney2k	HeikoS, iglesiasg - write notebook descriptions and push everyone else to do so if you cannot do them all
 wiking	lisitsyn: assigining is cool but i guess the common rule should be 'if u have time and want to fix a bug take one and fixit'
 wiking	:)
 wiking	and please
@lisitsyn	wiking: well my plan was to talk about issue with assignee
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, these descriptions will go directly to the website, right? Next to the links we have for the notebooks I guess
 wiking	if u are assigned to a bug then either work on it, but if u cannot just mention it in the issue comment that u cannot do it, so others know that is not being worked on
 wiking	iglesiasg: in the repo
@iglesiasg	wiking, all right. txt in the same dir as the ipynb with the same name
 wiking	iglesiasg: but i think if we find a way to generate a special html tag (html5 <abstract>) within the notebook, then we can have a simple parser that extracts that section of the notebook ;P
 wiking	iglesiasg: or even better: mark and abstract section in the notebook itself ;P
 wiking	iglesiasg: if u or anybody have a good idea for this how to do it
@iglesiasg	wiking, ok
 wiking	just make an example and mention it in an issue
 wiking	since json parsing is quite easy
 wiking	and then we just extract that json variable and we are all set
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes
 wiking	then the description of the notebook is self-included
 wiking	which would be better imo
@iglesiasg	wiking, it sounds neat like that yes
@iglesiasg	wiking, let's see if there is an easy way to make a special cell in the notebook for this
 wiking	btw guys
 wiking	HeikoS: especially: https://github.com/jakevdp/NIPS2013_sklearn
 wiking	have fun ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: ah thats cool
 wiking	and let's just beat them :P
@sonney2k	wiking, yes would be nice
@HeikoS	wiking: we will dont worry ;)
 thoralf	wiking: Where do I find information how to generate the static analysis?  So I can check if I fixed something...
@sonney2k	HeikoS, iglesiasg, wiking so what about having a mandatory 'abstract' as the first thing in a notebook?
 wiking	thoralf: either ask shogun-buildbot
@sonney2k	or wait for him :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yes that's the tihng
@HeikoS	sonney2k: up for that! author contacts included and short summary
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am searching if there is a way to mark a cell in the notebook
 wiking	thoralf: or if u  dont want to push it before then just: build cmake -D_HAS_CXX11_FLAG=OFF -D_HAS_CXX0X_FLAG=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DENABLE_CCACHE=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
@lisitsyn	does anyone have any other issues to discuss?
 wiking	thoralf: ok sorry so: scan-build cmake -D_HAS_CXX11_FLAG=OFF -D_HAS_CXX0X_FLAG=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DENABLE_CCACHE=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
 wiking	thoralf: scan-build -analyze-headers -o static_analysis --status-bugs make -j 2 -C build
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, how about I just use the first cell_type markdown?
 wiking	thoralf: u need clang installed
 thoralf	wiking: Okay, thanks.
 wiking	thoralf: note that it'll take quite some time to generate the output :S
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, easy enough
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if it is too long I can stop after say 1000 chars
@sonney2k	alright then
@iglesiasg	we just should write somewhere so that when someone writes a new notebook, keeps that in mind
 wiking	iglesiasg: a notebook template? :)
 wiking	iglesiasg: shogun notebook template and just make it somewhere available (either within repo or the website)
 thoralf	wiking: No worries.  Doing it on the fastest machine I can get. ;)
 wiking	thoralf: alrighty ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you please do such notebook template?
@iglesiasg	wiking, so this template is basically a notebook right?
@sonney2k	that would indeed be nice!
@iglesiasg	we save it as ipynb and that's all
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes with some title and a standard format
@sonney2k	yes
 wiking	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	I will do that
 wiking	iglesiasg: just add an issue for this then
@iglesiasg	latest this Sunday is ready (got a busy day tom)
@iglesiasg	sure
 wiking	cool
 wiking	thnx heaps!
@iglesiasg	no problem at all :)
@HeikoS	wiking, iglesiasg, sonney2k it will be easy to edit all notebooks and make them have the format once decided on that :)
@HeikoS	anything else to discuss?
@sonney2k	do work!
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Meeting-3
@lisitsyn	brief indeed but anything I missed?
 besser82	HeikoS, sonney2k: Would it be possible for me to get membership of "shogun-toolbox" on gh?
 besser82	HeikoS, sonney2k: So I can assign all build-sys related issues to me ?
@HeikoS	besser82: sure, I have no problem with that, ask sonney2k, he is the master ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: looks good, quite short mr lazy ;)
@HeikoS	I have to go now, see you all tomorrow!
 besser82	HeikoS: allrighty  ;) see you tomorrow then  ;)
* besser82 waves to HeikoS
@lisitsyn	see you
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I will fill in anythin else once I re-read logs
@HeikoS	ok :)
@HeikoS	bye!
