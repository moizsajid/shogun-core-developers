 sonne|work	blackburn: have you seen? I tried to file as much issues as I could think of
 sonne|work	so we can actually use issues to prioritize work...
 blackburn	sonne|work: I've closed one already
 blackburn	;)
 blackburn	actually I am going to close second one too
 sonne|work	yeah I have seen that
 blackburn	this evening I hope
 blackburn	sgstringlist one
 sonne|work	no complaints from my side :)
 blackburn	the only thing is that I have to change string features as well
 blackburn	in other case it double frees memory
 sonne|work	I guess that is a lot of work?
 blackburn	no, not at all
 sonne|work	ahh only converting stringfeatures to use SGStringList internally would be

 heiko1	i got a stupid c++ problem that is probably solvable in one second but I cannot see it current :)
 heiko1	here we go:
 heiko1	SGVector<float64_t>* new_values=SG_MALLOC(SGVector<float64_t>, 1);
 heiko1	SGVector<float64_t> temp();
 heiko1	*new_values=temp;
 heiko1	why does this not compile?
 blackburn	what is the error?
 heiko1	invalid conversion from >>shogun::SGVector<double> (*)()<< to >>int<< [-fpermissive
