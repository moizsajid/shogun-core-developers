@sonney2k	heiko2, about kernel diagonal precomputation
 heiko2	sonnyes, yes?
@sonney2k	shouldn't we add some more general code for that?
 heiko2	preallocation you mean
 heiko2	?
@sonney2k	ohh no idea what you mean by that?
@sonney2k	I meant some array to store k(x_i,x_i)
 heiko2	ehm
 heiko2	confused, what do you mean?
 heiko2	this method compute_diagonal of CKernel?
@sonney2k	some kernels need to compute k(x_i,x_i) upon init()
@sonney2k	yes
 heiko2	so?
@sonney2k	it may be expensive ... so storing the precomputed stuff might be worth it
 heiko2	I see, so a getter for the array?
 blackburn	discussion! I'm in!
 heiko2	sonney2k, agreed, storing that would be good, but in my case I call the compute_diagonal method after re-setting features
@sonney2k	heiko2, no a general way of doing this
@sonney2k	I mean inside of CKernel maybe even
@sonney2k	blackburn, hey there!
 blackburn	hey
 heiko2	blackburn, hi!
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko2: gunnar was just visiting
 blackburn	berlin?
@sonney2k	so he asked about the workshope
@sonney2k	*shop
@sonney2k	blackburn, myself
@sonney2k	yes physically!
 heiko2	any plans for the workshop already?
 heiko2	I think it would be cool to do this
 heiko2	but the bio conference might be a bit strange, since one would have to pay to get there
@sonney2k	heiko2, yeah concrete plans
@sonney2k	we could try to do it at c-base
 blackburn	so you have concrete plans?
 blackburn	wat is da c-base?
 heiko2	yeah I liked the c-base idea
@sonney2k	http://c-base.org/
 blackburn	are you kidding? it is full deutsch :D
 blackburn	so some association
 heiko2	blackburn, itblackburn
 heiko2	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-base
@sonney2k	on july 12
 heiko2	so you got a date wow
@sonney2k	so single day (friday)
 heiko2	did you book already?
@sonney2k	heiko2, no
 heiko2	what is the intended audience?
 heiko2	academics from berlin?=
@sonney2k	I am not around afterwards so it is the only possible date that could benefit from ismb-closeness
 heiko2	I see
 heiko2	weekday could be a problem for people, since you would have to take annual leave days for that if you are coming from outside
 heiko2	what do you think, how many people from berlin would come?
@sonney2k	heiko2, I have absolutely no idea
@sonney2k	heiko2, I know... but no idea how to do it better
 blackburn	I think I should be able to visit
@sonney2k	only thing would be to do it as 2-day workshop with someone else continuing on saturday
 heiko2	I see, maybe one day first, since we dont know how many people would attend
@sonney2k	heiko2, and we could start a bit late on friday so that people could just arrive friday
@sonney2k	say 11 am
 heiko2	sonney2k, good idea
@sonney2k	until 8pm
 heiko2	sonney2k, I mean to be realistic, probably only the TUB people will make it
 heiko2	we could do a video stream maybe
 blackburn	can you please explain what it would look like?
 blackburn	a lot of people at one place
 blackburn	...
 blackburn	profit
 blackburn	what is in between? :)
 heiko2	hehe blackburn ;)
 heiko2	step1 collect socks .... step 3 profit :D
 blackburn	exact;y
 heiko2	there could be some presentations of stuff that is possible with shogun
 blackburn	right
 heiko2	there could be a Q&A with all the developers about challenges
 heiko2	maybe some python people are also around so we could discuss stuff with them
 heiko2	and maybe even some tasks to be solved by people with shogun
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: zxtx
 heiko2	like "take this data and solve that problem"
 blackburn	sounds good
 heiko2	and an introduction to shogun hacking maybe?
-!- Netsplit over, joins: zxtx
 heiko2	for people interested in joining
 heiko2	maybe interesting for potential gsoc students
 heiko2	a mrs shogun contest ;)
 heiko2	miss shogun
 blackburn	yeah good
 heiko2	a blackburn lookalike contest
 heiko2	you doing a fight with a bear
 heiko2	etc etc
 heiko2	installation tutorial (thats quite a burden for many people I know)
 heiko2	documentation sprint
 blackburn	hah yes that one with bear should be most interesting
 heiko2	there is so much one could do
 heiko2	maybe two days would be cooler
 heiko2	but the thing is always attendance
 heiko2	shogun users are quite spread out
 blackburn	okay so yes it sounds cool and I think I should go if I don't get hit by a bus
 heiko2	even from t?bingen to berlin is a very long trip
 heiko2	why would you get hit by a bus?
 blackburn	well at least we can get drunk http://25.media.tumblr.com/cd57f5f7c4945948ff9453f2ff26e982/tumblr_meoedrvjHs1rml2rmo3_250.png
 blackburn	that damn bayes said that I have a chance
 heiko2	yeah, thats always one possibility, and berlin got lots to offer on a friday night
 blackburn	can we get drunk and ride a tram?
 heiko2	lol, yes thats technically possibly
 heiko2	possible
 blackburn	no questions left
 heiko2	hehe :)
 heiko2	we should start a google doc with a brainstorming to collect ideas and thoughts
 heiko2	I gotta eat cake now, see you tomorrow or so!
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	great holiday for me tomorrow
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	did you all had a merry christmas btw?
 blackburn	I had a terrible overloaded last week
@sonney2k	heiko2, blackburn so let me ask the c-base guys if we could do the WS at their place
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	once that is settled I think we should do the discussion in public
-!- heiko2 [~heiko@host86-177-178-164.range86-177.btcentralplus.com] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	blackburn, I just asked in #c-base - and got pretty positive feedback
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	lets hope they still have room for us and that the 'crew' is positive too
 blackburn	is it so hard to get a room?
@sonney2k	blackburn, there might be another event already...
@sonney2k	on that day
 blackburn	so it is kind of dense schedule they have there/
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	and c-base basically only has a seminar room (small) and the 'main' hall which is not that big
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	but certainly enough for ~100 people
@sonney2k	though I would expect that we won't have more than 50
 blackburn	we won't get 100 :D
@sonney2k	well we couple it with ISMB
@sonney2k	so we for sure have 10 form there
@sonney2k	from
@sonney2k	heiko broke the build
@sonney2k	SystemError: [1;31m[ERROR][0m GaussianKernel::get_kernel_diagonal(): Preallocated vector has wrong size!
 blackburn	hah
@sonney2k	wiking_, your ubu1 - libshogun buildslave is down
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you read my message in jabber? funny thing happened :D
 blackburn	yesterday
@sonney2k	no haven't seen it
 blackburn	my ML lections were kinda stolen
@sonney2k	your what?
 blackburn	remember I tried to lecture people?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	2 years ago
@sonney2k	vaguely
 blackburn	well slides are posted on machinelearning.ru
@sonney2k	cool
 blackburn	so one guy just stole it and posted on habrahabr.ru (some russian kind of reddit may be)
 blackburn	sonney2k: no reference, stolen pics and text
 blackburn	I am glad and bothered at the same time - somebody thought it is ok (glad) but he stole it totally (bothered) :D
@sonney2k	no references is not ok of course :/
 blackburn	at least he could ask me, I don't know
@sonney2k	wiking_, your buildslave: bsd1 - libshogun is down too!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I should add wiking_ to the list of pain
@sonney2k	aka buildbot emails
 blackburn	hehe
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I changed buildslave memory limit to 3.5GB
@sonney2k	for building shogun...
@sonney2k	now it works OK again
 blackburn	I've seen that in logs
@sonney2k	it is a bit too much for my taste...
@sonney2k	*sigh*
 blackburn	3.5 gb you mean?
 blackburn	exactly
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, back to workshop: so lets say we get 10 from ISMB, 10-20 random people and about 10 developers
 blackburn	yeah I think so
@sonney2k	note that some people from TU berlin and other ML research groups here might join aswell
@sonney2k	especially since it is for free
@sonney2k	I mean attendence

@sonney2k	heiko, you broke the build...
 heiko	sonney2k, oh, I didnt realise, sory
 heiko	let me check
 heiko	sonney2k, the modular tests?
 heiko	strange, working here
 heiko	sonney2k, is the buildbot running without lapack or something else different to usual? The test runs fine here will the same code as in git
