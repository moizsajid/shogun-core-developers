 AndreLopes	Does anyone knows if shogun for java works fine?
 AndreLopes	on ubuntu*
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@122.178.206.223] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
@wiking	AndreLopes: i've used it
@wiking	extensively
@wiking	and had no troubles
 AndreLopes	does the java code has comments? i mean javadoc
 sonne|work	lisitsyn, wiking - could any of you setup a wiki page (google doc? github) for collecting ideas again?
-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@182.70.218.78] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I think that is the best way to make any progress here.
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yeah
@lisitsyn	I am a bit lost about mentors
 sonne|work	meetings are rather wasteful...

@lisitsyn	I hope Heiko and Fernando talked to someone
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	oh HeikoS hey
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yeah that is the biggest issue.
@wiking	AndreLopes: lets continue here
@wiking	so no we currently do not generate javadoc at all :<
@wiking	i think this should be handled on swig level
 AndreLopes	well
@wiking	dunno if they've merged anything concerning this
 AndreLopes	im starting to use shogun now
 AndreLopes	any ideas how can i get familiar with the classes and code?
 AndreLopes	is there any documentation or book ?
@lisitsyn	examples and headers :D
 sonne|work	AndreLopes: http://sgtb.eu/doc/en/current/
@wiking	yeah i'm just preparing the docset for dash
@wiking	(http://kapeli.com/dash)
@wiking	but its only for c++ api
@wiking	lisitsyn: if u dont know that app u should most def download
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: H
@HeikoS	i
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh finally someone did that
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah it's super great that i dont have to google for an api call every timw
@lisitsyn	ohh finally

@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	google knows all the code I have
@lisitsyn	e.g. I can't keep stl in mind
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	:)
@wiking	dash
 AndreLopes	So guys im a bit confused now
 AndreLopes	I have little knowledge on C++
 AndreLopes	my main language is java.
 AndreLopes	Without javadoc or documentation, im not sure how to start coding
@wiking	AndreLopes: there's almost a 1-1 mapping between java class names and the c++ class names
@wiking	the only thing you need to do is to remove the C prefix
@wiking	i.e.
@wiking	CSVM -> SVM
@wiking	CFeatures -> Features
 AndreLopes	hm
 AndreLopes	What about examples and documentations?
@wiking	AndreLopes: there are quite some examples under the examples dir
 AndreLopes	even in java?
@wiking	see shogun/examples/undocumented/java_modular
@wiking	there are 123 files in that directory
 AndreLopes	So its possible right?
@wiking	well check those java examples
@wiking	you'lll get the basics from there for sure
 AndreLopes	Im picking shogun for my master degree project, sorry for so many questions
 AndreLopes	but i really must be sure
@wiking	nw
@wiking	classifier_knn_modular.java
@wiking	this files shows u how to do knn in java

 AndreLopes	alright
 AndreLopes	Hm, well i guess people in IRC can give me a hand if i get stuck right ?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	adn mailing list
 AndreLopes	adn?
@wiking	*and
 AndreLopes	Oh ok
 AndreLopes	1 more question if you dont mind :P
 AndreLopes	I most learned about neural networks with encog books from Jeff Heaton
 AndreLopes	ABout SVM and other topics.. what do you recommend me ?
 AndreLopes	Especially for shogun environment-focused
 AndreLopes	:(
@wiking	:<
 AndreLopes	I will search for a good AI book i guess
 AndreLopes	Did you use any ?
