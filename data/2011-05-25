 Daniel	Hi Sonney
 Daniel	I got my CSharp typemaps to compile all the way through - although I am still getting some warnings off missing typemaps.
 Daniel	I have a question
 Daniel	Structure.i:64: Warning(453): Can't apply (int32_t *IN_ARRAY2,int32_t DIM1,int32_t DIM2). No typemaps are defined.
 Daniel	This seems to apply to a double array since there are two dimmension variables, but why is there only one pointer to *IN_ARRAY2
 Daniel	I would have expected **IN_ARRAY2
 Daniel	I have added my code to the GitHub

 serialhex	blackburn: hey, how are ya?
 blackburn	serialhex: hey, nice, and you?
 serialhex	pretty good, wondering why i cant load up any of the shogun modules in ruby, and trying to fix it :-/
 blackburn	ruby-shoguning
 serialhex	yes indeed :D
 serialhex	FFS!!!  doing it manually i can get swig the bindings to work, but the auto-makefile way doesnt :-/
* blackburn is very tired for some unknown reason
 serialhex	take a short nap, ~90min or so and you should fel better (or dose yourself up on a bunch of caffiene, which i'm about to do)
 blackburn	not good time for a nap - 23-42 :D
 serialhex	ahh, ok :P  that might be why you are tired
 blackburn	yeah, some kind of reason to be tired
* sonney2k wakes up
@sonney2k	did I miss anything?
 blackburn	sonney2k:  some msgs from Daniel
 blackburn	and the end of the world but it doesn't matter
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh indeed - welcome to the end of the world ...
@sonney2k	... of warcraft or so :D
@bettyboo	8)
 blackburn	oh my room-neighbor likes warcraft pretty much I think
@sonney2k	I hope someone here has seen the southpark WoW episode
* sonney2k never played it
 blackburn	me too
 blackburn	or he is playing other kind of shit
@sonney2k	and now it seems I won't have time for the next decade
 blackburn	it is better for you anyway
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know - fun is sth important in live :)
@bettyboo	sonney2k, <:*)
@sonney2k	blackburn, when you have time watch the southpark episode Make Love, Not Warcraft
@sonney2k	it is *great*
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think I have seen it
 blackburn	just do not remember exactly
 blackburn	sonney2k: fun is important indeed but not fun from warcraft :D
 blackburn	oh damn how I hate these faggot games
 serialhex	WOW is pretty fun, tho i havnt played in years...
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw the last season of south park is great at all
 blackburn	I have been playing Ultima Online for a while
 blackburn	what a sadly fact :D
* serialhex has no time for games :(
@sonney2k	nowadays I am mostly playing shogun ;-)
@sonney2k	wow - 4 pull requests
 serialhex	yeah
* sonney2k reads the diffs
 serialhex	i have some Q's for you sonney2k when you have a moment
 blackburn	there won't be any pull request from me for a while :D I have a cleanroom for my dimreduction things
 blackburn	where is frx ?
 blackburn	don't remember his irc nick
 CIA-31	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * r0156394 / src/java_modular/swig_typemaps.i : fix new SGTYPE() issue for java (+5 more commits...) - http://bit.ly/lDz6dm
@sonney2k	serialhex, why did you git add data ?
@sonney2k	+Subproject commit f499261f24471928b916bf066d018d995bcaccd9
@sonney2k	serialhex, please revert that and I merge your patch
 serialhex	i wasnt sure why that was there... it didnt make sense (maybe it was an accident when i was "git commit -a"-ing)
@sonney2k	blackburn, who or where?
 blackburn	sonney2k: where, haven't seen him for a week or so, do you?
@sonney2k	serialhex, can you please copy your current configure then do a git reset --hard to the version before you had the patch and then add your patch?
 serialhex	ok sonney2k, will do!
@sonney2k	serialhex, then IIRC you can do git push --force to force this push
@sonney2k	blackburn, he had some project work deadline today
@sonney2k	blackburn, so he will hopefully be active very soon
 blackburn	hehe
 serialhex	qgit
 serialhex	ffs! wrong window :P
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw Daniel has done c# typemaps for matrix and vector it seems
@sonney2k	based on sploving's
 blackburn	sonney2k: some non-gsoc activity is good :)
 CIA-31	shogun: dmkorn master * rbdcddac / src/csharp_modular/swig_typemaps.i : This is still not complete, more typemaps need to be written and run time testing needs to be performed. However, this compiles through with no errors. - http://bit.ly/jMdOLK
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * re3e7978 / src/csharp_modular/swig_typemaps.i : Merge branch 'patch-1' of git://github.com/dmkorn/shogun - http://bit.ly/jMRUha
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes that is just increadibly good news!
 blackburn	sonney2k: but anyway I'm worried about where are this hindu guy ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand
 blackburn	nevermind :)
@bettyboo	lol
@sonney2k	I am not so worried... he is writing emails more or less regularly
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I just thought he is disappeared
@sonney2k	I only hope that that we will soon have some online features :)
 blackburn	I don't know what it is and why we need it so I'd rather go in bed
 blackburn	have a nice time/sleep/anything :)
 blackburn	see you

@sonney2k	cu...
 serialhex	sonney2k: done!  you should see it now
* serialhex has to figure out why data wants to change each time now :-/
 CIA-31	shogun: Justin Patera master * r355fd30 / src/configure : updated configure script to work with ruby 1.8 & 1.9 - http://bit.ly/l252NB
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r02cc0f9 / src/configure : Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/serialhex/shogun - http://bit.ly/jA2oKf
 serialhex	YAY!!  that's me!!! :P
 serialhex	so do you have a min sonney2k, or is it stupid-late there?? (i switched to xfce instead of kde and now i dont have a timezone widget :( )
@sonney2k	serialhex, everone's asleep so timeing is god
@sonney2k	good
 serialhex	ok, so for some reason when i try to load any of the shogun modules in ruby they wont load... i've done some testing with the simple example on the swig site and it works (either manually or w/ mkmf) but loading the modules dosnt work
 serialhex	my guess is that the modules are all in caps and ruby expects them to be lowercase, do module Foo would need to be require 'foo'
 serialhex	i.e. running irb in the src/ruby_module dir:
 serialhex	>> require './regression'
 serialhex	LoadError: no such file to load -- ./regression
 serialhex	> require './Regression'
 serialhex	LoadError: libshogun.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - ./Regression.so
 serialhex	are the errors i get when trying to load that, when i shouldnt be getting any such errors :-/
 serialhex	so any spiffy programatic ways to %module All_the_shogun_modules ??  or should i simply add them all by hand or something?
@sonney2k	serialhex, I don't understand - is the .so file in the path?
 serialhex	yeah
@sonney2k	don't you usually do require 'Regression'
@sonney2k	I mean without the ./ ?
 serialhex	yeah, but since the make install script dosnt throw them into the proper dirs yet i add the ./  while in the dir so it picks it up
 serialhex	and it's usu require 'regression'  or whatever
@sonney2k	serialhex, isn't there some RUBY_PATH or so variable for ruby such that it can find the extension?
 serialhex	i believe so i can't remember what it is off the top of my head, but like when i make my own stuff for testing i simply do a require './foo' which works
@sonney2k	serialhex, you could try to add LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
@sonney2k	with path to this dir
@sonney2k	but I think for .so extensions you need to do things differntly
 serialhex	in the configure script?
 serialhex	i had no trouble doing things that way with the swig example
 serialhex	Welcome to IRB. You are using ruby 1.8.7 (2011-02-18 patchlevel 334) [i686-linux]. Have fun ;)
 serialhex	>> require './example' #=> true
 serialhex	>> Example::fact(5) #=> 120
 serialhex	that's the spiffy example off their site, so it seems it dosnt matter if it's a .so or .rb it should pick it up either way
* serialhex needs a faster computer
@sonney2k	I am not a ruby expert - so I am afraid I cannot really help here.
 serialhex	ok, i'll do more research & see what i can find
 serialhex	tho i think i might have to do some name-switching & stuff... esp since 'kernel' is part of the base ruby object system (in fact it's a module that's mixed into object & prettymuch inseperable from it)
 serialhex	i think maybe adding SG before the modules wouldnt hurt, tho it's kind of wonky imo... but that's the price one pays for having one word with multiple meanings :P
* serialhex is thinking of overclocking his 3ghz p4 to a 10ghz p4 with some liquid nitrogen cooling... he just needs to find some liquid nitrogen
