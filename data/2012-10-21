 shogun-buildbot	build #567 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/567  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>

 wiking	sonne_: i think i've solved the problem how to have modular interfaces tested on travis and not running out of the hard deadline of 25 minutes
 wiking	sonne_: we'll just fire up for each interface a separate travis instance
 wiking	and then we should be safe :P
 shogun-buildbot	build #459 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/459  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 sonne_	wiking, that would be cool
 wiking	how do we want to include gmock/gtest into shogun? :)
 sonne_	wiking, well it should be autodetected of course
 sonne_	and then typing just make will run tests for the file
 sonne_	s
 wiking	no i mean the thing is now
 wiking	that as they say
 wiking	we should compile ourselves in our project
 wiking	gtest/gmock
 wiking	https://groups.google.com/group/googletestframework/tree/browse_frm/thread/668eff1cebf5309d/f7787f381a418617?hide_quotes=no
 sonne_	wiking, yes we should
 wiking	so how we're going to do that
 wiking	i guess another submodule? :)
 sonne_	wiking, hmmhh no
 sonne_	wiking, the gmock/gtest stuff should still be in a debian package
 sonne_	but you compile their code and link appropriately
 sonne_	w/shogun

 sonne_	heiko1, hey hey!
 heiko1	sonne_ hey :)
 heiko1	how is it going?
 wiking	sonne_: u mean to get the source of the package via he package system?
 sonne_	heiko1, any thoughts about doing the doc sprint?
 sonne_	wiking, no
 sonne_	wiking, the source is in the package
 wiking	is it?
 heiko1	sonne_ I would love to do that actually :) Arthur suggested to combine it with the NIPS somehow, but I havent checked the dates yet
 sonne_	yes
 sonne_	heiko1, most important for now is to decide whether we want to apply
 sonne_	(we have just this week until the application deadline)
 heiko1	sonne_ ok, will check that out now, just returned home. As I said, I would love to go. Gotta check out with my new job, but I think that will work
 heiko1	what are the chances of being accepted?
 sonne_	heiko1, no idea...
 shogun-buildbot	build #568 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/568  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	sonne_: this one only has the headers: http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/google-mock
 sonne_	I talked to carol but no clue
 sonne_	wiking, that is an old package then :/
 sonne_	can you grab a newer one?
 sonne_	from debian or so?
 heiko1	ok, lets just apply, but let me check the dates first, Just got a phone call, will be back in 15 mins
 wiking	sonne_: no i was wront this one actually has the libgmock.so as well :)
 wiking	http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/i386/google-mock/filelist
 wiking	:)
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	so gmock has it
 wiking	i mean the library
 wiking	but gtest not
 wiking	http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/amd64/libgtest-dev/filelist
 wiking	and it has the sources
 sonne_	wiking, please check packages.debian.org
 sonne_	but search for gtest only
 sonne_	could be that it got renamed
 wiking	ok
 sonne_	alright I have to go to a talk now
 wiking	debian experimental has the right
 wiking	format
 wiking	i mean content

@sonney2k	wiking, I am on the machine w/ access now
@sonney2k	wiking, so lemme check the bb
 blackburn	sonney2k: is chris with you?
 blackburn	I mean at the summit
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	setting next to me
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	wiking, did you point the bb to shogun-toolbox org?
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	sonney2k: kick him!
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	he looks very relaxed
@sonney2k	listening to the science session
 blackburn	kick! relaxed is not allowed at the science session
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	wiking, bc it says it is offline http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	heiko1, one thing - are you working on the buildbot failure?
@sonney2k	heiko1, we should really get everything back to green asap
 heiko1	sonney2k, yes will be solved soon, its due to changes in the streaming
@sonney2k	otherwise we run into trouble with new commits (bugs slipping through..)
@sonney2k	thx, the sooner the better
 heiko1	sonney2k, I got a job interview on tuesday, then I can ask if I could go to the doc summit (which is parallel to NIPS), since its in Uni, I dont think there will be problems with that
 heiko1	one thing is: I would love to go to NIPS, but its 220 miles from mountain view, so no idea how probable that is - also then I cannot write docs.
 heiko1	but doint only one of the things is also fine
 blackburn	what a bad coincidence
@sonney2k	heiko1, so your paper got accepted? congrats!
 heiko1	blackburn, yeah, would be better if these things were one after another, then I could attend both :)
 heiko1	sonney2k, yes :) thanks
 heiko1	sonney2k, do origanisations and individuals have to apply separately for the doc summit?
@sonney2k	no just as a group we can apply
@sonney2k	but we need some critical mass ~4 people
 blackburn	sonney2k: ask chris whether he likes that
@sonney2k	blackburn, likes what?
@sonney2k	writing docs?
 blackburn	yes
 heiko1	sonney2k, just read everything, sounds great!
 heiko1	lets do it!
 heiko1	We can recylce the proposal I wrote for the GSoC
 heiko1	and I can write stuff for ModelSelection since MMD stuff is pretty complete documented (except for streaming) But I am also fine with documenting the other GSoC projects
 heiko1	meeting the others is also awesome
 heiko1	blackburn, you should also come :)
 blackburn	heiko1: I am thinking about that
 heiko1	would be cool to meet in real :)
@sonney2k	heiko1, who else could potentially come?
 heiko1	sonney2k, you mean which GSoC student?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	heiko1: I have potential passport- and visa-wise troubles
 heiko1	well obsously the GP guy, he is in the area already
 heiko1	jacob walker
 heiko1	and fernando probably is also interested
@sonney2k	chiyuan too?
 heiko1	gsomix since he did all these great changes
 heiko1	actually - everybody :)
 blackburn	gsomix would have same problems as me :)
@sonney2k	well everyone that could  write some substantial amount of doc
 heiko1	who wrote during the gsoc?
 heiko1	blackburn, chiyuan and me right?
@sonney2k	only you and blackbrun and chiyuan
@sonney2k	yeah
 heiko1	well, then us three at least
@sonney2k	so you + fernando maybe?
 heiko1	yeah
 blackburn	btw there is a Pascal Harvest programme that could be similar thing as that doc sprint
 heiko1	who did reply to your mail?
@sonney2k	no one
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not in pascal...
 heiko1	ok its already late and saturday :)
 heiko1	sonney2k, people should be interested in it
 blackburn	sonney2k: does that matter for that programme?
@sonney2k	just afternoon here
 heiko1	well, not here :)
@sonney2k	heiko1, isn't arthur in pascal?
 heiko1	I think yes
 heiko1	Ehm, I did not get why you ask :)
 heiko1	is there a similar thing going on in there?
 blackburn	it is 30-90 days physical co-location
 blackburn	heiko1: http://www.pascal-network.org/?q=node/19
@sonney2k	but for pascal members only or?
 blackburn	I didn't see such restriction but may be I just missed
 heiko1	blackburn, ah nice one
 heiko1	but that is more docussed on software development
 blackburn	well, yes
 heiko1	so implement a recent paper into shogun
 heiko1	sounds fun! :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please fix up the doc page?
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's wrong?
@sonney2k	blackburn, err contacts page
@sonney2k	move mailinglist first
@sonney2k	then irc
 blackburn	yeah I will tomorrow
@sonney2k	kthx
 heiko1	30-90 days
 heiko1	blackburn, sonney2k, this might be quite cool for next spring (at least for me)
 heiko1	but people need to be at the same place
 blackburn	heiko1: well is that a problem?
 heiko1	blackburn, well yeah do you think they will fund accomondation?
 heiko1	and where?
 heiko1	and 4-8 persons
 blackburn	yes that's the thing they fund
 heiko1	I see
 heiko1	wow
 heiko1	amazing
 blackburn	The execution phase should take place in the European Union, or in a country hosting a PASCAL 2 member. Participants who are not normally located where the execution takes place will be refunded a return flight in economy class from the place where they live, and will be entitled to a per-diem for accommodation, meals and local travel. 
 heiko1	then we should go for London
 heiko1	there are many Pascal members around here
 heiko1	I could ask John-Shawe Taylor :)
 heiko1	he would probably agree
 heiko1	and then implement some new cool stuff into shogun
 heiko1	like Kernel belief propagation
 heiko1	or integrate graphlab into shogun :D
 blackburn	anyway that seems to be prospective
 blackburn	however last time I said that I want to participate in such programme my gf was running for me with an axe trying to kill me
 heiko1	blackburn, hahaha :)
 heiko1	man its just 1 month
 blackburn	or to be serious she didn't like that :D
 heiko1	or maybe 3 :)
 heiko1	take her with you
 heiko1	everynbody like London
 blackburn	we will just spend all the money for vodka
 blackburn	heiko1: will we?
 heiko1	or maybe we could do it in Germany, e.g. in Berlin
 heiko1	Berlin is even nicer than London
 blackburn	lets do it in Bryansk!
 heiko1	are there any scientists over there? :D
 blackburn	in bryansk?
 heiko1	Vodka is pretty expensive here btw
 blackburn	oh.. may be
 blackburn	or rather minsk
 blackburn	lets move to minsk
 blackburn	(belarus)
 blackburn	our code will be reviewed by KGB then
 blackburn	heiko1: we will produce some vodka by ourselves, not a problem
 heiko1	blackburn, LOL :)
 blackburn	heiko1: the reason I am not sure I am able to come is that I have to get two documents
 blackburn	foreign passport and usa visa
 blackburn	and they both require not really less than two weeks
 blackburn	and the 1 is required for the 2
 heiko1	I see
 blackburn	heiko1: we have two passports :D
 heiko1	a damn, I dont have a passport, so I would have to go to Germany before
 blackburn	one is internal and one is foreign
 blackburn	I don't know what the heck was in minds when they decided to do it this way
 heiko1	no idea
 blackburn	heiko1: how can that be? is there anything that identifies you?
 heiko1	blackburn, yes my German ID
 heiko1	ID card
 heiko1	but thats a different thing than a passport
 blackburn	hmm no idea what is it
 blackburn	but we have no ID cards here
 heiko1	I always get a temporary passport when I travel since being lazy, I should get a passport in any way
 blackburn	or everybody except me has
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	heiko1: you don't have to get visa, right?
 heiko1	for the US?
 heiko1	no idea
 blackburn	yeah you don't have to
 blackburn	heiko1: I would have to ask for a visa then talk to a councillor and then wait for the decision :D
 heiko1	pretty short-notice since all this stuff is in December
 blackburn	and furthermore pay 180$ for that thing
 blackburn	with probability of being rejected
 blackburn	nice to live in third-world country :D
 heiko1	phew
 heiko1	man
 heiko1	you should come to Europe :)
 blackburn	okay enough laments I have to sleep :D
 blackburn	heiko1: I'd need the same thing for europe :D
 heiko1	man
 heiko1	but there are so many Russians here
 blackburn	yes sure
 heiko1	I fighted against one in boxing training today :D
 blackburn	I heard that before :) was he like a bear?
 heiko1	actually
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	pretty scary that guy
 heiko1	 :)
 heiko1	My size, but 20 kilos more weight :D
 heiko1	(which is not hard)
 blackburn	yeah I remember you are tall and skinny :)
 heiko1	yes
 blackburn	I am a full opposite being 175cm tall :)
 heiko1	but I am fast and have long arms and legs, that helps
 heiko1	damn, I definitely need that passport, I will apply for one on monday, hope I get an appointment
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	good thing my story wasn't useless, at least it recalled you to take the passport
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	annoying these things
 heiko1	since I can only get a passport when I have an ID
 heiko1	I dont get why this is necessary
 heiko1	oh man,
 heiko1	shit, this is pretty short notice everything :(
 heiko1	I dont know if this will work out
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I planned to get foreign passport this or next month
 blackburn	if I had it already all I'd need is to get visa
 heiko1	I will call the embassy on Monday
 heiko1	if not, I might just fly to Germany to do this
 blackburn	okay sleep time
 blackburn	heiko1: see you
 heiko1	blackburn, good night!
 blackburn	sonney2k: see you don't get asleep at all these talks and kick chris
 blackburn	sonney2k: and do not forget to vodka

@sonney2k	n4nd0, would you join heiko, blackburn to participate in the code sprint at googleplex beginning of december?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it sounds like a great idea, I'd love it
 n4nd0	let me check the exact dates
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we have to apply by IIRC Oct 25 so the sooner we know the better....
 n4nd0	3-7 December sounds good
 n4nd0	sonney2k: and you said google pays housing so we have to take care of the plane and the other expenses there right?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, check the email... one can apply for travel funding

 wiking	fuuuuuckiiiing heeeellll
@sonney2k	wiking, what?

@sonney2k	organization applies
@sonney2k	if accepted we request travel support

@sonney2k	yeah as many as possible
 n4nd0	who is in so far?
@sonney2k	heiko,you,wiking,blackburn
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how are we going to prepare the application?
@sonney2k	I am asking chiyuan

 n4nd0	it's looking good I think
 n4nd0	the order of the dates looks a little bit odd to me, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclogs/
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what is wrong with it?
@sonney2k	(I am currently writing a calendar widget for that though)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ahh and http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun
@sonney2k	we have planet shogun now on the main site
@sonney2k	(former weblog)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so there appears first some dates from 2012, later from 2011, later from 2012 again, etc
 n4nd0	dinner time, I'll be back later
-!- n4nd0 is now known as n4nd0_away

-!- n4nd0_away is now known as n4nd0
 n4nd0	re
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, now it is ordered :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but as I said I am writing some calendar widget - that will improve it a lot
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	it sounds like a nice idea
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you have a showcase to see how it will look like?
@sonney2k	I am currently extending developer resources http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/dev/firststeps
@sonney2k	n4nd0, feel free to continue there
@sonney2k	n4nd0, thanks to winking we have some new buildbots in there :D
@sonney2k	static code analysis
@sonney2k	and travid
@sonney2k	s
 n4nd0	travids?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and in case you have seen http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun - I've integrated the blog posts of you all on the main page reformatting things
@sonney2k	n4nd0, travis
@sonney2k	n4nd0, whenever you do a github PR it will build your commit and run tests
@sonney2k	so we know before merge if you break anything
 n4nd0	oh yeah, wiking showed me
@sonney2k	the webpage still needs some improvement but it is getting useful
@sonney2k	once done we can finally write/post the blog post

 wiking	blackburn: yELP
 blackburn	wiking: what's up?
 wiking	blackburn: dotfeatures
 wiking	need the feature vectors
 blackburn	dense?
 wiking	well that's the problem
 wiking	i shouldn't suppose that it's dense :D
 wiking	it could be sparse
 blackburn	when it shouldn't be dense feature
 blackburn	s
 blackburn	dot features I mean
 wiking	but if i want to support both: sparse/dense features?
 wiking	that's the only way i can do it :)
 wiking	or?
 blackburn	wiking: then you've got to assume model is dense
 blackburn	it is even if you work with sparse, right?
 blackburn	by mdoel I mean w
 blackburn	band b
 blackburn	and b
 wiking	but it could be that my features are sparse
 wiking	so why would i want to waste memory on a densefeatures object
 blackburn	features could be sparse but model is dense
 wiking	if my features are sparse
 wiking	this is really regardless of my model
 wiking	i have features
 wiking	that could be both sparse or dense
 blackburn	but still - do you really need to have feature vector?
 wiking	well the problem is that i have feature vectors cached
 wiking	in a dotfeatures object
 wiking	but i have to have reference at one point on a given feature within that cache
 blackburn	cachhed?
 blackburn	how?
 wiking	precalculated
 blackburn	I am not sure I understood you
 blackburn	wiking: so what do you exactly need?
 wiking	ife
 wiking	life
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	:D
