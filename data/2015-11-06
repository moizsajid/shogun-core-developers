@wiking	 woah buildbot was down :(
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@05453a05.skybroadband.com] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey again
 lisitsyn	sup?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	jojo
@HeikoS	all good?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeap
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hope to do some stuff @ nips
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah me too!
@HeikoS	Wu will come too
 lisitsyn	well if everything goes ok with visa and stuff
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	come to the big monte carlo workshop!
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I've been studying mcmc lately a bit
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	and?
 lisitsyn	sounds very cool
 lisitsyn	have you seen that bayesian methods for hackers book?
 lisitsyn	it actually almost converted me to bayesian
 lisitsyn	like another religion haha
@HeikoS	yeah I know this one
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	well
@HeikoS	tools
@HeikoS	its all tools
 lisitsyn	true
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but its pretty hard to be multitool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what are you looking at?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: true true
@HeikoS	Bayesian is just the most principled thing in theory
@HeikoS	but then computation comes into game and everything changes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am actually interested in moving bayesian neural nets into shogun
 lisitsyn	it sounds like a good mix
@wiking	hohohoooo
@HeikoS	wiking: hi!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah good idea
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you know what a bayesian neural network is?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: a gaussian process !!!!
 lisitsyn	haha
@HeikoS	so DONE :)
@wiking	:DDDD
 lisitsyn	what about deep?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: deep GPs are nothing useful
@HeikoS	yet
 lisitsyn	there is a few things like
@wiking	eeey
@wiking	people
 lisitsyn	variational autoencoder
 lisitsyn	and stuff
@wiking	i have a matlab
@wiking	thing
@wiking	from Gunnar
 lisitsyn	I am sorry you have a matlab
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	so we could test the swig
@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	details
 lisitsyn	what's the thing?
@wiking	a server that has matlab in it officially
@wiking	so we can legally use it
 lisitsyn	ah
@wiking	it has mex and everyting
@wiking	btw fuck
@wiking	i'm tired :D
 lisitsyn	I heard you work like a mule
@wiking	no
@wiking	i'm tired of not having a good cmake
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the variational encoder is cool we should have it
@wiking	for modular interfaces
 lisitsyn	still!
 lisitsyn	ok yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@wiking	besser82: here?
@HeikoS	back in 5
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	lets' pull shogun
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: got idea where?
 lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: what's the most difficult
 lisitsyn	thats*
@wiking	which? pulling :D
 lisitsyn	no deciding where to
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	back
@HeikoS	wiking: lisitsyn we have agendas for that
@HeikoS	see latest discussion
@HeikoS	and GSoC application
@HeikoS	we know what to do
@HeikoS	just have to do it :)
 lisitsyn	honestly I don't
 lisitsyn	or I pretend to
 lisitsyn	it misses my heart hahah
@wiking	where what?
@wiking	HeikoS: what is the agenda?
@wiking	have a fake url? :D
@HeikoS	not written, but see the email that Wu wrote
@HeikoS	and the GSoC
@HeikoS	application
@HeikoS	in wiki
@wiking	aaha that email
@wiking	i remember
@wiking	i flagged it to read it
@wiking	:D
@wiking	when i have time
@wiking	haven't got around to read it yet :(
@HeikoS	we need:
@HeikoS	-documentation
@HeikoS	-installation
@HeikoS	-internal cleanups: legacy code, modularisation, testing framework, linalg
@HeikoS	very clear what is most important
@wiking	heheh the linalg should be a separate library
@HeikoS	lisitsyn 's new parameter framework
@HeikoS	lisitsyn 's ideas for modularisation
@HeikoS	solves lot of swig issues
@HeikoS	the new web manual solves documentation
 lisitsyn	oh its quite a lot
@HeikoS	the new buildbot will solve easy installation on all platforms
@wiking	new buildbot?
@HeikoS	linag makes things more efficient
@wiking	what lisitsyn 's ideas for modularisation ?
@HeikoS	wiking: we ordered one last year remember?
@wiking	HeikoS: you mean hedonism bot?
@HeikoS	wanted to run matlab and stuff on it
@HeikoS	yeah
@wiking	i'm maintaining it
@wiking	and we are using it
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	then the base class insanity etc
@wiking	for building a lot of shit on it
@HeikoS	wiking: I know, so thats good
@wiking	that's where most of the buildslaves are running
@wiking	what modularization?
@HeikoS	Just what I mean is we have very concrete things to do and know what is important
@HeikoS	wiking: shogun as modules
@wiking	ah that's a very old idea
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	rather than monolitic, your gsoc project last ear
@HeikoS	wiking: it is
@wiking	like 3 gsoc away minimum
@HeikoS	but still havent done it
@wiking	yeah :D
@wiking	time and money
@wiking	btw
@HeikoS	it would be good to make Shognu a very slim library and have modules on top
@HeikoS	pull the swig stuff out
@wiking	can i donate to shogun eV
@wiking	??
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah you can
@wiking	ok good lemme know how
@HeikoS	when I am in German ynext, I will register it, we are charitable already
@wiking	and the servers should be
@HeikoS	wiking: january
@wiking	transferred under that ev
@wiking	or?
@wiking	because now sonney2k_ takes care there about things
@wiking	i saw his amazing house :)
@HeikoS	ah cool!
@HeikoS	wiking: I have a good feeling
@HeikoS	also lambday might do an internship at Gatsby
@wiking	heheh tired of oracle?
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	I want to push this manual thing
@HeikoS	it is quite cool
@HeikoS	and sergey should push the module stuff
@HeikoS	or the parameters at least
@HeikoS	and if we pull pout the swig as a sep. project then we have achieved a lot
@HeikoS	can move to efficiency then
@HeikoS	new gsoc also coming
 lisitsyn	I can't yet decide
 lisitsyn	how to do modularization
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe the aer first
 lisitsyn	separate library?
@wiking	fugck
@wiking	i told you
@wiking	easy
@wiking	gstreamer
@wiking	they do it the best possible way i saw it
@wiking	and they achieve that thing with simple c :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	so that others can use it (including me for my research code)
@HeikoS	scientists would be so happy aobut that
@HeikoS	wiking: what about matlab and swig?
@HeikoS	https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline
@HeikoS	ok gotta leave now, but will hang out in irc a bit soon
 lisitsyn	gstreamer?
 lisitsyn	never heard you said that wiking ;)
 lisitsyn	or don't remember

@wiking	http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
@wiking	it's a fully modularized media fw
 lisitsyn	wiking: so what do they use?
 lisitsyn	C api?
@wiking	y
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	it is quite error prone you know
@wiking	heheh that thing works like a charm
@wiking	its well designed
@wiking	we can learn from it
