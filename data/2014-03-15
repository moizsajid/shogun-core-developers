 dhruv13	iglesiasg: for the KDTree implementation
-!- wavelander [~udit@122.177.168.86] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, let me see
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, lib/nanoflann/
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: okay... and I have implemented an adaptor to shogun CDistance, should that go into nanoflann.h or into lib/nanoflann/SGAdaptor.h?
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, the adaptor is for nanoflann I understand, is that right?
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: yeah
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, I think a file called nanoflann_shogun inside lib/nanoflann would make sense for that
-!- wavelander is now known as [paladin]
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: okay!
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, you can draw some inspiration from previous integrations to answer these questions, see for instance how it is done with tapkee (in lib/tapkee)

@iglesiasg	hey PirosB3
 PirosB3	hey iglesiasg
 PirosB3	hey dhruv13
@iglesiasg	PirosB3, what .light data set are you using to get the error you fired an issue for?
 PirosB3	i'm getting the name
@iglesiasg	PirosB3, I mean this one: github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1999
 dhruv13	PirosB3: hey!!
 PirosB3	toy/7class_example4_train.light
 PirosB3	just to let you know iglesiasg this issue has not appeared to me any more
 PirosB3	but still, I should not take the issue out
 PirosB3	till someone else tries it
 PirosB3	I have an open pull request https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1954
@iglesiasg	PirosB3, I am going to try and reproduce it
 PirosB3	oh great! that would be amazing
 PirosB3	iglesiasg: you have to pull down my branch
 PirosB3	all instructions are on the PR ;)
@iglesiasg	PirosB3, yeah sure, already did that
 PirosB3	please try to reproduce
 PirosB3	and update the ticket.
@iglesiasg	PirosB3, but I was using a sparse data set I believe so it didn't really work out ;)
 PirosB3	because iglesiasg I am using virtualized OS, so I just want to make sure it's not my issue
 PirosB3	I am using SparseRealFeatures

 dhruv13	iglesiasg: do i have to make changes in cmake files to use it?
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, to use what?
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: lib/nanoflann/nanoflann.hpp
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, I don't think so. Although I am not sure, just set it up and write a unit test making use of it
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: okay!

 pfm_	does shogun have CRF capabilities?

@wiking	pfm_: check out factor graphs
 pfm_	the notebook on factor graphs is not very clear on how one might include the conditional aspect in the model

 pfm_	edges are usually potentials, which become probabilities (sort of) upon normalistion
 pfm_	i haven't implemented a CRF though, so perhaps this factor graph framework is general enough to do it

 grecocd	Hi. I'm a student who is applying for the GSoC and I'm trying to find an issue I can resolve so I can put in my application. Is there anything in specific that I could work on or do I just keep triaging and pick something myself?
 lisitsyn	grecocd: hey, feel free to do anything you want
 lisitsyn	any kind of contribution is good for that
 grecocd	alright, will do! thanks lisitsyn

 shogun-buildbot_	build #222 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/222  blamelist: Daniel Pyrathon <pirosb3@gmail.com>, tklein23 <tklein23@users.noreply.github.com>
 PirosB3	yep, it's always my fault
 lisitsyn	what's up
 lisitsyn	PirosB3: I see some 'merge branch ...' commits
 lisitsyn	to avoid that do 'git pull --rebase ...'
-!- grecocd [~Cassio@100.43.25.51] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	so I mean rebase instead of merging
 PirosB3	ok fine, sorry about that
 lisitsyn	no worries
 lisitsyn	it should have been addressed in some of your PRs so we know who to blame ;)
 PirosB3	lisitsyn: do you suggest me to write my proposal this weekend, so I can post it on the ML?
 lisitsyn	PirosB3: hmm well it is up to you
 PirosB3	ahah ok
 lisitsyn	PirosB3: just be sure to make it before deadline
 PirosB3	sure
 lisitsyn	otherwise should be ok anytime :)
 PirosB3	great
@sonney2k	PirosB3, the earlier the better if you want feedback - and note you can submit your proposal already now and update it any time
 PirosB3	oh really? I didn't know that
 PirosB3	ok cool
 PirosB3	thx
 lisitsyn	ah sorry yeah this makes sense if you need any feedback

 fs_	is it intentional that without eigen3 shogun doesn't compile anymore? at least on my OS X. shogun 3.2.0 compiled fine without it. I just installed eigen3 which resolved the compilation error for a current git clone.
 fs_	can be traced back to a recent change in LogDetEstimator.cpp
 fs_	just curious
-!- grecocd [~Cassio@100.43.25.51] has quit [Quit: grecocd]
 sunil1337	fs: can you give the exact error?
 sunil1337	fs: when compiling w/o eigen3
 sunil1337	fs_: that would be the case when you have colpack installed but not eigen3
@sonney2k	fs_, not intentional!
@sonney2k	but we need the error to fix it.
 fs_	don't have the exact message anymore, but the first error was in mathematics/linalg/ratapprox/LogDestEstimator.cpp line 52: CLanczosEigenSolver* eig_solver=new CLanczosEigenSolver(op);
 fs_	unknown type name
 fs_	same for class CCGMShiftedFamilySolver
 sunil1337	fs_: okay..... will fix.
 fs_	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/d6df009ca735ccfd4cd5cbf51e2f9c6885c622c5
 fs_	that probably broke it
 sunil1337	fs_: not that the lastest one...putting a #ifdef will fix it.. but the enitre constructor won't be available...
 sunil1337	fs_: thanks for pointing out...
