-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.252.220] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: how it is going? :)
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * re74284b / (16 files in 5 dirs): Improved arpack wrapper, introduced LLTSA - http://git.io/4v9b7Q
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * r1ca6b60 / (3 files): Added references to LLTSA and NPE, updated NPE impl - http://git.io/h7eGGg
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * r0358e2e / data : Updated data - http://git.io/V2hNMg
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * rf236e25 / applications/faces/faces_embedding.py : Added faces dimreduction and clustering application - http://git.io/zZtOqA
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * re7b34f1 / src/shogun/converter/DiffusionMaps.cpp : Removed normalization from DiffusionMaps - http://git.io/lC4Q7A
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * rbf0bf48 / (2 files): Added warning of LLTSA and NPE are hardly applicable to very high-dimensional data - http://git.io/GJrTpQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, fine
 blackburn	sonney2k: I did a lot of things today :)
@sonney2k	the orange people will implemt the python buffer protocol
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	and maybe will add some wrappers such that all of shogun's machine's can be used in their framework
@sonney2k	the other way round is difficult (their code is python...)
@sonney2k	so the buffer protocol is what will help us to e.g. use their data loading etc routines
@sonney2k	blackburn, then I talked to some llvm/clang guy
 blackburn	about?
@sonney2k	and we discussed how to reduce memory requirements in compilation
@sonney2k	clang requires only 1/2 of what gcc needed btw
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	so in the end I now have a plan and will try to split up the file
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r89c91c4 / (src/shogun/io/InputParser.h src/shogun/io/SimpleFile.h): fix compiler errors occurring with clang - http://git.io/JPH_Fg
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, I also talked to the opencv guy (gary bradski)
@sonney2k	they have some new input features they call 'orb'
@sonney2k	so it makes sense to add some example based on these (or the more general concept)
 blackburn	sonney2k: orb? what is it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, then we long discussions with all the science guys
@sonney2k	about basically everything
@sonney2k	was great
@sonney2k	blackburn, sth like sift
 blackburn	I see :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you kicked chris?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	in what respect
 blackburn	in ass
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	I told him that you want to talk to him
@sonney2k	he said no time :)
@sonney2k	over
@sonney2k	well he said in november again
@sonney2k	he will fly to NY from here
@sonney2k	and so is pretty busy...
 blackburn	yeah I know
 blackburn	okay will try to finish paper by myself :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: how soon will you fly to berlin again?
@sonney2k	tomorrow
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have integrated pics: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/faceswclustering.png
 blackburn	sonney2k: you should like it :D
@sonney2k	network is slow :(
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is embedding by diffusion maps and clustering by kmeans
@sonney2k	I have the figure now
@sonney2k	the example is not perfect but mostly works
@sonney2k	I mean she is smiling in the upper left
@sonney2k	but this should be on the right side
@sonney2k	maybe you can make it more simple ?
@sonney2k	just same expression in face and then turn head to the left ..middle...right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it depends on method applied
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no time to take more photos more precisely :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: treat it as demo
@sonney2k	but certainly nice :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: two new methods available: LLTSA and NPE
 blackburn	unfortunately they involves crazy complex task
 blackburn	e.g. for pics 200x200 it requires to solve 40000x40000 *generalized* eigenproblem

 blackburn	sonney2k: still around?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would need kernels between images
 blackburn	essentially I would need to have kernels between say 20x20 and 40x30 images
 blackburn	I hope to come up with any idea of that kernel
 blackburn	but
 blackburn	we need ImageFeatures or so
 blackburn	right?
@sonney2k	no you could use gaussian kernel on bytefeatures
 blackburn	sonney2k: eh?? how to store images of different sizes in bytefeatures?
@sonney2k	why not scale them to some standard size alwyas?
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it is always possible?
@sonney2k	why not?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it leads to losing information
 blackburn	e.g. if we have 200x150 pic
 blackburn	and 20x15
 blackburn	if we resize 200->20 we will lose too much
 blackburn	but I'm pretty sure there is a way to define kernel between it
@sonney2k	then scale them all to some reasonable size - say 50x50 or so
 blackburn	sonney2k: so do you think it is the only way?
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you against image features?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean 2d features?
@sonney2k	that have arbitrary sizes?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah generally yes
@sonney2k	like stringfeatures?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	well it will just explode the wrapped code even more :)
 blackburn	ehhh how?
@sonney2k	another feature class for arbitrary types...
@sonney2k	I got to reboot
@sonney2k	brb
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm pretty sure it would have ~4 types
 blackburn	I don't think anybody wants to have float64_t 2d features
@sonney2k	blackburn, well I don't mind
 blackburn	sonney2k: yokay
 blackburn	okay*
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't want to resize images because I've got to make some classifying on roadsigns dataset
 blackburn	and pictures are pretty bad
 blackburn	resizing could make it even worse
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it true "ich bin ein berliner" is a right german?
 blackburn	:)
