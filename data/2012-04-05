 gsomix	sonney2k, there is bug in strings. i already fixed it, but not posted code.
 gsomix	sonney2k, 800MB. gcc 4.5.2
 gsomix	strange
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	how that?
 gsomix	sonney2k, are you asking about python3 or memory?
 gsomix	*or about memory
 gsomix	sonney2k, can you see my proposal?
 gsomix	at that time I can make corrections in python3 interface.

 Johannes_	Morning, do I have to install examples seperatly? Been trying all morning to run one :)
 Johannes_	Or is it perhaps as simple as that it's only included in the source code version, not from the package.
 Johannes_	yup, was as simple as that.

@sonney2k	Johannes_, use this to get them from git git submodule update --init
 Johannes_	Thank you, downloaded the source code instead, might still try that though.
 Johannes_	still can't run the java-modular examples though, probably need to install something additional because I couldn't locate modshogun.jar
@sonney2k	Johannes_, did it compile the modshogun.jar
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	if so it should be somewhere under shogun/java_modular
@sonney2k	and you need to have CLASSPATH set ...
@sonney2k	morning n4nd0
 Johannes_	not sure if it compiled the modshogun.jar, used the package, wasn't so specific at install.
-!- flxb [~cronor@g231228114.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun

@sonney2k	l8r
 Johannes_	yea tried that already, doesen't look like it installed it
 Johannes_	thanks for the help.

 sonne|work	gsomix: and even one more: in shogun we have SGArray/SGArray2 etc - these all can be removed and replaced by SGVector/SGMatrix/SGNDArray

 n4nd0	sonne|work: one doubt about the design related to covertree in KNN
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it would be really nice if CDistance would support queries for distances between vectors in the same features object
 n4nd0	sonne|work: now we can do distance(a, b) that gives the distance between vector a in lhs and vector b in rhs
 sonne|work	what is this needed for?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what I mean is that it would be useful if we can do distance_lhs(a, b)
 n4nd0	so in KNN
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	we initilize the distance with train vectors
 sonne|work	you need it for covertrees + KNN?
 n4nd0	so we have distance(train, train)
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	but if we later apply we will have distance(train, test)
 n4nd0	so if for any reason train is called again, it will fail
 sonne|work	yeah but you can do that in the train() function
 sonne|work	there you have distance(train,train)
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	and when it finishes, should it come back to the initial state
 n4nd0	e.g. if train is called after apply, then at exit it should be again distance(train, test)
 n4nd0	or is it not necessary?
 sonne|work	but apart from that I don't mind any distance_lhs() / distance_rhs or kernel_lhs/rhs functions
 sonne|work	not necessary
 sonne|work	it usually is KNN.train()
 sonne|work	then only KNN.test
 sonne|work	apply I mean
 n4nd0	well I say it because if is done something like
 n4nd0	KNN.train(train1)
 n4nd0	KNN.apply(test1)
 n4nd0	KNN.train(train2)
 n4nd0	KNN.apply()
 n4nd0	then it would make the second apply taking train2 as the vectors to classify
 n4nd0	gtg now, bye!
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes exactly that is how it is supposed to be
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok no problem then, no need to have this distance_lhs and distance_rhs I talked about
 sonne|work	of course if this behavior is not logical - we have to change things
 sonne|work	it has been so since the dawn of days so I might be too blind already to see the obvious

 Varagrawal	Hey guys
 Varagrawal	Sorry I wasn't active here for the past few days. Had my GRE this last week
 Varagrawal	I am interested in helping out for the Fast Newton Based SVM solver and the ECOC porting projects
 Varagrawal	I am quite new to statistical machine learning, but I have some basic to intermediate experience with it as well as I am quite familiar with Matlab and Octave
 Varagrawal	Is Soeren sir around?
 blackburn	hi
 blackburn	newton based svm has been recently merged
 blackburn	if you want to work on ECOC you'd have to hurry up, gsoc proposal deadline is tomorrow

 Varagrawal	I am interested in Machine Learning and want to become as good as you guys
 Varagrawal	I just got killed coz I had my midsem exams in mid-march and then my GRE the previous week :'(

 sonne|work	gsomix: seen the 2 other ideas I had?
 Varagrawal	I am going through the tutorial pages of shogun
 Varagrawal	I had cloned the repo
 Varagrawal	but then I ws getting this weird error for one application. Nando know about it and he had absolutely no clue
 gsomix	sonne|work, CSet -> hash set?
 blackburn	Varagrawal: we are on the way to fix applications, you should rather check examples
 blackburn	applications are pretty complex and domain specific
 Varagrawal	I was just running them to check how breaking some code would affect the application
 sonne|work	gsomix: yes and SGArray removal
 sonne|work	(replace by SGVector)
 sonne|work	gsomix: but now I really think this is enough...
 sonne|work	except if you intend to work 60+ hrs :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: he will be able!
 blackburn	sonne|work: 90 is ok for him
 gsomix	sonne|work, i dont have 60+ hrs. :) i think such changes can be done if there is free time.
 gsomix	blackburn, >:3
 blackburn	gsomix: you do! I recall you wanted to work for a month w/o sleeping
 sonne|work	I am sure that with the help of vodka you both will manage
 gsomix	blackburn, okay, master. =___=
 blackburn	sonne|work: the vodka
 sonne|work	yes vodking?
 sonne|work	ha :D
 blackburn	vod-king?
 blackburn	gsomix: I have some small task for you
 blackburn	all you need is to implement distributed linear svm core faster than liblinear
 blackburn	should be easy
 gsomix	sonne|work, anyway I want to work on shogun after GSoC. It's approximately infinity time. :]
 gsomix	blackburn, wut? you're at work?
 blackburn	gsomix: I am

 gsomix	professor of philosophy said that the Russian and German languages are better suited for metaphysics than others
 gsomix	fun fact
 blackburn	I guess the reason is he knows only these two ones
 gsomix	blackburn, and a little Sanskrit and English
 blackburn	really? he tends to pronounce english words in a funny way
 blackburn	however this fact could arise for real
 blackburn	I mean native language determines the way of thinking often
 gsomix	I see
 blackburn	gsomix: and even programming languages do the same

 blackburn	siddharthk: due date is tomorrow
 siddharthk	are there any free projects for which i can apply for?
 blackburn	siddharthk: what do you mean free? ;)
 siddharthk	which has less competition :P
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, maybe I can release a first iteration of the OpenCL patch tomorrow, but design will really not be optimal :D As computing kernel values one per one is completely inefficient (and the whole shogun design is kinda based on that :D)
 siddharthk	previous year me n u applied for same project :P
 siddharthk	i got axed :/
 blackburn	siddharthk: yeah
 PhilTillet	oops, should have been sonne|work rather than sonney2k maybe :D
 blackburn	siddharthk: ok libqp and multiclass probably have less competition there
 siddharthk	i can see that there are more people now :)
 blackburn	however I can't be sure
 siddharthk	ok let me check ideas page
 blackburn	not really last year there were 70+ appliants
 siddharthk	i mean on irc
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	yeah may be

 blackburn	yes however I think to have this year patches would be better ;)
 harshit_	blackburn: Can i send a pull request for shougun-toolbox/shogun-data ?
 blackburn	harshit_: yeah probably but you would need to fork it too
 blackburn	what do you need to change?
 harshit_	I tested my octave_modular example on splice dataset, So can i add splice dataset in it
 harshit_	its not too big
 harshit_	and for now I have changed my octave example on toydataset
 blackburn	that's ok
 blackburn	we use toy data in examples
 harshit_	okay ..
 PhilTillet	blackburn, you once told me about Dimension Reduction on OpenCL but I was not here :D
 blackburn	PhilTillet: yes that is something of interest probably
 PhilTillet	but, this is only simple BLAS Matrix operations right?
 PhilTillet	I mean, for PCA at least
 blackburn	yes
 PhilTillet	I think it will be very easy to port in a few months when ViennaCL will be more advanced :p they plan to include some eigenvalues algorithms on GPU
 PhilTillet	then it would be possible without writing any OpenCL code :p
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.94.221] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 blackburn	I don't think they will include efficient sparse eigensolver
 PhilTillet	hmmm
 PhilTillet	this was a GSoC project last year as far as I remember
 blackburn	LLE/LTSA/HLLE/.... are sparse
 blackburn	really? I'll take a look later
 PhilTillet	hmmm yes indeed
 PhilTillet	maybe it was not sparse
 PhilTillet	It was mainly Lanczos and Arnoldi's
 blackburn	lanczos and arnoldi stuff makes use of matrix-vector product
 blackburn	so they could be sparse
 PhilTillet	yep
 PhilTillet	there is sparse matrix-vector implemented
 blackburn	however in shogun I had to integrate superlu
 blackburn	there was need of sparse solver
 PhilTillet	well
 PhilTillet	there is GPU LU decomposition on ViennaCL too I think
 PhilTillet	:p
 blackburn	superlu is sparse (again this word) ;)
 PhilTillet	haha
 PhilTillet	sparsity yay
 PhilTillet	actually i'm not an expert concerning ViennaCL, but if you have some question concerning what linalg operation is implemented, I can relay them to the project leader
 blackburn	ok thanks
 blackburn	okay gtg

 PhilTillet_	the swig interface ? :p
 PhilTillet_	isn't autotools used?
 wiking	well if you want to support modules
 wiking	like python_modular
 wiking	and such then you'll want swig
 wiking	and for that you have to do some extra work...
 PhilTillet_	yes I know a bit of swig, headache
@sonney2k	no autotools all magic
 PhilTillet_	sounds like fun
 PhilTillet_	XD
 PhilTillet_	oh, and some other question, I used #ifdef USE_OPENCL about everywhere, but then once you have the library you have to do #define USE_OPENCL so that you see the functions, any way to avoid this? :p
@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, that can be taken care of later via some configure option
 PhilTillet_	oh yes, true

 PhilTillet_	sonney2k, I know, but I cannot implement that in 1 week :D Making it work for big dataset is the whole point of the SoC
 PhilTillet_	:p
@sonney2k	that is why you need to call kernel(i,j) most of the time. actually even examples must not be in memory
@sonney2k	and are computed on-the-fly
 PhilTillet_	n4nd0, KDevelop
@sonney2k	ok
 PhilTillet_	I mean it will require some clever design, but I am sure it is possible to do some queueing system, with flushing
 PhilTillet_	and, even if it is not, dot product is still faster on GPU than on CPU
 PhilTillet_	usually
 PhilTillet_	it should suffer from bad caching though :p

@sonney2k	well you certainly can do speedups for special cases - like when simplefeatures are used and the feature matrix is in memory
 PhilTillet_	yes
 PhilTillet_	and when simplefeatures matrix do not fit in memory, it should be possible to transfer it chunks by chunk, for apply at least
 PhilTillet_	even though the training might get more complicated
 PhilTillet_	and, even for training, something clever might be to use hybrid cpu/gpu algorithm
 PhilTillet_	but synchronization might then be a pain
@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, well lets focus on testing first
@sonney2k	training usually has to be done once
@sonney2k	testing inf times
 PhilTillet_	true :d
 PhilTillet_	I mean, for testing, examples are independent, so it might be possible to do something like : "Transfer chunk 1 from CPU to GPU, compute chunk 2 on CPU, get chunk 1 result, transfer chunk 3 to GPU, compute chunk 4 on CPU
 PhilTillet_	things like that
 PhilTillet_	i'll spend some time again on my gsoc timeline, to focus on hybrid CPU / GPU algorithm
 harshit_	sonney2k: Is fast k-Means algo implemented in shogun ? I saw this in issues section of github .
 harshit_	link:https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/338
@sonney2k	harshit_, no unfortunately not
 harshit_	sonney2k: Its mentioned by authors that you cannot redistribute this code . but still can we port it ?
 n4nd0	I am working in cover tree integration now
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for KNN right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	harshit_, well the algoritm / paper is very simple
@sonney2k	probably devil is in the detail but still one can compare outputs of what they get to what you would implement
 harshit_	n4nd0 : is cover tree , in anyway  thats related to fast k-means .. i think it wound not but still confirming ..
 harshit_	coz I am always confused about differences in KNN and K means except one is unsupervised
 harshit_	sonney2k: yeah algo is really simple..got one more thing to work on :)
@sonney2k	yeah covertree would speed up k-means too - in the end you need distances for that too
 n4nd0	it is turning out to be a bit cumbersome though :S

 flxb	Is there a possibility to save a GMNPSVM without using pickle? pickle is too slow, because the classifier is 15GB and cPickle has a memory bug.
@sonney2k	flxb, look at serialization_complex_example.py

 n4nd0	blackburn: hey! I got a question here
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am analizing with valgrind a python example
 gsomix	blackburn, hello, master
 blackburn	gsomix: lol
 gsomix	>:3
 blackburn	n4nd0: sooo
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://snipt.org/uhaji0
 blackburn	aham
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am giving you the code where it happens, w8
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/classifier/KNN.cpp
 n4nd0	line 235 there
 n4nd0	it appears 296 in valgrind because I have executed it in my local version with CoverTree stuff, but this is not related
 n4nd0	no CoverTree used there yet
 blackburn	ok  pretty strange
 blackburn	I'd say it is a false alarm there
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please change the line SGMatrix<int32_t>(output,num_lab,m_k)
@sonney2k	to SGMatrix<int32_t>(output,num_lab,m_k,true)
@sonney2k	then it should be fixed
 blackburn	yeah had the same idea
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn: you guys are pretty good :)
 n4nd0	fixed
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you have a good explanation for it?
@sonney2k	yeah - do valgrind only w/ debugging flags on + no optimizations
@sonney2k	otherwise line nr might not fit
 blackburn	what is the reproducing example?
 n4nd0	classifier_knn_python_modular.py
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I didn't understand ... I mean the line valgrind was right I think
 blackburn	n4nd0: true stands for do_free
@sonney2k	then I don't understand your question :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: because the part of memory not freed is in output = SG_MALLOC(...)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah the question is, why do we need to set explicitily this do_free?
 PhilTillet_	sonney2k, the patch works and should be issued soon :p
 PhilTillet_	it is in a new branch, but do you want it as a single commit?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, this do_free needs to be set whenever you alloc sth that is returned / if you just pass a ptr then it should be false
@sonney2k	but this is what I would like to change with the refcounting stuff
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I understand
 gsomix	sonney2k, there is small pull request. It's related to python3 interface. I hope I will send fixes for examples tomorrow.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok
@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, not sure what you mean - something we can review where each commit compiles would be nice
 PhilTillet_	ok, my question was dumb indeed
 PhilTillet_	i'll discard the bugfix commits :D
@sonney2k	(additional / unrelated bugfix commits as extra pull requests please)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please send a pull request with that one-liner KNN patch
 PhilTillet_	sonney2k, what do you mean?
@sonney2k	bugfixes you did on the side
 PhilTillet_	like bugfixes on my generator?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you want me to prepare an example of performance improvement first?
 PhilTillet_	oops
 PhilTillet_	not generator
 PhilTillet_	bugfix on my opencl support?
 PhilTillet_	i did no additional shogun bugfix in this opencl branch if this is the question
 PhilTillet_	:p
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it would be interesting to know how much the covertree helps or?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I was planning to do that and later issue the pull request
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but I can open it before the example if you want so we can start fixing things I may have done wrong
@sonney2k	n4nd0, why not
 gsomix	sonney2k, I have some problems with my "const char*" typemap. http://pastebin.com/tiq44rbE
 gsomix	who should take care of freeing memory here?
 gsomix	there is part in python3 doc: http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/bytes.html?highlight=pybytes_asstring#PyBytes_AsString
@sonney2k	gsomix, i don't think const char* typemaps can work
@sonney2k	but I am not an expert in this either
@sonney2k	but IMHO char* is automagically swig wrapped
@sonney2k	so anything doing char* foo()
@sonney2k	or void foo(char* x) should work
 gsomix	sonney2k, i had problems in modelselection example.
 gsomix	for example, line: param_power_kernel_degree=ModelSelectionParameters("degree")
 gsomix	SWIG incorrectly converted "degree" into const char*
 gsomix	in python3
 gsomix	then I wrote simple typemap.
 gsomix	at now it works. but I don't know how well.
@sonney2k	I think we have to remove the const* stuff somewhere then
 n4nd0	well guys, good night
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will issue a PR with covertree stuff tomorrow morning probably
 gsomix	n4nd0, good night
@sonney2k	n4nd0, nite nite
