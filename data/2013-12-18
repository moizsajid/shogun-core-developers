 besser82	sonne|work:  and are known to be _the_ addon-ressource for FC and RHEL / CentOS / SL

 besser82	bb_: Hey ya!  Did all work?
 wiking	bb_: ping! you were looking for me for a while
 bb_	besser82 i took a long time to install fedora it crashed in between and was not able to fix screen resolution
 bb_	it did now
 wiking	bb_: r u now under osx or shogun?
 bb_	wiking yes i am at the
 wiking	i mean fedora
 bb_	wiking osx and have fedora on my virtual box
 bb_	wiking would like to get shogun built on osx so that i dont have to use something which i am not comfortable with
 wiking	bb_: i've written u last time to check for a line in CMakeFiles/Makefile.cmake
 wiking	bb_: that is build/CMakeFiles/Makefile.cmake
 wiking	do u have a line:   "../cmake/spinlock-test-darwin.cpp"
 wiking	?
 bb_	wiking yes i checked that and it has that line
 wiking	mmm oookeeey
 wiking	then it gets very interesting
 wiking	bb_: can u plz pastebin src/shogun/lib/config.h after u ran cmake...
 bb_	wiking okay doing that now
 wiking	ok
 bb_	wiking here it is http://pastebin.com/nyt2CmAW
 wiking	bb_: ok an now if u try to build u get the spinlock error?
 bb_	wiking yes ... but i am recompiling now
 wiking	bb_: okey so now we have a problem because all the macros in the config.h actually points to use spinlock. do you have maybe another version of shogun installed somewhere on your machine?
 wiking	i mean use osx' native spinlock instead of pthread spinlock
 bb_	i was trying to install shogun 3
 bb_	wiking but it did not make any progress
 wiking	bb_: ok so there's no shogun stuff  under /usr/local/include/shogun* right?
 wiking	or maybe /opt/local/include/shogun*
 bb_	okay let me check
 wiking	or maybe /usr/include/shogun
 wiking	just in case plz check
 wiking	if there's nothing and with the current setup you still get that pthread_spinlock_t problem
 bb_	wiking
 wiking	then in the root of shogun source do this: clang -I./src/ -E src/shogun/lib/Lock.cpp|tail
 wiking	and copy-paste
 wiking	bb_: yeas?
 bb_	wiking /opt/local/include/shogun is present
 wiking	bb_: hah
 wiking	bb_: did u maybe installed it with
 wiking	macports?
 wiking	bb_: just out of curiousity could u please pastebin /opt/local/include/shogun/lib/config.h ?
 bb_	wiking yes a couple of years ago i tried when i got this laptop
 wiking	bb_: pastebin plz
 wiking	bb_: and then the only thing you need to do is: 'sudo port deactivate shogun'
 wiking	and then re-run cmake + make
 bb_	wiking here is the config.h from opt/local http://pastebin.com/bHKttd5y
 wiking	ok
 wiking	mmmm ok do those things i've suggested
 wiking	(deactivate the port and rerun cmake+make
 bb_	wiking ok iam dojgn that now
 bb_	wiking looks like it is working it is at 32% already
 bb_	wiking thanks a lot
 wiking	bb_: nw
 bb_	wiking it gives me this error now http://pastebin.com/P726967a

 wiking	heh that's a fucking error ...
 wiking	bb_: do u use protobuf?
 bb_	wiking no
 bb_	how do i remove it
 wiking	bb_: sudo port uninstall protobuf-cpp
 bb_	wiking i dont think it was installed through macports
 wiking	bb_: port installed|grep protobuf
 wiking	bb_: what's the output of that
 bb_	wiking it does not return anything
 wiking	lol
 wiking	man it's impossible with this fucking protobuf
 bb_	wiking i see these libraries in /usr/local/lib
 bb_	wiking can i just manually delete them
 wiking	bb_: no it's really about shogun and how fuckedup the protobuf handling is currently
 wiking	bb_: one option is to basically comment out one line in CMakeLists.txt
 bb_	wiking okay so if i remove it and shogun does not detect protobuf then how does it matter...
 wiking	line 793 should be FIND_PACKAGE(Protobuf)
 wiking	right?
 bb_	let me check
 wiking	just put a # in the beginning of that line
 wiking	so it should be
 wiking	#FIND_PACKAGE(Protobuf)
 wiking	once you've done that completely remove the build directory's content: rm -rf build/*
 wiking	and then rerun cmake in build
 wiking	and make
 bb_	wiking i am doing that now
 wiking	bb_: that should solve the problem with protobuf
 bb_	wiking i commented out the line but it still searches for it and finds it and give the same error
 wiking	bb_: i told u... u should remove the whole build directory and recreate + cmake it
 wiking	otherwise it'll find it in the cache
 bb_	wiking i did that multiple times.. it was still finding it i removed the protobuf library itself from /usr/local/lib
 wiking	?
 wiking	what u r saying is that u dont have protobuf under /usr/local/lib
 wiking	and u commented out findpackage... and it still finds it?
 wiking	quite hard to see that happening
 bb_	wiking it does not after i deleted it from /usr/local/lib but now i get this error http://pastebin.com/z6g5dCgA
 bb_	wiking python.swg error
 wiking	?!
 wiking	wtf is that
 bb_	wiking are you looking at the pastebin
 wiking	/opt/local/share/swig/2.0.11/python/std_vector.i
 wiking	/opt/local/share/swig/2.0.11/std/std_vector.i
 wiking	u should have something similar
 wiking	of course change the version of the swig..
 bb_	wiking i do 2.0.9 what do you want me to do
 wiking	do have the std_vector.i at those locations or not?
 wiking	if not you have a problem
 wiking	if yes then i sincerely have no clue what's the problem
 wiking	it works for me
 bb_	wiking i have this /opt/local/share/swig/2.0.11/std/std_vector.i but i dont have /opt/local/share/swig/2.0.11/python/std_vector.i infact i dont even have directory python
 wiking	bb_: maybe because you dont have swig-python port installed?
 wiking	w/o that it's quite hard to create python swig interface...
 bb_	may be
 wiking	sudo port install swig-python
 bb_	wiking but why are we using macports version is there not a native package that installs
 bb_	wiking when i do sudo port install swig-python it fails
 bb_	wiking i update the ports and was able to install the swig-python it finished compiling
 bb_	wiking make install went fine too about to test few examples
 bb_	wiking thanks..
 wiking	bb_: ?!?!
 wiking	bb_: we do not ship swig packages
 wiking	bb_: if u wanna use swig generated modular interfaces u need to have swig installed
 wiking	bb_: welcome
 bb_	wiking when i run an example it gives me no module named modshogun
 wiking	bb_: where and how do u run the example?
 bb_	wiking in undocumented/python_modular/graphical/
 bb_	wiking i do python svm.py
 bb_	wiking do i have to make some symbolic link or something
 wiking	bb_: no ... did u do make install?
 bb_	wiking yes
 wiking	bb_: and u have something like /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/shogun ?
 bb_	wiking yes
 wiking	if u do then the only problem is that the modshogun module is not in your python path
 wiking	so basically
 wiking	export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
 wiking	and then try to run the example the way u tried
 bb_	wiking yes it worked .. how do i make documented examples out of the undocumented ones
 wiking	bb_: why would u like to have that?
 wiking	i mean that some leftover thing ... that has nothing to do with examples being able to work or not
 bb_	wiking okay because so mcuh has changed from last when i used shogun
 bb_	that i thought it was the best place to start
 wiking	bb_: best place to start is to try the ipython notebooks
 wiking	doc/ipython-notebooks/
 wiking	but u can play with them online as well
 wiking	http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org
 bb_	wiking that is totally new to me..
 wiking	bb_: have fun
 bb_	wiking thanks
 bb_	i will bug you if i run into any issues
 bb_	wiking do you use any specific editor for python on mac
 wiking	specific for python no...
 wiking	i use sublimetext
 wiking	but any is good
 wiking	for python i would suggest the ipython notebook framework as it does the whole autocompletion etc.
 wiking	sudo port install py27-ipython +notebook +parallel +scientific
 wiking	or if u use other version of python in macports use the right py* prefix
 bb_	wiking okay i will give it a try
