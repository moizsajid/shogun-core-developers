 CIA-10	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra79affd / applications/edrt/tutorial.pdf : Removed tutorial pdf - http://git.io/H1LcFQ
 blackburn	sonne|work: around?
@sonney2k	blackburn, still here
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok I had a question
 blackburn	is 5 pages OK for JMLR mloss?
@sonney2k	4 pages + 1 citations only
 blackburn	so my paper would be ok..
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: how hard to integrate my things to matlab interface?
 blackburn	can't find a way to start implementing it :D
@sonney2k	that would be all static interfaces
@sonney2k	well preprocessors trivial
@sonney2k	converters need some work
 blackburn	sonney2k: can it be integrated as preprocessors?
@sonney2k	doesn't make sense right? would be converting A to B
 blackburn	well why?
 blackburn	these methods were preprocessors before
@sonney2k	processors where same type conversion attached to features
@sonney2k	converters return new stuff
 blackburn	okay then I think using it as simplefeatures->simplefeatures would be enough for matlab
@sonney2k	anyfeatures -> simplefeatures or?
@sonney2k	it is not that difficult
 blackburn	I have no idea of implementing it
 blackburn	will take time :(
 blackburn	gunnar asked 'what about matlab' and I think yes, it is needed
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw there are submissions of shogun paper in git, reviewers are damn hard guys
 blackburn	more than I though
 blackburn	t
@sonney2k	blackburn, takes you <1 day I would say
 blackburn	okay will try to get into it later
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope we will manage to release soon - I'll submit paper once shogun is released

@sonney2k	blackburn, I would suggest you start with GUIPreProc*
 blackburn	yeah I got it
 blackburn	almost done already I hope
 blackburn	sonney2k: does USAGE_I supports optional args?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to describe sg('create_converter','lle',10)?
@sonney2k	check the src I would have to look it up too
 blackburn	yeah I have difficulties with srcs
 blackburn	USAGE_I(N_CREATE_EMBEDDING,USAGE_STR,??)
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it really possible to have number params here?
 blackburn	or only strings?
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sg('method',132321312)
 blackburn	possible?
 blackburn	or only sg('method','123213')?
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	even matrices, etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to describe it :(
@sonney2k	not in the usage string
@sonney2k	that is jsut some help string
@sonney2k	just
 blackburn	okay will check other examples

 blackburn	sonney2k: wow got first prototype :D

 blackburn	good framework
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wrote it :)
 blackburn	well I do not like some things in shogun ya know
 blackburn	;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think following semantics is ok?
 blackburn	sg('create_converter','lle',10);
 blackburn	embedding = sg('embed','TRAIN')
 blackburn	Geoff Hinton once built a neural network that beat Chuck Norris on MNIST.
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw did you try some vim+eclipse integration? I've seen something about it
