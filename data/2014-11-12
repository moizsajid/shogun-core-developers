 wiking_	oooh yeah
 wiking_	.net on linux by m$
@lisitsyn	 wiking_ have you been following the touchdown?
@lisitsyn	its like amazing
 wiking_	lisitsyn: hehhehe
 wiking_	barely
 wiking_	had too many meetings
@lisitsyn	wiking_: how was your interview?
 wiking_	mmm which? ah that one
 wiking_	crazy bad :D
-!- wiking_ is now known as wiking
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	why?
 wiking	hehehe dontaske
 wiking	it was really bad
 wiking	so what's with 67p
 wiking	?
 wiking	touchdown?
 wiking	p67 that is
 wiking	lisitsyn: "Wow! Now live-debugging the .NET app running inside a @docker container on @azure (#linux) from its @VisualStudio env on @windows #vsconnect"
 wiking	:>>>
@lisitsyn	wiking: heh
 wiking	so fuck this shit :)
 wiking	btw this is how one can haz shogun
 wiking	docker
 wiking	(windows)
@lisitsyn	wiking: I barely understand how that can be possible
 wiking	easy
 wiking	docker works on windows
 wiking	u fire up a linux based docker container
 wiking	and apt-get install shogun
 wiking	:D
@lisitsyn	I always thought docker uses linux kernel
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	wiking: how the heck it works then
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	On March 13, 2014, with the release of version 0.9, Docker dropped LXC as the default execution environment and replaced it with its own libcontainer library
@lisitsyn	is that it?
 wiking	no
 wiking	i mean in a way yes
@lisitsyn	wiking: so the thing is that they mask all OS calls
@lisitsyn	I guess they'd need to write some kind of adapter for linux calls for windows, right?
 wiking	ye
 wiking	well
 wiking	depends of course
 wiking	what's your base os in the container
 wiking	but yeah on the end
 wiking	there's a windows sys call <-> linux sys call mapping
