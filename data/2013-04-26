 foulwall	Hi sonney2k
 foulwall	I saw the idea "mloss.org and mldata.org integration" is also available. I think I can do some work on that after I finish the demos.
 sonne|work	foulwall: I think demos is more work than you expect :)
 sonne|work	But sure we could also allow uploads of *small* data sets for the demo
-!- lisitsyn [~blackburn@46.20.65.122] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 foulwall	sonne|work: Maybe after the GSoC I'll help that.
 foulwall	sonne|work: yeah, some demos will need bigger data set
 sonne|work	foulwall: cheng and me would be happy if you do...
 foulwall	sonne|work: I love shogun, so just at you service, meanwhile I can get myself trained in developing them.

@HeikoS	Yanglittle, hi, yes we can do this
@HeikoS	check scores_to_probabilities of BinaryLabels
@HeikoS	there is also an example in libshogun
@wiking	HeikoS: what bug?
@wiking	#948
@wiking	?
@iglesiasg	wiking, HeikoS : hey guys, one thing that I don't quite understand regarding the randomness issue with the tests
@iglesiasg	wiking: it fails across platforms/archs because we are relying too much on the seed right?
@wiking	not about seed
@wiking	it's about RNG
@iglesiasg	wiking: then?
@wiking	it's not the same accross platforms
@iglesiasg	wiking: ok but say
@wiking	hence seeded RNG won't be the same either
@iglesiasg	if it is because we are relying on the seed I understand
@iglesiasg	otherwise, I don't
@iglesiasg	because if we are generating numbers from say an interval [0,1]
@HeikoS	wiking: ?
@iglesiasg	why does it make a difference how are they generated as long as they are in that interval?
@wiking	iglesiasg: because they are not the same exact number? :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: we save results to files, then compare against them
@HeikoS	to any random stuff will kill us
@iglesiasg	wiking: then, we are relying too much on the seed
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: some methods are random
@wiking	iglesiasg: with seed(x) in the code u suppose that the random will be always the same
@iglesiasg	wiking: i.e. we are generating "random numbers" that are not random actually
@HeikoS	no way around that
@iglesiasg	wiking: ok, I understand
@HeikoS	data doesnt have to be, but other things have to be
@wiking	which is true until u r using the same system
@HeikoS	wiking: what was with the bug?
@wiking	HeikoS: nada realised
@iglesiasg	wiking: then it doesn't make sense to me to face problems for that
@HeikoS	what if we have our own random machine in shogun?
@HeikoS	would that solve it?
@iglesiasg	it is just that the tests don't work on random data
@HeikoS	what about python?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: its not only that data
@wiking	HeikoS: python uses system rng afaik
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: yeah, it is also internally like in CV you said
@iglesiasg	right?
@HeikoS	wiking: so even python is not reproducible?
@wiking	HeikoS: and anyhow now we are failing exactly with python_modular ;P
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: exactly
@HeikoS	wiking: so we need a random machine in shogun that can produce everything
@HeikoS	as far as i know we mainly use normal and uniform samples from python
@HeikoS	we have both in shogun
@HeikoS	just need to use them instead of the numpy methods then
@HeikoS	or we change our approach
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking: sonne|work: iglesiasg: please check mail
@HeikoS	that is, only use fixed data
@HeikoS	dont test random methods but whether results make sense
@HeikoS	I did that a while ago but its also problematic
@HeikoS	like x-val results
@HeikoS	you can define an interval of what you expect
@HeikoS	but no guarantee
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: it is looking good :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: dito
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it bad or good?
@lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: rather than using our random machine
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: I would enable the possibility of setting randomly generated values as the deafult option, but in tests we set that from outsite
@iglesiasg	outside*
@iglesiasg	that would be for the parts that use random numbers internally, e.g. CV
@lisitsyn	wiking: I like your font
 sonne|work	HeikoS, wiking, iglesiasg - we need a portable random number generator
@wiking	lisitsyn: which? :))))
@wiking	lisitsyn: i think i've fixed it
 sonne|work	eigen3?
@lisitsyn	wiking: in the issue you just created
@lisitsyn	wiking: I just read a mail and whoa!
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: I think the solution can be a bigger problem than the original one :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: hahahah yeah
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: eigen3 doesn't have great random
@wiking	lisitsyn: github took it's work seriously with highlighting :))
@wiking	sonne|work: afaik openssl/ssh will have one ;)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: C++11 has portable random stuff
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	sonne|work: and those ones are for sure portable
@wiking	sonne|work: it's now matter of teste
@wiking	*taste
@wiking	to depend shogun on openssl
@wiking	or just cut out the rng from openssl
@lisitsyn	are we going to use C++11 btw?
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	i'd rather go with simple dependency, as nowadays a system w/o openssl is pretty weird... unless it's not connected to the network :P
@HeikoS	true ssl is easy to depend on
@HeikoS	how about c++11?
@HeikoS	what would that do to us?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am not sure it is really portable but I just ask if we are going to use new standard
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: different question, lets solve the other one first :)
@HeikoS	if it *is* portable, we could do it
@HeikoS	but what would it do to us?
@HeikoS	whats needed to use it?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: --std=c++0x IIRC
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: starting from gcc 4.6 or 4.7
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: have you tried what happens then?

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: happens like?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: once you use newer standard you can use new headers
@lisitsyn	like shared_ptr or these rng things
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah and std collections use move semantics
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I mean, does it compile?
@wiking	HeikoS: it does
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes of course, back compatibility is a must
@HeikoS	then why not use it?
@wiking	at least with clang yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it can get into troubles though
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: as I know shared libraries are not compatible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@wiking	lisitsyn: do you know an easy way to generate a skeleton of a polygon?
@lisitsyn	wiking: generate?
@lisitsyn	wiking: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/StraightSkeletonDefinition.png like that?
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah similar but my polygon is a simple 2D one
@lisitsyn	I don't know the algorithm
@wiking	yeah i'm trying to find one as well atm...
