@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh shogun is no longer in debian unstable
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	due to mono no longer being available on s390
 blackburn	haha
@sonney2k	I don't really know how to properly package it
@sonney2k	I used to create all packages in one go
@sonney2k	but look at the dependency list: python, lua, ruby, java, octave, mono, swig, ...
@sonney2k	one of them will fail for sure
@sonney2k	so getting it into stable is close to impossible
 blackburn	no idea - may be we don't need it at all?
@sonney2k	I think binary packages help users a lot
 blackburn	not sure about that - we always recommend to build latest
@sonney2k	these certainly are just playing with it
@sonney2k	would you? I thought currently some tests are commented because they are not working
@sonney2k	since you changed strings?
 blackburn	no, strings are mostly ok
@sonney2k	serialization too?
 blackburn	yeah there is a bug with its deletion though
@sonney2k	so? can you fix it?
@sonney2k	this remind me that we need to convert sparse features to use SGSparseMatrix underneath
@sonney2k	bah
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will attempt a little bit later
