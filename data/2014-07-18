@HeikoS	saw your mail
@lisitsyn	this one
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: already answered
@lisitsyn	oh okay
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: solution: transform all subkernels to custom ones
@HeikoS	and make it a combined
@lisitsyn	ha!
@HeikoS	but should be disabled as default
@HeikoS	since memory intense
@lisitsyn	hmm ok
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: could you please post it as issue if you get some time?
@lisitsyn	I'll try to take care of that tomorro
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can do, but will not happen in the next couple of days. too busy now and gsoc thing needs some attention
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok I'll put a note for myself now
@HeikoS	feel free to fix, just overload the train_locked method properly, either disabling autolock, or replacing the subkernels by custom ones
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok sounds good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good night!
