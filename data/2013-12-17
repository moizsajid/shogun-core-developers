 sonne|work	besser82: could you try build (even on arm!) with csharp and the current 3.1 git snapshot that has the fix?
 sonne|work	s/try build/try a build/
 besser82	sonne|work: sure can do...
 besser82	sonne|work: just a coffe  && cig, please  ;)
 sonne|work	kthx :D
 besser82	sonne|work: I actually _just_ got up  :-P
 sonne|work	yeah 4 hours time shift
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.181.207] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 besser82	sonne|work: yes, those damn 4h timeshift from B  --> H  :-P
 lisitsyn	4hours? between?
 lisitsyn	besser82: where are you? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: in Germany  :-P  near Hannover
 besser82	lisitsyn: but sonne and I were just joking...
 lisitsyn	besser82: what's the timeshift then?
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: Because I just got up ~10:00h  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: sometimes I get up like 12:30
 lisitsyn	2.5hrs after I should have been at job already :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: my "usual" time is ~ 6:15h
 lisitsyn	working hours don't work for me :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: but today i just went to bed about thattime  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's crazy I'll never be able to wake up that early
 besser82	lisitsyn: become a few years older and get children  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: that solves your problem  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah and I will never have spare time anymore :D
 lisitsyn	solves most of the problems
 besser82	lisitsyn: just for the first ~4 years...
 besser82	lisitsyn: at the age of 4 - 5 they get pretty on their own  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey you've got family quite early ain't you?
 lisitsyn	I had an impression that the most of germans are like sonne|work ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes, first kid @ 22  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: there is no chance for me to be the first in that race for me :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: not all, germans are like sonne  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: he is "Berliner" and I'm "Niedersachse"  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: there's a pretty difference in those  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah I heard you have totally different language
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes,  dialects are pretty various in diferrent locations of germany  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: would you believe russian is the same all around the globe?
 besser82	lisitsyn: not really  ;)
 lisitsyn	it is :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: damn :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: the only thing is not active speakers
 lisitsyn	like american russians
 lisitsyn	they have got some american accent
 lisitsyn	but for speakers it is the same
 lisitsyn	no different spelling or whatever
 besser82	lisitsyn: but german isn't.  in Berlin they speak other dialect compared to K?ln or Stuttgart or Hannover ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I can't compare but what I heard in berlin was different from what I heard in some german audio stuff
 besser82	lisitsyn: in Germany there may be even other words used, e.g. "fried chicken" ---> Berlin and sourrounding is "Broiler"  Hannover is "Brath?hnchen"  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: If yoou would come to HAnnover, you would hear like is was in radio  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yours sounds more complex thus more german
 besser82	lisitsyn: *rofl*
 sonne|work	or  'Berliner' vs.  'Pfannkuchen'
 lisitsyn	besser82: hochdeutsch, right?
 besser82	lisitsyn: right! Here's Hochdeutsch  ;)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: don't you have deadlines? besser82 is *very* busy testing the new shogun snapshot ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: that are two completely different things  ;)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: one is passed
 lisitsyn	I successfully failed or had failured success I don't know
 lisitsyn	it works but bad :D
 besser82	sonne|work: there you go:  http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=6304335
 sonne|work	besser82: what does http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=6304335 mean? is it finished now?
 besser82	sonne|work: no, it is the url to the build...
 besser82	sonne|work: but it show you est. complete time ---> Est. CompletionTue, 17 Dec 2013 11:31:54 UTC

 adrin	besser82, hi, I had some spare time and tried to fix .doxy2swig.py, it seems (at least) compiling.
 adrin	http://pastebin.com/kdqz3JFv
 adrin	no the problem is this:
 adrin	http://pastebin.com/aDqJJxr4
 besser82	adrin: Hi!  leeme have a look  ;)
 besser82	adrin: just a moment...
 adrin	explanation: I know shogun is installed somewhere else, but I don't have access to remove it, and I don't want to. I just need to compile a fresh one and install in a custom location.
 sonne|work	adrin: yeah unfortunately a known bug with our current cmake setup - besser82 is going to fix this  for x-mas :D
 adrin	sonne|work: oh, ok, I guess I can't help there. Not really familiar with cmake :(
 besser82	adrin: yes, as sonne|work said  ;)
 besser82	adrin: the problem is caused by headers conflicting from /usr/{local}/include with the ones in shogun-src
 besser82	adrin: and there is no real simple way to circumvent that  :(
 besser82	adrin: but I'm working on it  ;)
 adrin	besser82: I see. Thanks :)
 besser82	adrin: np.  :)  You're welcome  ;)
 adrin	besser82: let me know if the patch is fine. It should work with python 2/3
 besser82	adrin: will check that during tomorrow  :)  I'm currently quite busy on those stuff ;)
 besser82	adrin: with those stuff I mean: CMake && shogun  ;)

 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah I can hardly read your replaces but I managed to understand ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: thats just minor sed exp  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: on #fedora-* we all talk like that ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: and how's your fork-loader loading recognition algo going?
 lisitsyn	besser82: it works a bit
 lisitsyn	with bag of words features
 besser82	lisitsyn: :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: SHOGUN:getForkLoaderIsLoaded()  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: I got a bit more time to train this shit
 lisitsyn	I am not very optimistic about it due to my stupidity but who knows :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I guess you will be able to hack it  ;)  I believe in you!  You can dooooooooooooooo it!
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is some kind of thing that wasn't done in two months and required to be done asap :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: holy shit, dude  :S
 besser82	lisitsyn: Who didn't do it?  You or you're customer?
 lisitsyn	besser82: didn't do what?
 besser82	lisitsyn: train proper model / fork-loader-stuff
 lisitsyn	that's my fault
 lisitsyn	I have no penalty just $$ loss but I feel some kind of responsibility
 lisitsyn	that's why I care
 besser82	lisitsyn: I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: You have moral values.  I like that ;)
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	besser82: no that's just vodka values
 besser82	lisitsyn: Ahhh...  the responsibility about your bank account...  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: no not really, I wish I quit this 'task'
 lisitsyn	but it seems it would fail their plans a bit
 besser82	lisitsyn: lemme see if I can get someone who can help you...
 lisitsyn	ha! I'd appreciate any advice
 bb_	besser82 so where do i get fedora 20
 bb_	besser82 and shogun would install on it with no problems
 besser82	bb_: Here you go:  http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora
 besser82	bb_: You should be able to install recent shogun from packages
 besser82	bb_: like `yum install shogun`
 besser82	bb_: if you need some bindings, e.g. Python you can find them using `yum list *shogun*`
 bb_	besser82 okay i am getting fedora now
 bb_	besser82 will let you know how it goes i want python modular installation
 besser82	bb_: then install F20 and you can install python_modular with `yum install python-shogun`
 bb_	besser82 i have not received any help on installation on osx should i use the mailing list
 besser82	bb_: that would be an option, since the mailing list has a somewhat broader audiance...
 bb_	besser82 okay will this install all the bindings with hdf5 and all the other
 bb_	packages that shogun looks for
 besser82	bb_: that will install python_modular and maxed out libshogun
 besser82	bb_: but no SVM^light
 besser82	bb_: since we cannot ship that in fedora, because of it's shitty license
 besser82	bb_: but everything else is fully available within shogun
 besser82	bb_: as shipped for fedora
 lisitsyn	besser82: what's with svm bright? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I cannot work on everything @ the same time  ;)
 bb_	besser82 okay but my code uses svm-light
 bb_	has that been disabled
 besser82	bb_: in the stock-repo version yes
 besser82	bb_: but I can give you suitable && working rpms  from my personal collection  ;)
 bb_	besser82 okay that would be nice
 besser82	lisitsyn: we are currently analyzing the maths magic and try to squeeze out any possible optimization  ;)
 besser82	bb_: np ;) You're welcome  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I see :)
 bb_	besser82 i would ping you once i install fedora
 besser82	bb_: allright ;)
 besser82	bb_: then I just need your email-addy to give you dl-links  ;)
 bb_	besser82
 bb_	okay thanks so it would be the same as installing from the source
 besser82	lisitsyn: I have real interest in svm^bright myself, since I need that for my business, too  ;)
 besser82	bb_: nearly  ;)
 besser82	bb_: it would be like `yum local-install  $rpms`  ;)
 bb_	besser82 okay i am waiting for it to download..
 besser82	bb_: i will provide you with a tarball with all builds && srpm
 bb_	besser82 okay thanks do you already have it handy i can download that too...
 besser82	bb_: currently building....
 besser82	bb_: and then uploading  ;)
 bb_	besser82 okay
 besser82	bb_: but i have a fast uplink  ;)
 bb_	besser82 yeah i am thinking i should cancel the link for downloading fedora ... lol
 bb_	besser82 thanks hoping that fedora has fixed all the issues that have plagued them
 besser82	bb_: for sure  :D
 besser82	bb_: This version is directly derived from upcoming RHEL 7  :D
 besser82	bb_: do you need 64-Bit or 32-Bit?
 besser82	bb_: and please:  DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE!!!
 bb_	besser82 64-bit i will not
 besser82	bb_: kk, will be there in short....
 besser82	bb_: you have some ftp where I can upload or such?
 besser82	bb_: or shall I upload to some och?
 bb_	besser82 not, you can upload it to some och
 besser82	bb_: any prefered one? where you have premium?
 bb_	besser82 i dont have any can we not share files through irc
 bb_	besser82 i thought there was a way
 besser82	bb_: there might be, but that is slow and need opened firewall / nat
 besser82	bb_: how about torrent?
 besser82	bb_: would be the easiest way....
 bb_	besser82 how big is the file
 besser82	bb_: ~ 1 GByte
 besser82	bb_: I'm on 12 MBit/s upload ;)
 bb_	besser82 how about something like this http://www.filedropper.com/
 besser82	bb_: kk will use that ;)
 besser82	bb_: build should be finished within next 5 mins
 bb_	besser82 fedora still has 25 mins
 besser82	bb_: ok, so you will get my files before install is finished  ;)
 bb_	besser82 looks like that for now...
 besser82	bb_: btw. build from recent checkout (will be in fedora next week) and with SVM^shit built-in  ;)
 besser82	bb_: I call it that way because the license is crap
 bb_	besser82 okay thanks
 bb_	besser82 if somebody could do that same on osx that would be awesome
 besser82	bb_: I'm not able to, unfortunately  :(
 besser82	bb_: started upload  ;)
