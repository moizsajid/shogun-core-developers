 sanuj	HeikoS: there?
@HeikoS	half :)
 sanuj	okay :)
 sanuj	just wanted to update you
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/tests/tests.cpp
 sanuj	HeikoS: tags are working
 sanuj	i need to add SWIG which i'll do as soon as i get time
 sanuj	i finished tags about a week back
 sanuj	busy with course work and assignments right now
 sanuj	also
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3146
 sanuj	HeikoS: how do we go about adding graphical examples to tests
 sanuj	one by one or all in one PR
 sanuj	one by one could be dirty, i'll just loop over all graphical examples in the folder if we add all in one PR
@HeikoS	ill get back in a second :)
 sanuj	HeikoS: sure, take your time :)

@HeikoS	sanuj: ok reading
@HeikoS	sanuj: definintely examples one by one
@HeikoS	BUT the examples should not be touched by this
@HeikoS	cmake should do the trick
@HeikoS	hey great about the tags
@HeikoS	getting swig to work is important, curious how that goes
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	so this implementation mostly followed the initial draft by lisitsyn right?
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah
 sanuj	HeikoS: i keep discussing things with sergey so he is fine with the implementation
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	well done :)
 sanuj	besser82: hi :)
@HeikoS	swig will be tricky
 sanuj	HeikoS: thanks, i know
@HeikoS	sanuj: btw, designing a proper shogun base interface will also be quite important
@HeikoS	we want to nicely represent all ML in shogun, being flexible to add, but not overly complex
@HeikoS	anyways, gotta go. see you guys later!
 sanuj	HeikoS: i plan to do that...step by step
 sanuj	HeikoS: take care :)
