 thoralf	HeikoS1: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20140625-2038.html
 thoralf	HeikoS1: You know who worked on LDA?
 HeikoS1	yes
 HeikoS1	kislay
 HeikoS1	ill mail him
 thoralf	Thanks :)
 thoralf	HeikoS1: I tried to write a small example for the workshop, but I just realized this guy is still open: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1991
 HeikoS1	thoralf: does this block you?
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Not really, I can use smaller examples.
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Bug if someone comes with a bigger file and we need to tell him "sorry, it's broken for months - please use files < 10 MB"
 thoralf	But
 thoralf	IMO this is a show stopper.

 HeikoS1	thoralf: yeah totally
 HeikoS1	thoralf: maybe we should have a list of bugs that should be fixed until workshop ;)

 thoralf	That was easy. ;)
 thoralf	Now we need somebody to fix this. ;)

 jiaolong	hushell: Hello
 hushell	jiaolong: hey man
 jiaolong	I have found the memory leak is from https://github.com/Jiaolong/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/structure/GraphCut.cpp#L66
 jiaolong	We should remove REF(fac)
 hushell	ok, try it
 jiaolong	Now, I have run valgrind to the unit-test again
 jiaolong	==5337== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==5337== Copyright (C) 2002-2013, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==5337== Using Valgrind-3.10.0.SVN and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info ==5337== Command: ./shogun-unit-test --gtest_filter=Graph* ==5337==  Note: Google Test filter = Graph* [==========] Running 4 tests from 1 test case. [----------] Global test environment set-up. [----------] 4 tests from GraphCut [ RUN    
 hushell	jiaolong: sounds great! send a PR when you tested it
 jiaolong	hushell: Sorry, I juts pasted the output
 jiaolong	hushell: It looks urgly :(
 jiaolong	hushell: But the unit-test should be fixed
 jiaolong	hushell: However, I still have a dout
 hushell	seems still an error out there
 hushell	paste the output of valgrind or send me an email
 jiaolong	All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
 jiaolong	hushell: OK
 jiaolong	hushell:  sent you email
 jiaolong	hushell: Is it OK?
 jiaolong	hushell: I sent you another email which is from coverity scan report several days ago
 jiaolong	hushell: It reports >>>     CID 68404:  Unchecked dynamic_cast  (FORWARD_NULL)
 jiaolong	hushell: >>>     Assigning: "fac" = "dynamic_cast <shogun::CFactor *>(facs->get_element(i))".
 jiaolong	hushell: So I added REF(fac) to solve this issue
 hushell	jiaolong: hold on a sec
 jiaolong	hushell: Now it seems REF(fac) should never be added here. Then I am usurious about what is the solution to  CID 68404:  Unchecked dynamic_cast  (FORWARD_NULL)
 jiaolong	hushell: OK
 hushell	jiaolong: mem leak has been solved, isn't it
 jiaolong	hushell: yeah
 hushell	what's the 2nd issue?
 jiaolong	hushell: Let's look back the coverity scan report
 jiaolong	hushell: In fact, in my original PR, I removed REF(fac)
 hushell	jiaolong: you sent a PR for it, isn't it?
 hushell	jiaolong: no worry, no need to add ref here
 hushell	if everything is fine
 jiaolong	hushell: Since coverity scan reports >>>     Assigning: "fac" = "dynamic_cast <shogun::CFactor *>(facs->get_element(i))".
 jiaolong	hushell: I added REF(fac) back later, which was wrong
 jiaolong	hushell: yes
 hushell	that issue was because you use m_fg->get_num_factors()
 jiaolong	hushell: OK
 hushell	but in fact, this number may not match to the real numer
 jiaolong	hushell: Now, it is clear
 shogun-buildbot	build #354 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/354  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Saurabh <saurabh.mahindre@gmail.com>
 jiaolong	hushell: So, I will send a PR soon
 hushell	reference Thoralf or Fernando to merge your PR
 jiaolong	OK
 jiaolong	hushell: Thanks!
 hushell	jiaolong: enjoy your trip!
 jiaolong	hushell: Thanks!
 jiaolong	hushell: BTW
 jiaolong	hushell: I haven't fixed the hinge_loss < 0 issue in the sossvm
 jiaolong	hushell: I have checked the energy
-!- soumyaC [uid15286@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-ckgyaaioukbawsdv] has quit [Quit: Connection closed for inactivity]
 jiaolong	hushell: The graph cuts and tree max product produces similar energy values
 hushell	jiaolong: sure? check BeliefPropagation.cpp
 jiaolong	hushell: I mean, they are negative values
 hushell	jiaolong: yes, this is why needs -energy
 hushell	jiaolong: yes, then you need to make them positive
 jiaolong	hushell: But, tree max product is still exact inference, right?
 jiaolong	hushell: wait
 hushell	jiaolong: in fact, in log-scale, it's min-sum
 jiaolong	hushell: you mean make graph cuts energy value positive?
 hushell	jiaolong: check what I did in BeliefP...cpp
 jiaolong	hushell: it is not exactly the same
 jiaolong	hushell: you computed the energy from MAP
 hushell	yes, min energy, so you want to get as negative as possible
 jiaolong	hushell: but I computed the energy directly from the assignment
 hushell	on the other hand, MAP needs to reverse the sign
 jiaolong	hushell: yeah, that's why you need - energy
 jiaolong	hushell: but in my case, it is different
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 hushell	jiaolong: exp(-E(y,x))
 hushell	jiaolong: GC is the same as min-sum
 jiaolong	hushell: well, the bug actually is not related to the energy value return by inference()
 hushell	MAP is exp(-E()), so need -energy in fact
 jiaolong	hushell: we never use this value in argmax()
 jiaolong	hushell: I think the problem is the way we get the assignment
 jiaolong	hushell: I mean, whether we get the assigment from a max(obj_fun) or min(obj_func)
 hushell	jiaolong: look at FactorGraphModel.cpp:342
 hushell	jiaolong: where it's called
 hushell	I know the energy min and MAP is confusing
 hushell	I need to clarify a bit more in the code
 jiaolong	hushell: OK
 jiaolong	hushell: No worry, it may have other reasons
 jiaolong	hushell: I have got some hint
 hushell	jiaolong: I still think in GraphCut.cpp:176, should return -energy
 jiaolong	hushell: I think energy min and MAP is clear
 jiaolong	hushell: I need to check "CFactorGraphObservation* y_star = infer_met.get_structured_outputs();"
 jiaolong	hushell: OK, thanks for your advises
 jiaolong	hushell: I will check them later
 hushell	jiaolong: great! Talk u later, have a good night!
 jiaolong	hushell: see you!

 yorkerlin	I think I correct a bug but forget to change in unit test.
 yorkerlin	EXPECT_EQ(CMath::get_abs_tolorance(0.0, 0.01), 0.01);    should be right
 yorkerlin	abs_tolorance = true_value * rel_tolorance usually.
 yorkerlin	but when true_value equals to 0, abs_tolorance should be the same as rel_tolorance
 HeikoS1	yorkerlin: ok, please update and tell me that test passes locally - then I will merge
 yorkerlin	btw do travis fix the bug in python modual now. I usually take a look at the flag of travis but once the python modual issue. I forget to check the result. sorry about that
 yorkerlin	I usually take a look at the flag of travis. Since the python code issue leads to the red flag, I forget to check the detailed information of building failure
 HeikoS1	yorkerlin: thats what we have travis for :)
 HeikoS1	yorkerlin: I gotta go now, will check back tomorrow how things are going
