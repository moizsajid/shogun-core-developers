 vig	I have some problems installing shogun for python on my linux machine
 vig	anyone here can help me out?
 vig	I installed using cmake and I keep getting no package called sg found error
 vig	what could be the problem?
 abinash_panda	vig: Hi!
 abinash_panda	vig: Can you give the details of the error that you are receiving?
 vig	Hey Abinash, there was a problem with the path. I figured it out, or at least I hope I did. Make is currently running.
 vig	So I should have it installed shortly.
 vig	So I am getting the same error again.
 abinash_panda	vig: Okay.
 vig	It isn't able to import the module name sg
 abinash_panda	vig: It would be easier if you could send the error message.
 abinash_panda	vig: You can paste the error in pastebin and send the link.
 vig	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "svm_classification.py", line 1, in <module>     from sg import sg ImportError: No module named sg
 abinash_panda	vig: Okay.
 abinash_panda	vig: So did you build the shogun with python-static?
 vig	yes I did
 abinash_panda	Could you please send the cmake command you used?
 vig	I went to the directory where I downloaded shogun
 vig	created a directory named build
 vig	then did cmake ..
 vig	which is what the readme file asked me to do
 abinash_panda	Okay. So for building python-static interface of shogun you need to provide some extra arugements to cmake.
 abinash_panda	vig: Give me a minute, I am sending you the actual command.
 vig	Sure! That's great thanks
 vig	Also I have a question
 abinash_panda	vig: cmake -DPythonStatic=ON ..
 vig	say I downloaded shogun, I have to run cmake immediately within the directory right?
 vig	yes that's what I did.
 abinash_panda	No
 abinash_panda	After downloading the library
 abinash_panda	Create a directory build
 abinash_panda	and within the build directory use cmake -DPythonStatic=ON ..
 vig	within the library directory?
 abinash_panda	not within the library directory but within the build directory that you have just created.
 vig	I create the build directory within the library directory right?
 abinash_panda	yeah.
 abinash_panda	Okay. I think I am confusing you.
 vig	I did that
 vig	and it says
 abinash_panda	Let me give the steps one by one.
 vig	Configuring done -- Generating done -- Build files have been written to: /home/vignesh/shogun-3.2.0/build
 abinash_panda	So now are you able to build or not?
 abinash_panda	Or should I give you the steps one by one?
 vig	Could you do that?
 vig	It would be really helpful.
 abinash_panda	Yeah. Sure.
 abinash_panda	1. Download (or clone) the library.
 abinash_panda	2. Create a directory called build within the library directory.
 abinash_panda	3. Go to the build directory (cd build)
 abinash_panda	4. Use cmake -DPythonStatic=ON ..
 abinash_panda	5. Then make
 abinash_panda	6. Finally (sudo) make install
 vig	once I do this, will I be able to import sg from any location?
 abinash_panda	Yeah.
 vig	Thanks a lot! I'll try this and get back if it doesn't work out. I think I did this the last time around too.
 vig	Not sure why it wouldn't work
 abinash_panda	Yeah. Sure. If you are still facing the same issue then put it in the mailing list or create an issue in github.
 vig	Thanks a lot :)
 vig	I did make install
 vig	i tried import sg after opening python
 vig	it still says the same
 vig	In my usr/local/lib there are files named libshogun.so
 vig	and similar
 abinash_panda	Okay.
 abinash_panda	Let me try to reproduce this in my end.
 vig	Please do thanks a lot.
 abinash_panda	vig: Hey sorry. I didn't know how to use PyhtonStatic so I said you earlier that it could be used from anywhere.
 abinash_panda	Once the build is successfull you can find libpython_static.so in build/src/interfaces/python_static
 vig	okay
 vig	how do I import?
 vig	I have a python script that has a 'from shogun import *
 abinash_panda	Sorry. I can't be much help in that. You can ask someone in mailing list. Mostly I use PythonModular interface.
 vig	could you tell me how I can install for modular interface?
 vig	should I just set the modular flag on?
 abinash_panda	yeah.
 vig	thanks
 abinash_panda	use cmake -DPythonModular=ON ..
 abinash_panda	It works seamlessly and you can call modshogun from anywhere :)
 vig	that's awesome, I'll try that :)
 vig	what is the difference between python static and modular though?
 vig	it says SWIG is not installed

 hshihab	Hi, I am new to SHOGUN, so please bear with me.  I was wondering if the LibSVM solver is related to the LIBSVM package (available here: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).  I have been trying to compare the performance of both methods using a Gaussian kernel and the same C/gamma parameters (having performed a grid search using LIBSVM), but am getting different performances (the accuracy for LIBSVM is 66.83% and for SHOGUN i
 hshihab	Does anyone know what could be causing this discrepancy?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

 marina_	Hello everyone...I want to install shogun on my mac but I have some problems - after 1 hour I got the following error
 marina_	--->  Configuring atlas Selected C compiler: /opt/local/bin/clang-mp-3.4 Error: org.macports.configure for port atlas returned: Atlas could not detect any fortran compiler. If you really don't need the fortran interface to be built, please use the +nofortran option, else install a fortran compiler (e.g. gcc4X) before building Atlas. Error: Failed to install atlas Please see the log file for port atlas for details:     /opt/local/v
 marina_	I am going to use shogun with python - so do I really need to install the fortran compiler -> because I am not going to use fortran...

@besser82	marina_, query  ^^
 marina_	I installed now the fortran compiler...
 marina_	do I have to make the whole installation process again??
 marina_	I followed the 3 points on the installation page:
 marina_	sudo port selfupdate  sudo port install swig -php5 -ruby -perl +python   (shogun users who want the r and octave interfaces should add   +octave and/or +r to this list)  sudo port install shogun   (for r, octave, and elwms interfaces: +r +octave +elwms)
@besser82	marina_, let's continue this in german in the query...  :D
 marina_	do I have to do them again?
 marina_	was meinst du mit query?
@besser82	/query besser82
@besser82	^^ das eingeben und los geht's  ;)

 rujmeister	hello, i am trying to test my build of shogun in Windows and apparently running the example file in command line doesn't work directly since my matplotlib is packaged in ipython. Any suggestions for testing my shogun installation?
 rujmeister	i see now i can access matplotlib from within ipython, so will try to run the test from ipython command line tool. will check back later if stuck.

 rujmeister	when i tried to run the svm.py script from ipython, modshogun was not found. does my path need to be modified to include the whole shogun directory?
 rujmeister	i guess i should have replaced SHOGUN INSTALL DIR with its actual location...  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUN_INSTALL_DIR/lib   $ export PYTHONPATH=SHOGUN_INSTALL_DIR/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages/
