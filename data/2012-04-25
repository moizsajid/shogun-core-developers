 n4nd0	good morning!
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey how was your flight?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it went good
 pluskid	Is it Apr. 25 or Apr. 26 now in your time zone?
 n4nd0	blackburn: first flight ever seen with so many Smith charts :P
 blackburn	pluskid: 25
 n4nd0	25th
 pluskid	so the kick off meeting is on 26th, right?
 blackburn	pluskid: 27 for you probably
 blackburn	orr
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	are you in utc+8?
 pluskid	yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey! about the kickoff meeting, my exam starts at 13:00 UTC tomorrow, I hope there is no trouble with that since it starts 11:00 UTC
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you happen to know how long will it take?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't think it would take more than half of hour
 pluskid	n4nd0: good luck with your exam
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@194.78.35.195] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	pluskid: wait but is it 26th in your timezone?
 n4nd0	pluskid: thank you!
 n4nd0	blackburn: great
 blackburn	I don't think so :)
 blackburn	it should be 15 now?
 pluskid	25th, now, in my time zone
 n4nd0	I will ask sonne|work also just in case
 pluskid	afternoon of 25th
 sonne|work	pluskid: looks like you didn't read the subject of the email
 sonne|work	pluskid: it said 26th
 blackburn	sonne|work: no he is confused with timezones
 blackburn	so we check watches :D
 pluskid	sonne|work: oops, you are right
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.161.188] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	thanks!
 sonne|work	we are all on the same day (25th now)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: is it a problem if my exam tomorrow starts two hours after the kickoff is scheduled? I mean in terms of how long will it be
 blackburn	not two hours definitely
 sonne|work	it is clear from the beginning that not everyone can attend / some will have to leave early
 sonne|work	but I have to leave after 1 hr myself so...
 n4nd0	no worries then :)

 blackburn	like data
 sonne|work	blackburn: of course but you did fail putting your tutorial there :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: tutorial of non-existent toolkit? should take more time to finish it
 sonne|work	yes sure - we have to start somehow right?
 blackburn	sonne|work: what about cherry-picking some stuff from your thesis?
 sonne|work	makes sense but still lots and lots of work...
 blackburn	sonne|work: can I obtain source?
 sonne|work	sure I can give it to you

 blackburn	I should obtain chris' thesis heh
 wiking	damn my machine crashed... :(
 blackburn	wiking: do you think dot product of homogay kernel map can be optimized somehow?
 blackburn	sh I can't stop call it homogay it is not funny at all :D
 wiking	blackburn: well homo gay kernel map should be first extended to the new stuff ;)
 wiking	blackburn: remember the 2 papers i've sent
 blackburn	wiking: I mean they use sin and cos right?
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	so in dot product we could reduce it probably?
 wiking	?
 blackburn	sin(x)*sin(y) = 2 sin(x+y) or so?
 blackburn	1/2
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	no idea if it worths trying
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	now i'm starting to see what you mean ;)
 wiking	could be interesting
 blackburn	wiking: actually it seems we will use some identical multipliers
 blackburn	so may be we can just precompute squares?
 wiking	eh?
 wiking	ok now i'm lost blackburn
 wiking	so expand your story :)
 blackburn	each feature is being multiplied
 blackburn	with sin and cos and 1?
 wiking	not exactly this straightforward
 blackburn	ah I checked code and it is not as simple as I thought hehe
 blackburn	wiking: okay I am lost :D
 blackburn	but the idea stays - is dot product easier to compute than full mapping?
 wiking	it needs to be checked
 blackburn	wiking: have you time for that?
 wiking	yeah no worries
 wiking	i can hope on that train ;P
 blackburn	I'm going to start with slep porting tomorrow
 wiking	yeey

 emrecelikten	Hey guys, what's the primary difference between a Markov chain and a Markov random field? One is a probabilistic FSM while the other is like a undirected Bayesian network?
 n4nd0	emrecelikten, are you just wondering or do you have to choose between both of them for something in particular?
 emrecelikten	n4nd0: Wondering. Could MRFs be applied to speech/music domain like HMMs for example
 emrecelikten	I think so
 n4nd0	emrecelikten, I am not sure, I have never really worked with MRFs far beyond definition and toy examples
 blackburn	emrecelikten: markov chain is a chain right? :)
 blackburn	while random field is a graph structure
 n4nd0	emrecelikten, I don't really see direct application of MRF to it but it might be
 n4nd0	blackburn, isn't it a chain a particular case of directed weighted graph?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes but it is a chain in markov chains - not a graph
 emrecelikten	Hmm thanks
 n4nd0	blackburn, I partially agree, I think that a graph is something more general than a chain
 blackburn	yes exactly what I mean
 n4nd0	but I'd say that a chain is a graph
 blackburn	it is
 blackburn	acyclic with nodes with only two or one output edge ?
 blackburn	something like that I guess
 n4nd0	a Markov chain can be cyclic I think
 blackburn	right sorry
 n4nd0	no problem :)
 blackburn	but no multiple outputs
 n4nd0	yeah, they can have multiple
 n4nd0	if today is sunny
 blackburn	wait but when I am fucked up - what is the difference then?
 n4nd0	tomorrow might be rainy, sunny, cloudy or pouring cats and dogs for example
 n4nd0	there you have more than two output edges
 n4nd0	the difference between which ones?
 blackburn	MC and MRF
 n4nd0	I think MRF are something similar to Bayesian nets
 n4nd0	so for example the graph that represent them is not weighted
 n4nd0	there must be more differences
 n4nd0	at least I have found them in different realms
 blackburn	damn I should get back to markov stuff and study it :D
 blackburn	emrecelikten: probably I am wrong
 n4nd0	I think MRF is more advanced stuff
 n4nd0	one type of probabilistic graphical model
 emrecelikten	blackburn: It's fine :)
 n4nd0	I have to learn more of them for the project since I'll have to implement conditional random fields
 emrecelikten	blackburn: Longtimenostudy effect :P :D
 blackburn	emrecelikten: oh it's been a long without some effects and paradoxes ;)
 emrecelikten	MRF supports higher dimensions I think
 emrecelikten	blackburn: :P

 wiking	mmm
 wiking	pluskid: here?
 pluskid	wiking: hi
 wiking	oh great hi!
 wiking	so i was just wondering about your refactoring of multi class
 wiking	as i'm now implementing the latent svm
 pluskid	so what's your question?
 wiking	it's a derivative of LinearMachine
 wiking	and as a first step it's binary
 pluskid	hmm
 wiking	but if i want to extend it to multi class machine, do we have line LinearMulticlass?
 pluskid	does your latent svm support multiclass *naturally* ?
 pluskid	I mean
 pluskid	for example, traditional svm only support binary case
 pluskid	but we can use one-vs-rest or one-vs-one to make it multiclass
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.2.179] has joined #shogun
 wiking	pluskid: no it does not support multi class naturally
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@vir78-1-82-232-38-145.fbx.proxad.net] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	if your latent svm also rely one one-vs-res or one-vs-one for multiclass
 wiking	but i'd like it to be able to use for multi class case as well
 pluskid	then I guess you don't have to do anything
 wiking	ah ok
 pluskid	because MulticlassLinearMachine can accept a "base linear machine"
 wiking	yeah as a first step i guess it should be OvR OvO
 pluskid	and turn that base linear machine into multiclass
 wiking	ok
 wiking	that's great
 pluskid	there's an example code I guess
 wiking	and in case i can extend it to a true multi class machine?
 wiking	i.e. like a crammer-singer
 pluskid	if it becomes a true multiclass machine, you will derive a subclass from MulticlassLinearMachine
 pluskid	it cannot be subclass of both linearmachine and multiclasslinearmachine
 pluskid	that's our problem
 pluskid	also happens in MulticlassSVM
 wiking	aha
 pluskid	cannot be subclass of SVM and MultickassKernelmachine simultaneously
 wiking	but why not? :)
 pluskid	we do not like multiple inheritance here
 wiking	i mean i guess the current design does not allow it
 wiking	why? :)
-!- n4nd0 [~n4nd0@wifi-cct-cisco-r252-4.cct.urjc.es] has joined #shogun
 wiking	it's not that of a 'big magic' :)
 pluskid	because sonney2k hate multiple inheritance :p
 pluskid	joking haha
 pluskid	I guess if we really want multiple inheritance, we will need "virtual inheritance"
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	not necesarrily
 wiking	but of course it depends a lot on the base classes
 pluskid	because both super class has a common super class (CSGObject)
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	heheh in that case yes
 pluskid	the inheritance graph becoms complicated
 wiking	yeah a diamond inharitance
 pluskid	yes, like std::iostream ? :p
 wiking	anyhow that's another story for later
 wiking	first i want to see how it performs with a OvR setup
 wiking	and as you said that should be fairly easy to do
 pluskid	wiking: check this example
 pluskid	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_multiclasslinearmachine.cpp
 pluskid	it use a LibLinear as a base classifier
 pluskid	and use OneVsOne to turn it into multiclass
 pluskid	what you need is to new a CMulticlassOneVsOneStrategy() haha
 pluskid	there will be ECOC support soon :)
 wiking	great!
 wiking	thanks a lot i'll do the testing with this
 wiking	i mean based on this
 pluskid	:)
 wiking	yeeey this should be fun to see how it performs :)))
 pluskid	I didn't tested the performance of the shogun machines really
 pluskid	be back in a while
 blackburn	wiking: hey what is your issue?
 wiking	blackburn: well i just want to have multi class support for latent svm ;)
 blackburn	wiking: hmm can you describe in a few words how does it extend?
 wiking	well currently as you can see only with OvR
 wiking	but i must check whether i can use crammer-singer
 wiking	but as for now i don't see a problem with it
 blackburn	wiking: crammer-singer is done in both ocas and liblinear multiclass svms
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	and since i currently use ocas
 wiking	it should be fine
 blackburn	wiking: I already asked vojtech about some improvement of ocas btw
 wiking	but then i guess i have to the the 'reimplementation' of latent svm
 blackburn	I need to solve 0.5||w||^2 + <w0,w> + C \sum_i \xi_i problems
 wiking	as current implementation is derived from linearmachine
 blackburn	(domain adaptation)
 blackburn	wiking: yes sad truth
 wiking	ah w_0 is the input learned w?
 blackburn	linear machine is pretty 'far away' from linearmulticlassmachine
 blackburn	wiking: yes kind of pre-svm
 blackburn	source domain svm
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	(but in multiclass case)
 blackburn	so \sum_m w_m everywhere
 wiking	btw: i see that we have SVMOcas for binary case
 wiking	but there's no such for multi class case
 wiking	ah no
 wiking	i'm wrong
 wiking	we do
 blackburn	wiking: multiclass/MulticlassOCAS
 wiking	yes yes found it sorry
 blackburn	wiking: I have pretty recently implemented it actually
 wiking	that should be interesting to test
 wiking	i'll have to change the api of my implementation as far as i can see
 wiking	since maybe the best thing is to somehow supply the svm you want to use
 wiking	for latent svm
 wiking	but i'm wondering how will an s-svm look like
 wiking	n4nd0 will tell me more about that soon ;)
 blackburn	yeah once he is finished with some univ stuff :)
 n4nd0	yeah :)
 wiking	:>>>
 n4nd0	wiking, in any case, yesterday I devoted some time to read some of the Struct SVM's doc
-!- pluskid_ [~chatzilla@111.120.57.192] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	wiking, I like some of the diagrams they have there and I think that it is exactly what we want to do in shogun
 wiking	:))))
 n4nd0	I am waiting for an answer from Nico to know that though
 n4nd0	wiking, have you taken a look to Struct SVM?
 wiking	yep
 n4nd0	cool
-!- pluskid [~chatzilla@173.254.214.60] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 wiking	currently i'm doing runs
 blackburn	n4nd0: which diagrams?
 wiking	my implementation vs the other latent implementation
-!- pluskid_ is now known as pluskid
 n4nd0	blackburn, a moment
 wiking	that is based on structsvm
 wiking	but i just have -1,1 labeling so i don't use SO
 n4nd0	blackburn, just scroll down a bit http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_struct.html
 n4nd0	wiking, I have to think about how to fit into shogun the labels hierarchy we need for SO
 blackburn	hmm where?
 wiking	n4nd0: i'm changing as well labels...
 wiking	since i have latent output
 wiking	so it might be good to talk about it when u have some time
 blackburn	n4nd0: are you sure it is the link?
 n4nd0	blackburn, maybe diagrams is a bad word to refer to them
 blackburn	I see only text :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, the "coloured boxes" on the left with arrows in between
 n4nd0	a wait
 n4nd0	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/svmpython2/
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	the link remains the same in the browser's textbox for the address :D
 blackburn	yes any kind of diagrams help
 n4nd0	I think that SVM struct is a good reference for what we want to do
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes yes
 n4nd0	but I wonder if I got something wrong since it was not referenced in the project ideas
 blackburn	pretty general
 n4nd0	that's why I asked Nico about it, just to be sure
 blackburn	hmm I don't think thorsten has fucked up
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: wiking: it should be of interest right? http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_struct.html
 wiking	blackburn: well yeah that's a typical structural svm
 blackburn	I am very excited about having all that jazz in shogun
 wiking	hehehe
 n4nd0	it's going to be very cool
 pluskid	what will you use as labels in SO learning?
 pluskid	I mean the current CLabels wouldn't be enough to describe structures
 wiking	pluskid: yeah it needs to be extended
 wiking	btw when are we planning to do a release?
 wiking	i mean shogun release
 pluskid	any concrete idea? I'm thinking of extending CLabels for multiclass, too. though it can support multiclass in the current status
 blackburn	pluskid: yes would be nice to have multiclass lables
 blackburn	probabilities is the thing we can store there
 blackburn	wiking: that would be hard to release before end of gsoc currently
 wiking	heheh ok
 wiking	afaik the last release was 8 months ago
 blackburn	however this can be done
 wiking	and there's a lot of improvement/fixes since then
 blackburn	yes but we are in unstable state
 wiking	true
 blackburn	all is broken
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	api is changing a lot :))
 pluskid	have you considered some benchmark test for our machines in shogun?
 blackburn	I'd call it shogun 2.0
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	pluskid: what to benchmark?
 pluskid	for examples, all the examples only run classification etc.
 wiking	pluskid: i do with my own...
 pluskid	but do not evaluate
 blackburn	performance evaluation?
 pluskid	yes
 pluskid	that would also be a good reference when we are doing refactoring of the code
 pluskid	if the performance are different before and after, there must be something wrong
 blackburn	ah you mean to compare things using there benchmarks?
 pluskid	yes
 blackburn	I don't think it would work very well
 pluskid	and this is also useful for the users to choose machines to use
 pluskid	blackburn: why?
 blackburn	pluskid: what would you measure for classifiers?
 pluskid	for example, accuracy on a standard dataset
 blackburn	but why not to compare learned parameters?
 pluskid	for the purpose of refactoring, your way is better. But performance is more intuitive to see, and has other uses
 pluskid	I mean, for example, I'm a user
 pluskid	of shogun
 blackburn	pluskid: where would you like to add it?
 pluskid	I downloaded the shogun, compile it and run the example code
 pluskid	when I see it produces performance as indicated in the reference, I would be sure that everything is fine, and I can start my work
 pluskid	blackburn: no idea yet, just thinking about this :p

 pluskid	hmm, make sense
 blackburn	the problem is
 blackburn	how to implement it
 blackburn	we have get_labels()
 blackburn	what should it return?
 blackburn	I see templates as a choice actually
 pluskid	get_labels() is a function of what object?
 blackburn	of labels
 blackburn	or get_label(i)
 pluskid	sonney2k might hate template? :p
 blackburn	no, I don't think
 blackburn	I can't see any other way
 blackburn	pluskid: how did you draw it?
 pluskid	blackburn: http://yuml.me/edit/f14284c4
 blackburn	all the uml stuff is so damn heavy
 blackburn	that's fscking awesome
 pluskid	haha
 pluskid	this is not *drawing* , though :p
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	you can include LatentLabels as well ;P
 wiking	and it's not drawing for me
 pluskid	wiking: what would a latent label looks like?
 wiking	pluskid: well it can be basically anything
 wiking	it's user defined
 pluskid	hmm
 wiking	since the latent variable should be defined by the user
 blackburn	we are going to have great hierarchy there
 blackburn	I am afraid we need shogun/labels
 pluskid	yes, I feel very strange the first time when I found CLabels in features folder :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is going to be tough to support back compatibility for this release
 blackburn	everything will be broken
 wiking	pluskid: did the yuml.me code generate you the diagram?
 pluskid	maybe everything is already broken ? :p
 blackburn	is already and will be more
 pluskid	wiking: yes, scroll down the page you will see links to the pictures
 pluskid	of various type, png, pdf, jpg, svg, etc
 wiking	lool
 wiking	yeah that works
 wiking	but not within the page
 blackburn	pluskid: would you mind describing multiclass part @ wikipedia?
 pluskid	wikipedia of shogun?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_(toolbox)
 wiking	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_(toolbox)
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	funny
 wiking	it missed for me the )
 pluskid	hmm, OK
 pluskid	I'll update it after I add each new multiclass support

 blackburn	I'm going to add some dim reduction part there once
 blackburn	simply lets make it best article of wikipedia
 pluskid	haha
 pluskid	ambitious goal
 blackburn	no - we know this field
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	n4nd0: wiking: join me in this effort ;)
 wiking	hehehehe
 pluskid	here's some pseudo code: https://gist.github.com/2489859
 pluskid	of new CLabels
 blackburn	we need promotion - it worths doing
 pluskid	but the problem is that
 blackburn	in the end your names will be well known :)
 pluskid	if we use template here, they no longer share a *single* super class
 blackburn	pluskid: I would skip binary labels
 blackburn	it is inconvient at some point
 blackburn	i.e. you train svm using binary
 blackburn	but it will always return real
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	that's why we have both LabelStoreType and LabelType template variable
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	brb

 n4nd0	blackburn, wiking: Nico has approved the diagrams I linked you guys, svm struct may be an inspiration for our SO base
 wiking	hehehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: heh
 blackburn	nice
 wiking	can u do a sketch of that
 wiking	how that actually would look like in case of shogun
* wiking is lazy  ;)
 n4nd0	wiking, yes, we have discussed and would like to prepare some UML diagrams and stuff
 wiking	i mean in my case
 wiking	i'm using psi function as well
 wiking	but it's
 wiking	PSI(x,y,h)
 n4nd0	what is your h?
 wiking	so "maybe" it's a good idea to sync
 wiking	h = latent variable
 n4nd0	yes, it's a good idea
 n4nd0	I don't know much about latent variables but
 wiking	n4nd0: psi is defined by the user right?
 wiking	n4nd0: i mean in case of SO
 n4nd0	wiking, yes
 wiking	so you'll have somewhere in the class of features or something
 wiking	that is user defined
 n4nd0	wiking, just a kind of interface hast to be followed
 wiking	currently my CLatentFeatures is something like that
 wiking	you add x, y and h
 wiking	and you have to define PSI
 wiking	so maybe that could be used
 wiking	just then we need to rename it
 wiking	so that it works for SO
 wiking	PSI(x,y)
 n4nd0	I think that for SO h should be within x
 n4nd0	I mean, the general algorithm shouldn't really case whether some features there are latent or not right?
 n4nd0	really care*, sorry
 wiking	well
 wiking	you can take it like that as well
 n4nd0	for me it looks more unified in that way, what do you think?
 wiking	the idea i had is just that we make a new feature or whatever for SO
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.189.186] has joined #shogun
 wiking	and from that i'll inherit latent... to be able to introduce the latent variable
 wiking	because not CLatentFeatures : public CDotFeatures
 wiking	*now
 wiking	s/not/now/g ;)
 n4nd0	:)
 wiking	so i guess you'd do the same
 wiking	but only have x and y
 wiking	where y can be more than a simple -1,1
 n4nd0	why to inherit from CDotFeatures?
 wiking	and you'll need to be able to define the delta(y,y') as well somehow
 wiking	w*PSI(x,y)
 wiking	or in other way <w, PSI(x,y)>
 wiking	so that's a dot product
 n4nd0	my plan is to have a general class for the labels where that class has a pure virtual method for the cost function (this delta(y, y'))
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	that's cool
 n4nd0	what I have not clear yet is where this class should fit
 wiking	so in case of any application of SO
 n4nd0	if inheriting from sth else in Shogun or not
 wiking	you'd need to derive from that class and define that pure virtual func
 n4nd0	exactly
 wiking	well
 wiking	that good but then again
 wiking	you can start the refactoring on the level of CLabels
 wiking	so that CLabels has a delta as well or? :)
 n4nd0	yes, I wanted to check thoroughly the hierarchy there
 wiking	i mean it's straightforward what is the delta
 n4nd0	wiking, but it is application dependent again
 n4nd0	wiking, or at least dependent on the structure used for the labels
 pluskid	that's why we need SequenceLabels, TreeLabels, etc. etc. :p
 n4nd0	pluskid, those should inherit from this general class labels
 pluskid	yes, did you see the figure and pseudo code?
 n4nd0	oh, I think I missed that
 pluskid	yuml.me/f14284c4.jpg
 pluskid	and https://gist.github.com/2489859
 pluskid	very preliminary, though
 pluskid	and there's a problem of using template here: the superclass CLabels is no longer *one* class
 pluskid	but many many classes depending on the template parameter
 pluskid	so maybe we will not use this type of hierarchy, not sure currently
 n4nd0	pluskid, mmm I don't understand why do you want to have the base class CLabels templated
 pluskid	n4nd0: otherwise, we do not know what to return in the function get_label(int32_t)
 pluskid	it might be int, float, or some tree or sequence
 pluskid	will be complex object in SO I guess
 n4nd0	pluskid, well but one should know in the moment of using that function
 n4nd0	should know it*
 pluskid	n4nd0: but how do you define the prototype of that function?
 pluskid	in a common superclass CLabels
 n4nd0	pluskid, doing something similar to what we have in CFeatures
 pluskid	n4nd0: what's that?
 pluskid	you mean we do not define this function in the base class
 pluskid	but we dynamic_cast to subclasses when calling some specific functions?
 n4nd0	pluskid, wait a second I am looking for an example within the code so you can see what I mean
 pluskid	ok
 n4nd0	yes my idea would be to dynamic_cast to subclasses
 blackburn	we don't really need base CLabels
 blackburn	multiclass work with multiclass labels (only)
 pluskid	OK, I understand
 blackburn	binary with binary
 blackburn	however this can be a problem again
 blackburn	cause we have generic machine
 n4nd0	blackburn, but there might some common functionality to all of them interesting to have in a base class
 pluskid	what is generic machine?
 blackburn	CMachine
 blackburn	it has labels..
 n4nd0	blackburn, and I think it offers more flexibility to have a base class
 pluskid	we can have a pure virtual CLabel super class
 pluskid	with almost nothing in it
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	yes but we have to be careful
 n4nd0	I imagine it like that
 n4nd0	blackburn, in what sense?
 blackburn	with future casts
 n4nd0	can you put an example where a problem may arise?
 blackburn	n4nd0: it would be nice to have set_labels(MulticlassLabels) for multiclass machines
 blackburn	but how to do that?
 blackburn	no way probably so it should be checked probably
 pluskid	yes dynamic_cast everywhere
 blackburn	pluskid: n4nd0: wiking: could you please elaborate tihs problem at the mailing list?
 n4nd0	blackburn, sure, but I have to think more of it first
 blackburn	yes no hurry
 wiking	hehehe ok
 wiking	brb
 pluskid	sure
 blackburn	but we all can forget something so would be nice to have it on the mailing list
 blackburn	thanls
 blackburn	ks*
 n4nd0	pluskid, blackburn, also, as far as I have understand from SO, SO generalizes multiclass
 pluskid	doesn't shogun has an issue list?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	pluskid: github issues work well too
 blackburn	feel free to use it
 blackburn	may be even better
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	blackburn: no body looks at it I guess? :p
 n4nd0	I think that should be reflected in the diagram somehow
 blackburn	pluskid: will if it is used
 pluskid	n4nd0: in my view, SO is multiclass, with structure in the class space
 blackburn	n4nd0: pluskid: please create new issue - we can even refer code modifications to it
 blackburn	multiclass is SO I'd say
 blackburn	ehmm
 blackburn	subset of SO
 n4nd0	I agree with blackburn
 blackburn	simple finite
 pluskid	yes, SO without structure haha
 blackburn	no there are some structure
 blackburn	just like structure of N set
 blackburn	there is an order and distance
 pluskid	no, simple discrete set
 pluskid	I don't think there is order in generic multiclass
 blackburn	however d(y,y') = [y=y'] is strange distance
 pluskid	class 1 is not before class 2
 blackburn	heh right
 blackburn	no reason to keep it in mind
 n4nd0	there is no really structure in the sense that is important for SO where there are important dependencies between the parts that form a label
 blackburn	I just thought of implementation
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	actually it can be considered as consistent way
 blackburn	to define distance between numbers
 blackburn	like in multiclass
 pluskid	regression can also be thought to be multiclass: with infinite number of classes, and very nice structure (orders, distance, innerproduct, etc.) in the real line :p
 blackburn	brb
 pluskid	midnight here
 pluskid	good night all
@sonney2k	wtf
 n4nd0	pluskid, good night
@sonney2k	you all are going berserk here?
 n4nd0	:DD
@sonney2k	I can hardly read the whole log
@sonney2k	pluskid, indeed no to multiple inheritance
 n4nd0	I am just preparing by databases exam for tomorrow :P
@sonney2k	it will complicate things beyond repair
@sonney2k	and I cannot even think of how one could possibly use swig with that
 pluskid	sonney2k: OK, I'll tell wiking that if he wants to use multiple inheritance, sonney2k will kill him :D
@sonney2k	(think java, python that all have no MI)
@sonney2k	I will kill everyone who wants MI
 pluskid	:D

@sonney2k	pluskid, n8
@sonney2k	blackburn, about the label redesign - I am very much in favor of it - but I have no idea how we even can have an interface there
@sonney2k	I mean basically multiclass, binary and real-valued labels share all functionality
@sonney2k	only that they accept different values
 n4nd0	sonney2k, I know that I am on risk of getting killed but ... I think python supports MI
@sonney2k	like +1/-1
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html
 n4nd0	search for multiple inheritance
 n4nd0	limited form of it they say
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah but look at it - you will more likely shoot yourself in the foot then benefiting from this
 n4nd0	but it exists :)
 n4nd0	this is awesome
 n4nd0	"all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships"

@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I've seen you label class hierarchy
@sonney2k	which functions should go into the new CLabels?
 blackburn	sonney2k: mine? it was pluskid's I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: this should be discussed actually
 blackburn	about 1000 things - yes but we have enough horsepower^W human resources
 blackburn	so it is a question of management :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: one guy from my school is this year's gsoc student - so a chance I'll get some opencv expert in touch
@sonney2k	blackburn, because I think what we currently have in CLabels would work for binary/multiclass/reallabels
@sonney2k	only that we should have some check_consistency / validity of the labels function
 blackburn	sonney2k: I agree but what about structured labels..
@sonney2k	they are totally different
@sonney2k	there is nothing except checking 'is_valid()' that they have in common
@sonney2k	I mean even get_label() cannot be shared among label classes
@sonney2k	so it cannot be in the new CLabels()
@sonney2k	so I am actually not so sure if we really need a CLabels base class
 blackburn	agree
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually it could be shared using templates
 blackburn	but some non-trivial thing

 blackburn_	sonney2k: isn't it?
@sonney2k	of course not
 blackburn_	that's crazy
@sonney2k	blackburn_, that is why svmlight is not part of official shogun
 blackburn_	sonney2k: yes I know it has some special status
 blackburn_	can SLEP has similar one then?
@sonney2k	and I was begging TJ for way too many times - he simply doesn't like OSS
@sonney2k	blackburn_, ask them: tell them that shogun is under GPLv3 and that you need a statement saying SLEP is released under a GPL3 compatible license or under GPL3 directly
 blackburn_	sonney2k: can reimplementation of anything has different license?
@sonney2k	gsomix, let me think loudly: If we were using pointers we would keep ptrs everywhere.
 blackburn_	sonney2k: yeah I asked already but not about statement - lets wait for answer first
@sonney2k	blackburn_, re-implementing without using / looking at their code - of course
 blackburn_	sonney2k: that license stuff is pretty vomitting isn't it?
@sonney2k	blackburn_, sure it is - in particular because even OSS licenses might conflict with each other - so we cannot use MPL / CPL licensed code in shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, so in principle we want exactly that - pass around object ptrs only
 blackburn_	lets hope they will license it using gpl
 blackburn_	I think to allow to be integrated to shogun is the only way to survive :D
@sonney2k	gsomix, now when we have a function SGVector return_new_vector() we have to return some copy
@sonney2k	gsomix, but otherwise we return the reference SGVector& return_vector_from_class()
