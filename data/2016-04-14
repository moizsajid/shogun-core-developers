 arianepaola	hello wiking
@wiking	arianepaola: can i help u with anything? :)
 arianepaola	wiking: yes, regarding https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3131 Do you know how I can call / force a source download for rpmbuild?
@wiking	ah you mean to use the latest git HEAD?

@wiking	HeikoS: ping
@HeikoS	wiking: hi
@HeikoS	just announcing on mailing list :)
@wiking	heheh good pause
@HeikoS	wiking: btw what about website?
@wiking	shwhich?
@wiking	beta?
@wiking	or just in general
@HeikoS	beta yes
@HeikoS	the new
@wiking	mmm the ball is on lisitsyn's side
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how is the ball doing?
@HeikoS	wiking: do you know of any quadratic program solver in c++ that is bsd?
@HeikoS	nothing fancy, strictly convex with equality constraints and <=0 constraints
@wiking	okok wait
@wiking	yeah sure
@wiking	mine
@wiking	:))))
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: COMING
 lisitsyn	the ball is on the fly
 lisitsyn	a bit slow fly though!
@HeikoS	timelapse
@HeikoS	wiking: where is that? :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I think you are going backwards in time with the ball throwing ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw how did you lectures go?
@wiking	:D
@wiking	go lectures \o/
@wiking	motherfucking memory managed languages :)
@HeikoS	wiking: where is da solver?
@wiking	ah laptop
@wiking	ok we need to put it in shogun
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	what do we want to replace?
@HeikoS	I was hijacking libqp
@HeikoS	previously
@wiking	aaaah
@HeikoS	but that is gpl
@wiking	so we wanna get rid of libqp?
@HeikoS	but libqp is an overkill
@wiking	i mean replace
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	leave that
@HeikoS	its needed some something else
@HeikoS	vojtechs stuff
@HeikoS	all gpl
@wiking	non-shogun stuff?
@wiking	or shogun related?
@HeikoS	but I need a cvx solver
@HeikoS	yes in shogun
@wiking	for which thing?
@HeikoS	learning the optimal kernel for kernel mmd
@HeikoS	works via solving a xQx program
@wiking	would a conic qp do it?
@HeikoS	currently uses libqp
@HeikoS	this is the problem
@wiking	yep got it
@HeikoS	minimize xQx -ax     st  Ax=b     x<=0
@wiking	yeye
@wiking	that'd do it
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	Q is strictly posdef
@HeikoS	cool, so push it :D
@wiking	ok i'll see Wu's optimization fw
@wiking	:)
@wiking	how i can put shit into that
@HeikoS	I think that currently onls does first order
@HeikoS	but yeah thats what I though tas well
@HeikoS	would be best
@wiking	but we needo
@HeikoS	to have it there
@wiking	different factorization methods
@wiking	hows linalg doing there?
@HeikoS	no good
@HeikoS	just cholesky is in
@wiking	do we have like LLP?
@wiking	or LDL
@HeikoS	LLT
@wiking	nyippo
@wiking	ok
@HeikoS	its easy to add more
@wiking	yep yep
@wiking	needs addition
@wiking	should be doable
@wiking	cool
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	not too urgent but I guess would be good to have that
@HeikoS	there is no such solver around (in BSD)
@wiking	qr?
@wiking	or nothing
@wiking	like that
@wiking	only llt
@HeikoS	we can maybe even optimize a bit and use GPU
@HeikoS	linalg only has llt
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	but it wraps eigen so its trivial to add the others
@wiking	that's why i want to have a modular decompisition
@wiking	methods
@HeikoS	yes I want that too
@HeikoS	for GP
@wiking	this way you can swap around GPU
@HeikoS	uses LLT, QR, LU all the time
@wiking	without to much hassle
@HeikoS	abslutely
@wiking	yeah there it woudl make total sense as well
@HeikoS	Wu will marry you if you add these :D
@HeikoS	and lisitsyn will switch time ball throwing machine to "forward" again
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: pretty good
 lisitsyn	I started to understand gps myself hahah
@wiking	HeikoS: i'm already married :))))
