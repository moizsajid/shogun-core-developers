 sanuj	HeikoS: i was wondering if we can use nvidia's modergpu2 for cuda backend in linalg
 sanuj	HeikoS: https://github.com/nvlabs/moderngpu
@HeikoS	sanuj: maybe at some point
@HeikoS	sanuj: I would already be happy if we had a simple GPU speedup somewhere
@HeikoS	that is some algorithm that runs faster if a GPU is present
@HeikoS	that is the first step
@HeikoS	and then shogun wide is second step
@HeikoS	then we can think about tweaking backends
 sanuj	i see

@wiking	sanuj: why viennacl is not good enough?
 sanuj	wiking: viennacl is fine, lambday was talking about a separate CUDA backend in future
@wiking	i mean it has cuda backend support
@wiking	why would that make any sense
@wiking	i mean in the first place we've started to use viennacl
@wiking	because of the fact
@wiking	that it should seemlessly wrap the gpu backend
 sanuj	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3100
 sanuj	wiking: i dunno much about viennacl so i can't comment
@wiking	ok so why do we start adding more shit
@wiking	if we dont know what is the initial thing?
@wiking	i mean lets stop doing this 'add everything that is YOLO'
@wiking	and then things will be better attitude
 lisitsyn	YOLO
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	fucking yolo solutions

 c4goldsw	Hey, is anyone around right now?
 c4goldsw	I need some guidance on fixing a build error I'm receiving.
 shogun-buildbot	build #139 of deb1 - libshogun - PR is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun%20-%20PR/builds/139
 c4goldsw	Specifically, I had four modular builds fail due to some code I refactored (an example: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/118924063 ) - it would appears is if they all failed as I had moved CStatistics::variance into linalg::variance.  The error causing these builds to fail is "undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun11CStatistics8varianceENS_8S
 c4goldsw	GVectorIdEE".  I've replaced all usages to CStatistics::variance, so I'm not sure what the problem is.  Does anyone have any insights?

 OXPHOS	Hello somebody! May I ask what IDE/editor do you recommend for Mac?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: no mac user here :)
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I guess you will get VIM as reply ;)
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: Have a moment?
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: yes, shoot :)
 c4goldsw	Great.  I saw your message on my PR, I'm breaking things up.

 c4goldsw	Still, I have build erros I don't understand. I had four modular builds fail due to some code I refactored (an example: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/118924063 ) - it would appears is if they all failed as I had moved CStatistics::variance into linalg::variance.  The error causing these builds to fail is "undefined symbol: _ZN6sh

 c4goldsw	(copy pasted sorry)
@HeikoS	lambday: btw do we have not unit tests for mmd stuff?
@lambday	HeikoS: not yet..
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: I cant really help with this little information
 c4goldsw	Not even with looking at the build report?
@HeikoS	I guess the best is to isolate things more
 c4goldsw	Alright, I'll try that then.
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: this is caused if a method is only in header I think
@HeikoS	linalg is not always available on travis
@HeikoS	you have to guard things
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: seriously..I am too noob I guess XD. I just want to find something that gives me tab when I hit tab. Other than VIM. I'll try some others. Thanks!
 c4goldsw	Ah, ok, with #IFDEF ?

@HeikoS	c4goldsw: yes
 c4goldsw	I'll get onto it yet.
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: Thanks.
 c4goldsw	OXPHOS: Eclipse works rather nicely if you ask me, with the CDT plug in (not to mention that you can also build CDT4 project files for Shogun :) )

@lambday	HeikoS: what are those?
@HeikoS	lambday: I made a noteobook ... just re-running and sharing
@HeikoS	lambday: permutation I guess
@HeikoS	statistical bug, not sure where it comes from in the code
@lambday	HeikoS: okay.. must be quadratic-time mmd?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lambday: but we can do the same checks with the others
@HeikoS	lambday: somehow these tests should be translated into unit tests actually ... but can do that later
@HeikoS	random unit tests are always annoying
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. I'll add unit tests for these tests as well as the internal components.. I have quite a lot of them covered in flash.. gotta make those gtests
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: not sure if these "makes statistical sense" tests should be in unit
@lambday	HeikoS: hehe I don't think they should be.. I'll have to take care of that via examples/notebook maybe
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah .... mmmh ok
@HeikoS	notebooks are one option
@HeikoS	but it kind of obscures them if all statistical tests are tested for their calibration
@HeikoS	lambday: it is a test, but not unit, more like functionality or so

@HeikoS	sanuj: nice one :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: did you have any further look at lisitsyn plugin stuff?
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	i talked to besser82
 sanuj	he told me to implement tags and string based parameters and check if it works with SWIG
 sanuj	so i'll start working on that
 sanuj	since besser82 is working on dynaplugz
@HeikoS	sanuj: ah yes a prototype for swig would be good
@HeikoS	good idea
@HeikoS	lambday: https://gist.github.com/52b1a14114d00eb545ab527961766465
@HeikoS	lambday: have a minute to talk about this?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah let me check
@lambday	checking your comments
@HeikoS	lambday: check the last two cells
@HeikoS	last one first
@HeikoS	there I have the case where H0 is true, check how I generate data
 lisitsyn	yes please!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: pleaseplease
@HeikoS	lambday: so if H0 is true, then whenever I compute the statistic, it is distributed according to null
@HeikoS	lambday: if I permute, this doesnt change anything
 sanuj	HeikoS: besser82 told me to wait till the loading and plugin interface-part is finished in dynaplugz
 sanuj	then i can add tags and string parameters to that
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok then
@lambday	HeikoS: checking.. let me check whether we have to set simulate_null=true here
@HeikoS	sanuj: any ETA?
@HeikoS	lambday: no wait, doesnt matter
@HeikoS	permuting or not doesnt change things
@HeikoS	as p and q have the same distribution already
@lambday	yeah
@HeikoS	so I coimpute type1 error here
 sanuj	HeikoS: i don't know how much time will it take to complete
@HeikoS	that is: rejected even though H0 is true
 sanuj	i'll start from tonight
@HeikoS	which should happen exactly alpha times
@HeikoS	alpha=0.05 here
@HeikoS	this is just from the way the threshold is constructed: the 1-alpha quantile of the null
@HeikoS	so by construction, the statistic should lie above that threshold only 5% of the time
@HeikoS	but the rejection rate is way higher
@HeikoS	this case is the most simple one
@lambday	yeah I see
@HeikoS	lambday: If you want, I can use mmd.compute_statistic to show you what I mean
@HeikoS	lambday: this is even true if there is a bug in compute_statistic
@HeikoS	any random statistic has to full fill this if the permutation works correctly
@HeikoS	lambday: ok this is problem 1
@HeikoS	lambday: problem2 is related I think
@HeikoS	lambday: if H0 is true, then the distribution of p-values is uniform by construction
@HeikoS	lambday: in the second last cell, I compute p-values many times, and they are not uniform
@HeikoS	similar to the other case, this is independent of the statistic. *any* random statistic with permutation test has to satisfy this
@HeikoS	same thinking
@HeikoS	whether you permute or not, the statistic is computed the same way
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah true.. trying to figure out where the bug might be
@HeikoS	lambday: the other comments are more related to performance

@lambday	HeikoS: rejections[i] = mmd.perform_test(), this should be rejections[i] = mmd.perform_test(alpha) I think
@HeikoS	here is a cell that computes p-value by hand -- this should give the correct result ... just running it
@HeikoS	ouch right
@HeikoS	lambday: that might have been it for the last one :)
@HeikoS	lambday: ah man, that is why this thing has to be removed -- kind of type error: returning p-value or boolean...sorry if that was the problem
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe the others can be "fixed" that way too? :)
@lambday	HeikoS: dunno :( checking.. what about mmd.compute_p_value(0.05) ? compute_p_value takes the statistic, is 0.05 the alpha here?
@lambday	HeikoS: try this one.. just perform_test() for the 2nd last cell.. that will give the p-values
@HeikoS	yep trying
@lambday	HeikoS: this is happening due to lack of documentation.. sorry about that :(
@HeikoS	lambday: no definitely my fault
@HeikoS	but also reveals some interface issues I guess ;)
@lambday	yeah definitely
@HeikoS	ok re-running
@lambday	HeikoS: regarding performance, I'll have to optimize it for permutation test and make use of the precomputed kernel matrix.. I'll add that
@HeikoS	lambday: ah not yet precomputing it?
@lambday	HeikoS: no I did that only for stat-var computation.. not over multiple calls to compute_statistic...
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@lambday	nice that you pointed it out.. I'll add that support
@lambday	HeikoS: really curious about whether the results make sense now
@HeikoS	yes same
@HeikoS	*waiting*

@HeikoS	love the multicore!
@lambday	HeikoS: for quadratic time mmd, it's useless :D for streaming b-test/linear-time, we'll have to see whether it gives any boost
@HeikoS	lambday: for quadratic time the kernel matrix can be computed in parallel no?
@lambday	HeikoS: well, CKernel::kernel is anyway pthreaded.. maybe for kernel selection it may make some difference
@HeikoS	yes, thats why I asked whether you precompute the kernel matrix?
@HeikoS	lambday: ok p-values are uniform now
@HeikoS	phew
@HeikoS	lambday: when you do the permutation test, and kernel  matrix is precomputed
 sanuj	lambday: viennacl 1.7.1 works with shogun right?
@HeikoS	this just corresponds to summing things in a different way right?
@HeikoS	no additional matrix is computed or stored?
@HeikoS	lambday: type1 error now also is fine!
@HeikoS	good

@HeikoS	lambday: so how can I help best with things?
@HeikoS	lambday: btw one thing
@lambday	HeikoS: you're already helping a lot man.. checking the sanity of the framework and suggesting api changes :)
@HeikoS	lambday: let's try to fix the travis build for the bigtest branch
@HeikoS	so that I can add examples for everything we want to be possible
@HeikoS	and then we can check against that on the fly
@lambday	HeikoS: alright.. yeah that can be fixed if we #ifdef cxx11 the whole thing :D
@HeikoS	lambday: do it then :)
@lambday	alrighty
@lambday	HeikoS: I'll do some clean-up for bigtest today (if Bangalore state electricity board allows me, that is)..
@lambday	HeikoS: BTW sending a PR for cdflib.. have a look

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
 lisitsyn	hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: all good?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: there is a problem with the meta snippet parser
 lisitsyn	sphinx one?
@HeikoS	somehow, the thing gets confused when the tag of the snippet appears in the code
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: know where you did the check?
 lisitsyn	got example?
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/b6746cf5a5dff068438b5fc33d493964
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: add this and then run make meta examples
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: check generated cpp
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: got syntax error
 lisitsyn	is that it?
@HeikoS	doesnt compile
@HeikoS	the cpp listing is incomplete
 lisitsyn	what's different?
 lisitsyn	it looks valid
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it didn't generate the thing

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: removed compilation errors, added libcdf
@HeikoS	ah yes
@HeikoS	damn didnt see that
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but what's wrong?
@HeikoS	dont know
 lisitsyn	I am not sure I see that
 lisitsyn	looks ok
@HeikoS	its the enum
 lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok another problem
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: enums and ctags
@HeikoS	if the enum is not defined in the same header file as the class, it is not included
 lisitsyn	ctags? how are they being used?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe I better check things properly before I ask
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: did I miss something?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw we have almost finished removing gpl codes from statistics
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: seen some commits
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: nope, just give me some time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you know whether we have any other gpl codes?
 lisitsyn	uh
 lisitsyn	probably
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: covertree
 lisitsyn	lets drop it is buggy anyway
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can you do that in a feature branch?
@HeikoS	couldnt agree more if it is buggy
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am a bit overwhelmed with Q1 coming to the end
 lisitsyn	can do later this week
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@HeikoS	ok would be great to get this bsd release done before gsoc starts
@HeikoS	since then we can use the c++11
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: got it
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
@HeikoS	wiking: heheh ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: we have a fast random backend
@wiking	should we actually use that
 lisitsyn	yeahaa
@wiking	to generate various distribs?
 lisitsyn	t-sne is bsd-4
 lisitsyn	!
 lisitsyn	I thought it was gpl
@wiking	HeikoS: i mean it's a unified PRNG
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you mean?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah up for using it
@wiking	it has a normal/gaussian generator
@wiking	*CRandom
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: SLEP is GPL
@wiking	this is in response to the whole libcdf story
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I see, but the point of cdflib is different
 lisitsyn	oh
@HeikoS	wiking: we need the cdf functions
@HeikoS	these are integrals
 lisitsyn	I'd have to drop my whole GSoC project :D
@wiking	mm yeah
@HeikoS	not random numbers
@HeikoS	wiking: these are computed from low level stat functions, gamma etc, many of them not in closed form but have to to power/series expansions
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	but since it follows a pdf
@wiking	right?
@HeikoS	wiking: cdflib is good since it is the exact same code as I would put in myself, but it is already used for 30 years
@wiking	i mean a random variable
@HeikoS	wiking: no randomness
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any thoughts about SLEP`
@HeikoS	?
@wiking	but i mean you use a distro for that no?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hard thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we can maybe have a -DDROP_NON_BSD_CODE
 lisitsyn	well I don't mind dropping it
@wiking	otherwise the cdf would make no sense
 lisitsyn	miserable chances someone to use it
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont get what you mean
@wiking	btw whats the deal with svmlight
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	it is non-free, right?
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	what's that license is like?
@HeikoS	non gpl even
@wiking	i mean i know we cannot have it gpl
 lisitsyn	no license
@wiking	but why's that
@HeikoS	the guy doesnt want to
@HeikoS	sonney2k: asked him
@wiking	nono what i mean is
@wiking	what is the licensing issue there
@wiking	is it because they want it opensource
 lisitsyn	he like begged him as far as I know
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	no free license still
@wiking	but they want to keep it to themselves?
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	so you can use the code but then again anything than academic
 lisitsyn	I don't get the point
@wiking	you shoulndt use
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	yes probably that
@wiking	because they could come after you and take all your bases?
 lisitsyn	raise NoCommentsException()
@wiking	sift (a img feature transform) is similar
@wiking	free academics
@wiking	$$ otherwise
 lisitsyn	thankfully deep learning is not taken yet
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	i guess we'll have then a nonBSD flag
@wiking	anyways
@wiking	(that would cover for sure svmlight)
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	so if we are tehre
@wiking	we can add some other stuff there
@wiking	and that's it
 lisitsyn	then I don't have to drop my old code
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	just flag it nonbsd
@wiking	and done
@HeikoS	wiking: +1
@HeikoS	so all we need to do is to put a guard for those right?
@wiking	basically
@wiking	just transform
@wiking	the GPLv3 or SVMLIGHT flag
@wiking	to nonbsd flag
@wiking	and add anything that cannot be bsd-ed
@wiking	USE_SVMLIGHT
@wiking	that should be
@wiking	NON_BSD or something
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, I can start a branch with that
@HeikoS	wiking: will do once the cdflib stuff is in
@HeikoS	wiking: since I already started, and its good to remove this alglib sh*** anyways
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking made you rude
@wiking	;D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: in this case, that word is very appropriate, no need for wiking to make me  use that :D
 lisitsyn	is that so bad?
@wiking	i think we are just following the footsteps of Linus Torvalds
@wiking	:))))))))))))))))
 lisitsyn	mah this guy is not even from moscow
 lisitsyn	pfff
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	The fact is, people need to know what my position on things are. And I can't just say "please don't do that", because people won't listen. I say "On the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle," and I mean it
@wiking	:)
@wiking	    Because if you want me to "act professional," I can tell you that I'm not interested. I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The same way I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm *also* not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords. Because THAT is what "acting professionally" results in: people resort
@HeikoS	hahahahaha
@wiking	 to all kinds of really nasty things because they are forced to act out their normal urges in unnatural ways.
@wiking	and that's all i can say
@wiking	;)
@wiking	(c) Linus Torvalds
@HeikoS	hahaha
@HeikoS	read the bio, its a funny read
@HeikoS	im gonna go to bed
@HeikoS	enjoy following linus! :)
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	well he has a point
@wiking	look at linux .... where it came from
@wiking	and what it became
@wiking	(same goes for git
