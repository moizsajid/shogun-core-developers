 sanuj	BZDMG, there?
 sanuj	I solved the bug
 sanuj	very silly bug
 arianepaola	ping wiking

 BZDMG	sanuj:
 BZDMG	so what's the bug
 sanuj	one word

 sanuj	should be void set(...)
 sanuj	i actually did all the changes step by step on a fresh branch to spot this

@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@wiking	OXPHOS: china!
@HeikoS	jojo
 OXPHOS	wiking: hello!
@wiking	BAZDMEG
@wiking	BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZDMEG
@wiking	OXPHOS sanuj Saurabh7__
@wiking	where is the weekly email? :)
@wiking	OXPHOS sanuj Saurabh7__ PING PING PING PING PING
@wiking	please let's try to have this in your calendars
@wiking	so i dont have to do this every week
@wiking	thnx
 OXPHOS	wiking: working on it. trying to locate the revised schedule i wrote yesterday..
@wiking	okok
@wiking	it's 5:28pm
@wiking	:P
@wiking	i know where u r
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	in fact, as I said in the last email, pls also send a 1-2 sentence short status every day you work on shogun
 sanuj	okay, sending
 sanuj	i was thinking of reporting what i had done today
 sanuj	since the day is not over, i didn't send
@HeikoS	the daily thing can me minor, totally fine
@HeikoS	just for us to keep track
 sanuj	sending to HeikoS BZDMG wiking and lambday
@wiking	no
@wiking	mailing list
 sanuj	shogun list
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	is a perfect place
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	sanuj: so what sup with da bug?
 sanuj	HeikoS, solved it
 sanuj	was silly
@HeikoS	sanuj: great!!
@HeikoS	sanuj: what was it?
 sanuj	HeikoS, i actually did all the changes step by step on a fresh branch to spot this as you had suggested ;)
 sanuj	HeikoS, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/commits/380f576e3615aea29b56f0afb721efe5485510ae#diff-9c3599c0d2090e493be261b079e9b63eR37
 sanuj	should have been void set(...)
 sanuj	forgot to do this ^
 OXPHOS	wiking: haha you caught me
@wiking	:>
@HeikoS	sanuj: this is the private method to add a nonexisting tag?
@HeikoS	sanuj: can you rename this to something better then _set?
 sanuj	no this is in Self struct in SGObject.cpp
 sanuj	HeikoS, i have renamed _set to add() to set a parameter for first time from init_param()
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool
@HeikoS	so then, you can re-add the things you had developed
@HeikoS	or did you already?
@HeikoS	sanuj: and then we can finally merge this pr
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'm just adding some unit-tests
 sanuj	on MockObject
@HeikoS	sanuj: great, pls ping me once done
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	I am online for 2 more hours or so
 sanuj	HeikoS, that's good
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so how are things going?
 sanuj	back in UK?
 sanuj	no it seems
 sanuj	HeikoS_web,
@HeikoS	sanuj: no thats my workstation in the office
@HeikoS	I am still hiding
 sanuj	yeah....that's how in inferred that you are not in london :P
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: good! revising based on your comments
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ok, as said, I am here for a while now
@HeikoS	so we can discuss also, if needed
@HeikoS	wiking: when do you finally tell us how to get rid of the templating macros?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: cool! I have a question -
 OXPHOS	template<class T>   void SGVector<T>::copy_data(const SGReferencedData &orig)   { gpu_vector=std::shared_ptr<GPUMemoryBase<T>>(((SGVector*)(&orig))->gpu_vector);
@HeikoS	shoot
 OXPHOS	you said: this crashes if I pass SGMatrix, no? If so, this was a bug. Could need a fix there
@HeikoS	yeah since you static cast
@HeikoS	and if I passed something else than SGVector what happens?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ever saw this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27504280/metaprogramming-with-stdis-same
 OXPHOS	like some other derived of SGRef?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: yes, like SGMatrix
@HeikoS	no type error
@HeikoS	but static cast will fail
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: yeah i see. But not sure how to avoid that..?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: can you give me the link again?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: is_same also requires a list of all types right? why is it different from the template<T> stuff?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3310/files#diff-9b962870c247ccd3f897b1ceacae8567
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: not sure, just was looking at it, never really checked it before
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so copy_data is not a method of SGReferencedData, right? Just of SGVector?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: it's pure virtual in SGRef
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I see
@HeikoS	ok then
 OXPHOS	But if we also have a gpu_data in SGMatrix maybe it is okay..?
@HeikoS	I kind of dont wanna put a dynamic cast
@HeikoS	so just leave it for now
@HeikoS	Ill ask BZDMG
 OXPHOS	sure HKS!
 BZDMG	what?
@HeikoS	BZDMG: copy_data method
@HeikoS	purely virtual in SGReferencedData

-!- mode/#shogun [+o lambday] by ChanServ
@HeikoS	implemented in SGVector
@HeikoS	BZDMG: doesnt check type
@HeikoS	but static casts to SGVector
@lambday	erm.. what are we talking about?
@HeikoS	lambday: minor stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: whats needed to merge OXPHOS PR?
@lambday	HeikoS: let me check
@lambday	well the build is broken.
@lambday	secondly, this still is for develop branch
 OXPHOS	Do I suppose to split them into .h and .cpp?
@lambday	OXPHOS: why didn't you just refactor things in the linalg_refactor branch? there you've already added the global instance
@lambday	OXPHOS: why do we need to keep adding the same thing in multiple branches? :)
 BZDMG	HeikoS: show me the code I don't get it :)
 OXPHOS	lambday: dunno..because some stuff are already merged?
 OXPHOS	lambday: I can pull it against that branch for this update
@lambday	OXPHOS: merged to the feature branch.. doesn't mean we can't change things later :)
 OXPHOS	lambday: haha sure. also why it always fails some tests?
@lambday	OXPHOS: you'll have to check that
@lambday	OXPHOS: but please make the PR against feature/linalg_refactor branch..
@lambday	where you already added those stuffs.. just refactor it
 OXPHOS	lambday: sure
 OXPHOS	BZDMG: i think you're @-ed on Github for that line of codes
@lambday	OXPHOS: also, I don't think you have turned off *all* the SGVector operations when data is on gpu.. we have to make sure that they throw error message instead of just crashing
 Saurabh7__	Hi
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: yo
 OXPHOS	lambday: not all..there're some static ones
@lambday	OXPHOS: but in case you did that already, just ignore my comments :D
 OXPHOS	lambday: those static methods..I think they should be moved out finally..and they takes T* not SGVectors actually so I think they're harmless for now
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: jojo
@lambday	OXPHOS: what are those methods?
 OXPHOS	lambday: sum..add..norm..
@lambday	OXPHOS: yeah they should be moved out! put to linalg
@lambday	OXPHOS: but let's not do it all in just one patch
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: I think I have updated most comments in the PR,
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: you feel it is merge ready?
@HeikoS	will check soon
 OXPHOS	lambday: sure
@lambday	OXPHOS: it's easier to miss things - we gotta do it in some later patch
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: yes
@lambday	BZDMG: who are your vowels?
 Saurabh7__	mm lemme check memleak
@lambday	ate*
@HeikoS	lambday: jo
@HeikoS	lambday: can you give me a little tip here
@lambday	HeikoS: sure.. what is it about?
@HeikoS	lambday:  see pm
@HeikoS	lambday: can you see?
@lambday	yes
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: got some timings on which changes helped?
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: yes will have to put them in
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3293/files#diff-8faba8d51b4c212ec2cf40d103697caaR571
@HeikoS	what about this?
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: ah yes, a column is chosen there to go through
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: so do we need num_subset of columns
 Saurabh7__	* we need
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: so you recommend sorting the first num_subset elements ?
@HeikoS	everything that determines the order in which you access memory
@HeikoS	should be sorted
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: all my comments were minor
@HeikoS	Ill give me OK to merge
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: ok thanks, will get those values out and do memcheck here
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: once thats done, then we do get rid of the float64_t?
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: yes could be

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: jo
@HeikoS	could you clean up the doc?
@HeikoS	lots of deprecated stuff in there
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: maybe just create a new doc with the revised timeline
@HeikoS	not sure where to look
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: which one?
@HeikoS	the doc you sent in the mail to list
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: oh i see. so I'll remove the outdated ones
@HeikoS	OXPHOS, Saurabh7__, gotta leave soon
@HeikoS	might be back later
@HeikoS	but anything you want to discuss?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: not yet. thx!
@HeikoS	cool see you later then

 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: next I will try multithreaded thing and removing float64_t ?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: start with float64
@HeikoS	there might be some mini issues we need to solve with this
@HeikoS	or multithread
@HeikoS	you can choose :)

 sanuj	BZDMG, there?
 BZDMG	sanuj: a bit
 sanuj	BZDMG, need to discuss one thing
 BZDMG	yeap
 sanuj	BZDMG, now params are set in init_params() for each class
 sanuj	they are declared but not initialized with a value
 sanuj	BZDMG, if someone does get() then it will result in garbage value
 sanuj	without setting a value to it
 sanuj	BZDMG, ?
 BZDMG	sanuj: get should fail
 BZDMG	if there is no such thing
 BZDMG	no garbage
 sanuj	BZDMG, currently we have this
 sanuj	    void init_params()
 sanuj	    {
 sanuj	        m_vector = SGVector<float64_t>();
 sanuj	        add("vector", m_vector);
 sanuj	        add("int", m_int);
 sanuj	        add("float", m_float);
 sanuj	    }
 sanuj	    SGVector<float64_t> m_vector;
 sanuj	    int32_t m_int;
 sanuj	    float64_t m_float;
 sanuj	BZDMG, how to make get() fail?
 sanuj	BZDMG, and we need to consider member variables with default values also....
 BZDMG	BZDMG: get = if has(..) return else fail
 BZDMG	sanuj: ^
 BZDMG	not really get the problem
 sanuj	BZDMG, there are two functions now in SGObject.h
 sanuj	set() and add()
 BZDMG	yes
 sanuj	add is protected and set is public
 sanuj	add("vector", m_vector); will do => map[basetag] = any
 sanuj	but m_vector is empty
 sanuj	same is the case for m_int, m_float
 sanuj	so m_int and m_float have random values since they are not initialized
 sanuj	BZDMG, has() will also return true since they exist in the map
 sanuj	BZDMG, got it?
 BZDMG	sanuj: probably yes
 BZDMG	but it is not garbage
 BZDMG	its default
 BZDMG	I think we should explicitly provide what value to put
 sanuj	BZDMG, most members dont have default value
 sanuj	okay
 BZDMG	they all have
 BZDMG	it is either zero or something like that
 sanuj	BZDMG, no worries then
