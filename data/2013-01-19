@sonney2k	heiko2, you should twitter again :) about that perl interface from last year or did you already?
 heiko2	sonney2k, yeah, should do that :)
 heiko2	is it done yet?
@sonney2k	heiko2, I don't think so but I think we screwed up badly
@sonney2k	we should have announced it back then
@sonney2k	at least I don't see the dev in the channel any longer...
 heiko2	mmmh
 heiko2	so twittering about it now won't help will it?
 heiko2	sergey's new library is worth being shout out
@sonney2k	heiko2, it will at least make people aware that there is some perl interface WIP
@sonney2k	heiko2, sergey writes a jmlr paper about it so it certainly will get enough publicity
 heiko2	cool
 heiko2	ok then I will do a twitter, "Interested in accessing #shogun-toolbox via perl? Join the current efforts of creating a new modular interface <link>"
 heiko2	sonney2k, btw we also got a link to shogun on kernel-mmd project site now, so hopefully people will come over from that
@sonney2k	heiko2, I think it is partly working already
@sonney2k	but yes anything is better than nothing
* sonney2k wonders why he is so sleepy - hibernate mode?
 heiko2	sonney2k, it is winter and already dark, isnt that enough? :)
 heiko2	whats the link of the repository?
 heiko2	for the perl?
 blackburn	o! people talk here!
@sonney2k	heiko2, it is merged already!
 heiko2	oh wow, sonney2k, didn't know that
@sonney2k	and can be enabled with --interfaces=perl_modular
 heiko2	any examples?
@sonney2k	heiko2, recall that adding new $LANG is just creating typemaps
 heiko2	I know
 heiko2	but I thought that this stuff was not yet merged
 heiko2	being a bit outdated ... many things currently happen
 blackburn	heiko2: http://lisitsyn.github.com/tapkee check dis out
 heiko2	very cool blackburn!
 heiko2	sonney2k, will twittter soon, some guests arrived gotta go, byebye :)
