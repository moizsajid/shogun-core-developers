@sonney2k	blackburn, I use a full screen console + vim for shogun
@sonney2k	ahh and a webbrowser for github
 blackburn	nothing more?
@sonney2k	sure chat stuff
@sonney2k	mail
@sonney2k	image + movie playing
 blackburn	do you use gnome?
@sonney2k	y
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	well you kinda old-school with using vim for shogun :)
 blackburn	I don't know how to use it at all
@sonney2k	the weird things is though that I started with full fledged IDE's like Visual Studio ...
@sonney2k	I am just 10 times more efficient typing with vim
* sonney2k thinks one should introduce a vim edit distance
 blackburn	why not emacs?
@sonney2k	emacs is big slow and you need 10 fingers
@sonney2k	no way to type efficiently there
@sonney2k	blackburn, I suggest to run vimtutor once to understand what I mean
 blackburn	what is vimtutor?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I guess I understand
@sonney2k	a program
@sonney2k	that gives you a short vim tutorial
 blackburn	I see I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you use vim for latex too?
@sonney2k	after running it I was convinced
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	I prefer texworks
@sonney2k	even on the shell
@sonney2k	blackburn, let me guess an IDE?
 blackburn	not so, just editor on the left and results (pdf) on the right :)
@sonney2k	there are lots of plugins for vim but I am not a big user of those
 blackburn	hmm so you just edit .text
 blackburn	.tex
 blackburn	and then compile it
 blackburn	and then view
@sonney2k	I use things like pressing a key on top of a word and seeing the manpage for it
@sonney2k	or opening the file under the cursor
@sonney2k	splitting horizontally/vertically
@sonney2k	and jumping around in history
@sonney2k	ahh and compiling of course
@sonney2k	and being put to the line that contains the error
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw could you please compile java_modular once
@sonney2k	(from master)
 blackburn	np, but in a 10-15 minute
 blackburn	minutes*
 blackburn	because I just reinstalled ubuntu and don't have many things
 blackburn	may be even java :)
@bettyboo	grin
 blackburn	damn my internet connection is slow for some unknown reason
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's up with java_modular?
@sonney2k	ohh
@sonney2k	not clear what happened
@sonney2k	I thought my machine rename was really only that
@sonney2k	but apparently I also included Labels in the classifier
@sonney2k	and that seems to confuse java (but makes python happier...)
 blackburn	seems I will be able to test it only next day :)
 blackburn	100kbps is not really sufficient to install all the things I need now
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	I guess I will go to sleep then
@sonney2k	thx for the summary email btw.
 blackburn	sleep well

 serialhex	blackburn, you're running debian now?
 blackburn	serialhex: yap
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	and cementing toy aircraft hhe
 blackburn	damn I have to work *hard* tomorrow
 serialhex	you build model aircraft?  what are you building??
 serialhex	and what *hard work* are you doing tomorrow?
 blackburn	enola gay
 blackburn	well prepare for exams and LMDS :)
 serialhex	ahh, cool cool
* serialhex just googled enola gay
 serialhex	you know, it's *stupid* easy to build one of the 2 bombs they dropped on japan (well, easy if you have enriched uranium)
 blackburn	why bomb? aircraft :)
 serialhex	well, i'm just saying.  enola gay dropped little boy, and it was either that one or fat man that can actually be built pretty simply
 blackburn	I see
 serialhex	anyway, what editor do u use for coding?
 blackburn	serialhex: I use eclipse for C++, netbeans for java and geany for python :)
 serialhex	wtf?!?!?  why???
 blackburn	why what?
 serialhex	do you use 3 different editors??  i'm switching over to nano myself (from kate) but i couldnt see myself using 3 editors, ever!
 blackburn	why not?
 blackburn	I really like how netbeans works with java, but not for C++
 blackburn	and so on
 serialhex	well, for the most part, i find myself editing files in different langs often, so like in your case, if you were to edit come C, Java & Python at the same time you'd have 3 different editors open
 serialhex	hmm... i guess i can kind of understand that
 blackburn	but I can't mind this situation
 blackburn	java+C+python same time :)
 serialhex	for example, you're looking at some C code, or java and translating it to python or something
 serialhex	maybe trying to get the 2 langs to play nicely together?
 serialhex	for myself i'm sometimes switching between projects frequently enough that having 2 or 3 editors open at the same time would be a waste
 blackburn	I'm thinking about some old-school thing like doing everything in vim and sth like that
 blackburn	just like sonney2k doing :)
 serialhex	i'm making a repository of nano syntax highlighting files, if you wanna check that out
 serialhex	i'm writing up the readme & attribution stuff now
 serialhex	nano isnt as sporty as vi, but it's quick & easy!
 serialhex	*insert a 'your mom' joke here*
 blackburn	hehe
@bettyboo	:)
 serialhex	hey bettyboo, where have you been all my life?
@bettyboo	serialhex: my ruby doesn't work with your change, so we'll have to find a medium somewhere in between, it gives me a '/usr/bin/ld cant find -lruby1.8' error (i'm trying different configs & stuff and lost the exact msg, but i'll post it when i try that again)
 blackburn	now I'm installing texlive so I can't do anything
 blackburn	will cement another part
 serialhex	cool, ok
 blackburn	debian should be provided with some aircraft model
 blackburn	I have been installing it for a ~2 hours
 serialhex	holy crap!! 2 hours!!?!??!?!
 serialhex	it dosn't even take that long to install windoze!
 blackburn	my internet connections sucks today
 serialhex	:(
 serialhex	blackburn: https://github.com/serialhex/nano-highlight for spiffy nano-highlighting-goodness!!
 blackburn	will take a look
 serialhex	yeah, i stole like 99% of it all, but hey, if it helps people out then i'm all for it!
