@wiking	sonney2k: no not really as src could be anywhere
@wiking	coz of out of source compilation i cannot assume that .. is the root of shogun
@wiking	sonney2k: but i'll look into it how we can get around this
@sonney2k	wiking, but you have $ROOT/src right?
@wiking	i have src root yes
@wiking	${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} is the root of the source
@sonney2k	wiking, that would work then for the include
@wiking	but we do include that
@wiking	but i guess the order here metters
@sonney2k	wiking, yes first thing is taken first
@wiking	mmm
 shogun-buildbot	build #1770 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1770  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@iglesiasg	wiking, hey! I have an issue, I am not sure if it can be caused by some configuration in cmake, or something I am missing about it
@iglesiasg	wiking, I compile python modular and when I try to import the LMNN class with  from shogun.Metric import LMNN python crashes
@iglesiasg	import shogun.Metric works fine
@iglesiasg	other imports are fine too, e.g. from shogun.Classifier import KNN
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, backtrace / valgrind!

@wiking	thoralf: cannot do anything about that

@wiking	or
 sonne|work	wiking: well we could for sure - just add an option to specify the path to google mock/test

 lisitsyn	we can add a submodule

@wiking	lisitsyn: svn submodule? :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: well we can set up some git stuff for that
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	as said earlier happy to see patches
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: excellent idea!
@wiking	as well we need a mirror for eigen
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: much better than pulling external stuff all the time with svn and from other sources
 sonne|work	wiking: no we could just have a shogun-external git submodule
 sonne|work	that could contain all the external dependencies
@wiking	sonne|work: i'm good with that as well
 sonne|work	that then cmake could use (git pull ...)
@wiking	just need the solution today
 thoralf	Yeah, perfect to control versions of dependencies.
 sonne|work	thoralf: yes exactly
@wiking	thoralf: it's already controlled this way
 thoralf	wiking: No exactly - since it updates automatically, it could break on upstream updates, right?
 thoralf	upstream as-in google test updates.
@wiking	thoralf: no
@wiking	thoralf: because it's fixed to a revision
 thoralf	wiking: I see.
@wiking	i doesn't just fetches HEAD
@wiking	sonne|work: did we run integration tests on deb3 - modular_interfaces
@wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes sure
@wiking	ok
 sonne|work	wiking: how difficult is it to do a git clone shogun-external and then use the extracted sources (or .tar.gz) in there if a dependency could not be found?
 sonne|work	wiking: with cmake I mean

@wiking	sonne|work: why would we do that?
@wiking	sonne|work: i mean if it's a submodule then we should just assume that there are the sources
@wiking	or tar.gz/bz2 and that's it
 sonne|work	wiking: because we normally want to use the system's libs
@wiking	sonne|work: yes my problem wasn't that
@wiking	sonne|work: it was about why would we want to do a git clone?
@wiking	sonne|work: if dependency is not met
@wiking	it should be there
 sonne|work	wiking: to fetch the dependencies
 thoralf	wiking: I didn't find a place to add UPDATE_COMMAND.
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh you mean you would manually require people to issue git submodule update shogun-external ?
@wiking	sonne|work: and why not do that with git submodule init/update
@wiking	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	sure also possible
@wiking	thoralf: nevermind... just testing
@wiking	ok this works it seem
@wiking	*seems
@wiking	so i have a solution for not always updating svn
@wiking	just the one time checkout
@wiking	can we live with that?

 thoralf	sonne|work, wiking: I think CRandom is not thread safe.
 thoralf	We have one global instance of CRandom, but different threads may be using it.
@wiking	sonne|work: it is
@wiking	thoralf: sorry it is
@wiking	thoralf: but then again i might overlooked something so plz show me where does it go wrong
 thoralf	wiking: Okay, do we agree that there is only one global instance of CRandom and that - if using them from threads - all threads are accessing the same instance?
@wiking	thoralf: maybe adding an openmp based unittest for CRandom would be a good idea... i'll be waiting for the PR
@wiking	thoralf: yes
 sonne|work	thoralf: yes that function is *not* intended to be thread safe. if you want thread safe stuff use a Random object
 sonne|work	per thread
 thoralf	sonne|work: Okay, thank you.
 thoralf	sonne|work: I'm learning different machines in parallel using threads - and each thread uses stratifiedcrossvalidation, which uses the global crandom state.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Do you see how to avoid this?
 sonne|work	thoralf: only way would be to change stratifiedcrossvalidation to take a CRandom object as input
 thoralf	I'm getting strange errors and I think I have tracked it down to "shogun::CRandom::random_32() const (Random.cpp:123)"
 thoralf	Okay, I'll try that.
 sonne|work	thoralf: maybe if that object is null take the default one from CMath or so
 thoralf	Won't be easy, because StratifiedCrossValidationSplitting.cpp uses current->shuffle(), so I have to pass RNG states around.
 thoralf	CDynamicArray::shuffle calls CDynArray::shuffle calls CMath::random calls sg_rand->random()
 thoralf	Jesus. ;)
@wiking	thoralf sonne|work imho we should start deprecating CMath::random* stuff
@wiking	it's just an unecessary extra wrapper...
 thoralf	wiking: How does it solve the problem?
@wiking	thoralf: your's it doesn't solve
@wiking	thoralf: i've just remembered now when u wrote this...
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, it's quite nested.
 sonne|work	wiking: it is convenient though to just generate random numbers without having to create an object
@wiking	thoralf: u can make the CRandom thread safe quite easily.... as there's already a mutex in that class
 sonne|work	wiking: like java's Random and Math.random
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah sg_rand is there
 sonne|work	one has lots of features the other is just the simple thing
@wiking	sonne|work: no need to create an object as it's there as global...
 thoralf	wiking: But doesn't a mutex syncronize my threads and will kill parallelism?
@wiking	thoralf: well it's just locks until it gives u back the random...
@wiking	thoralf: i mean there's simply no other means to assure thread safetiness
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, but I'm needing loooots of random numbers.
@wiking	thoralf: but the locks will be quite short -> it's not going to be unparallelized ;)
 thoralf	There is: One state for each thread.
@wiking	thoralf: in that case as sonne|work said you are better of with a CRandom for each thread
@wiking	sonne|work: do we have a common way in shogun to mark deprecation?
 sonne|work	wiking: no but I don't think we should deprecate CMath::random
@wiking	i see SGIO.h
@wiking	sonne|work: why?
 thoralf	Yes, that's what I've been thinking.  But I needed to make sure that I'm not completly wrong. :)
 thoralf	wiking
 sonne|work	wiking: because it is easy to generate a random number with that w/o creating an object

@wiking	ok at least this function should be deprecated or changed: CMath::normal_random
 sonne|work	wiking: yes sure that would work too but I prefer CMath::random
@wiking	as there's a faster implementation of it in CRandom
 sonne|work	wiking: better drop it
 sonne|work	wiking: do we have a test for that (I mean that this is really gaussian?)
@wiking	sonne|work: for CMath::random no
@wiking	i mean for CMath::normal_random no
 sonne|work	IIRC I wrote sth fro uniform
 sonne|work	dont' remember for gaussian
@wiking	for CRandom::normal_distrib yes

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, we will use it as a submodule from the main project, right?

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes we will create an external dir and add it as submodule
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am not sure if I like better cmake taking care of that
@iglesiasg	the con I see with it is that AFAIK submodules have to be added by hand

@wiking	sonney2k: i dislike this idea

@wiking	sonney2k: namely everything is once fetched to unders <shogun root>/third_parties
@wiking	it is essentially the same thing as having another git repo

@wiking	that people forget to init submodules
@wiking	as they usually do (see the emails about not having data for the examples...)
@wiking	it is not impossible it has been fixed...
@iglesiasg	wiking, that was exactly the idea why I don't like to add submodules even to compile

@wiking	as currently the GoogleMock src is populated under the build dir
@wiking	so if you rm -rf * the build

@iglesiasg	I know it is easy to do git submodule update :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no nothing manual in there
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if some dependency is missign we just fetch them from inside cmake
@sonney2k	but you don't have to have subversion installed to do so

@wiking	let along a distrib builder
@wiking	who builds packages for distribs
@sonney2k	wiking, well we need a way to do offline builds like we had
@sonney2k	van51, I am currently not sure how the SGReferencedData code was doing it before
@sonney2k	van51, IIRC we had a pointer to a *single* refcount object for a vector (and its clones)
@wiking	sonney2k: the thing i've just described in the email does allow u that
@wiking	sonney2k: essentially it is down to one thing: you get the externals with git or svn
@wiking	and basically now this discussion became about what is better: git or svn
@sonney2k	van51, since a SGReferenced* object is only destroyed when refcount == 0 there can be just this single object left
@sonney2k	van51, and so this one can safely delete the ptr when count == 0 is reached and the vector data
@wiking	sonney2k: sorry: git vs svn+wget

 van51	sonney2k: yeah that's what I had changed, but I reverted it in the latest PR
@wiking	sonney2k: that is being assured by a rev... we do have to write for each external project (regardless of where the src coming from) a custom .cmake
@wiking	that we cannot avoid
 van51	sonney2k: but should copied SGObjects keep a single refcount object as well?
@wiking	sonney2k: if we take the submodule way to bump up a version of a given package: 1) we have to update the git submodule 2) we have to update the base shogun git repo. just like data update
@wiking	instead of one update on the main shogun repo

@sonney2k	van51, what is different with SGObject is that we only pass around pointers
@sonney2k	van51, so we only need to delete the last object and all is gone
@sonney2k	van51, I don't think the copy constructors really ever worked...
@sonney2k	wiking, well we don't *have to* use a submodule but I think it is a good idea to use it since this way we can ensure that a certain version of shogun requires certain set of third party deps
 van51	sonney2k: the way I have it in the copy constructor now of SGObject is that the new object will share the same ref counter with the original one
 van51	sonney2k: apart from that I believe that everything else has switched ok

 van51	sonney2k: also we have to decide how to unref
 van51	sonney2k: bc like you said there could be a race condition if we tested ref_count <= 0
 van51	sonney2k: and the way it is now, if you take a look at the unit test case, it requires an additional SG_REF
@sonney2k	van51, yes but I realized that this cannot be a problem because - when we do SG_UNREF more often then SG_REF it will crash anyways
@sonney2k	van51, so it is totally ok to check for ref_count <= 0
@sonney2k	and then delete this
@sonney2k	van51, same with SGReferencedData: if we have 2 threads assigning a=b  and a=c this is a race condition anyway, which should be solved at some other place
 van51	sonney2k: ok I get it
 van51	sonney2k: so I switch back to <=
 van51	sonney2k: also should I keep that test in the unit test file? it doesn't seem like it fits
@sonney2k	van51, sry which test?
@sonney2k	van51, so for SGObject also the same Refcount object right!
 van51	sonney2k: in the PR, i had added a unit test case to make sure it was working
@sonney2k	van51, which PR
