 serialhex	just fyi for anyone who cares: compiling shogun on a 1.2ghz celeron takes FOREVER!!!

 dave718	I'm trying to get RealFileFeatures to work and I'm having trouble constructing a compatible binary file.  I've been looking at the C code and trying to piece it together from that, but it would be immensely helpful if there were a working example file somewhere for me to use as a template.
 dave718	Also if anyone has any ballpark estimates for the memory requirements/speed hit I could expect switching from RealFeatures to RealFileFeatures, I'd really appreciate it.
