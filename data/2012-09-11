 chris_______	Don't know if anybody is currently active on here, but I'm trying to find a way to use SHOGUN with C++ on Windows and I want to know if it's a realistic option.  Haven't found a really solid answer elsewhere, yet.

 n4nd0	hi chris_______
 chris_______	hi n4nd0
 n4nd0	it should be possible, not easy though
 n4nd0	I am a linux guy so I cannot tell you exactly how to do it
 n4nd0	but I believe that you should use cygwin
 n4nd0	chris_______: do you have some experience with it?
 chris_______	I don't have much experience with cygwin, but I know that it generally gives the same command line capabilities as linux
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/faq.html
 n4nd0	chris_______: did you read that ^?
 chris_______	Thanks for the reference.  I'll try my best with that.  I'm generally a vanilla Windows/Visual Studio C++ guy, so hopefully the build process isn't too painful :)
 n4nd0	chris_______: anyway, let me ask you, why do you want to run shogun on windows?
 n4nd0	it is a requirement given by someone else or just personal choice?
 chris_______	the use of Windows + Visual Studio + C++ is a requirement
 n4nd0	aham, I see
 chris_______	Using SHOGUN is a personal choice.  Need a nice SVM library that supports multi-class classification and custom kernels
 n4nd0	good personal choice, to use shogun :)
 n4nd0	good luck with it then
 n4nd0	just ask around here if you think we may help you
 chris_______	Awesome, thanks so much for your help
 n4nd0	you are welcome
 chris_______	Hey, just one more question if that`s okay.  Once built with cygwin, do you know if all C++ programs using it must also be run from cygwin?  Or will it build object files that can be linked to a visual studio project, for example?  (I know you said you are a linux guy, so you might not know)

@sonney2k	chris_______, I think you should try to build it with devstudio directly and fix all issues that appear on-the-fly

 Domokoen	anybody present?
@sonney2k	Domokoen, ?
@sonney2k	no everyone is asleep
 Domokoen	ok
 Domokoen	I was wondering about Platts sigmoid fitting that has been added to Shogun: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/714
 Domokoen	because the parameters of the sigmoid are not stored nor available to read out in code
 Domokoen	they're only printed in a debug statement, SG_DEBUG("fitted sigmoid: a=%f, b=%f\n", a, b);
 Domokoen	but I'd prefer to store them, and then re-use them again in other label instances
@sonney2k	Domokoen, ugh - you should ask this question on the mailinglist - heiko (not around atm) is the other and will answer for sure
 Domokoen	I will then :)
