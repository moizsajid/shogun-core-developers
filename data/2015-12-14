@besser82	HeikoS, ping?
@HeikoS	besser82:  hi
@besser82	HeikoS, How is it going?
@besser82	HeikoS, What's going on @nips?
@HeikoS	besser82: its going well
@HeikoS	nips is over
@HeikoS	all people are gone
@HeikoS	I stayed :)
@besser82	HeikoS, I see...
@HeikoS	besser82:  and you?
@besser82	HeikoS, so you're still in canada?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	exploring
@besser82	HeikoS, currently on my way to Berlin
@besser82	have just been 10 Days at home
@besser82	between coming from the US back to Germany
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	what will you do in Berlin?
@HeikoS	where were you in the US?
@besser82	In the US I was at Jackie and her parents
@HeikoS	I see, nice
@besser82	In Berlin I'm gonna do some cat-sitting
@besser82	Jackie's cat  :P
@besser82	And possibly getting drunk with Thoralf and / or S?ren
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	you should do that
@HeikoS	s?ren went back yesterday
@HeikoS	but I think he is busy
@HeikoS	same as thoralf
@HeikoS	hey do you know of any nice csv library?
@HeikoS	for c++
@HeikoS	that could replace ours?
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2824
@besser82	So in the US I was near Flint-area, btw...
@besser82	Lemme dig-out some possible lib
@besser82	there are so many
@HeikoS	besser82: one that would be
@HeikoS	a) easy tointegral (either in debian or header only)
@HeikoS	b) actively maintained
@HeikoS	besser82: we want something easy to drop some code in Shogun ;)
@besser82	mhh...
@besser82	Name        : libcsv-devel
@besser82	Arch        : i686
@besser82	Epoch       : 0
@besser82	Version     : 3.0.3
@besser82	Release     : 4.fc23
@besser82	Gr?sse       : 18 k
@besser82	Paketquelle : fedora
@besser82	Zusammenfas : Small, simple and fast CSV library - development package
@besser82	URL         : http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/
@besser82	Lizenz      : LGPLv2+
@besser82	Beschreibun : libcsv is a small, simple and fast CSV library written in
@besser82	            : pure ANSI C89 that can read and write CSV data. It provides
@besser82	            : a straight-forward interface using callback functions to
@besser82	            : handle parsed fields and rows and can parse improperly
@besser82	            : formatted CSV files.
@besser82	HeikoS ^
@besser82	So libcsv is small and pretty light-wight
@besser82	weight
@besser82	~28 kbytes
@besser82	We could use that
@besser82	and is in debian, too:  https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libcsv
@besser82	and since it is pretty small:  we could bundle that for systems, that don't have it
@besser82	and from license-pov:  we can interface LGPL-code from BSD, without problems
@besser82	and without issues in licensing
@besser82	Code is ~ 330 kbytes
@HeikoS	jo
@HeikoS	great
@HeikoS	can you put that into the issue I sent and push for it? Then we have a higher chance of using it
@HeikoS	currently we can only read files <5mb or so
@HeikoS	besser82: jo do you know about the libarchive?=

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: HEIKO
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jojo
@HeikoS	how are things?
 lisitsyn	I AM BETWEEN THE NIGHT AND DAY
 lisitsyn	no idea what time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: be strict about going to bed
@HeikoS	only sleep at night
@HeikoS	not during the day
@HeikoS	that helps
 lisitsyn	already slept few hours
@HeikoS	not good
@HeikoS	try to take the pain
@HeikoS	and stay awake until it is night
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	otherwise you will have this for a week ;)
@HeikoS	if not just 1-2 days
 lisitsyn	ok so
 lisitsyn	release
 lisitsyn	I can get back to things
 lisitsyn	tomorrow
 lisitsyn	willl let you know on the progress
@HeikoS	good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: things are shaping up
@HeikoS	wu is fixing warnings
@HeikoS	news is done
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	csharp is being worked on
 lisitsyn	that's good
 lisitsyn	ok I am mindless now, but let me read about uk visas then ;)
@HeikoS	sure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hey I am doing a big patch
@HeikoS	dropping migration
@HeikoS	but it makes integration tests fail
 lisitsyn	yes that's too industrial
@HeikoS	I think I will de-activate them now
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	what do you think?
 lisitsyn	makes sense for me
@HeikoS	shall we take the risk and do it?
 lisitsyn	they are kind of broken anyway
 lisitsyn	no?
@HeikoS	there are many classes that are untested afterwards then
 lisitsyn	I do have some failure on these tests
@HeikoS	all of s?rens SVMs
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but I think we should do that
@HeikoS	otherwise we never move
 lisitsyn	yeah
@HeikoS	have to write unit tests eventually
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok I will do it then
 lisitsyn	integration tests are not that bad but we fail to maintain them
@HeikoS	or I can fix the few that I broke
@HeikoS	and we discuss
@HeikoS	again
@HeikoS	like for the last two years
@HeikoS	but I agree
@HeikoS	unmaintainable
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you have some motivation?
@HeikoS	to remove them from CMakeLists?
 lisitsyn	for?
@HeikoS	in my feature branch?
 lisitsyn	now?
@HeikoS	yes ;)
 lisitsyn	yeah may be
 lisitsyn	ok let me check
 lisitsyn	what branch?
@HeikoS	feature/remove_migration
@HeikoS	in my fork
@HeikoS	there is an open PR
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	ah your fork
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: shall I merge it?
@HeikoS	then you can edit
@HeikoS	I think for now just remove the integration part of the CmakeList
 lisitsyn	merge?
 lisitsyn	you should push it to the main repo
@HeikoS	so that examples are executed but no result checking
 lisitsyn	just the branch
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
@HeikoS	will do
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: done
