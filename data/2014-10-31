@wiking	mmm fuck we should generate snapshots for Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)
@wiking	is this released actually
@wiking	a yeah it seems
@iglesiasg	wiking: well, 14.04 is lts so it is cool to have it for it, methinks
@wiking	yeah but we should support latest as well
@wiking	i.e. 14.10
@iglesiasg	wiking: how much work is it to generate for different versions of the same os once one is ready?
@wiking	nah that's nothing
@iglesiasg	right
@wiking	i mean actually ubuntu is building it
@wiking	so it's really not much extra work
@wiking	but there needs to be some extra work
@wiking	about modular interface packaging
@iglesiasg	I see
@wiking	i mean i have 3 things on my plate
@wiking	modular packaging for ppa
@wiking	swig 3.x fix
@wiking	osx modular interface fix
@iglesiasg	those will be great to have, deffs
@wiking	btw we should create golang modular interface as well one day
@wiking	shouldn't be that hard
@iglesiasg	wiking: the osx issue is the one related to this float64_t or so not supported?
@wiking	iglesiasg: ah no that's really minor thing
@iglesiasg	wiking: I would like that a lot, yeah. It is actually supported by swig iirc
@wiking	the whole c# modular interface needs fixing
@wiking	as it was written for like .net 1.0
@iglesiasg	wiking: hard word during the summit: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11020840/fernando_sobado_sf.jpg
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/90/steps/csharp%20modular/logs/stdio
@wiking	this is the problem
@wiking	hahaha lol
@wiking	iglesiasg: btw have u realised that actualy now one can have shogun on windows

@iglesiasg	windows buuh
@wiking	well we need to support it in a way
@wiking	we miss a lot of users because of that
@iglesiasg	wiking: do you have any idea what can we do to minimise the number of times Travis fails?
@iglesiasg	it is just a lot
@wiking	iglesiasg: slice up modular :)
@iglesiasg	the normal thing is to find that at least one build broke. All green is rarely happening
 shogun-buildbot	build #913 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/913  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@wiking	it's all about not enough memory
@wiking	and .cxx itself is huge :<
@wiking	and of course it's just going to grow and grow
@iglesiasg	I am not sure anymore whether it is time or memory
@wiking	mem
@wiking	always the modular interface fails
@iglesiasg	I think I've seen lately the third gcc build in travis list fail a few times due to "Killed"
@wiking	have that's the coverage
@wiking	we can kill that
@wiking	but the modulars are always failing

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Remove OpenCV/Home.md since this information is in the home of the wiki.
@iglesiasg	wiking: is it useful to have the coverage in travis?
@wiking	well we can move it to buildbot
@iglesiasg	wiking: do we read the results from there normally or from buildbot?
@wiking	it's just integrated nicely this way
@iglesiasg	yeah, that's the thing
@wiking	with buildbot we'll have to do some hacking
@iglesiasg	we should make this huge project of modularising Shogun
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'm off
@iglesiasg	haha
@wiking	bll lunchtime
@wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	maybe in the hackaton if we get funding for it
@wiking	(and i told u that i have 3 tasks on my plate atm... so i'm not touching anything else)
@iglesiasg	I think I'll try to get a couple of hours of sleep before getting ready for the day
@iglesiasg	yeah sure, it was just a thought
@iglesiasg	not implying we have to make it *now*
@wiking	:P
@wiking	we should though :>
@wiking	anyhow i'm very hungry
@wiking	bbl
@iglesiasg	it probably requires some more design and thinking first
@iglesiasg	see ya, enjoy your meal

@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@HeikoS	wiking: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/99993-how-do-i-call-a-simple-hello-world-java-program-in-matlab
@HeikoS	wiking: what if we only support Matlab with java?
@HeikoS	wiking: more of a long term thing, but I am curious whether that would work
@wiking	there's now work by somebody on swig+matlab
@HeikoS	wiking: really?
@wiking	yeo
@HeikoS	wiking: I saw something a while ago, where did you find that?
@wiking	mailinlist
@wiking	of swig
@wiking	https://github.com/jaeandersson/swig/commits/matlab
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome
@HeikoS	wiking: I will write them and ask
@HeikoS	wiking: do you have facebook?
@wiking	yeah y?
@HeikoS	wiking: one of the guys has no public email, maybe you could forward my message to him?
@HeikoS	wiking: ill cc you
@HeikoS	wiking: I sent you a PM with his fb link and cced you in the email
@HeikoS	wiking: lets see
@wiking	kk
@wiking	cool
@wiking	can't we just ping him via github? :)
@wiking	HeikoS: how's ian btW?
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe, I dont know how to send messages over github
@HeikoS	wiking: how's?

@HeikoS	wiking: awesome thanks
@wiking	HeikoS: i've got your mail now, but who's ian to whom u sent the email? :D
@HeikoS	wiking: another dev in swig
@HeikoS	wiking: just looked who sent patches ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: just saw this guy
@HeikoS	Kris Thielemans
@HeikoS	wiking: is from london

@wiking	aaah ok
@wiking	well yeah but now we know joel's email so i guess we should directly contact him
@HeikoS	wiking: how did you get the log?
@HeikoS	I want to write him too
@HeikoS	wiking: I did
@wiking	as he is the actual developer of the matlab patch
@wiking	wel github
@HeikoS	wiking: and this kris guy too, maybe I can meet with him here
@wiking	well github... you know git requries you to set an author...
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah but how to get that over the webpage
@wiking	and you can ask for the raw patch/commit from github
@wiking	https://github.com/jaeandersson/swig/commit/a784b74a5d5172cf6986aed5f57f73472d1e0172

@wiking	https://github.com/jaeandersson/swig/commit/a784b74a5d5172cf6986aed5f57f73472d1e0172.patch
@wiking	i.e append .patch to the url
@wiking	and voila
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah found it
@HeikoS	cool did not know that :)
@wiking	HeikoS: check your PR emails from github
@wiking	you'll see there ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: matlab seems to work good
@HeikoS	they even have director classes
@HeikoS	and a test-suite
@wiking	btw i've foudn the bug with swig3.x
@wiking	i'm currently trying to figure out with swig people
@wiking	how to fix it
@wiking	but basically it's only for python
@HeikoS	wiking: ah great!
@wiking	i guess by monday we'll have a way
@wiking	i already have a way to fix it
@wiking	but maybe we are not using swig3.x in the right way
@wiking	that's why i want to doublecheck with swig ppl
@HeikoS	wiking: I see
@HeikoS	wiking: great!"
@HeikoS	wiking: I pushed bj?rn to fix the fedora
@HeikoS	wiking: then we still have swig3, ubuntu-binary, and some mini things
@wiking	fedora?
@HeikoS	wiking: build is broken
@wiking	ah that's normal
@wiking	it's FH
@HeikoS	wiking: and then I think we are in shape soon
@HeikoS	wiking: haha :D
@wiking	i mean it's like testing with debian sid
@wiking	sometimes its broken sometimes it's not
@wiking	but that's the life of unstable distro...
@HeikoS	wiking: I see, well it would still be good if thats green dont you think?
@wiking	no
@wiking	it's unrelated to shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: ok then
@HeikoS	wiking: even better
@wiking	it's an unstable branch of fedora
@HeikoS	wiking: I will then now start to do all the soft things we need for release: blog-post, release email, etc
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i still need to fix some stuff for
@wiking	osx
@HeikoS	wiking: I have to prepare a talk for Monday, so no time before that, and need to prepare teaching for Wed also, but the test of next week is free for me
@wiking	and there's still the question of whether or not we should get the debian packaging scrip into the repo
@HeikoS	so we could push it through by then maybe?
@wiking	i would say yes but would be great to have a chat about it with sonney2k
@HeikoS	wiking: ah good point
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont think thats feasible
@HeikoS	(talking to sonney2k)
@wiking	you mean talk? )
@wiking	:D
@wiking	he is superbusy?
@HeikoS	yeah, and unreliable to get things done in time
@HeikoS	so rather do it ourselves
@HeikoS	I guess you can decide in that case ;)
@wiking	hehe i see
@wiking	i'll see how i can proceed
@wiking	but anyhow there's still some things to be done
@wiking	to have all the stuff in ppa
@HeikoS	btw what do you think about a feature freeze after this release?
@HeikoS	like only clean-ups and fixes?
@wiking	yeah we need to do that
@HeikoS	for at least until next GSoC starts
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	we should rather do some architectural changes
@HeikoS	and compile a list of things for students to do in entrance period that are all fixes
@HeikoS	and no more crappy implemented ml algos
@HeikoS	yeah agree
@wiking	hehehe
@HeikoS	talked a lot with thoralf and fernando about this
@HeikoS	we made a huge list of ideas for re-structuring and clean ups
@HeikoS	will try to structure that soon
@wiking	put it up somewhere
@HeikoS	and then start step by step
@HeikoS	already did but not cleaned
@wiking	okok
@HeikoS	rest is in my head but will put that up soon
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Shogun-developer-meetings
@HeikoS	I put that in here
@HeikoS	(the first notes) more to follow
@HeikoS	wiking: and some other things here
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Project%20roadmaps
@HeikoS	its all in the wiki index
@HeikoS	wiking: btw try
@HeikoS	wiking: nm -gC libshogun.so |grep " T shogun::" |cut -d' ' -f3- |cut -d: -f3 |sort |
@HeikoS	uniq -c |sort -n |tail -n20
@wiking	yeah i saw that
@HeikoS	wiking: I will work on those things soon
@HeikoS	but yeah, for now release ;)
@HeikoS	or moreover, now I have to prepare my talk, hehe
@HeikoS	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Shogun-slim
@HeikoS	wiking: more to come, sounds quite extreme at first, but is not really when one thinks about it. Not loosing too much, but Ill put details later and start discussions
@HeikoS	wiking: man!
@HeikoS	wiking: I just saw the ppa
@HeikoS	amazing!
@HeikoS	wiking: I think you can safely remove colpack from the ppa
@HeikoS	its only one algorithm that is affacted
@HeikoS	affected
