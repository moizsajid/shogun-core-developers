 blackburn	sonney2k: here comes nice pic for the website https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/sonne.jpg
 blackburn	wiking: ^ :D
 gsomix_	blackburn, lol :3
 wiking	blackburn: lol man wtf is this? :)
 blackburn	wiking: secret http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/category/ photo
 gsomix_	good night guys

 blackburn	wiking: here it goes
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r0e9c608 / (11 files in 4 dirs): Introduced multiple output multiclass labels - http://git.io/x84IUg
 blackburn	hog is next on the list :)
 wiking	cool
 wiking	i'm just about to
 wiking	finish the unittester for SGVector
 wiking	and then i'll do a pr
 wiking	but not for actually merging
 wiking	but more for discussion
 wiking	hahahahah
 wiking	blackburn: i think i even found a bug
 wiking	while unit testing :)))
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	wiking: I just checked classes
 blackburn	hog won't work there for sure
 wiking	why?
 wiking	ok here goes my stupid example
 wiking	let the flame begin :DD
 wiking	there
 wiking	pr: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/667
 blackburn	wiking: well as I can see they are not centered or anything that would make hog work
 wiking	blackburn: can u merge this plz: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/659
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r532a5dd / (5 files in 3 dirs): Merge pull request #659 from vigsterkr/latent - http://git.io/VkPGqA
 CIA-18	shogun: Viktor Gal master * r5b8915d / (5 files in 3 dirs): Switch from function ptrs to CLatentModel - http://git.io/LUhFlg
 CIA-18	shogun: Viktor Gal master * r924dc20 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Fix spacing when casting - http://git.io/Kxx_7w
 wiking	thnx
 wiking	ok fuck i had trouble rebasing
 wiking	now it works
 wiking	thnx a lot
 wiking	blackburn: centered? in what sense?
 wiking	ok oh shit
 wiking	i should make your passwd work finally
 wiking	just a sed
 wiking	sec
 blackburn	I mean we don't know bounding window so HOG will just produce some noise
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: HOG of what do we want to compute?
 blackburn	I actually feel lost without any knowledge how to approach the problem :D
 droopy	:*)
 wiking	blackburn: we do a slidng window
 wiking	for hog
 wiking	droopy: HOG IT
 blackburn	wiking: how do you want to match it ?
 wiking	blackburn: well for starters
 wiking	we can do the same way as the guys
 wiking	in Large-scale Image Classification:
 wiking	Fast Feature Extraction and SVM Training
 wiking	see page 2 figure 2
 blackburn	they state liblinear didn't manage to converge after two weeks
 blackburn	omfg :D

 wiking	mmm what's tiiiis
 blackburn	my fault probably
 wiking	blackburn: aoh yeah i see

 rieck	morning.
 wiking	gsomix: http://mosh.mit.edu/
 gsomix	wiking, huh, ok. :)
 rieck	wiking: does it require a server and a client? or does it operate onto of ssh

 rieck	hmmm. needs extra udp port for communication. that's a downside
 rieck	also crypt of mosh's state protocol is not really audited
 rieck	still, very interesting
 wiking	rieck: well it'll use udp
 wiking	rieck: but yeah you need to install mosh on both server and client
 rieck	it's a good idea for sessions over wifi and mobile phones
 rieck	but for slow ssh forwarding sessions it will not really help
 wiking	rieck: well it uses udp, so that should be 'faster' a bit
 wiking	but yeah for me it's more the case when i'm switching between vpn-s
 wiking	or when my connection is bad
 rieck	yep but you need to tunnel udp over ssh
 rieck	if a direct connection is not possible
 wiking	it's really nice that i dont have to reconnect all the time
 wiking	anyhow, i gotta go... bbl

 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, What do you think of classes that generate example data
 heiko	so far I did this in the target language/interface
 heiko	but it would be nice to have it central
 heiko	Would be just a few for me in order to demonstrate results
 heiko	and since the example require different number of samples, it would be cool to have a class generating the data
 heiko	(also for streaming)
 blackburn	heiko: why to do that?
 heiko	blackburn, I am asking
 blackburn	yeah I am too :)
 heiko	I would like to have some data generation methods that I can use from python and c++
 blackburn	where?
 heiko	these would come great for a demo of my new framwork
 heiko	currently I implemented this in python and c++ seperately
 blackburn	so you want to add C++ class that generates data
 blackburn	right?
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	just for examples
 blackburn	heiko: have you seen secret soeren's photo?
 heiko	what? :)
 blackburn	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/sonne.jpg
 heiko	oh blackburn, I think for now we should change the link of the \shogunclass to the nightly doxygen
 heiko	but I forgot the link
 heiko	whooo, where does that come from? :D
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I don't really remember nightly link as well
 rieck	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/sonne.jpg hahaha! not bad
 droopy	yep
 heiko	blackburn, where does that photo come from? ;)
 blackburn	heiko: from my gimp :)
 blackburn	rieck: have you seen him in that 'suit'? :)
 rieck	blackburn: yes, often he's wearing such things in the office.
 blackburn	I thought so
 heiko	blackburn, what about the data gen classes?, any opinion?
 blackburn	heiko: no idea actually
 blackburn	I'd like data get methods more
 blackburn	gen*
 heiko	what?
 blackburn	data gen methods I mean
 heiko	yeah but where?
 blackburn	features may be
 blackburn	or may be one class generating all the stuff
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 heiko	one class for all
 heiko	ok, Ill add such a thing in features
 heiko	might be usefull for a lot of examples actually
 blackburn	agree
 heiko	one thing that is better for fixed datasets: You can assert results
 heiko	But we could do that via seeding
 heiko	if data is generated randomly
 heiko	is seeding platform independent?
 heiko	in shogun?
 blackburn	I hope so
 blackburn	heiko: I have some strange issue with subset
 blackburn	heiko: should subset be sorted?
 heiko	blackburn, no, no need for that
 heiko	whats the issue?
 blackburn	heiko: what is default subset?
 heiko	no subset
 heiko	so empty stack
 blackburn	oh lol :D
 heiko	then the mapping method just returns original index
 blackburn	sorry
 blackburn	I just called it two times
 blackburn	on features
 heiko	you dont add a [0:100] subset
 heiko	oh yeah :)
 blackburn	instead of calling on features and labels
 heiko	blackburn do you know the computational costs of computing eigenvalues in our SGVector method?
 heiko	cannot find that
 blackburn	eigenvalues of sgvector??
 blackburn	heiko: what is lapack routine?
 heiko	syev
 blackburn	syev is something n^3/3 or so
 blackburn	heiko: IIRC it is cholesky + iterative refinement
 heiko	so?
 blackburn	heiko: so n^3/3
 blackburn	+ some n^2
 heiko	kk
 blackburn	heiko: actually all eigendecompositions are sticked to n^3

 heiko	what if one doesnt want to compute *all* of them
 heiko	then costs decrease massively right=?
 blackburn	heiko: sorry alt+f4 spree
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	all of eigenvalues?
 rieck	droopy: cholesky + iterative refinement?
 droopy	rieck: i have a very good name of pirate
 blackburn	heiko: arpack is probably the coolest way of computing a few eigenpairs of symmetrical matrix
 blackburn	it is kind of lanczos and krylov subspace mix up so requires only mat-vec products
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	but we dont have a wrapper right?
 heiko	would be cool to have
 blackburn	for arpack? sure we have
 blackburn	I use it everywhere in converters
 blackburn	heiko: which eigenvalues you want to compute?
 heiko	of a kernel matrix
 blackburn	I mean which, largest or smallest?
 blackburn	there are actually one way with lapack too
 blackburn	http://www.netlib.org/lapack/double/dsyevr.f
 heiko	largest
 heiko	maybe we should add a method to SGMatrix for that
 heiko	would be nice to have!
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@202.130.113.141] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 heiko	usually one doesnt use all EV
 blackburn	hah I just googled for arpack
 blackburn	and found that one guy in blender made a C port for his purposes
 blackburn	people are crazy
 blackburn	heiko: simplest is to use dsyevr I think
 heiko	ok, could you add that? or should I?
 blackburn	add what?
 heiko	should look similar to the compute_eigenvalues we have
 heiko	but just with additional arugment for n largest EV
 heiko	a wrapper
 heiko	since I dont want to mess with messy LAPACK API ;)
 blackburn	heiko: I could
 blackburn	ah one question before
 blackburn	is it dense matrix?
 blackburn	if so no need to even try arpack or anything
 blackburn	heiko: I will add in a few minutes
 heiko	blackburn, thanks!
 heiko	dense matrix
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	but test it ;)
 heiko	I will ;)
 heiko	add a unit test
 droopy	;>
 blackburn	heiko: ok api is
 blackburn	596 void SGMatrix<T>::compute_few_eigenvectors(const double* matrix, double*& eigenvalues, double*& eigenvectors,
 blackburn	597                                            int n, int m, int il, int iu)
 blackburn	heiko: i let you allocate memory for eigenvalues and eigenvectors by yourself ;)
 heiko	blackburn, why not adding a default parameter to existing method
 blackburn	heiko: how?
 blackburn	what are parameters?
 heiko	dont you have the SGMatrix.h file? :)
 blackburn	heiko: what are default parameters I could add?
 heiko	I would just add num_eigenvalues=-1 in the header
 heiko	oh, 0 or negative number
 heiko	and then check in method to decide which lapack method to use
 blackburn	but you would need smallest or largest eigenvalues option then
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	true
 heiko	dont know :)
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@111.120.69.121] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko: ok ready, let me smoke test it
 blackburn	I do not really understand why you don't love lapack's api :D
 wiking	heiko: do u agree about mock?
 heiko	wiking, I think I dont know enough about that to give an opinion, but I agree that we need to test abstract classes
 heiko	I just saw your comment, havent read that yet
 wiking	heiko: okok no worries
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf4b3852 / (src/shogun/lib/SGMatrix.cpp src/shogun/lib/SGMatrix.h): Added compute few eigenvectors routine - http://git.io/pZffOw
 wiking	you'll see that we'll need mocking fw as well
 blackburn	heiko: test/taste it ;)
 wiking	heiko: to be able to test more complex things we'll need it, but then we'll need to discuss where to put those code... anyhow i guess ppl r going to be more active - hopefully - tomorrow
 heiko	wiking, yes agreed in both points
 heiko	blackburn, thanks!
 wiking	btw the api of SGVector is really getting a mess
 wiking	with all these extra stuff with cblas
 wiking	they should be included within a more general func calls like operator += and such

 wiking	nw
 blackburn	wiking: don't use it
 wiking	blackburn: what? :)
 wiking	blackburn: ah the api that i dont like? :D
 blackburn	wiking: sgvector += etc
 blackburn	use eigen3 inside
 wiking	shiiiit
 wiking	can we do x-compile with shogun?
 wiking	mm it seems not really :)
 blackburn	what is x-compile?
 wiking	cross-compile
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@111.120.69.121] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 wiking	you know when u compile the binary on a machine for another arch
 wiking	like compiling stuff for arm on x86
 wiking	since your x86 is much faster with compiling the binary than your ar
 blackburn	ah
 wiking	mmm it's running
 wiking	wonder what will be the end of this :DDD
 blackburn	well is it shogun problem?
 blackburn	I mean if gcc can handle this
 blackburn	why shogun can't
 wiking	blackburn: it's more like a ./configure hack
 blackburn	well just manually edit
 blackburn	.config
 blackburn	and here you go
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	to be able to set up well your crosscompiler enviroment via ./configure
 wiking	to try to link against the right libs... etc
 wiking	anyhow now it compiles
 wiking	so let's see where it might die
 blackburn	what is your target?
 wiking	armhf
 wiking	namely raspberry pi
 blackburn	omfg
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	just wanna test how it would work out on it :)
 blackburn	I am curious
 wiking	i mean the other i've checked an iphones license stuff
 wiking	and libsvm's license is in it :)
 wiking	i wonder for they are using that lib in the phone :)
 blackburn	libsvm in iphone??
 wiking	yep
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	that's really interesting
 wiking	dunno for what is it there
 wiking	but the license is there
 blackburn	wiking: where did you find it?
 wiking	settings->general->about->license
 blackburn	hmm okay no way for me :)
 droopy	hrhr
 wiking	ok sorry it's instead of license it's Legal Notices
 blackburn	I mean I am not apple user :)
 droopy	yeah
 wiking	the 2011 license is in there
 wiking	blackburn: yeah i've got that part ;)
 wiking	but yeah it's there and something is using it :D
 blackburn	that sounds like svm success story
 wiking	btw what happened with that opencl try back in march?
 blackburn	wiking: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqDqvKYDv9M&feature=player_detailpage
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	so it sank
 wiking	i still haven't figured out wtf is happening with my NIS server but let see maybe i can get you the passwd working blackburn  ;)
 blackburn	argh
 wiking	mm i think i have a problem in pam.d
 wiking	blackburn: try now
 wiking	blackburn: should be able to login
 wiking	and even to change the passwd
 wiking	oh shit something agian
 wiking	ok i know
 blackburn	wiking: let me find url again :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, did you finally get the website to work?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't even try
 gsomix	sonney2k, http://cat.sonnenburgs.de.meowbify.com/soeren/category/
 gsomix	meow
* sonney2k wonders which internet meme will hit #shogun / the mailinglist next
@sonney2k	and who will be the next superhero to the rescue of course :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I was like *megarotflbtc* seen what was going on between you / heiko
 blackburn	sonney2k: in pics?
 blackburn	yeah that was pretty funny :)
 wiking	http://www.tugberkugurlu.com/Content/images/Uploadedbyauthors/wlw/1934ffeb460c_FB47/you-need-some-tests-yo.jpg
@sonney2k	wiking, btw about the tests - is it possible to keep these in a separate dir? I liked heikos idea of having a tests/shogun/<dir structure replicated>
 wiking	;)
 droopy	8)
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah shouldn't be a problem at all...
 wiking	sonney2k: it's just going to be a bit funky to keep somehow in sync the directory structure
@sonney2k	gsomix, miau is the German term for that :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, huh, ok. :)
 wiking	sonney2k: or u trust everybody that they are going to be concious enough about that? :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, but funny - didn't know that stuff exists :)
@sonney2k	wiking, well at least I know at least one other big java project that does exactly that
@sonney2k	and there are people doing the PR merges
@sonney2k	so renames should not be too hard to detect
@sonney2k	wiking, ^
 wiking	sonney2k: okey
 wiking	sonney2k: then i'll just git mv those stuff
 wiking	sonney2k: src/tests/...
 wiking	?
 wiking	right?
@sonney2k	no
 wiking	sonney2k: ./tests...?
@sonney2k	not sure - we currently have ../testsuite
@sonney2k	we need some better name for that
 wiking	we can make ./unit-tests
 wiking	and then it's solved
@sonney2k	or ../tests and then unit_test / regression_tests ?
@sonney2k	I mean move testsuite -> ../tests/regression_tests?
@sonney2k	I don't have a proper name for these btw
 wiking	mmm
@sonney2k	but I would prefer one directory for all tests (with subdirectories...)
 wiking	anyhow i think having some funky git-hooks would be great after we create the unit-testing
@sonney2k	?
 wiking	is there a way to add git-hooks in github?
@sonney2k	for what?
@sonney2k	doing what?
 wiking	well git is very powerful with hooks
 wiking	so you can make a hook that it doesn't take in a commit
 wiking	if u don't define for example corresponding unit tests for the new class
@sonney2k	*urgs* that is tough
@sonney2k	no idea if that is possible
@sonney2k	and if that is what we want
 wiking	i mean u dont want to take commits without at least adding the correspoinding unit test.cc under unit tests dir
@sonney2k	because PR mergers check for tests once we have the infrastructure
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i mean this would just take off some load from the admins

 wiking	funnily
 wiking	i've seen somebody done this with python
 wiking	on a project
 wiking	there's a pre-commit hook
 wiking	and if the unit testing fails
 wiking	it doesn't allow u to commit ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, well I don't mind but lets get the infrastructure set up fist
@sonney2k	first
@sonney2k	so ../tests/unit ?
@sonney2k	so ../tests/regression ?
@sonney2k	or what?
 wiking	what's actually now in testsuites?
@sonney2k	wiking, the regression tests running large examples and checking if the output is still the same
 wiking	heiko: how do u feel about that awesomeness? :D
 wiking	sonney2k: ok well then yeah
 wiking	git add tests && git mv testsuits tests/regression && git add tests/unit
@sonney2k	I would expect some unit tests to be regression tests too but hey...
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah especially if we'll use mocking
@sonney2k	blackburn, any comments?
 wiking	heiko: http://bbgen.net/blog/2011/06/junit-git-hooks/
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	uhoh
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: haaard to think
 wiking	blackburn: think harder :)
 droopy	:)
 blackburn	I hardly think hard
 wiking	droopy: get some vodka for blackburn
 droopy	wiking: +m please!?!
 wiking	:DDDDDDD
 heiko	whats going on here? ;D
 wiking	heiko: discussing unit testing framework
 heiko	alright, this site describes a nice thing that we should have!
 wiking	heiko: i've just solved the thing for you: adding unit testing into git pre-commit hook so that u cannot commit unless the unit testing succesfully runs
@sonney2k	blackburn, get some vodka^H^H^H^Hfuel
 heiko	wiking, that is awesome!
 wiking	heiko: yeah it'd be awesome i think as well
 wiking	heiko: same can be done with valgrind
 blackburn	I am just not drunk enough to discuss
 heiko	sonney2k, I saw a strange picture of you ;)
 wiking	heiko: for mem leaks
 heiko	wiking wow
 heiko	you really get into that!
 blackburn	pre-commit hook is something interesting
 blackburn	problem is
 heiko	hey blackburn, this time, I am a bit drunk too! :)
 blackburn	how can we
 blackburn	work on something when something is broken?
 blackburn	heiko: I am not at all unfortunately ;(
 heiko	cant we just turn it off via a flag in this case?
 wiking	heiko: heheh now the question is whether we can add hooks in github
 droopy	great wiking
 wiking	heiko: so that when you fork git repo for yourself then you actually get the pre-commit hook as well
 heiko	wiking, I mean if its too hard, we can just rely on people performing tests before submitting patches
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	thats better
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is not for *running* the test - just for checking that it is there
@sonney2k	so that is not a problem
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	so we check
 blackburn	whether class has a test?
@sonney2k	wiking, ^ ?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah we can do that
@sonney2k	blackburn, is the directory structure good for you?
 blackburn	yeah I am ok with it
 wiking	sonney2k: and run unit testing as well as part of the pre-commit
@sonney2k	heiko, ?
@sonney2k	ok too?
 wiking	sonney2k: so that way buildbots will have less erros ;)
 heiko	yes
 wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll run that command now in my utests branch
 wiking	sonney2k: and re-do the Makefile...
 wiking	sonney2k: but i think you should really check my changes in Makefile.template and ./configure
 wiking	sonney2k: just that u agree with them... i'm sure there's some funkyshit i shouldn't have done there
@sonney2k	wiking, actually I don't expect fewer buildbot failures - people just never build shogun for all interfaces / all configs
@sonney2k	e.g. heiko never builds with lapack disabled
 wiking	sonney2k: :))) ok then i was wrong... anyhow
 wiking	then i'll do the quick changes now
 wiking	do and extra commit and let's see how we proceed
 wiking	i'll add google mock checking as well
 wiking	since we'll most definitely will need that stuff
 heiko	wiking is the abstract class thing soved already?
 wiking	for making more complex running checks
 wiking	heiko: google mock will solve it for us
 wiking	heiko: and with this directory struct
@sonney2k	mock mock hurray!
 wiking	heiko: it'll be not confusing at all
 heiko	nice!
 heiko	now not even we are paid by google, we are even using their frameworks
 wiking	:>
 wiking	lol
 wiking	mmm find script to regenerate the dir structure ... :>
 wiking	sonney2k: do we want tests/unit/interface
 wiking	afaik there won't be such
 wiking	sonney2k: it should be just tests/unit/<directories under src/shogun>
 wiking	or?
@sonney2k	wiking, this is what I understood is what you / heiko want
 wiking	yep
 wiking	doing it
@sonney2k	keeping the core sane and interface tests will be another chapter
 wiking	sonney2k:  is it ok if i write a simple Makefile by hand in tests/unit/ ?
 wiking	sonney2k: one thing
 wiking	sonney2k: imo libshogun should not be installed anywhere for unit tests
 wiking	sonney2k: i.e. we shouldn't do it as for the examples...

 wiking	sonney2k: and that'll be hard to require having libshogun locally built under ./src/shogun from ./tests/unit
 wiking	any ideas how to solve this?
 wiking	within a Makefile context?
 wiking	so that if you do cd tests/unit && make then if ./src/shogun/libshogun.<dynamiclibrary> is not present then the building of the library is first called...
 wiking	sonney2k: ^
 wiking	moreover i need some variables set in src/.config that is present only after ./configure has been exectuted... :S

 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, what do you think of letting the buildbot compile the tutorial and produce a nightly latest version as for the doxygen?
 blackburn	yeah we would need it at some point and may be even now
 heiko	this way everybody could always read the current version without having to git pull and LaTeX around?
 wiking	heiko: second that
