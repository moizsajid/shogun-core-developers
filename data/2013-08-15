@sonney2k	moin gsomix_ !
@sonney2k	gsomix_, any news on libsvm format?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, moin. working. last days was hard: many work at home. today I'm totally free.
 gsomix_	sonney2k, btw I realized that don't need any external convert sparse->dense methods.
 gsomix_	because it brings overhead
@sonney2k	gsomix_, lets get this done today then
@sonney2k	gsomix_, why don't you need any sparse -> dense?
@sonney2k	well ok if you knew how many examples and the max dim then yes
 gsomix_	sonney2k, because sparse -> dense can create big dense matrix while converting.
 gsomix_	so, we should directly read/write without intermediate converting
@sonney2k	gsomix_, but you don't know how many dims it will have
@sonney2k	gsomix_, it might be that in the last line there is an entry <huge_dim>:number
@sonney2k	so you might have to resize
@sonney2k	gsomix_, the only way I see is to read the file twice again
 gsomix_	I can use double reading, for example.
 gsomix_	yep
@sonney2k	ok then do it
 gsomix_	sonney2k, btw. about labels

 thoralf	wiking: Great! :)
 thoralf	wiking: What I like about the new cmake system most: Compilation of tests/examples is now parallelized as well.
 thoralf	wiking: Compiliing shogun in 1 minute :)
@wiking	thoralf: just tested it with totally disabling all my NICs
@wiking	and it worked
@wiking	thoralf: u can run ctest with -j option as well
@wiking	if u have more cores
 thoralf	wiking: I'm already using -j16, but the old system didn't parallelize example and/or test compilation.

 thoralf	sonne|work: I just tried to make a PR out of my patch and saw the conflicts.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Yeah, good work.
 sonne|work	wiking: can we make it in a way that putting the tgz's in that dir will make it use them?
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean such that one can place the sources there somehow?

@wiking	sonne|work: currently with eigen and json it's like that
@wiking	sonne|work: either you let it to download or you can put there yourself the files
@wiking	sonne|work: so for example in case of JSON you would need to do: mkdir -p third_party/JSON
@wiking	sonne|work: then then just copy there the json-c-0.11-nodoc.tar.gz file
@wiking	sonne|work: similar for Eigen: mkdir -p third_party/Eigen and then just copy there the eigen3_3.1.2.orig.tar.bz2 file
@wiking	sonne|work: in case of GoogleMock: mkdir -p third_party/GoogleMock and then svn checkout there the right revision
@wiking	sonne|work: or of course u let cmake do this for you
 thoralf	sonne|work: Does it still make sense to compile shogun *withou* USE_REFERENCE_COUNTING?
@wiking	thoralf: that is a way to try to have r_modular

 lisitsyn	wiking: from what he see hoard sucks :D
@wiking	lisitsyn: yep
@wiking	lisitsyn: but it's not sooo conclusive
 lisitsyn	wiking: why?
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://maeth.com/shogun_malloc_stats/libshogun-basic_minimal.png
@wiking	it has a longer loading time
 lisitsyn	they advertise it to be quite fast blabla
@wiking	i mean these tests are not actually doing too extensive memory usage
@wiking	so yeah maybe hoard is great when u really start eating memory
@wiking	but the loading time is long...
 lisitsyn	wiking: it is stated it is used in some servers
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i guess when something is running as daemon forever
 lisitsyn	it doesn't really matter how slow is warm-up for them I suppose
@wiking	then you dont have this problem
@wiking	anyhow jemalloc seems to be more consistent of all
@wiking	http://maeth.com/shogun_malloc_stats/libshogun-regression_gaussian_process_laplace.png
 lisitsyn	wiking: it is not worth the game from such plots
 lisitsyn	0.016 vs 0.019 :D whatever
@wiking	ehheh
@wiking	yeah true
@wiking	but then again
@wiking	osx malloc is a jemalloc branch...
@wiking	;0
@wiking	:O
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://maeth.com/shogun_malloc_stats/libshogun-so_multiclass_BMRM.png
@wiking	or of course http://maeth.com/shogun_malloc_stats/libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_multiclass_svm.png
@wiking	i mean that two test was actully really better with jemalloc...
 lisitsyn	wiking: the difference is like 0.25s
@wiking	yeah and it's a small little example both
@wiking	moreover it's nothing to do with gnu malloc...
@wiking	osx malloc is a based fbsd which is jemalloc based
@wiking	if anybody has some more heavy test out there plz just send it or test it ;)
@wiking	the cmake is ready to find and use different malloc libraries

@wiking	doh
@wiking	"C++ allows you to replace operator new. If this replacement operator new calls je_malloc, then std::allocator will indirectly call je_malloc, and in turn all standard containers will."
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	and "there's no guarantee that the non-replaced operator new calls malloc"
@wiking	i think i need to mod memory.cpp for this as well

@wiking	iglesiasg: no
@wiking	it was just a hickup
@iglesiasg	I keep on getting this error when compiling with testing enabled
@iglesiasg	http://pastebin.com/8yXqcUax
@wiking	iglesiasg: yeah i just had the same problem with embedding jemalloc into shogun
@iglesiasg	I don't get why it doesn't use the gtest that it downloads
@wiking	iglesiasg: and now i've found a solution fo rit
@wiking	iglesiasg: basically the order of -I flags matters
@iglesiasg	oh, messy
@wiking	iglesiasg: and i guess /usr/include has higher prio
@iglesiasg	I understand
@wiking	iglesiasg: so i have to add the -I flag before anything
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	and it makes sense
@wiking	iglesiasg: i think i have a solution but i'm just testing it
@iglesiasg	/usr/include can be understood as some sort of default
@wiking	in worst case we move from #include <gtest/gtest.h> to #include "gtest/gtest.h"
@iglesiasg	so it makes sense to put the one we want to force first
@wiking	and then i think using -iquote will win this game
@wiking	iglesiasg: u could try it as well
@wiking	iglesiasg: as my compile is slow
@wiking	tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt
@wiking	line 12
@wiking	include_directories(${INCLUDES} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src  ${source_dir}/include ${source_dir}/gtest/include)
@wiking	instead of this do
@wiking	include_directories(${source_dir}/include ${source_dir}/gtest/include ${INCLUDES} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src)
@wiking	and let's hope it works
@iglesiasg	wiking, ok
@wiking	mmm for me atm it's not working :S
@wiking	:(
@wiking	the order is changed but still /usr/include overrides it it seems
@iglesiasg	wiking, should I rm -rf build afterwards?
@iglesiasg	too bad
@wiking	nah
@wiking	cmake should just restart if you type make after those changes
@wiking	let's see what happens with u
@wiking	but i suspect it's going to be the same
@iglesiasg	wiking, it actually worked this time
@iglesiasg	wiking, compiled went smooth
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	wtf :)
@iglesiasg	wiking, I opened ccmake configured and generated before running make though
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	cmake would have done that automagically by just typing cmake
@wiking	i mean
@wiking	make
@iglesiasg	my shogun-unit-test executable appeared this time so it worked!
@wiking	iglesiasg: cool
@wiking	commit and push
@wiking	iglesiasg: i've realised that my problem is coming from something else ;P
@iglesiasg	wiking, there you go https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1427
@iglesiasg	wiking, you are the cmake guy, so approve that if so ;)
@iglesiasg	I am off for a while now
@wiking	gnite
@wiking	i'll w8 for the travis
@wiking	just to be 100% ;)
@iglesiasg	wiking, good idea
