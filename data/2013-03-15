@sonney2k	blackburn, the release script failed yesterday
@sonney2k	I will try to fix it...
 blackburn	sonney2k: uh I am unable to use anything but windows here so not much help
 wiking	sonney2k: check tagging as well as that failed last time as well. along with the commit code in the header
@sonney2k	wiking, you can check too then :)
@sonney2k	but I am far from that currently
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	which one is actually the release scipt :)
 wiking	script
@sonney2k	wiking, look in the top level makefile
@sonney2k	there is a howto with steps at the top
@sonney2k	it fails at the first (make prepare-release)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: any news regarding the dropdown menu?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no was dead tired yesterday (still am but...)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, btw what about c-base? did you get to talk to them?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	green light
 n4nd0	that's good, independent for what :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, the decision to have the workshop at c-base was decided with unanimous assent
 n4nd0	wow that's a success

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: release makefile fixes
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: -run configure before make ChangeLog to ensure .config is present
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: -don't make distclean to ensure that lib/versionstring.h is still present
 heiko	sonney2k: hi! whats the state?
 wiking	sonney2k: can we change some config stuff for 2 bots?

@sonney2k	heiko, running make prepare-release now...
@sonney2k	wiking, yes sure
@sonney2k	wiking, tell me what to do where
 wiking	sonney2k: so the two bots: fbsd: switch it to clang
 wiking	ubu: change -j4 to -j2 plz
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n141-p108.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	wiking, what is the cmdline for clang?
 wiking	it's simply clang
 wiking	it's in default path
@sonney2k	ok but I guess clang++ then right?
 wiking	clang and clang++
 wiking	yes
@sonney2k	ok

@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build libshogun_freebsd
 shogun-buildbot	no such builder 'libshogun_freebsd'
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build "bsd1 - libshogun"
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 11m48s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build "ubu1 - libshogun"
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 19m42s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	does anyone here use windows and knows how to force an autologin of a specific user?
 blackburn	sonney2k: which version of shindows?
@sonney2k	I hate that each and every windows update restarts the machine and kills the buildbot until I manually login...
@sonney2k	7
 shogun-buildbot	build #795 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/795
@sonney2k	blackburn, found sth
@sonney2k	http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/auto-logon-windows-7.htm
 blackburn	I remember there was some way through registry - I expect it is based on the same
@sonney2k	wiking, look at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/795/steps/test/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	tests won't work on fbsd w/ clang
 shogun-buildbot	build #796 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/796  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 blackburn	ha, probably http://vcgl.jacobs-university.de/projects/smoothviz/ is going to use tapkee for some visualization purposes
 wiking	sonney2k: lolface
 wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll debug
 blackburn	wiking: unknown type name 'string'; did you mean 'String'
 blackburn	wiking: ohhh sweet compiler mixed up what language it compiles in
 wiking	sonney2k: ok i've got it
 wiking	sonney2k: clang version shitfuck
 wiking	sonney2k: can u plz leave it like as it is now
 wiking	sonney2k: the system of that jail will be upgraded soon => newer clang, which compiles it fine
 wiking	FreeBSD clang version 3.0 (branches/release_30 142614) 20111021
 wiking	is having some issues
 n4nd0	one question about director classes guys
 wiking	but FreeBSD clang version 3.1 (branches/release_31 156863) 20120523
 wiking	seems to handle it right
 wiking	unfortunately i haven't got time yet to get that jail's base system upgraded
 n4nd0	if there are two methods that are to be implemented in the target language and they have the same number of arguments
 n4nd0	such as the two versions of get_joint_feature_vector here
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/structure/DirectorStructuredModel.h
 n4nd0	how can the difference be pointed out from the target language to which of the methods is being implemented?
 n4nd0	I think it can't
 n4nd0	and that one of them should be done implemented in C++
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't think that is possible
@sonney2k	different name...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I agree
 n4nd0	I will change the DirectorStructuredModel
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: buildmaster reconfigured: bot disconnecting]
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	so one of the methods is going to be implemented in the target language, and the other method calls it
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build "bsd1 - libshogun"
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 11m48s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't know what happens
 shogun-buildbot	build #797 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/797
@sonney2k	yay! we have some crashers on make prepare-release /examples/undocumented/libshogun/evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl
@sonney2k	classifier_svmocas_objective.m of octave static
@sonney2k	features_dot_wdfeatures.m octave_static
 wiking	do we have a release? :)

 wiking	sonney2k: whereabouts
@sonney2k	wiking, what is the name of gcc on you bsd machine?
@sonney2k	and g++?
 wiking	ah u wanna switch back?
 wiking	i mean it's only gtest that cannot run with clang atm
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah sure I want to switch back
@sonney2k	what could be more important than tests?
 wiking	i remember there was a little bit more hacks around g++46 and gcc46
 wiking	we needed to add some extra clfags
 wiking	as it was using 4.2's libs/headers
 wiking	mmm wait
 wiking	it's easy to get back the config
 wiking	/usr/local/bin/bash -c 'cd src && ./configure --cc=gcc46 --cxx=c++46 --interfaces= --gtest=/home/wiking/gmock-1.6.0/gtest --gmock=/home/wiking/gmock-1.6.0 --prefix=`pwd`/build' in dir /usr/home/wiking/shogun-buildbot/bsd1_-_libshogun/build (timeout 1200 secs)
 wiking	this was the configure line
 wiking	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc46/
 wiking	this was set as well
@sonney2k	gcc46 not gcc-46 ahh
