@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
@lisitsyn	wiking: el pongo!
@wiking	^
@wiking	;)
@wiking	general search engine meeting in #shogun :)
@wiking	only google missing
@wiking	and then we are good :P
@wiking	if u know what i mean :)
@wiking	(do we count bing as a search engine?)
@lisitsyn	hmm yahoo yandex
@lisitsyn	what else?
@wiking	lisitsyn: googs
@lisitsyn	do we have googlers here?
@wiking	that's missing :)
@lisitsyn	ahh
@wiking	noup
@lisitsyn	well there is also baidu bing whatever
@wiking	heheheh
@wiking	baidu is huge
@wiking	but bing? give me a break :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: well bing has bigger market share than ya :)
@lisitsyn	65% or russia is nothing worldwide
@lisitsyn	of*
@wiking	in the world?
@lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	i mean yahoo is huuuuge in usa
@lisitsyn	really? someone using it?
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	I have no idea what is it for
@lisitsyn	when I search in english I use google
@wiking	heheheh
@wiking	so yeah we need a googler
@wiking	lets send heiko there :)
@wiking	but yeey
@wiking	\o/ we have r modular
@wiking	and a lot of broken shit again :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: what's with r-modular? is it working yet?
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah it's like super working now :)
@wiking	matt fixed it
@wiking	so now we only have to fix 3.x swig problem
@wiking	 :DDDDD
@lisitsyn	wiking: sounds good
@wiking	and of course c# modular
@wiking	that is utterly broken with a decent mono version
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	travis is dying every day
@wiking	because it cannot handle the modular interface source size anymore
@wiking	:)
@wiking	so there's a lot of problems still
@lisitsyn	wiking: and then finally start doing something for distributed computations :D
@wiking	hahah lol
@wiking	that's lke
@wiking	crazy
@wiking	i mean look at where we are
@wiking	people are nowadays like
@wiking	Mapreduce... it's soooooooo yesterday
@wiking	whereas we: distributed, what? :D
@wiking	at least now we have GPU backend
@wiking	finally something modernish :P
 matt|work	wiking: what is this 3.x swig problem?
@wiking	matt|work: ah you r here? :)
@wiking	awesomeness again for the r modular patch
 matt|work	no problem, it was almost disappointing that the fix was only like 6 lines :)
@wiking	matt|work: first i thought that this is only happening on osx, but apparently it's everywhere. swig3.x generated modular intefraces are just segfaulting
 matt|work	Hmmm good to know, I'm just recompiling shogun with swig 3.0.2 :/
@wiking	matt|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2313
@wiking	matt|work: good luck have fun :)
@wiking	matt|work: what's you compiler?
@wiking	matt|work: i mean your c compiler
 matt|work	gcc (GCC) 4.8.2
@wiking	ok that's going to be insteresting
@wiking	as it has c++11 support
@wiking	but i've checked and it wasn't that that caused the trouble

@wiking	matt|work: mmm interesting
@wiking	besser82: which modular interface was segfaulting for you with swig 3.x?
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@93.114.45.13] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@besser82	wiking, basically all  :(
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	still?

@wiking	besser82: as matt|work just reported that he had no problem with swig 3.0.2 + r modular
@wiking	i still have segfault on osx :P
