@sonney2k	lisitsyn, look things compile now :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but now all tests fail http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2061/steps/test%20python%20modular/logs/stdio
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ah still this issue?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I can't see what's changed?
 lisitsyn	is that %feature ("ref") before include?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes it is before the include
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: usual swig magic
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you could write a book 'real life swig'
 lisitsyn	just one page
 lisitsyn	'if something doesn't work just change the order of something or add some forward declaration'
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah
@sonney2k	ok lets try to put the feature("ref") after the include stuff
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, how is life btw? still overloaded?
@sonney2k	or any improvement in sight?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh well yeah something is getting better actually
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about you?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I wonder whether you will ever have time for shogun again ...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am stucked accuracy wise with some detector, once I train it properly I am done :D
 lisitsyn	sounds easy
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I think so
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, it is really bad that heiko is still off for another month
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I have one major thing I want to change
 lisitsyn	it can't get out of my mind
 lisitsyn	these parameters
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	always on my mind
@sonney2k	heh
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah heiko is earth mover
 lisitsyn	but well it is somewhat good
@sonney2k	I want more cool demos / examples
@sonney2k	and debian etc packages
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: demos-wise I am much more prepared than before
@sonney2k	I really hope besser82 finishes his cmake endeavour sound
@sonney2k	soon
 lisitsyn	I use d3/whatever js stack at my job
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, cool
@sonney2k	so we should add some more cool ones

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, your road sign thing or some other obj detection stuff
@sonney2k	or whaterver
@sonney2k	I actually really think we should do all the teaching examples that people normally do in ML classes
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I want to understand what ML moves to and follow that
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I had a lot of fun with some changes I see
 lisitsyn	deep learning is not everywhere anymore
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and btw while we are at it - I am thinking of maybe we should have a weekly meeting - whoever has tiem can attend
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, just follow jmlr / nips / icml
 lisitsyn	well we can do that less official
 lisitsyn	just talk :D
@sonney2k	yes
 lisitsyn	whenever we can
@sonney2k	like a beer hour or sth
 lisitsyn	this normally worked before actually
@sonney2k	well no a fixed day with a fixed time
@sonney2k	so people know that everyone *tries* to be there
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: jmlr/nips/icml wise
 lisitsyn	you know I am not a ML researcher so can't really follow it deeply
@sonney2k	e.g some 30 mins slot
 lisitsyn	but I also can't get out of a feeling
 lisitsyn	that 95% is useless waste of paper
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well you are ML guyish enough

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes that is normal :D
 lisitsyn	I can't filter out things that are needed
 lisitsyn	and ones that are not
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but useless depends also an what you want tod od
@sonney2k	to do
 lisitsyn	oh yeah that makes me crazy
 lisitsyn	it is unresolved in my mind still
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I think science is always like this
@sonney2k	it explores all possible ways
@sonney2k	and there is of course some mainstream trend
@sonney2k	like say music genres
@sonney2k	or whatever mainstream movies
@sonney2k	and then the experimental stuff
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: music wise - I am into that now http://instagram.com/p/gqYIMWzfYs/
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	yeah you are young and ahve time :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw I also did some d3 at work
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: well I get back to home and have things to do with other work but just can't do anything
 lisitsyn	so I thought it would be good to learn some stuff haha
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah I remember you said about that
 lisitsyn	you were secret as usual so no idea
 lisitsyn	we use it to draw some time-space graph of railroad
 lisitsyn	in 24h scale
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well yeah I signed some contract right? So I better not break the rules...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: indeed :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: don't you feel all that web stuff is much more funnier that anything else?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah it is cool
@sonney2k	aha
 lisitsyn	I actually have some explanation
@sonney2k	/home/sonne/shogun/src/shogun/base/SGObject.h:102: Warning 401: Base class 'SGRefObject' undefined.
 lisitsyn	you see feedback instantly
 lisitsyn	the cycle is much shorter
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and it is eye candy
 lisitsyn	you just change something and you see it with your eyes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, problem though is that you cannot properly test things
 lisitsyn	no that's not that impossible
 lisitsyn	there are a lot of testing things for js

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, thanks! :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I guess it is the best decision you could make weather wise!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it actually snew in Spain a couple of days ago, but no snow in Stockholm yet this year, crazy!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, that reminds me of a visit of Barcelona a few years back where there were like 10cm snow
@sonney2k	I think in october / november
@iglesiasg	wow in Barcelona
@iglesiasg	beach place, so even more unlikely I guess!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, traffic broke down that day
@sonney2k	but snow was more a mush then real snow
@sonney2k	and I was 0% prepared for that

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, nice that you will continue the readme*md endaevour
@iglesiasg	everything broke down here when it snows, even if it is very very little
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sure

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, seen that http://www.p01.org/releases/wolfensteiny/ ?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ha! no
@sonney2k	http://www.p01.org/releases/tea_storm/tea_storm.htm
@sonney2k	I guess this guy would write shogun in .js in 10kb ;)
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	no :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you have any idea how I could in small incremental steps get rid of SGString* crap?
@sonney2k	and replace it with SGVector* goodness?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: incremental hmm
@sonney2k	I did a couple of attempts
@sonney2k	but they were all trying too much
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about typedef?
@sonney2k	so no way of every finishing
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ??
 lisitsyn	typedef SGVector SGString
@sonney2k	haha
 lisitsyn	with C++11 you can do template typedef
@sonney2k	that kaboom
 lisitsyn	yes of course
 lisitsyn	but you could change SGVector to support the same interface then
@sonney2k	well I would want to have something less drastic
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hmmhh
@sonney2k	I think there are 2 major steps
@sonney2k	1) is derive it from SGReferencedData
 lisitsyn	ahhhhhhh
 lisitsyn	SGString is not sgdata
 lisitsyn	sure sure
@sonney2k	2) switch over to ref'd
 lisitsyn	now I understand
@sonney2k	err vector
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	it is the only data type we didn't finish
@sonney2k	converting
 lisitsyn	many brave souls died during the first phase
 lisitsyn	remember I rolled things back
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, unfortunately
@sonney2k	you should have kept things
 lisitsyn	well it wasn't working at all
 lisitsyn	like you have everything failing
@sonney2k	maybe it is impossible to do 1) incrementally
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif
 lisitsyn	like that
@sonney2k	yeah it certainly is like that
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: well may be some solution would be
 lisitsyn	do 1) but don't delete
 lisitsyn	so you won't get terrible failures yet

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: don't include SGStringList in SGObject.h
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah maybe I can split it up even
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, first make SGStringList 'refable'
@sonney2k	and then later sgstring
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, haha
@sonney2k	SGStringList is already!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: one step done :D
@sonney2k	*lol*
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, actually one way to 'fix' things would be to make SGString 'refable' and then use only the 'disable refcount' constructor
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and then gradually switch over to use the refcount
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes makes sense
 lisitsyn	but I don't see gradually here
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	you just turn it on and then go to hospital to heal wounds
