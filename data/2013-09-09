@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'debian wheezy - memcheck'
 shogun-buildbot	build #4 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 hushell	iglesiasg: hey
@iglesiasg	hushell, hi there ,whats' up?
 hushell	iglesiasg: good, I am working on the python stuffs
@iglesiasg	hushell, examples?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so what's the stuff that needs to be done for the webpage?
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah, and I try to make an initial version of ipython notebook before implementing other solvers
@iglesiasg	hushell, it sounds cool!
 hushell	only 2 weeks left :(
@iglesiasg	hehe yep
 hushell	iglesiasg: Have you finished everything on the schedule?
@iglesiasg	hushell, pretty much yes
@iglesiasg	hushell, I have to test the method more though
@iglesiasg	for instance I am facing now some late convergence issue in my code
@iglesiasg	for a particular data set
@iglesiasg	the more data sets I use, the more flaws I find :D
 hushell	iglesiasg: that may be a problem for the LMNN, not your implementation
@iglesiasg	hushell, fortunately not, I checked in the author's implementation ;)
 hushell	When we should do the peer checks?
@iglesiasg	I think that they should be after this pencil downs date
@iglesiasg	so one week more for coding, and after that
 hushell	iglesiasg: strange issues always happen, this is why we are needed :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, indeed
 hushell	cool, then I have 7 days for preparing myself
@iglesiasg	hushell, I am not entirely sure though
@iglesiasg	let's check in the meeting logs
 shogun-buildbot	build #4 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/4
@iglesiasg	I think it is like that
 hushell	I checked the timeline on gsoc, I think that's what supposed to do in the last week
@iglesiasg	good then
 hushell	is the PR good to merge?
@iglesiasg	hushell, I think the code is good yeah
@iglesiasg	hushell, but something is wrong with Travis
 hushell	iglesiasg: but Travis failed for some reason
@iglesiasg	hushell, maybe it is unrelated to your PR
@iglesiasg	we should be sure of that
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah, let me check for a while
@iglesiasg	hushell, all right, thanks!
@iglesiasg	compare with the build history in travis, if other builds fail with the same error
@iglesiasg	then I think it is a great indicative that it is not something in your PR
 hushell	iglesiasg: I rebased again, how to check the travis history?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I saw it, build history
@iglesiasg	hushell, there is a tab called build history
@iglesiasg	good
 hushell	iglesiasg: thanks
@iglesiasg	hushell, you are welcome
 hushell	iglesiasg: seems the issues start from a day ago, recent commits all failed the same problem: python-integration-test and a lot of failures in java modular
@iglesiasg	hushell, ok! Then we are ready to go
 hushell	iglesiasg: let's wait the new commit finish. It's very late in your time
@iglesiasg	hushell, a little bit hehe
 hushell	iglesiasg: no hurry, we can do it tomorrow, I guess you are sleepy
@iglesiasg	hushell, yep, I was planning to shut down soon
@iglesiasg	hushell, ok cool
@iglesiasg	I might write some comments again though
@iglesiasg	I was not very thorough checking the pull request honestly
 hushell	iglesiasg: nice job!
@iglesiasg	hushell, what about Patric? Is he also having a look that everything goes in the right direction?
 hushell	I know checking code is even painful
 hushell	iglesiasg: haven't hear from him for a while, maybe I should send him an email before merging
@iglesiasg	hushell, that would be great, if he can have a look too
 hushell	iglesiasg: He just moved to Berlin
@iglesiasg	hushell, yep, I read something about his new job
 hushell	okay, let's postpone the merge
@iglesiasg	hushell, is it fine for you?
@iglesiasg	hushell, I don't know if you plan to submit something else soon that depends on this PR
 hushell	iglesiasg: it's fine for me. I have started a new branch to do python code
@iglesiasg	hushell, ok, but I gues you won't be able to merge until this one gets in, right?
@iglesiasg	I mean, your current branch starts from the tip of your develop in the PR I guess
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah, but the new PR will be a small one
@iglesiasg	well the thing is that those commits that are not in shogun develop yet but yes in your develop will pop up in the other PR as well
 hushell	yes, it depends on this one, but I guess rechecking is necessary, and you may not check the new PR until tomorrow
 hushell	iglesiasg: so you mean, I'll have to wait this one merged
@iglesiasg	hushell, yes
@iglesiasg	I think so, at least
 hushell	but since the python PR will be small, if there are conflicts, I can do vimdiff
@iglesiasg	good
@iglesiasg	all right, time to sleep then
@iglesiasg	good night!
 hushell	I was worrying about this, but will be ok
 hushell	good nite!

 gsomix	hi
 sonne|work	gsomix: hey there
 sonne|work	gsomix: how is it going?
 gsomix	sonne|work, fine. but I'm sick a little.
 gsomix	sonne|work, can you help me? I want to run integration tests.
 gsomix	for unit-tests I just execute 'ctest' command
 sonne|work	gsomix: unit or integration tests?
@wiking	sonne|work: yes
 gsomix	>> integration tests | this
 sonne|work	gsomix: ctest -R python_modular ?

 gsomix	sonne|work,
 gsomix	ctest -R python_modular
 gsomix	Test project /home/gsomix/Workspace/shogun/build
 gsomix	No tests were found!!!
 sonne|work	gsomix: but you did enable python modular did you?
 gsomix	let me check
 gsomix	sonne|work, cool, thanks. it was an confusion. =___=
 gsomix	sonne|work, but now fails tests that's different from Travis' output. ok, need check.
 sonne|work	gsomix: how is your protobuf stuff progressing?
 sonne|work	wiking: how difficult is it to add a protobuf check to CMake?
 sonne|work	all we need is test if protoc executable is available and can do protoc --cpp_out
@wiking	protobuf?
@wiking	ah you mean like a find_package?
@wiking	i would google first for
 sonne|work	wiking: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
@wiking	FindProtobuf.cmake
 sonne|work	yes
@wiking	i'm 100% sure
 sonne|work	like this
@wiking	that somebody already has written it
 sonne|work	https://github.com/trendmicro/tme/blob/master/src/cmake/FindProtobuf.cmake
 sonne|work	is it already in cmake?
@wiking	check it out
@wiking	/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules
@wiking	indeed it is
@wiking	(at least my cmake has it
 sonne|work	cool
 shogun-buildbot	build #7 of clang34 - static analysis is complete: Failure [failed analyse]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20static%20analysis/builds/7
 gsomix	sonne|work, not many. I was trying make some examples outside shogun. if we have protobuf support in shogun's cmake I can start porduce code for shogun.
 sonne|work	gsomix: no you can do it w/o that already
 gsomix	but now I want finish LibSVMFile support in examples.
 gsomix	I sent PR, but integration tests failde in Travis
 gsomix	*failed
 gsomix	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/11139454
 gsomix	that's very different from that I see on my local machine
 sonne|work	wiking: is there any chance to get a summary of failed tests with ctest? I have a hard time parsing the output :/
 gsomix	sonne|work, wiking intergrations tests generates from undocumented examples, right?
@wiking	sonne|work: ?
@wiking	sonne|work: end of the ctest is a summary
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh but then please run tester.py with single python script as argument otherwise it is impossible to see
@wiking	sonne|work: change it as u wish and commit
 sonne|work	wiking: now all integration tests are run in one go with tester.py
 sonne|work	that is why it is a mess(tm)
 sonne|work	wiking: cannot from work
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then when u can

 hushell	Hi guys, with swig python interfaces, if a class A needs a pointer (e.g. CFactorType*) as argument, can I pass an object B = FactorType(...)?
 hushell	pointer, reference in c++ are the same in python, right?
 hushell	I got an error saying: TypeError: in method 'new_TableFactor', argument 1 of type 'CTableFactorType *', but I have no idea how to deal with it

@wiking	sonne|work: sonne|work
@wiking	question about MulticlassOCAS
@wiking	you might remember it better
 sonne|work	ask
@wiking	do you think it'd be a problem
@wiking	user_data.W = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, (int64_t)num_features*num_classes); user_data.oldW = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, (int64_t)num_features*num_classes); user_data.new_a = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, (int64_t)num_features*num_classes); user_data.full_A = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, (int64_t)num_features*num_classes*m_buf_size); user_data.output_values = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, num_vectors);
@wiking	i mean at least user_data.W
@wiking	with calloc instead of mallco?
@wiking	this way i can supress a lot of conditional jump on uninitialised data errors with valgrind
@wiking	and possibly fix the hectic (sometimes fail) bug with the unit test
 sonne|work	wiking: if you do that you should check that this was a bug
@wiking	well we have this
 sonne|work	wiking: is it single core the test I mean?

 sonne|work	besser82: btw you can now run cmake when the .git dir is not available - please try!
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1411
 besser82	wiking, will do and report ;)
 besser82	wiking, thx!
@wiking	besser82: you mean sonne|work
@wiking	sonne|work: there's no multithread with ocas :)
 besser82	wiking, yes, just overlooked that, because you posted some link to gh issues ;)
 sonne|work	errm is it disabled?
@wiking	sonne|work: and yeah we had a lot of Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
 besser82	sonne|work, thanks will do! ;)
@wiking	with only malloc
@wiking	if i change user_data.W = SG_CALLOC(float64_t, (int64_t)num_features*num_classes);
 sonne|work	wiking: well ocas is parallelized
@wiking	then it's all gone
@wiking	where?
 sonne|work	so if we don't fix it to use a single thread we get different result
@wiking	but multiclassOcas.cpp has 0 lines of pthread
 gsomix	cool, evernote is very usable for storing parts of shogun's irc logs
 sonne|work	wiking: sure it is under the hod
 sonne|work	wiking: all encapsulated in dotfeatures
@wiking	sonne|work: i dont get it
 sonne|work	wiking: ?
@wiking	what does this have to do with having W initialised with random data

@wiking	or full 0
 sonne|work	wiking, has nothing to do with w
 sonne|work	wiking: but with a test failing from time to time
@wiking	sonne|work: ah that's another thing
@wiking	sonne|work: first i want to fix this Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
@wiking	so
 sonne|work	well you gave me the link
 sonne|work	so I was trying to find a reason
 sonne|work	not so much about your W=0
@wiking	so would it be a problem if W=0 and not W=(random)
-!- besser82 [~besser82@fedora/besser82] has quit [Quit: Verlassend]
 sonne|work	wiking: not a problem for sure but IDK if this was a bug!

 sonne|work	wiking: well set it to use CALLOC but we should check if it gives the same result like the orig mc ocas
@wiking	sonne|work: imho if i do SGVector::random(W) would surpress the error as well
 sonne|work	wiking: sure.
 sonne|work	my guess is that W=0 was intended
 sonne|work	but I am blind here - neither looking at code or anything

@wiking	ok we need to meeerge feature/SerialUTests
 sonne|work	wiking: btw could we integrate our unit tests w/ cmake the same way then? I mean that just a single unit test is run instead of all - so we see the proper cmake summary of test failures?
@wiking	sonne|work: i've done something different
@wiking	sonne|work: you'll see when i merge
 sonne|work	which is?
@wiking	basically i supress OK unittest prints
@wiking	and just print the error
@wiking	if there's
 sonne|work	currently the ctest output is not useful
@wiking	sonne|work: how so?
 sonne|work	I simply cannot figure out what fails
@wiking	there's the summary
@wiking	on the end of it
 sonne|work	well unit tests failed
 sonne|work	or integration tests failed is a bit too coarse
@wiking	The following tests FAILED: 1 - unit-test (SEGFAULT)
@wiking	and then u go there
@wiking	and check what really failed
@wiking	i mean what's so hard to find out
 sonne|work	I would rather want to see the exact name of the unit test
@wiking	sonne|work: not possible
@wiking	as unit test is just one ctest
 sonne|work	why not? we could run it with proper gtest filers
@wiking	either create as many unit test binaries as many tests there are
@wiking	filtering i dont see working
@wiking	or maybe
@wiking	but no
 sonne|work	if I look at this I don't see what fails http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1670/steps/test/logs/stdio
@wiking	so you cannot do the filtering
@wiking	 1 - unit-test (SEGFAULT)
@wiking	no?
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	yes some unit test fails and then?
@wiking	filtering is very cumbersom because you would need to know somehow the filter names prior having the binary (unit test) compiled...
@wiking	sonne|work: go to that test and see what happened there
 sonne|work	well which test?
@wiking	unit-test
@wiking	the first one
@wiking	you wont be able to know better if it's a segfault
 sonne|work	wiking: yes but which of the unit tests
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah with the current setup not
@wiking	sonne|work: go to the unit-test ctest
@wiking	and check it out
 sonne|work	if we would filter we would know exactly
@wiking	as i said before
@wiking	filtering is not possible
@wiking	you'll have to roll a unit test binary per
 sonne|work	and all we would need to do is filter the .cpp files for the tests
@wiking	sonne|work: no
@wiking	sonne|work: as it's not really the case...
@wiking	the name of the cpp is not the name of the test
 sonne|work	why not?
@wiking	well check it
@wiking	and you'll see
@wiking	and how do you do the template generated naming...
 sonne|work	well I checked - for the tests I've written ti would work
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah but there's like kazillion other tets
@wiking	that you have not written
@wiking	and see the templating problem
 sonne|work	you autogenerate this right so you can get the names of the tests
@wiking	ok
@wiking	do as u feel
@wiking	i'm just saying
@wiking	that this is going to be very cumbersom
@wiking	e
@wiking	rather go with compiling a unit test binary per cpp
@wiking	btw: Serialization is collidig
 sonne|work	I am also fine with that - anything that helps to pinpoint what failed
 sonne|work	wiking: you mean cannot be run in parallel?
 sonne|work	why not?

@wiking	you have io/Serialisation and io/Serialization_unittest.cc and base/Serialization_unittest.cc
@wiking	hence
@wiking	filtering is not really doing what u want either
@wiking	yeah u can run it in parallel ctest -j8
 sonne|work	what is the issue?
@wiking	i'm saying that the name is the same
@wiking	hence collision
@wiking	in naming
@wiking	anyhow i'm sure somebody already did this
@wiking	so it's wroth trying a google for it

@wiking	mmm we cannot write complex with HDF5?
 hushell	Hi iglesiasg, have you had the TypeError with swig python interfaces?
@iglesiasg	hushell, Hi. No, at least I don't remember having it.
@iglesiasg	hushell, where is it appearing?
 hushell	iglesiasg: there is an annoying error, when I want to create a CFactor(FactorType, ...) in python, it says the type of FactorType is wrong
@iglesiasg	hushell, mm I see.
@iglesiasg	let me check how FactorType looks like
@iglesiasg	hushell, does the error say something else?
 hushell	TypeError: in method 'new_TableFactor', argument 1 of type 'CTableFactorType *'
 hushell	sonne|work: I just need pass a pointer
@iglesiasg	hushell, what?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I asked the question before you joining :) sonne|work gave me some advice
@iglesiasg	hushell, so CFactor needs in the constructor a CTableFactorType*
 sonne|work	wiking: complex is very new in shogun...
 hushell	iglesiasg: you want to check the script I am testing?
 sonne|work	wiking: but better file a bug so we don't forget
@iglesiasg	hushell, are you giving it a CTableFactorType or a FactorType?
@iglesiasg	hushell, I am not sure if these two are related, you tell me :)
 sonne|work	hushell: that works then
 hushell	I am giving a TableFactorType, wait a second, I push this to a branch
 sonne|work	hushell: but you need to make TableFactoryType known in swig prior to TableFactor
 sonne|work	hushell: note that order in swigs .i files matters!
 hushell	the example is here: https://github.com/hushell/shogun/blob/py_fg/examples/undocumented/python_modular/structure_factor_graph_model.py
 hushell	look at line 32
 sonne|work	hushell: shure that works with swig
 sonne|work	hushell: I guess your include order in the .i files is wrong
 hushell	sonne|work: yes, I included the Factor.h before FactorType.h
 sonne|work	see kaboom :)
 hushell	let me try the reverse, I didn't expect this will cause errors

@iglesiasg	sonne|work is the master

@iglesiasg	wiking, any idea what's wrong with Python and Java modular in Travis?
@wiking	iglesiasg: python is broken because of integration tests
@wiking	iglesiasg: java is broken because of issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1557
@iglesiasg	wiking, do we need this +#ifdef EIGEN_MAPPED_SPARSEMATRIX_H?

@wiking	unit test
@wiking	sonne|work: btw here's your solution https://code.launchpad.net/~compiz-team/compiz/compiz.compiz_discover_tests/+merge/113324

@wiking	sonne|work: it's autoenabled ...
@wiking	except if u explicitly stat that u dont want
@wiking	*state
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh nice
@wiking	sonne|work: ok i think i've managed it
@wiking	sonne|work: currently with that script
@wiking	and binary
 sonne|work	wiking: ?

 sonne|work	wiking: did you do this already now or shall I continue?
 sonne|work	wiking: nice ! lets hope it works
@wiking	sonne|work: well this is specifically for gtest
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah but i thought you want like 1 ctest per 'module' e.g. CSVFileTest.* would be 1 ctest
@wiking	or?
 sonne|work	wiking: I am happy with anything pointing to at least a file to look at
@wiking	ok i'm testing now..
@wiking	heheh there are like 3000+ tests
@wiking	we'll have a problem :(

@wiking	the log is limited to 10000 lines and currently we already have like 5000 lines
@wiking	so if we have like 3000+ ctest and each ctest outputs (if it succeed) 2 lines => 2*3000 the best case..
@wiking	if it fails... well we are fucked :)
@wiking	but already with the non-failing case we exceed 10000 lines

 thoralf	wiking: Great error ;)
@wiking	yeah python3 is fun
@sonney2k	wiking, ohh strings are unicode now
@sonney2k	wiking, it means that the current alphabet (I guess DNA cannot contain a string 0xf1)
@sonney2k	but only A C G T chars
@wiking	mm
@wiking	well i guess there's a magic conversion function
@wiking	somewhere :)
 thoralf	Found a funny bug pattern, which could affect other classes as well: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1562
 thoralf	Just in case you see it somewhere else... anyway, is not fatal as long as you're passed objects have refcount > 1.

@sonney2k	vgorbati, we need some expert to look at this which I am not
@sonney2k	vgorbati, and I am knee deep in tons of other issues :/
 vgorbati	sonney2k: I see:) And who can be the expert?)
@sonney2k	wiking, great you managed to get precise to green
@sonney2k	vgorbati, some serious NN guy
 vgorbati	sonney2k: do you know such a guy?)
@sonney2k	vgorbati, the best would be if you could ask around in the community
@sonney2k	vgorbati, pretty clear that the big big shots won't listen but maybe they have some suggestion so asking won't hurt
 vgorbati	sonney2k: Ok, maybe I'll try:) But implementing NNs in general and embedding them in shogun is a bit different things. I mean, you could have noticed some wrong use of existing shogun classes or violation of some policy etc. - was there anything (besides commented issues)?
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsyn@fb2-lo1.global63.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	vgorbati, well rule is to not use std:: stuff in headers of classes that you swig wrap
@sonney2k	vgorbati, that's about it
 vgorbati	sonney2k: ok) Then I'll close the PR. Maybe I will open a new one if I eventually reach a point when there is something working (like some basic neural network topology, that can be created/trained/applied from interfaces)?
@sonney2k	vgorbati, to be really useful you should somehow connect to a NN expert who can guide you through the tricks of trade
@sonney2k	vgorbati, every ML algo and NNs in particular requires some tricks to work well
 vgorbati	sonney2k: well, I did take a look at existing python implementations (including projects, developed by some experts) + there are online courses on NNs, taught by Geoffrey Hinton, where he gives tips and trick on them
 vgorbati	sonney2k: as well as describing the algorithms pretty much in detail (course link - https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/class/index)

@wiking	sonney2k: but i know i have to push this fucking release :<
@sonney2k	wiking, well you have been messing this all day
@wiking	sonney2k: ok so question
@wiking	sonney2k: we have the SerialUtest branch
@sonney2k	and we've come a loong way today I would say
@wiking	where we added automatic tests
@wiking	for all the serialization outputs
@wiking	some of them fail obviously
@wiking	like HDF5 trying to write complex_t
@wiking	what do you way what should we do if that utest fail
@wiking	make it really fail
@wiking	or just return from the function silently?
@sonney2k	wiking, we need a blacklist
 vgorbati	sonney2k: I am sorry, did not get it - what do you mean by 'pushing it further'?
@wiking	sonney2k: and disable the test?
@wiking	which fails?
@wiking	ah ok
@sonney2k	vgorbati, to get it to be comparable to the state of the art
@wiking	that sounds reasonable
 shogun-buildbot	build #98 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/98
@wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll add DISABLED
@sonney2k	wiking, we need a way to disable tests
@wiking	and then gtest will complain that there are disabled tests
@wiking	sonney2k: TEST(whatever, testinfunction_DISABLE)
@wiking	automatically disables a unit test
@sonney2k	wiking, and have this list of disabled somewhere so we can always continue fixing things
@wiking	and gtest complains about that
@sonney2k	wiking, like we did before gsoc
@sonney2k	otherwise we would not have gotten anything merged
@wiking	ok
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, f... you!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@wiking	i'll do this now then
@wiking	and then merge that branch
@sonney2k	how can this osx machine fail
@wiking	because there's quite some fix there by heiko
@wiking	that solves some of the valgrind errors
 vgorbati	:D
@sonney2k	I did compare environment variables
@sonney2k	same
@sonney2k	^%$@%^#@^%#%^!!!
@wiking	sonney2k: run that bot with MAmake VERBOSE=1
@sonney2k	wiking, what was the command again to get a verbose outptut from cmake
@sonney2k	exactly
@wiking	 mean make VERBOSE=1
 vgorbati	sonney2k: what do you mean by 'it'?
@sonney2k	vgorbati, it == the/your implementation
 vgorbati	sonney2k: but I want to push it further:) Or do you mean that I am not skilled enough to make it?

@sonney2k	vgorbati, well you are not hinton so you will reach a point where someone who is doing this all his live will be of good use
@sonney2k	wiking, I found the reason (but not the cause): on the buildbot we do -isysroot /Applications/...blabla../MacOSX10.8.sdk
@sonney2k	wiking, if I add this then the compile failes
 vgorbati	sonney2k: I definitely do not pretend to do it as good as Hinton does:) But if I at least implement what I can (using existing implementations as reference) and if it works 'relatively well' - won't it be suitable to include in shogun?
@sonney2k	vgorbati, sure it would be sufficient
@wiking	sonney2k: lol...
 vgorbati	sonney2k: this is what I was talking about - if I implement some working topology like a basis to move forward (I won't bother you until I have some results that can be evaluated - like python example of usage on real data etc.) - can I then issue a PR with this implementation?
@sonney2k	wiking, what do we need that for?
@sonney2k	vgorbati, sure
@sonney2k	wiking, can't we just get rid of this or will package building fail then?

 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 5m55s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	lambday, argh
@wiking	let's see if it repeats itself :)
@wiking	ok time to see the templating magic i did in action
 lambday	sonney2k: I am fixing it to a fixed value
 shogun-buildbot	build #1681 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1681
@wiking	sonney2k: see
@wiking	sonney2k: random glitch
@sonney2k	lambday, thanks
@sonney2k	wiking, which will re-occur soon
@sonney2k	oh great statistics_quadratic_time_mmd.py is giving different results all the time
 lambday	sonney2k: sent the PR
@sonney2k	easy to fix - another random.seed was missing
@wiking	sonney2k: so thread analyzer bot... shall we?
 lambday	sonney2k: np :) still clueless what might be causing this random behavior, specially the eigen3 direct solver :-/
 lambday	err a mistake
-!- pickle27 [~Kevin@199.119.128.114] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lambday, could you valgrind it please?
 lambday	sonney2k: yeah already did
@sonney2k	lambday, maybe there is some uninited memory involved
 lambday	sonney2k: no errors
@sonney2k	lambday, and?
@sonney2k	hmmhh
 lambday	sonney2k: anyway, this one will do as of now
 lambday	ah, found the mistake
 lambday	anyway, this test will do fine
 lambday	setting direct value won't harm
 lambday	sonney2k: could you please merge if travis passes?

@sonney2k	lambday, what was it?
 lambday	sonney2k: my mistake! I mapped a SGVector to eigen3 first and then assigned that to a different vector
@sonney2k	wiking, examples/undocumented/python_modular/kernel_anova_modular.py  and classifier_multiclass_ecoc_random seem really broken
 lambday	and later using that map
 lambday	I wonder why it passed at all!
 lambday	for few cases that is :|
@sonney2k	lambday, lucky!
@wiking	sonney2k: yes indeed
 lambday	sonney2k: its badluck to be this lucky! tragically osx had to catch it not linux :|
@wiking	sonney2k: anova has various issues
@wiking	sonney2k: like serialization
 lambday	sonney2k: I am going off... good night :)
 lambday	good night wiking :)
