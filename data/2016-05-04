 CaBa	if i wanted to run a model selection parameter grid search in parallel, does it still make sense to use the shogun data structures like ModelSelectionParameters? can i iterate through the different parameter combinations from within python using those data structures?

 CaBa	in modelselection_parameter_tree_modular.py... there is a commented out section at the bottom that iterates through the parameter combinations
 CaBa	it doesn't seem to work though
 CaBa	'AttributeError: 'modshogun.SGObject' object has no attribute 'print_tree''
 CaBa	in the c++ code of GridSearchModelSelection it looks like the underlying container holds a more generic pointer type that has to be casted every time? but that shouldn't matter in python i assume...
