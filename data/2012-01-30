 blackburn	sonne|work: around?
 blackburn	we've got many cache misses in distance and kernel calculation
 blackburn	it is bad to do d[i,j] and d[j,i] in the same time
 blackburn	matrix calculation I mean

 sonne|work	blackburn: agreed
 blackburn	I wrote too much to understand what is you agree with :)
 sonne|work	it is bad to do d[i,j] and d[j,i] in the same time
 blackburn	ah yes
 sonne|work	did you write more than that?
 blackburn	well yes, for last two days
 blackburn	;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can hardly wait to release
 blackburn	cause I can't post on mloss and submit paper
 blackburn	blocks me a little
 sonne|work	heikos stuff needs testing before we can
 sonne|work	then do a snapshot
 blackburn	of current version?
 blackburn	how&
 sonne|work	IIRC make release SNAPSHOT=yes
 blackburn	hmm makes sense
 blackburn	sonne|work: have you seen I did integrate covertree?
 blackburn	I know you probably not a big fan of std things but it works smooth, that's definitely better than nothing
 sonne|work	no havent seen it
 sonne|work	no time now
 blackburn	sonne|work: well then you know it now :)
 sonne|work	where is it?
 blackburn	shogun/lib/CoverTree.h
 sonne|work	:)

@sonney2k	blackburn, what should index_t be?
 blackburn	sonney2k: unsigned?
@sonney2k	well possible if you are carefull with signedness everywhere
@sonney2k	would probably be a big change
 blackburn	I think we should -> to unsigned some day
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know whether gsoc got announced already?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not yet
@sonney2k	then things like for int i=0 i< size ; ... won't work
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	we would have to go through all loops and convert them to for index_t i=0 ...
 blackburn	hmm yes, but not a big change
@sonney2k	some of these are doing plus minus operations like
 blackburn	can be done gradually
@sonney2k	i-j
@sonney2k	and check if things are >0
@sonney2k	can be done but lot of work
 blackburn	sonney2k: it leaves room for optimization I think, i.e. when compiler knows i is unsigned
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	what does it help?
 blackburn	I'm not sure though
 blackburn	don't you think it would be better for compiler
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	underneath (machine language) signed / unsigned is no difference
 blackburn	well, for example loop to zero is faster
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	same thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not sure, zero test could be faster :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen my benchmark vs scikits?
@sonney2k	unsigned int u=0 ====== int u=0 :-)
 blackburn	final one
@sonney2k	all bits 0
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	you could check if you want
@sonney2k	where?
 blackburn	in the dropbox paper
 blackburn	folder
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	in the dropbox folder
 blackburn	now with fruits^W error bars
