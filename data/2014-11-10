 USC	Hello All
 USC	hey wiking, are you here?
 USC	I'm trying to run shogun on Visual Studio 2013

@wiking	USC: mmmm compiling shogun with visual studio will take some significant amount of time to fix some code
 USC	wiking: Which is the easiest way to use shogun?
@wiking	linux
@wiking	or docker
 USC	Docker made my computer internet connection unstable, sometimes I lost wireless connection and couldn't connect back, I had to restart my computer, so I uninstalled it,
 USC	which is better VMVARE linux on windows or Docker?
 USC	I couldn't even copy paste command into Docker
 USC	I had to write them all again and again
 USC	is it the same with VMWare Linux?
 USC	And which linux should I use?
 USC	wiking: ?
 USC	wiking: Are you there? I'm waiting for your answer..

 USC	hello wiking
 USC	I'm installing vmware + ubuntu 12.04 to run shogun
 USC	will you help me?
 USC	installation finished
 USC	my data file is an Excel file
 USC	how can I run shogun under Ubuntu 12.04
 USC	?
 USC	anybody alive here?
 USC	I need help
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	why 12.04?
@wiking	14.04
@wiking	is LTS
@wiking	well excel file we dont support but you could use a csv
 USC	wiking: glad you're here
 USC	I couldn't find the lastest image for vmware
 USC	do you have a link for that?
@wiking	mmm u could install it from scratch
 USC	will shogun work with 12.04?
@wiking	should
@wiking	but that's a way outdated ubuntu
@wiking	hence some of the cutting edge feature of shogun might not work
@wiking	so i really see no point why dont u use 14.04
@wiking	just download the iso
@wiking	and boot from that and install it
@wiking	and since you already have boot2docker
@wiking	you possibly have virtualbox
@wiking	so you could use that already
 USC	but now I'm using vmware
@wiking	don't need for vmware
@wiking	but yeah you use whatever fits your needs better
 USC	I don't understand the docker,
@wiking	i'm just saying that if i were u i would use 14.04
 USC	it is just a command line like cmd in windows
 USC	I tried cgywin also
 USC	make -f makefile didn't work on cygwin
 USC	anyway
 USC	how will I run shogun under linux ubuntu?
 USC	I have downloaded the shogun toolbox under Documents
@wiking	usc there's a lot of manual/help about this in the documentation
 USC	come on, please help me about this
@wiking	USC: ?
 USC	it has been a week, and I couldn't figure it out how to run shogun
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	well maybe that says something or?
 USC	that?
 USC	or?
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
@wiking	this is a very good explanation
@wiking	but i would suggest using the latest version of shogun
@wiking	and not 3.1.1
@wiking	i.e. checkout the git repository
 USC	ok
 USC	I downloaded the latest version
 USC	how will I open bash command screen on linux
 USC	where is it
 USC	?
 USC	wiking: ?

@wiking	aabout
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	marc
@wiking	HeikoS: VALS
@wiking	semester of code
@HeikoS	wiking: ah yeah
@HeikoS	good
@HeikoS	wiking: deadline is today right?
@wiking	nah
@wiking	3 more days
@HeikoS	fernando was super motivated to do this
@HeikoS	wiking: we mostly need task descriptions right?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: heya
@HeikoS	wanted to do a few these days
@wiking	yeah i mean the whole thing is super flexible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: heya
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: need your advice ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking shall we try to do a stammtisch tonight?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: shoot!
@wiking	hehehe i have the interview with http://www.thedataincubator.com/ tonight
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: anything GP related for a bachelor student
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome!
@HeikoS	wiking: fingers crossed!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: details please
@lisitsyn	yeah lets go wiking :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: some research topic
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i've got super sick... fucking a/c kills me in singapore
@wiking	although it's 35 degree celsius atm
@HeikoS	wiking: aaah. hate ac too
@wiking	so helooooo bitches :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: need any problem that could be solved with a thesis :D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: is this shogun related?
@wiking	it never goes below 25 :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes possibly
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I have an idea
@lisitsyn	I can force student to write shogun code
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: there is this work by andrew wilson
@HeikoS	on spectral mixture kernels
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that is a nice gsoc project
@HeikoS	but maybe its interesting for your student
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well we can force it before
@HeikoS	the idea is to take fourier transoform of kernel, then put a gaussian mixture on the frequency coefficients, and then learn the parameters like this
@lisitsyn	if someone takes that he would start in december
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this gives a very flexibly family of kernel functions which is easy to learn
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  in some sense similar to a multiple kernel learning regression, but way easier
@lisitsyn	what do you mean by fourier of kernel?
@HeikoS	works with GP framework
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: write it in frequency space, see bochners theorem
@wiking	(t) -> (omega)
@wiking	;)
@lisitsyn	hmm no I mean I am confused with that because we usually transform a vector
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	http://techtalks.tv/talks/gaussian-process-kernels-for-pattern-discovery-and-extrapolation/58204/
@lisitsyn	cool
@lisitsyn	thanks
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Definition
@HeikoS	http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~andrewgw/manet.pdf
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: see section 2
@lisitsyn	wiking: want to kill me with math? :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you want to look up bochers theorem
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheh it's a very simple integral
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no thats easy
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: idea is that you represent the kernel in frequency space and learn parameters there
@wiking	even a horse can do that ft
@lisitsyn	hmm yeah I've got
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: which seems a bit easier since one doesnt have to decide on a parametric form
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: they apply this to image inpainting
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: but you've got to choose the kernel still?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but one can use this spectral mixture kernels to do say regression
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the spectral mixture kernel is the kernel
@HeikoS	just need to learn gaussian mixture components
@lisitsyn	ahh so the trick is that we learn the kernel
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: which can be done via marginal likelihood optimisation
@lisitsyn	GMM of fourier coefficients?
@HeikoS	i.e. bfgs or gradient decent
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@wiking	hehe that's a funny idea
@lisitsyn	that's pretty vague for me but sounds cool
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the main question is
@lisitsyn	how can one do something about that that is 'defendable' :D
@lisitsyn	I mean they already have this method - what can I suggest to do about it?
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@195.101.111.125] has joined #shogun
@wiking	lisitsyn: it's a BSc
@wiking	he just have to do a review of it
@wiking	i reckon
@lisitsyn	hmm well
@wiking	and maybe apply to a dataset
@lisitsyn	yeah but I am like responsible
@wiking	that hasn't been evaluated yet
@wiking	he doesn't have to come up with something novel
@wiking	it's not going to be published in a journal or? :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: well I can also have masters student :D
@wiking	same applies
@wiking	never heard of some project
@wiking	i mean msc project has to be something totally novel
@lisitsyn	not totally novel
@wiking	i mean it wouldn't even be feasible
@wiking	i really reckon
@wiking	something like
@wiking	optimization
@lisitsyn	I just don't know what are points of extension here
@wiking	implementing it within a framework
@wiking	using some interesting datasets
@wiking	that sort of things are fine enough for a BSc/MSc thingy
@lisitsyn	yeah I will give him interesting datasets :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking this is quite nice for extrapolation
@lisitsyn	terabytes of interesting datasets
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	so maybe a dataset where one needs to extrapolate
@HeikoS	image inpainting
@lisitsyn	I have a few
@lisitsyn	actually
@HeikoS	regression for prediction of future
@HeikoS	etc
@lisitsyn	cool
@lisitsyn	okay I'll suggest that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: check out the GP book
@HeikoS	there is this co2 example in there
@HeikoS	in the book, they manually come up with a combination of 5 kernels
@HeikoS	then learn the parameters of the combination
@HeikoS	with the spectral mixture, its only learning parameters of one kernel
@lisitsyn	that's cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: for shogun, all to do is to implement 1 more kernel, then plug into existing framework
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it possible to make it scale?
@HeikoS	and then notebook
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: if your input space lies on a grid, then one can speed this up quite a bit
@HeikoS	like images
@HeikoS	see paper
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's grid but not image?
@lisitsyn	can I treat some user behaviour wrt time as grid
@lisitsyn	?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it always depends on whether the arguments to the kernel are on a grid
@HeikoS	so depends on your feature space
@HeikoS	but I guess not
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well time is like per second
@lisitsyn	isn't it grid?

 USC	why is this that complicated
@wiking	apt-get install it
@wiking	USC: i reckon this is rather easy
@HeikoS	wiking: what about removing the precise build?
@HeikoS	wiking: oh and could we add opencv to the nightly build or something?
@wiking	HeikoS: it's there
@wiking	opencv
@wiking	just the version is not good
@wiking	but not much i can do about that atm
@HeikoS	wiking: really, ah sorry then, which build?
@wiking	don't want to install something from src
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah agreed
@wiking	and i couldn't find a newer deb package
@HeikoS	wiking: just wanted to have kislays tutorial be part of the continuous testing
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm i reckon maybe we could use the trusty bot for that
@wiking	i'll check the version of opencv in ubuntu trusty
@HeikoS	I mean we dont need that on travis, as its unlikely to break, but still would be good
 USC	wiking: how will I download a compiler and the g++
@HeikoS	if you do it, could you send me an email?

@HeikoS	USC: google the question
@HeikoS	USC: thats very standard

@wiking	USC: yeah that's a rather easy setup

@wiking	USC: i mean can i ask you why would you like to use shogun, for what purpose?
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm yeah it's 2.4 so i reckn that a good version for the opencv integration

@wiking	USC: ?
@wiking	USC: this is not a wishlist channel
@wiking	that's like on amazon.com
@wiking	USC: i'm sorry man but this is not linux support channel... if you happen to have problems with linux itself, maybe join #linux channel

@wiking	regarding who's doing some shit wrong
@wiking	but i can give a quickfix

@wiking	the whole python modular will just work fine
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@HeikoS	wiking: so thats all from you
@HeikoS	wiking: what about osx?
@HeikoS	wiking: me and fernando need to write blogpost, but that can be done while releasing

@wiking	you can add 2

@HeikoS	wiking: and how will this nightly thing work? will some build upload a package? or does launchpad have their own distribution
@HeikoS	wiking: you are right :)
@wiking	well that's the thing
@wiking	i was working on generating the package itself
@wiking	but then it came out that ppa just needs the rule files + src targz-ed
@wiking	and ubuntu's build system will create the packages itself

 USC	I just want to say something to you guys
 USC	KILL shogun
 USC	BEAT shogun to death
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot force build "nightly_default"
@HeikoS	gentle
 USC	yeah HeikoS, I want to kill shogun gently
@lisitsyn	sounds good
@HeikoS	USC: thats what we are trying to do for some time now, but the beast just wont die
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot, force build "nightly_default"
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@lisitsyn	USC: would you kill it by your stupidity or you prefer any other way?
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot, force shogun "must die"
 shogun-buildbot	try 'force build [--branch=BRANCH] [--revision=REVISION] [--props=PROP1=VAL1,PROP2=VAL2...]  <WHICH> <REASON>'
 USC	lisitsyn: I'm not stupid, but the team behind shogun..
@lisitsyn	USC: prove it ;)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	awesome
 USC	knowing how to use linux doesn't mean smart, if it is not smart, it is stupid
@lisitsyn	yeah sure we are just monkeys that learnt how to use linux
@lisitsyn	but your proof has some flaws yet
@HeikoS	USC: sorry for redirecting you, the thing is that we have way too much work than time, so if we can we tell people to read the docs as it saves us time to help with shogun questions
@wiking	USC: i seriously reckon you should reiterate your thoughts before writing them down...
@wiking	if u came here to insult people then please leave
 USC	if you were smart enough, you would be able to create a software not a bunch of files
 USC	lisitsyn: start it, read the chat above
@wiking	all of us works hard on this project for years... in our spare time
@lisitsyn	so you imply that any cmake based software is just a bunch of files :D
 USC	wiking: lisitsyn started this converstation, he has to apologize
@wiking	and you coming it here and start insulting people is not the most decent things to say
@lisitsyn	I have to what? :D
@wiking	USC: are you like 8?
 USC	no I'm just 4, will be 5 in 4 months
@wiking	i mean dont get wme wrong it would be awesome
@wiking	if you'd be 8 and want to use shogun
@wiking	:D
@wiking	but i seriously doubt that
@lisitsyn	yeah absolutely
@lisitsyn	you would be younger than shogun itself
@lisitsyn	:D
 USC	how old are you wiking ?
@wiking	33
@wiking	about to be
 USC	when I become 8, you will be still trying to develop shogun,
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	ok so let's make something clear
@wiking	have u came here to troll?
 USC	no
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then please stop

 USC	I just want to say that you need be respectful to the people who're trying to use shogun, you can't call them stupid
 USC	I have never seen ubuntu or cgywin or others before
@HeikoS	USC: actio re-actio, lets drop the subject and talk about constructive things
@lisitsyn	hah so you want to turn it like we just insult you for nothing
@HeikoS	USC: that is fine, as I said, we are happy to help you, but we cannot help you with basic linux questions, there are other places for this
 USC	do you see lisitsyn? he is not happy
@wiking	usc fyi there are other fine machine learning libraries you could use on your machine
@wiking	nobody is forcing you to use shogun
@lisitsyn	stop playing victim you started this thing on kill shogun :D

@lisitsyn	I had enough vodka today to answer this :D
@wiking	i reckon we had the most action here ever since august :D
 USC	it was just a joke, vodka is killing your brain if you have it already
@wiking	USC: pleaase try to avoid going into personal things and just stick to the questions of shogun.. thnx heaps
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	gotta go, cu guys
@wiking	cya
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn
@HeikoS	stammtisch?
@HeikoS	tonight?
@HeikoS	can you make this?
 USC	can I ask a question about shogun project?
@lisitsyn	doesn't work for me it seems
@lisitsyn	USC: absolutely :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok, wiking?
@wiking	HeikoS: not me... its way to late
@wiking	i'm GMT+8
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, whats the last time you can justify
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	we should get those meetings going again
@wiking	well 1am here.. which is 6pm there
@wiking	6pm CET
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	i.e. 5pm GMT
@HeikoS	I will be back at 6 then
@lisitsyn	it would work for me but not today it seems
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	5
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah it's way to early
@wiking	but tooday i told you
@wiking	that i'm having
@wiking	the dataincubator thing
@wiking	so i'm like nogo
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn ok I will just do the meeting on my own, and then pretend it was full so people will com enext time ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I see,
@lisitsyn	hahah
@HeikoS	good luck with that
@HeikoS	well ok, see you later

 USC	can I ask a question about shogun project?
 USC	who is behind it? who is the boss? is he paying you?
@wiking	it's an open source project that is being developed by volunteers
@lisitsyn	yeah so wiking wasn't not paid to answer your questions - that's why he was surprised by your demand
 USC	what about a referral system? like libsvm does?
@lisitsyn	??
@wiking	referral?
 USC	citing in academic articles
 USC	are you all academicians?
@wiking	some
 USC	wiking: http://imgur.com/3vbfSJC
 USC	can you please check this
 USC	wiking: is it okay?
@wiking	seems like
 USC	lastly, can you please tell me what do I do now :)
@lisitsyn	you can now do make install
@lisitsyn	and use shogun
 USC	I did "make install"
 USC	but how will I run it :)
@wiking	USC: could you please elaborate why you want to use shogun and for what
@wiking	please not that this is really not a machine learning toolbox for rookies
@lisitsyn	you've got to write a program that uses shogun
 USC	I want to use shogun's MKLRegression model for prediction
@lisitsyn	in any of languages we support
 USC	I have 23 dependent 1 independent variable,
@lisitsyn	why mkl?
 USC	because I tried libsvm with gaussian kernel, the result is not bad but not perfect
 USC	so I want to try multiple kernels to see hopefully better results
@lisitsyn	please note that shogun is not like libsvm (command line tool) but a library
@lisitsyn	you'd have to read your data create objects etc
@wiking	so you would need to implement the whole thing using one of the supported languages
@wiking	(c++, python, ruby, java etc)
@wiking	there's no ./mkl-train <data>
@wiking	USC: check out the examples
 USC	thank you very much

@wiking	"From an algorithmic point of view, the computational cost associated with the calcula- tion of any entry of a nxn covariance matrix using a path-sum is known to be O(n) on trees,"
@wiking	"The O(n) complexity is achieved for the most general situation; if J or G has symmetries, the complexity would be lower. Evaluating the complexity of the path-sum approach on a graph with an arbitrary topology remains an open problem. Since the method of path-sums arises from exact resummations on walk-sums, every problem that has a walk-sum interpretation is susceptible to these resummations and therefore admits a path-sum expression. Consequently, ev

@HeikoS	wiking: one sentence summary?
@wiking	awesomeness
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	cool will read soon
@wiking	was just published in jmlr
@wiking	i have contacts to the authors
@wiking	so if u want to collaborate with them
@wiking	let me know
@wiking	we for sure should put this into shogun
@wiking	;)
@wiking	maybe lisitsyn's bsc student?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah sounds good

 naywhayare	HeikoS: do you have that picture from the summit? :)
@wiking	"We show that the path-sum formulation formulation is valid for arbitrary partitions of the inverse covariance matrix"
@wiking	lisitsyn: so basically super nice algo for GP
@lisitsyn	wiking: some greek letters
@wiking	lisitsyn: whaaat :D
@wiking	bad encoding? :d
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah my decoder is broken
@lisitsyn	that one in my brain

 mrbelt	hey there, this noob has a question for you
 mrbelt	how would you use backwards elimination or forward selection inside cross-validation? i really can't find any examples out there
 mrbelt	i'm using the python modular interface, BTW
@iglesiasg	mrbelt: randomising the mechanism that chooses the order in which predicted variables are selected?
@iglesiasg	mrbelt: I have no experience on doing it though. Just a random idea :)
@HeikoS	naywhayare: yes I have it, will send an email
@HeikoS	naywhayare: email?
@HeikoS	wiking: hope it went well!
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah, its from calling hidding methods
@HeikoS	mrbelt: hi
@HeikoS	mrbelt: the person to ask would be lambday
@HeikoS	mrbelt: this is new stuff so no examples, BUT it should work
@HeikoS	mrbelt: we looked at this issues and I think solved it
@HeikoS	mrbelt: I guess you are talking about variable selection?
@HeikoS	mrbelt: details please (maybe mailing list might be good)

@iglesiasg	HeikoS: I am making set_const and another one visible to interfaces again to fix the notebooks. It is not a nice solution but it gets a bit problematic when we are dealing with public attributes that are SGVector since typemaps are not coming into play then
