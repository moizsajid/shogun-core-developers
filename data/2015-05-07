 sanuj	HeikoS, lisitsyn : Have you guys tried using shogun on Kaggle problems?
 sanuj	most of the tutorials for python on Kaggle are for Scikit learn
 sanuj	i noticed we have an empty shogun-kaggle github repo

 sanuj	I was thinking of using shogun-python for Kaggle problems, if that is feasible.
@HeikoS	sanuj: its planned :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: we wanted to have a GSoC project on a Kaggle pipeline for Shogun
@HeikoS	would be cool
@HeikoS	to do a set of classes that make it very easy to
@HeikoS	1.) load data
@HeikoS	2.) preprocess data
@HeikoS	3.) extract features
@HeikoS	4.) apply supervised learning alogs
@HeikoS	5.) allows to stack toether features and algorithms (bagging fore example) in an easy way
@HeikoS	6.) paramete rlearning
