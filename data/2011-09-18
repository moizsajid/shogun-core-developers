 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r828a0f4 / (11 files): Various structure improvements for DR preprocessors - http://git.io/xKcPyg
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r1f6bf22 / src/shogun/preprocessor/DimensionReductionPreprocessor.h : Added doc for detect_dim routine - http://git.io/sok0Vg
 blackburn	sonney2k: superlu is such a pain in ass!
@sonney2k	blackburn, :)
 blackburn	they have no doc
 blackburn	even less than we have
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to turn on debug prints?
@sonney2k	obj.io.set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG)
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw my parallelization have impact on high-dimensional data
 blackburn	yesterday I've played with images a little
 blackburn	and 2 threads makes it 2 times faster
@sonney2k	very good
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 shogun-buildbot	build #232 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/232
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I have managed to move the templated stuff from the .h to the .cpp files
 blackburn	sonney2k: and how it is?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I didn't really do any benchmarks - did you notice any speed diff?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah - I am not really sure if it will change anything in the swig wrapper
@sonney2k	I mean in the end it will only look at *.h files so it must be slightly faster
@sonney2k	but the generated wrapper should be as big as it used to be
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/templates.html#faq-35.15
@sonney2k	however, I think it is much more readable this way
@sonney2k	so I will continue this effort for other templated classes
@sonney2k	blackburn, just look at SimpleFeatures.h now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've been wondering if we can use some swig custom things
@sonney2k	really nice now :)
@sonney2k	swig custom?
 blackburn	I mean there are a lot of options
 blackburn	may be we can use some of them
@sonney2k	options for what?
 blackburn	don't know, to ignore unnecessary things, improve something
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think we can can currently only improve compile speed by making certain types configurable
@sonney2k	I mean we could have a flag ./configure --supported-data-types=int8,uint8,...,floatmax_t
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	and then it will only generate wrappers for the ones in this list
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	this way we could just create say 3 of these by default - it doesn't help overall though
@sonney2k	blackburn, the other thing that could help a lot is removing all the Array.h Array2.h Array3.h and replacing it with SGVector,SGMatrix, SGNDArray
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I really don't understand why to use ArrayX
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it is used - so we just need to transfer some of its functions (like resize support, get/set functions w/ error checks)
 blackburn	aha
@sonney2k	and then it can be replaced...
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh the pirate party got 9% of the votes in the Berlin elections
 blackburn	sonney2k: hehe
 blackburn	you have truly elections..
