 hushell	lisitsyn: How do we use the DirectorXXX classes?
 lisitsyn	hushell: what exactly?
 lisitsyn	they are like *some language* -> C++ -> *some language* bridge
 hushell	e.g. CDirectorStructuredModel
 hushell	can we reimplment this class in other languages?
 lisitsyn	hushell: yes we inherit from that class in e.g. python
 lisitsyn	and implement required member functions
 lisitsyn	they will be called inside other C++ code
 hushell	okay. I understand now. from inherit can be easily done
 hushell	Thanks lisitsyn!
 lisitsyn	hushell: we even have an example
 lisitsyn	undocumented/python_modular/graphical/so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py
 hushell	lisitsyn: This is really useful, they can use our solvers, and only need to implement application specific stuff
 lisitsyn	hushell: they are a bit slower though
 lisitsyn	so in multiple calls it could get really slow
 hushell	lisitsyn: I was wondering how people use the structured model for their own purpose
 hushell	lisitsyn: you mean this is Swig's problem
 lisitsyn	hushell: well no real additional overhead in swig
 lisitsyn	but we always get a penalty calling foreign interface
 hushell	That's true
 lisitsyn	hushell: swig makes it wrapped as it was just virtual function
 lisitsyn	so no problem here
 lisitsyn	but then we've got to call some Py* stuff
 lisitsyn	convert data etc
 lisitsyn	and then back
 hushell	I see, so this becomes a problem for all the Py interfaces?
 lisitsyn	hushell: well this is relevant for directors because they called a lot times
 lisitsyn	other things are not that frequently called
 hushell	yes, these directors will be called many times internally, but they are good for demos :)
 lisitsyn	hushell: yes indeed prototyping and demos
 hushell	lisitsyn: Thanks! I am trying to simplify the StructuredModel and remove model independent things
