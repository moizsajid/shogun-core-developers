@sonney2k	ok I lied - we have irclogs now http://shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/
@sonney2k	dvevre, ^^
@sonney2k	enjoy and now really good night

 dvevre	:)
 dvevre	and good night!
 sploving	good night
 serialhex	YAY irc logs!!!

 dave718	Anyone have an example of working python modular code for RealFileFeatures?  I've tried building the binary file by hand and adding the data to RealFileFeatures() without args but no luck.
 dave718	i.e. I've tried both (making the binary file, and building it up within python).

 Guest22040	Hello
 Guest22040	Is there anyone online who knows a bit of Shogun? ;)
-!- sploving [~sploving@210.77.26.83] has joined #shogun
 Guest22040	sploving: Hi. Do you have any experience with Shogun?
 josip	Guest22040: don't ask to ask - just ask. There might be people around that can help you
 sploving	Guest22040,  yeap.
 Guest22040	It is written that Parallelized Code and k-means algorithm are supported by Shogun. Do you know if I can use Shogun to process >6GB datasets and to parallelize the computation process?
 sploving	I am not a expert about it. I am familiar with the modular typemap
 josip	you need to fit >6GBs in memory
 josip	given that they're not sparse
 josip	if I'm not mistaken
 josip	you might also want to look at #hadoop if you have really massive datasets
 josip	well, it will start swapping out otherwise and it will probably make it much slower
 josip	but you should better wait until someone more knowledable comes
 josip	:)
 Guest22040	I know about the hadoop but looking for sth where I do not have to install the hdfs
 Guest22040	the dataset could be 4GB but could be also 6, 8, 20 GB
 josip	well, if you can fit it in memory it should work I think - but might be very slow if a lot of it is swapped out
 Guest22040	ok
 josip	try it on a small subset first
 Guest22040	what about the complexity
 Guest22040	Are clustering algorithms parallelized?
 josip	in general? K-means can be parallelized
 Guest22040	I know. Is it? :P
 Guest22040	in Shogun? Do you know maybe? ;)
 josip	http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/1521 not yet I guess
 josip	or rather not yet ~6 months ago
 Guest22040	ok
 Guest22040	thx
 josip	you should wait for sonney2k tho
-!- sploving [~sploving@210.77.26.83] has quit []
 josip	Guest22040: hadoop is to troublesome to install?
 Guest22040	no but do not have access to such cluster
 Guest22040	I assume no ;)
 josip	anyway http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~wkliao/Kmeans/index.html
 Guest22040	I haven't tries
 Guest22040	d
 josip	there's even a link to a CUDA implementation if you have an nvidia card

 blackburn	WTF
@sonney2k	blackburn, I heard my name?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ehh?
@sonney2k	WTF?
 blackburn	(08:10:05 PM) akshayb: blackburn chutiya hai
 blackburn	(08:10:48 PM) akshayb: maaf karna dvevre lode hai!
 blackburn	it's all about this :D
@bettyboo	strange
@sonney2k	blackburn, not a language you understand?
 blackburn	yeah ;)
 blackburn	even don't know what it is, hindu?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how it is going?
@sonney2k	blackburn, live is a mess ... was weeding in the garden (and everyone except myself is sick here).
 blackburn	sick? why? I heard it is warm in Deutschland
 blackburn	damn segfault!
@sonney2k	yes it is very nice weather... no idea why just now.
@sonney2k	but 40 C fever is no fun...
-!- dvevre [b49531e3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	40? I hope all there will recover fast and you will not sicken
 blackburn	sonney2k: now looks like ROC? ;) http://img808.imageshack.us/f/hehegd.png/
@sonney2k	blackburn, why are there so many steps in there?
@sonney2k	doesn't look correct to me (more like a overestimated ROC curve)
 blackburn	hm..
 blackburn	sonney2k: I randomly placed +1 where -1 was and vice versa
 blackburn	in labels
 blackburn	does it depend on this?
@sonney2k	in the predicted labels or the true ones?
 blackburn	in true ones
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would start with the following labels:
@sonney2k	-1 +1 for true ones
@sonney2k	and outputs +1 +1
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw it is LDA for modified label_train_twoclass.dat
@sonney2k	blackburn, just don't use any classifier at all for the test
@sonney2k	but only manually set labels
 blackburn	eh.. sonney2k, is it a good example?
 blackburn	in that case we have only one point
@sonney2k	it should be a diagonal line
 blackburn	oh, sorry, 2
@sonney2k	from 0,0 to 1,1
 blackburn	rgh! found bug
 blackburn	ROC [[ NaN   0.]
 blackburn	 [  1.   1.]]
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeap, it is
 blackburn	sonney2k: can ROC be lower than diagonal..?
 blackburn	i tested it on (true: -1 1 1) (predicted: 1 1 -1)
 blackburn	and the points are (0,0) (1,0.5) (1,1)
 josip	sonney2k: someone asked if there is a parallel implementation of k-means in Shogun. is it implemented as of now>?
 blackburn	found mistake
 blackburn	josip: iirc it uses distancemachine class which are parallel
 josip	so only the calculation of pairwise is distributed?
 josip	pairwise distance*
 josip	err parallel*
 blackburn	yeap
 josip	http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2476983
 blackburn	josip: seems cluster distance is parallel too, but we could better wait for answer of Soeren (cause he is author) :D
@sonney2k	josip, it is parallel but not memory efficient (computes distance matrix)
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you give me an another test for ROC? ;)
@sonney2k	true -1 +1 , pred. -1 +1 :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: 1 1 -1 both true and predicted gives ROC (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) and auROC 1.0
@sonney2k	and +1 -1 for pred :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: eh.. about last one
 blackburn	is it good that I have (0,0) (1,0) (1,1)?
 blackburn	auROC 0.0
 blackburn	it seems to be right, but don't know exactly
@sonney2k	me neither but at least auROC is ok

 blackburn	hm.. okay, will push it just after some doc
@sonney2k	blackburn, just compare it to the python script on some realistic data sets
 blackburn	sonney2k: can i trust it? you said it have bug
@sonney2k	the python one? it should be ok, just not when there are multiple outputs that are the same
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay
 blackburn	tested
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/67
 blackburn	ready for 'execution' ;)
 blackburn	*using axe or any other weapon
* sonney2k of course I will be using hattori hanzo manufactured swords if necessary
@sonney2k	as any shogun would.
 blackburn	oh so I will drink vodka
 blackburn	as any russian do :D

@mlsec	Sorry guys, but ROC is best evaluated using continuous scores
@mlsec	ROC is deeply rooted in signal processing
 blackburn	eh.. what you mean?
 blackburn	because there is no difference in evaluation algorithm when continuous or not
@mlsec	I was referring to: sonney2k: [20:30:10] true -1 +1 , pred. -1 +1 :)
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I tested it on 1.1, 1.2, -1.3, etc
 blackburn	the other reason why I made scores this way: mldata-utils ROC don't handle with equal scores
@mlsec	That's better.
@mlsec	The interesting part about ROC curves is the interpolation for continuous scores
@mlsec	Eg pessimistic, average and optimistic
 blackburn	ah. read some about that in fawcett's paper
@mlsec	Yes. Good one
@mlsec	Is there also a section averaging ROCs?
@mlsec	That's also not trivial
 blackburn	where 'there'? ;)
@mlsec	In the paper of Fawcett?
 blackburn	yeap, it has a section about it
@mlsec	I am keeping msg short, as I am writing from a smartphone
 blackburn	ok, just not understood where exactly, in class I made or in fawcett's paper
 blackburn	I wonder how you use irc on your smartphones :) it seems to be not so convenient
 blackburn	*Soeren did last week too
@mlsec	hehe. it's funny
@mlsec	Anyway. I had a lot of fun with writing ROC code (interpolation, AUC bounded at FP, averaging)
@mlsec	So I am looking forward to Shogun contributions
 blackburn	oh I had a lot of struggles doing simple ROC
 blackburn	made a pull request with it
 blackburn	now i'm doing some 'refactoring' at shogun.Evaluation
