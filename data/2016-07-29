@wiking	OXPHOS, wazzaaa
@wiking	OXPHOS, do we serialize?
 OXPHOS	wiking: I'm dockering!
@wiking	aaaah ok
@wiking	so you still have to resolve travis, right?
 OXPHOS	wiking: may i ask, what's the hash number pulling from shogun/dev? I can't find a match in shogun
 OXPHOS	yes
@wiking	docker pull shogun/shogun-dev
@wiking	this should pull you the image
 OXPHOS	yeah
 OXPHOS	wiking: can you explain more? how do I suppose to use it :)
@wiking	ah
@wiking	so once you've pull
@wiking	*ed
@wiking	then you do
@wiking	sudo docker run -it shogun/shogun-dev /bin/bash
@wiking	then you are inside the docker
 OXPHOS	wiking: I don't need all the latest right? the downloading is kinda slow
 OXPHOS	wiking: and it started all over today
@wiking	what do you mean latest?
@wiking	of?
@wiking	docker image?
@wiking	i mean there's like 2 version of it
@wiking	it has a lot of dependencies :)
 OXPHOS	ohh
 OXPHOS	I got Using default tag: latest latest: Pulling from shogun/shogun-dev
 OXPHOS	96c6a1f3c3b0: Downloading 40.01 MB/65.7 MB ed40d4bcb313: Download complete  b171f9dbc13b: Download complete
@wiking	yeah but it'll pull a lot of images
 OXPHOS	blabla..
@wiking	like the base image
@wiking	etc
 OXPHOS	it's gonna be tough
 OXPHOS	wiking: btw I can't remove or unlink string
@wiking	?
@wiking	?
@wiking	i'm not sure if i understand
@wiking	std::string a;
@wiking	a.c_str()
 OXPHOS	wiking: so the filename in serialization unittest. I'm not using char
@wiking	yeah and
@wiking	?
@wiking	std::string has api
@wiking	that returns the char* behind it
@wiking	.c_str()
 OXPHOS	okay i see
@wiking	please RTFM
@wiking	OXPHOS, here?
 OXPHOS	wiking: yep
@wiking	ok so this is not correct
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3375/files/28766e03e946c002f3796dfaf6f47d14c1f6b8c0..8a76421e1cbd81e2926dfadcf0d55c30860d8445#diff-1689b0bd3ceb28355cc3c05ed7ffe4f0R127
@wiking	you wanna expose the load/save_xml/json/binary to swig
@wiking	as you wanna be able to save/load from swig interfaces
@wiking	the only thing that you dont wanna expose to swig
@wiking	is the templated version
@wiking	of load/save
 OXPHOS	ohhh i see
 OXPHOS	thanks

@wiking	c4goldsw, y0
 c4goldsw	wiking hello
 c4goldsw	doing well?
@wiking	c4goldsw, you have introduced some memleaks: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20160728-0131.html
 c4goldsw	wiking Alright, I'll look into that then - I'll probably have questions in a few minutes
@wiking	kkk
 c4goldsw	wiking, is index_t signed or unsigned?
 c4goldsw	If you don't know I'll just test it quickly (I couldn't find where it's defined).
 c4goldsw	wiking Ah, it's int32_t
@wiking	i think yeah it's a typedef for int32_t
 c4goldsw	Now, here's a little problem I'm having.  Remember the errors I was getting from here: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/coverity%20analysis/builds/110/steps/analyse/logs/stdio
 c4goldsw	They're just being caused by lines like this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L203
 c4goldsw	Now, what should I do to resolve an error like this?  It seems a little silly to have to cast just to stop a warning, but that's the easiest solution I have in mind.
 c4goldsw	wiking ^
@wiking	 size_type Unsigned integral type (usually std::size_t)
@wiking	use the right type for the i
@wiking	so for example
@wiking	instead of for (index_t i=0; i < corr.size(); ++i)
@wiking	do for (size_t i=0; i < corr.size(); ++i)
@wiking	right?
 c4goldsw	Ok, thanks.  Next question: would you recommend Valgrind for finding the memleaks?
@wiking	yeah that's hat is being used there
 c4goldsw	Okee dokee.  Thanks for the help.
@wiking	nw
 c4goldsw	wiking Also, how can I get these warnings to show?  Is there some CMake option for that?
@wiking	well it pretty much depends on your compiler
@wiking	in that case i think clang is being used
@wiking	but you can specify
@wiking	like
@wiking	CXXFLAGS="-Werror" CFLAGS="-Werror" cmake ...
@wiking	and then do the make
@wiking	becuase in that case every warning will act as an error
 c4goldsw	Okay, thanks.

 c4goldsw	Hey HeikoS, how are you?
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: hey man
@HeikoS	yeah all good , and you?
 c4goldsw	Good good.  Where you on holiday?
@HeikoS	yeah last week
 c4goldsw	Cool.  Have a question about the clean up: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3313#discussion-diff-71969594R43
@HeikoS	sure will do
 c4goldsw	What's the exact issue, and what can I do about it (what I just linked), if anything?
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so we cannot have any method exposed to SWIG that have std:: in them
@HeikoS	so this needs to be hidden from SWIG
 c4goldsw	How do you hide it?
@HeikoS	which means it needs to be guarded with #ifndef HAVE_SWIG
@HeikoS	or similar, I always forget the exact name of macro
@HeikoS	see SGVector.h there is many such guards
 c4goldsw	Alright, I'll get onto that then.  That's all for now
@HeikoS	it just means swig ignores
@HeikoS	so it is as simple as adding 2 lines
@HeikoS	but maybe it already is, just wanted to make sure
 c4goldsw	#ifndef works
 c4goldsw	No, I don't think so.
 c4goldsw	nope
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.21.44] has joined #shogun
 c4goldsw	Hey HeikoS, what do SG_REF() and SG_UNREF() do?
@wiking	c4goldsw, ++ and -- the reference counter
@wiking	in case you do a CMachine* m = new CLeastAngleRegression(...);
@wiking	you'll have to do a SG_UNREF(m);
@wiking	on the end
@wiking	to release the memory
 c4goldsw	Makes sense.
 c4goldsw	Thanks wiking
@wiking	nw
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: around?
 c4goldsw	wiking Also, the leaks are being caused by test cases which are made to crash intentionally.  I'll get onto resolving that.
 c4goldsw	Cleanup currently isn't happening when they do crash.
@wiking	ah cool just make sure that it'll still happen :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeap
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you look away
 sanuj	now you are not away
 lisitsyn	just a few minutes here
 lisitsyn	sup
 sanuj	lisitsyn, plugins PR is good to be merged
 sanuj	just this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3370#discussion-diff-72779293R31
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	sanuj: could you please get rid of camel case there?
 lisitsyn	for some reason I used it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, for function names or class names?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: functions
 sanuj	lisitsyn, Khorosho
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I have two questions for you
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: 1. "view whole listing" in meta examples
@HeikoS	2.) how to get this integration testing working for SWIg targets
@HeikoS	i.e. templated array
 c4goldsw	ping wiking
@wiking	pong
 c4goldsw	wiking sorry for the delay. If I want to throw a general error, what should I throw?
 c4goldsw	Would throw; be sufficeint?  It's for the tests that are meant to crash, when I'm handling the actual error being thrown (it's for cleanup)
 c4goldsw	I just did a quick test and it appear to work.
 c4goldsw	appeared*

 c4goldsw	HeikoS the LARS cleanup patch is in.
 c4goldsw	Travis is building it.
 c4goldsw	I've also started work to make LDA support float types (I'll be following the exact same process as I did for LARS).
 c4goldsw	Also, how can I make a contribution to the news file?

 Saurabh7	c4goldsw: you can just make your addition to the NEWS file
 c4goldsw	Saurabh7 Cool, I'll do that then.  Also, do you have a moment?
 Saurabh7	sure
 c4goldsw	Great, it's a C++ syntax question.  Take this:https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/a29d0fe0415bdcff925619af942a0df9#file-lda-cpp-L201
 c4goldsw	I'm getting the error that Constant() isn't a method of EigenVectorXt.  The definition for that is here:
 c4goldsw	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/SGVector.h#L40
 c4goldsw	Do you know what this is happening?
 c4goldsw	The actual error is "no type named Constant" in EigenVectorXt
 c4goldsw	Saurabh7 I've found this:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19128796/why-can-i-call-base-template-class-method-from-derived-class, I think I should be fine
 c4goldsw	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19128796/why-can-i-call-base-template-class-method-from-derived-class
 Saurabh7	ah
 Saurabh7	yeah looks like its due to the templated eigen matrix
 Saurabh7	not sure how to solve that
 Saurabh7	setConst doesnt work too ?
