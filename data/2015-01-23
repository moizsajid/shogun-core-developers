 abinashmeher	can anyone help me with forking the wiki?
 sonne|work	abinashmeher: just git clone it
 abinashmeher	sonne|work : What I had done was fork the main repo and then submodule update --init
 abinashmeher	now whenever i go to wiki to fork I am getting the same main repo
 abinashmeher	My intent is to suggest some changes in the wiki which I am not able to do since after submodules update --init I am not able to find any remote of my fork in doc/md

 sonne|work	abinashmeher: git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.wiki.git
 abinashmeher	thanks let me try
 abinashmeher	sonne|work: I am getting this error https://gist.github.com/abinashmeher999/706116605eddb0b0bbce
 abinashmeher	abinash is a separate branch

 lambday	abinashmeher: I guess you need to clone your forked repo
 abinashmeher	lambday: I did but upon `git submodule update --init` the doc/md submodule was created, when I navigate to doc/md I dont see any remote for my fork
 abinashmeher	We are having the same discussion on the mailing list
 lambday	abinashmeher: did you try pushing it to your fork?
 lambday	abinashmeher: make changes locally, push it to your fork, create pull request - I guess it should work
 lambday	given that you cloned your fork
 abinashmeher	lambday: This is what I am getting https://gist.github.com/abinashmeher999/d7373567561722f6b7f4
 lambday	abinashmeher: do 'git remote show origin'
 lambday	paste the output
 abinashmeher	ok
 abinashmeher	lambday: here it is https://gist.github.com/abinashmeher999/2b80289ef5ad2f971ae8
 lambday	abinashmeher: ah, it's showing the shogun git one for submodule data... that's why
 abinashmeher	exactly
 abinashmeher	whats the solution?
 lambday	abinashmeher: I'd try updating the origin and upstream..
 abinashmeher	lambday: I am a bit new to git.. can you please explain how would you do it from yourside and how i would fork it
 lambday	abinashmeher: ah sorry I don't have my machine to try things out now (@work) ! maybe you can google a bit.
 abinashmeher	lambday: Cool.. Thanks for the help :)
 lambday	setting upstream is easy 'git remote set upstream' or so
 lambday	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432764/change-the-uri-url-for-a-remote-git-repository
 lambday	maybe this can help
 lambday	[or similar things]
 abinashmeher	but without my fork of the repo I cant set the origin
 abinashmeher	Thanks I am searching for it

 ephas	Hi, the examples on cross-validation show how to run CV and return just a single metric (e.g. accuracy).  I was wondering if it was possible to return more than one metric when running CV, e.g. accuracy, precision etc., without having to run the CV a second time for the other metrics?
 ephas	sorry, I should have added that I am using the Python interface.

@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	thats cool
@HeikoS	ephas: hi
@HeikoS	ephas: I dont think that is currently possible, right lisitsyn?
@HeikoS	ephas: I will put a feature issue on github, its easy to extend this and we got a horde of students looking for such easy tasks
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I don't remember exactly :D
@HeikoS	ephas: could you open an issue on github and put the description there? I will complete it
 ephas	HeikoS: thanks - I'll open an issue.  I think I have a work around for now but it would be great to have it as a feature!

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: have you seen my two PRs lately?
@lisitsyn	curious what you think
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: not yet
@HeikoS	but I will get there
@HeikoS	ephas: its super easy to put this in, so putting the issue makes it likely that we have it within a month or so :)

 jejjohnson	I tried using "sudo apt-get install shogun-python-modular" to install the shogun toolbox but apparently that package doesn't exist. I recently followed the instructions on github (https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/INSTALL) and believe I managed to install the require components. However, if I test the mod out using python (import modshogun as sg) I get an error saying that there is no module named modshogun. I was won
