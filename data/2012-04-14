 wiking	:P
 wiking	i'm gonna test this one
 blackburn	wiking: I still did not get how can that be you have no features for test data
 blackburn	what then you have at all
 wiking	well i do have
 wiking	let's say i have 2 different features about an image
 wiking	1 feature is based on the image
 wiking	2 feature is based on the text around the image
 blackburn	text around the image?
 wiking	most of the cases i have 1+2
 wiking	yes since the text is embedded into a text
 wiking	and the text is for sure not completely unrelated to the image... just in very few cases it is
 wiking	anyhow
 wiking	most the time i have 1+2 features
 wiking	but sometimes
 wiking	i only have feature 1
 wiking	as i don't have the 'context' of the iamge
 wiking	image
 wiking	just the image itself
 blackburn	I don't think it is DA however
 blackburn	wiking: DA is all about different distributions of test and train data
 wiking	well according the slide u've sent
 wiking	i've got that differently
 wiking	http://www.eatdifferent.com/tips/sugarydrinks#drink=coke suuuuugar
 blackburn	wiking: which slide?
 wiking	http://fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/lectures/talk-mtcompbio.pdf
 blackburn	wiking: yes, there is underlying assumption that target probability space is slightly different
 blackburn	wiking: I have seen one fantastic paper
 blackburn	they learned svm recognizing pedestrians on *game*
 blackburn	and used domain adaptation to construct real system
 wiking	:PP
 blackburn	that is the case
 blackburn	in your case I am unsure how can it help
 blackburn	I mean if you have no features it is a latent model :)
 wiking	well my space is slighhtly different
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	so latent DA? nice
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	nono
 wiking	i mean u didn't get it then
 wiking	so you get the 2 different features right?
 wiking	so i use that and train that SVM
 blackburn	on train data?
 wiking	a multiclass svm
 wiking	yes
 wiking	train data has both features
 wiking	features from image and features from text
 blackburn	and test has only text often?
 wiking	i mix them in a way
 wiking	no
 wiking	test has soometimes
 wiking	only image
 wiking	features
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	right
 wiking	so that's where i see DA could do the trick for me
 blackburn	how?
 wiking	well i train a classifier with the both of the features
 wiking	and then use that
 wiking	in DA where i only have 1 type of feat
 wiking	and yes i can make it both having train/test split for 1 type of features
 blackburn	you didn't convince me :D
 blackburn	wiking: I still think that you should rather do some kernel mean matching or so
 wiking	seems java as a language itself is going to be copyrighted :O
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 wiking	"With the Oracle v. Google trial date set for next Monday, the Judge has asked Google and Oracle to take a position on whether a programming language is copyrightable."
 blackburn	oh i hate oracle
 blackburn	their databases are powerful crap heh
 blackburn	and their intentions are totally evil

 wiking	worry why?
 wiking	it's just great that somebody wants to do it as gsoc
 blackburn1	huh! there are some more
 blackburn1	worry because he kinda competes with me
 wiking	competes?
 wiking	why, i thought that this is a team work
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn1	for slot
 wiking	ah u want to do gsoc as well this year?
 wiking	i didn't know
 blackburn1	surprise :D
 wiking	:))))
 wiking	ahaaaaaa
 wiking	i thought you are mentoring this year
 blackburn1	no, I am not an expert in anything :)

 blackburn1	wiking: what is the problem with pgm?
 wiking	blackburn1: nada... found out what was the problem... in the header i've got some comments but managed to remove them
 wiking	but we have a problem with the new merge
 blackburn1	yes but it may be related to order of commits
 blackburn1	let us wait a little
 wiking	ah
 blackburn1	wiking: do you read pgm manually?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	fscanf failed
 wiking	;)
 wiking	for reading the header
 blackburn1	wiking: what do you use then?
 wiking	i thought it's always 4 integers are coming in a given order
 wiking	so i did an fscanf on the header of the pgm
 wiking	but then some images that i used to convert with imagemagic
 wiking	had some comments in them
 wiking	from exif or i have no idea from
 wiking	where
 shogun-buildbot	build #675 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/675

 blackburn1	I mean python's imload have no problem with comments
 wiking	hehehe i have my own utility ... it's a pretty lame feature extractor
 wiking	but still i want to see how it works
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i saw new io classes
 wiking	well anyhow i have to get back somehow to be able to feed gmm with my custom created gmms... so i can start clustering
 wiking	damn my shell script is stupid should do something better about it

 wiking	lol i've just read about new way of stealing a car: they put on your parking car of the rear window in the middle a paper, so when you sit in your car and you start the engine and start to get out from the parking slot you'll realize that there's a car at the rear window, you get out (of course leave everything in the car and the engine running) to remove the paper and at this moment somebody will jump into your car and run away with your car and all yo

 wiking	anything
 wiking	a piece of paper in the middle of the rear window
 wiking	just that you get distracted
 blackburn1	I see
 wiking	so that you'd get out from the car to remove it

 n4nd0	I think I have it on the tip of my tongue
 n4nd0	blackburn1: no way, I don't remember :(
 gsomix	n4nd0, hi. how are you?
 n4nd0	gsomix: hey! I am fine, what about you?
 gsomix	n4nd0, I'm lazy, hehe. what about covertree?
 n4nd0	gsomix: it's going good :)
 n4nd0	I hope I will have something ready to push during this weekend
 gsomix	cool!
 n4nd0	gsomix: what about you, what are you working on?
 gsomix	n4nd0, reference counting for SGVector. but I had some problems with time over the past days.
 n4nd0	gsomix: aham, good luck with it anyway ;)
 blackburn1	n4nd0: ah consider merging your ovo thing
 n4nd0	blackburn1: yeah, but first I should test if it now it works fine
 n4nd0	blackburn1: don't you think so?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: why couldn't it work?

 blackburn1	n4nd0: I guess that is I promised to do
 blackburn1	karlnapf: what is your next weeks workload?
 karlnapf	blackburn1, I just handed in my last coursework, so I will have a bit more time. However, there are still the exams in May, which are really important and therefore currently have priority
 blackburn1	karlnapf: I stumbled upon maximum mean discrepancy embedding and will ask you for some advice later :)
 karlnapf	but I think I will be able to do some shogun stuff in between
 karlnapf	really? where?
 karlnapf	This is really cool stuff (-)
 karlnapf	8-)
 blackburn1	karlnapf: MMD or MMDE?
 blackburn1	I assume you are MMD expert
 blackburn1	MMDE is some kind of multitask stuff
 karlnapf	maximum mean discrepancy embedding?
 karlnapf	never heard it, what happens there
 blackburn1	karlnapf: LLE(MVU) + MMD
 karlnapf	LLE(MVU)?
 blackburn1	Locally Linear Embedding
 blackburn1	okay idea is to use MMD as distance if I get it right
 blackburn1	and construct embedding
 karlnapf	MMD is a distance between distributions
 blackburn1	as latent space for united features space for domain
 blackburn1	karlnapf: can't it be empirical?
 karlnapf	yes, of course, you dont know the distributions
 karlnapf	ok, sounds cool, do you have a paper?
 blackburn1	https://home.cse.ust.hk/~jamesk/papers/aaai08.pdf
 karlnapf	looks interesting
 karlnapf	cool I am always looking for applciations of MMD
 karlnapf	the stuff I am doing will be kind of a large scale online two sample test, so a bit more statistics than ML
 blackburn1	I see
 blackburn1	so how can you apply it?
 karlnapf	what do you mean?
 karlnapf	like which applications?
 blackburn1	karlnapf: yes
 karlnapf	the current MMD test ist in quadratic time. However, imagine you have infinite data and want the best test possible for a given amount of time
 karlnapf	then you do a kind of online-like kernel selection on a stream of data
 blackburn1	aha
 karlnapf	either you optimise kernel until test says distributions are different
 blackburn1	but which distributions do you compare?
 karlnapf	or until you can say, probably they are equal
 karlnapf	data comes from two distributions
 karlnapf	goal is a two sample test
 karlnapf	like:
 karlnapf	two sources of microarray data
 karlnapf	test is cancer type is equal or not
 karlnapf	Ill tell you more about it later :)
 karlnapf	currently in the early stages
 karlnapf	oh and thats my master project
 karlnapf	the gsoc stuff is a bot different
 karlnapf	but anyway, I will study a bit now :) see you around!
 blackburn1	ok looks clearer now
 blackburn1	thanks for explanation :)
 blackburn1	see you

@sonney2k	gsomix, hey - how is it going?
 gsomix	sonney2k, moin. I added code to ref count in the SGVector. and I did SGVector -> SGVector& for arguments to some functions and methods.
 gsomix	but I have a question. can you look at code preprocessors?
 gsomix	methods `apply_to_feature_vector'
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	and?
 gsomix	sonney2k, this method should return a reference to new SGVector on heap with SG_REF, isn't it?
 gsomix	or should leave as is?
@sonney2k	gsomix, uh you are right
@sonney2k	I am not sure if this reference (on the heap) is still valid after the function returns
 blackburn	hey there
 gsomix	blackburn, yo
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to ask you to review feature learning code
 blackburn	would be pretty unfair :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: and btw I merged lars
 wiking	i have only a mean vector and the variance vector of a gaussian... how do i create a CGaussian from that? :)
-!- Marty28 [~Marty@158.181.78.199] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	wiking: what is the problem?
 wiking	well the covariance is a matrix...
 wiking	CGaussian(SGVector<float64_t> mean, SGMatrix<float64_t> cov, ECovType cov_type=FULL);
 blackburn	use DIAG or so
 blackburn	or patch it :D
 wiking	you mean that in case of a DIAG matrix where the diag elements are actually the variance that should be fine for creating a gaussian?
 blackburn	wiking: yes some kind of
 blackburn	3 0 0
 blackburn	0 1 0
 blackburn	0 0 3
 blackburn	would work :)
 wiking	and 3,1,3 would be the variance?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	mmm is there a function to create a diag matrix where with given diagonal elements, i.e. from a vector?
 gsomix	sonney2k, why not? or do you mean that problem is that someone should to free returned SGVector?
 blackburn	wiking: where?
 wiking	or simply create an eye matrix
 wiking	mmm in shogun
 blackburn	what is the inteface?
@sonney2k	gsomix, because the on the heap allocated object might be freed already...
 wiking	i'm asking whether there is one :)
 blackburn	wiking: there is one in cmath (create_diagonal_matrix) however if you use python it would be easier to use numpy for that
 wiking	so like diag (v) in matlab
 gsomix	sonney2k, so what is strategy to convert method's returns (SGVector)? references only in the right places?
 gsomix	we can not return references to local variables or references to allocated SGVector in methods. should we return copy?
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. I figured out how it should work. :)

 wiking	so this is my code
 wiking	the getKernel function is just giving me the kernel i want
 wiking	ahahahahhahahah
 blackburn	I bet it is empty
 wiking	i have 10 bucks that it's my fault
 wiking	i've commented out the kernel.init ... part
 blackburn	nice
 wiking	hehe now it works of course
 wiking	jesus
 wiking	lets see if i'm getting the same error
 wiking	i mean

 blackburn	some kind of CHI2 + intersection?
 wiking	just do the mapping for the given features
 wiking	yes
 wiking	so you take the features
 wiking	and then do the homo mapping
 wiking	the desired kernel for the given feature
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@109.169.156.156] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 wiking	and then just concatenate those features
 blackburn	okay actually I think this should be done with some features union helper
 wiking	hehe yeah
 wiking	well i have my own function for it at the moment
 blackburn	I'll implement one in a hr
 wiking	but i guess what we would like to have is in shogun
 wiking	but there's something like this no?
 wiking	sonney2k: was talking about
 wiking	the CombinedDotFeatures
 blackburn	hmm actually yes
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	it makes more sense even
 blackburn	no need to do that
-!- genix is now known as gsomix
 wiking	i'll give it a shot now
 wiking	see how it'll react

 CIA-64	shogun: added mkl modelselection example - http://git.io/-Ob1_g
 wiking	karlnapf: the model selection example works?
 karlnapf	wiking, no, not yet
 karlnapf	segfault
 karlnapf	some strange stuff
 blackburn	long way :)
 karlnapf	Luckily I could tell this guy from cambridge how to use an alternative
 karlnapf	(not using SVMLight)
 blackburn	which guy?
 wiking	karlnapf: i'm just trying to experiment with mkl
 karlnapf	he wrote on the mailing list a couple of times about mkl stuff
 wiking	but i'm always getting worse results than simply doing a combinedfeatures/kernel
 karlnapf	wiking, what are you trying to do?
 blackburn	ah
 wiking	+ gmnpsvm
 karlnapf	I mean for simple examples, MKL should be a bit worse than standard stuff since when optimising, there are a lot of approximations happening.
 karlnapf	but I am not an MKL expert, soeren is
 blackburn	soeren hates it
 wiking	hahahahah
 karlnapf	really?
 karlnapf	lol
 wiking	yeah soeren dislikes it ;)
 karlnapf	why did he write so many papers then ;)
 wiking	good question D:
 blackburn	just for fun may be :D
 karlnapf	wiking, is the result much worse?
 wiking	karlnapf: well we are talking about 7-8% accuracy
 wiking	so 80 vs 87-88
 wiking	$
 wiking	%
 karlnapf	for binary classification?
 karlnapf	oh
 karlnapf	mmh thats a lot
 wiking	multi class sorry
 wiking	yeah i thought it should be actually better
 wiking	but it's not :(
 karlnapf	mmh, dont know, there are so many possible sources for that
 karlnapf	why?
 karlnapf	MKL is usually not better than just trying combinations by hand
 karlnapf	only faster
 wiking	mmm not faster either ;)
 karlnapf	hehe ;)
 karlnapf	Well to be honest, I dont know, havent digged into that stuff.
 blackburn	karlnapf: ah one more issue
 karlnapf	I am currently more interested to get rid of memory bugs in MKL with SVMLight :)
 karlnapf	this is ugly
 blackburn	I'd like to enable cross validation for dim reduction things :)
 karlnapf	people want to use model-selection and it doesnt work
 blackburn	I'll ask you later
 karlnapf	blackburn, yes nice
 karlnapf	I guess you would want to modify/add stuff on the ModelSelection class
 karlnapf	Currently, a CMachine interface is needed
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.173.199] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 blackburn	karlnapf: yeah however that would be really painful change
 karlnapf	blackburn, I think it would be better to extend the modelselection class
 karlnapf	however, you would need some shared interface between all classes that do want to do some parameter selection
 blackburn	karlnapf: oh I feel too much pain thinking about it :D
 wiking	what's with svm/ScatterSVM.h ?
 blackburn	wiking: LOLZ
 karlnapf	lol ;)
 wiking	what's that thing? :)))
 wiking	with being experimental :D
 blackburn	you're really going to try EACH feature of shogun
 wiking	i'm just checking the svm machines
 wiking	and i've just stumbled upon that stuff :))
 blackburn	wiking: okay actually it is experimental and definitely not better than larank/gmnp
 wiking	ahhaha
 blackburn	wiking: I really believe you should address your issues not with trying different machines ;)
 wiking	:D
 wiking	wtf?
 blackburn	wiking: I mean your accuracy problem could be solved by analysis of results
 wiking	once again
 wiking	wtf?
 karlnapf	blackburn, I am thinking of moving the subset logic (stack etc) from Features/Labels to Subset class. However, that would break all objects that have a subset from older shogun version (migration can do nothing here)
 blackburn	karlnapf: do you understand my words? :)
 karlnapf	what do you think?
 blackburn	karlnapf: why?
 karlnapf	blackburn, because then the logic would be in one class
 karlnapf	instead of having it multiple times in different classes
 karlnapf	Before these stacks, everythig was easy

-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.181.141] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	but now code gets more complicated and you dont want to have a similar copy of the recomputation of the subset stack in every class which uses it
 blackburn	I can hardly imagine that logic in stacks though
 karlnapf	its a pain anyway because normally this should be done via multiple inheritance, but we cannot use this, so each class has to implement wrapper classes anyway
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.173.199] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	just the methods add/remove
 blackburn	I think Soeren would not like breaking migrations
 karlnapf	the current active subset has to be recomputed in it
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	this stuff is all not migratable anyway
 karlnapf	i dont know how to translate the current changes .....
 blackburn	actually my opinion is that users can do migrations manually :)
 karlnapf	in this case, i agree
 karlnapf	in other cases, we should help them
 karlnapf	like name changes /type changes/new variables etc
 karlnapf	sonney2k, are you around? whats your opinion?
 blackburn	he is sleeping I guess
 blackburn	or I don't know
 blackburn	actually he tends to appear randomly
 karlnapf	same here :)
 karlnapf	(not the sleeping thing)
 blackburn	karlnapf: what is your opinion on moving lib* -> shogun/lib
 blackburn	liblinear
 blackburn	libsvm
 blackburn	libocas
 karlnapf	from machine to lib
 karlnapf	mmm
 karlnapf	dont know
 karlnapf	why?
 blackburn	from classifier
 karlnapf	why not?
 karlnapf	because its an external library?
 blackburn	yes
 karlnapf	I was a bit confused about that fact actually when I tried using shogun for the first time
 karlnapf	on the other hand
 karlnapf	all classifier are at one place now
 karlnapf	you would loose that
 blackburn	karlnapf: actually not
 blackburn	karlnapf: multiclass is already forked
 blackburn	from classifier
 blackburn	and both are using libocas and liblinear
 blackburn	ok I'll do pull request and ask you and soeren for comments
 blackburn	one more thing I don't like is liblinear is called SVM_linear
 karlnapf	agreed
 karlnapf	(both things)
 karlnapf	I will rewrite the subset stuff now
 karlnapf	will be much easier
 blackburn	ok
 karlnapf	and I just thought of a way for the migrations
 blackburn	sunday surprise for soeren
 blackburn	karlnapf: do you like shogun/lib/external
 blackburn	for that?
 karlnapf	yes, that would actually be nice
 karlnapf	blackburn, do we got a list type for SGVectors?
 blackburn	list of sgvectors?
 blackburn	no idea
 karlnapf	mmh I will just use DynArray then
