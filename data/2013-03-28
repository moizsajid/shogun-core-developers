 blackburn	n4nd0: what's that about admins?
 Yanglittle	hey, Is it implemented the L1-norm mkl in shogun? I read the mkl_multiclass.m file, it needs to provide the weights for each kernel.
 n4nd0	blackburn: Gary Bradski sent a reminder today to GSoC's ML
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me show you
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://pastebin.com/RUpGrBfp
 blackburn	n4nd0: alright thanks
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think I have updated my profile but not sure what it means :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe I am not sure either
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I think I did it too.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please check out http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012_ideas / etc
 blackburn	at least I converted my profile to mentor/admin
 n4nd0	I guess it should be enough to log in in there and check that your profile has your name and so
 blackburn	from student
 n4nd0	sonney2k: 2012 or 2013 ideas?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I've updated the css to look more stylish. please check if links are ok / it looks better
@sonney2k	2012 & 11
 blackburn	Yanglittle: yes we do have L1 MKL
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so the problem with those pages is that some links fail
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please fix them then
 n4nd0	sonney2k: check for example the first two links in GSoC 2012 pages
 n4nd0	GSoC 2011 ideas gets back to homepage
 Yanglittle	I mean it can't learn the weights automatically?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah please put a proper link there
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I just see that we even have a wrong link on the front page %-/
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn : we really need to polish http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas
@sonney2k	n4nd0, click MORE on the middle box
 blackburn	Yanglittle: no, why? it could learn the weights
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we will do today
 n4nd0	good!
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw I have an X-file here
 n4nd0	for some links, it doesn't matter how hard/how many times I try to define it as "open in this window/frame"
 n4nd0	it keeps on opening it on a new window
@sonney2k	n4nd0, maybe one can do that via css?
 n4nd0	mmm maybe, no idea honestly
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it is more of an HTML thing
 n4nd0	an option for the <a> tag
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but you have no options in there
 n4nd0	yes it is actually
 n4nd0	let me try modifying the HTML from the admin view
 n4nd0	meh it doesn't really matter
 n4nd0	I don't know why but the change always reverts
 blackburn	sonney2k: ModelSelectionParameter("width").as(EXPONENTIAL).from(-10).to(10);
 blackburn	n4nd0: ^
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	what do you think?
 n4nd0	do we have complex numbers there or??
 blackburn	I came to it when I was setting to sleep last night..
 blackburn	n4nd0: why?
 blackburn	exp -10 is real
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	aham I thought that it should be sth like
 n4nd0	exp(x) = -10
 blackburn	ModelSelectionParameter("kernel").from(gaussian_kernel,linear_kernel);
 blackburn	I think that's pretty readable?
 n4nd0	yes, it is indeed
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: concept goes here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/959
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's see what Heiko thinks when he comes around?
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	he developed the model selection framework right?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	API or framework, I use these words too loosely :D
 Yanglittle	error: glpk.h from GNU glpk not included at compile time necessary here,,what dir should I put it in?
@sonney2k	blackburn, builder pattern :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, might be that we could just do that from C++
@sonney2k	so it would work for all interfaces
@sonney2k	n4nd0, which links are opening new targets?
@sonney2k	(and you don't want them to.)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012_ideas the two first ones here for example
 n4nd0	GSoC 2011 ideas and back to shogun tool...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but there is target="_blank" in there
@sonney2k	so it is easily fixed
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hehe try and tell me if you succeed :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, shall I or will you?
 n4nd0	I have already tried
 n4nd0	it just reappears
@sonney2k	ok then let me try
 n4nd0	maybe I was doing something wrong though
 n4nd0	I tried both using HTML and the admin GUI interface
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes that's somewhat like builder but without build
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see no problem implementing it with swig
 blackburn	no at all
 blackburn	Yanglittle: is it detected on ./configure?
 blackburn	have to go be back soon
 Yanglittle	maybe just now it didn't update, I installed again , now it's ok.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, interesting. doesn't work here either. I guess it is some tinymce thing
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham, it could be
 n4nd0	it looks like a bug to me though
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it indeed is a feature
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actually tinymce converts urls even
@sonney2k	it can do absolute <->releateive
@sonney2k	relative
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	and it always adds a target
 n4nd0	ahm I see
@sonney2k	I think we should just write _self there as target
@sonney2k	let me try
 n4nd0	but it should be possible to do without opening a new window as well I think
 n4nd0	aham! ok let's see
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, all the links in GSoC 2012 and GSoC 2011 are well now
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is there any way we can use the same style in GSoC 2011 and 2012 pages for the new 2013 one??
 n4nd0	btw you must have like 100 visits to your personal webpage from Sweden today haha
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that still opens a new window :/
@sonney2k	n4nd0, from you :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I've found how to do it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, click the full screen mode of tinymce
@sonney2k	n4nd0, then click the link
@sonney2k	then go to the button with the chain
@sonney2k	click it
@sonney2k	and then you get a menu where can configure everything
@sonney2k	same target new target whatever
 n4nd0	sonney2k: wow, good job!
-!- blackburn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 n4nd0	sonney2k: should I change the two in GSoC 2012 or are you on it?
 n4nd0	ok you already did it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we need more content everywhere
@sonney2k	*sigh*
 n4nd0	sonney2k: more specifically?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, all the stuff / posts we had for gsoc 2011/2012
@sonney2k	it is gone somehwere
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aren't those thins in news??
 n4nd0	I thought so
@sonney2k	only that our 'news' is Downloads
 n4nd0	hehe confusing
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please remove all these target=_blank stuff in the gsoc2012 / 2011 ideas lists?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you can use the html editor for that now
@sonney2k	(I guess copy & paste to vim and paste back is easiest)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, I think it doesn't look good opening new windows for the links in the ToCs
@sonney2k	hehe no
 n4nd0	the other ones through the text are good though
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how do you mean doing it with vim? I didn't understand
@sonney2k	n4nd0, press html knob
@sonney2k	then copy things into vim and paste back
@sonney2k	n4nd0, meanwhile I am copying things over from my blog to shogun-toolbox.org
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, oopsy I killed the 2011 content
@sonney2k	ahh no
@sonney2k	still there
@sonney2k	puh
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the thing of the links it is not working fine
@sonney2k	?
 n4nd0	it doesn't modify the html I think
@sonney2k	n4nd0, did you press update?
 n4nd0	and once the page is saved again, the links are opening a new window again :S
 n4nd0	I pressesd saved in the editor
 n4nd0	the thing is that I don't see any difference in the html code
 n4nd0	between the links that open new windows and the ones that do not
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ???
 n4nd0	all of them are open in new windows now again though..
 n4nd0	check the links again
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what did you do?
 n4nd0	you can see that they are opened in new windows (as we didn't want to do)
 n4nd0	I didn't do anything :)
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	I just opened the change article window once
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well it worked here so what did you do ?
 n4nd0	and pressed save after changing a typo
 n4nd0	and the links got lost
 n4nd0	sonney2k: try on your own you can believe me :)
 n4nd0	fix a link again so it opens in the same window
 n4nd0	then open the change article again
@sonney2k	n4nd0, where did you change a typo?
 n4nd0	useability -> usability
@sonney2k	where!
@sonney2k	which page???
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012_ideas
 n4nd0	in the first of the list "Improving accesibility to shogun"
 n4nd0	but the links above it also screwed then

@sonney2k	n4nd0, please press shift reload on some admin page
@sonney2k	your browser likely cached the .js
 n4nd0	done
 n4nd0	shift+F5 several times done
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well I just fixed the page ... so it is working
 n4nd0	let me try modifying gsoc 2012 ideas from the admin interface
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is just remove the target="_blank" thingys right?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	then update in the hmtl then save in the change article page
 n4nd0	wow it is working fine now, alegria!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, as I said you browser cached the .js
 n4nd0	it'd make sense indeed
 n4nd0	you are wise :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: links in the table of contents are good now
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw I think this has to be done through the css; you see that all the info appears sort of framed? But there is no line on the right side of the frames. I think it would look better with it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, look at this http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2011
@sonney2k	I am a bit lost how we should do things
 n4nd0	tell me
@sonney2k	for GSoC we should have ideas list (subsubpage), Aftermath and?
@sonney2k	what troubles me is that for workshop we have somehow
@sonney2k	program / registration
@sonney2k	and a news page
@sonney2k	so I would love to have a similar structure for everything now
@sonney2k	(all events)
 n4nd0	mmm I understand
@sonney2k	so what should have a subsubmenu?
@sonney2k	I mean workshop program / registration is obviously static
 n4nd0	however I think that since GSoC and workshop are different things, it is ok that they have different number of sub-subpages
@sonney2k	gsoc ideas list is too
 n4nd0	gut I guess we could have
 n4nd0	the main GSoC 20XX showing something similar to what GSoC 2012 shows now
 n4nd0	then GSoC 20XX ideas list
 n4nd0	and then one more called something like blog or news
 n4nd0	where the stuff like the one you are adding now in main GSoC 2011 appear
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so you suggest that this first thing is an overview page only?
 n4nd0	so my idea is: a short main GSoC 20XX for each and then two subpages with long contents
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but how do we structure that with gsoc2013?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	I mean we have there 'we will apply for 2013'
 n4nd0	mmm well the news in gsoc 2013 will be empty atm
@sonney2k	then if / once we are in do we add a participation thing on top
 n4nd0	no, we just modify it
@sonney2k	then basically this entrance page is the news page
 n4nd0	we are planning -> we are partipating
@sonney2k	but then the old page is lost
 n4nd0	mm why? we can just modify the name of the article
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I mean would you do the same for the workshop? We had there we are planning to have a workshop
 n4nd0	I see no we are planning to have a workshop
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well there is no official announcement
@sonney2k	it is just save the date
@sonney2k	there will be an official announcement on top I guess
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	but I have no idea where that goes
@sonney2k	simples would be to have the entrance page to be a 'news' style page
-!- Yanglittle [deb20af8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.222.178.10.248] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, why not like that?
 n4nd0	I mean GSoC subpages just with one sub-subpage with ideas
@sonney2k	with items such as 'we are planning to participate' 'we are participating' 'aftermath' 'mentor summit'
 n4nd0	yes
@sonney2k	we might want to expose aftermath a bit more maybe
@sonney2k	so this could go in a separate subsub with some mentioning in the news overview
@sonney2k	I am happy with that
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: haha btw look at the definition of aftermath given by oxford dictionaries:
 n4nd0	"the consequences or after-effects of a significant unpleasant event"
@sonney2k	haha
@sonney2k	I guess we need a positive name then :D
 n4nd0	haha yeah!
@sonney2k	open for suggestions!
 n4nd0	let me think of it with google
 n4nd0	repercussion?
 n4nd0	no, that one is negative too
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	my english is worse than I thougth
 n4nd0	it is pretty similar to Spanish word, that's why I knew it
@sonney2k	follow-up!
 n4nd0	I don't think so... I hadn't heard aftermath before
 n4nd0	sonney2k: bingo
 n4nd0	I imagine google response: Rejected, you consider your experience in GSoC 2011 and 2012 as significant unpleasant.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, they might forgive us if we have lots of spelling mistakes in the applicaton ;)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: there might a trouble if you just call the sub-subpages ideas
 n4nd0	:%s/might/will
@sonney2k	yeah seen that
 n4nd0	will be*
 n4nd0	because sub-subpages are still subpages
@sonney2k	the links must include some prefix
@sonney2k	but the name can be the same
 n4nd0	aham ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2011
 n4nd0	yeah I am looking
@sonney2k	can we somehow show the Follow-Up article in the GSoC 2011 news?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the whole article?
 n4nd0	or just a link to it?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, hmmhh well link to it with some image is also fine
@sonney2k	I am just lazy I guess...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you do that?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: creating a new article that links to it I guess
@sonney2k	I can then continue with 2012
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	sonney2k: above or below mentor summit?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ?
 n4nd0	the link to follow-up
@sonney2k	ahh below
 n4nd0	ok, give some minutes and I will do it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I've done the same for 2012, could you please also go over this?
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	thanks
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you have entries for we are planning to participate, accepted, etc for 2011?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for 2011 not - I wasn't expecting that we get in and so I we don't
 n4nd0	heh ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we were rejected in 2010 so :)

 n4nd0	I think the article-link to follow-up 2011 is rather poor
 n4nd0	I didn't add one for follow-up 2012, I am not sure if it really helps to have it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do we want to use the same style for 2013
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just add some catchy figures (1-2)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: can we use the same style for 2013 ideas?
 n4nd0	what about the frame issue I told you about
 n4nd0	in the conclusions 2011 I will add the picture of GSoC 2011 since we don't hvae it anywhere :D

@sonney2k	n4nd0, I meant it is work to put the gsoc'13 ideas in the same form
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw I am clueless why the table border is not shown on the right...
 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what's the correct way of putting gsoc'13 ideas in the same form?
 n4nd0	is it necessary to re-write all the stuff?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well easiest is just to take the 2012 stuff and fill in the content
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	quite some work :/
@sonney2k	we should better do this offline
@sonney2k	because we have no history in the editor...
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	sonney2k: quite some work indeed
 n4nd0	but idk to re-write one proposal shouldn't take lot of time
 n4nd0	I estimate no more than 15 min per proposal
 n4nd0	I think that is a large upper bound
 n4nd0	we have barely 8 proposals
 n4nd0	if we are 4 people (you, heiko, blackburn and I) writing them it shouldn't take long
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well < 1 hour for all IMHO
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it can be a bit of a pain to do all of them by only one person
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: briefly - what is going on?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: discussing how to put the ideas in GSoC 2013 (http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas) with the style of 2011 and 2012 pages
 n4nd0	it seems they must be re-written
 n4nd0	I mean just moving the content from one place to another
 n4nd0	I will work on it this evening, blackburn wanna join? :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah sure
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k : are we getting new proposals?
 blackburn	n4nd0: proposals? like?
 n4nd0	I see we are missing ideas from Igor Carron and Cheng Soon Ong
 n4nd0	sorry, ideas :)
 n4nd0	project ideas
 blackburn	n4nd0: igor ideas are missed
 blackburn	n4nd0: cheng sent ideas - they are in gdco
 blackburn	gdoc
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	about cheng, not the other one hehe
 n4nd0	integration with mldata and mloss can be taken from previous years
 n4nd0	but we'd still miss improve static interfaces and interactive demos
 blackburn	yes mloss is our eternal idea

@sonney2k	blackburn, please have a look at the ideas document
 blackburn	sonney2k: alrighty
@sonney2k	I've filled in most stuff
@sonney2k	it might still need some polishing but I think it should be put live as is
@sonney2k	I've marked in red ideas that are not detailled yet
 blackburn	oh that's nice
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	I think it is 12-13 ideas or even more
 blackburn	that you filled in the stuff
@sonney2k	with 11 mentors
@sonney2k	(at least)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll put igor's stuff today once I get some eat
@sonney2k	blackburn, did igor contact you?
 blackburn	sonney2k: nope
 blackburn	sonney2k: is that holidays in germany these days?
@sonney2k	easter friday & monday
@sonney2k	blackburn, then maybe it is better to remove igors project from the list?
 blackburn	sonney2k: makes sense if he won't answer next days
@sonney2k	blackburn, well a student needs an answer within a day so this now is not a good sign
 blackburn	sonney2k: agree
 blackburn	sonney2k: but within a day is pretty strong requirement :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I received an answer from chris in 3 days
 blackburn	and an answer from konrad in 6 days
@sonney2k	well ok
@sonney2k	once gsoc is running that is important though
 blackburn	oh no
 blackburn	vice versa
 blackburn	konrad 2-3 days
@sonney2k	konrad?
 blackburn	and chris in 6 days may be :)
 blackburn	yes I wrote to konrad and chris in 2011
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am looking at the proposal now
@sonney2k	I am tempted to use a lot more stuff from last years proposals
 blackburn	feel free to change if you don't like
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you have time tonight - please use the 2012 html ideas stuff as a draft and squeeze the 2013 ideas into it
 blackburn	sonney2k: but do not forget to mention that we are all gsocers except one veteran
 blackburn	yes I have time
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is really important to do now
@sonney2k	to let students see what we are up to
@sonney2k	and show google that we have a plan(tm)
 blackburn	yeah google is more important yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, put the ideas in the publicity repository
 blackburn	sonney2k: we lose synchronization this way
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	drop the gdoc document once done
 blackburn	do heiko and fernando have access to publicity?
@sonney2k	blackburn, they see the webiste
@sonney2k	you can directly put it live from there
@sonney2k	you can use shogun-publicity/website/shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc/ideas-2012.html as a start
@sonney2k	blackburn, can I somehow extract the gdoc document? I need to work offline on this
@sonney2k	(will be gone in 2 mins)
 blackburn	I don't know
 blackburn	extract like?
 blackburn	you may export it
@sonney2k	yeah found it
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	SO learning proposal is in
 n4nd0	I see you discussed about it
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k : have you guys already starting writing something of gsoc 2013 in html?
 n4nd0	otherwise I will start it using gsoc 2012 as template and put it in a repo somewhere
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'll put current ideas to gsoc2012 format tonight
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can help you out with that
 blackburn	I am not sure how :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I was thinking that we could put the html in a temp repo
 n4nd0	so we can sync easily
 blackburn	n4nd0: we have a repo for that :) shogun-publicity
 n4nd0	blackburn: ook let's put it there then :)
 blackburn	yeah I will start soon, be back in a few minutes
 n4nd0	shogun-publicity?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah not sure you have access :)
 n4nd0	aham it is private one?
 n4nd0	I don't see it in github
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's terribly ugly actually to write such htmls
 blackburn	sonney2k: why do we have libqp again?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 blackburn	half done
-!- naywhayare [~ryan@spoon.lugatgt.org] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 blackburn	done
-!- sumit [73f91219@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.249.18.25] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea how to refer it though
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: so everything going fine with the doc?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah put it to the repo
 blackburn	but I just don't know how to refer it from the website
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think you can't
 n4nd0	you have to paste the html in the editor
 n4nd0	I can do that if you think it is ready
 blackburn	n4nd0: there are CSS which should be put too - don't know about that
 blackburn	I think soeren knows a way
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm I think the CSS was already handled for all of them
 n4nd0	maybe you are using a new style or sth
 blackburn	no there is a custom css
 n4nd0	let's see what sonney2k says then
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 whats the issue?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I put ideas-2013.html
@sonney2k	blackburn, and?
 blackburn	sonney2k: any way to refer it?
@sonney2k	???
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how to introduce the html there in the website
 n4nd0	it seems that there is also some css to put in
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ahh well just copy and paste it to the thing we have
@sonney2k	that's it
 blackburn	sonney2k: css?
@sonney2k	none
@sonney2k	blackburn, shall I do it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you want to
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I am not sure
@sonney2k	just go to admin interface
@sonney2k	and then edit the gsco2013 ideas list
 blackburn	sonney2k: but is gsoc list css there?
@sonney2k	press html
@sonney2k	(that will give a a window for editing html source code)
 blackburn	sonney2k: you must be kidding :D
@sonney2k	and paste the table in there
 blackburn	do you consider me an idiot or what :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok I am doing it :P
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes of course
 blackburn	the only thing I am worried is *css*
@sonney2k	you are russian
 blackburn	and?
@sonney2k	and vodka did kill your non-ml brain cells!
 blackburn	oh well
@sonney2k	blackburn, DON"T WORRY ABOUT CSS
 blackburn	well it is relevant, not?
 blackburn	there is some custom stuff
 blackburn	whatever
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think the idea was to use the same style of gsoc 2011 and 2012 pages for which there is already a CSS
 n4nd0	blackburn: but maybe we can add the new custom stuff in that CSS somehow
 blackburn	n4nd0: there is no new stuff comparing to 2012
@sonney2k	n4nd0, blackburn http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please remove the separate structured output thing
@sonney2k	blackburn, one question - it looks completely different to the 2012 thingy
@sonney2k	Mentor etc are not bold
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure, that article is going out now
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess you changed sth?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea may be I mixed that something in the tag forest
 blackburn	sonney2k: 2012 is not bold too
 blackburn	sonney2k: it looks completely the same here
@sonney2k	blackburn, indeed this stuff never has been bold
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is different?
@sonney2k	apologies
@sonney2k	nothing
@sonney2k	all good
 n4nd0	blackburn: multple instance learning links to robust classification
@sonney2k	blackburn, libqp is in there because nothing is done for that yet
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok fixing
 n4nd0	blackburn: aah no wait
 n4nd0	blackburn: link is fine, it is the title of multiple instance :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have no interfaces in modular / no general solver framework in shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: heh
 n4nd0	I don't fix it just in case you are also editing - don't want to screw things up
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see
@sonney2k	which would be rather cool to have
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes I'll fix
@sonney2k	blackburn, on top it says during summer 2013 ... lala
 blackburn	sonney2k: fixing it
@sonney2k	the 2012
@sonney2k	the text doesn't fit
@sonney2k	blackburn, and Reading and writing of shogun features / objects in .hdf5 (pytables/matlab 7.0/matlab 7.X/octave 3.x/h5py/arff) format
@sonney2k	should go away
@sonney2k	we only have that once
 blackburn	sonney2k: only fast?
 n4nd0	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, no i is twice in the TOC
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not understand
@sonney2k	yes that one thing w/o fast can go
 blackburn	what is twice there?
 blackburn	so fast goes away?
 n4nd0	the same project I think
@sonney2k	the matlab 7 / etc
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	fast stays
@sonney2k	the other goes
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	I am getting instable
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok let's get this shit done :)
 blackburn	let me update it in repo first
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 n4nd0	I still don't know about this repo
 n4nd0	blackburn: so look at the second and fourth projects in "improving accessibility"
 n4nd0	they look pretty similar
 blackburn	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas
 blackburn	n4nd0: done
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	blackburn: is the picture showing ok there?
 n4nd0	not here
 blackburn	n4nd0: no it disappeared
 blackburn	n4nd0: I have no idea how did I get that damaged
 n4nd0	let me see the html
 n4nd0	mmm I don't see anything weird
 n4nd0	got it
 n4nd0	try with this path to the image
 n4nd0	<td><img src="../../../../static/figures/shogun_logo.png" border="0" alt="SHOGUN Logo" width="50" /></td>
 n4nd0	blackburn: ^
 n4nd0	I got that from 2011 ideas page
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah already found that thanks
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas.html okay here the shit comes
 n4nd0	cool!
 n4nd0	blackburn: once you get tired of it let me go through it and check for typos if so
 blackburn	wheen I edit htmls manually I feel my life slips away
 n4nd0	hehe yeah
 n4nd0	I was not breathing while doing it this morning
 blackburn	the touch of death
 n4nd0	just in case something could get screwed :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that is actually what I just did
@sonney2k	hold breath for as long as possible but under water :)
 blackburn	we are the worst web designers ever
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha
 n4nd0	sonney2k: why under water? :)
 blackburn	http://www.miauk.com/
 blackburn	however these guys are even worse in web
 n4nd0	dafuq
 blackburn	http://www.lingscars.com/
 blackburn	http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/ we should buy that designer
 n4nd0	we should state that for "Implement estimators of large-scale sparse Gaussian densities" we need jeff dean as student
 blackburn	yeah jeff dean could be A CANDIDATE
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://supercreativ.narod.ru/
 blackburn	design bureau "creator"
 n4nd0	wtf
 blackburn	n4nd0: he wrote - I have a great experience with web - 2 months.
 blackburn	That's why I created a web design company
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	http://www.rasputin.de/CF/Jugend/
 n4nd0	fuck I have the sound on and woke up my gf
 blackburn	hah n4nd0 sorry
 n4nd0	hehe np
 blackburn	she must think something bad about you now
 blackburn	with that website ope
 blackburn	n
 n4nd0	nah sleeping again
 blackburn	it is better if it was redtube
 n4nd0	I closed at the moment I opened it
 n4nd0	haha probably
 blackburn	than that crazyness
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is definitely better to be catched watching gay porno that these sites
 blackburn	than*
 n4nd0	this is looking weird
 n4nd0	Improving accessibility to shogun by developing improving i/o support (more file formats), machine learning demos, and mloss.org/mldata.org integration.
 n4nd0	Integration of existing and new machine algorithms.
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is weird?
 n4nd0	it says at the beginning that we want to extend the library in three different ways
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes that's true as there is summer 2012 :D
 blackburn	okay fixing
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	update
 blackburn	d
 blackburn	n4nd0: we have not enough stars and pink color though
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: are you editing right now?
 blackburn	no
 n4nd0	ok I take the relay now
 blackburn	I am thinking of clicking my power button in next few minutes
 n4nd0	that's probably a good idea
 n4nd0	you wrote all this article - must be tiring
 blackburn	n4nd0: that's ok when one is on drugs
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	jk
 n4nd0	haha
@sonney2k	n4nd0, some swimming exercise with some trainer pushing us ...
@sonney2k	I was barely above water the last 1.5 hrs
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that's cool
 n4nd0	swimming is nice
@sonney2k	no
 n4nd0	haha why not?
@sonney2k	that was tough
 n4nd0	if it is not tough then it is not training :)
@sonney2k	I prefer swimming on the surface :)
@sonney2k	there is this big advantage
@sonney2k	there is AIR
 n4nd0	hehe
@sonney2k	just open your mouth :)
 blackburn	I am curious if I can swim still
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so do you train any water sport?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes he is dreaming of becoming a whale
 n4nd0	have you guys seen this btw? https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=A25VgNZDQ08
 blackburn	oh hitler is mad on *everything* :D
 n4nd0	indeed hehe
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah to both
@sonney2k	swimming
 n4nd0	sonney2k: why so much time under water then??
@sonney2k	blackburn, I thought you are the whale so there should be no problem for you to float :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well todays training...
 blackburn	sonney2k: why am I?
@sonney2k	dive as far as you can then swim the crawl
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what's your favourite style?
 n4nd0	I used to enjoy butterfly and breaststroke the most
@sonney2k	n4nd0, butterfly is tough
 n4nd0	yeah
@sonney2k	swimming is all about the technique so certainly mine is not optimal for butterfly
@sonney2k	I think I would last barely 100m's
@sonney2k	blackburn, about the proposal
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about the proposal?
@sonney2k	we have only 18 hours left right?
@sonney2k	I won't have *any* time tomorrow it seems
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah I think so
 blackburn	yes, would you like to keep asking me each hour?
 n4nd0	19h UTC so that is 18h in Germany/Sweden
 blackburn	I don't mind putting there some shit tomorrow if you are so busy
 n4nd0	but are the more things to change??
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that was only the ideas list
@sonney2k	there is the proposal too
 blackburn	n4nd0: well sonney2k wants to rewrite all the proposal as he thinks my writing is soo bad probably
 n4nd0	I think it was more or less ready (more more than less)
 n4nd0	aham I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: then mine is too since I went through it as well :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: alright you are bad too
 blackburn	sonney2k: so if there is no chance to fix it by you we'd have to live with current impossibly bad stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: one thing, I am editing some minor things using django admin interface in the ideas list so we shouldn't probably edit in that repo you mentioned and copy again
 blackburn	n4nd0: well may be I'll copy that back
 blackburn	if format is not ruined
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	nah, I don't think so. Just adding some carriage return here and there for the moment
 n4nd0	I get a little it picky :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: I mean is not ruined by these copy-paste perturbations and django
 n4nd0	oh all right
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please send around an email to all mentors with the current ideas list?
@sonney2k	it is mostly ready I guess
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: is vojtech in still?
@sonney2k	they should get a chance to have a final look and potentially suggest changes
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	libqp
 n4nd0	we have 14 ideas in there! that's nice
