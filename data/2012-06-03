 KMcQuisten	Where was it getting caught up?
 blackburn	hmmm something strange here..
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: funny thing x2 factor comes from the code, but not two feature instances..
 KMcQuisten	Really?  I wonder if it's pulling them from the initialized kernels
 blackburn	yeah..
 KMcQuisten	I tired a CombinedFeature and CombinedKernel with StringChar features and WD kernels of 2 different orders and got the same sort of error as with the StringWordFeatures
 KMcQuisten	SystemError: [ERROR] assertion char_vec && len>0 failed in file kernel/WeightedDegreeStringKernel.cpp line 522
 blackburn	different error
 KMcQuisten	Yes, but still failing the check to see if the proper number of features are present
 KMcQuisten	The same thing happens when I combine a WD kernel on StringChar features with a CommWOrdString kernel on StringWord features.
 KMcQuisten	Like you, I hae stringChar+Real and StringWord + real working fine
 blackburn	heh
 KMcQuisten	Somethign about this doesn't like having multiple kinds of string features in a CombinedKernel
 KMcQuisten	Very strange
 blackburn	does it happen with real+real?
 KMcQuisten	Let me check quicklty
 blackburn	hmm it happens with real+string now
 KMcQuisten	Real and Real worked for me
 KMcQuisten	Real and StringWord work for me
 KMcQuisten	Let me check Real and StringChar
 KMcQuisten	Real and StringChar work for me with a WD kernel
 KMcQuisten	ONly thing that fials for me is combining multibple string features
 KMcQuisten	man my typing is crap today.
 blackburn	heh
 KMcQuisten	Need more sleep :)
 blackburn	no problem
 blackburn	okay but real + string fails now too
 blackburn	real+real works
 KMcQuisten	Not for me.  Real + string still works for me
 KMcQuisten	real + real works for me, too
 KMcQuisten	I set it up real + string and string + real.  Both work
 blackburn	ok more or less it is clear now
 blackburn	I'll dig into the code again
 KMcQuisten	what's the verdict?
 KMcQuisten	Allrighty
 KMcQuisten	Ok, i'm going ot head out of here.  When you have news feel free to let me know on the mailing list.

 pluskid	blackburn: do you know how to clone a VowpalWabbitMachine?
 blackburn	a=b.clone()?
 pluskid	is there such a method?
 blackburn	I don't think so
 pluskid	hmm, too bad
 pluskid	I want to have a copy of a VWMachine somewhere
 blackburn	add a copy constructor :)
 pluskid	seems I have to construct the copy manually
 pluskid	to do that then I should have to understand the implementation of VW first
 pluskid	btw: since shogun has a generic serialization component, I guess it should not be too difficult to build a generic clone component based on that
 blackburn	virtual clone method?
 pluskid	I'm not sure, but I guess it could be implemented in a similar way to serialization
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 pluskid	for example, a *very naive* way is to serialize it to some where and then de-serialize, we get a clone ...
 blackburn	I don't mind actually if somebody do that :)
 pluskid	:D

 n4nd0	hey wiking
 n4nd0	how did it go in the conference?
 n4nd0	still there?
 wiking	arrived today
 wiking	i mean i came back today
 n4nd0	good
 n4nd0	did you enjoy it?

 wiking	yeah it was great
 wiking	but today i still need to recover

 blackburn	when do you think you can get back on the track?

 KMcQuisten	Hello all
 blackburn	hey
 KMcQuisten	Get my email?
 blackburn	which one?
 KMcQuisten	most recent.  sent today
 KMcQuisten	moments ago, inf act
 blackburn	ah right I just sent an answer
 blackburn	10 mins ago I guess
 KMcQuisten	well then let me look
 blackburn	ok I suggested to turn off linadd at all
 KMcQuisten	ok let me check
-!- heiko [~heiko@109.144.207.254] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	it can be that linadd is a little broken
 KMcQuisten	Looks like tha'ts the case.  It works with LINADD disables
 KMcQuisten	d
 wiking	blackburn: tomorrow
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: cool too :)
 KMcQuisten	Looks like we got this squared away for now.
 KMcQuisten	Thanks for all your helop
 blackburn	no problem! ok then I know something is broken in linadd here
 KMcQuisten	Glad I could help root these out.
 KMcQuisten	I think I may have found another one, though.
 KMcQuisten	if I do mkl.get_kernel().get_subkernel_weights() to extract the weights after training, I get this:
 KMcQuisten	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "mkl_linadd_regression.py", line 76, in <module>     mkl_binclass_modular (*parameter_list[0])   File "mkl_linadd_regression.py", line 71, in mkl_binclass_modular     print mkl.get_kernel().get_subkernel_weights()
 KMcQuisten	TypeError: Kernel_get_subkernel_weights expected 1 arguments, got 0
 blackburn	hmm
 KMcQuisten	If I just use the method on a frech CombinedKernel, everything works fine, but if I pass a kernel to a machine and train it, I get that error when I try to extract the weights
 blackburn	ahh I think I know
 KMcQuisten	righto
 blackburn	different types
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  when I extract the kernel, it's just type "Kernel",
 blackburn	get_kernel() returns CKernel
 blackburn	so rather use old pointer or cast it somehow
 KMcQuisten	Then how should I get my subkernel weights after I train an MKL?
 blackburn	let me check why CKernel has that method
 blackburn	well you have combined kernel somewhere in code
 blackburn	just call get_subkernel_weights on that
 blackburn	it will be the same kernel still after train too
 KMcQuisten	if I call the method from the variable I used to set up the combined kernel, it segfaults
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	let me fix it then
