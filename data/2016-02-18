@wiking	ok so question
@wiking	how would you debug when there are 2 processes with an unnamed pipes
@wiking	and they are blocked
@wiking	gdb is just saying me that they are waiting on mutex
@wiking	i suspect that there's something with the pipe buffer
@besser82	hmm...  Pipe is access in which way?  Handle-ptr?
@besser82	and the mutex comes from where?
@besser82	It hard to get poit to start from, when not knowing about the code...
@wiking	ah mutexes are some other stories
@wiking	so it's just
@wiking	you have
@wiking	proc1 | proc2
@besser82	k
@besser82	So proc1 opens an unnamed pipe?  and proc2 is listening on this?
@besser82	or is the pipe setup before, like static?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	static
@wiking	i open a pipe with 2 ends
@wiking	one given to proc1
@wiking	the other to proc2
@wiking	that is actually child of proc1
@besser82	and the pipe is blocked then?
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	that's the question
@wiking	i dont know what's actually happening
@wiking	the proc1 sent everything on the pipe
@wiking	and it's doing a wait() on proc2
@wiking	while proc2 is waiting for data
@wiking	:)
@besser82	I see...
@besser82	Have you tried to set the pipe to be non-blocking?

@HeikoS	wiking: gsoc aplication looks good now
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking I had an idea: we will make all GSoC students do a joint project, which is populating the manual
@HeikoS	every week, they have to add a few items, or improve otherwise
@HeikoS	thoughts?
 lisitsyn	sounds good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we should merge this thing soon
@HeikoS	so that we can accept patches for it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any news on the shogun class doc links?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no, sorry %(
 sonne|work	HeikoS: the joint project idea might be good actually to form some kind of community feeling
@HeikoS	sonne|work: exactly
@HeikoS	Ill put this into our application as well
@HeikoS	sonne|work: still up for the approx kernel project?
 sonne|work	it should not require too much time from them and it would be best if they work on the same  section so they have to interact...
 sonne|work	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	I agree
@HeikoS	cool, I will write a descriptin soon then
