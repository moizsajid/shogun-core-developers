 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
@sonney2k	wassup
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you can please fix the buildbot errors - this is really highest prio now...
 blackburn	sonney2k: sparse w/ python?
 blackburn	I got stucked there a little yesterday
 blackburn	sonney2k: can I ask you some debian things?
 blackburn	ok leaving now for a while - will ask later :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, where did you get stuck?
@sonney2k	what is the problem?

 blackburn	sonney2k: with detecting error
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yesterday I got stucked with detecting error
@sonney2k	doesn't valgrind help?
@sonney2k	I mean it must be due to the refcounting business
 blackburn	yes it helps but I didn't localized the error
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can I get bootable usb for installing debian?
@sonney2k	don't know out of my head
 blackburn	they provide some crazy ways of installing it in debian doc
 blackburn	is that really so complex?
 blackburn	ok probably live version can be copied via dd
 puffin444	Hey blackburn can I ask you a question.
 blackburn	sure
 puffin444	I'm trying to think of ways to reduce computational redundancy in my GP code, so I store kernel matrices and other calcuated matrices until parameters are changed.
 puffin444	This way they are not recalculated. A problem with this though is that when I use Heiko's model selection scheme to set parameters, the CMachine has no idea that parameters have been changed.
 puffin444	Do you what caching/matrix storage schemes have been used in the past to overcome these things? Heiko may have more information, but he is not here at the moment.
 blackburn	uhh
 puffin444	Don't worry about it :)
 blackburn	let me try to get into it
 blackburn	so you work with CMachines
 puffin444	Yes.
 blackburn	and you want to know when parameters are changed?
 puffin444	Exactly.
 blackburn	I don't see how to get it done currently
 blackburn	puffin444: that parameters framework actually don't know about changing parameters too
@sonney2k	puffin444, what you could do is extend the framework and e.g. compute the md5sum of all parameters
@sonney2k	if that sum changes
 puffin444	Would it be bad to add some abstract update() function to CMachine? Or is that just a lazy solution?
@sonney2k	-> parameters changed
 blackburn	that would take some time for you puffin444
 blackburn	but actually it is worth I think
 blackburn	void fire_parameter_changed(const char* name)
 puffin444	Is there an md5sum algorithm already in shogun, or would I have to use an external library/implement it myself?
@sonney2k	puffin444, yes there is
 blackburn	why to compute md5?
@sonney2k	look at CHash
@sonney2k	blackburn, to see if parameters change
 blackburn	sonney2k: well if set_* is called we can assume it is changed
@sonney2k	why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you on debian sid now?
 puffin444	Okay. So would it make sense to add an md5sum member in SGObject that stores the md5sum of its model selection parameter tree?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 puffin444	Or would simply a function that calculates an md5sum of a parameter tree suffice?
@sonney2k	puffin444, heiko is the expert here
@sonney2k	not sure what is best
 puffin444	okay.
 blackburn	puffin444: why do you need to work with parameters at all?
 blackburn	just curious
 puffin444	I use the model selection framework to do hyperparameter learning. Whenever one of those parameter changes I need to recalcuate the matrices I need.
 blackburn	why is it so general?
 puffin444	The gradient search was written to be used with arbitrary machines.
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	hah nice no wi-fi driver in debian live
 blackburn	no display driver as well
 blackburn	and I have no cable
@sonney2k	puffin444, btw I would go for a m_parameter_checksum in SGObject for the time being
 puffin444	Okay. I think I can write an MD5 sum function using CHash.
 blackburn	will that approach require you to add anything to setters?
@sonney2k	puffin444, alternatively you can also use murmurhash2 (also in CHash) should be good enough I think
 blackburn	hmm it failes here to link with nlopt for some reason
 blackburn	I guess I compiled nlopt w/o shared
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm I just got I do what I did yesterday
 blackburn	probably my commit went to hell
 blackburn	I was really sure I pushed it

@sonney2k	wiking, any news on your PR?
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra10eab1 / (3 files in 3 dirs): Fixed sparse matrix handling in static - http://git.io/356OIw
 blackburn	sonney2k: found it in backups :D
 blackburn	kind of mystic
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know where one should report if kernel does not detect whether AC adapter changes status?
@sonney2k	blackburn, reportbug <packagename>
@sonney2k	blackburn, or lkml
 blackburn	no idea about package name :D
 blackburn	I tried everything
 blackburn	still acpi does not fire that AC is plugged
 blackburn	state is being set correctly
 blackburn	in /proc/acpi/battery
 blackburn	the only bug left with my new notebook (I spent some time forcing it to produce lesser heat)
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you try to compile your own 3.4 / 3.5-rc kernel to see if it is fixed there?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I installed 3.4 from kernel-ppa - no help here
@sonney2k	blackburn, then send an email to lkml asking for help
 blackburn	sonney2k: problem is I am unsure it is a kernel bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: /proc/ stuff updates perfectly - but acpi doesn't catch it
 blackburn	may be I should try newer acpid?
 blackburn	still the same with newer acpid argh
@sonney2k	cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ADP1/state
@sonney2k	state:                   off-line
@sonney2k	cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ADP1/state
@sonney2k	state:                   on-line
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ it is all in kernel stuff
@sonney2k	so kernel bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: that thing is being updated
 blackburn	sonney2k: run acpi_listen and plug in / plug out your AC
 blackburn	you should see some msgs here - I do not
@sonney2k	I don't have acpid installed
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	sonney2k: how does it detect whether you are running AC??
@sonney2k	why should it detect it?
 blackburn	well for gnome
@sonney2k	some gnome stuff no idea
 blackburn	and for laptop mode
@sonney2k	I think upowerd does that
@sonney2k	which laptop mode?
 blackburn	sonney2k: laptop-mode-tools package
@sonney2k	useless stuff...
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it controls cpufreqd
@sonney2k	why that
@sonney2k	just use in kernel on-demand
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm well it has its own configuration
@sonney2k	snakeoil
 blackburn	may be it could be a good idea to use only cpufreqd
@sonney2k	not even that
@sonney2k	just use ondemand in kernel
@sonney2k	*always*
 blackburn	sonney2k: in kernel??
 blackburn	how do you handle that in kernel?
@sonney2k	echo ondemand > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
@sonney2k	(and all your other cpu's)
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do you make it persistent?
@sonney2k	put it in some init script
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have anything in /etc/cpufreqd.conf?
@sonney2k	I don't have that installed
@sonney2k	nite
