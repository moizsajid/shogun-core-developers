 nickp_	Hello
 nickp_	Is this the right place to ask dev questions about Shogun?
 nickp_	I'm trying to add the obtain_from_generic method to the GaussianARDKernel
 nickp_	I pretty much copies the code from GaussianKernel::obtain_from_generic
 nickp_	*copied
 nickp_	Getting this error from python
 nickp_	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "main.py", line 23, in <module>     from shogun.Features import *   File "/path/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/shogun/Features/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>     from modshogun import *   File "/path/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 30, in <module>     _modshogun = swig_import_helper()   File "/path/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 26, in swig_i

 nickp_	Anyone know what is wrong?

 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	nickp_: if u are still here: that's what actually happen... it should typecast the kernel to gaussianARDkernel as in python you cannot do this...
 wiking	but what is interesting
 nickp_	yeah I'm here
 wiking	ah shit
 wiking	sorry i've mixed up
 wiking	ok
 wiking	have you defined K_GAUSSIANARD in Kernel.h?
 wiking	but i guess
 wiking	there must be some other problem.... if u managed to recompile shogun library with that new code
 wiking	have u for sure (110%) overwritten the library with the new .so and .a?
 wiking	since if u have this new function in the code
 wiking	then it should be able to find it
 nickp_	Yeah I've defined it: K_GAUSSIANARD = 510,
 wiking	ok
 nickp_	Yeah I'm pretty sure I've over written it.
 wiking	u use linux?
 nickp_	I manually deleted the shogun .so I previously had
 nickp_	Yeah I'm on ubuntu
 wiking	ok
 nickp_	I was working with virtualenv for the python environment
 nickp_	so I'm trying deleting the whole virtualevn directory
 nickp_	and trying again
 nickp_	to see if that works
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	you should be able to find the symbol in libshogun.13.so
 wiking	_ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE
 wiking	but i just cannot remember atm what is the disasm command in linux
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	objdump -d <the path to your shogun>/libshogun.13.so|grep _ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE
 wiking	this should have an ouptut ;
 wiking	output
 wiking	if not then you should try first
 wiking	objdump -d src/shogun/libshogun.13.so|grep _ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE
 wiking	that should have an output for sure
 wiking	nickp_: let me know what are your ouptuts :D
 nickp_	ok will try that now
 nickp_	just wainting for compilation
 wiking	no worries
 nickp_	Ouput is:
 nickp_	$ objdump -d libshogun.so.13.0 |grep _ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE 0000000000b28b60 <_ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE>:   b28b72:74 29                je     b28b9d <_ZN6shogun18CGaussianARDKernel19obtain_from_genericEPNS_7CKernelE+0x3d>
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so it's there
 wiking	make install
 wiking	and then try the python code
-!- blackburn1 [~blackburn@188.168.2.38] has joined #shogun
 nickp_	hmm
 nickp_	so I tried the same command and get the same output
 nickp_	but then from a python console
 nickp_	>>> import shogun >>> from shogun.Kernel import GaussianKernel Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/home/nickp/Dropbox/Repos/mkl/mklenv/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/shogun/Kernel/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>     from modshogun import *   File "/home/nickp/Dropbox/Repos/mkl/mklenv/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 30, in <module>     _modshogun = swig_import_he
 nickp_	>>> from shogun.Kernel import GaussianARDKernel Segmentation fault
 nickp_	So gives unresolved import for GaussianARDKernel when importing GaussianKernel
 wiking	lol
 nickp_	and then a segfault when importing GaussianARDKernel
 blackburn1	nickp_: I just read your mail
 blackburn1	and I thinkyou missed static word in .cpp
 blackburn1	I do not remember if it is relevant here
 blackburn1	probably not
 nickp_	I have static CGaussianARDKernel* obtain_from_generic(CKernel* kernel); in GaussianARDKernel.h
 nickp_	Is that correct ^
 nickp_	It's the same as for GaussianKernel
 wiking	that should be alright
 wiking	do you use the latest commit of the shogun repo
 wiking	?
 wiking	because it looks like as if you dont have that interfaces patch i've done the other time
 blackburn1	wiking: did you get your paper done?
 wiking	lol
 wiking	no
 wiking	:)
 wiking	ran out of time
 blackburn1	argh
 wiking	yeah shit happens
 nickp_	Yeah I've got those changes:
 nickp_	%rename(LinearARDKernel) CLinearARDKernel; %rename(GaussianARDKernel) CGaussianARDKernel;
 nickp_	in Kernel.i and Kernel_includes.i
 wiking	nickp_: i'll try your patch on my machine
 wiking	just to be safe
 wiking	but i'm 100% that that should work alright
 nickp_	ok cool thanks so much
 nickp_	If you're works, I'll just grab that instead.
 nickp_	No idea what I'm doing wrong.
 wiking	me neither
 wiking	but i'm defenetly sure that somewhere it tries to use a wrong library
 wiking	and older version of it

@sonney2k	nickp_, what does ldd  /path/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/_modshogun.so say?
@sonney2k	I second wiking - you have the wrong lib lying around somewhere
 nickp_	I'll check
 nickp_	sec
 nickp_	libshogun.so.13 => /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so.13 (0x00007fdb15dc4000)
 nickp_	so that's the problem ^ ?
 nickp_	because I thought I had shogun installed in a virtualenv
@sonney2k	is that the correct one?
 nickp_	but seems to be linking to system wide one I installed earlier.
@sonney2k	or do you expect the lib somewhere else?
 nickp_	I expect it to be in /path/ ...
 nickp_	not /usr/local
 nickp_	When I ran ./configure
@sonney2k	yeah then it is clear
 nickp_	I passed --interfaces=python_modular --prefix=/home/nickp/path/...
@sonney2k	what were your configure options?
@sonney2k	then it will install into /home/nickp/path/
 nickp_	Won't  it put everything in that directory when I run make install
 nickp_	Yeah that's what I want
@sonney2k	but you need to give it LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/nickp/path/... too
@sonney2k	when running python etc
@sonney2k	and PYTHON_PATH etc etc
 nickp_	to why does _modshogun link to /usr/local/lib/...
 nickp_	ooooh
 nickp_	ok
 nickp_	cool thats
 nickp_	*thanks
 nickp_	Will recompile now and give it a try, but that sounds like it should fix things.
 nickp_	are ld_library_path and python_path the only other args I need to add.
@sonney2k	I am not 100% sure but I think so
 nickp_	Working
 nickp_	thanks chaps!
