@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  hey!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: do you have a minute?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I want to talk a bit about the schedule
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: Since I haven't been very active in interacting with you over the last weeks, I will now annoy you with requests every day :)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, hey, sry was afk
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, of course i am goin through you rcoments right now
 Saurabh7	*comments
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: no worries.
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so since I have more time now, I would like to interact a bit more
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: And I would like us to structure your work schedule a bit more.
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok so what do you think should be my next steps?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  iam almost done with updating with the regrssion nb rioght now
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: (btw the intro notebook is really coming along nice, just adding some final comments)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: could you make a queue of things to address next? This will help us planning
@HeikoS	we can use our google doc for that
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: just put in the next steps/things to do, and how long they might take
@HeikoS	once we have this, we can think about the overall schedule in general
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok, i will start with adding the list of things you mentioned in demo now
 Saurabh7	then I will make a list of things about the nbs
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: could you do the list now?
@HeikoS	Then I can comment on it live while you are doing it
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: lets just plan a bit, before coding/writing :)
@HeikoS	let me find the googledoc
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	Just fill in your next steps, and let me know once done :)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: lets structure even more, everything deserves a single point, this helps focussing a lot (at least for me :) )
