 sonne|work	uricamic: so how is live? are you still w/ vojtech?
 uricamic	sonne|work: yep, still with Vojtech, focusing again on the facial landmarks localization
 sonne|work	like nose/eyes etc?
 uricamic	yes, I am finishing now with problems of our detector on higher resolution images
 uricamic	and then we will work on extension on multiple views and tracking
 sonne|work	is this using your speeded up version of BMRM + SO ?
 uricamic	yes, but not yet to my complete satisfaction
 sonne|work	I would wish we had some example as fancy as this for SO in shogun
 uricamic	and before Christmas we have submitted paper about the speeded up version of BMRM
 sonne|work	ICML or where to?
 sonne|work	or journal?
 uricamic	no, this will not be published in proceedings, it is just workshop for phd students
 sonne|work	I see. But you are close to finishing anyway aren't you?
 uricamic	but I would like to finish it to the state when it will be publishable in something more fancy
 uricamic	you mean with the studies?
 sonne|work	yes
 uricamic	far from that, I am now just finishing the 3rd semester
 uricamic	and we have it here for 8 at least
 sonne|work	uricamic: wow! didn't know that you are that young still. so we can expect quite some nice stuff from you in the future :D
 uricamic	sonne|work:  :D I hope so :)

 sonne|work	uricamic: is there any chance that you will write some fancy example that utilizes your new SO code in shogun? something eyecandy I mean...
 uricamic	sonne|work: I was thinking about something, depends how much other work will I have to do...
 uricamic	but generally, yes
 sonne|work	uricamic: would be very cool and could make it to the shogun front page if it is really fancy :)
 uricamic	sonne|work: ok, that would be nice :)
