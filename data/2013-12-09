 sonne|work	good morning everyone!
 sonne|work	hey besser82 any updates?
 besser82	sonne|work: Not yet.  :(  During weekend I mostly was busy with them kidz.  ;)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: any thoughts about our readme.md business? I mean how we integrate it ultimately?
 sonne|work	besser82: heh sure
 sonne|work	besser82: I hope you did sing some x-mas songs :D
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, sure

@iglesiasg	sonne|work, readme should go where page/about/information currently is, right?
 besser82	sonne|work: und liebe Kinder gebt fein acht;  Ich hab' das Christkind umgebracht  :-P  (Oliver Kalkhofe)  XD
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, maybe any other page can be substituted by markdown document too
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, and the rest could appear somewhere under documentation
 sonne|work	besser82: *lol*
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: we have some overlap in documentation/ actually
 sonne|work	I would want to get rid of those *.page files then and use markdown for that
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: maybe we should have the README.md as only file in the root directory of shogun
 sonne|work	and then have all the .md pages under doc/md or so
 sonne|work	and convert the *.page files to .md
 sonne|work	we would then have the README.md as entry file into all the rest with proper symlinks
 sonne|work	s/symlinks/links
@iglesiasg	I like the idea
