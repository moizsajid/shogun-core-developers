 alexlovesdata	I see a small problem with streamingdotfeatures and on the fly -preprocessors
 alexlovesdata	my suggestion is for on the fly preprocessors to use a different approach:
 alexlovesdata	to define a member function of the preprocessor class which takes streamingdotfeatures as input and outputs a new streamingdotfeature which is " on the fly-preprocessing enabled"
 alexlovesdata	this may resolve ambiguities better than attaching preprocessors to streamingdotfeatures when using dot
 alexlovesdata	currently preproc seems to be not used in StreamingDenseFeatures (!)
 alexlovesdata	so preprocessors seem to have no effect

@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, hey there
@sonney2k	if I would do it I would write the dense_dot / add_to_dense_vec functions directly
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, I would *not* write some x -> phi(x) transformation function
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, yes I know this is more effort and you have to do it for dense and sparse features
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, however you can use the very same functions for both streaming{dense,sparse} and dense/sparse
@sonney2k	n4nd0: nowo or which Sebastian do you mean?
