 besser82	sonne|work:  hey!
 besser82	sonne|work:  just seen Orion has done a PR  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  He's one from da Fedora-Crew, too  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: heh :)
 sonne|work	besser82: give us more :D
 sonne|work	besser82: and seen the python3 buildbot?
 besser82	sonne|work:  seen it!
 besser82	sonne|work:  Doing my best to recruit fresh devs for da shogun  :D
 sonne|work	besser82: I was confused - didn't you 2to3 your changes?
 besser82	sonne|work:  2to3 is somewhat basic stuff
 sonne|work	besser82: I mean does doxy2swig work then or not?
 besser82	sonne|work:  no, no with 2to3, but I got a ver from adrin which works ~98%
 besser82	sonne|work:  just need to add some decode / encode magixx to it  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: ahh cool
 besser82	sonne|work:  and that's what I just want to get started  :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  and fixing version.cmake, off course
 sonne|work	besser82: do it :)
 besser82	sonne|work:  then I'll start to dig deeper into those failing examples
 sonne|work	besser82: first the compile then the tests then the examples and then the world ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: so what do you do instead of my hack:
 sonne|work	import os.path,time;print time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', time.gmtime(os.path.getmtime('${ROOT_DIR}/NEWS' in version.cmake?
 besser82	sonne|work:  yes
 besser82	sonne|work:  print is not a statement in Py3, it's a function
 besser82	sonne|work:  so slamming brackets around the portion after `print` should do tha trick
 besser82	sonne|work:  I hope at least
 sonne|work	besser82: well I meant more the if this can be done with cmake but sure that would sufficiently work
 besser82	sonne|work:  such operations cannot be done with cmake, strftime, i mean...
 besser82	sonne|work:  that's why cmake has such option to invoke external-command and pass stdout from that into a var  ;)
@wiking	there's a swig PR somewhere that does doxy2swig but unfortunately hasn't been merged (and seems never will be)
 sonne|work	besser82: ok just tried - changing brackets is sufficient
 besser82	wiking:  so it wouldn't help us, right?
 besser82	sonne|work:  kk, will do && push
 sonne|work	besser82: yes please do ... I cannot from here

 besser82	sonne|work:  yes  :D
 sonne|work	besser82: alright now my misconfiguration
 sonne|work	wiking: could you help fixing it?
@wiking	sonne|work: fix what?
 sonne|work	wiking: deb4 - python3
@wiking	sonne|work: and somebody will write for me my thesis i guess :)
 sonne|work	wiking: only if you want to become a german politician
@wiking	sonne|work: :P
@wiking	sonne|work: make python_static
@wiking	instead of _python_static
 sonne|work	wiking: I cannot login from here...
@wiking	ic
 besser82	sonne|work:  is you sure those crufty legacy static interf will build!?!?
 besser82	wiking:  me cannot log either  ;)  Not in auth_keys  ;)

@wiking	sonne|work: there u go
 besser82	sonne|work:  :-P  No bot-net here  ;)  Just busy workerz on ~20 Servers  :D
 sonne|work	wiking: that was lightning fast
 sonne|work	besser82: I would love to but there are some users on *static still
 sonne|work	besser82: so now we need the doxy2siwg fixes
 besser82	sonne|work:  on it...  Just a few minutes...
 besser82	sonne|work:  that shit static thing chokes on Python3  :-P
 sonne|work	besser82: not on the buildbot at least :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  then let's announce a drop of static for next major-release
 sonne|work	besser82: that would kill our matlab / r support :/
 sonne|work	besser82: but for me fine
@wiking	sonne|work: r_modular we have
 sonne|work	r_modular works so so yes
 besser82	sonne|work:  i just wanted to say that
@wiking	sonne|work: and seems to be working apart from travis... which needs a little bit more love
 besser82	sonne|work:  and matlab could be done from octave_modular, I guess?!?
@wiking	besser82: could it?
 sonne|work	besser82: no
@wiking	i think we have to stick with matlab static
 sonne|work	there were tons of attempts of providing swig wrappers
 sonne|work	but no ones does it
@wiking	but currently it's not being built in the right way... dunno how to generate that mex file
 sonne|work	wiking: well if we stick to one interface we have to keep the others
 sonne|work	otherwise people can hardly migrate
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah we have a problem with matlab since cmake switch as i never managed to figure out where the mex file is coming from
 sonne|work	since I no longer have matlab I cannot fix it
@wiking	well that's ok just somebody tell me how to generate the mex file :)
 sonne|work	wiking: well I run the same commands mex would do ... so either run mex or run the commands mex -v would

 besser82	sonne|work:  this ^^ is not guranteed to work, but will bring us a nice step further

 sonne|work	besser82: excellent!
 besser82	sonne|work:  but it looks like class_list.cpp.py needs some changes too, at least on Fedora
 sonne|work	besser82: could you please open tests/integration/python_modular/tester.py
 sonne|work	and change the print in line 40?
 besser82	sonne|work:  sure!  would that be all?!?
 sonne|work	it should give us some insight why things fail
 sonne|work	besser82: no idea check for further prints or 2to3 even...
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah use 2to3
 besser82	sonne|work:  over the whole tree {test, examples} ?!?
 sonne|work	errm for tester.py
 besser82	sonne|work:  kk, a minute

 besser82	sonne|work:  that static-legacy is last ones on my list ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  let's get the modular ones && all other stuff running
 besser82	sonne|work:  then fix legacy
 besser82	sonne|work:  with the doxy2swig from adrin, one needs to have a utf8-locale set...

 besser82	sonne|work:  will take care of that after lunch
 sonne|work	besser82: thx
 besser82	sonne|work:  but what really makes me wonder is the fact sth. is going wrong in da test, but it still passes  :S
 besser82	sonne|work:  like an exception gets thrown and that is still *PASS*
 sonne|work	besser82: I think the old integration* tests fail
 sonne|work	rest seems good I think
 besser82	sonne|work:  they actually fail, yes, but ctest reports them as *PASS* anyways

 besser82	sonne|work:  like this ^^^  :S
 besser82	sonne|work:  the test failed, but ctest says *PASS*  That's weird and may lead to unforeseeable errors...
 besser82	sonne|work:  lemme check tester.py htat might be the key...
 sonne|work	besser82: but these are only the old integration-* tests
 besser82	sonne|work:  so not important to py_modular?!?
 sonne|work	besser82: so not the newer ones we do with generator / tester.py
 besser82	sonne|work:  shouldn't we fix that anyways?
 besser82	sonne|work:  I mean the behaviour of ctest *PASS* / *FAIL*
 sonne|work	besser82: well lets say these are legacy tests that are worth keeping again because they run the exact same stuff the static interfaces run in these regression tests
 sonne|work	besser82: so yes
 besser82	sonne|work:  kk, will do so too
 besser82	sonne|work:  is there any special reason for those legacy integration tests are executed like this:
 besser82	/usr/bin/cmake "-DEXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3" "-DFILE=/home/buildslave/deb4_-_python3/build/tests/integration/python_modular/tester.py" "-DARGS=statistics_kmm.py" "-DGDB_COMMAND=/usr/bin/gdb" "-DGDB_SCRIPT=/home/buildslave/deb4_-_python3/build/src/.gdb" "-P" "/home/buildslave/deb4_-_python3/build/cmake/checkgdb.cmake"
 besser82	sonne|work:
 besser82	sonne|work:  ^^^
 besser82	sonne|work:  the newer ones are run like python ${test}...
 sonne|work	errm maybe the reason was that we run them through gdb + backtrace if the test fails
 besser82	sonne|work:  I see
 besser82	sonne|work:  let me find a solution ...
 besser82	sonne|work:  easy to archive, thing  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  I just need to add MESSAGE( FATAL_ERROR "FAIL" ) to checkgdb.cmake script  ;)
 sonne|work	ok...
 besser82	sonne|work:  that would reflect an errorlevel !=0 by the cmake-exec  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  which would make ctest recognize that fail

 sonne|work	besser82: hurray finally some failures ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  yes, and some lot false positive as well  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  I need to improve that IF(RESULT) part in checkgdb.cmake  :(
 sonne|work	besser82: what is wrong with it?
 besser82	sonne|work:  It always is true, even if there is just warning or some non-fail msg in RESULT
 sonne|work	hmmhh - I guess that is because the old integration tests don't work
 besser82	sonne|work:  So tests which pass, but produces output of any kind currently report as fail
 sonne|work	besser82: better focus on the new ones
 sonne|work	besser82: ohh

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: only report really failing tests as failed
 besser82	sonne|work:  now i'm testing whether there is output matching ".*THE FOLLOWING TESTS FAILED.*"
 besser82	sonne|work:  and only trigger the failure procedure after there's a match
 sonne|work	besser82: what?
 sonne|work	besser82: that doesn't seem correct
 sonne|work	besser82: we run checkgdb for each test right?
 sonne|work	besser82: so if the test fails it should return RESULT that triggers
 sonne|work	otherwise nothing
 besser82	sonne|work:  some tests report stuff like "multiclass/MulticlassStrategy.cpp line 45: MulticlassStrategy::CMulticlassStrategy(): register parameters!" to RESULT

 besser82	sonne|work:  which isn't a fail but just some garbage

 besser82	sonne|work: the warning is always there  ;)
 sonne|work	it looks all ok there ^^
 besser82	sonne|work:  same test report that on py2, too  ;)  "multiclass/MulticlassStrategy.cpp line 45: MulticlassStrategy::CMulticlassStrategy(): register parameters!"
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah but that is not an error
 besser82	sonne|work:  i know, but the previous RESULT-logic made it one  ;)
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	they all passed
 besser82	sonne|work:  sine it only tested "IF(RESULT)"
 sonne|work	but now it doesn't work at all
 besser82	sonne|work:  which was actually an effect of that b0rken RESULT logic  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  because now I trigger a FATAL_ERROR in cmake to get /usr/bin/cmake to exit(1) if there was sth.  that made IF(RESULT) == true
 besser82	sonne|work: which would be the case on `garbage` output
 besser82	sonne|work: so i enhaced that logic with a REGEX MATCH

 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work, wiking: like da data-structures from modshogun
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work, wiking: one can unpickle, but don't get useful data ---> SEGFAULT
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work, wiking: as that SEGFAULT definetively comes from modshogun reconstructor...
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work, wiking: that bin-incompat is known and stuff like numpy-arrays are affected as well...
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work, wiking: but that acutally lives in the nature of pickles  :(

@wiking	besser82: i thought it's an easy fix
 besser82	wiking:  loading / upickling that shiats, yes
 besser82	wiking:  patching python2 / python3 to keep bin-compat no  :-P
@wiking	yeah, i knew
 besser82	wiking:  at least for more than the half of the integrationtests it works that way  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  so the easy fix "repairs" 101/190 failing intergr test

 besser82	lisitsyn:  good luck!
 lisitsyn	thanks
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Heavily involved in getting Python3-support for da shogunzzzz
 lisitsyn	besser82: cool, I see quite a lot of troubles here?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  the most annoying shiatz is about da binary-incompat of pickles with numpy && modshogun structures
@sonney2k	besser82, hey there
@sonney2k	besser82, is the ascii aka level 0 pickle protocol compatible?
