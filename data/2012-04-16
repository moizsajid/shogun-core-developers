 blackburn	uricamic: are you familiar with libocas?
 uricamic	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	uricamic: can it solve the following slightly modified problem:
 blackburn	||w||^2 + w0 w + ..?
 blackburn	w0 is obtained before so can be considerd as constant vector
 blackburn	I am lame with it :D
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@157.159.42.154] has joined #shogun
 uricamic	well I will look at it, but I am afraid that it cannot be used for that
 uricamic	blackburn: the .. in your question means the rest of the original equation in OCAS solver?
 blackburn	uricamic: yes sure
 blackburn	uricamic: actually I'm interested in something similar to crammer-singer
 blackburn	so even \sum_m ||w_m||^2 + \sum w_m w0_m + C \sum_i \xi_i
 blackburn	s.t. <w_yi,x_i> - <w_m,x_i> <= 1 - \delta_{yi,m} - \xi_i
 uricamic	blackburn: ok, in that case I think you cannot use libocas without modification, the additional w term will change the dual function
 blackburn	I hope it is parseaable
 blackburn	uricamic: hmm is libocas a dual solver?
 uricamic	I think it is

 uricamic	blackburn: sorry my mistake, it is
 blackburn	why I am asking is I am curious how hard it would be to modify it
 uricamic	blackburn: I am looking on the libocas.cpp code now, and it looks that e.g. in svm_ocas_solver it uses dual function
 uricamic	it calls libqp_splx_solver and computes the wights of alpha
 blackburn	you are right
 uricamic	*weights
 blackburn	that's all confusing
 uricamic	and the transformation to the primal objective function is done in compute_W, which uses this alpha

 blackburn	totally DEADLY today
 blackburn	n4nd0: what's up?
 n4nd0	blackburn: bah, not much, boring day so far
 n4nd0	blackburn: what about you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: totally BORING
 blackburn	I guess it is the time to rename shogun
 n4nd0	really? to what?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I preferred CCCP
 n4nd0	that stands for?
 blackburn	n4nd0: USSR
 blackburn	back in back in
 blackburn	back in USSR
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	back to black maybe :P
 blackburn	n4nd0: it seems you are not the biggest fan of beatles :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: probably not, but I like them quite much :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: why so?
 blackburn	n4nd0: they had this song :)

 emrecelikten	Hello all
 blackburn	uricamic: is there any speedup with GS?
 uricamic	blackburn: it depends on the size of kernel matrix, I think
 blackburn	uricamic: sure with large kernel matrix pinv wouldn't work at all :)
 uricamic	I have also tried variant which will not compute the whole kernel matrix, but it was very slow
 blackburn	really?
 uricamic	well, maybe I haven't done that in the most clever way
 blackburn	ah you need each element there
 uricamic	I took the row of matrix in each step, but I think that this allocation and freeing of memory is killing the performance
 blackburn	uricamic: how many iterations it requires?
 wiking	uricamic: hey i was wondering if you'll have some times this week to have a chat about the integration of libqp into shogun
 uricamic	depends on the epsilon and also on the initialization
 uricamic	wiking: libqp?
 uricamic	wiking: I thought it is already there
 wiking	well it's a very immature integration
 uricamic	blackburn: I will try to think about this GS for KRR, maybe it can be simplified which could bring some performance increase
 uricamic	wiking: ok
 wiking	and afaik you'll use it in your bmrm , or?
 uricamic	wiking: yep, I am using it there
 wiking	yeah and i'm planning to use it in my latent svm implementation
 wiking	thus maybe if you have some time we could have a little chat about the libqp integration into shogun
 uricamic	wiking: sure, I will be on IRC all this week, I think
 wiking	cool
 wiking	maybe then tomorrow
 wiking	today is not the best for me
 uricamic	sure, neither for me, I am leaving soon
 uricamic	so tommorow in the morning or afternoon?
 blackburn	that day is totally boriinggggg
 wiking	uricamic: morning means for you?
 wiking	i mean for me tomorrow before noon around 10am would be fine
 uricamic	after 9am
 uricamic	ok
 wiking	ok cool, so how about 10am?
 wiking	cool
 wiking	i'll be around
 wiking	thnx a lot!
 uricamic	I hope we have the same timezone :D
 wiking	yep
 wiking	you are from .cz right?
 uricamic	yep
 uricamic	ok, fine :)
 wiking	diky
 uricamic	neni zac :D
 wiking	yeah about this is my level of czech ... i think i could order some beers as well ;P
 wiking	dva piva? ;0
 blackburn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/450 what would you say about my last comment?
 uricamic	*dve
 blackburn	sound like russian
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	it's different then a bit
 blackburn	dva piva is totally correct russian
 wiking	hahah yeah i think serbian is closer to russian
 wiking	;)
 uricamic	all of these are quite similar
 blackburn	however dve butylki vodki would make it more russian
 wiking	blackburn: i'll check the comment just a sec
 wiking	uricamic: yeps
 blackburn	uricamic: are you able to understand russian then? ;)
 wiking	uricamic: this is how i survive when i'm in .cz ;)
 uricamic	whenever I hear some russian counting I feel like hearing czech :)
 uricamic	blackburn: only a little
 blackburn	my friend studying in cz teached me how to count in czech
 blackburn	however I do not remember that :(
 uricamic	for example some words are completely the same, but some have exactly the opposite meaning :)
 blackburn	uricamic: how does it sound like?
 wiking	for sure they understand: jedan, dva, tri, cetri, pet....
 wiking	;)
 wiking	maybe there's an -i on the end ;P
 uricamic	jeden, dva, tri, ctyri, pet
 wiking	see it's very similar :)
 blackburn	odin dva try chetyre pyat schest sem' vosem' devyat'
 wiking	blackburn: your problem is with how to find out the size of an array?
 blackburn	wiking: it is not a problem of mine ;)
 uricamic	counting for sure, but for example word "voni" has the exactly opposite meaning in russian than in czech :)
 blackburn	wiking: do you agree it *can't* work at all?
 wiking	i mean this should be fine: sizeof(vec)/sizeof(variable that the array is made of)
 blackburn	uricamic: voni? some smells?
 wiking	that's totally legal in ansi c
 uricamic	in czech it means that something smells nice, and in russian it means that somethins smells badly
 blackburn	uricamic: yeap
 wiking	of course you'll start having troubles
 blackburn	wiking: I am afraid it would not work still
 wiking	it will
 wiking	except if it's a pointer
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	it is
 blackburn	http://pastebin.com/VYvPnkiP
 blackburn	it would work only for static allocated arrays afaik
 wiking	yeah as said pointers will make you feel bad ;)
 wiking	since you'll get back the pointer size
 blackburn	so zero length alway
 blackburn	s
 wiking	no pointer size = 4 or 8
 wiking	depends on the arch
 blackburn	ah nevertheless it is not correct
 wiking	yes with pointer you'll have troubles
 wiking	and this syntax is anyways bogus
 wiking	(sizeof array)/sizeof(int);
 wiking	it should be like sizeof(array)/sizeof(int)
 wiking	if
 wiking	;)
 wiking	blackburn: you can check your fav help as well, i.e. stack overflow; quote: "It is worth noting that sizeof doesn't help if you are dealing with a pointer to an array:"
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.246.67] has joined #shogun
 wiking	and of course the other problem here is what if you change your function arg in the future
 blackburn	wiking: hah why stack overflow is my fav help?
 wiking	blackburn: just joking ;)
 wiking	anyhow if in future you make a function arg type change you are (not you but any 3rd person) most likely going to forget to change the type in  /sizeof(.)
 wiking	so you'll end up with a bad vector size obviously
 wiking	so it's far from being safe
 blackburn	wiking: I was really surprised to see that here
 wiking	much better to pass the vector size via the function arg, as anywhere else in shogun ;P
 blackburn	I mean this way of obtaining a size of array
 wiking	blackburn: yeah this is a dirty hack from ansi c ;)
 harshit_	blackburn: how can I make my current fork exactly same as upstream, I don't want to rebase I want to get to the current state of upstream master
 wiking	blackburn: it works until you work on the stack... as soon as you start using the heap you'll have problems
 blackburn	wiking: in my example it is on stack but doesn't work
 blackburn	harshit_: why don't you want to rebase?
-!- ishaanmlhtr [~chatzilla@101.63.121.9] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	I have made some changes in my fork that I want to delete ..
 wiking	blackburn: true that :)
 blackburn	harshit_: did you commit it then?
 harshit_	yeah :(
 harshit_	so do I need to delete my current fork
 harshit_	and fork again ?
 blackburn	no you can reset your state and push with --force
 harshit_	reset ?? how to do that ?
 blackburn	harshit_: something like git reset --hard upstream/HEAD
 blackburn	wiking: am I right?
 wiking	blackburn: yeah
 wiking	harshit_: have you commit?
 blackburn	he did
 wiking	i mean your code
 wiking	into your own branch
 harshit_	wiking: yeah I have commit some changes
 wiking	aaaah
 wiking	well then it's a bit tricky
 blackburn	wiking: I can't see any other way but hard reset and force push
 wiking	since you'll repo is going to be a bit fucked up with you do a rebase
 wiking	wh
 wiking	blackburn: you can remove commites
 wiking	*commits
 blackburn	wiking: how?
 wiking	just you need to do a rebase
 wiking	which is usually a pain in the ass
 wiking	if somebody is following your repo
 harshit_	why not delete and fork again ?
 blackburn	harshit_: yes it is the simplest way
 wiking	it's simple :)
 harshit_	:)
 wiking	blackburn: yours would do that
 wiking	git reset --hard upstream/HEAD
 wiking	that'd remove the commits
 blackburn	not really remove but jump to another state
 wiking	and what happens with the prev commits? :)
 wiking	i mean that are after HEAD?
 blackburn	wiking: hmm are they really deleted from index?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	you'll never get those commits back
 wiking	unless you've saved them somewhere... other branch or somethin
 blackburn	but can't you access it by sha1?
 wiking	not in that branch no
 blackburn	wiking: it seems we spend days solving puzzles
 wiking	:D

@sonney2k	uricamic, how many iterations does GS need to get eps precision?
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.246.67] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am afraid he is afk
 blackburn	(as he told he is leaving)
 uricamic	sonney2k: I am still here
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	that's nice then
 uricamic	I am now working on your comments
 uricamic	but I will have to leave soon
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah I guess so too... I've studied his code and I guess it needs some kernel caching routines to be fast w/ GS
 blackburn	sonney2k: here already
@sonney2k	blackburn, unfortunately we don't have that in CKernel ... we only have crappy svmlight kernel cache business there
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean uricamic is here
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	so we in fact need one general solution that one can use with distances etc too
 blackburn	but yes I agree we need nice caching
@sonney2k	uricamic, hey
 uricamic	sonney2k: I am working on the comments
 uricamic	sonney2k: then I will do the benchmarks
 blackburn	sonney2k: someone could do that while gsocing may be ;)
@sonney2k	uricamic, so any idea how many GS iterations you need?
 uricamic	sonney2k: I haven't measure it in this implementation, but when I was trying my first implementation in MATLAB it was around 700 for eps=1e-5
@sonney2k	uricamic, that is all I wanted to know - ok then you will need some kind of cache and clever strategy / way to iterate over examples for this to be any fast then
 uricamic	sonney2k: yes
 uricamic	I really have to go now, see you

 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	I can adapt my timezone if necessary :P
@sonney2k	we are basically dead already because we have one mentor in NY
@sonney2k	and one in melbourne
@sonney2k	and some spread inbetween
@sonney2k	so it is like either the NY guys suffer or the ozzies
 n4nd0	sonney2k: who is the mentor in NY?
@sonney2k	christian widmer
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	UTC 11 hrs or 12hrs seems to be the only viable time
@sonney2k	well in one week the officially accepted students will be announced
@sonney2k	so we should have some kickoff meeting that informs about how things work and they way we want them to work :)
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: by the way, one doubt about JL's cover tree
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so when m_q != 1, since the cover tree doesn't output the neighbors ordered by distance
 n4nd0	it would be required to compute the distance to the k neighbors and sort them
 n4nd0	something similar to what is done in the method to classify for different k
 n4nd0	when you said on github
 n4nd0	"I would just speed up the most common q=1 case with the covertree."
 n4nd0	do you mean that this computation of the distances and sorting shouldn't be done right?
 n4nd0	i.e. no cover tree + m_q != 1
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am not sure what you are saying
@sonney2k	I meant m_q !=1 -> no cover tree
 n4nd0	haha ok
@sonney2k	slow
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	but if you want to do the sorting - feel free :)

 blackburn	gsomix: yeah some vodka stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know they reject any work which title has no 'vodka' word?
@sonney2k	I knew it!
 gsomix	it's time to become a physicist. no optics! T____T
@sonney2k	someone named vodking told me!
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: my bachelor's work is title
 blackburn	support vodka machine recognition
 blackburn	titled*
 blackburn	SVM
 blackburn	I wish it was vector but they forced me to call it support vodka machine
@sonney2k	vodka really is the key to everything...
@sonney2k	without vodka R.I.P.
@sonney2k	no fun, no gsoc, no shogun, no theorems, no kernels, no support vodka machines!
 blackburn	you catch things
@sonney2k	yeah I am fast in this
@sonney2k	that's because we had a brewing seminar for x-mas party at tomtom
@sonney2k	and you know once your blood got replaced by vodka there is nothing to worry about!
 blackburn	sonney2k: heh
 gsomix	blackburn, should I offer vodka to my future supervisor?
 blackburn	gsomix: to sobolev?
 gsomix	yep
 blackburn	he seems to not be a big fan of it
 gsomix	:(
 blackburn	gsomix: consider kolomiets for that
 n4nd0	does that work in Russia, to buy things for the teachers?
 gsomix	blackburn, ohoho.
 n4nd0	some friends tried it once in my school (for real!) but it didn't work
 blackburn	n4nd0: to get exam passed?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, for example
 blackburn	yes pretty often unfortunately
 blackburn	mostly money however
 n4nd0	the story in my university is quite fun actually
 n4nd0	they put a serrano on the hood of the car
 blackburn	n4nd0: half of my group at univ bribed teacher to get physics passed
 blackburn	6000 roubles = 200$ each
 n4nd0	and went to the office with more stuff
 gsomix	blackburn, congac (brandy) for Alimenkov
 blackburn	ha
 blackburn	n4nd0: did it work?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no
 blackburn	n4nd0: as for your very first question
 blackburn	it works to bribe anyone in russia
 blackburn	it is just a matter of different cost ;)
 n4nd0	haha I see
 n4nd0	I actually shouldn't laugh, sad thing indeed
 blackburn	n4nd0: police there tends to put a bottle in your ass if they don't like you :D
 blackburn	I am not joking
 blackburn	three cases recently one has died
 gsomix	blackburn, brrr >__< this story...
 n4nd0	:O
 n4nd0	for real? hard to believe
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am not saying you're lying, that could be misunderstood :S
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes in kazan'
 blackburn	they put a bottle of champagne right to the ass
 n4nd0	not good
 gsomix	blackburn, horror stories about Russia
 blackburn	hah why not

 gsomix	blackburn, I sleep badly, hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: remember you said to come up with some paper sounds like something good?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 emrecelikten	I think one of you guys recommended a good dataset website before, what was it?
 n4nd0	very good actually
 blackburn	emrecelikten: mldata.org
 emrecelikten	blackburn: Yep, that's it. Thanks
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think it would be hard and time consuming to come up with strong journal article
 n4nd0	blackburn: why?
 blackburn	however there is arxiv still
 blackburn	and we could place some kind of paper there :)
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I didn't know about arxiv
 blackburn	hmm it is openaccess and rather easy reviewed
 blackburn	so you won't be rejected because this paper does no revolution in SO :)
 n4nd0	yeah sure, it could be a nice place to start with
 blackburn	I would be happy to collaborate later on that
 n4nd0	blackburn: :)
 n4nd0	it looks that they not require the common format with two columns of text per page
 n4nd0	blackburn: by the way, did you or any of you blog about gsoc last year?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	I actually do not think it is so useful though
 n4nd0	I think it is a good idea
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about adv ourselves and shogun using arXiv? :)
 blackburn	and blogs
@sonney2k	well we have a meta-blog
 blackburn	yours?
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/planet/
@sonney2k	everyone that wants to be on it - send me the url
@sonney2k	and voila
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	and please regularly write something
@sonney2k	I am damn lazy so I won't write more than once a year or so
@sonney2k	crazy .. .https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/
* sonney2k gets tired
 blackburn	sonney2k: and what about arxiv stuff?
@sonney2k	blackburn, publish as much as you want :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: hrr I am asking whether it is a good idea
@sonney2k	blackburn, depends what you want to achieve...
@sonney2k	if you want to become professor it is worth nothing
 blackburn	sonney2k: me? professor?
@sonney2k	but to e.g. apply to something related to ML (also research) it can help
@sonney2k	blackburn, you drink vodka so you qualify
 blackburn	don't you think I am too stupid^W programmer to be a professor?
@sonney2k	and you know the 'dawai dawai rabotatch' slogan pretty well
 blackburn	finally you said that
@sonney2k	wellyou have to stop programming of course and let your slaves^H^H^Hstudents to this
 blackburn	sonney2k: no seriously no chance
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but now, while we are studying, isn't it a good idea to do some programming job to become professor in the future?
 blackburn	brb
 n4nd0	I meant job, like work or collaboration as we do here

@sonney2k	n4nd0, all profs did real work at some point - they started out as researchers, group leaders, ...
@sonney2k	so yes it helps + you need to slowly become some kind of leader (like backburn :D
@sonney2k	hey karlnapf
 karlnapf	sonney2k, hi there
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thank you :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, good to catch you, wanted to talk about subsets once more
 karlnapf	I am currently working on moving all the stack stuff to a separate class
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.246.67] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 karlnapf	which does everything, instead of doing this by hand in every class
 karlnapf	sonney2k, I think this should solve all subset stuff once and for all
 karlnapf	I think it will also be possible to migrate the old plain Subsets into that new system
-!- PhilTillet [9d9f0a0e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.157.159.10.14] has joined #shogun
 PhilTillet	Hello
 karlnapf	hi
@sonney2k	karlnapf, sounds great
@sonney2k	(as usual)
 karlnapf	it will also be easier than its now
@sonney2k	I guess you should just do it then and I can only hope that you are only 150% overloaded :)
 karlnapf	tell me about it :)
 karlnapf	Well I cannot compete with you?
 karlnapf	ehm not ? ,  !
 karlnapf	what about you and your family? are things getting more relaxed?
@sonney2k	I can sleep at night now!
@sonney2k	(since about the week before easter)
@sonney2k	and that is a big big big +
@sonney2k	which reminds me
@sonney2k	I should really sleep now
@sonney2k	karlnapf, nice talking to you if only briefly
@sonney2k	cu
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok enjoy :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: hey there
 karlnapf	blackburn, hi, how is russia? ;)
-!- nickon [~noneedtok@kotnet-147.kulnet.kuleuven.be] has quit [Quit: ( www.nnscript.com :: NoNameScript 4.22 :: www.esnation.com )]
 blackburn	karlnapf: stays the same I guess
 blackburn	karlnapf: btw I had some crazy thought
 karlnapf	blackburn, tell me
 blackburn	what if I write some things to you in german and you will check/correct it? :D
 karlnapf	you wanna learn German?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I know you are busy so 'no' would be ok too ;)
 karlnapf	nice, I like that.
 karlnapf	Well what about in June?
 blackburn	yes sure
 karlnapf	after my exams?
 blackburn	deal
 karlnapf	Then I am happy to help you
 karlnapf	I encourage everybody in learning German :)
 karlnapf	why you want to do that?
 blackburn	karlnapf: I could help you with russian if you want
 blackburn	karlnapf: I want to visit deutschland and probably stay there
 karlnapf	Would be an idea, but thats probably not before winter, to much stuff to do before
 karlnapf	really?
 karlnapf	any concrete plans?
 blackburn	and damn you are all germans
 blackburn	no but may be chris would call me to be his phd, who knows? ;)
 karlnapf	oh cool :)
 karlnapf	maybe we will meet then
 karlnapf	I am applying to the MPI
 blackburn	heh who knows again
 blackburn	it would be useful anyway
 blackburn	karlnapf: to talk is the only way I guess
 karlnapf	yes indeed.
 blackburn	less or more you now understand my english and should work for german
 karlnapf	yeah you will get that
 karlnapf	and you had it in school so should be easy
 blackburn	it was pretty bad in school
 karlnapf	mmh, but now you have me correcting you :(
 karlnapf	:8
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	I have known more from rammstein songs than from school
 karlnapf	hehe
 karlnapf	rammstein
 karlnapf	crazy guys
 karlnapf	once saw them live
 karlnapf	fire all over the place
 blackburn	it is easy to distinguish their german words for me
 karlnapf	but nobody talks like them here ;)
 blackburn	yes I hope so
 blackburn	and actually their songs are about some crazy shit
 blackburn	I was pretty surprised translated zwitter
 blackburn	karlnapf: eins, zwei, drei, fier, f?nf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, zehn, zw?lf!
 blackburn	I know that
 karlnapf	vier
 blackburn	ohh
 karlnapf	and zehn elf zw?lf :)
 blackburn	hahahah
 blackburn	95%
 blackburn	karlnapf: v as f is a bit confusing
 blackburn	v?gel
 karlnapf	yeah many people confuse these
 karlnapf	btw it owuldnt be too bad if you would start learning it here
 karlnapf	I think many people in t?bingen talk english all day
 karlnapf	Arthur Gretton was there a few years and cannot speak German
 blackburn	karlnapf: ah yes but I am rather curious than planning something
 blackburn	it is always useful to speak diff langs
 karlnapf	yea true
 karlnapf	very nice for traveling
 karlnapf	I want to get into more languages some time
 n4nd0	good night guys
 blackburn	n4nd0: see you!
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 blackburn	karlnapf: are you applying for Phd at MPI?
 karlnapf	n4nd0, good night
 karlnapf	blackburn, yes I think I will do that in a few month
 karlnapf	(among other places)
 blackburn	karlnapf: but what about gretton?
 karlnapf	also an idea
 blackburn	I thought you are going to work with him
 karlnapf	but I can only apply in Dec 2012
 karlnapf	for Sept 2013
 karlnapf	pretty late
 karlnapf	but perhaps there is a way of bridging this gap
 karlnapf	dont really know yet
 karlnapf	I wrote to some people
 karlnapf	but I want to concentrate on my work currently, thats more important
 blackburn	karlnapf: I see
 gsomix	good night, guys
 blackburn	another one bites the dust
 karlnapf	gsomix, gn8
 karlnapf	hehe ;)
 blackburn	gsomix: spokoynoy drochi!
 gsomix	blackburn, :3
 blackburn	uh that's kind of hard to understand joke
 blackburn	karlnapf: so you want to do bioinf?
 blackburn	everybody does this thing :D
 karlnapf	blackburn, mmmh I was a bit more sure about this a year ago
 blackburn	but actually only in shogun neighborhood probably
 karlnapf	currently I am more interested in kernel stuff and bayesian stuff
 karlnapf	but who knows
 karlnapf	this MMD thing might be a nice direction
 blackburn	whoa I always hated that bayesian stuff
 blackburn	networks, etc
 karlnapf	optimization, kernels, statistics
 karlnapf	I kind of like the gaussian processes
 blackburn	probably this is because I do not understand it well
 karlnapf	which is just bayesian linear regression in the feeature space
 blackburn	karlnapf: yeah it seems a lot of people like GPs
 blackburn	chris does afaik
 karlnapf	no surprise, they are quite recent
 karlnapf	and really cool
 karlnapf	not cool for large scale stuff
 karlnapf	at least out of the box
 karlnapf	I havent tried them with some kernel matrix approximation
 blackburn	karlnapf: is it only for regression? are classification results so well too?
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	check out this book by carl rasmussen
 karlnapf	awesome
 karlnapf	currently studying this stuff for exams
 blackburn	I've glanced over it before
 karlnapf	I fell there is so much stuff
 karlnapf	have no idea how to decide on anything
 karlnapf	but probably thats handled by the people one konws
 karlnapf	knows
 blackburn	karlnapf: I just realized that I will suggest to study GPs to my gf
 karlnapf	what???
 blackburn	she was excited about random processes studies
 karlnapf	lol, she likes that?
 blackburn	yes but not very familiar with ML still
 blackburn	her bachelor's work is about multiclass svms
 karlnapf	hehe, funny, you are a ML couple
 blackburn	but she doesn't like it so much
 blackburn	I have to mentor this while professors here are lame idiots
 karlnapf	lol
 wiking	yeeey i have a competitor !
 karlnapf	you cannot escape the ML then
 blackburn	karlnapf: why?
 blackburn	wiking: which?
 karlnapf	blackburn, just joking
 wiking	blackburn: saw the mails on shogun mailing list for latent svm
 karlnapf	wiking, whats happening=?
 blackburn	karlnapf: but I didn't get the joke :D
 karlnapf	well you work all day on ML stuff and then you return home and continue working on ML stuff, and then youre talking about ML stuff in bed :D
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	karlnapf: I wish I was working on ML
 karlnapf	what are you currently doing?
 blackburn	karlnapf: working at netcracker and studying some crazy shit
 blackburn	but I am going to finish with both activities
 blackburn	i.e. leave job for summer and pass exams :D
 karlnapf	nice
 blackburn	karlnapf: I am pretty tired with development in such huge company
 karlnapf	why?
 blackburn	for example oneliner fix took a week recently
 blackburn	just because of being "enterprise"/size/etc
 karlnapf	oh that sucks
 blackburn	karlnapf: another example is just what I do
 karlnapf	I am currently a bit annoyed by studying for exams .... so much stuff
 blackburn	e.g. today I fixed backpropagation of component associations related to component instances with vertical links while decomposing two service orders
 karlnapf	ich verstehe nur Bahnhof
 blackburn	you understand ...
 karlnapf	"I understand just train-station" means: I dont understand anything ;)
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	karlnapf: that is the problem
 blackburn	I used to learn stuff that makes no sense in outer world
 karlnapf	how do you mean that?
 blackburn	I've learnt nothing but some netcracker-specific stuff
 karlnapf	oh
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	but you always train your mind when you do this
 blackburn	I wouldn't say so
 karlnapf	jipiie my shogun compiles again
 blackburn	you are right it is not harmful
 blackburn	but not very useful
 karlnapf	well its soon over :)
 karlnapf	blackburn, I have to leave now
 blackburn	yeah I prefer to full-time in gsoc
 blackburn	ok
 karlnapf	gf wants to have a tea :)
 karlnapf	take care and good night!
 blackburn	hah yeah
 blackburn	good night
 karlnapf	 :) bye

 wiking	anybody knows in latex what to do when your limits for sum are not really under and above the sum sign?
 wiking	ah ok it's \limits
 blackburn	wiking: not really under??
 wiking	$\sum_{a=1}^n$
 wiking	it will be not the same as $\sum\limits_{a=1}^n$
 blackburn	while it is inlined it would be compact
 blackburn	there is a way to force \limits there
 blackburn	some option IIRC
