@sonney2k	van51, btw have you seen ProductKernel?
@sonney2k	it is the same like COmbinedKernel but using products and some other stuff internally
@sonney2k	so also Lists :/
 van51	sonney2k: hehe, I feel like a CList exterminator :P
 van51	sonney2k: btw, I want to ask you about a method
@sonney2k	ask
@sonney2k	now
 van51	CCombinedFeatures::get_size(), uses internally the notion of the current_object
@sonney2k	before I fall asleep
 van51	hehe
@sonney2k	get_size()
@sonney2k	???
 van51	but I don't see it used anywhere
 van51	yea
@sonney2k	no one is using this
@sonney2k	:qa
 van51	so I'll just override it and return the first element's size
@sonney2k	or whatever
@sonney2k	it should be dropped altogether from CFeatures and below
 van51	hmm
 van51	this could be my next bug
 van51	I'm optimistic that by morning you 'll have a PR waiting for you :)
@sonney2k	I guess when you ask more questions more stuff pops up
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	would be nice
@sonney2k	but do compare again against the octave example
@sonney2k	and don't forget about the unit test
 van51	yea I have it in my mind
@sonney2k	(not necessarily now but this really helpful)
@sonney2k	alright I better ZZzzzz....
@sonney2k	cu
 van51	cyaa
@sonney2k	(I need to be in good shape for the CR tomorrow ;)
@sonney2k	yours I mean :)
 van51	what's CR a shorthand for? :P
