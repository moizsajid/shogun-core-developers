 n4nd0	so is there any way to build a strong classifier with shogun where several "weak" ones are put together?
 n4nd0	I am looking for it to work on an example application on face detection
 n4nd0	I have made tests using fancy features but no good results using svm with a polynomial kernel
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we don't have boosting if you mean that
@sonney2k	try multiboost for that
 n4nd0	sonney2k, I was looking for an alternative solution to boosting
 n4nd0	I want to stick to shogun
 n4nd0	sonney2k, about boosting, I have seen in the gsoc ideas page that one of the suggested projects last year was to merge shogun and multiboost
@sonney2k	no longer there ...
@sonney2k	too ambitious
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	but would that still be of interest for shogun?
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	alright ... sleep time!
@sonney2k	cu
 n4nd0	sonney2k, I have worked with adaboost in particular before
 n4nd0	so I could start taking a look to multiboost and try to see how could that be ported to shogun
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	good night

 blackburn	wiking: have you tried 1/2-homogay map?
 blackburn	vedaldi surprisingly reported improvement with this
 wiking	what's 1/2-hkm?
 blackburn	wiking: order of homogaynit
 blackburn	y
 blackburn	I mean they use 1/2 as order
 blackburn	and it smooths things
 blackburn	but I got worse results
 wiking	but how can he do 1/2 order
 wiking	when it's an int in their implementation
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	not order
 blackburn	gamma
 blackburn	my bad
 blackburn	k(cx,cy) = c^\gamma k(x,y)
 blackburn	wiking: using 0.5 for JS improved for 1%
 blackburn	on my data
 blackburn	hog
 wiking	aha
 wiking	compared to original JS?
 wiking	or compared to 1.0 gamma ;P
 wiking	i'm gonna introduce a new kernel today/tomorrow
 wiking	and let's see if i can make that HKM as well
 blackburn	wiking: JS with gamma = 1.0 and JS with gamma = 0.5
 blackburn	btw it is pretty dirty hack
 blackburn	for me
 blackburn	wiking: jenson-shannon-renyi-mozart?
 wiking	which? :)
 wiking	ahahah yepp
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: hmm what is the natural gamma for JS btw?
 wiking	none
 wiking	i mean this is like basically a tailor series
 wiking	so it's just approximation
 wiking	so i guess gamma -> inf would get you to original JS
 blackburn	hmm
 wiking	Smaller value of @f$ \gamma @f$ enhance the kernel non-linearity and
 wiking	are sometimes beneficial in applications
 blackburn	I guess your suggestion about gamma -> inf wasn't right
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	gamma -> inf makes it LINEAR :)
 wiking	and is says that
 blackburn	or something like that
 blackburn	oh I don't like it
 blackburn	makes more params :(
 wiking	if gamma = 1 then u should obtain the standard kernels
 wiking	the order ->inf would do that what i'm saying
 wiking	i mean yeah as it says here
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	The homogeneous kernel map
 wiking	approximation is based on periodicizing the kernel
 wiking	so basically you could see this
 wiking	or at least i would see this as sampling the signal
 wiking	and then u have there the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem
 wiking	and basically period is the sampling rate
 wiking	imho
 blackburn	pretty complex huh
 blackburn	but yeah I catch it
 blackburn	wiking: where are you doing your phd btw?
 wiking	gent, belgium
 wiking	yesterday i've found a fucking paper that partially implements that idea i had lately
 wiking	it'll be published next month
 wiking	fuckers... from stanford..
 blackburn	hah that fucked up feeling
 blackburn	so you are a big traveller :)
 blackburn	wiking: will you have enough time for doing latent svms this summer?
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	nice
 wiking	i'll be in iceland for a month in july
 wiking	doing nothing
 blackburn	iceland??
 wiking	yeah i was living quite around this world...
 blackburn	I wish I did the same haha
 wiking	nevertoolate
 blackburn	notenoughmoney
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	u think i had ? :P
 wiking	anyhow
 wiking	there's this thingy
 blackburn	will you live in a box?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	http://www.pascal-network.org/?q=node/19
 wiking	i think it's a good idea, and shogun could apply for it
 wiking	the only problem is that the program is running out and they don't know if there's going to be a last call for participation or not...
 wiking	they going to decide it on the end of march
 wiking	and then with this you could travel
 wiking	;)
 wiking	ok i'm off now
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	nice program
 wiking	i'll be back sometime at night
 blackburn	but no idea how to apply it for shogun
 blackburn	ok
 wiking	it's easy
 blackburn	I mean we can hardly find 4-8 guye
 blackburn	guys
 wiking	nono
 wiking	easy
 wiking	you are one
 wiking	:>
 wiking	anyhow i'll let you know if they are going to be a last call for participation
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	e.g. Soeren can't participate in this program
 wiking	ttyl

 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	sonne|work: http://www.pascal-network.org/?q=node/19 is it any applicable to shogun?
 blackburn	hm I forgot it is saturday
 blackburn	:D

-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.96.26.93] has joined #shogun
 Ram108	blackburn: there?
 blackburn	Ram108: yes
 Ram108	hi i think i figured out what went wrong.........
 Ram108	well the weight vectors were initialised to large values and the error equation yielded very small values to change the weight vectors appropriately
 Ram108	thanks for the help..........
 blackburn	hah, did I help you anyhow? :)
 Ram108	lol
 Ram108	erm do u mind i ask u hw long were u in this field of work?
 Ram108	i mean machine learning
 blackburn	hmm
 Ram108	i am not able to grasp what all topics does this field comprise off
 blackburn	more than year
 blackburn	may be 1.5
 Ram108	oh hmmm thanks :)
 Ram108	well NN, SVM, fuzzy logic, Genetic algorithms
 Ram108	is that about it?
 Ram108	i mean do all the learning algorithms fall under one of these?
 blackburn	NN + SVM mainly
 blackburn	genetic stuff stands apart usually
 blackburn	more generally, evolutionary computing
 blackburn	fuzzy logic as well
 Ram108	oh hmmm okay.........
 blackburn	but there are a lot of intersections everywhere
 Ram108	ah........
 blackburn	shogun contains svms mainly
 Ram108	i can see that lol
 Ram108	thats perhaps why am not able to understand all the liblinear lib...... etc etc
 Ram108	i ll read up on that......
 Ram108	by the way could u enlighten me more on what Mr sonney is doing?
 blackburn	I don't know, he does some research at tomtom
 blackburn	earlier he was related to bioinformatics
 Ram108	oh hmmm i c....... and he devout s rest of his spare time building shogun?
 blackburn	yes
 Ram108	ok :) last one....... hw old is shogun?
 blackburn	since 1999
 Ram108	thanks :)

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi! so about what we talked a bit yesterday of adding boosting to shogun
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I would like to first start with adaboost, what do you think it is a good start to do it?
 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: hey
 wiking	wazza
 wiking	are we getting multiclass linear sum soon?
 wiking	*svm
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	yes, I'm working on it
 blackburn	although not very fast
 wiking	ok cool
 wiking	that'd be great to see the speedup
 blackburn	yeah liblinear with cramer singer should be fast and accurate
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you know sth about multiboost and the gsoc project that was suggested last year porting it to shogun?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, unfortunately no
 n4nd0	blackburn: I started thinking of it since I don't see other way of making the face detector work :(
 blackburn	do you need a face detector?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have tried with some fancy haar features for a single svm but no luck
 blackburn	did you get better results with boosting?
 n4nd0	blackburn: well, not really ... it was more with the idea of making this example we talked about
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes, with the implementation from scratch I did in matlab with boosting of weak classifiers it worked
 blackburn	what are the numbers?
 blackburn	if you really need boosting you may work on it, else it is okay to show bad results
 blackburn	bad results are results as well right?
 n4nd0	haha yes they are
 n4nd0	in any case it could be nice try to get into shogun some of the algorithms in multiboost
 n4nd0	blackburn: or do you think it might be too optimistic to do let say in a couple of non-intense weeks?
 blackburn	n4nd0: Soeren said it is pretty ambitious
 blackburn	did he?
 n4nd0	he referred to the gsoc project that was proposed last year, but yes he said that
 n4nd0	I had in mind anyway to limit to adaboost firstly
 n4nd0	these are the parameters of the classifiers I get using a single svm in the CBCL database
 n4nd0	>>>> accuracy   = 0.932669322709
 n4nd0	>>>> precision  = 0.985507246377
 n4nd0	>>>> error rate = 0.0673306772908
 n4nd0	>>>> recall     = 0.28813559322
 n4nd0	>>>> ROC area   = 0.907626093794
 n4nd0	recall is too low
 blackburn	what are results with your boosting?
 n4nd0	I didn't try it with this database
 blackburn	ehmm how then can you compare :)
 n4nd0	because we could use that classifier "for real", not in real time though
 n4nd0	but it worked nicely with images
 n4nd0	and, even if I have not tried the svm with real images, with a recall of about 0.288 I don't think it will work fine
 blackburn	I just wonder if recall is calculated correctly
 blackburn	hmm seems so
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you try kernels?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have used a polynomial one
 blackburn	gaussian? sigmoid?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have tried it with degree 2 and 3
 n4nd0	no, I have not tried other ones
 blackburn	why?
 n4nd0	in the page where I got the CBCL face data I read they had used those kernels and not others
 blackburn	heh
 n4nd0	I assumed those were the best for this application
 n4nd0	but it might be that they improve
 n4nd0	let me try
 blackburn	well gaussian works well usually
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw did you change C?
 blackburn	normalization?
 blackburn	these things are considerable steps
 n4nd0	currently I am using a value of 1.0 for C
 n4nd0	I tried changing it to bigger ones but it went worse
 n4nd0	do you mean normalization for the training and test data?
 blackburn	yes, both should be normalized
 n4nd0	so the images get zero mean and std 1?
 blackburn	I mean vectors of your features should have L2 norm = 1 for linear kernel
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn	could be better
 n4nd0	the features are not normalized :(
 blackburn	preprocessor = NormOne()
 blackburn	preprocessor.apply_to_feature_matrix(train_features)
 blackburn	preprocessor.apply_to_feature_matrix(test_features)
 blackburn	something like that
 n4nd0	ok, I will take it a look
 n4nd0	even if the features are the pixel of the images and the images are already normalized, do you think it will make a difference?
 n4nd0	they are normalized as I told you, zero mean and standard deviation equal to one
 blackburn	I don't know
 blackburn	better try
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: how is it a good way to choose the parameters for the kernels, such as the width for the Gaussian?
 n4nd0	cross-validation?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	blackburn: hey man btw do you know viktor pelevin? he's one of my favorite contemporary writers... and i've just seen that they've made a movie out of one of his books http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459748/
 blackburn	wiking: yes, I've seen this movie :)
 wiking	is it good?
 blackburn	and have read a book as well
 blackburn	not bad :)
 wiking	unfortunately haven't read that book yet from him.. but all the latest ones...
 wiking	starting from the yellow arrow
 wiking	empire v
 blackburn	generation P is the only book I've read :)
 blackburn	from pelevin I mean
 blackburn	not generally :D
 wiking	and sacred book of the werewolf... and i don't know what was the english title for one playing in the big russian revolution time
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	anyhow he's really cool
 wiking	i'm just getting this movie
 wiking	i'm just a bit scared of the subtitles
 blackburn	is it translated?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	hey you should understand russian a little :)
 wiking	heheh i do a little
 blackburn	wiking: there are a lot of really good artists
 wiking	it's funny when i was living in australia there were a lot of russians around me... i could understand 60-70% of what they were saying... but when i've tried serbian with them they couldn't understand a word...
 blackburn	epifantsev as tatarsky, efremov as azadovsky..
 blackburn	have you been living in australia??
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	for almost 2 years
 blackburn	damn is there any island where you weren't?
 wiking	never been to latin america nor africa and neither in asia
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	just been at bangkok airport 3 times :P
 wiking	i wanted to do the transiberian
 wiking	but that has been postponed... but hoping to do it once soon
 wiking	where are u living in russia atm?
 blackburn	you are welcome at samara/togliatti
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	aaah
 wiking	it's by the volga river right?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	cool
 wiking	how far is the star city from you? :)
 blackburn	the place 'lada' cars are being made
 blackburn	star?
 wiking	i mean cosmos city
 wiking	or what
 wiking	in kazakstan
 blackburn	ah baikonur?
 wiking	aaah yeah
 blackburn	pretty far
 blackburn	let me check
 wiking	fucking hell i'm tired not remembering the name
 wiking	oooh fuck
 wiking	it's that faaar
 wiking	i mean baikonur
 blackburn	~1200
 wiking	heheheh so the name for the car lada samara is coming from the name of the city ?:)))
 wiking	hahah didn't know that one :>
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	VAZ is in togliatti
 wiking	that's a funny car :>
 blackburn	but cars was named after city, right
 blackburn	sometimes it is called zubilo
 blackburn	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Lada_Samara.JPG/220px-Lada_Samara.JPG
 blackburn	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/ColdChisels.jpg/220px-ColdChisels.jpg
 blackburn	something similar right?
 wiking	yep yep those lada samaras
 wiking	i remember seeing them a lot
 blackburn	where?
 wiking	well all around eastern europe
 wiking	but since the communism stopped being...
 blackburn	btw now they do cars like that
 blackburn	http://wroom.ru/i/cars2/lada_priora_1.jpg
 wiking	woah
 wiking	high tech shit
 blackburn	not as ugly
 wiking	loved russian cars
 blackburn	as it was
 wiking	they were reliable
 wiking	and simple so easy to fix
 blackburn	not really but it is easy to fix it
 wiking	yeah i mean that's why
 blackburn	with kuvalda
 wiking	even if there was something even somebody with a little knowledge could fix it
 wiking	uaz
 wiking	or what was that truck
 blackburn	uaz being made a little norther
 blackburn	in ulyanovsk
 wiking	ahhaha they were like survivor machines
 wiking	:)
 wiking	the uaz bus
 wiking	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/UAZ-Bus.jpg
 blackburn	bus? I'm not sure
 wiking	this oen!!!
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	buhanka
 wiking	do u know this one? :)
 blackburn	this shit is fucking crazy
 wiking	that thing was going in any shit :)))
 blackburn	it is able to climb 75 degree mountain
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	yep
 wiking	amazing shit
 blackburn	I heard one story
 blackburn	a couple of guys went to hunt a little
 blackburn	here
 blackburn	they had land cruiser, etc
 blackburn	so they sticked in snow
 blackburn	and there came man on this uaz
 blackburn	pulled their cars easily and told them to use better cars next time :D
 wiking	nothing can mess with an UAZ!!!
 wiking	yeah i totally believe
 blackburn	hah yeah crazy car
 wiking	that car is some amazing piece of mechanism
 blackburn	there are a lot of them still here
 wiking	but yeah i really like russian made stuff... i mean they are just bruteforce
 wiking	they were never nice and shinny stuff
 wiking	but for the purpose it was great :)
 blackburn	rather soviet
 wiking	hahahaha
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i just remember the soviet era stuff
 wiking	dunno how is it now with russia :>
 wiking	how's IT doing it there?
 wiking	i mean it should be great in one way
 blackburn	IT?
 blackburn	inf. tech. stuff?
 wiking	as there's amazing coders coming from russia
 wiking	yeah inf.tech
 blackburn	well it is ok
 blackburn	for example we have a lot of outsource in samara
 blackburn	netcracker, epam ,mercury
 blackburn	I work at netcracker btw
 wiking	heheheh i always wondered why people talk about outsourcing to india, when russian coders are way better imho
 blackburn	yeah I think so :)
 wiking	man when i was working with indians in nokia....
 wiking	i really cannot explain
 blackburn	I can imagine haha
 wiking	if i could have i would release all their codes
 blackburn	in one book?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	it's like 2 functions they've used for EVERYTHING
 blackburn	oracle_func_1
 blackburn	oracle_func_2
 wiking	exactly
 wiking	i remember cleaning up their shit
 blackburn	this function oracles everything
 blackburn	hah
 wiking	and the best is
 wiking	using 2 files
 wiking	.h and .cpp
 wiking	not more
 wiking	2
 blackburn	damn how old are you?
 wiking	and that was for a browser interface
 blackburn	you were at every country I know
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	worked in every company?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	ahahah too old man too old
 wiking	30
 blackburn	ohh it is being clearer now
 wiking	hehehe yeah makes sense right? :P
 blackburn	hah yeah
 wiking	but yeah it is fucking crazy cleaning up a 10k+ lines file
 blackburn	I have 2/3 of your hah
 wiking	hahahahahahahha
 wiking	little green grasshopper then
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: wow the training with the Gaussian kernel is never ending :-O
 blackburn	n4nd0: should be a little slower
 blackburn	hmm..
 blackburn	wiking: artist playing tatarsky in generation P had some crazy roles before
 blackburn	for example
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=jhzpe7QxlGw
 wiking	hahahaha
 blackburn	lets test your russian
 blackburn	did you get title? :)
 wiking	what is ??????
 wiking	?
 blackburn	head
 wiking	ahhaha
 blackburn	TIDE or cutting off the head, something like that I guess
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i didn't get ????
 blackburn	just tide
 wiking	cutting was ok
 wiking	i got that one
 wiking	and of course ili
 wiking	:P
 wiking	aaah golovi
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	it's glava on serbian
 wiking	i should have got it
 blackburn	3:10 hah
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	hmm I just wonder what do you think about kosovo
 wiking	honestly
 blackburn	3:46 is ok a well
 wiking	no opinion
 wiking	i mean it's a big mess
 wiking	it's just bad that people cannot agree on it in a normal manner
 wiking	but that's quite usual in balkans :P
 blackburn	as for me it was a great shame for my country to not help serbians there
 wiking	i mean that they cannot communicate in a normal manner
 blackburn	but may be I'm wrong
 wiking	well
 wiking	it's really not nice for the minorities there (kosovoar people)
 wiking	because of the past stories... oppression by the serbs etc
 wiking	so i completely understand that part
 wiking	it's just funny when people from around the world who have no idea about anything
 wiking	try to fix it
 wiking	:)
 wiking	but when you look at their 'own mess' it's even worse in a way
 blackburn	so a lot of my friends (me as well) think 'kosovo je serbia' :)
 wiking	like the guy who sketched up the 'solution' for kosovo is from finland
 blackburn	funny thing I don't think chechnya should be included
 blackburn	into russia
 wiking	and for instance the situation with russians in finland (on the border)
 wiking	it's like wtf
 wiking	i mean finnish people just amazingly hating russians... :(
 wiking	hehehe yeah you have some troubles of your own as well
 blackburn	for what?
 wiking	well i don't know
 wiking	it's just something from the past
 blackburn	do you know how they 'solved' chechnya problem?
 blackburn	njet molotoff hah
 wiking	hahahahahha
 wiking	i mean their hate is irrational (finnish)
 wiking	they hate russians because they tried to invade finland couple of times
 blackburn	hah yeah
 wiking	but they have almost no real problems with the swedes
 wiking	who kind of like ruled them for 100+ years
 wiking	so it's amazing how unbalanced that shit is
 blackburn	I know no one hating finnish :)
 wiking	but it's all the same with those countries there in the baltics
 blackburn	estonia/latvia/lithuania same
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	they hate their soviet legacy
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but it's part of their culture
 wiking	and identity
 wiking	so funny to hate something that is part of u
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	btw currently we don't like soviet state of mind as well
 wiking	ahhahahah
 wiking	well
 wiking	i don't know which was better
 wiking	i mean don't get me wrong
 wiking	i don't know that much of current state of russia
 wiking	but the thing with putin and yelcin
 blackburn	so the situation with putin clearly describes what I mean
 blackburn	people here want vozhd
 blackburn	who will rule them
 wiking	yeah i kind of like sensed that one... that in russia some people just want a big leader
 blackburn	30% do
 wiking	something like stalin
 blackburn	+ some falsification
 wiking	or breznyev :P
 blackburn	and here we go, putin again
 wiking	ehehheheh
 wiking	but that's amazing
 wiking	i mean the whole thing around putin
 wiking	the oligarch
 wiking	it's like a big fucking maffia
 blackburn	exactly it is
 wiking	especially with gazprom
 blackburn	some day he will be judged
 blackburn	particularly yukos as well
 wiking	i mean on the other hand if u look what was happening with yelcin...
 blackburn	khodorkovsky
 blackburn	yeltsin was worse for sure
 wiking	i mean that was amazing how the things gone really bad with yeltsin
 wiking	everything started to get wasted...
 blackburn	but there was a big bonus for russia
 blackburn	cost of oil
 wiking	heheh yeah
 blackburn	it impacted everything
 blackburn	if there was 30$ for barrel - there would be no way for such 'great putin'
 blackburn	would be only wastelands here :)
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	wiking: do you know how they trying to calm down people here?
 blackburn	there were protests after elections
 blackburn	a lot of
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	read about those
 blackburn	they just grow hate to US
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	they say US wants to do revolution here
 wiking	no way!
 blackburn	hahah
 wiking	ahahahah
 blackburn	yes, they say we don't want another lebanon here
 blackburn	or siria
 blackburn	or egypt
 blackburn	it works for not-too-smart-people
 blackburn	but more educated city people usually just laughs at it
 wiking	sorry but i gotta run again... would love to continue this conversation some time soon
 wiking	:(
 blackburn	aha okay :)
 wiking	but yeah fuck putin :P
 blackburn	was great to talk to you
 blackburn	hahah
 wiking	yeah you too!
 wiking	laterz!
 blackburn	see you
 wiking	cya
 n4nd0	blackburn: should it be better if I increase the cache-size parameter?
 n4nd0	right now is to 40, and it has been training the svm for a long long while
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes, should be
 blackburn	still??
 blackburn	that's crazy :)
 n4nd0	yeah I know :-P
 n4nd0	but it is also because the size of the images changed when I tried with some fancy haar features
 n4nd0	I am going to come back to the 19x19 and increase the size cache
 n4nd0	which one is a good value for it?
 blackburn	it is size of cache in mb
 blackburn	you may use any that fits into your memory
 n4nd0	and for the width in the Gaussian?
 n4nd0	an approximate value that should go good?
 n4nd0	is there any heuristic or thumb rule to use?
 blackburn	well not really
 blackburn	it should be very small and very large
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	shouldn't*
 blackburn	I don't know any good
 n4nd0	I will try with 20 then
 n4nd0	blackburn: nothing good with the Gaussian kernel :(
 blackburn	bad
 n4nd0	by the way
 n4nd0	I don't think I got clearly the idea behind the two parameters for the kernel constructors
 n4nd0	I mean the ones that are called
 n4nd0	CDotFeatures * l, CDotFeatures * r
 n4nd0	so far I am using the same for both
 n4nd0	feats_train, feats_train
 n4nd0	but feels weird to do it that way
 n4nd0	blackburn: should they be different things?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no
 blackburn	ok when you train classifier
 blackburn	you need k_ij between train features and train features
 blackburn	but when you classify
 blackburn	you need kernel values between train features and test features
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	that thing is going on when you call apply
 blackburn	it inits kernel with
 blackburn	feats_train, feats_test
 blackburn	and when do things according alphas/support vectors
 n4nd0	actually I am not changing anything new when I call apply
 blackburn	apply does
 n4nd0	I do sth like
 n4nd0	kernel        = GaussianKernel(feats_train, feats_train, width, size_cache)
 n4nd0	svm = LibSVM(C, kernel, labels_train)
 n4nd0	svm.train()
 n4nd0	output  = svm.apply(feats_test)
 blackburn	svm.apply() changes kernel
 blackburn	it inits kernel with feats train and feats test
 blackburn	svm.apply(feats_train) I mean
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so there is nothing I should change?
 n4nd0	is it done automatically?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	it is the same if you
 blackburn	did
 blackburn	kernel.init(feats_train,feats_test)
 blackburn	output = svm.apply()
 blackburn	without anytihng in apply()
 n4nd0	cool I get it
 blackburn	not very clear design here
 n4nd0	I have to go now for a while
 n4nd0	be back later
 n4nd0	bye
 blackburn	but no idea how to do it flexible and in better way
 blackburn	bye
