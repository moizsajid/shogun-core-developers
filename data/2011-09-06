@sonney2k	it scored badly already
 blackburn	sonney2k: well so what is the matter?
@sonney2k	it is demotivating
@sonney2k	I prefer fixing bugs by several orders of magnitude
@sonney2k	or doing debian pkg's
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the blog entry you are doing?
@sonney2k	shogun gsoc
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	LLE (Locally Linear Embedding)
@sonney2k	Hessian LLE
@sonney2k	Classic MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)
@sonney2k	Landmark MDS
@sonney2k	ISOMAP
@sonney2k	SNE (Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
@sonney2k	is this still accurate?
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	Locally Linear Embedding
 blackburn	Kernel Locally Linear Embedding
 blackburn	Local Tangent Space Alignment
 blackburn	Multidimensional scaling (with capability of landmark approximation)
 blackburn	Isomap
 blackburn	Hessian Locally Linear Embedding
 blackburn	Laplacian Eigenmaps
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^ that is accurate
@sonney2k	copied
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw, what is up with our bug list
@sonney2k	are you getting close to 0 bugs again?
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you talking about our test failures?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	well no
@sonney2k	or yes?
@sonney2k	I mean the old regression tests
 blackburn	no, some kernels are looking good but results are wrong
@sonney2k	blackburn, not sure if you have time to work on this - how is it going with uni/your job? Workload 200%?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really, I have no workload on job yet - some trainings now
 blackburn	it looks I will have time on some evenings
@sonney2k	that would be nice
 blackburn	good thing - I'm not any tired after study/work day
 blackburn	so I hope it will go this way
@sonney2k	I am but I hope I will manage to finish sth today

 blackburn	sonney2k: because of?
@sonney2k	work, kids, shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: the only embarrasing thing I have now - I have to do some coursework on numerical mathematical physics
 blackburn	heat equation in 3d, essentially
