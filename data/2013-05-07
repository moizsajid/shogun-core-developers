@wiking	sonney2k: yo
@sonney2k	wiking, what?
@wiking	sonney2k: ok so i didn't get it the last day
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.54.230] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
@wiking	sonney2k: about unit testing random
@wiking	sonney2k: can i have a test in unit tests where i read a data from data submodule?
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.54.230] has joined #shogun
@wiking	sonney2k: or that should rather be the part of integration test?
@sonney2k	wiking, don't you think generating say 10 numbers and keeping them in ascii as unit test is sufficient?
@sonney2k	or even generate 2x 10000 numbers with same seed
@sonney2k	compare that they are the same
@sonney2k	and check if the 10000th number is the same
@wiking	sonney2k: ah nono
@wiking	sonney2k:  i mean what i do now is this
@wiking	http://pastebin.com/xL6S0Lpc
@wiking	this will generate the same numbers
@wiking	the only 'problem' is that this does not test the arch/os independency
@wiking	as for sure these 2 vectors are going to be the same
@wiking	but they are not testing whether they are the same when it's on a different machine ;P
@wiking	i mean different os/arch
@wiking	should be of course ... :P
@wiking	as the implementation is the same :)
@wiking	but then again we should have a test for this
@wiking	but we can do that then in the integration test
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.54.230] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but if you just store the 10000th number - in some const then you have your test
@wiking	sonney2k: well that's another option as well

 thoralf	Whatever I do, shogun never stops throwing "*** glibc detected ***", "double free or corruption (!prev)".
 thoralf	gdb tells me the pointer - is there a way to find out, where this pointer has been allocated?
 thoralf	Using valgrind, gdb, etc.?
@wiking	thoralf: valgrind it
 thoralf	wiking: It's a heisenbug. ;)
 thoralf	wiking: Valgrind does not tell me - instead it says "Address 0xb092b68 is 0 bytes after a block of size 8,184 alloc'd" (in foreign code)
@wiking	well
@wiking	with gdb and valgrind you pretty much can find any such bug
@wiking	;)
 thoralf	wiking: This claim needs proof... ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, compile w/o optimizations enabled then you will see :D
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-318776.home.otenet.gr] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 thoralf	sonney2k: I already compiled with --disable-optimization --enable-debug -O0 -g, etc. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, then you are running multithreaded Iguess
@wiking	thoralf: this claim has been proven by u running an OS
@wiking	;)
@wiking	that has mouse, keyboard, screen, gpu etc
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yes, looks like.
 thoralf	How to turn threading off?
 thoralf	Will mkl->parallel->set_num_threads(1) be enough?
 thoralf	Okay, seems so.  But at lease it did not change errors.
@sonney2k	thoralf, how/when are you getting these double frees?
@sonney2k	with streaming features?
 thoralf	Yes.
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	yes that's all multi threaded
@sonney2k	there is one thread reading in data
@sonney2k	trying to keep some buffer full
@sonney2k	and another doing the learning
 thoralf	sonney2k: It seems that "anyone" frees the .features in sparsevectors.
 thoralf	sonney2k: Copying all vectors seems to fix the double-frees, but introduces bigger leaks...
@sonney2k	thoralf, when we did the conversion from e.g. double* vec, int vec_len -> SGVector
@sonney2k	we didn't manage to finish this for everything yet
@sonney2k	IIRC SparseFeatures still uses no SGSparseMatrix
@sonney2k	which it should
 thoralf	sonney2k: I've been filling SGSparseMatrix by myself - with vectors from get_vector() ;)
@sonney2k	no wonder then
 thoralf	sonney2k: So what's the intended use of the sparse vectors from get_vectors()?
 thoralf	Am I supposed to copy them?
 thoralf	copy as-in deep copy
@sonney2k	thoralf, *intended* is that you create / get a sparse vector and use it / pass it around
@sonney2k	freeing is done automagically
 thoralf	sonney2k: Okay, that's what I did.
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.3] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 thoralf	Except that freeing is done automagically by someone else. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah streaming features I guess
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yes, maybe it's related to this example buffer?
 thoralf	sonney2k: I initialized the example buffer to 1024 examples - are they freed or reused?
@sonney2k	thoralf, well each example is a separately allocated
@sonney2k	so it is just a list with 1k examples
@sonney2k	and for sure they will be freed once you are done with them
@sonney2k	thoralf, let me explain in detail how it is supposed to work once transitioned to the SG* structures:
@sonney2k	the SGVector (or SGSparseVector etc) structures keep an internal reference count
@sonney2k	so whenever you do SGVector x = y;
@sonney2k	and y is some SGVector too
@sonney2k	then we only copy references and size of the vector
@sonney2k	to decrease refcount one needs to do
@sonney2k	x=SGVector()
@sonney2k	which will then assign an empty vector to x
@sonney2k	decreasing the refcount for y again
@sonney2k	and if y is no longer used
@sonney2k	it will be destroyed too
@sonney2k	now I guess you are seeing things like someone manually SG_FREE'ing the vector
@sonney2k	and then it will later be destroyed -> boom
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yeah, thats what I'm thinking.
@sonney2k	the correct fix is difficult :/
@sonney2k	maybe you can put NULL to the sgvector after the SG_FREE
@sonney2k	as workaround
@sonney2k	but you might suffer from an even more subtle situation:
@sonney2k	consider you want to have an array of SGVectors
@sonney2k	SGVector x[17];
@sonney2k	that is all good
@sonney2k	but SGVector* x = malloc (...);
@sonney2k	you get a kaboom
@sonney2k	b'cause it needs the inplace new[]()  - otherwise the constructor of sgvector is not called
@sonney2k	and some stuff like refcount is not initialized
@sonney2k	I tried to make this automatic by using SG_MALLOC - and for that malloc for SGVector is overloaded to call new[]
@sonney2k	it is not ideal but I don't see a better way
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it doesn't look normal to have SGVector*
 thoralf	sonney2k: shogun/io/streaming/ParseBuffer.h, finalize_example(), SG_FREE is called on ex_ring[i].fv.vector; the same fv.vector, has been passed to InputParser.h, which passes CStreamingSparseFeatures<T>::get_next_example() and current_vector.
 thoralf	sonney2k: The same reference then gets into SGSparseVector... q.e.d. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah
@sonney2k	thoralf, if we would rewrite this to use
 thoralf	sonney2k: But I don't know how to fix ;)
@sonney2k	some SGSpareseVector buf[1024]
@sonney2k	then no more free is needed
@sonney2k	but just a buf[10]=SGSparseVector()
@sonney2k	to decrease the refcount of vector 10
 thoralf	sonney2k: current_vector is SGSparseVectorEntry<T>*
@sonney2k	that has to be refactored
@sonney2k	it needs to become
@sonney2k	SGSparseVector
 thoralf	sonney2k: in fact, current_vector is redundant, since it's the same as current_sgvector.features (only after calling get_vector())
@sonney2k	sounds like
-!- sijin [~smuxi@144.214.222.109] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	sonney2k: But in any case we need to copy the contents of current_vector, since ParseBuffer seems to take care of it (including deallocation).
@sonney2k	thoralf, doesn't hurt - comparing this copy to a read from disk is like 1000 times faster
 thoralf	sonney2k: where does the disk read come from?
@sonney2k	thoralf, streaming features!

 pickle27	iglesiasg: hey I re-ran after building with no optimization and got this http://pastebin.com/LHqAyAUv
@iglesiasg	pickle27: hey
@iglesiasg	I checked the log you pasted last night
@iglesiasg	let me see this one
@iglesiasg	pickle27: but it is still the same error I am afraid
@iglesiasg	vex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0xC5 0xF9 0x57 0xC0 0xE8 0x73 0x4 0xFF
@iglesiasg	pickle27: isn't it?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: yeah I saw that there in the middle but there was more upfront I thought might help
@iglesiasg	pickle27: not really honestly
 pickle27	iglesiasg: can we re-try the build server and see if it crashes when running the example again
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I can try to take a look at it in my computer
 pickle27	iglesiasg: okay. because I don't know what else I can do to debug if I can't replicate the actual crash on my pc
@iglesiasg	pickle27: both the MLDA code and the example has been merged to upstream develop right?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: yes it was merged yesterday
@iglesiasg	pickle27: so I will take a look ASAP and give you and answer in the mailing list
 pickle27	okay sounds good, thanks!
@iglesiasg	probably by tomorrow midday
@iglesiasg	so that is like 15h from now for me
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I think we are in different time zones :)
 pickle27	iglesiasg: yeah I've come to notice haha, Europe?
@iglesiasg	pickle27: yep
 pickle27	iglesiasg: cool, I'm in Canada
@iglesiasg	pickle27: nice! I will try to take more care of my English then :P
@iglesiasg	well are you in English or French speaking area?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: I'm in an English area, I do speak a bit of french though, whereabouts are you in Europe?
@iglesiasg	pickle27: right now in Spain, I live in Sweden though
 pickle27	iglesiasg: neat!
 thoralf	pickle27: Tried to add --enable-debug --disable-optimization to ./configure?  This should remove the illegal instructions in valgrind.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I think he has already tried compiling with the disabel-optimization option
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Maybe, but as he didn't mention it in his post, I thought it could save him some trial and error. :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k suggested doing that yesterday
 thoralf	iglesiasg: It still looks too familiar to me... ;)
 thoralf	pickle27: We're wondering if you tried (in shogun/src): make clean; ./configure --enable-debug --disable-optimization
@iglesiasg	:)
 votjakovr	Hi guys :) Has anyone run integration tests on local machine? Is regression_gaussian_process_modular.py failed?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, seems it works: http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	why?
@sonney2k	wiking, ubu1 - libshogun buildbot is down
 thoralf	sonney2k: Cool visualization.
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Oh, but travis-ci shows an errors.
@sonney2k	thoralf, what?
 thoralf	sonney2k: The buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	thoralf, ahh ok
@sonney2k	wasn't so impressive to me..
@sonney2k	votjakovr, checking
@sonney2k	votjakovr, hmmhh the returned label vector is *slightly* different
@sonney2k	any idea why that could be?
@sonney2k	any randomness in there?
@sonney2k	or different numerical libraries?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, don't you have ubuntu?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: I currently use more arch than ubuntu
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	I wish we could reproduce the travis failure
@sonney2k	travis runs on ubuntu
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Nope, when I changed implementation of ExactInferenceMethod, I regenerated test data. And everything is OK on my machine.
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn uses ubuntu I think
 votjakovr	sonney2k: And I use Ubuntu 13.04
@sonney2k	votjakovr, which version of numpy?
@sonney2k	1.6.1 or .2?
 pickle27	thoralf: I will try now
 votjakovr	sonney2k: 1.7.1
@sonney2k	votjakovr, hmm - labels is generated randomly though
@sonney2k	votjakovr, I just checked the diff
@sonney2k	for some reason the 100 dim label vector differs in 3 entries
@sonney2k	1.144566753132682 vs 1.144566753132681
@sonney2k	1.15097403962122 vs 1.150974039621219
@sonney2k	1.447796756701278 vs 1.447796756701277

@sonney2k	wiking, is there any way to specify the numpy version in travis?
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Yep, I have done the same. But I have no idea why they are different...
 votjakovr	sonney2k: Maybe some problem with floating point precision
@sonney2k	votjakovr, me neither and I don't understand how the rest of the output can match perfectly
@sonney2k	votjakovr, does the algorithm use threads or anything
@lisitsyn	what's up?
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.3.6] has joined #shogun

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no I haven't
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: 8
 naywhayare	nice!  I was hoping for that many but just like I was told to expect we got only two :)
@sonney2k	cool
 gsomix	lisitsyn, sonney2k hey, guys, wuts goin' on?
@sonney2k	so we only have to unaccept 2 :D
@lisitsyn	hah yes currently
@sonney2k	we had 9 last year but used only 8 right?
@lisitsyn	yes
@sonney2k	naywhayare, be grateful it's a lot of work
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: oh we already got an answer?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah carols is fast this time
@iglesiasg	I thought it was going to be tom!
@lisitsyn	I guess it may be changed
@sonney2k	she wants to be on vacations soon so :)
@iglesiasg	hehe
@lisitsyn	oh! I should ask her about delivering t-shirt to you sonney2k
@lisitsyn	are you ok with it?
@iglesiasg	8 is a nice number anyway
@iglesiasg	let's do some vodking
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: you know the way
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: is it a good idea to tweet about this?
@sonney2k	why not
 naywhayare	sonney2k: yeah, you are probably right...
 naywhayare	(well... more than probably. you've done this before :))
@lisitsyn	twice
@lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	naywhayare, it really depends on your students/mentors though. with 8 it already is quite a bit of coordination. and if one student/mentor sucks you can easily cope with that
@sonney2k	when you have 'just' 2 slots
 naywhayare	yeah; we got a number of good applications though, so it will be tough to choose which two to accept
 naywhayare	even so, with how busy I tend to be, it's probably a good thing in terms of "work/life balance" (not that I get to know what that is as a grad student...)
@sonney2k	naywhayare, what we did was ask our top candidates all for patches
@sonney2k	even already for their project
@sonney2k	then you select the most engaged
@sonney2k	and that obviously wasn't the wrong decision
 naywhayare	that is probably a good idea; a few of our candidates have already taken the initiative and started doing that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn and heiko are still around :D
@sonney2k	3 years later now
@lisitsyn	yeah I am a gsoc child
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	no, I am here for two years I think
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, true
@sonney2k	2011

@wiking	and i'm totally objective as i dont even know
 thoralf	Good choice. ;)
@wiking	the applications
@wiking	sonney2k: hehehe well u can assign any of the applications to be 3 and 7
@wiking	:P
@wiking	haven't defined the order of the applications

 pickle27	the people involved in this left but I just re-ran the valgrind after compiling shogun with debugging symbols and got the same result, http://pastebin.com/00rU2vcU
 pickle27	iglesias is going to try on his machine and see if he can reproduce the error because I can not - the classifier_lda example still runs fine on my system
@sonney2k	pickle27, what is the issue?
 gsomix	wiking, hey, you're awesome.
