 abinash_panda	Hey thor|home !
 thor|home	Hey abinash_panda
 thor|home	abinash_panda: I read your mail.  As long as the results are comparable with other implementations, I don't see big problems. :)
 abinash_panda	thor|home: Ok :)
 abinash_panda	thor|home: scikit-learn also trains multiple classifiers independently for multilabel classification. That's why I think the results are comparable.
 thor|home	abinash_panda: Okay, sounds plausible.
