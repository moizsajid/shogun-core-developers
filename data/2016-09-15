 Vigsterk	Hi! Anyone hear that can edit the contact page on your website or know someone who can?
 lisitsyn	Vigsterk: why?
 Vigsterk	I think Viktor Gal's email is incorrect.  That's my email and I get questions from people on this IRC every so often
 Vigsterk	I just spoke to someone who mistakenly sent an email to me.  Just wanted to inform someone.
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	Vigsterk: are you talking about http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/contacts?
 Vigsterk	Yes, that's the page that has my email on it.
 Vigsterk	Just wanted to let you know.  Have a good day!

 mem_issues	does this error a rookie mistake?
 mem_issues	Out of memory error, tried to allocate -16524698368 bytes using malloc.  Line 00161 http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/2.0.1/memory_8cpp_source.html
 mem_issues	I'm testing with side sparse data and hit this malloc at around 2million samples... my assumption is I have a 32bit pacakges somewhere? (using eigen backend)
 mem_issues	thanks in advance if this rings a bell for anyone... thank you!
 lisitsyn	mem_issues: thanks for letting us know
 mem_issues	if you guys want me to test a fix I can help out, have 1TB working mem on this server
 mem_issues	*wide sparse, not side
