 parijat	iglesiasg, hello
 parijat	iglesiasg, I sent a fresh PR but there are additional test failures now! :(
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 parijat	iglesiasg, specially I cant figure out the problem with evaluation_clustering_kmeans_simple, it doesnt use any external data but shows an exception
@iglesiasg	parijat, let me see
 parijat	iglesiasg, sure!
@iglesiasg	parijat, the evaluation_clustering_kmeans_simple worked when I did it locally though
@iglesiasg	parijat, and the others have probably come because of the "fix" that I sent for evaluation_clustering_simple
@iglesiasg	which seems to have broken more tests actually
 parijat	iglesiasg, same with me.
@iglesiasg	parijat, I would not worry too much for the moment for the travis error of evaluation_clustering_simple
@iglesiasg	parijat, because it does not happen either in the buildbot
@iglesiasg	parijat, aaah wait
@iglesiasg	parijat, it did not happen in the previous travis build
@iglesiasg	parijat, so the fail in evaluation_clustering_simple might be due to your changes
 parijat	iglesiasg. I guess it happened.
 parijat	iglesiasg, it shows an exception
 parijat	iglesiasg, have a look at this log please https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/17603333
@iglesiasg	parijat, what line?
 parijat	iglesiasg, there is additionally a new failure in the fresh PR in clustering_kmeans_modular
@iglesiasg	parijat, the one for the error in evaluation_clustering_simple?
 parijat	iglesiasg, let me see
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am working on the error affecting the other integration tests, so please have a look at why the evaluation_clustering_simple fails :)
 parijat	iglesiasg, 4056
 parijat	iglesiasg, no but this other test clustering_kmeans_modular might not be caused by your changes line 4254
@iglesiasg	parijat, what?
 parijat	iglesiasg, test clustering_kmeans_modular failure is caused because output doesnt match with expected data
 parijat	iglesiasg, thats probably because I changed implementation slightly!
@iglesiasg	parijat, ok
@iglesiasg	parijat, we need to make sure that it is because of that, and not because a bug was introduced
@iglesiasg	parijat, what do you think you changed in the implementation that might make the output change slightly?
 parijat	iglesiasg, earlier choosing points during updating cluster centers was done randomly, I changed it to choose points in a deterministic fashion
@iglesiasg	parijat, why so?
 parijat	iglesiasg, that has improved results in my own test actually
@iglesiasg	parijat, in the rectangle test?
 parijat	iglesiasg, yup
@iglesiasg	parijat, but we cannot tell that it is in general better to choose those points deterministically because of that
 parijat	iglesiasg, in the random case many times the final centers were not means of clusters
 parijat	iglesiasg, but in this case its always that!
@iglesiasg	parijat, I don't know right now how Lloyd's algorithm work, I would need to check
@iglesiasg	parijat,  how is this step normally done in other implementations or references for the algorithm?
 parijat	iglesiasg, let me check!
 parijat	iglesiasg, the algorithm I studied in class was deterministic like I implemented. But randomization might be some kind of heuristic added to it which might work better on larger number of points
@iglesiasg	parijat, yes, that makes sense
 parijat	iglesiasg, let me check whats generally done
@iglesiasg	parijat, I just committed something that should fix the errors in the integration tests (except from the one you are working on)
@iglesiasg	parijat, feel free to rebase and update the PR
 parijat	iglesiasg, sure!
 parijat	iglesiasg, thanks :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, no problem!
@iglesiasg	arggh I always forget how to restart the build in the buildbot
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, lisitsyn1 do you happen to remember ^
@iglesiasg	I think I got it in the logs!
@iglesiasg	shogun-buildbot, force build 'deb3 - modular_interfaces'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@iglesiasg	shogun-buildbot, aright
 shogun-buildbot	build #44 of deb4 - python3 is complete: Failure [failed test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb4%20-%20python3/builds/44  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	parijat, do you close and open a new PR when you update it for any special reason??
 parijat	iglesiasg, not always this time I got non-fastforward error so thats why I did it
@iglesiasg	parijat, sure, normal. It is fine to force the push in this case though. git push --force ...
 parijat	iglesiasg, alright
 parijat	iglesiasg, I reverted the randomization step! If need be we can change it later with proper backgroud study.
@iglesiasg	parijat, good idea
@iglesiasg	now another two tests failing in travis....
@iglesiasg	I believe this is a random thing though, unrelated
