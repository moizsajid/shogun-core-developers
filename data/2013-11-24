 thoralf	Heyhey.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, hello hello
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, around?
@iglesiasg	or someone with some Django experience around?
@iglesiasg	ok, no problem. I found what I needed :)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Trying ony stackoverflow code snippet after another? ;)
 thoralf	http://xkcd.com/1185/
@iglesiasg	hehe not really, I found in the doc actually!
 thoralf	(don't forget to check the mouse-over of the xkcd strip)

@sonney2k	thoralf, around?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yes.
@sonney2k	thoralf, I am just wondering why you didn't make SGRefObject not a base class of CSGObject?
@sonney2k	but really only the minimal thing in SGRefObject
 thoralf	sonney2k: I first wanted some feedback before spending more time on this.
 thoralf	CSGObject does a lot of things.  Which should be put into SGRefObject and which should stay?  How does this relate to SGReferencedData/ReferencedObject, etc.?
@sonney2k	thoralf, just the refcounting no more should go into SGRefObject - as I said my biggest Q would be if we can use SGReferencedData (and just have one base class for referenced stuff)
@sonney2k	but maybe not at this stage
@sonney2k	thoralf, then maybe the CDynamicObjectArray should get another parent CDynamicRefObjectArray
@sonney2k	which contains all the stuff but the serialization
 thoralf	I knew I'm triggering lots of ideas. ;)
 thoralf	But for now, making CSGObject subclass of SGRefObject would do?
@sonney2k	thoralf, look the easy (and reasonable change) is SGReferencedObject <- CSGObject
@sonney2k	so that should be done in one patch
 thoralf	Yes, I just didn't know if you will approve the way I chose and how much of the functionality should be outsourced.
 thoralf	It just happend a few times that I did something you rejected.
@sonney2k	thoralf, the absolute minimum
 thoralf	I'm on the way.
@sonney2k	thoralf, you already did too much in one PR...
 thoralf	For example?
@sonney2k	thoralf, I am not sure how if you should use DynArray later - I mean it does not ref/unref there so it might be leaky
 thoralf	Yes, but it was the easiest way of get it working, since DynamicObjectArray only accepts CSGObjects.
@sonney2k	thoralf, it might make sense to have DynamicRefObjectArray for automagic ref/unref'ing
 thoralf	I totally know that.  But I cannot spend more time on this issue -- the waste of memory has been reduced, so that my stuff runs.
 thoralf	What I now do is just a favour for you guys. ;)
 thoralf	sonney2k, I'm now having a problem with examples/undocumented/libshogun/library_gc_array.cpp: I'm getting a segfault in "return 0".
 thoralf	The problem seems to be that the destructor is called *after* shogun_exit().
 thoralf	Putting a scope around, ending before shogun_exit() solves the problem.
 thoralf	Obviously we shouldn't call shogun_exit() if we're having automatic (shogun) variables in the same scope.
* sonney2k is just doing this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkZp851aOnE#t=201
 thoralf	This video is currently unavailable.
 thoralf	But the title tells a lot.
@sonney2k	thoralf, the simple refactoring shouldn't break anything
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yes, but the problem existed before.
 thoralf	calling shogun_exit() in a scope, where variables exist, is problematic: In my case only changing SG_GCDEBUG to SG_SGCDEBUG triggered the problem.
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes of course makes sense
@sonney2k	everything has to be freed before that

 thoralf	sonney2k: The pull request has been updated.  I'm happy to announce: All refcount code from CSGObjects has been put into its new superclass SGRefObject.
 thoralf	:D
@sonney2k	thoralf, errm dont' see the PR!
 thoralf	It's still this one: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1770
 thoralf	push --force
 thoralf	I did not create a new class DynamicRefObjectArray, btw.
@sonney2k	thoralf, ohh please3 a PR with just the SGRefObject no more
 thoralf	What about the StructuredData stuff?
@sonney2k	thoralf, not yet
 thoralf	I don't understand.

 sonne|osx	thoralf: what I meant is that we should for now just do the SGRefObject refactoring in one PR not the other stuff you are doing
 sonne|osx	thoralf: and really minimal please - no other functions like get_name etc - these should really all stay in SGObject
 sonne|osx	(to the extent possible...)
 thoralf	sonne|osx: No problem, I'll send another PR.  But remember how it started: You said we need this StructuredData refactoring.
 thoralf	That's why I'm confused.
 sonne|osx	thoralf: yeah but that was before you realized that you need refcounting
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Btw. I found method stubs deep_copy() and a shallow_copy() in CSGObject.
 thoralf	They are not used.
 thoralf	Remove them?
 sonne|osx	thoralf: not used at all? then remove them.
 thoralf	The stubs are SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED, not nowhere overridden.
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1771
 thoralf	SG_SGCDEBUG("unref() refcount %ld obj %s (%p) decreased\n", count, this->get_name(), this)
 thoralf	sonne|osx:
 thoralf	get_name() is required in SGRefObject ;)
 sonne|osx	thoralf: that was only for debugging :/
 sonne|osx	but hmmh don't see any better option
 thoralf	No, I found shallow_copy() implemented in RelaxedTree.
 thoralf	and GaussianKernel
 sonne|osx	thoralf: but this can be in CSGObject
