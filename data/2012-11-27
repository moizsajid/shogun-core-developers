 K0stIa	hello, everybody!
 K0stIa	the example so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py stopped working. It does segmentation fault if you run the script for several times without exiting from python environment. The same problem appears if I am trying to extend DirectorStructuredModel, it does also segmentation fault if you run the same script for several times.

 wiking	K0stIa: mmm
 wiking	K0stIa: which version of shogun r u  usinf
 wiking	using?
 K0stIa	last version from github
 wiking	K0stIa: can u share the script?
 K0stIa	you made make file ?
 wiking	which?
 K0stIa	sorry :)
 K0stIa	you want me to show make file ?
 wiking	i'd like to test it but i need an example to test this problem with
 K0stIa	I see :)
 wiking	so if u can share me your script that does segfault
 K0stIa	yes :)
 K0stIa	wait a minute please
 wiking	that'd help me to debug the problem
 K0stIa	https://code.google.com/p/shogun-toolbox/source/browse/examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py?r=8be38323f2dc590295a2913cc5fc944d1fc1333c
 K0stIa	I run this file several times in ipython
 K0stIa	after third it throws exeption
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	ok i'll try that
 wiking	but why r u running this several times? :)
 K0stIa	well, the same problem appear if you want to run it for different lambda
 K0stIa	to make cross-validation
 wiking	ok i'll try it now
 K0stIa	this is just example which simulates my problem
 K0stIa	thanks
 K0stIa	btw: did you implement the director class for structure model ?
 wiking	noup
 K0stIa	do you know who did it ?
 wiking	but i've rewritten lately couple of parts of bmrm
 K0stIa	I need now bmrm :)
 K0stIa	and it was ok before...
 wiking	well maybe i've introduced a bug :(
 K0stIa	so maybe the problem is there ?
 wiking	i'll check it for you
 K0stIa	thanks a lot :)
 wiking	i've done tests with it
 K0stIa	ok :)
 wiking	but i haven't done it with neither python
 wiking	nor trying to run it several times
 wiking	although i run it several times
 wiking	in a different setup
 wiking	and i haven't noticed any problems
 K0stIa	please, check this script :)
 wiking	yeah i'll do
 wiking	i use bmrm via c++
 wiking	but that shouldn't matter in this case anyways
 K0stIa	well, maybe it could
 wiking	soon we'll see.. i'm just recompiling shogun with python support
 K0stIa	please, recompile it also with director classes support
 wiking	btw
 wiking	u just start ipython and start fomr ther the script?
 wiking	*from
 K0stIa	i started ipythin, then did %run script.py several times
 K0stIa	and it did segmentation fault
 K0stIa	the same things appears in my working script
 wiking	ok
 K0stIa	which I can not share :(
 wiking	secret? :)
 K0stIa	kind of :P
 wiking	how come? :)
 K0stIa	no :) it will take a time to make it independent :)
 K0stIa	and I don't have it know
 K0stIa	I detected the problem
 wiking	?
 wiking	independent?
 K0stIa	yep :)
 wiking	dont understand :)
 K0stIa	well, i would have to share some files in addition for you :) and that I don't want :)
 wiking	i see
 wiking	what context are u using this for?
 wiking	i mean shogun
 wiking	or that's unshareable information
 K0stIa	I use it in my work on paper now :)
 K0stIa	for learning :)
 wiking	ah so u r using it for research
 K0stIa	yes
 K0stIa	I also have some suggestion for some improvements for structure output learning
 wiking	we are listening
 wiking	the reason i'm running it several times is because i use these algos to do latent structural classification...
 wiking	mmm i'm getting this error: SystemError: [ERROR] FATAL: Parameter::add_type(): Double parameter `m_TolRel'!
 wiking	i'm having some patches already prepared to for a bit better API of SO learning
 K0stIa	it would be nice to provide in director class possibility to override the the risk funtion
 wiking	well the risk function is soon to be changed
 wiking	as i've just commited a non-convex risk minimizer
 wiking	so that u don't have to do funky things if u want to minimize an concave risk function
 K0stIa	will it be possible to override the risk function ?
 wiking	well yeah
 K0stIa	that's nice
 wiking	what's your risk function now?
 wiking	or that's secret as well?
 K0stIa	no :)
 wiking	ok i have totally different problem now: SystemError: [ERROR] FATAL: Parameter::add_type(): Double parameter `m_TolRel'!
 K0stIa	it's risk approximation for supervised learning
 K0stIa	which is convex
 wiking	i see it's cool
 wiking	hope you'll share it
 wiking	when u have the paper done
 K0stIa	btw: which algorithm is implemented in your non-convex ?
 wiking	it's simply solving
 wiking	1/2 \lambda ||w||^2 + R(w)
 wiking	where R(w) could be anything
 wiking	it's based on libqp
 K0stIa	it's known approximation... you can find it in SO related papers
 K0stIa	is there some paper about it ?
 wiking	not yet
 wiking	i'm preparing one
 K0stIa	I see :)
 K0stIa	what is the class of functions that algorithm works for ?
 wiking	libncbm.cpp
 wiking	it's in structure
 K0stIa	I mean for with type of risk functions it could be applied ?
 wiking	no python api for it
 K0stIa	*which
 wiking	any risk function
 wiking	currently it's bundled to structured model
 wiking	so you would need to give a structured model with your desired risk function
 K0stIa	really ? for any nonconvex function it will find a global optima ?
 wiking	should
 wiking	worked for me
 wiking	at least for 2 problems
 wiking	that are non-convex
 K0stIa	can you say what they problems are ?
 wiking	well i'm applying this in computer vision
 wiking	so the problems are from that field
 wiking	ok i think ishould switch to master branch
 K0stIa	do you have any proof about guarantees ?
 wiking	as i already have some other patches in my local branch and i get totally different
 wiking	errors
 wiking	K0stIa: you mean about the convergence
 wiking	yes
 K0stIa	it would be interesting to see you r paper
 wiking	well it's not published
 wiking	it's not even submitted
 wiking	:D
 K0stIa	and now can you do something with that bugs ?
 wiking	well i'm trying to reproduce it first
 wiking	but i'm getting very different errors
 wiking	but i'm guessing it's because of the local patches i've done
 K0stIa	well, could you try to install version from github  ?
 K0stIa	without patches ?
 K0stIa	maybe there are some another bugs ?
 wiking	yeah that's what i'm trying
 K0stIa	good :)
 wiking	K0stIa: well i'm running now for the 5th time
 wiking	no segfault yet
 K0stIa	really ?
 K0stIa	you tried the same example ?
 K0stIa	several times ?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	%run so_multiclass_BMRM.py
 K0stIa	should be %run so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py
 wiking	ok
 wiking	this one segfaulted
 wiking	i'll gdb it
 K0stIa	thanks
 K0stIa	wiking: how it goes ?
@sonney2k	wiking, is there any reason for this ::vec1_plus_scalar_times_vec2 function in SGVector
 K0stIa	sonney2k: hi, who is responsible for doing director class for structured model ?
 K0stIa	could he change oracle for structured model in the following way, the oracle should be represented as an interface  and user should provide function which takes point and returns function value and subgradient ?
@sonney2k	K0stIa, n4nd0 did this.
@sonney2k	K0stIa, and gsomix is the master who made it possible...
 K0stIa	sonney2k: now it is a bit confusing... one has to pass some loss function to the svm, however loss is not needed, which is not that crucial for me, but I guess it would be better to get rid of it.
@sonney2k	K0stIa, well ask on the mailinglist if he doesn't appear here before you leave.
 K0stIa	sonney2k: for structured learning now it is not that convenient as it could be,
 K0stIa	1. the summation in case of learning more than one example is done inside shogun, I think it would be better if user do this summation, because this is something with is hard to compute and could be easily paralyzed. One can do it now of course, however is not convenient as it could be. that's why I think this director class should be as follows, just an interface with risk function that takes point from R^n space and returns function va

 wiking	K0stIa: u know that u can do it and submit a PR, right? :
 wiking	:)
 wiking	K0stIa: pr = pull request
 wiking	sonney2k: i think ccsosvm broke... aint' working anymore for me :(
 K0stIa	wiking:  I haven't been working on it. It could take time for me which I don't have now.
 wiking	K0stIa: well yeah that's a usual problem for everybody :(
 wiking	time i mean
 blackburn	wiking: I was reading logs and don't you find strange you can find global maxima of non-convex function?
 wiking	blackburn: why? :)
 wiking	and not global maxima
 wiking	but minima
 blackburn	it is the same
 wiking	yeah indeed
 wiking	argh
 wiking	now i have to cherry pick this stuff :(
 wiking	bisect is my friend
 wiking	K0stIa: maybe you could use bisect to find out which commit introduced this bug if it used to work before...
 wiking	would be great if we would have unittests for this :)
 wiking	could run bisect automatically
 wiking	ahahah http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/27/google_raters_manual/

 wiking	sonney2k: that patch of yours for std::vector is not working
 wiking	so there's something wrong with DynArray afaik
 naywhayare	sonney2k: curious question; was there a particular reason you settled on buildbot as a CI tool?
 naywhayare	I don't necessarily have a better suggestion or anything, just, curious, is all
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] lisitsyn pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/315b058291d6d0ad9ddc1e8b791f53d6e7938615
-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 315b058 Sergey Lisitsyn: Flexible director risk
@sonney2k	naywhayare, no I just tried it out first and it was python so I could easily extend it to my needs.
@sonney2k	wiking, what happens?
@sonney2k	wiking, re SGVector I meant why not do template specializations instead of overloading? I am currently changing the code to do exactly that
@sonney2k	wiking, I am a bit fed up with the get_uint_matrix etc functions and try to do overloading for that stuff now too...
 wiking	sonney2k: dunno what happens currently... i'm just saying that std::vector -> DynArray introduced a bug that basically the whole CCSOSVM doesn't work
@sonney2k	wiking, well if you had I test or at least an example then I could check
@sonney2k	this way you have to figure out what is wrong
 naywhayare	ok.  thanks for the answer :)
 wiking	sonney2k: do u have mosek?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	naywhayare, he - well and all issues I had were resolved in #buildbot - IIRC tomprince helped a lot and basically immediately
@sonney2k	or at the GSoC mentors summit FWIW
 naywhayare	ah, that's convenient
 naywhayare	I use Jenkins and have had decent success with it, but it's one of those things where I haven't had the time to set it up properly
 naywhayare	I'll keep buildbot in consideration for the future when I have infinite free time
 naywhayare	which unfortunately seems infinitely far away...
 wiking	sonney2k: i've just changed back to std::vector and it works perfectly... :S
 wiking	so i dont know what happens with DynArray actually
 wiking	as i really just changed 3 things. definition of the variable
 wiking	and resize_array -> resize
 wiking	so most probably there's a bug in DynArray :(
@sonney2k	naywhayare, I also have good experience with jenkins
@sonney2k	wiking, what does valgrind say?
 wiking	sonney2k: i cannot valgrind it, as valgrind is broken currently on my os :(
@sonney2k	wiking, this makes us a perfect team :-/
 wiking	hehhe

@sonney2k	wiking, the only idea I have is that we add some small example in examples/undocumented/library_dynarray.cpp that uses SGVectors...
@sonney2k	which I guess might be the issue
 wiking	ok i've pushed a pr
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] vigsterkr opened pull request #839: CCSOSVM refactoring (master...so-dev)  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/839
 wiking	it's a code refactor anyways of CCSOSVM
 wiking	and currently switches back to std::vector
 wiking	so don't merge it until we don't find out the dynarray stuff
 wiking	and then i'll do a little commit for this PR
 wiking	that switches back to dynarray
@sonney2k	I am currently deep in refactoring hell
 wiking	that's ok
 wiking	;)
 wiking	this can sit there for some time
@sonney2k	hah it looks like it compiles
 wiking	mmm
@sonney2k	wiking, so now we can just use SGVector.load
 wiking	what happened to travis?
@sonney2k	SGMatrix.load etc
@sonney2k	and no more need for tons of defines

 wiking	crazybrokenness
 wiking	:>
@sonney2k	blackburn, you broke it all :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: can't really understand the error
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am fixing the csharp one
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	but the other?
 blackburn	other like?
@sonney2k	other error
@sonney2k	cygwin!
 blackburn	which one/
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/445/steps/compile/logs/stdio
 blackburn	it makes no sense to me
 blackburn	at all
@sonney2k	at least it has to do with your commit :)
 blackburn	12 people in room
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	heiko: !
@sonney2k	ugh csharp compiles here
 heiko	blackburn, hi :)
 blackburn	heiko: long time no see as sonney2k likes to say
 heiko	blackburn, yes he would be right
 heiko	busy weeks here
 heiko	how are you?
@sonney2k	heiko, trying to rescue the world from evil?
 heiko	sonney2k, I did, but usually nobody notices
 heiko	everything going alright here?
@sonney2k	thats the destiny of super heros
 heiko	hehe ;)
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, no just first few weeks of new job, and its all a bit different than expected so I had lots of things to do
 heiko	currently in Cambridge
 heiko	next week in Warsaw
@sonney2k	heiko, we are tying hard to break all code - but it is not as easy ;-)
 heiko	project ends with this year thank god
 heiko	sonney2k, sounds good ;)
 blackburn	yeah I use axe
 blackburn	to break everything
 blackburn	but it still works sometimes
@sonney2k	heiko, but back in germany next year then?
@sonney2k	blackburn, csharp just compiles here!?
 heiko	sonney2k, no, I will stay in London
@sonney2k	oh different job?
@sonney2k	not the GP classification one?
 heiko	sonney2k, well currently I have to finish a EU project with a company where GPs are used, but since so little time left, I just need to collect stuff - so no time for shogun implementation
 heiko	but next year I will continue working in the stats department, but doing research
 blackburn	I start on new job next week starting from monday

-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 1d57638 Soeren Sonnenburg: include lib common to make data types know
 heiko	and then, the cool MCMC stuff with GPs will happen - hopefully
@sonney2k	heiko, sounds more like you won't have time either :/
 heiko	no I think it will be better since no grant project deadlines
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you ever thought it will be better some day? ;)
 heiko	they basically did nothing during the summer and now I am supposed to do all the stuff
@sonney2k	heiko, poor slave
@sonney2k	so rescuing the world indeed!
 heiko	sonney2k, yeah a bit annoying, but at least I can do traveling and get a salary - and its interesting stuff in any way, so learning...
 blackburn	sounds like my thought when I got into netcracker :D
 wiking	yo
@sonney2k	heiko, I hope you will find the time to add GPC to shogun - now that you've done this stuff once you should probably know best how to do it right :)
 wiking	where should be the structure machines be defined?
 wiking	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	wiking, what?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes I will do that for sure, implemented a lot of stuff in matlab recently
 wiking	sonney2k: currently structured machines doesn't have a type
 heiko	multi-class GPs, approximate inference, approximate exact inference, cool stuff
 wiking	sonney2k: EMachineType
 heiko	but currently only hacks,
@sonney2k	wiking, shogun/machines/StructuredOutputMachine.h ?
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	also there
 wiking	sonney2k: they just have problem type
 wiking	sonney2k: but i cannot differentiate the different SO machine implementations
 wiking	only if i try try catch dynamic csat
 wiking	cast
 wiking	sonney2k: or of course get_name + strcmp ;)
 heiko	currently seeing christians pydata talk

@sonney2k	there are still a few warnings
 wiking	sonney2k: so?
 wiking	sonney2k: (this is not a so about the warning but the machines..)
@sonney2k	wiking, in your code.
 wiking	sonney2k:  i know that i see that :)
@sonney2k	wiking, feel free to just add to EMachineType in shogun/machine/Machine.h
