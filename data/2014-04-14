 lisitsyn	yeah something is b0rken here
 thoralf	I already fixed it.
 thoralf	I'll merge tomorrow.
 thoralf	But everytime I try to do something MLish, this happens to me.
 thoralf	Wrong results, debugging, pen-and-paper tests and realizing the numbers are wrong.
 thoralf	(not my numbers)
 lisitsyn	though I remember there was an assumption about that :)

 thoralf	My patch includes a check for this assumption.
 thoralf	Checking for is_sorted is cheap if you can do multiplication in O(n) then. ;)

 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hey
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: theo's benn pretty busy lately
 lisitsyn	been*
 lisitsyn	so we get a bit out of touch :D
 lisitsyn	I wanted to ask you what is your plan
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: suggested that we can improve notebook a bit
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: so we can discuss what can be improved maybe?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I was going to implement dropout and max-norm regularization, but if you have any suggestions on the notebook, we could try to improve it first
 lisitsyn	oh already dropout things
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	ok it is pretty brief now
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: may be we could visualize learned layers somehow?
 lisitsyn	that would be super cool
 lisitsyn	have you seen hinton diagram?
 khalednasr	yeah
 lisitsyn	http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/HintonDiagrams
 khalednasr	but i'm not sure it would look very good
 lisitsyn	why?
 khalednasr	since the hidden layers are not sparse or pretrained or anything
 lisitsyn	yeah you're probably right
 lisitsyn	ok so we need convolution layer to have cool visualizations
 khalednasr	it might be better with dropout though
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: does dropout lead to some sparsity?
 khalednasr	yeah
 khalednasr	http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/msc_thesis.pdf
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: what is probably missed in the notebook
 lisitsyn	you create layers
 lisitsyn	but no mention how do they interconnect
 lisitsyn	btw is it always like all to all?
 khalednasr	so far, yeah
 khalednasr	I guess i should mention that in the documentation and notebook
 lisitsyn	yeah probably
 lisitsyn	okay if you find something that can explain the architecture of network you created
 lisitsyn	that would be cool
 lisitsyn	some simple plot that gives an idea how the network looks like
 lisitsyn	next
 lisitsyn	I am afraid it makes sense to explain that regularization is here because of overfitting and so on
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	sorry :D
 lisitsyn	ok then may be it makes sense
 lisitsyn	to say why it helps to avoid overfitting
 lisitsyn	maybe even learn a model w/o L2
 lisitsyn	it also makes sense to output how much time does it take (when rendered)
 lisitsyn	and how many epochs or whatever
 khalednasr	maybe after I do dropout, i can compare the performance of different regularization methods
 lisitsyn	do you plan to extend this notebook?
 lisitsyn	or another one for dropout?
 khalednasr	I think it would be better to just extend this one
 lisitsyn	alright
 khalednasr	It's already pretty short
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: okay and another point
 lisitsyn	may be cross validation here would be better
 lisitsyn	so we can really estimate how do they infer
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: HeikoS1 wanted to give some comments too
 lisitsyn	so we can improve it gradually
 khalednasr	yeah sure

 lisitsyn	tag is templated so you it is typesafe
 lisitsyn	Tag<int>
 lisitsyn	you can't do
 lisitsyn	get(Tag<int> tag)
 lisitsyn	and get anything else than int
 lambday	alrighty
 lisitsyn	set(Tag<int> tag, int value) is the only available method as well
 lisitsyn	so typesafety thing is solved
 lisitsyn	lambday: about plugins
 lisitsyn	lambday: each plugin exports a method
 lisitsyn	that returns its manifest
 lisitsyn	manifest is a collection of Class instances
 lisitsyn	Class<T>
 lisitsyn	Class<SVM> is some class that inherits SVM
 lisitsyn	it can spawn its instance as SVM
 lambday	aha!
 lisitsyn	this is how I want to resolve plugin problem
 lisitsyn	we declare base classes
 lisitsyn	so basically we can't add new 'functionality'
