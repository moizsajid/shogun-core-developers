 Ron__	Hi - just installed shogun on my Mac, am getting "ImportError: No module named sg" (or shogun or shogun.Features) in python. Can someone help me figure this out?
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	where have u seen that example?
 Ron__	In the tutorial section on static python, IIRC
@wiking	why are you trying to use python static?
 Ron__	That was just the first example I tried - but also because the convolutional autoencoder thing  I REALLY want to use had /static/ in its URL
@wiking	you should try to use python modular
@wiking	i doubt actually the autoencoder is enabled in the static python interface
 Ron__	OK, Brought up the notebook interface and put in stuff from demo notebook. Getting ----> 4 from modshogun import RealFeatures, MulticlassLabels, Math  ImportError: No module named modshogun
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	well you'll need python modular interface compiled for that
@wiking	and have it in PYTHONPATH
 Ron__	OK, any docs on that?  What do I need to do beyond the port install shogun from the docs?
@wiking	?
@wiking	you are tyring to install it as macports?
 Ron__	Yes. That was what I saw in the install instructions.
@wiking	where?
 Ron__	just a sec...
 Ron__	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/installation.html,   section on Mac OS
@wiking	ok we need to clear up doxygen :<
 Ron__	BUmmer.
@wiking	so basically you need to follow this
 Ron__	Guess I should install from source?
 Ron__	go ahead
@wiking	yes
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
 Ron__	OK, I will do that then.
 Ron__	Thanks
@wiking	and enable modular interface
@wiking	nw
 Ron__	OK. Bye. Looking forward to using the conv. autoenc.  Looks neat!

 silhoette	Hi guys, I'm having trouble running any program after installing shogun 3.2.0 on my Ubuntu14.04..I think I did have no trouble doing configure, make and make install. But when it comes to running an experimental program, it returns error msg: "ImportError: No module named sg"
 silhoette	i'm totally new to shogun & linux, can anybody help me? thank u
 silhoette	By executing the following on my terminal: $ mkdir build && cd build  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" -DPythonStatic=ON .. $ make $ sudo make install
 silhoette	but sg.so file wasn't created so i can't run the python-static examples
 silhoette	was anything wrong i've done in the install ?
