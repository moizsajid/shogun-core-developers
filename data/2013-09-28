 van51	sonney2k: made a PR about that : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1688
 van51	sonney2k: I still have trouble evaluating.. after the svm is trained it can't convert 10k examples
 van51	sonney2k: how had you managed to test it on 100k examples? were you loading them by chunks or something? :p

 hushell	iglesiasg: hey!
 hushell	iglesiasg: saw you comments
@iglesiasg	hushell, hi there
 hushell	iglesiasg: so you prefer ref and unref?
 hushell	hushell: well, you are right, we should keep model away from features and labels somehow
 hushell	iglesiasg: sorry, why I say to myself :p
@iglesiasg	hushell, I think that method is sort of weird because it is a getter for a thing that is not an attribute
@iglesiasg	hushell, and there is also this fact of model separated from features and labels
@iglesiasg	hushell, but as I said, I think we are spending more time than required for this detail so use your best judgement about it to take the decision :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: well, I'd like to follow your suggestion
 hushell	iglesiasg: let me change this function and commit again
@iglesiasg	hushell, please rebase upstream develop too
 hushell	iglesiasg: I have correct my notebook as well in terms of your review :) I'll commit after this PR
 hushell	iglesiasg: okay
@iglesiasg	hushell, also, are Patrick's comments already addressed?
@iglesiasg	not for the notebook, but the SGD
 hushell	iglesiasg: most of them, but the SOSVMHelper class is a general one, so I'd keep the dual functions for BCFW
@iglesiasg	hushell, ok

@sonney2k	hey gsomix!
 gsomix	sonney2k, hey.
@sonney2k	gsomix, do you have some time to try out the matlab stuff?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. looking library right now
@sonney2k	gsomix, cool!
@sonney2k	wiking, why do all notebooks fail again :(
@sonney2k	gsomix, when the lib works you should do a CMatlabFile.h the same way the HDF5File is done
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
@sonney2k	gsomix, to be clear - .mat files can contain arbitrarily many variables
@sonney2k	gsomix, so with shogun one could just load one - and you just specify the name
@sonney2k	e.g. CMatlabFile(char* fname, char rw='r', const char* name);
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw the same thing would be doable with .csv files - I mean we could allow loading just certain columns
@sonney2k	anyways have a look first :)
@sonney2k	wiking, trying to fix ...

@sonney2k	gsomix, what can it do so far?
@sonney2k	gsomix, and which file are you looking at? wasn't it just 1 file?
 gsomix	sonney2k, MatlabIO.{h,c}pp, MatlabIOContainer.hpp
@sonney2k	gsomix, link please
 gsomix	freakin' Chrome!
 gsomix	just a moment
 gsomix	sonney2k, https://github.com/hbristow/cvmatio/blob/master/src/MatlabIO.cpp
 gsomix	unexpected crash
 gsomix	https://github.com/hbristow/cvmatio/tree/master/include
 gsomix	sonney2k, as you see this library uses boost::any and cv::Mat
 gsomix	sonney2k, so there are some methods like MatlabIO::constructMatrix for data types.
@sonney2k	gsomix, I see them
@sonney2k	gsomix, I didnt' see yet where it uses cv's mat
@sonney2k	gsomix, any idea what boost any is doing?
@sonney2k	seems like the only 'heavy' dependency
 gsomix	sonney2k, lisitsyn expain better, than me about any, huh :)
 gsomix	I just have consulted with him
 gsomix	*explain
 lisitsyn	well I implemented any by myself once
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what is it?
 gsomix	sonney2k, about cs::Mat. look at  MatlabIO::constructMatrix, line 352
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: value with arbitrary type
 gsomix	*cv::Mat
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it can be casted back with any_cast
 lisitsyn	int a = 3;
 lisitsyn	any aa = a;
 lisitsyn	int b = any_cast<int>(aa);
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, sth like void ptr underneath?
 lisitsyn	yes basically void ptr
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it holds type though, that's the essential trick here
 gsomix	sonney2k, http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/basic_structures.html?highlight=mat#Mat
@sonney2k	gsomix, cv::Mat seams easy to replace
@sonney2k	not boost::any
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
@sonney2k	having a dependency on boost is a massive thing
@sonney2k	so if possible try to do w/o
 gsomix	sonney2k, I can redesign methods of MatlabIOContainer and MatlabIO.
 gsomix	just need figure out how :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, it seems like any is just needed in the container
@sonney2k	nowhere else
 gsomix	sonney2k, indeed
@sonney2k	gsomix, the way I would do it:
@sonney2k	1) fork cvmatio
@sonney2k	2) make it work w/o boost
 lisitsyn	I have small any around
@sonney2k	yeah use lisitsyn's if you want
@sonney2k	3) then replace cv::mat with shogun data types where needed and link (externally against libshogun) for that
 lisitsyn	not mine though ;)
@sonney2k	4) put the required code under shogun tree in external
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, license?
 lisitsyn	boost 1.0
@sonney2k	5) write CMatlabFile
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, does that make sense?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yes.
