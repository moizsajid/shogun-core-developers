 van51	hello
 van51	sonne|work: about your comment on the Tokenizer classes. I get what you;re saying, but I wanted to be able to use a custom Tokenizer and an n-gram Tokenizer interchangeably in the same workflow
 sonne|work	yes but that would work right?
 sonne|work	NGramTokenizer & DelimiterTokenizer?
 sonne|work	van51: ^
 van51	sonne|work: yeah it would work I believe
 van51	sonne|work: although now I'm confused as to whether you meant to maintain just one class of Tokenizers (what I understood) or to have the WhiteSpaceTokenizer I made into a DelimiterTokenizer
 sonne|work	yes whitespacetokenizer -> delimitertokenizer
 van51	sonne|work: ok then :)
 van51	going to make some coffee and start coding :D

@HeikoS	lambday: heya! :)
 lambday	how are you??
@HeikoS	lambday: pretty good :)
@HeikoS	and yourself?
 lambday	am good too :)
 lambday	and the trip?
 lambday	how many kms did you travel total?
@HeikoS	lambday: was very nice
@HeikoS	we did about 75km a day on average
@HeikoS	5 days
 lambday	great!!! :-o
 lambday	in england?
@HeikoS	no Germany
@HeikoS	"M?nsterland"
@HeikoS	nice area
@HeikoS	lots of lakes, rivers and woods
@HeikoS	and it rained every day
 lambday	ah..classic! may be we'll get to see some photos :)
 lambday	lol @10^6 emails :P
@HeikoS	lambday: no photos made
@HeikoS	just pure cycling
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah emails are quite a bit
 lambday	hmm...
@HeikoS	spending the early morning on working thorugh them :)
@HeikoS	liked your patches
@HeikoS	looks like the general framework is well set up
 lambday	thanks... by the way, I thought of making it uint64_t (m_dimension) but then changed it, what do you think?
 lambday	yeah!
 lambday	can't wait to see it working for approximation case
@HeikoS	lambday: I dont know, maybe leave it for now
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	2^31 -1 is quite a bit already
 lambday	hmm
 lambday	I coded up CLinearSolver and CDirectLinearSolverComplex...
 lambday	shall I send the PR now?
@HeikoS	lambday: nice, yeah show me what you got
 lambday	okay... sending
 lambday	HeikoS: sent
@HeikoS	lambday: what solver is this?
 lambday	llt
@HeikoS	llt
@HeikoS	so only PSD matrices
 lambday	yes
@HeikoS	we should somehow reflect this in the same
@HeikoS	or even a different approiach:
@HeikoS	there should be an enum to select how to solve the system
 lambday	and we initialize it in the constructor
@HeikoS	I suggest: Cholesky, QR-no permutation, QR-col-permutation, QR-full-permutation, and SVD
@HeikoS	its only for dense matrices right?
 lambday	yes
@HeikoS	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicLinearAlgebraDecompositions.html
 lambday	okay..
@HeikoS	lambday: sorry to make this more complicated
@HeikoS	but then we are on the safe side
@HeikoS	SVD being ultra stable
@HeikoS	QR being tradeoff between fast and accurate
@HeikoS	and for PSD LLT is both
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah... okay.. so, solve will have switch cases, and depending on some enum EDirectSolverType, it will use corresponding solvers
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, that should be minor code changes since its all in eigen3
@HeikoS	just the enum
@HeikoS	and init it to LLT
@HeikoS	cholesky
 lambday	HeikoS: alright..
@HeikoS	lambday: oh and make sure you use the rank-revealing features of eigen
@HeikoS	e.g. llt fails if matrix is not psd
@HeikoS	lambday: gotta make a phone call, be back in a few minutes
 lambday	HeikoS: okay, I'm checking
 thoralf	HeikoS: Is your eclipse confused by "#ifndef _XXX__H__" and greys the whole class?
@HeikoS	thoralf: which file?
 thoralf	HeikoS: _BINARY_LABELS__H__
 thoralf	HeikoS: BinaryLabels.h
@HeikoS	thoralf: checking ...
 thoralf	HeikoS: But it also affects other files.
@HeikoS	thoralf: yes
 thoralf	HeikoS: Adding another underscore to the define fixes this, but I don't know why.
@HeikoS	thoralf: wow I always completely ignored/not noticed that :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: This also affects auto completion.
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-408350.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	thoralf: there should be no underscore at the beginning of defines anyway
@HeikoS	c++ style standard
@HeikoS	removing also makes it non-gray
@HeikoS	thoralf: how is eclipse going apart from that?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Sorry, don't understand the question.
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's the standard stating that ;)
 thoralf	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=313933
 thoralf	Seems related.

 thoralf	I don't understand MulticlassMachine::get_submachine_outputs() - how is it possible to call (CMachine*)machine->apply_binary() without arguments?
 thoralf	I can only find implementations with signature "CBinaryLabels* apply_binary(CFeatures *)"
 thoralf	Am I missing something?
@iglesiasg	thoralf, a machine has a CFeatures* member
@iglesiasg	if apply is called without arguments, then these ones are used
@iglesiasg	check the signature in the headers, they should be with a default argument
@iglesiasg	something like  apply_binary(CFeatures* features = NULL)

 pickle27	for the record here is my solution http://pastebin.com/hNNNf4nc
 pickle27	I'm loading a csv file created from R, its a 10x300 csv and I need to load it and re shape it into a 10x10x30 ndarray
 lambday	HeikoS: there??
 pickle27	if anyone has an idea for a better solution I'd love to see it
@HeikoS	lambday: yep, hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: except FullPivHouseholderQR, everything else seems to fail for even a small matrix for complex
 lambday	the matrix I am testing with is
 lambday	2, 1+2i
 lisitsyn	pickle27: so you are loading 3d matrix?
 lambday	1+2i, 3
-!- zxtx [~zv@12.231.120.253] has joined #shogun

@HeikoS	lambday: do real matrices work?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: R flattens it for you though
@HeikoS	did you check the condition number?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: so I need to re form it in 3D
@HeikoS	oh well thats small
 lambday	1.7705
@HeikoS	I mean small matrix
@HeikoS	real matrices?
 lambday	for real, llt works
 lambday	(I mean, just keeping the complex part 0)
 lambday	rest, I wanted it to work with complex
 lambday	oh, and we'll have complex in the diagonal
@HeikoS	is there some documentation for eigen's complex solvers?
 lambday	so no use of using LLT at all
 lambday	HeikoS: not that I ran into.. specific complex cases are there for eigensolvers
 lambday	m\b gives
 lambday	0.26804 - 0.10309i
 lambday	   0.17526 - 0.14433i
@HeikoS	octave I assume?
 lambday	yep
 lambday	I didn't make this class template cause we'll only use it for complex purpose
 lambday	is that okay?
 pickle27	I realize that CAsciiFile was done writing a column to a row for efficiency but its sometimes kind of inconvenient no?
@HeikoS	lambday: dont know
@HeikoS	I think yes
@HeikoS	there is a talk here now, will be back in 1 hr, sorry
 lambday	HeikoS: no problem :)
@HeikoS	lambday: I was wrong, no talk now, but in 30 mins
 lambday	HeikoS: okay :)

 lambday	hermitian
@HeikoS	lambday: yep
 lambday	so, we'll have complex shifts... which will be in the diagonal
 lambday	that will make it non-hermitian

@HeikoS	lambday: the direct solvers are more or less only for debuggin right?
 lambday	umm... yeah
-!- gsomix [~Miranda@37.61.181.106] has joined #shogun
 lambday	sort of...
 lambday	I mean, they will almost never be used
 lambday	we'll use preconditioned CG, so
 gsomix	good evening?
@HeikoS	lambday: then just go for svd
 lambday	that doesn't work :(
 lambday	QR-full does
@HeikoS	do it via the enum (so it can be extended, maybe well add QR)
@HeikoS	what does svd tell you?
 lambday	svd gives an answer though..
 lambday	but that's not correct
@HeikoS	lambday: which answer?
 lambday	solution vec
@HeikoS	and that is wrong???
 lambday	(Ax-b).norm/b.norm = 0.7 something
 lambday	JacobiSVD
@HeikoS	which dimension?
@HeikoS	wow
@HeikoS	that sucks
 lambday	2x2
@HeikoS	no that cannot be
@HeikoS	maybe an issue with complex number operators?
 lambday	ours
 lambday	?
@HeikoS	yes, how does eigen store complex matrices?
 lambday	using std::complex only
 lambday	and full-perm QR works just fine
@HeikoS	lambday: its weird, SVD has the best accuracy of all algorithms
@HeikoS	optimal one
@HeikoS	what does the full QR give?
 lambday	may be the complex version isn't working yet?
 lambday	umm
 lambday	rel error 0.0
 lambday	exactly what I get from octave
 lambday	(0.268041,-0.103093)
 lambday	(0.175258,-0.14433)
@HeikoS	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/Eigen2ToEigen3.html
@HeikoS	maybe this?
 lambday	0.26804 - 0.10309i
 lambday	   0.17526 - 0.14433i
 lambday	chekcing
@HeikoS	lambday: do you use solve of the SVD class or do you do that by hand?
@HeikoS	based on the factors?
 lambday	solve of the class..
 lambday	I am using JacobiSVD only, that's in Eigen3
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, since its not really important, just use the full QR then
 lambday	drop all the rest?
@HeikoS	but with an enum that can be changed and switch in the solve method
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	leave them in but add a warning or so
@HeikoS	we want this to work, but its not important now
 lambday	okay... so removing these testcases except full QR..
@HeikoS	lambday: make sure to try some other (larger) matrices
 lambday	okay
 lambday	I'm checking
@HeikoS	lambday: there must be an error somewhere since the SVD in eigen is stable
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe produce a small reproducable example and post it to the eigen3 forum
 lambday	HeikoS: okay..
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw eigen guys are sooo unhappy with the current svd implementation
@HeikoS	developers or users?

 lambday	HeikoS: something is weird.. I tested again and SVD, QR (all 3) works.. LLT fails however..
@HeikoS	lambday: which did you change?
@HeikoS	and what type of systems?
 lambday	pd.. same matrix
 lambday	complex
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-408350.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
 lambday	I'm adding separate tests for all these.. I must have done something wrong earlier
@HeikoS	lambday: well, that sounds good then :)
@HeikoS	since LLT cannot work anyways
 lambday	yeah!
 lambday	yep
 lambday	so, should we change the default to something else, svd
 lambday	?
@HeikoS	yeah SVD, or the half-pivot QR since eigen people dont like their svd, you can choose :)
 lambday	well, svd is slow
 lambday	so I am thinking qr
@HeikoS	lambday: okay then
@HeikoS	if its possible to choose, we dont hurt ourselves anyway
 lambday	yes
 lambday	:)
 lambday	HeikoS: updated
 lambday	could you please check it?

 van51	why does every SG_PRINT show tha name of the function?
 van51	i remember it being asked again but I don't remember seeing the answer
@HeikoS	van51: because we made it (for some reason)
@HeikoS	only debug is supposed to do this
@HeikoS	van51: feel free to change, its all in SGIO.h
 van51	HeikoS: okie :)
@HeikoS	lambday: there is no PR
@HeikoS	van51: seems weird to me btw :) only makes sense for error/warning/debug
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well about the print stuff I asked you if this is what you had in mind ...
@sonney2k	anyways HeikoS, lisitsyn around?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	time to finalize the program
@HeikoS	sonney2k: then we got each other wrong
@HeikoS	print should stay unchanged in my eyes
@HeikoS	but the others should not
@HeikoS	anyways
@HeikoS	lets talk about the workshop
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013_program
@sonney2k	that was what we had
@HeikoS	we dont have posters
 lambday	HeikoS: back
 lambday	HeikoS: I updated the same PR https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1190
@HeikoS	and we dont have user contributed talks
@HeikoS	so I suggest we remove them
@sonney2k	lambday, please postpone the discussion for 30 mins - thanks
@HeikoS	lambday: will have a look after this meeting
 lambday	sonney2k: okay.. no problem :)
 lambday	HeikoS: yes :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: alright let me put it into gdoc
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, IIRC we had that in gdoc
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: like spreadsheet?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg transferred this to the website
@HeikoS	sonney2k, lisitsyn how many talks will there be?
@HeikoS	one from each of us?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well how many speakers do we have?
@HeikoS	we have a google doc for that too
@HeikoS	wait
@HeikoS	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Amig4CX9mHQbdG1lQ1lNcDFsYUluZnA5ZDBiT0N1VHc
 lisitsyn	ooh these gdocs are unmanageable
@HeikoS	we have 5 people
@HeikoS	if gunnar comes
 lisitsyn	does gunnar come?
@HeikoS	and svm/mkl were two topics in the list that people voted for
@HeikoS	and GPS/ kernel-stats both were in there two
@sonney2k	sure
@HeikoS	so there is the potential for 5+2 talks
@HeikoS	where one is the intro from gunnar
@HeikoS	question is whether thats too much developer stuff
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no I meant when we did the planning we came up with some schedule IIRC
@sonney2k	but no idea where that is
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah I am trying to find it
@sonney2k	no idea it is gone I guess
 lisitsyn	strange
@HeikoS	doesnt matter too much does it?
@HeikoS	the one on the weppage is goog enough to do it now
@sonney2k	HeikoS, btw after this we need to do the PO number for GSoC money stuff btw
@sonney2k	HeikoS, true
@HeikoS	sonney sure
@HeikoS	so how many talks?
@HeikoS	we are mostly on our own anyways ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, now we have 29 rows btw
@HeikoS	nice
 lisitsyn	heh two from me
@HeikoS	the votes should not have changed too much though
@sonney2k	heh
 lisitsyn	referals :D
 lisitsyn	you may notice their russian names
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: the last one is vojtech's student!
 lisitsyn	originally from my city what a coincidence :D
@HeikoS	so again for the talks, no user talks, no posters, what to do instead?
@HeikoS	just have us talking and provide some space for discussions?
@HeikoS	and maybe hacking sessions?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes I think so
@sonney2k	HeikoS, it is actually not so bad we can have a more relaxed program
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, please post the current schedule in some gdoc
@HeikoS	Maybe the talks should end with some tasks that people could solve, to get their hands on some of the things
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: doing
@HeikoS	sonney2k: agreed
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah we can do some hands-on during / after the talks
@HeikoS	sonney2k: thats pretty nice then
@HeikoS	how long the talks?
@HeikoS	what to talk about?
@sonney2k	I would say about 40 mins then per talk
@HeikoS	sonney2k: thats long, we had 15 mins in the old schedule
@sonney2k	5 talks right?
@sonney2k	yes we squeezed it into 15
@HeikoS	what about some 30 mins and then another 30 mins for people to try things out?
@sonney2k	but now we can relax it
@HeikoS	(including breaks and setting up the next one)
@sonney2k	gunnar can do a 1 hour keynote
 lisitsyn	lets put a hour then
@HeikoS	sonney2k: question also is whether we combine some talk topics
@HeikoS	SVM/MKL can be combined right?
@HeikoS	but GPs/Kernel tests cannot :)
 lisitsyn	what is poster sessions?
@sonney2k	then each talk can contain the theory and already in the talk practical sessions
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, dead
 lisitsyn	right
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what do we do when having food?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes I can do all kinds of SVMs & MKL
@HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, eat !
 lisitsyn	just talk to each other I guess
 lisitsyn	well no poster sessions so just food
@sonney2k	and eat :D
@HeikoS	so 5hrs of talks/session
@HeikoS	including the keynote
@HeikoS	thats enough for a day
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: intensive shit
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	we will get out dying
@HeikoS	I suggest to do things relaxed
@HeikoS	take time in the talks etc
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes and turn on some bob marley songs
@sonney2k	yes not NIPS conference level for sure
@sonney2k	but really slow if possible
@HeikoS	dont know  that :D
@sonney2k	HeikoS, slow?
@sonney2k	always rushing heh?
@HeikoS	NIPS
@HeikoS	havent been there yet ;)
@sonney2k	this year right?
@HeikoS	nono, I am never rushing
@HeikoS	hopefully, we'll see
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, where is the doc?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: will share in a minute
@HeikoS	ok then with the intro/speeddating and the final discussion and lunch, thats a lot of stuff
@sonney2k	I woudl suggest we do 1 hour gunnar for the ML tutorial as a start
@HeikoS	maybe we should even go for 45 mins instead
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: HeikoS shared
@sonney2k	then directly lunch
@HeikoS	yep agreed
@HeikoS	what about this shogun in bioinformatics ?
@HeikoS	sonney2k you could talk about that during MKL/SVM maybe?
@HeikoS	the genome stuff you did
@sonney2k	then I we somehow have to do a basic shogun tutorial. basic as in what for / how to install / let people install
@sonney2k	maybe extend this with SVMs & MKL
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok
@HeikoS	no a seperate thing would be cool to have
@HeikoS	you probably have some talks about shogun on disc ?
@HeikoS	general overview etc
@sonney2k	no good ones
@HeikoS	still you are suited best for this one ;)
@sonney2k	maybe we can do this quickly in 15-30 mins
@HeikoS	btw in the SVM one you should mention some x-validation stuff since that is not talked about otherwise
@HeikoS	yep agreed
@sonney2k	then I am not sure what to do with the 4 tutorials
@HeikoS	30 mins then everyone can install
@HeikoS	what about having two-coffee-two?
@sonney2k	and we really need to have some discussions
@HeikoS	I suggest to do the talks not too long
@HeikoS	then afterwards there is room for discussion and to try
@HeikoS	trying out should only be reproducing things
@HeikoS	like one slide that is left on
@sonney2k	we have to know what we want to discuss about
@HeikoS	if the talk is only 35-40 mins, there is plenty of time
@sonney2k	as I've seen future of shogun is a topic
@HeikoS	just give some room after each talk I would say, and a guided one later on
@HeikoS	after the talks
@sonney2k	shogun development process the other
@HeikoS	sonney2k, yeah
@HeikoS	but that should be seperate afterwards dont you think?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  are you typing the times?
@sonney2k	and shogun in new environments
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well just draft to estimate
@HeikoS	I would do 1 hr slots for each talk/questions/session
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we have to mix this in
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: 1hr per talk?
@sonney2k	otherwise it is too much talks and people just fall asleep
 lisitsyn	sounds too much
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: not talking time but everything
@HeikoS	short break, try out the things maybe, ask some questions
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I agree, so what about two discussion sessions then?
 lisitsyn	I see no place for sessions then HeikoS?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes makes sense
@HeikoS	there should be some headroom for spontaneous discussions in my eyes
@HeikoS	so the 1 hr x 4 seems good
@HeikoS	+ 2x30 mins for diccussions
@HeikoS	maybe we set a red line for each of them
@HeikoS	first one should be more user-related, second one can be more dev-related
-!- iglesiasg [53b32c87@gateway/web/freenode/ip.83.179.44.135] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	and one coffee break can be combined with discussion?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I would say there are mostly users there
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: join our discussion
@sonney2k	HeikoS, maybe we have a coffee break just before the discussion
@HeikoS	sonney2k: my idea was just to put the stuff that mostly interests us to the end (if people want to go)
@sonney2k	other way round
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: that's why I am here :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well we have saturday & sunday for that too
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we should figure out what users want /expect
@HeikoS	then its pretty simple now
@HeikoS	sonney2k: well thats what the form was for right?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, open the gdoc and do the changes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no not helpful
@sonney2k	they only clicked points they kew
@HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	we gave them I mean
* sonney2k tired
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so then there should be a free slot maybe
@HeikoS	which we can fill by demand (optional)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I would do that in the coffee / lunch break / discussions
@HeikoS	what about putting the shogun intro before the lunch?
 iglesiasg	there won't be poster sessions at the end then?
 iglesiasg	none applied?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: nope ;)
 iglesiasg	too sad
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: are you up to show us some SO?
@HeikoS	we really should make sure that the tutorials are nice with lots of applications and pictures
@HeikoS	otherwise its too much
 lisitsyn	sure
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I could talk about how to do SO in Shogun
 iglesiasg	rather than SO in general since many people there will actually know more about it than me :D
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I think it should be a mix
 lisitsyn	well same holds for dimension reduction :D
@HeikoS	same holds for all gsoc projects :D
@HeikoS	but thats not bad
@HeikoS	I dont know any SO so happy to get an intro
@HeikoS	same with dimension reduction actually
@HeikoS	so does everyone agree with the schedule?
 lisitsyn	looks ok
@HeikoS	then we need to set the order of the talks
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we need to put names to the talks
@HeikoS	yep
@sonney2k	times are ok with everyone?
@HeikoS	I take the second :)
@sonney2k	I made tutorial 3 & 4 45 mins only
@sonney2k	the other 1 hour
@HeikoS	ah thats good then we can fit in the double ones in there
 iglesiasg	I think times are ok
@HeikoS	sonney2k: what do you think about this mixture of GPs and kernel mmd
@HeikoS	GPs are somehow very relatedto SVMs
@HeikoS	so might be a bit redundant
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no no
@HeikoS	?
 lisitsyn	nobody understands GPs
 lisitsyn	so please keep it
 lisitsyn	you and votjakovr may be
 lisitsyn	but not me
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	ok then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what do you think on the kernel MMD stuff?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, what was the prio list again
 iglesiasg	I will be able to re-use the slides from my final degree project presentation for the tutorial :)
@sonney2k	for some reason I cannot find the doc
@sonney2k	HeikoS, but I would love to learn more about MMD too :D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I don't know
@HeikoS	I would like to talk aobut it since it is something new
@HeikoS	GPs and SVMs are quite mature already
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: would be nice if you take a look at most methods as MKL cases
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the mature stuff is of course the one practitioners are interested in and the researchers want the new stuff
 lisitsyn	I mean lasso is MKL
@HeikoS	sonney2k: sure
 lisitsyn	deep learning is mkl
 lisitsyn	etc
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no deep learning is not (not convex like mkl and certainly more layers)
 iglesiasg	https://www.dropbox.com/s/a0bolzzxgr669sg/fjig_pfc_slides.pdf
@HeikoS	so any suggestions for this clash?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah sure, jk
 iglesiasg	take a look guys in case you want to use any of the figures I have there ^
 iglesiasg	it is in Spanish but figures do not talk any language :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, you will give the talk
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes :D
 lisitsyn	did you know you are going to give a talk?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so just do it in english and add more shogun howto in there then you are good
 iglesiasg	sonney2k, lisitsyn yes
 iglesiasg	but for instance at the beginning I am talking there about SVMs
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well you could do 2 tutorials then
 iglesiasg	maybe sonney2k wants to use any of the figures there
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ahh that's what you mean
@HeikoS	too much
@HeikoS	or two short ones
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: :)
@HeikoS	Ill try that
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what if you do
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I will use shogun demos :D
 lisitsyn	SVM, GPs, MKL, MMD
 iglesiasg	sonney2k: all right ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, or GPs and an a brief MMD
-!- pickle27 [~kevin@rcv3-lab-pc.ee.queensu.ca] has joined #shogun
 iglesiasg	I have generated many there with Shogun anyway
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah thats fine
@sonney2k	anyway we have to finalize this now
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you put it live on the website again?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: maquina de vectores soporte!
@HeikoS	or maybe lets shift it to 90 mins for that one
@HeikoS	that its more relaxed
 iglesiasg	sonney2k: the new schedule you mean?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes
 iglesiasg	update workshop program, yes sure
@sonney2k	we should also make some announcement like program finalized
@HeikoS	1930 should be fine still
@sonney2k	and also instructions
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: maquina de vectores soporte rule them all :P
@sonney2k	we don't have the main hall that long
@sonney2k	there might be other events
 lisitsyn	where are we heading after 19.00?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, stay in c-base
@sonney2k	but grill outside
@HeikoS	ok then
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: do they have some yard?
 lisitsyn	or what?
@sonney2k	https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=c-base&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=yzbLUYesEcmctAbs64C4Dw&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1745&bih=830
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/7/7e/C-base-29.jpg
@sonney2k	that is actually directly in front of c-base
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ok some place outside
@sonney2k	http://blog.diediplomandin.de/wp-content/uploads/cbase051.jpg
@sonney2k	and that is the plan!
 iglesiasg	I think there is a c-base in budapest a bit diffirent than the one we are going to
@HeikoS	sonney2k, what about all the stuff we need (brill, meat, drinks, projector (?), cables, bla)
 lisitsyn	russian vodka?
 lisitsyn	hah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah of course :) but how to get it there and who and when
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well they have lots of stuff there
@sonney2k	but sure I have to buy quite a bit
@sonney2k	video recording is still hmm...
@HeikoS	sonney2k: as mentioned, I am in Berlin a few days earlier if you need help buying things
 lisitsyn	I am too :D
 lisitsyn	but what can I do is to get lost
 lisitsyn	that's the only thing I can do in berlin :D
@sonney2k	you are an experienced drinker too
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: HeikoS: anyone is up to meet *before* the event btw?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, wait you will in berlin from 10th of july?
@HeikoS	yes 10
@HeikoS	meeting some friends etc
@sonney2k	so what is missing in the schedule is a name to what we want to discuss in the discussion sessions
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I suggest the second one is the future
 lisitsyn	of shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, agreed
@HeikoS	first one dev-proces
 lisitsyn	and the first one may be usability
 lisitsyn	ha
@HeikoS	and usability yes
@sonney2k	ok change it then!
@HeikoS	that should be fine
@HeikoS	note I changed the times slightly for discussion 1(if you agree)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no
@sonney2k	Discussion should be extra
@sonney2k	not in coffee break
@HeikoS	changed
@sonney2k	HeikoS, if we are running late we just shorten the discussion/break
@HeikoS	yeah thats fine
@HeikoS	so all fine then=?
 lisitsyn	yes fine for me
@HeikoS	should we maybe introduce the devs in the shogun intro?
@HeikoS	5 mins each or so
 lisitsyn	too much!
@HeikoS	or 2
@HeikoS	just to let people know who we are
 lisitsyn	can we have badges?
@HeikoS	and maybe also say how we work together
@HeikoS	since thats quite special - we havent ever met each other
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: haven't you met Soeren?
@HeikoS	explains a lot of things in shogun ;)
@HeikoS	nope
 lisitsyn	oh so nobody ever met
 lisitsyn	that's what we call virtual
@sonney2k	ok schedule fixed right?
@HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	then iglesiasg please put this online!
@sonney2k	we should write some announcement for that then too
@sonney2k	and instructions how to get to c-base
@sonney2k	volunteers?
@HeikoS	who wrote the last ones?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what kind of announcement?
 lisitsyn	I wrote some email while ago you didn't like it may be we can re-use it?
@sonney2k	Once that is done we should send an email to the participants
@sonney2k	not really
@HeikoS	I can do this then
@sonney2k	that is where the hands on will be https://maps.google.de/maps?q=Marchstra%C3%9Fe+23&hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=h&hnear=Marchstra%C3%9Fe+23,+10587+Berlin&z=16
@HeikoS	sonney2k: you should do the way description since you know the place better
@sonney2k	room MAR 0.001
@sonney2k	HeikoS, just use google maps
@sonney2k	it really is enough
@HeikoS	well then no need to do that since people can do that on their own
@sonney2k	there are train / underground stations 2 mins away from everything
@HeikoS	I thought you meant description of way
 lisitsyn	oh close to me!
@HeikoS	like go there, turn left and jump up and down three times
@HeikoS	then a magical door opens

 van51	sonney2k: can I ask a couple things?
 van51	or someone else actually
 lisitsyn	van51: what's up?
 van51	lisitsyn: first of all, if I change the display of the histogram to that : http://pastebin.com/cbReK2Hn in Alphabet.cpp
 van51	is it good?
 lisitsyn	van51: what is changed?
 lisitsyn	Character is not in alphabet?
 van51	lisitsyn: instead of the char it used to print the index of the character
 van51	and what you sai
 van51	said*
 lisitsyn	like 59
 lisitsyn	instead of some letter?
 van51	yeap
 lisitsyn	like that indeed
 lisitsyn	I do I mean
 van51	so I leave it like this?
 lisitsyn	yes I don't mind such improvement
 van51	ok
 van51	one more thing
 van51	I changed the default behavior of SGIO that always printed the function name
 van51	like we discussed with HeikoS above
 shogun-buildbot	build #1148 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1148  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 van51	should I have it to set this function_name display automatically if the loglevel is set to >= warn?
 lisitsyn	van51: I don't know but I tend to think it is better to show these names only when debuggin
 van51	lisitsyn: actually now there are 3 possibilities, show nothing, show function name, show file and line

 lisitsyn	van51: may be it makes the sense to put an option like show line
@wiking	yo
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
 van51	lisitsyn: maybe I'll make a PR with these changes only and that would mean that the user could/should also specify what to display as well
 van51	and we can update it afterwards
 lisitsyn	alright
@sonney2k	van51, the hist['E'] is not a good idea
@sonney2k	think of '\n' as the char
@sonney2k	or other control characters
@sonney2k	van51, best is you try it with the full range 0..255
* sonney2k off
 van51	sonney2k: hmm idd
 lisitsyn	van51: I'd handle alphanumerical this way
 lisitsyn	number otherwise
 lisitsyn	and special like EOF and EOL
 lisitsyn	marked some way too
 lisitsyn	but that's me ;)

 van51	lisitsyn: yeah thankfully
 van51	I had a long if before
 lisitsyn	van51: let sonney2k merge it, I am totally happy with it
 lisitsyn	van51: ahh one more thing may be
 lisitsyn	van51: what about EOF and EOL? makes sense to state them too
 van51	lisitsyn: tell me
 lisitsyn	I don't remember any code of \n
 lisitsyn	so may be it would be more convenient for users too
