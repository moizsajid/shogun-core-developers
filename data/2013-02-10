 heiko1	sonney2k, wiking, around?
 heiko1	which of the gmock, gtest do I need to have the sources from?
 heiko1	and of which can I use the ubuntu package?
 n4nd0	heiko1: hey
 n4nd0	I think there's a package for gtest
 heiko1	n4nd0, hi!
 heiko1	I remember that wiking told me that I have to download one manually
 heiko1	but I forgot which one
 heiko1	 :)
 n4nd0	gmock probably
 n4nd0	I had to download that one too
 heiko1	ok
 heiko1	and use the ubuntu package libgtest-dev?
 n4nd0	mmm I am not sure, I am on arch and the package was called gtest
 heiko1	I see, well it compiled
 heiko1	make unittest does the magic right?
 n4nd0	I run make inside tests/unit/
 n4nd0	but wiking mentioned sth about make unit-test or so
 heiko1	ok
 n4nd0	unit-tests I think
 heiko1	cool fernando, thanks!
 n4nd0	heiko1: :)
 n4nd0	btw, I read the project idea you mentioned before
 n4nd0	it sounds very nice
 heiko1	yeah, I think it would be great to have
 n4nd0	are you planning to write down the idea with a couple of references maybe?
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	In fact, I am writing a paper about that
 n4nd0	very cool
 heiko1	could attract many people .)
 n4nd0	students to do that project or users once it is done?
 n4nd0	both maybe hehe
 heiko1	I had the latter in mind, no idea whether its attractive to students
 heiko1	I mean the word "statistic" itself is not the most attractive one :)
 n4nd0	haha maybe not
 heiko1	But if we had that everyone who would like to compute Gaussian likelihoods (or in general likelihoods with a log-determinant in them) of a large model could use shogun
 n4nd0	which sounds nice
 heiko1	I know of not many people who can do this
 heiko1	so statisticians can do their MCMC
 heiko1	ML people can do maximum likelihood methods
 heiko1	etc etc
 n4nd0	I see
 heiko1	I am currently trying to do inference on a worldwide-grid of ozone data
 heiko1	200000 observations
 n4nd0	what is the application?
 heiko1	and it works!
 heiko1	estimate posterior distributions of a spatial  linear gaussian model, say for whether reports
 n4nd0	aham
 heiko1	this involves computing the determinant of this sparse 200000x200000 matrix. Matlab or R cannot do this, but then shogun could
 heiko1	would also be nice to have a proper implementation for the paper
 heiko1	btw will you participate this year?
 heiko1	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun/src$ make unit-tests
 heiko1	echo yes
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	make -C ../tests/unit
 heiko1	make[1]: Entering directory `/home/heiko/Desktop/shogun/shogun/tests/unit'
 heiko1	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../../gmock-1.6.0/src/gmock-all.cc', needed by `gmock-all.o'. Stop.
 heiko1	any ideas here?
 n4nd0	I will send a couple of proposals for sure :)
 heiko1	nice :)
 n4nd0	heiko1: try to cd to tests/unit and run make there
 heiko1	yes, same
 heiko1	do I need to do make install before?
 n4nd0	so
 n4nd0	try to configure first and see if the script detects gtest and gmock on your system
 n4nd0	the default directories are
 heiko1	yes it does
 heiko1	gtest from ubuntu paclkage
 heiko1	maybe I will add the sources manually too
 n4nd0	gmock is found too?

 n4nd0	re
 n4nd0	I meant these two lines in ./configure trace
 n4nd0	Checking for Google C++ Testing Framework ... yes
 n4nd0	Checking for Google C++ Mocking Framework ... yes
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	both
 n4nd0	ok
 heiko1	I just removed them from ubuntu and configured with manual sources, lets see if that works
 n4nd0	ok
 heiko1	do you already have some project in mind for gsoc? like some extension of the old stuff?
 n4nd0	to continue doing SO stuff would be cool
 n4nd0	but I am interested in new stuff
 n4nd0	also*
 n4nd0	so I don't know
 n4nd0	brb
 heiko1	got the tests working
 heiko1	they fail :)
 heiko1	(but at least compile and run)
 n4nd0	back
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 n4nd0	were do they fail?
 n4nd0	I got them OK, with some warnings though
 heiko1	it might be the trace-mallocs
 heiko1	since they also leak memory
 heiko1	will investigate tomorrow, time to sleep!
 heiko1	good night!
 n4nd0	night

 n4nd0	is it something similar to gtest?

 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	a new concept, you are teaching me every day :)
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	what is new for you?

@sonney2k	blackburn, so what does gcov say / how do we use it?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't manage to try yet
 blackburn	will do step-by-step
 blackburn	I managed to create .gcno files but didn't try to profile it yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmh
@sonney2k	never tried so clueless...
 blackburn	sonney2k: step by step :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw I managed to get the submission form on to be on the sgto site; http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/registration
@sonney2k	n4nd0, any news about making the hierarchy work?
 blackburn	sonney2k: doesn't fit in my browser
 blackburn	by width
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the form looks nice embedded
@sonney2k	blackburn, can we change the generated form somehow?
 n4nd0	no, I have not looked into that
 blackburn	sonney2k: change like?
@sonney2k	blackburn, make it less wide
 blackburn	I am not sure about that
@sonney2k	no useless background
@sonney2k	image
@sonney2k	etc
 blackburn	ah sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: better?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes now we need to shorten or linebreak this thing "Do you want to give a talk about your research that involved Shogun? Please place your abstract here it if you do or even provide a link a possibly published paper that uses shogun."
 blackburn	sonney2k: tried - fail
 blackburn	sonney2k: here comes DA MASTER
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	now fits
