 sonne|work	besser82: man you are offensive today ;)
@besser82	sonne|work, am I?  ;(
 sonne|work	besser82: you know not so grumpy but a biiiig smiiile :P
@besser82	sonne|work, I really didn't want to hurt his feelings...  :P
@besser82	sonne|work, you can ask lupinix, I'm always like da :DDDDDD
 sonne|work	lupinix: you are besser82's attorney?
@lambday	sonne|work: hey
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@lambday	sonne|work: I want to change the get_column_vector method in SGMatrix to return SGVector<T> instead of T* sharing the same refcount as the SGMatrix
@lambday	sonne|work: is that okay?
 shogun-buildbot	build #524 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/524  blamelist: sanuj <sanuj.sharma.in@gmail.com>, Soumyajit De <heavensdevil6909@gmail.com>
 sonne|work	lambday: errm will that work if you don't get column 0 ?
 lupinix	sonne|work: maybe his guard :D
@lambday	sonne|work: umm.. didn't get it.. why won't we get column 0? if matrix is empty we can return an empty SGVector
 sonne|work	lupinix: better make sure to not being seen with besser82's grumpy face next to you ;)
 sonne|work	lambday: I mean get_column(1)
 sonne|work	lambday: what happens if we return that?
 sonne|work	lambday: I thought the pointer will point to the middle of the SGMatrix
@lambday	sonne|work: yeah.. it will work the same as of now - just an SGVector wrapper will share the refcount with the original matrix
 sonne|work	lambday: so it might destroy the wrong thing if the SGMatrix did get unref'd
 lupinix	:D so besser82 has to tell me which Fedora events he will join... so i have to choose the other ones :P
 sonne|work	lupinix: that's pretty anxious for a body guard
 sonne|work	lupinix: maybe bring him a mask or so
 lupinix	:D
@lambday	sonne|work: umm if the SGVector column shares the same refcount object with the original SGMatrix then it won't destroy the thing, right? because the original SGMatrix will still be having nnz refcount
@lambday	sonne|work: but presently since it returns T*, one can call delete [] on that and its gone!
 sonne|work	lambday: what about the following
 sonne|work	SGMatrix a;
 sonne|work	return a.get_column_vector(1);
 lupinix	sonne|work: but to be honest, besser82 is the guilty guy triggered me to play around with ML :D now my master thesis is ML related :D
 sonne|work	lupinix: it is always good to have someone one can blame
@lambday	sonne|work: we can return empty SGVector in that case
@lambday	sonne|work: which I think is better that the present one which returns &matrix[c*num_rows];
 sonne|work	lambday: I don't have an issue with empty vectors just that I am afraid that the delete is being called on the SGVector
 sonne|work	and that would then result in mmeory corruptions
@besser82	sonne|work, lupinix: You just need to bring in some cute girls to the events and my grumpy face with varnish  :P
 lupinix	:D
 sonne|work	lupinix: that or chocolate, beer, pizza will do!
@lambday	sonne|work: hmm.. yeah understood our concern.. I'll try something with this - test it locally then - I think it should be fine
@besser82	sonne|work, lupinix: food won't always do the trick =)
@besser82	sonne|work, lupinix: but there are two girls, which will always do the trick  :P
@besser82	sonne|work knows both of them ^^
 lupinix	:D
 sonne|work	lambday: if you can somehow make sure that SGVector calls free_data on the matrix then this would work
 lupinix	besser82: as a nerd this variant should be enough :P http://www.bash.org/?10171
@besser82	lupinix, lolz!  XD
@lambday	sonne|work: okay so in when someone does a get_column we can increase the refcount in SGMatrix and share the same refcount object with the column vector to be returned.. then it won't call free data, just decrase the refcount in the desctructor
@lambday	lupinix: man that was hilarious :D
 lupinix	:D
 sonne|work	lambday: then we have a memory leak since the matrix object can already be gone and only the column vector is still around
@lambday	sonne|work: ah I see
 sonne|work	lambday: you would need some SGVector thing that internally has a different pointer to be freed
@lambday	sonne|work: yeah but then it becomes ugly :(

 sonne|work	lambday: well the only other option is to return an SGVector with disabled ref-counting but then you still have the risks!
@lambday	sonne|work: yeah that's not any better than what we have currently
@lambday	sonne|work: guess we have to keep another pointer just for the case that the SGVector is a column of SGMatrix - finding least ugly way is the challenge :(
 sonne|work	lambday: well SGVector is virtual so you could just overload its free_data function and store the matrix ptr in some extra class
 sonne|work	lambday: maybe SGVectorFromMatrix or so
@lisitsyn	SGMatrixFromVectorFromMatrix ;)
@lambday	sonne|work: SGColumnVector would be a better name :D
@lambday	sonne|work lisitsyn btw just curious - why don't we inherit from SGReferencedData instead of CObject for everything?
@lambday	is there some cases where we don't want auto refcounting?
@lisitsyn	lambday: CObject has quite a lot
@lisitsyn	like parameters etc
@lisitsyn	CObject is refcounted as well
@lambday	lisitsyn: but that needs to be taken care of manually, right? SG_REF/SG_UNREF
@lambday	lisitsyn: we should make C++11 requirement mandatory and make everything Some<T> :D
@lisitsyn	hmm actually we can use shared_ptr even without C++11
@lambday	lisitsyn: boost? :P
@lisitsyn	lambday: our own shared_ptr :D
@lisitsyn	ain't it super easy
@lambday	lisitsyn: I was afraid that you'd say that :D
-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@122.168.84.42] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@lisitsyn	shared_ptr is the same thing that does SG_REF SG_UNREF in ctor/dtor
@lisitsyn	but thread safe
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah - RAII
@lambday	our refcount thing is thread safe as well - maybe we can reuse some stuffs there and write our own shared_ptr
@lambday	but the point is, why not reuse that's already there in standard
@lisitsyn	I'd go for c++11 if possible
@lambday	IMO if someone still uses some compiler that doesn't support c++11 he should be punished
@lambday	severely
@lisitsyn	haha yeah
@lambday	lisitsyn: BTW I'm afraid that ViennaCL matrixbase has changed in their new version - so I'll have to take care of it in GPUMatrix class that we have (https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/GPUMatrix.h#L81)
@lambday	I tried compiling with the new version of viennacl (1.6 I guess) - it failed

 curiousguy13	hey, after i installed shogun using -DPythonModular=ON , do i also have to manually edit the $PYTHONPATH or something because python is not detecting modshogun library
@besser82	curiousguy13, depends on with which prefix you installed shogun...
@besser82	curiousguy13, and the os you are using...
 curiousguy13	besser82, i did ' cmake -DPythonModular=ON ./ '  , then 'make -j5 all' and then 'make install' and my os is fedora 21
@besser82	curiousguy13, hehe...  you could have that easier  ;)
@besser82	curiousguy13, yum install python-shogun  ^^
 lupinix	i prefer python3-shogun besser82 :P
@besser82	lupinix, hehe  :P
 curiousguy13	besser82, ohh.. i didn't know that
@besser82	curiousguy13, I'm the package-maintainer on Fedora  :D
 curiousguy13	but i wanted to make it from the source
 lupinix	curiousguy13: besser82 is our hero
 lupinix	why from source?
 curiousguy13	nice :)
@besser82	curiousguy13, shogun 4.0.0 is currently prepared for build on F21+
@besser82	curiousguy13, yes, why from source?
 curiousguy13	because i want to contribute to shogun :D
@besser82	curiousguy13, then you usually want to build from source and then keep your build in some private prefix ^^
@besser82	curiousguy13, and not somewhere in /usr/local
@besser82	curiousguy13, so you would do sth. like:
@besser82	mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake -DPythonModular=ON .. && make -j5
@besser82	^^ that on is rubbish...  :(
@besser82	mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/shogun -DPythonModular=ON .. && make -j5
@besser82	make install
 curiousguy13	and after that python is gonna automatically detect modshogun?
 curiousguy13	(because i think i tried that too, let me try it again)
@besser82	curiousguy13, nope...  export PYTHONPATH="/opt/shogun/lib/python..."
@besser82	where "..." is the rest of the path the python-module went into...
@besser82	curiousguy13, for everyday use, I'd recommend using the distro-packages...
 curiousguy13	besser82, ^ i think that would solve it
 curiousguy13	besser82, yeah,i'll remember that :)
@besser82	curiousguy13, and to get all build-requires for sg-development:  yum-builddep shogun  ;)

 lupinix	besser82: btw you've said that there will be builds for F21+, what about F20 and epel7? any problems?
@besser82	lupinix, F20 is somewhat old...  I possibly may backport...
@besser82	lupinix, epel7 still needs some tweaking in the spec-file;  that build will follow soon :D
 lupinix	:D
 lupinix	nice
@besser82	lupinix, what about co-maintaining?  :P
 lupinix	why not, but after 20th feb

@besser82	hehehe ^_^
@besser82	lupinix, just request admin  =)
@besser82	lupinix, APPROVED!  ^^
 lupinix	yeah, pkgdb just sent spam
 lupinix	50 mails :D
@besser82	me, too  :P
@besser82	curiousguy13, you are familiar with packaging rpms?
 curiousguy13	besser82, i don't know how to package rpms , if that's what you're asking...
@besser82	curiousguy13, yes, that was my question ^^
 curiousguy13	besser82, ok, can you tell me about them?
@besser82	curiousguy13, sure!  I'm a packager-sponsor in Fedora-universe ^^
@besser82	curiousguy13, so packaging rpms starts with a spec-file
@besser82	that file contains some meta-data, like name of package, version, Summary, Description
@besser82	and some (mandatory) sections like %prep(are), %build, %install
@besser82	those sections are basically bash-scripts
@besser82	with some rpm-macros available
@besser82	like %configure or %make_install
 curiousguy13	ok, so rpm packaging requires mainly bash scripting and not any particular programming language, right?
@besser82	yes
@besser82	basically it is bash-scripting and knowledge about sed / grep
@besser82	and some packaging-rules "Fedora Guidelines" on top
* lupinix started with https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package some time ago
@besser82	which are more like a don't do this / avoid that / that way is godd pratice
 curiousguy13	besser82, hmm... doesn't seem too difficult then
@besser82	curiousguy13, not really... skills are comming with practice.
@besser82	curiousguy13, there are easy to package things and stuff that needs expirience
@besser82	curiousguy13, that one is a good example for easy stuff:  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/arprec.git/tree/arprec.spec
 lupinix	besser82: there are easier ones :P
@besser82	lupinix, you are right  :D
@besser82	curiousguy13, that one is really pice of cake:  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/2048-cli.git/tree/2048-cli.spec
 lupinix	but in general: everyone who can do a configure/make/make install in terminal (or cmake etc.) is able to build rpm packages
 lupinix	(as long it is not a groner *SCNR*)
@besser82	lupinix, everyone, but RaphGro  :P
 lupinix	:D
@besser82	lupinix, how show the shogun.spec to curiousguy13?  That might scare him away...  ;P
 lupinix	:D
@besser82	curiousguy13, and shogun is not that easy...  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/shogun.git/tree/shogun.spec
 curiousguy13	besser82, show me , i won't be scared
@besser82	curiousguy13, link is above ^^
 curiousguy13	besser82, i can understand most of it but whoever wrote it did an awesome job.
@besser82	curiousguy13, thanks ^^  It was me =)
