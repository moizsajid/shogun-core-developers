@iglesiasg	wiking, sup
@wiking	iglesiasg: about one of the
@wiking	gsoc ideas
@wiking	iglesiasg: i've added random forest under Fundamental machine learning algorithms
@wiking	new2shogun: i'm just trying to figure out which commit caused this bug
@wiking	new2shogun: ok i know what's the problem or at least i think i know
@wiking	somebody was messing with some cmake otions
@wiking	*options
@wiking	besser82: OSX_LIBSTDCXX
@wiking	besser82: why would u do that. why wouldn't u let cmake bail to libstdc++ by default of it's DARWIN?
@wiking	more importantly if u end up doing such a change then why wouldn't u document it somewhere?
@wiking	as currently as it is nobody would know to use that flag with current osx... and as well if u know that what's actually hte problem (swig not being able to support libc++ why would u let the decision this to the user instead of the configure... that's what's configure for for the first place
@wiking	new2shogun: i've got the solution for your problem
@wiking	soon a patch will come in
 new2shogun	wiking: that's great! thank you so much for looking into this!
@wiking	nw
@iglesiasg	wiking, good good about random forests
@iglesiasg	and awesome that you found out what is wrong with os x
@wiking	iglesiasg: any insights on my last email ...?
@wiking	as the whole list seems to be very quite about this topic...
@iglesiasg	wiking, I saw it was long so didn't read it right away :P
@iglesiasg	I will right it now and tell you
@iglesiasg	wiking, sorry man, didn't see you were asking for feedback about it in the mail too :(
@wiking	nw
@wiking	thnx

 thoralf	Hey.

 thoralf	wiking: About the license changing: Good that you take care of it and thanks for all the reminders.
* thoralf simply does not care which "free" (whatever definition) license we're chosing.

 thoralf	But if it helps, I'll give a +1 so we can focus on the important things.
 thoralf	If you're not "selling" code, but instead are trying to get better funding for Shogun, I think nobody will complain. :)
