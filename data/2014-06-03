 parijat	iglesiasg: hi!
 parijat	iglesiasg: I just saw your comments. About using real_max
 parijat	iglesiasg: actually CHAID handles MISSING value as just another attribute value
 parijat	iglesiasg: so implementation-wise using MISSING as a valid float value gives me a lot of advantage
@iglesiasg	parijat, ok
 parijat	iglesiasg: for example if you see merge method for ordinal attributes, there is nothing special done for missing attribute
@iglesiasg	parijat, I trust your criteria :)
 parijat	iglesiasg: :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, maybe I missed it, but did you mention in the doc that the user should use real_max to denote missing values?
 parijat	iglesiasg: nope not at the brief part! I should do it probably. I have mentioned it in the declaration place
 parijat	iglesiasg: This CHAID PR really got big without me realizing beforehand!

@iglesiasg	all right
@iglesiasg	gtg now, see you later guys!
 parijat	iglesiasg: bbye!

@iglesiasg	parijat, let me know in the PR if you plan to update something or I should just merge

 lambday	HeikoS: hey! do you have a min?
@HeikoS	lambday:  hello!
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things going?
 lambday	HeikoS: hey
 lambday	HeikoS: good actually
@HeikoS	nice, good to hear!
 lambday	HeikoS: so I made a quick python implementation to check results against
 lambday	and things are sane
 lambday	HeikoS: with this new design, adding b-test would just take 15 mins
@HeikoS	lambday: cool! very nice to hear that
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah quick python implementation is they way to test against
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah mentioned the link in commit msg
@HeikoS	lambday: and then put this into a notebook gist, send us for validation, and then put the link into unit test or so
 lambday	HeikoS: alright..
@HeikoS	lambday: looking very forward to play with this stuff btw!
 lambday	HeikoS: I'm just checking how many integration tests I broke btw :D
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah! here is the python code btw - https://github.com/lambday/shogun-hypothesis-testing/blob/master/btest.py
 lambday	HeikoS: you and Dino please check this once you get some free time... if this one is at least okay
 lambday	HeikoS: then its easier to verify shogun code
 lambday	made some changes later for generating unit-tests values :/
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah the unit tests are important. integration tests not so much for this one
@HeikoS	lambday: but if you break them, make surre to look at the errors before re-generatiung
@HeikoS	lambday: you know there is linspace in numpy? :)
 lambday	HeikoS: oh they have it already!
 lambday	argh I wrote creepy lambda stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: code looks fine btw, gotta check the things in detail but good on first look
 lambday	HeikoS: okay.. let me know if its okay later when you get some free time
 lambday	HeikoS: meanwhile I'm fixing broken ingration tests and then will send PR
@HeikoS	lambday: I am free now, what else is up?
 lambday	HeikoS: alright so I pushed the code to my fork already
 lambday	HeikoS: https://github.com/lambday/shogun/compare/feature;btest
 lambday	the unit-tests agrees with the results from the python code
 lambday	so, for other dependent stuffs, I used local machine values for unit-tests
 lambday	specially kernel selection unit-tests
@HeikoS	lambday: okay
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I mean the unit tests so far were written this way
@HeikoS	lambday: I just did stuff on my machine locally (from my MSc thesis code) and then put the numbers is, which is pretty bad
@HeikoS	so it cant be worse ;)
 lambday	HeikoS: haha :D having a reference implementation is best.. I don't have any for kernel selection stuffs..
 lambday	HeikoS: but I guess as long as basic statistic/var computation is verified with external code, other dependent stuffs follow from it - so it sort of works as before
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: so the kernel selection stuff worked fine
@HeikoS	lambday: its very easy after all
 thoralf	Heyhey.
@HeikoS	lambday: only the kernel combinations might be changed since they need all of the h-terms and their covariance
@HeikoS	lambday: btw feel free to you your new awespome linalg backend for all spectral things :)
@HeikoS	thoralf: hey!
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - well, the covariance stuff is changed a bit in compute_statistic_and_Q .. basically what I did is to stream 2 blocks from both the distributions and computed online cov... no h-vectors are there anymore since statistic directly computes a scalar value blockwise in the new formula
 lambday	HeikoS: with the new implementation, the weights for in the kernel selection are *pretty* close to what it was before
 lambday	linalg - yeah! as soon as it makes it to develop :)

@HeikoS	lambday: cool, that is good, they cannot be the same, but close is fine
@HeikoS	lambday: more important that the statistic/variance is correct and the kernel selection procedure should do the rest, btw feel free to review this code a bit and point out weaknesses
@HeikoS	lambday: did besser82 or wiking ever got back to you on the merge of linalg?
 lambday	HeikoS: umm.. bo
 lambday	no*
 lambday	HeikoS: btw khalednasr had some great ideas regarding using a wrapper class for viennacl matrices
 lambday	HeikoS: that was one big issue with the existing thing (remember why you asked to add at least a few more methods) :D
 lambday	but that's solvable using his ideas

@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I saw his suggestions. +1 from my side
@HeikoS	lambday: I dont know where everyone is, but we should aim to merge this stuff soon.
@HeikoS	lambday: what about some cholesky and triangular solvers?
 lambday	HeikoS: well, before that I think this viennacl matrix wrapper stuff should be finished
 lambday	so we'd get a clear idea whether we can use their matrices as well - since they too have many solvers
 lambday	if khaled's idea turns out to be great, then rest can be added more easily
@HeikoS	lambday: I see, cool!
 lambday	HeikoS: man I've been experimenting with p-values with old and new...
 lambday	HeikoS: is it normal for linear time mmd to give higher type 1 errors?
 lambday	even in the previous implementation its pretty high
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@host80-223-dynamic.246-95-r.retail.telecomitalia.it] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: type1?
@HeikoS	lambday: that depends on the quality of the asymptotic approximations to the null
@HeikoS	how many samples?
@HeikoS	you can always check that via sampling the null
@HeikoS	and look at the histogram
@HeikoS	if it looks very Gaussian, the type1 error should be exactly as desired
 lambday	HeikoS: I was working with existing examples only... tried 1000,10000,100000 samples with 0.5 mean shift
 lambday	yeah plot is better.. trying that
@HeikoS	lambday: if the plot is good but the type1 is wrong, then there is a bug
 lambday	HeikoS: what ideally should be the correct type1 error?
 lambday	HeikoS: plot is pretty gaussian
 lambday	with mean around 0
@HeikoS	type1 error is asymptotically euqal to p-value
 lambday	HeikoS: I guess then it makes sense - I also tried changing the blocksize and as Dino mentioned in the writeup, this approach gives correct variance estimate when blocksize is small but overestimates when blocksize is large
 lambday	made some plots
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	lambday: put them into a notebook, we can re-use this later
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
 lambday	HeikoS: data is going to change for integration tests - I'm first checking whether the changes make sense... then sending pr
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, this is fine, just monitor whether things are like totally different
@HeikoS	but on the other hand if everything is probably unit tested then we should be fine
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah its all unit-tested...
