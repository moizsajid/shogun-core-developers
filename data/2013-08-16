 sonne|work	wiking: some other topic - could you upload the video recordings?
@wiking	sonne|work: indeed
@wiking	sonne|work: btw: i think there's something wrong with ref counting: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/435/steps/compile/logs/stdio
@wiking	i mean with the new patches...
@wiking	sonne|work: and could you just comment on this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1430
@wiking	go/no-go?
 sonne|work	wiking: sure SG_MALLOC and friends are supposed to be used everywhere. maybe we should have some simple shell script test grepping for malloc / calloc / free on the buildbot to ensure that this doesn't happen?
@wiking	sonne|work: yes that's a good idea

 lisitsyn	shit happens!
@wiking	why?
@wiking	ah doc
@wiking	sonne|work: should we generate all the modular interfaces with nightly-default? thus we have all the modular interfaces as well in the generated package?
 sonne|work	nightly default shoudl include all interfaces
 sonne|work	it used to be what ./configure would do
@wiking	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	so detect all interfaces that are available and make sure that stuff works as is
@wiking	fixing
 sonne|work	nightly_all adds all possible flags with TRUE
 sonne|work	(as you can see in the config)
@wiking	sonne|work: currently interfaces are only built when asked for...
 sonne|work	and nightly_none disables all (e.g. no eigen no lapack etc) and checks for such build failures

@wiking	fuck this did not help :(
 sonne|work	wiking: but can you in the meantime upload the videos?
@wiking	i'm trying
@wiking	i wonder why fileno is not declared.... it's in stdio
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess they miss some include?
@wiking	sonne|work: but it's in that header file :)
 sonne|work	wiking: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-10/msg00131.html
@wiking	stdlib stdio are both included
 sonne|work	fileno is  *not* a ANSI functions
 sonne|work	function
 lisitsyn	hushell: have you looked through http://ai.stanford.edu/~bangpeng/document/iccv11_0981.pdf ?
 lisitsyn	just out of curiosity :)
@wiking	sonne|work: but we dont have -ansi
 sonne|work	wiking: we have c++11 which is
@wiking	sonne|work: does that imply -ansi by default?
 sonne|work	wiking: looks like. I had other errors in shogun due to c++11 exactly like that
@wiking	sonne|work: should we disable c++11 for cygwin? :D
@wiking	sonne|work: Google Test is designed to conform to the POSIX standard on UNIX-like
@wiking	> systems. It it will likely not work when pure ANSI conformance is expected.
@wiking	> I suggest compiling it without the -ansi option
 lisitsyn	haha I never expected such troubles
 lisitsyn	crazy
@wiking	i guess no c++11 then for cygwin

@wiking	kthnx

 thoralf	Hey guys
 thoralf	(and mates? ;))
 hushell	wiking: Ubuntu 11.04
@wiking	hushell: mmm okey
@wiking	hushell: -- Looking for clapack_dpotrf in /usr/lib/liblapack.so - not found
@wiking	ok no i see
@wiking	i'll try to fix it asap
 hushell	wiking: hmm, I found it :)
@wiking	hushell: do you have something like libcblas* under /usr/ ?
 hushell	wiking: liblapack.so is there and I am sure I apt-geted it before
@wiking	i suppose /usr/lib or somewhere
@wiking	hushell: find /usr -name 'libcblas*'
 hushell	wiking: no, I haven't installed the ATLAS stuffs, but interestingly I found /usr/include/cblas.h
@wiking	hushell: yep but you would need libcblas as well
@wiking	do you have it anywhere under /usr?
@wiking	or no
 hushell	wiking: sorry, I am using Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) 64-bit
 hushell	wiking: no I didn't find it
 hushell	let me try to install it
@wiking	nono
@wiking	dont need to install it
@wiking	i was just wondering
@wiking	if it's there and cmake doesn't detect it
@wiking	or it's really not there
@wiking	but if find /usr -name 'libcblas*'
@wiking	did not give you anything
@wiking	then cmake is right
@wiking	and there's a little bug among the examples
@wiking	i've already fixed it

@wiking	hushell: yes but anyways evaluation_cross_validation_regression uses KernelRidgeRegression that need LAPACK
@wiking	so that needed to fixed anyways
 hushell	wiking: okay, now I have libcblas.so, let me try again
@wiking	hushell: nonononoooooo
@wiking	hushell: it will work now
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	i mean it's not a problem for u
@wiking	but a problem for me :P
 hushell	wiking: :D
 sonne|work	wiking: maybe we disable gtest for cygwin then. we need c++11 there too for the atomic int
@wiking	sonne|work: it now works...
@wiking	sonne|work: but of course w/o c++11

@wiking	sonne|work: that's hy the unit test fails
 sonne|work	wiking: err IDK
@wiking	sonne|work: ok i'll check now on a droplet
@wiking	hushell: so you used 12.04
@wiking	digital ocean i love you :P
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so if we want c++11 on cygwin then we won't have unit testing on cygwin

@wiking	sonne|work: i mean of course the other possibility is that cygwin does have c++11 if u dont want to run the unit tests
 hushell	wiking: yep, I forgot I installed a new version on this laptop
@wiking	sonne|work: if u run the unit tests then c++11 will be disabled on cygwin
@wiking	hushell: that's ok i just want to reproduce this
 hushell	wiking: after installing libatlas-base-dev, everything is fine
@wiking	hushell: yeah i know :P
 hushell	but why the old configure version doesn't have this problem
@wiking	hushell: yeah that's what i'm trying to find out now
 hushell	wiking: we don't have "make tests" now?
 sonne|work	wiking: or the other way round - if c++11 is enabled unit tests will be disabled
 sonne|work	wiking: in any case I would just turn the unit tests of on cygwin and just run the libshogun examples

 thoralf	While parallel training of a few thousand SVMs the virtual memory size grows up to 80GB (not swap usage), while resident size stays at 18GB.
 thoralf	Any explanations for that?
 thoralf	Not quite a shogun question, but it somehow scares me. ;)
-!- foulwall [~user@2001:da8:215:6901:d88:6c45:2f56:4f96] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	thoralf: what kind of svms? kernel svms?
 thoralf	sonne|work: No, only liblinear.
 thoralf	sonne|work: But about 7000.
 sonne|work	thoralf: feeding data from memory mapped files?
 thoralf	(Running 16 in parallel using threads)
 thoralf	sonne|work: No.
 sonne|work	copying data?
 sonne|work	I can tell it cannot happen!
 sonne|work	with shogun virtual == resident memory most of the time
 sonne|work	except if you use big caches somewhere that are only half used
 thoralf	sonne|work: No, only reading a sparse matrix it once into memory and then only creating sparse-feature-files with the same matrix.
 thoralf	sonne|work: No explicit caching.  The only thing I keep after every training run is a weight vector.
 sonne|work	it must be some big memory blocks you allocate
 thoralf	sonne|work: resident size is no problem, though.
 sonne|work	thoralf: have a look at /proc/<PID>/smaps if you see sth massive in there
 thoralf	No explicit allocations on my side except this big matrix.  Maybe I'm doing it implictly and using liblinear - constantly allocating and deallocating big chunks.
 sonne|work	thoralf: only other option is to run with trace-mallocs and check
 sonne|work	thoralf: no liblinear doesn't need extra memory
 thoralf	sonne|work: No leaks. ;)
 sonne|work	`just' your big matrix
 sonne|work	thoralf: sure no leaks but you could display the currently allocated stuff
 thoralf	I'll check.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Okay, smaps seems to help.  "Size:" sums up to the virtual memory size I got from top.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Growing count of 65MB blocks.

 thoralf	sonne|work: My first observation: memory allocations are slowing down by factor 60-100.
 thoralf	sonne|work: My second: My usage of threads are problem.
 thoralf	sonne|work: training 16 svms in parallel *and* each svm doing dot-products-range in parallel (sg_parallel->get_num_threads()) gives 256 threads.
 thoralf	sonne|work: I don't know how big the per-thread-allocations are, but setting sg_parallel->num_threads = 1 gives me low and constant vmsize.
 sonne|work	thoralf: ah you mean apply()
 thoralf	sonne|work: No, train.
 sonne|work	thoralf: indeed that eats some threads but not memory
 sonne|work	thoralf: liblinear doesn't use parallel at all
 thoralf	sonne|work: Oh, yes!  Cross validation does apply() all the time.
 thoralf	Yes.
 sonne|work	how many examples / dims btw?
 thoralf	1M training examples, 2M dimensions
 thoralf	Very sparse.
 thoralf	But 7000 classes. ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: looks like sth went wrong with the documentation http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/installation.html
 sonne|work	thoralf: 7000 classes and multiclass liblinear or do you do 1 vs 1?
 thoralf	sonne|work: 1 vs 1
 sonne|work	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t15vP1PyoA nice!
 thoralf	Multilabel setting - overlapping classes.
 sonne|work	thoralf: that would explain it
@wiking	sonne|work: oh
 thoralf	sonne|work: Explain what exactly?
 sonne|work	thoralf: you would get ~7000^2 weight vectors for your 1vs1 ones and do that in parallel with x-val so times 16
 sonne|work	thoralf: your memory usage
 thoralf	sonne|work: Yes.
@wiking	sonne|work: where should we put patches for third party libs?
 thoralf	sonne|work: Sorry, not 7000^2.  Only 7000 weight vectors - 1vR
 sonne|work	wiking: hmmhh scary
 thoralf	sonne|work: Cool video.  Especially the landing part.
 sonne|work	thoralf: agreed
 sonne|work	wiking: can we get these patches integrated into third party? It is a bit scary having to taking care of patches for external sw :/
@wiking	sonne|work: mmm well tcmalloc just has been released... so i dont think that the patch will come any time soon

 lisitsyn	hey pickle27
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I wanted to clarify
 lisitsyn	what's the issue with ICA base class?
 lisitsyn	I mean I don't mind it for sure - what's that particular you are unsure with?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I'm not unsure about anything I just wanted to let you know i was planning to do that
 lisitsyn	ahhhh
 lisitsyn	got it then
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ok then :)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: theres like 4 classes that all have the same get_mixing_matrix function etc
 pickle27	so I think it makes sense
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah sure
 lisitsyn	pickle27: as for examples
 lisitsyn	I don't know
 lisitsyn	I'd rather add copy paste examples actually
 lisitsyn	at least this way all your algorithms are being run
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I mean they all have unit tests
 pickle27	but its super easy to make an example for each
 lisitsyn	yeah but these are for integration tests
 pickle27	ah okay
 lisitsyn	pickle27: it seems you made a good choice with not going to google :) it seems they have stopped that 20% rule
 pickle27	lisitsyn: oh really
 pickle27	that kind of sucks
 pickle27	my company has quarterly "hack days" where the whole office stops and works on side projects
 pickle27	its actually pretty common for new tech companies
 pickle27	they made this video
 pickle27	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v80UVaw-qmA
 lisitsyn	pickle27: some people say things like 'never work in a large company'
 pickle27	this is also true
 lisitsyn	yeah I tend to believe
 lisitsyn	the company I am working in right now is getting bigger now and I feel it is going worse
 lisitsyn	pickle27: shopify is quite small, right?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: umm they used to be they're growing a fair bit right now
 lisitsyn	leave it once it is >500 ;)
 pickle27	they're around 200 now
 lisitsyn	haha
 pickle27	I think a lot of web companies plateu around there
