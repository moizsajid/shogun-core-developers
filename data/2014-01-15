-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@213.87.143.76] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	besser82: well I realized that tests fail due to a bug in tester.py
 sonne|work	besser82: so that needs some fixing but I guess that is mostly it
 sonne|work	besser82: the other thing is that we use -stdlib=stdlibc++ in cmake
 sonne|work	besser82: which is not working fine under the latest osx
 sonne|work	besser82: since that is using libc++
 sonne|work	which is not compatible
 sonne|work	besser82: so we have a linker error
 sonne|work	when we compile libshogun with protobuf
 sonne|work	besser82: so my question is if we can easily drop the libstdc++ option from the top level CMakelists but just for libshogun not for the rest...

 besser82	sonne|work:  that Libstdc++ should be doable without much noise  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  what should be compiled with which stdc++?
 sonne|work	besser82: only the swig interface
 sonne|work	besser82: look in CMakeLists.txt in the top level dir
 sonne|work	there already are 2 lines like that
 besser82	sonne|work:  allrighty, will do ;)

 sonne|work	besser82: the other way round
 sonne|work	libc++ on osx for libshogun only
 besser82	sonne|work: it defaults to that
 besser82	sonne|work: if no one explicity specifies that option, if will default to libc++ on OSX
 besser82	sonne|work: or do you mean by logic way?
 sonne|work	 IF(OSX_LIBSTDCXX)
 sonne|work	 +    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-stdlib=libstdc++ ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")
 sonne|work	 +  ELSE
 sonne|work	+    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-stdlib=libc++ ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")
 sonne|work	besser82: so on linux -> libc++

 Saheb	does it help in learning machine learning algorithms?
@sonney2k	Saheb, sure and yes to both questions
 Saheb	how should i begin? are there any issues or bugs left?
@sonney2k	Saheb, the answer to this depends a bit on what your skills are / what you are interested in
 Saheb	I am a javascript developer and looking forwward to create some nice visualizations that make understanding machine learning algorithms easy
@iglesiasg	Saheb, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?labels=entrance&milestone=none&state=open for open issues
@iglesiasg	Saheb, you might want to have a look at the ones labelled with entrance
@sonney2k	Saheb, ok then I guess it is best you start with fetching shogun from source / copiling installing the python modular interface
@sonney2k	Saheb, then git clone the shogun-demos repository and get it to run
 Saheb	there are no build steps return or dependencies specified in shogun-demos, I did clone and tried to build it check the demos, it gave {smogun}  module not found! Not sure if the module name was exactly the same
 Saheb	and iglesiasg entrance bugs need some prior knowledge to ML or are just develoment related?
@iglesiasg	Saheb, they are more small development tasks than bug fixing
@iglesiasg	Saheb, and I couldn't tell about all of them -- I'd say most of them are ML-related but better have a look ;)
@sonney2k	Saheb, please install shogun too!
 Saheb	cool, I will do that and get back and hey guys linux is preffered right for development in shogun community right?
@iglesiasg	most of us are with some linux distro, a couple with os x
@iglesiasg	you can try in windows too, but it might be a hard task to get it running there
 Saheb	I am not fan of Windows..;) I would always love to work in Linux..:D
