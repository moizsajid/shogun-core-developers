@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hey!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I have seen that the urls for the md files accept e.g. README, README.md, but also pretty much any string after the point like README.aasdf
@iglesiasg	can that arise any issue?

 thoralf	Hey.
 thoralf	There are interferences between the unit tests.
 thoralf	these tests break if running the whole test suite: CSVFileTest.vector_int32, SerializationHDF5.Random, SerializationXML.Random
 thoralf	But not if you run them with --gtest_filter=CSVFileTest.*
 thoralf	--gtest_filter=SerializationXML.*
 thoralf	etc
 thoralf	unknown file: Failure
 thoralf	Unknown C++ exception thrown in the test body.

 thoralf	Heyho!
 thoralf	wiking?  I've got work for you. ;)
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@wiking	thoralf: oh i just saw
@wiking	replied
 thoralf	wiking: Sorry, 3.0.0 was not affected.
 thoralf	Don't know what I was doing in parallel when I wrote this. ;)
 thoralf	wiking: The last gdb instruction was "next" instead of "step".  "new" returned successfully.
 thoralf	As the gdb output shows.
 thoralf	Can this statement fail?
 thoralf	        ssize_t actual_read =
 thoralf	                read(fd, reinterpret_cast<char*>(&seed), sizeof(seed));
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	the assert should filter out problems
@wiking	        ASSERT(fd > 0);
 thoralf	Oh, the assertion failed.
 thoralf	It's so simple.
@wiking	lol
@wiking	assertion failed
@wiking	?
@wiking	which? :D
 thoralf	ASSERT(fd > 0);
 thoralf	errno 34, "Numerical result out of range"
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	do u actually have /dev/[u]random?
@wiking	i suppose so :P
@wiking	but that's the error
@wiking	for some reason fd <= 0
@wiking	which stands for 'error opening file'
 thoralf	crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 9 Nov 25 10:11 /dev/urandom
 thoralf	errno is 34
@wiking	hehehe
 thoralf	"Numerical result out of range"
@wiking	wtf? :)
 thoralf	It's only three tests - other tests are running well.
 thoralf	Isolated test execution works well, too.
 thoralf	Hmm.  Seems that open() does not set errno.
 thoralf	So 34 is wrong.
@wiking	#define ERANGE          34      /* Result too large (possibly too small) */
@wiking	yeah as that really doesn't make too much sense :P
@wiking	     If successful, open() returns a non-negative integer, termed a file
@wiking	     descriptor.  It returns -1 on failure, and sets errno to indicate the
@wiking	     error.
 thoralf	I'm just getting paranoid.
 thoralf	Maybe fd=0 is a valid descriptor?
 thoralf	You're checking for fd>0.
@wiking	0 is stdin
@wiking	so actually it should be
@wiking	fd >= 2
@wiking	or fd 1
@wiking	no fd > 2
@wiking	can u try maybe fd >= 0
 thoralf	I'm just recompiling. ;)
@wiking	since maaaaaybe somebody closes stdin/stdout/stderr
@wiking	and then u can get fd = 0
@wiking	but i can hardly believe that there's 0 fd open on the whole system :)
 thoralf	When errno is not set, then there was not error.  But fd>0 fails... so fd=0 might be okay.
@wiking	that's usually stdin
@wiking	so that would be reeeeallly strange that u get 0
 thoralf	HAHA.
 thoralf	Works well.
 thoralf	open(/dev/urandom) returned 0
@wiking	lol
 thoralf	The error seems trivial... but so many epic fails while debugging. ;)
 thoralf	But as the "man 2 open" tells that only -1 is an error, we should remember to always ASSERT(fd >= 0)
 thoralf	wiking: Could you fix it please?  It's not critical to me, so take your time... but I guess you did this assertion in many places?
 thoralf	wiking: Ah!  fopen returns a pointer, so fd==NULL is a valid check.  While open returns an integer, so 0 is valid as well.

 thoralf	Hey sonne|osx
 sonne|osx	thoralf: hey there
 thoralf	wiking: I checked all other uses of open(), but they all check for -1 or <0.  Only CRandom is wrong.
 sonne|osx	thoralf: so who is fixing it now?
 thoralf	sonne|osx: I just sent a PR.
