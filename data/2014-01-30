@wiking	Agreed that it would be nice to backport it. If there were more developers we could probably find the time for more releases, but help is in short supply. There is quite a reasonably big effort required in making a new release. I could do one, if there was some sponsorship available or more help about in getting version 3 ready. I do this all in my spare time. Very little should break in version 3. It has been developed with the same high degree of back
@wiking	^ we should get support for swig

 parijat	iglesiasg, hello!
@iglesiasg	parijat, hi
 parijat	iglesiasg, was kind of waiting for you! :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, haha ok, sorry
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am not spending that much time at IRC any longer during weekdays. It feels like I should not hang up around here at work :S
 parijat	iglesiasg, haha..
@iglesiasg	parijat, anyway, you can always reach me in the mailing list or by mail or so
 parijat	iglesiasg, ya definitely it wasnt extremely important so i didnt bother you
@iglesiasg	parijat, aright. Tell me then

@iglesiasg	parijat_, all right
@iglesiasg	parijat_, that is happening locally in your machine ,right?
 parijat_	iglesias, the new constructors which I added to C++ code are not added it seems
 parijat_	iglesias, nope in cloud
 parijat_	iglesias, didn't try locally
@iglesiasg	parijat_, aham, I see. Well that is probably because the installation used for this cloud environment is probably not up-to-date with develop branch
@iglesiasg	which makes sort of sense since develop is precisely not the most stable branch ever :)
@iglesiasg	wiking, ping
@iglesiasg	wiking, so what is the version of Shogun executed in the web ipython environment? ^
 parijat_	iglesias, alright thought so. but centers initialization by hand is added in the latest release of shogun i guess
@iglesiasg	parijat_, what does that mean?
@wiking	iglesiasg: mmm haven't updated it for a while as i was hoping that the trusted build of index.docker.io will kick in soon... but unfortunately that wasn't the case... it still does not work with repos that have submodules :<
@wiking	iglesiasg: it's 3.0 actually
@iglesiasg	wiking, all right! Then it makes sense what parijat_ experienced :)
@wiking	you mean that a notebook is missing that has been recently commited?
@wiking	:)
 parijat_	iglesias, alright makes sense to me.
 parijat_	wiking, yup
@wiking	sorry 'bout that but updating docker container of shogun wasn't on my prio list... moreover as mentioned above an automatic build system should have kicked in a while ago... :>
 parijat_	iglesias and wiking, thanks
@wiking	nw
@wiking	https://github.com/zoq/benchmarks
@wiking	ok so we can start patching it
 lisitsyn	haha I just read it as ZOG

@wiking	:>

 lisitsyn	wiking: kryo? ;)
 lisitsyn	wiking: somebody told me about it as a fast thing once
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah currently i'm struggling with kryo... but i might as well fix it
@wiking	haha this would be cool
@wiking	https://elastic.mesosphere.io/
@wiking	lisitsyn: see this is what we really miss
@wiking	lisitsyn: click click click -> shogun cluster
 lisitsyn	wiking: but they have all the stuff already
 lisitsyn	why to repeat it
@wiking	well no
@wiking	they do have the stuff
@wiking	we should just build over it
@wiking	not repeating it
@wiking	obviously i dont want to write a whole clustering fw
@wiking	within shogun
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: lol have u seen this: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
@wiking	ie 9.0% :)))
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah it is not a problem now
 lisitsyn	you just write for chrome
 lisitsyn	and check may be it works in firefox
@wiking	that escaleted quite fast :)
 lisitsyn	yeah gaps are quite big
 lisitsyn	like people are running scared
@wiking	6 years and it's down from 54%
@wiking	m$ had this one going quite easy
@wiking	they were busy building the next kinect i guess :)))
@wiking	lisitsyn: ok so what should be the reasoning bla bla bla here
@wiking	http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/license/
