@sonney2k	gsomix, haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey!
 n4nd0	blackburn: how is it going?
 blackburn	n4nd0: fine just get home from my first bike ride this year :)
 blackburn	and tested SLEP regression thing - yay it works
 n4nd0	awesome
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am really happy with new vim pluging pluskid suggested
 blackburn	that really gives impact on performance of development
 blackburn	plugins*
@sonney2k	http://fseoane.net/blog/2012/line-by-line-report-of-memory-usage/
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ seen this
@sonney2k	very useful to trace leaks IMHO
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes - it was in chris' g+
 blackburn	sonney2k: I consider libshogun examples more useful but yes can be useful too
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh I didn't see that about the plugins, what day in the logs?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm didn't you? it was thursday or wednesday I guess
 blackburn	namely clang_complete, powerline and fugitive are awesome
 n4nd0	blackburn: ah ok I read when you talked about them with sonney2k
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will need to handle multiple outputs regression somehow
 blackburn	another machine?
 blackburn	it will be linear though
* gsomix have returned.
 gsomix	I have played in volleyball, hehe.
 gsomix	sonney2k, moin. what about CArray patch?
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * ra108880 / src/interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i : fix csharp compile error - http://git.io/6PKb2A
@sonney2k	blackburn, no just other labels
@sonney2k	gsomix, how far is it?
@sonney2k	you said it is WIP in the pull request...
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha, I should add display methods and comments.
@sonney2k	ok I give you some feedback
@sonney2k	sec
 gsomix	sonney2k, thank you. :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, looks good to me - except maybe - didn't you also need to change dynamicobjectarray?
@sonney2k	I mean wasn't there one Array using an SGObject underneath?
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes indeed in DynProg: CArray2<CPlifBase*>
@sonney2k	so for that you will need to use DynamicObjectArray and add the functions you have to this one too
@sonney2k	I mean the ones you added to dynarray/dynamicarray
 blackburn	sonney2k: one issue about mp
 blackburn	I have no idea how to handle references count lock
 blackburn	hmm no forget - it is possible
 gsomix	sonney2k, okay. :)
 gsomix	flash memory in phone is broken :(
