 thoralf	Heyhey
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Good morning ,)
 abinash_panda	hey thoralf
 abinash_panda	its actually night over here ;)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: What are you currently working on?
 abinash_panda	Currently, I am working on the feature hashing. The gist you had sent me today was really helpful :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I have a few questions..
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Shoot.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: First, what should be class name of hashed features, I propose HashedSparseMultilabelFeatures. Any suggestions?
 thoralf	I think "Sparse" is not neccessary.
 thoralf	necessary
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay, so we can go with HashedMultilabelFeatures
 abinash_panda	thoralf: But, I would be supporting mainly hashed features, so I was thinking of adding *Sparse*. Okay, no problem
 thoralf	If you find this important, let's call it HashedSparse...
 abinash_panda	Okay, fine.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Second, the user should provide the seeds for hashing right?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Well, for the beginning, you can just say seed for the i-th label is "i" ;)
 abinash_panda	So, I am thinking the constructor would be something like CHashedSparseMultilabelFeatures<ST>(CSparseFeatures* feats, int32_t d, SGVector<uint32_t> seeds,...)
 thoralf	What's d?
 abinash_panda	d is the dimension of the new feature
 thoralf	Ah, of course.
 thoralf	Yes.
 abinash_panda	So, if the user doesn't provide the seeds we can go for seed of i-th label as "i"
 thoralf	Yes, that would be helpful.
 abinash_panda	so another constructor would be something like CHashedSparseMultilabelFeatures(feats, dim, num_classes, ...)
 thoralf	num_labels?
 thoralf	Let me check. ;)
 abinash_panda	okay
 thoralf	num_classes, you're right.
 thoralf	This is a bit confusing.
 abinash_panda	okay...num_classes means the total number of classes we are having...right?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yes.
 thoralf	And num_labels should be called num_examples to avoid confusion.
 thoralf	But it's too late now.
 thoralf	(It's never too late... but. ;)
 abinash_panda	yeah...I would try to modify it wherever I can
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I guess the implementation is straight forward.  Do you think you have to implement more that get_joint_feature_vector and get_dim?
 abinash_panda	get_joint_feature and get_dim are the methods of a StructuredModel, but I am implementing a DotFeature class.
 abinash_panda	I am thinking of having a class for hashed features and not modifying the MultilabelModel
 abinash_panda	Any suggestions?
 thoralf	I think it would be easier to don't implement own features, because the joint features is not a tensor any more.
 abinash_panda	Now, I am getting confused.
 abinash_panda	If you could explain me the hashing once again.
 abinash_panda	What I thought that we would be hashing the feature vector, so it would be better to implement our own features.
 thoralf	normal so learning optimizes < w ; PSI(x,y) > with PSI(x,y) = x (x) y where (x) denotes tensor product
 thoralf	hashing optimizes < w ; PSI(x,y) > with PSI(x,y) = sum_{i \in y} phi(x,i)
 thoralf	where phi is a hashing function parametrized by i
 thoralf	or sum_i [[y_i == 1]] * phi_i(x)
 thoralf	Same thing, different notation
 abinash_panda	Okay, now I get it.
 abinash_panda	Previously, I was thinking of something else.
 abinash_panda	so, now just PSI(x, y) changes meaning I have to change get_joint_feature_vector and get_dim
 abinash_panda	So, now the MultilabelModel should have a constructor something like this MultilabelModel(CFeatures* features, CStructuredLabels* labels, bool hashing = false, int32_t dim = 0)
 thoralf	I still would create a new Hashing(Sparse;))MultilabelModel
 thoralf	There is some duplication, but the functionality would be too different.
 abinash_panda	Yeah that would be better.
 thoralf	If we see too much duplicated behaviour, we can talk about it.
 thoralf	Ah, well.  You also have to implement a slightly different version of argmax.
 thoralf	Because the current one assumes that each class has it's own features.
 thoralf	The new one can just do < w, phi_(x) > to find out the score for label i
 abinash_panda	you mean <w, phi_i(x)> where phi_i(x) would be hashing function parameterized by i..right?
 thoralf	Yeah.
 abinash_panda	Okay. Got it.
 thoralf	This can be used to get the score of label i.
 thoralf	It still decomposes in a linear way, so we can put the sum into the scalar product or outside.
 thoralf	< w ; sum_{i \in y} phi(x,i) > = sum_{i \in y} < w ; phi(x,i) >
 abinash_panda	and if the score of label i > 0, then we should predict i
 thoralf	Exact.
 thoralf	As usual :)
 abinash_panda	Okay. So, I going to implement it now :)
 thoralf	Yeah, good luck.
 thoralf	You should start thinking about some small plot/example/ipython notebook.
 thoralf	Only gathering ideas what to evaluate/write/plot on which (toy?) data...
 abinash_panda	Yeah...I would do it. I was writing it earlier, and suddenly my computer got crashed :(
 abinash_panda	All of it got deleted, as I had to format it.
 abinash_panda	So, I would do it.
 abinash_panda	BTW, have you used the PrimalMosekSOSVM solver?

 kislay	hey lisitsyn :)
 lisitsyn	kislay: hey
 kislay	congo for the MSC man :D
 lisitsyn	kislay: thanks!
 lisitsyn	kislay: how is it going?
 kislay	Fine. I have tried to implement the macro thing you commented there.
 lisitsyn	kislay: cool, is it better now?
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	was able to cut lots of code.
 kislay	See the PR when you get free. I have to keep improving it.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: No, didn't use it so far.
 thoralf	Hey Master L
 kislay	Hey T!! how's you? :)
 thoralf	kislay: I'm fine. :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Actually, I have used it on my machine and found that it took a lot of time to train.
 thoralf	Very hot here and glad it's evening and got a bit colder :)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yeah, they all take some time.  I thing SGD was the fastest one.
 thoralf	think
 kislay	hah! we have 46 degrees here! in India!!
 abinash_panda	thoralf: The toy example provided in so_multiclass.cpp worked fine, but when I had increased the features and examples in hundreds of thousands, I had to reboot my computer.
 thoralf	kislay: degree celsius?
 kislay	yup yup
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Before starting the script, call "ulimit -v <kbytes>" to save your machine ;)
 kislay	thoralf, Thats actually normal summer temp. here.
 thoralf	Set it to something like 80% of your RAM.
 thoralf	kislay: That's crazy.  Who's responsible for this decision? ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay. I didn't know about. Thanks :)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Must be called in the same shell as used for running the command.
 thoralf	Has no affect on already running processes or other shells.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: yeah..it would use it
 kislay	thoralf, the equator crosses India... probably thats why!
