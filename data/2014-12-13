 mooore	hi all
 mooore	I'm trying to install shogun Matlab Interface on Ubuntu + Matlab R2014b
 mooore	This is the error I got: Error: Unknown MEX argument '-o'
 mooore	When I change "-o" to "-output" in cmake file, I got the error "Unknown file extension '.16'."

 morrrrrrreeeeeee	hi all
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	anybody alive?
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	is there an example for MKL Regression - Python Modular Interface?
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	there is mkl_regression.py for Python Static but inside the script it says "sg('train_classifier')"
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	is it for mkl regression or classification
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	layyyyyyyyyyyyynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	uyanin aq

@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, 2nd warning: stop screaming! ^^
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: are you a developer?
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, yes i am
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, but *NOT* mathlab-interface  :P
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: wow, glad to see a developer here
@besser82	hehe ^^ so what's the beef? :D
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: what about Python modular interface?
@besser82	mkl_regression.py is for regression
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: I'm looking for a MKL Regression example for Python Modular Interface
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	mkl_regression.py is for static interface
@besser82	there are lot in examples/undocumented/python_modular
@besser82	all named regression_*.py
@besser82	like regression_svrlight_modular.py
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: yes, there are. but there is no example for mkl regression, right?
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, afaik svrlight is mkl regression
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: no, it works with a single kernel
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, then have a look at this one:  mkl_multiclass_modular.py
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: mkl_multiclass_modular.py is for classification, I'm looking for a regression mkl example
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, regression works the sameway;  try to understand the pyStatic-example and adjust it to use the modular if...  ;)
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: honestly, you can help me about this? for a fair compensation?
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, let me see...  so you want to do MKL regression with python modular...
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: yes
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, let me see if I can find some simple code in my collection...
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: great
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, please drop me your email-address.  i'll sent you some simple py_mod-example during tomorrow or monday, aight?
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: alright, thx
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: mstfylcn (at) gmail .com
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, kk ^^
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: I built shogun now with python static interface but it didn't create sg.so
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: what could be the reason? do you have any idea?
@besser82	morrrrrrreeeeeee, not really... no clue... never build nor used the *_static-interfaces...
 morrrrrrreeeeeee	besser82: thx, looking forward to hearing from you soon, have a nice day
