@HeikoS	wiking: hi
@HeikoS	wiking: we fixed all warnings and cleaned up swig quite a bi
@HeikoS	t
@HeikoS	wiking: binary package has highest priority for release
@HeikoS	wiking: you mentioned some mac problems also?
-!- iglesiasg [~iglesias@50-197-153-181-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net] has joined #shogun
@wiking	HeikoS: some? :)
@wiking	lol there's a lot of problems
@wiking	actually i dont know how about u guys
@wiking	but if u start using swig3.x
@wiking	none of the modular interfaces work
@HeikoS	wiking: I know that
@HeikoS	wiking: but its fine for this release
@wiking	so that's a big problem as well
@HeikoS	this one is gsoc
@wiking	no it's not fine
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20modular_interfaces
@wiking	it's comppletely broken
@HeikoS	we need to release asap
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	since when?
@wiking	why do we need to release right away
@wiking	HeikoS: since forever
@HeikoS	wiking: to get gsoc momentum going
@wiking	well we have gsoc momentum going
@wiking	we are just fixing a tons of shit
@HeikoS	wiking: now is a good time, then we can feature freeze and do a bugfix release after
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/milestones/SHOGUN%203.2.1
@HeikoS	wiking: I know all that
@HeikoS	wiking: but a gsoc release would be good
@wiking	so yeah
@wiking	let's fix that
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	or at least 50% of that
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah I agree
@wiking	and yeah i'm working on the packing
@HeikoS	wiking: ok great
@wiking	but it's not like an easy shit
@wiking	we have a big problem with csv reader
@HeikoS	wiking: so once thats done, and all warnings are gone, and release texts etc are written, we can see how other things went in that time
@wiking	it has a hardcoded limitation about 16 megs
 iglesiasg	damn readers
@wiking	which is totally stupid
@HeikoS	wiking: csv reader is crap
@HeikoS	wiking: should be deleted
@wiking	no it's not crap
@wiking	it just needs a little love
@HeikoS	haha fernando is laughing
@HeikoS	wiking: I agree on that
@HeikoS	wiking: but I think this is not important for this release
@HeikoS	wiking: as we have tons of new things already
@wiking	how is it not important
@wiking	that u cannot use shogun for anything
@wiking	other than stupid toy datasets? :)
@wiking	i mean that fix is really minimal
@HeikoS	wiking: mmmh you got a point ;)
@HeikoS	ok good to know
@HeikoS	what are the most severe things in your eyes?
@wiking	well all the osx problems
@HeikoS	i vote for: binary package, all warnings green, osx build
@wiking	swig 3.x gets everything broken
@HeikoS	wiking: but swig 3.0 I dont know
@wiking	and those minor things like csv reader
@HeikoS	cant we do this later?
@wiking	HeikoS: should be any eays fix
@wiking	HeikoS: thing is that it's a segfault
@wiking	so it just needs gdb love
@HeikoS	wiking: ah ok
@wiking	i'll waste a day on it
@wiking	and see if that helps
@wiking	if not then of course postpone
@HeikoS	wiking: btw offtopic
@HeikoS	wiking: matlab is written in java
@HeikoS	wiking: and shogun supports java
@wiking	i'm just trying to fucking get this packages out
@wiking	HeikoS: isn't just the GUI written in java?
@HeikoS	wiking: so there might be a way
@HeikoS	wiking: no one can natively execute java code
@wiking	HeikoS: afaik it's only the gui that's java
@wiking	but if any of you have matlab installed
@wiking	u can check out the dependency of the file ;P
 iglesiasg	I do, can check
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, we talked a bit aobut this here, its not important for now
@wiking	but since matlab has non gui console shit
 iglesiasg	I know that when you run matlab on command line you can choose to do it w/o jvm
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	so i reckon matlab is none java
@wiking	only the gui is java
 iglesiasg	yep
 iglesiasg	anyway
@wiking	fuck matlab
@HeikoS	wiking: haha
@HeikoS	+10
 iglesiasg	the idea would still work as long as one can call java code from matlab
 iglesiasg	xD
@HeikoS	wiking: but anyway
@wiking	i mean i've read some googler saying that the next big thing if u wanna have a job landed at googs is matlab
@wiking	i was rotfl for like 10 minutes
 iglesiasg	lol
@wiking	who's that idiot that still uses that shit
 iglesiasg	can't be true
@wiking	i mean no offence
@HeikoS	wiking: any problems with the package?
 iglesiasg	I am using matlab all the time for job :(
@wiking	but matlab is a piece of shit
@wiking	iglesiasg: yeah my condolances :)
@wiking	i reckon it's because of your profs who are living in the dark ages :D
 iglesiasg	together with all the department... (sigh)
@wiking	HeikoS: huh
 iglesiasg	wiking: this is a company, man
@wiking	HeikoS: dont even ask
@wiking	iglesiasg: woah fuuuuuuck
@wiking	that's heavy
@wiking	:)
 iglesiasg	wiking: but anyway, never mind :D
 iglesiasg	let's focus on release!
@wiking	maybe u should show them ipython one day
@wiking	to get blown away
@wiking	:P
 iglesiasg	haha yeah
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	yeah packages

@wiking	i have something going
@wiking	but still needs some love
@wiking	but once i have it
@wiking	we'll have LTS packages rolling into our own ppa
@wiking	dunno if there's something similar for RPM (centos, suse, redhat-alike system)
 lambday	HeikoS: iglesiasg: hey do yoou think we should get rid of SGVector dot as well? we have now linalg dot..
@wiking	but if there is i'll have the rpms as well
 lambday	wiking: ^
@wiking	lambday: awesomeness
 iglesiasg	lambday: if would make sense, did you see this PR where randperm is out?
@wiking	anybody knows suse/centos/redhat/fedora?
 lambday	wiking: yeah I just thought of this seeing that PR only
@wiking	http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6766/is-there-is-a-ppa-service-equivalent-in-the-fedora-world
 iglesiasg	lambday: I am writing an issue about it. The idea is that future wannabe-gsocers will do this sort of cleanup
 lambday	iglesiasg: alright... that make sense
@wiking	https://repos.fedorapeople.org/
@wiking	somebody should register
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah we should, but later
@HeikoS	lambday, iglesiasg *all* methods should be remove from SGVector etc eventually
@HeikoS	these datatype should just be there for mapping data in interfaces
@HeikoS	we should try to make them as lightweight as possible
 lambday	HeikoS: okay... maybe we should provide a native implementation of dot... so that things technically work even without any third party linalg backend..
@HeikoS	lambday: we should, but not as a method of SGVector
 lambday	I'll look into that  -
 lambday	yes inside the same interface only
@HeikoS	lambday: but we should focus on the release for now
@HeikoS	lambday: so maybe pause the things you were doing for a bit?
@HeikoS	lambday: we can need help
@HeikoS	lambday: see for example the points wiking raised
@HeikoS	about swig3
@thoralf	HeikoS: Let me do some quick refactorings of the serialization framework first
@HeikoS	thoralf: are you sure thats a good point in time now?
@wiking	ehhehe yeah why not
@thoralf	:D
@HeikoS	thoralf: I already have a little feature branch that removed migration btw
@wiking	serialization fw sucks :D
 lambday	HeikoS: checking
@HeikoS	thoralf: but it broke all python modular serialisation integration tests
@thoralf	lol
@thoralf	Bad boy.
@HeikoS	thoralf: so cannot merge it now
@HeikoS	thoralf: and dont want to touch all these things
@HeikoS	thoralf: but we should really focus on release and do all the internal cleanups afterwards
@HeikoS	wiking: thats why I wanna get it out asap - so that we start working on fixes without having to worry about release
@HeikoS	lambday: just pick any of the issues and fix them, its probably good  to tell us what youre on to make sure everything is synched
@thoralf	HeikoS: On did't plan touching things if not needed.  No worries.
 lambday	HeikoS: okay are there github issues on this?
@HeikoS	lambday: check out the last two milestones
@HeikoS	lots of lots of issues
@HeikoS	lambday: for example lots of warnings in the modular interfaces
@thoralf	HeikoS: Serious suggestion as entrance task: Write unit tests for typemaps.
 lambday	HeikoS: alrighty..
@HeikoS	thoralf: +1 :) write a github issue!
@HeikoS	lambday: the length of unit tests is also a good fix for release
@HeikoS	lambday: but swig3 would be best, just like wiking said
 lambday	HeikoS: I see an issue on swig3 but it's quite old.. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2313
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
 lambday	HeikoS: oh we need a readme for linalg... this is surely new feature for this release
 lambday	I'll do that
@wiking	yeah that is broken
@wiking	but as u can see for some peeps it's working

 iglesiasg	good night guys
 iglesiasg	I am dead, out of service
@wiking	gnite
@thoralf	iglesiasg: You can sleep tomorrow.
@thoralf	:D
 lambday	night!
@HeikoS	wiking: could you instruct lambday a bit on the swig3 thing?
@HeikoS	lambday:  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2313
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	thats the one you sent
 lambday	I'm reading the logs...
 lambday	hmm.. time to get swigging.. never been much of a swigger :D
@HeikoS	lambday:
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact, for you, the most important thing would be to have a notebook
@HeikoS	lambday: do you think thats feasible soon?
@HeikoS	lambday: should we maybe discuss a bit=?
@HeikoS	lambday: just realised as reading the bits and pieces issue
 lambday	HeikoS: well.. yeah I guess.. when's the release?
 lambday	31st Oct?
 lambday	30th
@HeikoS	last week
@HeikoS	;)
@HeikoS	lambday: really soon, as soon as things are done
@HeikoS	lambday: let me know if you need help with the notebook
@HeikoS	lambday: I remember you had this classification thing?
@HeikoS	lambday: where you could throw away all the data without loosing accuracy?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I was trying out that example..
@HeikoS	lambday: if that works, thats already good. I mean we can and should improve later, but thats already a coherent story
@HeikoS	lambday: if you send me something to review before Wednesday, I can do it super quickly
 lambday	HeikoS: okay let me try that.. ideally I didn't want to do it in a hurry but maybe it's for the best for the release
@HeikoS	lambday: dont try to write the full thing maybe?
 lambday	should have done it within gsoc only though
@HeikoS	lambday: but just a but that has basics and can be extended?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I already started on it - so have some text ready
@HeikoS	lambday: dont worry you did some other great things
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, so dont try to overdo it. for now, short and round is enough
 lambday	HeikoS: okay by wed I'll try to give you something
@HeikoS	lambday: awesome!
@HeikoS	lambday: once release is done, we can really focus on all the other cool stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: checked out your flash things a bit more today
@HeikoS	lambday: excited to talk about that then
 lambday	HeikoS: yep.. there are lots :D
@HeikoS	lambday: ok going to bed too
@HeikoS	good night everyone
