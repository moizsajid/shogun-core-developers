 blackburn	yes
 wiking	:P
 heiko	wiking, btw I just read the word unit test, whats the state of that?
 blackburn	it have longed a month already
 blackburn	has longed :D
 blackburn	I can haz
@sonney2k	blackburn, uhh ranking algorithms
@sonney2k	I've talked to the guy who did that at yahoo
@sonney2k	research
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't care what to do for that money
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	heiko: lol good grep. well the thing is that it's tricky. i have to add extra code into the makefile so that gmock and gtest are compiled with the same flags as shogun. and u need to provide the src of gmock/gtest to shogun to be able to do that
@sonney2k	blackburn, learning to rank is certainly interesting
 wiking	heiko: lot of mindless ./configure and Makefile hacking
 blackburn	if being serious it is researchy
 blackburn	my current job is like a factory worker job
 blackburn	and twice less money
@sonney2k	twice less == half ?
 wiking	blackburn: clearcase!!!!
 blackburn	haha yes
 heiko	wiking, so one downloads gmock/gtest source, and provides path to shogun configure and then everything is done automatically?
 wiking	blackburn: ain't no factory without clearcase :D
@sonney2k	wiking, what is clearcase?
 blackburn	wiking: ain't no sunshine when clearcase
 heiko	wiking, maybe one could even add a script that downloads the google libs via wget or so?
 blackburn	know that song?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: cvs
 wiking	heiko: then u compile those sources with the same flags as shogun and then u have your static libs that u link it to our unittesting objects
 wiking	heiko: and then u are done :)
 wiking	heiko: well actually standard distribs provide them
 heiko	ok, wiking, does ubuntu?
 heiko	there were these problems I remember
 wiking	heiko: gtest yes
 wiking	heiko: gmock no
 wiking	:)
 heiko	k
 wiking	gmock is still a precompiled library :P
 blackburn	sonney2k: when one commits in git other guy in clearcase creates activity, check outs, ...... , commits, check ins, closes activity
 wiking	but in case of gtest it puts the source under /usr/src..
 heiko	Maybe when you are done, you could write a small howto and put it in the test directory
 wiking	sonney2k: that is clearcase ^ :D
 blackburn	and during asks for proper rights, tries to grasp its interface and attempts to kill himself
 wiking	heiko: aintnotime :D
 wiking	heiko: will do after next week maybe
 heiko	wiking, no worries :) I know the problem
 heiko	wiking, what are you up to currenlty?P
 wiking	heiko: paper
 wiking	:>
 wiking	and trying to get within the deadline :D
@sonney2k	heiko, the new doc should appear if tonights nightly_default builds
 heiko	sonney2k, cool thing! whats the link?
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/shogun_tutorial.pdf
@sonney2k	actually latest
@sonney2k	not current
@sonney2k	current doesn't have that
@sonney2k	heiko, feel free to update the website!
@sonney2k	with pointers...
 blackburn	can't open sonney2k
 heiko	sonney2k, ok Ill have a try
 wiking	mm china will dist-upgrade next month :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko well *after* the build tonight
 blackburn	ahh
 heiko	sonney2k, sure
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: buildmaster reconfigured: bot disconnecting]
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 heiko	btw I just wrote a bit more on the MMD stuff
 heiko	we should keep on doing this - very nice thing to have
 heiko	blackburn, I also added a part that explains SHOGUNs structures, like Features, Kernels, etc
 blackburn	heiko: nice
 heiko	And I want to add a part about the model selection soon
@sonney2k	heiko, I can basically copy all kernels form my phd thesis
@sonney2k	so kernel section should be easy
@sonney2k	coffin from some other paper
 heiko	and part of my job will be documentation, so the GP part will be documented soon also
@sonney2k	lets hope it gets accepted
 heiko	sonney2k, cool! add that
@sonney2k	but heiko, last year only orgs of the size of KDE got in
 heiko	sonney2k, really? ok - but I mean we are growing and have quite a community
 heiko	also we need documentation more than anybody else
 heiko	if a Desktop system is not self-explaining it has failed anyways
 wiking	heiko: the 5 or 6 of us u mean? ;)
 heiko	wiking, :D
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build nightly_default
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
 blackburn	heiko: growing?
 blackburn	who's new? :D
 heiko	wiking, sonney2k, blackburn, actually, I do quite some PR for shogun around here, but people really often complain about documentation and that thats the reason they dont use it
@sonney2k	I can believe so
 heiko	blackburn, the 2012 GSOC student for example
 blackburn	heiko: wiking?
 heiko	blackburn, yes for example :)
@sonney2k	if n4nd0 wasn't sleeping so much he would be here too I guess :D
@sonney2k	which reminds me
@sonney2k	I wanted to ask him to put his example in applications
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: pass ;)
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	NOP
 wiking	nopnop
 wiking	:>
 heiko	speaking of sleeping, I will go to bed now, see you all!
 wiking	nite
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-177-179-234.range86-177.btcentralplus.com] has left #shogun []
 blackburn	sonney2k: wiking did I told you I am now mentoring at my current job?
@sonney2k	indeed seems like fish got used to the tank - so I rather sleep now too
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: apparently one my student disappeared
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, maybe you should not mentor shogun then ;-)
 wiking	blackburn: noup, whom/what? :)
@sonney2k	with these fish it is tough to check if they are all around - they are pretty 2d
@sonney2k	so from the wrong angle hard to recognize
 blackburn	wiking: they gave me 2 students to mentor
 blackburn	funny that one (not disappeared one) is of same age as me
 blackburn	but knows no java no patterns nothing
 wiking	blackburn: that happens...
 wiking	"Little is known about his personal life, beyond a liking for basketball and, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable, Hollywood war movies, possibly acquired during a brief stay in Iowa when he was a young man."
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	i bet this guy has all the chuck norris movies :D
 blackburn	wiking: who it is about?
 wiking	blackburn: Xi Jinping
 wiking	the distupgrade guy for china
 wiking	:)
 wiking	blackburn: don't u read other stuff than slashdot? :D
 blackburn	ahh I am not a big fan of china
 blackburn	north korea is my love
 blackburn	wiking: I don't
 wiking	:>
 wiking	blackburn: pravda? :)
 blackburn	wiking: da
 blackburn	wiking: how much time would you able to speak in russian with me? :D
 wiking	nikoliko? :)
 wiking	mislim malo bi mi razumeo ako bi hteo
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	wiking: no idea :D
 wiking	ali russi nekako ne razumeju sprski tako dobro ka srbi razumeju ruski
 wiking	e pa tako
 wiking	;D
 blackburn	ahh
 wiking	NU PA GADJI!!!
 blackburn	wiking: I understand kinda 70%
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	hehhehe
 wiking	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B9XYZqYuN8
 wiking	some oldschool stuff :>
 blackburn	how russians do not understand srpska at all
 wiking	u know nu pagadi?
 wiking	blackburn: yep
 blackburn	so do serbian
 wiking	vidis razumes malo ;)
 blackburn	wiking: come on how can I do not know nu pogodi
 wiking	hehe
 wiking	blackburn: well u've born after soviet union
 blackburn	wiking: before!
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	?!
 wiking	noway
 blackburn	march 1991
 wiking	gorbachov already fixed thing by then
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	so u were born in russia
 wiking	not in soviet union
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	I was born in soviet union
 blackburn	do not mix things :D
 blackburn	soviet union disappeared in december
 blackburn	I was born in march
 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	couple of months
 wiking	doesn't count :P
 blackburn	counts!
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	so yeah this is like true soviet propaganda cartoon
 wiking	love this shit :D
 blackburn	hey no propaganda at all
 blackburn	it is very kind
 wiking	no fucking way: The latest episode was produced in 2006
 wiking	really?!
 wiking	i thought that it was only produced like in 1970's
 blackburn	wiking: well these latest things are not that cool
 blackburn	wiking: I'd say it is soviet propaganda as much as tom&jerry is american propaganda :)
 shogun-buildbot	build #149 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 wiking	blackburn: well t&j is like full on american dream propaganda
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	wiking: okay then I'd say it contains much less propaganda
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	I can't really see anything really soviet
@sonney2k	nite
 blackburn	sonney2k: good night
 blackburn	wiking: have you ever heard john zorn's music?

 sonne|work	heiko: seen that the pdflatex command failed?
 sonne|work	what extra fonts do we need?
 heiko	sonne|work, havent seen, let me check
 heiko	sonne|work another question, do you know when approx. we will get notified whether we are invited to the doc summit?
 sonne|work	in about a week
 heiko	sonne|work, is texlive-fonts-recommended installed?
 sonne|work	no idea
 sonne|work	cannot check from here
 heiko	sonne|work, I think thats it, at least in ubuntu
 heiko	sonne|work, about the doc summit, any guess about our chances? The thing is I would have to fly to Germany and apply for an Express Passport and thats expensive so I would only like to do it if needed. My NIPS travel funding application got neglected so if doc summit doesnt work then I dont need to get the quick passport
 sonne|work	heiko: well I cannot say more - carol said they want to be quick
 sonne|work	so hopefully this week

 yoo	hi all
 sonne|work	heiko1: I wonder why you didn't get selected for nips travel funding. having a paper there used to be enough...
 sonne|work	hi yoo
 heiko1	sonne|work - no idea :(
 sonne|work	I remember having received this grant a couple of times
 sonne|work	but might be that I had an oral (spotlight!)
 sonne|work	or some mixtures of papers, demo & workshop talks
 heiko1	I submitted to a workshop, but these havent been decided yet
 heiko1	sonne|work, I mean its fine, there will be other times
 heiko1	also, once I am in a phd programe, it will be much easier
 heiko1	especially here, people are quite well funded
 heiko1	yoo, is the example that you used the same I sent in the pastebin?
 heiko1	or did you change something,
 heiko1	because it worked here
 yoo	no changes, but you have to change kernels ..
 yoo	Commwordstringker works fine
 yoo	the prob I reported is with the weightedcommstringker
 heiko1	ok
 heiko1	parameters?
 yoo	in my example one of the two kernels was commented
 yoo	same
 yoo	http://pastebin.com/zsKQYPhM
 sonne|work	heiko1: well you have a nips paper w/o being a phd student. that is already quite something!
 heiko1	sonne|work, I know - I would have loved to go there, well lets see
 heiko1	the thing is: the doc summit is in parallel
 heiko1	so there might be still a chance :) but I am not too optimistic about that
 heiko1	yoo, confirmed, I get the same error
 heiko1	yoo, I will have a quick look now
 yoo	one of the features get order = 0 and this cause the error
 heiko1	yoo, looks like a X-Val based error to mee
 heiko1	with subsets on the features not updating the order
 heiko1	sonne|work, the get_order() of string features, what does it do? does it change when a subset is applied?
 sonne|work	no it should stay fixed
 sonne|work	heiko1: basically order == n (from n-gram length)
 sonne|work	so substrings of length n are considered (but this is coded in the features already)
 heiko1	how can this get zero then?
 heiko1	in x-val
 yoo	yes it occurs only with xval
 yoo	weightedcommwordstringker manage several order right ?
 heiko1	yoo, I actually have no idea about this kernel, never looked at it, sonne2y aka sonne|work is the specialist here
 heiko1	yoo, but I think the bug comes from somewhere else
 heiko1	let me investigate a bit further
 sonne|work	yoo: yes spectrum kernel using all orders up to order
 heiko1	sonne|work, wow didnt know that I thought this was called the blended spectrum kernel, good to know that this is there :)
 sonne|work	everyone re-invents the wheel so we have multiple names
 sonne|work	heiko1: but yes that is the one. caution though it needs special args in the obtain_from_string / translate function (see example)
 heiko1	sonne|work, I see, this is exactly where erics bug comes from: store_model_features calls copy_subset which copies a certain part of the data and creates a new stringfeatures instance, but does not call this obtain from char
 heiko1	yoo, so problem solbed, but another one pops up ... :)
 sonne|work	heiko1: hmmhh I don't know - this translation is only done once
 sonne|work	so all subsets should be fine
 heiko1	sonne|work, but this is different
 heiko1	its store_model_features
 heiko1	so it creates a copy of the features object where only a certain subset of the data is included
 sonne|work	heiko1: yes but still
 heiko1	for example, order is not even set
 heiko1	in the new instance
 sonne|work	it should then just copy order and everything and all good
 heiko1	yes did, but now symbol_mask_table is missing
 heiko1	so I was wondering whether there was a more systematic way of just copiying till no more assertion errors
 heiko1	since I might miss something this way
 heiko1	which chages results or so...
 heiko1	what about an embed_features call?
 heiko1	that seems to do it
 heiko1	sonne|work, hope that is fine?
 sonne|work	what would it do?
 heiko1	I now even did differently
 heiko1	result->order=order;
 heiko1	result->compute_symbol_mask_table(result->alphabet->get_num_symbols());
 heiko1	then, at least the code runs through
 heiko1	but I dont know if I changed any semantics this way
 heiko1	yoo, its fixed, submitting patch soon
 heiko1	yoo, maybe you can have a look if the results make sense, I am not too sure whether this fix is correct in terms of that data is not changed or something
 yoo	heiko1: thx allright, I will test it. I am trying to figure out what was the pb, could you explain ?
 heiko1	yoo, the problem was realted to cross.validation
 heiko1	kernel machines have to store the data for the model somehow
 heiko1	but since we are working on subsets, these got changed again when testing on different sets in x-val
 heiko1	thats why they store copies of the data once they computed the alpha terms
 heiko1	and this method wasnt keeping the order for string features
 heiko1	Ill send you the patch, its just two lines
 yoo	okay
 heiko1	yoo, pretty hard to find if you dont know the framework and how cross-validation in shogun works internally
 yoo	good exercice then ..

 wiking	yes
 wiking	why?
 sonne|work	wiking: never mind
 sonne|work	X^{-1}^{-1}^{-1} problem
 blackburn	sonne|work: that must be pretty unstable to compute such matrix :)
 sonne|work	especially when neuron spikes are creating the data
 blackburn	sonne|work: is it possible to hold a code sprint at some conference?
 sonne|work	not officially and usually one is *very* busy at a conference

 sonne|work	blackburn: he is retired :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: no he keeps pushing some his stuff
 blackburn	with lectures etc
 blackburn	sonne|work: just recently he was at MIT
 blackburn	chiyuan posted a few photos

 wiking	:)
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes I have seen him talking about god einstein and himself :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: and he was very upset when oliver said sth. like you don't need kernels :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: don't need kernels for what?
 sonne|work	SVMs
 sonne|work	and no need to do anything in the dual
 sonne|work	haha
 blackburn	he meant linear primal svm?
 sonne|work	but olivier will mentor next year so we won ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: what he wants to mentor?
 sonne|work	yeah. this guy http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/primal_%5b0%5d.pdf
 sonne|work	blackburn: well I talked to him - I told you that helps at times ;)
 blackburn	ah so chapelle
 blackburn	he is an author of some SVM IIRC?
 blackburn	sonne|work: sometimes I feel SVM is stupid
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	replace SVM with $METHOD
 blackburn	sonne|work: we are all too tied to SVM
 blackburn	sonne|work: it seems to be so bad we have no methods but SVM
 wiking	yeah so heiko will make us GP classifiers :)
 blackburn	wiking: they are not better I heard
 sonne|work	blackburn: what is ``better'' then?
 wiking	blackburn: complexity is high but it's autotuning
 blackburn	sonne|work: no idea - accuracy-wise may be
 wiking	so you dont really need to tune your parameters
 wiking	but fuckthisshit
 blackburn	wiking: autotuning is interesting but performance?
 wiking	why my code is not working argh
 blackburn	can one do large scale?
 wiking	as said earlier
 wiking	high complexity
 blackburn	complexity? algorithmic or like in VC?
 wiking	o(n^3)
 wiking	if i remember right
 blackburn	wiking: fuckthishit
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	well getsome/loose some
 wiking	as usual
 blackburn	and we came that everything is useless again
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	well if u give a neural net enough data and time, it'll learn god of course :)
 sonne|work	wiking, blackburn - matrix inversion!
 wiking	where? :D
 sonne|work	*EXPENSIVE*
 wiking	is it coming :)
 sonne|work	GPs
 blackburn	sonne|work: n^3/3 at least yeah
* wiking hides from matrix inversions :D
 sonne|work	and as blackburn said - rock stable stuff
 sonne|work	even more stable than QP optimizers
 sonne|work	haha
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am solving problems with det=1e-9 here come on
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	:>>>
 blackburn	if we are talking about illposed problems dimension reduction that is
 sonne|work	blackburn: at least positive :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: not always, IEEE754 FTW
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	I add 1e-9 to diag
 blackburn	to avoid negative
 sonne|work	even the gaussian kernel can be negative w/ floating point numbers
 wiking	i've heard that in new york they are planning to build a sandy-bridge
 wiking	hehehehe
 wiking	:)
 wiking	i know it was a bad one... :P

 wiking	sonney2k: i saw that yesterday you were talking about narray with heiko
 wiking	sonney2k: i'm missing a resizeable matrix in shogun currently
 wiking	so i was wondering if u guys came to a conclusion...
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build nightly_default
 shogun-buildbot	build #151 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	wiking, SGNDArray is what we talked about
 wiking	sonney2k: and do i recall it right that u were working with dna sequences? :)
@sonney2k	wiking, an N-dimensional array
@sonney2k	wiking, what is a resizable matrix for you?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes but?
 wiking	sonney2k: well i currently have this in the new sosvm
 wiking	std::vector<SGSparseVector<float64_t> >
 wiking	i can resize both the vector and the inner sparsevector
@sonney2k	wiking, why not SGSparseMatrix?
 wiking	without loosing the content of it
@sonney2k	wiking, well you could use SGSparseMatrix.
 wiking	sonney2k: sgsparsematrix has no realloc option
 wiking	or i didn't see and i was blind
 wiking	no it doesn't have a line where it uses sg_realloc
 wiking	nor a function call for resizing
@sonney2k	wiking, std::vector is no different
 wiking	sonney2k: i can resize the vector w/o problems
@sonney2k	it is slow slow slow when resizing
@sonney2k	you need to copy everything
@sonney2k	why not allocate an empty SGSparseMatrix with whatever max number of vectors you need?
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but it same you could do with SGSparseMatrix
 wiking	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/resize/
 wiking	sonney2k: you mean to add a new function to it? :)
 wiking	and about the dna thing i was just looking for data set and thought you might have something or know somebody who would have something
@sonney2k	wiking, yes sure - it is not exactly magic to do so. but I would rather resize in big chunks - but no idea if the resizing is time critical in your case
@sonney2k	wiking, what exactly are you looking for?
 wiking	no it's it's not time critical that much... i mean there are other parts of that sosvm that are way slower so this wouldn't really slow down the thing
 wiking	sonney2k: motif finding
@sonney2k	wiking, ok - and you really need sparse not SGStringList right?
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	the two things are not really related
@sonney2k	wiking, no I mean instead of your sparse vector / matrix list
 wiking	well i only need to be
 wiking	to resize both horizontally and vertically the matrix
 wiking	without all the time maintaining
 wiking	the values
@sonney2k	wiking, well SGStringList is the dense variant of SGSparseMatrix
@sonney2k	wiking, actually a list of vectors
 wiking	yeah but it's the same deal
 wiking	i cannot resize this dynamically
@sonney2k	wiking, well the same way
@sonney2k	anyways you could do a couple of things but they all take quite some time
 shogun-buildbot	build #151 of nightly_default is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/151
 wiking	hehe http://imgur.com/t5Qvz
 wiking	:>
 wiking	blackburn: ^
 blackburn	wiking: :)
@sonney2k	hurray

 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	wtf is this turbo boost ?
 wiking	are we back to the 90s?
