 blackburn	hey n4nd0
 blackburn	how are you?
 n4nd0	hi!
 n4nd0	I am fine, just came back home from a coding day :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: what about you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is coding day? some event?
 blackburn	I am working on the second test task for job :D
 n4nd0	yeah, that I've spent the day coding
 n4nd0	a contest at the university
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	that's quite popular out there too
 n4nd0	blackburn: so what are these tasks for the job?
 blackburn	n4nd0: they cancelled first one due to user agreement restrictions of that service I analyzed
 blackburn	funny :D
 blackburn	so they gave me C++ task
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	but this is for the new job you told me about?
 blackburn	yes yes that one
 n4nd0	oh cool, then it is awesome
 n4nd0	and what is it that you are doing?
 blackburn	well it is simple but they asked me to do it like I'm doing serious business thing :)
 n4nd0	hehe, so what is it?
 blackburn	there are aggregates (containing parts, each having signature - a set of integers)
 blackburn	given part I need to find nearest aggregates
 blackburn	i.e. aggregates having parts most similar to the specified one
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	it could be hardcoded for sure
 blackburn	but I am (R) (TM) experienced java enterprise (TM) developer :D lol
 blackburn	ok joking, still hardcode is bad and it is worth to implement it in a flexible way
 blackburn	like instances of 'parts' should be created by factory not manually all around the code
 blackburn	and I prefer to have a singleton to provide data access routines
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 blackburn	and I use a lot of std finally :D
 blackburn	good chance to learn it for the first time
 n4nd0	I have used some factory classes and heard about the singleton but I am not sure I really understand what are the advantages of following these patterns
 blackburn	and sonney2k I like it
 n4nd0	I love everything from the c++ standard, std rocks!
 blackburn	n4nd0: during the runtime of that program I have to have some pointer to the object that manages entities
 blackburn	there are a few ways
 blackburn	like dependency injection in java when some server puts a reference to that object automatically in all objects
 blackburn	you may also handle it manually but you know not the best way to handle everything manually
 blackburn	or you can EntityManager::get_instance().do_something()
 blackburn	anywhere
 blackburn	(I assume one needs only one 'entity manager' during the runtime)
 blackburn	that's exactly singleton for
 n4nd0	I'll probably get the idea if I have to use it some time :)
