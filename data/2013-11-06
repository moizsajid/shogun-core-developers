 thoralf	sonne|work: Oh, cool.  Thanks!
 thoralf	Will test it in a minute.
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
 thoralf	sonne|work: Works perfectly, thank you.
 thoralf	sonne|work: There are still some smaller leaks related to _wrap_new_SparseRealFeatures, but in total it's 230kb after 100 iterations.
 sonne|work	thoralf: please rerun valgrind with this origin thingy
 sonne|work	that it says at the bottom
 sonne|work	otherwise it is hard to figure out where / what
 sonne|work	thoralf: some stuff might be python and no real leak
 sonne|work	wiking: that bug is rather important and if we intend to release 3.0.1 this should be definitely in
@wiking	mmm
 sonne|work	mmm what?
 thoralf	sonne|work: New output with same script as before: https://gist.github.com/tklein23/7333816
 thoralf	sonne|work: I only copy-pasted the shogun-related stuff.
 thoralf	sonne|work: approx. 230kb after 100 iterations, so it's not critical any more.
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@wiking	sonne|work: well we can create then a hotfix branch for it
-!- new_lido [~walid@193.227.20.2] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
@wiking	sonne|work: but you've already commited the fix
@wiking	anyhow we can make an easy 3.0.1 release i think
 sonne|work	thoralf: could you please create a minimal example with that other leak?
 sonne|work	and here valgrind line numbers don't make sense
 thoralf	sonne|work: I just did: https://gist.github.com/tklein23/7333816
 sonne|work	I need this with -O0 to make sense
 sonne|work	thoralf: I guess you don't even need liblinear for that
 sonne|work	thoralf: maybe just passing the sparse matrix to shogun is sufficient
 thoralf	I see, I'll check.

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: drop inplace new for sparse vector (no longer needed...) and create SGSparseVector directly
 sonne|work	thoralf: that commit ^ might even fix it...
 thoralf	Oh, I just updated the gist: https://gist.github.com/tklein23/7333816
 thoralf	Let me rebuild with your fix.
 sonne|work	thoralf: would fit...
 sonne|work	lets see
 thoralf	Hmm.  Failed unit tests: python_modular-structure_factor_graph_model (SEGFAULT)
 thoralf	sonne|work: The leak disappeared.
 thoralf	But I've got a failing unit test, but I think it was already failing yesterday.
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@97e0a10b.skybroadband.com] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS	sonney2k: the satzung already includes that every member of the vorstand is able to represent shogun to the world
 HeikoS	so we can do the voting now
 HeikoS	Once thats done, I will quickly write the protocol of the founding process, and then ready to register

 combi	Is there a way to install shogun on a Linux machine with an old version of cmake?
 combi	I don't have admin privileges, just FYI
 combi	One machine has cmake 2.6.4 and another doesn't even have it.
 combi	Mainly I'd like to gain access to the MKL implementation using Python if possible.
@iglesiasg	hey combi

@iglesiasg	all right, bye then :D
 sonne|work	HeikoS, nice!
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: so do the voting then!
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I am just waiting for Heiko's answer
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I mean send this thing around - seems like you only have to write heiko and me are candidates for the vorstand
@iglesiasg	although you can tell me about it too
@iglesiasg	I am not sure whether I should include besser82 already in the votation or not
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: did you read what he just said ~1hr ago?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: sure do it
@iglesiasg	yep
@iglesiasg	ok, then I am preparing it pretty soon!
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, by this afternoon the mails are sent around already
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: thx
 besser82	sonne|work: I still didn't get a copy of the satzung to sign nor an adress to send it back to :(
 sonne|work	besser82: I can send you the thing
 besser82	sonne|work: That would be great  :D
 besser82	sonne|work: Seems like nobody read my reply on Fernando's email two days ago  :(
 sonne|work	besser82: about what?
@iglesiasg	besser82, I did ;) You are not alone :P
 besser82	sonne|work: It was about SHOGUN foundation - it starts
 besser82	sonne|work: and HeikoS wrote I just need to sign the satzung && snail-mail it to you  :)
 sonne|work	besser82: I only read the one about you sending it to me signed
 sonne|work	yeah I read that
 sonne|work	but since the satzung was not ready
 sonne|work	I didn't reply yet
 besser82	sonne|work: Ahhh, that makes sense  ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, just forwarded you a prev mail in that thread including the Satzung
@iglesiasg	cannot assure it is the very last version though
 besser82	iglesiasg: +1  Thanks!
@iglesiasg	welcome
 besser82	sonne|work: So i got the satzung in revision from 03.11. now. Is that the recent thing?
 sonne|work	besser82: heiko would knoq
 sonne|work	know
