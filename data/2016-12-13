 CaBa	wiking: nthreads detection on linux is still broken?
@wiking	CaBa, in develop yes
@wiking	there's a feature/KernelOMP branch
@wiking	where its fixed
 CaBa	wiking: setting it manyally is fine, or are there any other implications?
@wiking	if you set manually it's ok
 CaBa	wiking: have the mac specific optimization flags found their way in the cmake config?
 CaBa	wiking: have you actually benchmarked the difference?
@wiking	mac specific?
@wiking	the -mtunes=native
@wiking	is not mac specific
@wiking	and yes it'll be a huge diff
@wiking	as you'll start to use some features of your cpu
@wiking	that are currently neglected
 CaBa	wiking: -march you mean?
@wiking	yesh that
@wiking	read about it on gcc or clang
 CaBa	i have quite strange performance issues at times... but probably unrelated to that
 CaBa	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/compare/develop...lkuchenb:feature/syncC1C2
 CaBa	wiking: do you think something like this might make it into upstream?
 CaBa	wiking: i didn't see another way to bind C1/C2 during model selection
 CaBa	wiking: and i think it's quite useful...
 CaBa	i'm not sure

 ConfusedGrammer	Hey, I'm finally at the point where I can start trying to apply open
 ConfusedGrammer	*openacc pragma directives to the algorithms within the shogun algorithm to paralalyze the algorithms I need to complete my project.
 ConfusedGrammer	Anyone in here (specifically the developers) have any quick tips I might need to know?
 ConfusedGrammer	There doesn't really seem to be much guidance on the subject in the shogun stack overflow
