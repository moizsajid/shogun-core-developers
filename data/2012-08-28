 yoo	hi
 yoo	I have a question about mkl classification
 yoo	using p-norm mkl and the example below
 yoo	http://pastebin.com/CZY9NbYs
 yoo	with p=1 no problem
 yoo	with p>1 I get different results according of orders the kernels are "append" to CombinedKernel
 yoo	regardless to the order the kernels are added, the first kernel always get a big weight ...
 n4nd0	yoo: what classifier are you using?
 n4nd0	it looks like there are some bugs with MKL and SVMLight
 yoo	I am using MKLMulticlass
 yoo	Could you confirm me the "bug" I get running the code below
 yoo	http://pastebin.com/CZY9NbYs
 yoo	despite those results, I dont know if its a real bug
 yoo	Is there another mkl multiclass machine than CMKLMulticlass ?
 n4nd0	give me a sec
 yoo	Maybe CMKLMulticlass support only 1-norm ?
 n4nd0	I am not sure about that, I have never used this part of the project but I am checking
 yoo	thanks
 n4nd0	about other MKL multiclass classes
 n4nd0	I think there is an MKLMulticlassGradient and MKLMulticlassGLPK
 n4nd0	did you see those?
 n4nd0	yoo: in the doc of MKLMulticlass, it says that it is a class for L1-norm - so yes, I guess it is only for L1-norm
 yoo	yes but MKLMulticlassGradient and MKLMulticlassGLPK are helpers for MKLMulticlass
 n4nd0	yoo: aham, I understand
 yoo	mmmh
 n4nd0	however there are some things related about pnorm begin >= 1
 n4nd0	being, sorry
 yoo	in the MKLMulticlass norm
 yoo	void CMKLMulticlass::set_mkl_norm(float64_t norm) { pnorm=norm; if(pnorm<1 ) SG_ERROR("CMKLMulticlass::set_mkl_norm(float64_t norm) : parameter pnorm<1"); }

-!- n4nd0_ is now known as n4nd0
 n4nd0	yeah ok so the norm shouldn't be less than 1
 n4nd0	but your problem was with norm greater than 1 right?
 yoo	yes of course
 n4nd0	I think it should work fine with pnorm>=1
 yoo	:)
 n4nd0	mmm
 yoo	allright could you just run the code I sent you, set p-norm with p=1.5 for example
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	let's see
 yoo	and then change the order of the kernels
 yoo	"the order you call cker->append_kernel()"
 yoo	and tell me if you get correct results : meaning same weights with different corresponding orders
 n4nd0	ok
 yoo	(thanks :p )
 n4nd0	there was a compile error btw, line 21 missing a "
 yoo	certainly when passing code to pastebin
 yoo	yes, because you need to set your path to shogun example data
 n4nd0	yeah, the weights are different
 n4nd0	firs time
 n4nd0	weights=[0.772121228165275508,0.355850164735586394,0.228543243936139867]
 n4nd0	second
 n4nd0	weights=[0.807646890960066477,0.372222999073939242,0.13038554325345969]
 n4nd0	and I just switched two calls to append
 yoo	thats strange
 n4nd0	I certainly don't know
 n4nd0	I don't know much about MKL apart from what the acronym means :S
 yoo	because linear kernel give poor results but when you place it in the first position, it takes 80% of weights ..
 yoo	I am not very used to it too
 yoo	maybe I can come back later. Could you keep the attached code and ask to people who wrote the code ?
 n4nd0	have you checked that the other parts of your example are correct?
 n4nd0	for example, I am not very sure if I understand why before each call to append_kernel you call append_feature_obj?
 yoo	yes I think this part is correct. append_features is called for each kernel since the features could be different for each kernels.
 yoo	from doc "It keeps pointers to the added sub-features and is especially useful to  combine kernels working on different domains (c.f. CCombinedKernel) and to  combine kernels looking at independent features."
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	but the thing is that for the kernels you are using, all of them use the same features
 n4nd0	then I am not really sure why to append the same features several times
 yoo	because you need CCombinedFeatures object ?
 yoo	if not : segfault " Number of features/kernels does not match - bailing out "
 n4nd0	aham ok, you are probably right
 yoo	but one more time, I am not an expert ..
 n4nd0	me neither
 n4nd0	take a look at python_modular example though
 n4nd0	mkl_multiclass_modular.py
 yoo	ok i'll do that right now
 yoo	give me a minute
 n4nd0	as you can see there the features are not given in the constructor to the individual kernels
 n4nd0	maybe that doesn't make a difference but let's better be sure
 yoo	and they test p-norm with p =1.5 or 2.0
 n4nd0	true
 yoo	but I can see : feats_train.append_feature_obj(subkfeats_train)
 n4nd0	yes
 yoo	3 time fr each kernel
 yoo	what d you mean "he features are not given in the constructor to the individual kernels" ?
 yoo	oh I see
 yoo	!
 n4nd0	I have run the test like that
 n4nd0	and it seems that the weights still vary
 n4nd0	if one changes the order of them
 n4nd0	of the kernels I mean
 yoo	yes me too
 yoo	did you run it in python or c++ ?
 n4nd0	C++
 n4nd0	have you tried changing them in python?
 yoo	not yet
 n4nd0	let me know when you have
 yoo	is there a get_kernel_weights method in python ?
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	if you are using it from libshogun interface, it should be available from python modular
 n4nd0	yoo: did you find any problem trying it?
 yoo	here is the code if you want to test it
 yoo	http://pastebin.com/VGMCb2UY
 yoo	change the path to inputs
 n4nd0	so what did you find?
 yoo	the same pb ..
 yoo	work well only with 1-norm
 n4nd0	mmmm
 n4nd0	I have just tested it in python
 n4nd0	changing the other of the kernels introduced
 yoo	and ?
 n4nd0	using 1.5 norm
 n4nd0	the weights do not change
 n4nd0	sometimes there's a small variation in the last weight
 n4nd0	but it is about e-13 so I guess that is normal
 yoo	but they should right ? if you change the order
 yoo	values should stay the same in different ordrers
 n4nd0	well I guess they are given in that ascending order
 yoo	no way
 yoo	they are given in the order you ve called append
 yoo	just try with 1-norm, you will see
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	lol this is a funny one
 n4nd0	when I change the norm from 1.5 to 1
 n4nd0	SystemError: [ERROR] glpk.h from GNU glpk not included at compile time necessary here
 yoo	ouch
 yoo	dont get that
 yoo	outputs are
 yoo	[ 0.97250202  0.02749798  0.        ]
 yoo	[ 0.97250202  0. 0.02749798     ]
 yoo	works fine
 n4nd0	for which example?
 n4nd0	norm 1 you mean right?
 yoo	yes
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	yeah what I said about the ascending order is probably stupid
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ping
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you know something about a problem using MKL with norm>=1?
 n4nd0	it looks like yoo gets different weights depending on the order he includes the subkernels
 yoo	http://pastebin.com/CZY9NbYs and http://pastebin.com/VGMCb2UY for reproducing in c++/python

 yoo	n4nd0: could you keep me inform if you have news on this issue ? (thereisnoknife@gmail.com)
 n4nd0	yoo: ah so you are the HM-SVM guy too! :)
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	but probably they will say something about this here at the chat
 n4nd0	it will be in the logs
 n4nd0	but I'll tell you if I see any answer about it posted

 yoo	blackburn: hi
 yoo	blackburn: I have not finished the compilation procedure of shogun using cmake, it turns out there is severals macro to handle
 blackburn	yoo: macro like?
 yoo	blackburn: I have encountered pbs testing mklmulticlass as you can see in the chat logs, have you already experienced smthg similar ?
 heiko1	blackburn, how to use this python script you sent around for extracting code?
 yoo	-DUSE_*
 heiko1	could you give me your call?
 blackburn	yoo: yes I've seen
 blackburn	heiko1: hmm let me remember
 blackburn	heiko1: python % -s [since_date] -b [end of gsoc date]
 n4nd0	heiko1: where is that script?
 heiko1	blackburn, which format is the date?
 heiko1	and do I have to put my name somewhere?
 blackburn	heiko1: oops
 blackburn	n4nd0: heiko1: http://inspirated.com/2011/08/23/tarball-generator-for-git-commits
 n4nd0	thanks
 blackburn	?     ??????????????                    ?????
 blackburn	oops I was cleaning my kboard

 heiko1	damn it doesnt work
 heiko1	strange error messages
 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	shouldn't there be something built in git to extract a patch?
 heiko1	n4nd0 does it work for you?
 n4nd0	didn't try
 heiko1	argh, always this messy stuff ;)
 yoo	n4nd0: yes I am testing most of the training machines and get used to those

 heiko1	blackburn, did the script work for you?
 heiko1	I get tar error messages
 heiko1	Think I am too stupid to use it
 n4nd0	but isn't it the tar.gz empty?
 blackburn2	heiko1: well I used it last year but no I didn't try yet
 heiko1	blackburn, I see
 heiko1	n4nd0 which download?
 heiko1	I use the once from sergeys mail
 n4nd0	aah I was checking the one from the link he sent
-!- yoo [2eda6d52@gateway/web/freenode/ip.46.218.109.82] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 n4nd0	I don't have that one from the mail
 heiko1	Ill send it
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.168.3.80] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 n4nd0	thanks
 n4nd0	it seems that I completely ignored that mail :O
 blackburn2	heiko1: it must be the same
 heiko1	blackburn, any updates on the release? I feel bad for having so little time currently ... :(
 blackburn2	heiko1: I would say we are mostly ready
 heiko1	blackburn, nice, I will add a few things today which I discussed with Arthur ....
 heiko1	still the serialisation is missing right?
 blackburn2	heiko1: I am missing its status to be honest
 blackburn2	what is wrong with serialization?
 heiko1	blackburn, memory leaking :)
 heiko1	reference counts not being stored
 heiko1	examples failing
 blackburn2	super :D
 heiko1	(leaking=failing in this case)
 yoo_	have to go, see you later
 heiko1	n4nd0, blackburn got it :)
 heiko1	(the git extract)
 heiko1	the script fails if the git log ist is empty
 heiko1	this can be checked with git log --author= ....

 n4nd0	heiko1: how did you do?
 n4nd0	I get
 heiko1	I had a typo in my name before
 n4nd0	tar: *: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
 n4nd0	tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
 n4nd0	test.tar.gz created
 heiko1	yes
 n4nd0	so we have to use our git name
 heiko1	git log --author='Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>'
 heiko1	if this works, plug it into the script
 heiko1	oh
 heiko1	and you have to delete line 35 in the script
 heiko1	process.wait()
 heiko1	this causes a deadlock
 blackburn2	haha sorry I thought it is working
 heiko1	Ill send an example to the list
 heiko1	n4nd0, blackburn, see mail
 n4nd0	heiko1: thanks!
 blackburn2	thanks
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	heiko1: are you going to upload that as code sample?
 heiko1	n4nd0, just asking myself that :)
 heiko1	there have been many emails on the list
 heiko1	but I deleted all of them :)
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	it looks like some people just submitted this
 n4nd0	I think I will submit this
 n4nd0	and some simpler example
 blackburn2	probably nobody takes care of that
 n4nd0	like the things we prepare for python_modular
 blackburn2	:D
 heiko1	oh n4nd0
 heiko1	sorry
 heiko1	I did read your question wrong
 heiko1	yes you can submit that
 heiko1	We all did that last year
 n4nd0	ok
 heiko1	but where?
 heiko1	(thought you were asking that)
 n4nd0	heiko1: in melange
 n4nd0	in the page of your project
 n4nd0	just press edit there
 n4nd0	heiko1: the script didn't create the tar.gz for me directly, I had to give it an output like /home/....../gsoc.tar.gz
 heiko1	n4nd0, edit?
 heiko1	ah found it
