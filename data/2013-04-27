 dvalcarce	hi
 dvalcarce	sorry for being disappeared this week
 dvalcarce	i've been busy with projects and exams
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, i like ideas 1 and 3, i don't know if they are still available
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce: I hope the exams/projects went well ;)
 dvalcarce	thx, i expect that too :)
 dvalcarce	hi,foulwall, have you decided what project you want to do?

 foulwall	Hi dvalcarce
 dvalcarce	hi foulwall
 foulwall	I've submitted my proposal, I chose 1.
 dvalcarce	ok, then i will go after 3
 foulwall	dvalcarce: if I finish the demos early, I will help you.
 foulwall	dvalcarce: have you wrote your proposal.
 dvalcarce	that would be great
 dvalcarce	no, not yet

 dvalcarce	this week i didn't have much time
 dvalcarce	and i didn't know if you had chosen a project
 foulwall	dvalcarce: sonney2k suggest me write my proposal for the demos, so I chose the first one.
 foulwall	dvalcarce: if you interested in implementing the demos, I can rewrite my proposal for the 3 :)
 dvalcarce	no, no, it's not necesary :)
 dvalcarce	i like both projects
 dvalcarce	but thanks :)
@lisitsyn	foulwall: dvalcarce: you are free to send multiple proposals
-!- abinash [75ef5e6e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.239.94.110] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce, foulwall: if you are both interested in both projects; my suggestion is go ahead and send proposals to both
 abinash	what does interfacing an external library via modular interface mean?
 foulwall	iglesiasg: lisitsyn: Thanks for reminding
-!- deerishi [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 foulwall	dvalcarce: What's your opinion? write both?
@lisitsyn	foulwall: dvalcarce: can you please remind me what ideas you are talking about?
 dvalcarce	foulwall: if they recommend us, i think we should
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	nice point
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce: but it's not me making the choice either :)
 dvalcarce	lisitsyn: we are talking about web demos and shogun web ui
@lisitsyn	oh alright I see
 dvalcarce	:P
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce: another guy and I were in a similar situation last year -- we apply to the two projects we were interested in
@iglesiasg	and let the captains decide :)
@lisitsyn	dvalcarce: foulwall: it gives us more freedom to assign students
 dvalcarce	haha
 foulwall	lisitsyn: 1) do graphical demos for everythign that is in shogun
 foulwall	lisitsyn: 2) do shogun applications
 foulwall	lisitsyn: 3) do a machine learning web framework
@lisitsyn	alright
@lisitsyn	foulwall: dvalcarce: I wouldn't expect to get some of sonney2k time on weekend so talk to Soeren next week
 foulwall	lisitsyn: ok
@lisitsyn	the closer it is to the deadline the clearer it is so we will see
 dvalcarce	lisitsyn: all right
 foulwall	lisitsyn: How many slots did shogun get last year?
@lisitsyn	foulwall: 9
@lisitsyn	and we sent one back
 foulwall	lisitsyn: I've heard that :)
 abinash	Hello anyone can please help me in understanding what does interfacing an external library via modular interface mean?
@iglesiasg	abinash: hey, where did you read it? ideas page?
 abinash	Yes from the idea Interface and develop the general quadratic solver library libqp
@iglesiasg	abinash: that you can access libqp via shogun modular interfaces

@iglesiasg	abinash: hehe I am just re-writing mostly
 abinash	iglesiasg: Ok does that mean inclusion of libqp within the mathematics folder
@iglesiasg	abinash: where to put it is a minor detail
@iglesiasg	abinash: it means it should be accesible from python and other interfaces via SWIG
 abinash	iglesiasg: Ok I got it

 dvalcarce	I hope you like it :)
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce: can we see it somewhere?

 mdragan	Hello everyone! @lisitsyn, I have a question regarding the example for sparse inverse covariance (issue 863).
 deerishi	@HeikoS : i executed the command "python generator.py preprocessor_kpca.py".that should generate the test file?rite?
@HeikoS	deerishi: yes, you should see some output preprocessor_kpca.py OK
 deerishi	u said that the file would come in tests/data
 deerishi	but nothing as such is coming
 deerishi	i ran the python generator.py  command with a couple of more files,but no such results/output came
 deerishi	any suggestions?
 deerishi	@HeikoS : u der?
@HeikoS	deerishi: yes sorry
 mdragan	@lisitsyn: What should I use as input data for the sic estimation? The example in the sugested paper is applied to proteomics and the input dataset includes variables from 11 proteins for 7000 cells (observations). But the data is not public (I guess).
@HeikoS	let me check
@HeikoS	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun/tests/integration/python_modul
@HeikoS	ar$ python generator.py regression_gaussian_process_modular.py
@HeikoS	regression_gaussian_process_modular                          OK

@HeikoS	ist created
@HeikoS	if not, try use the exact path of the example as input for generator
 deerishi	will try this one more ,n post the results on github in a few minutes

@sonney2k	HeikoS, I wonder why we always have constant variance - not good.
 vgorbati	sonney2k, HeikoS, lisitsyn, wiking: it looks like all the main developers are here - good chance to ask my question:) I am preparing my application for the 'Improve dimensionality reduction module', and my question is: what is the main information you want to see in the application (apart from project ideas/schedule and my background)?
 vgorbati	sonney2k, HeikoS, lisitsyn, wiking: also, any suggestions would be very appreciated
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: well we have a doc describing a few things we would like to see
@sonney2k	vgorbati, yeah what are you missing from the template?
@sonney2k	all applications we have received so far followed this structure...
 vgorbati	I just wanted to ask beforehand whether there is something more, but if no - then I will just follow the template)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: apart from that - not really but if you have suggestions..
 vgorbati	lisitsyn:no, no suggestions:) Okay, then I will just follow the template, thanks for your answers
@sonney2k	vgorbati, well the schedule and description about you (who you are/skills/what you contributed) are most important
 vgorbati	sonney2k: understood, thanks.

@sonney2k	dvalcarce, did you see what I meant?
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, btw a colorbar would also be very helpful
 mikhailBelous	wonder if he intrested in me.
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, yes, i understand what you mean
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: we do require contributions from all students to be accepted - please keep that in mind
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, but the countour plot of a perceptron is linear
 dvalcarce	I can try to emphasize the colorscale
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I don't understand what you mean
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, these colors are nice - but it is not clear which point will be classified as +1 and which as -1
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, ah ok
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, should I add a colorbar?
@sonney2k	so contourline at f(x)=0.0 etc helps
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, would be nice
@sonney2k	then one can see if we have a range of -0.001 ... 0.1
@sonney2k	or -100 ... 100
 dvalcarce	all right
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, one more thing
 dvalcarce	i talked to foulwall this morning
 dvalcarce	he said he will go for the demo project (#1)
@sonney2k	yes
 dvalcarce	I was thinking about projects #1 and #3
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, so?
 dvalcarce	lisitsyn and iglesiasg recommend us to send multiple proposals
@lisitsyn	oh guys I found a way how to remember when the gsoc ends
 dvalcarce	it's that ok?
@lisitsyn	just recall earth wind and fire 'september' song :D
@lisitsyn	they missed two days though :(
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, so you apply for two ideas you mean?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, exactly
@sonney2k	I thought one big application :)
@lisitsyn	ah bad boy dvalcarce doesn't believe me ;)
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: like that guy
@lisitsyn	that speaks machine code
 dvalcarce	:P
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, well yes when there are conflicts it helps
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, but I would want to push you into #3
@lisitsyn	dvalcarce: http://www.noisyroom.net/blog/respect.jpg :D
@sonney2k	of course we have to hope that we get enough slots from google
@sonney2k	otherwise we have to make grief causing hard decisions (not just for students but us too)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh
 dvalcarce	haha, of course, I understand
 dvalcarce	in fact, I prefer idea #3
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, so if you have any time once the contour / colorbar works better do stuff in that direction
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, i am gonna finish contour now
 dvalcarce	and tomorrow, i will work on idea #3
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, like e.g. write some small system that allows registered users to upload a small (size limit!) .csv file that is purely numerical

@lisitsyn	sounds like a startup
@lisitsyn	here comes the motto

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, c'mon there must be one somewhere on maledives
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I bet they cost much more :D
@sonney2k	it just has to stay above sea surface level for the next say 60 years
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: 1 million is the minimal thievery level here in my country so it is just nothing
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, hmmhh what do you think shouldn't we better also extract the demos from shogun-web?
@sonney2k	I am tempted to say yes
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I think it would be convenient
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, bah then become a minimal thief and *help me out* ;)
 dvalcarce	because they are kinda independent
 shogun-buildbot	build #372 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/372
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, just do some most worty victim predictor
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: if I was repairing roads here I could eat money
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, so 3 repos right: shogun-web,shogun-demos,shogun-<weneedaname>
@lisitsyn	because each km costs more than your island
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, golden roads
@sonney2k	looks like it is true what is said about russia
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: one magazine once compared
@lisitsyn	what could be placed instead of an road
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, shogun-temple?
@lisitsyn	with such cost
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: temple? :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: and it is like it could be *totally* covered by a few dollar notes layers
@sonney2k	for the SaaS thing
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah temple sounds crazy enough
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what is said about russia btw?
@lisitsyn	I wonder if you heard about roads :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, maybe better bakufu
@lisitsyn	no idea what it is
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: japanese names are in use by heroku :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: why don't you like your native german crazy words
@sonney2k	"house of the general"
@sonney2k	german is boring
@lisitsyn	why shogun but not Oberbefehlshaber
@sonney2k	or blitzkrieg
@lisitsyn	yes blitzkrieg is nice
@sonney2k	some might disagree
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, shogun-baikufu !
@sonney2k	sry
@sonney2k	bakufu
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: eierlegendewollmilchsau is nice too
 dvalcarce	haha
@lisitsyn	it makes the naming totally impossible to remember
 dvalcarce	shogun-oktoberfest?
 dvalcarce	people will remember it :P
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: actually blitzkrieg would be a nice name if it didn't fail :D
@lisitsyn	otherwise that would mean something like an attempt to do the deal fast and get cold and die
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, or shogunate ... http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/541431/shogunate
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: you know I don't like anything japanese :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, like shogun :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah I don't really like the naming but it is that :)
