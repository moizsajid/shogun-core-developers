 wiking	aaaaaaaaaaaaaasd
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
 wiking	hohohooooo
 wiking	so lisitsyn do u do nowadays ML
 wiking	?
 wiking	:)
 wiking	man ml in industry is nothing else just fucking ETL
 wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah performance ads
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	what models r u using?
 lisitsyn	neural, linear etc
 wiking	:S
 wiking	envy u
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	why?
 wiking	man the projects i've seen lately
 wiking	...
 wiking	it's like etl here this, and etl there this...
 wiking	and then calculate an avg :)
 lisitsyn	ah
 wiking	but fuck scala :)
 wiking	started to really like that language
 wiking	and i'm totally disappointed by python :(
 lisitsyn	wiking: really? I always think of scala like a C++ on steroids and JVM
 wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	like very complex monster
 wiking	well yeah jvm is a downer
 wiking	but man its crazy expressive
 wiking	like 2 lines in scala is like 10-15 lines in java
 lisitsyn	yeah that's true
 wiking	have u seen kotlin? :D
 wiking	http://kotlinlang.org/
 wiking	runs on jvm as well
 lisitsyn	oh that's a joke no?
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	like 1st april
 wiking	nono
 wiking	it's really nice
 wiking	u have traits like in scala
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am like afraid of non-mature langs
 lisitsyn	:)
 wiking	heheh yeah
 lisitsyn	wiking: milf langs are better
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	perl? :D
 lisitsyn	time proven
 lisitsyn	yeah perl bash C
 lisitsyn	:)
 wiking	mmm perl is crazy
 wiking	i cannot take that language
 lisitsyn	yeah me too
 wiking	python is a shit
 wiking	performance of that language is like ....
 lisitsyn	I like C and C++ actually
 wiking	yeah
 lisitsyn	C is wonderful
 wiking	true good stuff
 lisitsyn	C++ is kind of monster
 lisitsyn	but C is concise and cool
 wiking	yeh the only problem i have with c/c++
 wiking	is that it takes a lot of code to do a simple thing
 wiking	i mean in kotlin the crazy thing is the non-nullable type :
 wiking	:D
 wiking	c/c++ is awesome but then when i just want to do something fast then i'm kind of like... fuck, what do i use
 wiking	and that's why i started to like scala....
 wiking	it's crazy expressive
 wiking	and performance wise it's nice
 lisitsyn	cool
 wiking	and i always liked functional programming :)))
 wiking	the problem was that they were kind of fucking useless :)))))
 wiking	except haskell
 lisitsyn	wiking: ocaml!
 wiking	hahaha lol
 wiking	that language is a mess
