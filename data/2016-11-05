 HeikoS_mobile	wiking: still awake?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	did the release
@wiking	fixing the automation
 HeikoS_mobile	Auto or manual?
 HeikoS_mobile	Ah cool
 HeikoS_mobile	I'll check
@wiking	it needs a bit more
@wiking	but i'm already in the last steps
 HeikoS_mobile	Can't sleep due to Jetlag anyways

-!- HeikoS_mobile [~Mutter@host-92-0-178-129.as43234.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@wiking	what?
@HeikoS	checking the release buildbot
@HeikoS	wiking: can I help with something?
@wiking	note really
@wiking	*not
@HeikoS	is anything online changed yet?
@wiking	yeah some stuff
@wiking	cookbooks are generated
@wiking	notebooks needs fixing
@HeikoS	the tree one
@HeikoS	can I fix a warning?=
@HeikoS	or does that break things=?
@HeikoS	in develop
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	plz dont push anything now
@wiking	since i need buildbot
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	wiking: feature branch ok then I guess?
@wiking	yep

@wiking	ok now the only thing that needs fixing maybe is the ppa
@wiking	HeikoS, there's no link for the doxygen on the website
@wiking	HeikoS, http://beta.shogun.ml/api/latest/index.html
@wiking	and i would need a script that extracts the right png from the notebook :)
@wiking	because currently we are not generating images for the showroom
@wiking	anyhow now the notebooks are being compiled
@wiking	the only other thing failed was the data archive generator
@wiking	should be fixed as well
@HeikoS	wiking: yep I know about doxygen, for now it is only referenced from the cookbook
@HeikoS	I think that is OK for this release, I will fix this later, let me put issue
@wiking	yep would be cool to add a top level link to it
@wiking	HeikoS, just add on the top of the webpage
@wiking	API
@wiking	or api
@wiking	and always link it to latest
@HeikoS	wiking: you reckon?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	I kinda want to keep it simple, and rather hide such things under "developing"
@HeikoS	but ok
@HeikoS	will add it
@wiking	ad it to templates/partials/navbar.html
@wiking	yeah but a doxygen is something you wanna have an easy reference to
@HeikoS	I agree
@wiking	dont want to go via an example
@wiking	to finally find it somewhere
@wiking	linked
@wiking	btw the installation page is a fucking mess :d
@wiking	that should have  TOC
@wiking	to say the least
@wiking	all in all the website is a mess
@wiking	;)
@wiking	that's my impression
@wiking	there's literally no need to that shitty
@wiking	Latest Release
@wiking	part
@wiking	as it's just very awkward
@wiking	and not really useful
@HeikoS	install page
@HeikoS	checking
@wiking	you can link to the latest release
@wiking	on github
@wiking	that's much nicer looking
@wiking	and more informative
@wiking	rather that little <div> with the awkward scrolling
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/releases/latest
@HeikoS	wiking: one thing after another :)
@wiking	it always links to the latest release
@HeikoS	so installation page
@HeikoS	bullet points please
@wiking	i mean best would be to have an auto generated TOC
@wiking	but if it's hard
@wiking	then just add manually a TOC on the top
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	will do
@wiking	ok notebooks are generated
@wiking	the pix are missing
@wiking	as they are not generated yet
@wiking	http://beta.shogun.ml/showroom
@HeikoS	wiking: ok pushed updated install.md with TOC
@HeikoS	good idea!
@HeikoS	wiking: auto-generated toc is a mess so I did a manual one
@HeikoS	think that is fine
@HeikoS	wiking: so about the release thing
@HeikoS	I know its shit
@HeikoS	it is a temporary thing
@HeikoS	I wanted to have the release notes in there
@HeikoS	currently read from RELEASE.md in the docs submodule
@HeikoS	which is not good as needs to be updated by hand before release

@HeikoS	wiking: did you remove tutorial from the buildbot pipeline?
@HeikoS	wiking: i.e. can I remove the folder ?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	\o/ https://www.beatport.com/track/coldwater-feat-steve-graeber-original-mix/8334999
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	wiking: so the tumbs of th enotebooks seem to be generated manually once
@HeikoS	they are not  extracted
@HeikoS	in the website
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	the site just loads the png file
@HeikoS	check
@wiking	the png file needs to be generated somehow
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web2/blob/master/script/gen_notebook_thumbs.py
@HeikoS	so we either need to do this on release
@HeikoS	or the website does it everytime
@wiking	how would the website do it?
@wiking	i mean those pngs need to be extracted when the notebooks are generated
@wiking	imo
@wiking	but we need a script for it
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	that script is no good?
@HeikoS	it just looks for first img
@HeikoS	<img
@wiking	which script?
@HeikoS	i just posted above
@wiking	ah this shit https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web2/blob/master/script/gen_notebook_thumbs.py
@HeikoS	gen_notebook_thumbs
@HeikoS	y
@wiking	where is it called?
@HeikoS	nowhere
@wiking	...
@wiking	pfff
@HeikoS	I mean in fact
@HeikoS	it must have been called on old website right?
@HeikoS	checking
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	but anyhow we can add this script
@wiking	to the the notebook generator
@HeikoS	you saw this btw
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web/blob/master/parserHTML.py
@wiking	no
@wiking	what's this
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	wiking: parser for news file from old swebsite
@wiking	https://www.facebook.com/hintmag/videos/10157701169985261/\
@wiking	i meant
@wiking	https://www.facebook.com/hintmag/videos/10157701169985261/
@wiking	:)

@HeikoS	Let me know whether I should adjust :)
@HeikoS	it is already deployed
@wiking	doh
@wiking	almost
@HeikoS	wiking: so if I now push to master...what happens?
@wiking	not yet
@wiking	plz
@wiking	ppa is failing
@wiking	everyhing else works
@HeikoS	I wont dont worry
@HeikoS	just asking
@HeikoS	ah so the release build is red
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/release/builds/14
@HeikoS	but in fact all but notebooks and ppa worked
@wiking	notebook failed only on that opencv
@wiking	rest is generated
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	wiking: what about data version btw
@HeikoS	was that updated?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	since all the cookbooks need
@HeikoS	ah ok
