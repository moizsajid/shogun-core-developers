 kislay	hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	kislay:  hey!
@HeikoS	kislay: say do the cloud notebooks work for you?
 kislay	never!
 kislay	never till now
 lambday	HeikoS: hey1
 lambday	HeikoS: sorry I was away
@HeikoS	kislay: I see
@HeikoS	lambday: any ideas why the cloiud notebooks dont work?
 lambday	HeikoS: no man!
 lambday	I actually never checked it
 lambday	or did I... don't remember :/
 kislay	HeikoS, lambday hey, if anyone can give me a review on my PR #2250.
 kislay	on the cpp stuff. It would be helpful.
 lambday	kislay: alright let me have a look if I can help :)
 kislay	lambday, thanks :)

 lambday	kislay: there?
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	lambday, The enum thing that you said. I need to use replace 0 for uint8, 1 for int8...and so on.
 lambday	kislay: I think we have enums for that, no?
 kislay	lambday, I have no idea.
 lambday	kislay: let me help you wiht that
 lambday	just a min
 lambday	kislay: have a look here - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/DataType.h#L46
 lambday	will that work?
 lambday	or do you need exact 0 there?
 kislay	exact 0. It's the way OpenCV wants it!
 lambday	kislay: okay I see. Then may be define an enum somewhere
 lambday	I mean, using 0, 1... things like that is a bit confusing IMO
 lambday	just a suggestion though
 lambday	kislay: but please take care of the multi line thing :)
 kislay	lambday, err... sorry. what is it?
 lambday	kislay: read comments :D
 kislay	lambday, got it. :)
 lambday	kislay: :)
 lambday	kislay: you're not up all night, are you?
 kislay	lambday, no. I woke up at 4 :)

 kislay	lambday, you doing a all-nighty ?
 lambday	kislay: hahaha... that happens? :D
 lambday	kislay: yeah I am no more a homo sapiens
 kislay	lambday, haha. I am getting transformed lately too. slowly slowly..
 lambday	kislay: better late than never :P
 khalednasr	lambday, hey
 lambday	khalednasr: hey man
 lambday	how's it going?
 khalednasr	I tried a few things
 khalednasr	did you mean making the base class look like:
 khalednasr	template <class Info1, class Info2, enum Backend,template<class,Info1, Info2...>class Matrix,class T,Info1 I1, Info2... I2>
 khalednasr	lambday, I tried that but I can't figure out how to specialize it for viennacl matrices
 lambday	khalednasr: variadic templates
 lambday	template <class Info, enum Backend, template<class,class...,Info...> class Matrix, class ST, class.... T>
 lambday	so matrix now works with 1 required template arg (1st one - scalar type)
 lambday	2nd arg is optional.. so zero or more... which would be 0 in case of SGMatrix, and Eigen3 matrix and one for ViennaCL matrix
 khalednasr	lambday, does c++ allow two argument packs for templates?
 lambday	and last one us again nothing for SG, int... for Eigen3, and unsigned int for viennacl
 lambday	khalednasr: what do you mean?
 lambday	khalednasr: I think what I just wrote here would work...
 lambday	this should be the basic struct
 lambday	then later specialize as mentioned above...
 khalednasr	lambday, just a sec, I'll check something
 khalednasr	lambday, if you try something like: template <class..., int...> struct bar {};
 khalednasr	lambday, it won't compile
 khalednasr	lambday, you can't have multiple parameter packs
 lambday	khalednasr: nah... you gotta use it like template <class... T, int... Other> struct bar {};
 lambday	later expand the packs as T... and Other...
 lambday	let me try
 lambday	khalednasr: ah I got your pt
 lambday	yep you're right
 lambday	and in that case its a bummer :/
 khalednasr	yeah that sucks
 lambday	ummm..
 khalednasr	lambday, we could get around the entire problem if we restrict ourselves to only column-major or only row-major viennacl matrices..
 lambday	khalednasr: but that's a bad limitation to have, no? :(
 lambday	khalednasr: may be the only other way to deal with this is to use another separate class altogether
 lambday	that only deals with viennacl sums
 lambday	not sure how ugly would that be
 khalednasr	lambday, if we do that we'd  still have the same problem if we wanted to do matrix multiplication or any other matrix operation
 lambday	khalednasr: yeah that's also true
 lambday	sucks to have duplicates
 khalednasr	lambday,maybe we could have two specializations, one for column major and on for raw major matrices..
 lambday	khalednasr: what is default? row-major or col-major?
 khalednasr	lambday, row major
 lambday	khalednasr: that sounds like a better idea!
 lambday	khalednasr: so could you please try just row major for now and see if it fits?
 khalednasr	lambday, I tried something like:
 khalednasr	template <class T, unsigned int Info>
 khalednasr	using VCLMatrix= viennacl::matrix<T, viennacl::row_major, Info>;
 lambday	so that works?
 khalednasr	lambday, and then VCLMatrix works directly with the specialization
 khalednasr	lambday, just like a vector
 lambday	khalednasr: so it fits, right?
 lambday	only row-major as of now is fine
 khalednasr	lambday, better make it column major, since thats the shogun default
 lambday	khalednasr: eigen3 default also... but my concern is,  we intend to do this because we want viennacl matrices to pass directly do these methods, right? so in that case its less probable that someone would actually any other template except the scalar type and rely on the defaults for the rest
 lambday	khalednasr: what do you think?
 khalednasr	lambday, I see
 lambday	do you think that converting would take time if I pass SGMatrix (col-major) and convert it to vienncl (row-major) ?
 khalednasr	lambday, passing SGMatrix into a viennacl backend method?
 lambday	if performance wise the drawback is less then I guess its okay to have row-major
 lambday	khalednasr: yes
 lambday	khalednasr: we would always have to copy, right?
 khalednasr	lambday, I don't think it would take much time, since you'd already be copying it
 khalednasr	yeah
 lambday	khalednasr: so in that case, I'll vote for default
 khalednasr	lambday, but I need column major matrices for neuralnets :D
 khalednasr	lambday, we could just do both
 lambday	khalednasr: haha I see :D so please go ahead with col-major as of now
 lambday	that you urgently need
 lambday	may be add row-major later?
 khalednasr	it would be pretty much just copy-paste, so it shouldn't be a problem
 lambday	got a bit ugly here.. I thought they would use similar thing for matrices as well - bad design for them :@
 lambday	haha yeah
 lambday	eigen3's design is impressive!
 khalednasr	yeah :)
 lambday	khalednasr: alright so col-major it is
 lambday	in fact I'll also add a few more for vectors... so lets push this a bit before thursday
 lambday	mine is independent of what you're doing so we won't run into any crazy merge conflicts I suppose
 khalednasr	yeah probably
 khalednasr	lambday, so, where should I put this? : template <class T, unsigned int Info> using VCLMatrix= viennacl::matrix<T, viennacl::row_major, Info>;
 lambday	implementation/Sum.h would do, right?
 lambday	that's included in modules/Redux.h
 khalednasr	lambday, well, users of the library would have to use VCLMatrix
 khalednasr	and it would be used in other modules too
 lambday	ah crap
 lambday	may be a Base.h somewhere
 lambday	and include that in Sum.h
 lambday	whereever you feel it should go properly
 khalednasr	yeah I guess
 lambday	so that only using mathematics/linalg.h in our applications it becomes immediately available
 lambday	and within linalg as well
 khalednasr	alright
 lambday	also, if you later do the row-major stuff, its may be better to use different names for both
 lambday	so VCLMatrixRowMajor (ugly ugly ugly)
 lambday	suggest some names :D
 khalednasr	I was gonna suggest that :D
 lambday	we're gonna be the worst people ever while suggesting baby names I tell you :D
 lambday	but its alright
 khalednasr	:D
 lambday	its understandable
 lambday	and clean
 lambday	khalednasr: thanks for catching this stuff, man.. looking forward to see it at work :)
 lambday	one of the main reason why Heiko wanted to have a few more methods added before it makes it to develop

 abinash_panda	thor|home: Yeah. I did some minor experiments with random data.
 abinash_panda	thor|home: I would be completing unit tests
 thor|home	abinash_panda: Did you compare shogun-results to scikit-learn results?
 thor|home	i.e. better/worse?
-!- khalednasr [~k.nasr92@196.221.76.69] has joined #shogun
 abinash_panda	thor|home: No, I have not yet compared them. Let me check now
 thor|home	And I saw you introduced a small memory leak http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20140527-0803.html
 thor|home	I guess it is because you're calling `get_label()` without `SG_UNREF` on the returned label.
 abinash_panda	thor|home: I checked the results. Both of them gave nearly same output except for few cases in which scikit-learn gave a lot of false negatives (and in those shogun gave some false positives).
 thor|home	abinash_panda: Cool.
 abinash_panda	thor|home: I can run proper benchmarkings on larger data sets and would give a detailed report :)
 thor|home	abinash_panda: Do you have "real" datasets to check?
 abinash_panda	thor|home: No. I was hoping that you could provide me some links.
 thor|home	Check this: http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets.html
 thor|home	Maybe yeast is good enough.
 thor|home	./data/multilabel/yeast_test.svm
 thor|home	./data/multilabel/yeast_train.svm
 thor|home	We already have it.
 abinash_panda	Okay. I would use it.
 thor|home	http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html
 thor|home	libsvm is a cool thing.  We can also compare with them.
 abinash_panda	thor|home: So, I am thinking of first completing the unit tests for this class and after that create some benchmarks tests with libSVM and scikit-learn and would post them on my blog.
 thor|home	abinash_panda: Where do I find your blog?
 abinash_panda	thor|home: Its abinashpanda.github.io. Currently, it doesn't have any articles regarding shogun and GSoC but I am planning to write some :)
