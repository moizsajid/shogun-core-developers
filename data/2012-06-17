 blackburn	Ok finally first multitask regressor read
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf621fdf / (14 files in 4 dirs): Updated TaskGroup, added train routines for MultitaskLS regression and fixed some bugs in SLEP ported code - http://git.io/Cb8x1A
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rafe730c / (14 files in 4 dirs): Merged SLEP updates - http://git.io/yJ0Baw
 n4nd0	nice
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'm now porting algo that does SVD each iteration (sic!)
 n4nd0	blackburn: and how is it going?
 blackburn	going ok but SVD!
 blackburn	each iteration!
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	too much cost right?
 blackburn	N^3
 shogun-buildbot_	build #632 of octave_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/632
 blackburn	well the only exciting thing about svd is its robustness
 blackburn	with cond=1 it is very stable
 n4nd0	ok

 blackburn	n4nd0: hey any progress with your bug?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I changed a couple of things and the results improved, but I don't find satisfactory yet
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: but the way, let me ask you something
 n4nd0	general SVM theory :D
 blackburn	I've been waiting for this moment whole my life ;)
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I have seen that in the paper they write
 n4nd0	min_w,\xi 1/2 ||w||^2 + C/n sum_i \xi_i
 n4nd0	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/finley_joachims_08a.pdf
 n4nd0	if you prefer to look at it ^
 blackburn	so the question is C/n?
 n4nd0	page 2, equation 1, near to the end of the first column
 n4nd0	it is 1/n in particular
 blackburn	yes found
 n4nd0	I am not using that currently
 n4nd0	I don't know if it should make a difference
 blackburn	it doesn't make difference - just changes C implicitly
 blackburn	what changes the game is \sum_i C_i \xi_i
 n4nd0	why C_i?
 blackburn	it can be done with differents C's
 n4nd0	one for each example
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	I've never seen that, but it's ok
 blackburn	but while you just play with constant before the sum
 blackburn	I don't think it makes and difference
 blackburn	I think it is easier for they to prove things with 1/n
 n4nd0	I am going to use how liblinear does it internally
 blackburn	n4nd0: does what?
 n4nd0	use 1/n
 blackburn	they do not use 1/n
 blackburn	I am 99% sure they don't
 n4nd0	why?
 blackburn	n4nd0: because finley and joachims introduced that I think :)
 n4nd0	the 1/n
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	standart C-S does not involve 1/n
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	neither W-W svm does
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: liblinears multiclass svm is just kind of gradient descent with cooling
 n4nd0	cooling?
 blackburn	simply they just exclude alphas that zeroed
 blackburn	and work only with subset of alphas
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	ocas does cutting plane btw
 n4nd0	yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, the 1/n is kind of a relegion
@sonney2k	some use it some don't
@sonney2k	n4nd0, rationale is that the \sum_i \xi_i is an upper bound on the training error
@sonney2k	if you divide by n it is the risk aka fraction of misclassified examples
@sonney2k	bringing that on the same scale as the ||w||_2^2 makes some sense
@sonney2k	however, I find it not very intuitive in practice at least:
@sonney2k	C does not scale linearly with n
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw what is up with your pull request? you never answered my comment...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah sorry, since there are still some things that I have to correct, apart from the renaming and re-allocating of the files you told me, I thought it was clear that it was not a definitive version to merge yet
 n4nd0	I don't know if you have heard about my fight against the bugs during this week ...
 n4nd0	I have not really coded anything new this week, I am just testing, debugging, testing, debugging, etc
 n4nd0	:S
 blackburn	sonney2k: mldata is not so cool! I never managed to find some popular datasets here :(
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw, you never answered either my mail on the mailing list about the issue with the modular interface :(
 blackburn	O!
 blackburn	did somebody review puffin444?
 blackburn	I did
 n4nd0	nice
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it does not have to be ready as in everything is 100% - it needs to compile and uricamic/wiking can work with the infrastructure
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so it is really highly needed
@sonney2k	blackburn, what dataset is popular/missing?
@sonney2k	blackburn, mldata just needs more users/uploaders...
 blackburn	sonney2k: today I did not manage to find 'school' dataset
 blackburn	for multitask
@sonney2k	never heard of it
@sonney2k	so upload it then :D
 blackburn	yeah if I had
 blackburn	it
 blackburn	sonney2k: they compare on school dataset in every damned multitask paper
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what I commited and introduced in the pull request compiles and doesn't crash anything
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but I will introduce the changes you told me aobut asap so you can merge
 n4nd0	sonney2k: anyway, I am sorry to ask you again, did you have time to take a look to the mail I sent about the modular interface?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am starting to be happy with my results :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: at least they are similar on average with the ones given by multiclass liblinear not using bias
 n4nd0	blackburn: around?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: that's cool
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think I am going to include the possibility to include bias in LinearSOMachine
 blackburn	regularized bias?
 n4nd0	blackburn: if the results of multiclass SO improved more (as it does with LibLienar) then I will be more or less convinced that the impl. is ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: I was thinking of including bias, not regularization as this moment
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that the way it's done in SO, regularization would be included using the matrix C
 n4nd0	in
 n4nd0	min w'*C*w
 blackburn	n4nd0: is it possible to include bias in that kind of formulation?
 n4nd0	why not?
 blackburn	well how?
 n4nd0	adding one more dimension to w
 n4nd0	and the same for the feature vectors
 n4nd0	the one in w is to be learnt and in the feature vectors fixed to 1
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is regularized bias ;)
 n4nd0	where is the regularization there?
 blackburn	it goes to regularization term
 blackburn	||w||
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	so when you optimize w you try to keep b low too
 n4nd0	agree
 blackburn	it is not bad (Mangasarian, 1992) but it is
 blackburn	just is :D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	is what?
 blackburn	it is regularized I mean :)
 blackburn	actually our dear vojta did that in his fancy svm
 blackburn	GMNP one with Kesler transformation and a lot of other stuff
 blackburn	n4nd0: haven't you been watching por-ned?
 n4nd0	blackburn: they showed germany-denmark here, not por-ned
 blackburn	too bad
 blackburn	ronaldo was fscking awesome
 n4nd0	he's fucking awesome :)
 blackburn	portugal has very strong sprinter skills I am amazed with
 blackburn	I bet they do these 50-60 meters in 6-7 seconds
 n4nd0	Greece-Germany in quarter finals
 n4nd0	funny fact :D
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	Russia-Germany would be funnier
 n4nd0	no way
 blackburn	22th June
 blackburn	the day war began
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	Greece - Germany with everything about the economic problems, seems fair enough to me
 blackburn	heh well war is more important I believe :D
 blackburn	22th June, 1941
 n4nd0	aren't we talking about an old war dude?
 n4nd0	some time has passed ever since
 blackburn	very important still for russia and germany too I think
 blackburn	in the end we have lost ~20M
 blackburn	a little less than half of spain :D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	Spain has nothing to do with this ;)
 blackburn	and two swedens
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/wp-content/uploads//2012/06/beard-programmers-final-two.png
 blackburn	did you grow?
 n4nd0	no ... I'm still getting shaved :)
 blackburn	now I do understand why I have not so outstanding skills
 n4nd0	Captain Soeren was at Guru level in this moment http://videolectures.net/icml08_sonnenburg_ipsvm/ :D
 blackburn	yeah right
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	why do he call himself Kristian :D
 n4nd0	who?
 blackburn	joke
 blackburn	in that video he is talking on behalf of some Kristian
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	aha :)
 n4nd0	good night!
