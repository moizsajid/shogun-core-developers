@HeikoS	wiking: all of us are excited about the ppa
@HeikoS	wiking: btw if you do let me know early, you can stay in my place for a couple of days (if I dont have anyone else around)
@wiking	heheh cool
@wiking	yeah i'm excited as well
@wiking	but i've wasted a good amount of time trying to do it with different tools
@wiking	when on the end it came down that actually ppa doesn't allow u to upload your own packages
@wiking	:S
@wiking	so i guess we'll do our own repo for debian
@wiking	but for ppa i need to do a completely different approach
