 lambday	lisitsyn: hey
 lambday	lisitsyn: good morning
 lisitsyn	lambday: hey
 lambday	lisitsyn: one question - if a PR is not merged yet, can't I send another PR with a different commit? I want to create two separate PRs with those
 lisitsyn	lambday: yes from different branches

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hi there, I am sorry for disappearing - I had a really tough preparation for my bachelor stuff (I did not expect myself that it would eat so much time). But now I am finally free) Did somebody already implement neural networks for shogun?)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: why sorry, just take your time, you are not on duty :)
-!- stepan_ [4d4b4af8@gateway/web/freenode/ip.77.75.74.248] has joined #shogun
 stepan_	Hi, I wrote simple test using shogun::CGMM, here http://pastebin.com/pzAG4XEp. Running this program with valgrind reports errors http://pastebin.com/mHZpJD93. There are some definitely lost bytes. Could you please advice me where the bug is?
 lambday	stepan_: its probably because you are SG_UNREF-ing features
 stepan_	lambday: ok, I will test it without SG_UNREF, and let you know
 stepan_	lambday: run it withou SG_UNREF and still definitely lost bytes errors
 lambday	stepan_: nono.. try this.. don't create features with "new", or, create both gm and features by new
 stepan_	lambday: ok, I will try it...
 lambday	then SG_REF gm, and then when you're done with it, do SG_UNREF(gm)
 lambday	(I am not so sure though :( )
 lambday	stepan_: you can try "gist" for pasting codes and results :)
 stepan_	othanks for info, I tried first version without the "new" for features and the report is here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5830272. No lost bytes but sigseg. So I will try the second advice...
 stepan_	creating "new" gm, code and report here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5830320. Still errors
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: so what's up, are you done with your bachelors?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: well, at least I could warn you beforehand, but I really wasn't aware that I would be so busy)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes, I finally has my diploma:)
 lambday	stepan_: checking..
 stepan_	lambday: thanks
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: ahh congrats then!
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: speaking about neural networks: this is what I have in mind right now: http://www.codeuml.com/?635074069489821901 . I'll start with implementing FeedforwardNetwork and BackpropagationTrainer for it. What do you think?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: it is on the very abstract level, without any details
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: I admit I don't know what is the best approach here as I never designed NNs
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: well, I did take a look at some libraries as sonney suggested. Some of them do not use inheritance at all, some do:) Its actually quite a difficult problem, since NN's architecture are really different, and its hard to find something general in all types of NNs:)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: I think we should try to implement DBN
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: dynamic bayesian networks?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: or deep belief networks?)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes, deep belief network
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: that's quite an ambitious goal:) But anyway, DBF are layered networks, so starting with feedforward nets seems reasonable
 lambday	stepan_: can you try adding SG_REF(features) as well? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5830320#file-gistfile1-cpp-L50 ??
 stepan_	lambday: yes I done it and still leaks...
 lambday	stepan_: :( sorry man! can't figure it out :( lisitsyn could you please take a look?
 stepan_	lambday: thats ok, thanks for help anyway
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: then I will start with feedforward nets, if you do not mind. After that, we can try to slowly move towards DBNs. The main architectural question I have to you (and other main contributors), is about training: either I should use 'Trainer's classes, as in the diagram I provided, or just make a method 'train' in the network class (and add some paramater to it, called 'TrainingType' or something).
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I prefer the 'Trainer's class approach, but some popular NN's libraries use the second one as well..
 lisitsyn	lambday: sorry I didn't following
 lisitsyn	what's up?
 lambday	lisitsyn:  so stepan_ has this code which leaks
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: I don't mind any approach as I don't understand how to design them properly :)
 stepan_	lisitsyn: Hi, I wrote simple test using shogun::CGMM, here http://pastebin.com/pzAG4XEp. Running this program with valgrind reports errors http://pastebin.com/mHZpJD93. There are some definitely lost bytes. Could you please advice me where the bug is?
 stepan_	and after seome consulatation https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5830320#file-gistfile1-cpp-L50
 lisitsyn	stepan_: the second leak is missed SG_UNREF(knn) I guess
 lisitsyn	in GMM
 lisitsyn	stepan_: the first leak is bug in CGaussian
 lisitsyn	stepan_: so no bug in your code
 stepan_	lisitsyn: aha so it's bug in library?
 stepan_	strange, I was trying mlpack GMM as well, and also found some bugs in library...
 stepan_	is GMM some obscure method?
 stepan_	I don't understadn machine learning, just implementing GMM
 lisitsyn	stepan_: obscure? what do you mean by that?
 stepan_	lisitsyn: that it's not used often, some other approach is preferable so proper implementations are lacking
 lisitsyn	stepan_: ahh no, I wouldn't say so
 lisitsyn	stepan_: well it scales bad
 lisitsyn	but is indeed better than simple k-means
 stepan_	ok. Thanks all of you for helping me with shogun. It's pitty I can not use it for GMM

 lambday	anyone got his welcome package? just curious :-/
 pickle27	mine arrived!
 van51	lambday: I got it this morning
 lambday	pickle27: van51 awesome! mine didn't :(
 lambday	votjakovr: yours?
 van51	lambday: be patient :)
 pickle27	I'm sure it will show up soon
 lambday	van51: pickle27 yes :)
 van51	I was looking forward to the t-shirt
 van51	but they told me you get that at the end :(
 lambday	van51: me too
 lambday	van51: oh!
 lisitsyn	heh yes t-shirt arrives later
 pickle27	me too damn!
 van51	pity
 lambday	end means after end term?
 pickle27	I was actually just at mountain view and hit up the google store
 lambday	pickle27: you bought some stuffs there?
 lambday	ah, moutain view :D
 lambday	hey there is this movie coming, "internship".. trailer looks funny
 pickle27	yeah I haven't seen it yet
 pickle27	looks like it might be kinda funny
 lambday	pickle27: its not released yet I guess.. the "wedding crashers" group again, huh :D
 pickle27	lambday: yeah I bought a google shirt
 lambday	pickle27: great, man!
 lambday	(y)
 pickle27	they had some pretty sweet stuff in the store
 pickle27	you need to be with an employee to be allowed in
 lambday	gotta be
 lambday	how was your interview? I've read that you had one
 pickle27	lambday: it was okay, I was interviewing for the montreal office and it wasn't as cool as mountain view :(
 pickle27	I actually accepted one of my other offers yesterday
 pickle27	so no Google for me ... yet
 lambday	pickle27: nothing is :(
 lisitsyn	pickle27: what is bad about montreal office?
 lambday	pickle27: congratulations, man! :)
 pickle27	lambday: thanks!
 pickle27	lisitsyn: it was just smaller and most of the people were older and quieter
 pickle27	mountainview had a lot more life
 lambday	lol
 lambday	quiter is bad, really really bad :D
 lambday	quieter*
 pickle27	lambday: where are you at with school?
 lisitsyn	well I wish there was less life in some of my co-workers
 pickle27	lisitsyn: haha!
 lambday	pickle27: I'm from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India
 pickle27	lambday: very cool!
 lambday	lisitsyn: get married :P
 pickle27	lambday: I got to visit India earlier this yeah
 pickle27	year*
 lambday	pickle27: cool, man! where did you visit?
 pickle27	I was in the north though, went to IIT Kanpur and BITS Pilani
 lisitsyn	lambday: btw about marriage, is that true about that recent law in india?
 lambday	lisitsyn: what law?
 lisitsyn	like if you do the right things with a girl you are considered married
 lambday	if you have sex, you'll be considered as married?
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	yes-yes
 lambday	lol
 pickle27	then I went on a bit of a tourist tour and saw Jaipur, Delhi and Agra
 lisitsyn	that's crazy funny
 lambday	lisitsyn: no frickin' idea! these guys are freaks!
 lambday	pickle27: awesome!!! delhi is like my 2nd home :D
 pickle27	neat
 lisitsyn	lambday: our guys recently wanted to restrict oral sex
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	lisitsyn: fuck!! no :(
 pickle27	lambday: so are you still in undergraduate or a masters?
 lambday	pickle27: masters... will be graduating next year
 pickle27	nice!
 lambday	pickle27: you too final year, right?
 pickle27	I'm just finishing my masters
 pickle27	yeah!
 lambday	pickle27: great! I can't wait to get out of the campus!
 lambday	will be sitting for job placement this year, in Dec.. wish me luck :)
 pickle27	lambday: yeah its getting that way for me too
 pickle27	will do!
 lisitsyn	I am quite tired of dormitories too :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: hehehe :D you should really consider about the marriage stuff then :P
 lisitsyn	lambday: why that?
 lambday	don't have to stay in dormitories :D
 lisitsyn	well we are together with my gf for a few years like 5 already but still why :D
 lisitsyn	I don't have to stay here
 lisitsyn	I just save some money
 lambday	lisitsyn: hahaha! that's superb :D
 lisitsyn	because it is of much more cost to rent a flat
 lisitsyn	like 500$/month
 lambday	oh crap!
 lisitsyn	here I pay like
 lisitsyn	40-50$ may be
 lisitsyn	I don't remember
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	hahaha :D great
 lambday	I have to pay $500 per semester for food+hostel+insti fees.. :(
 lisitsyn	I don't know about rates is that a lot for you?
 lisitsyn	I mean gsoc stipend for pickle27 costs much less than for you I guess :)
 lisitsyn	wrong word, not costs - offers
 pickle27	yeah I mean the stipend is quite a lot here but I imagine it would go further in other parts of the world
 lambday	well, I earn $300 a month, so.. yea that's a lot :(
 pickle27	did you mean for a smile at the end there?
 lambday	pickle27: I meant the fees :D about gsoc, yayyy :D
 pickle27	ah gotcha
 lisitsyn	one reason I decided not to participate in this year's gsoc as student is that I earn more at job now
 lambday	lisitsyn: hehe good for us :D
 pickle27	could you have participated? I thought you were done with school
 lisitsyn	pickle27: you are older ;)
 lambday	lisitsyn: how old are you? :-o
 pickle27	lisitsyn: really? neat
 lisitsyn	lambday: 22
 lambday	lisitsyn: LOL =)
 lambday	you old man!
 lambday	:P
 lisitsyn	lambday: you are of the same year or?
 pickle27	omg did you guys try the new github ui?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I don't get that, they changed everything again :D
 lambday	pickle27: I tried and not a day passes that I don't regret it
 pickle27	I just clicked to try I hope I dont regret
 lambday	lisitsyn: I'm 26, sadly
 lisitsyn	lambday: ahh :D
 pickle27	age is but a state of mind
 lambday	true that ;)
 lisitsyn	heh didn't know
 lisitsyn	pickle27: is that you are now 27 and later 28? ;)
 lambday	you couldn't possibly be 22 :-/ you said you're final years masters
 lisitsyn	lambday: not final
 lisitsyn	first year
 lambday	prefinal
 lisitsyn	I finished high school when I was 17 (like everybody does here)
 lisitsyn	4 years of bachelors
 lisitsyn	lambday: where is the error? ;)
 lambday	lisitsyn: hmm... sounds legit
 lambday	I finished when I was 18, took 2 years break from studies, bachelors 4 years, 2 years in masters :-/
 pickle27	lisitsyn: no I am 24
 lisitsyn	pickle27: right between me and lambday
 pickle27	indeed
 lambday	and Heiko?
 lisitsyn	lambday: he is slightly older than you iirc
 lambday	hmmmm..
 pickle27	do either of you know R?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: tried to learn it but you know
 lambday	nope! :(
 pickle27	dang
 pickle27	there is this one line in jdiag that I don't understand and google is not being helpful :(
 pickle27	ctot.prov <- ctot
 pickle27	I don't know what .prov is doing
 lisitsyn	pickle27: sounds very martian
