 pluskid	a big tragedy installing 64bit system: I failed to backup my files, so lost many data, especially my various config files...
 pluskid	spend a big amount of time to re-configure all those
 pluskid	so a lightweighted SGVector and a heavy-weighted SGIVector?

 wiking	:(
 wiking	time to debug then

 n4nd0	hey!!
 n4nd0	I survived to my two exams during the last days, it feels good to be around here :)
 wiking	n4nd0: congrats hope u have passed them as well ;)
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@111.120.59.27] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 n4nd0	wiking: we'll see, I am more or less confident of passing one of them but I am doubtful about the other :S
 blackburn	n4nd0: how many to go?
 n4nd0	blackburn: one on the 7th for the moment
 blackburn	great
 n4nd0	yeah, these two last days were the tough ones
 n4nd0	I am happy they are over
 blackburn	yeah you should have accomplished mood :)
-!- emrecelikten is now known as emre-away
 wiking	blackburn: well yeah this crossval part is totally bogus...
 wiking	crashing like nothing
 blackburn	wiking: huh
 blackburn	wiking: you should contact heiko about it ;)
 wiking	well it either crashes my whole jvm or stops with a simple assertion error
 wiking	but there's no way i can make it work
 wiking	so i'll use gdb now :)
 wiking	"The Chair of cvpr-mcv has requested to publish Paper 23 Title: Multiple Kernel Learning Based Modality Classification for Medical Images to arXiv. Please log into CMT Author's Console to accept or decline this request."
 wiking	CVPR!!!!!!!
 wiking	\o/
 blackburn	wiking: congrats
 wiking	FUCKING HELL
 blackburn	wiking: did you get good results with MKL?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	paper is rejected though
 wiking	only on arXiv
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	strange
 wiking	fuckin ghell
 wiking	2 accepted the paper
 wiking	one rejected
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	wiking: editors?
 wiking	reviewers
 blackburn	same was for my jmlr mloss paper..
 blackburn	yes sorry reviewers
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know which concerns pluskid has?
 blackburn	sonney2k: with?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do you have any opinion on the new SGVector design
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess SGVector...
 blackburn	oh I planned to install opensuse right now
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ok lets discuss it again
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't ask him actually :(
 n4nd0	sonney2k: probably I am not up to date with the very last discussion (I have not read logs from yesterday)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you use debian unstable with gnome 3?
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: gsomix: lets discuss it right now?
 n4nd0	sure! I am updating to last conversations right now
* gsomix sits and listens to elders. :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: so what is the main advantage of using SGVector and SGIVector?
 blackburn	n4nd0: if I knew
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	is it to have something rather light-weighted for simple datatypes like int and double?
 blackburn	n4nd0: it looks like we are probably unhappy with current memory handling
 n4nd0	I like the idea of being able to make vectors of anything
 blackburn	no we don't need vectors of anything
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.247.30] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	e.g. instead of CMachine* -> vector< CMachine >
 blackburn	no no SGVector is only for numeric stuff
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	but the other one, SGIVector would be for the rest right?
 blackburn	no, it is for vectors those are shared between different objects
 blackburn	so it has refcounting
 wiking	HEEELP
 blackburn	wiking: you need somebody?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	"As of now, your paper is a weak rejection (the only paper with conflict reviews). However, if you think you can address the negative issues being raised by reviewer. I can give you a rebuttal chance."
 wiking	I NEED HEEELP!
 blackburn	not just anybody?
 blackburn	:D
 gsomix	blackburn, too beatle.
 blackburn	wiking: I'd be happy to help to improve it
@sonney2k	wiking, sounds good
 wiking	sonney2k: HEEELP!!!
 blackburn	heh my help is probably not needed :D
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no
 wiking	blackburn: anybody's good
 wiking	but sonney2k is experienced in this matter afaik
 blackburn	wiking: sure
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is all only for numerical stuff ... let me repeat what I've said somewhen yesterday
@sonney2k	n4nd0, SGVector would be just the double* ptr and int for length
@sonney2k	nothing more -> no overhead
@sonney2k	will only be used if the vector is just to be used in this function and no more
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	not in member variables not for interface exchange stuff
 gsomix	sonney2k, what is strategy to ref counting in SGIVector?
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.247.30] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	okay I am totally lost why do we need it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, SGIVector wold be the one with ref counting
@sonney2k	that's it
@sonney2k	gsomix, like with SGVector
@sonney2k	gsomix, err SGObject
 n4nd0	ok
 gsomix	sonney2k, mmm, and I'm asking again. do we plan to work with pointers to SGIVector?
@sonney2k	gsomix, no
 gsomix	sonney2k, copies?
 wiking	blackburn: sent
 blackburn	wiking: got desperated? :D
 wiking	blackburn: well i'm appreciating anybody's help!
@sonney2k	yes - but I just realize that this then would need some different solution for refcounts
@sonney2k	(due to copies)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes count should be stored somewhere
 gsomix	sonney2k, like pluskid solution?
@sonney2k	gsomix, but w/o the hack
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@npasserelle10.minet.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, so e.g. allocate some memory for the refcount (so have a int32_t* in SGIVector pointing to the counter - this ptr is shared between SGIVectors and memory freed if *ptr == 0)
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha. It's clear for me.
 n4nd0	what would be the relation between SGVector and SGIVector?
 n4nd0	I see there should be inheritance there but I think I am still missing something
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just inheritance to not write the code that is in SGVector twice
 n4nd0	ok so SGVector <--- SGIVector
@sonney2k	or other way round :)
 n4nd0	??
 n4nd0	how can it be that it does not matter?
@sonney2k	?
 n4nd0	the idea is to have the T* and the int for the length in SGVector
 n4nd0	in SGIVector add the ref counting stuff
 n4nd0	SGIVector inheiths fom SGVector
 n4nd0	is that right?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, exactly like that
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so any thoughts / comments?
@sonney2k	wiking, I still don't understand what you need? don't you have a couple of senior authors?
 wiking	sonney2k: hahahah i wish i would
@sonney2k	wiking, sole author or what?
 wiking	yep
@sonney2k	wtf?
 wiking	well when shit happens...
@sonney2k	are you crazy?
 wiking	no
 wiking	it's not me who is crazy
 wiking	imho
@sonney2k	ok
 wiking	or? :)
 wiking	i mean yes it is fucking crazy that i'm doing this alone
 wiking	but this is the truth
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, so that we said is the how to do it, but why do we want to do it? I just come up to reduce some memory usage. SGVector would occupy less than SGIVector
@sonney2k	I think I don't know any phd student who publishes w/o a senior author
 wiking	sonney2k: yep, i know but since my supervisors are basically not existing... what can i do?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll do it solely too probably if I do my phd here
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	wiking: do you have only virtual supervisor?
 wiking	blackburn: actually 2 of them!
 blackburn	2 virtuals?
 blackburn	lol
 wiking	yes
 wiking	neither of them does anything
 n4nd0	blackburn: you should go outside for your PhD and discover new world!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, exactly that is the reason - SGVector has a lot less overhead, so for example when using 2d byte vectors you will not have the overhead memory and copy wise
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for example if you compute kernel matrix and get ptr's to feature vectors you don't need the ref/unref
@sonney2k	which would make everything twice as costly
@sonney2k	wiking, I always had virtual and real supervisors
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	the real one is the GUN part of shogun :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I must check how this ref counting is done in SGObject to understand better that there is a real overhead
 wiking	sonney2k: in my case they are having virtual String review (String paper) =0;
 wiking	;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you need the refcount and you need to in/decref it and do a check whether to free the vector
@sonney2k	wiking, I guess none of the papers I wrote when I started would have been accepted w/o help from 'senior' authors
 wiking	sonney2k: i have 2 accepted now 2 months ago
 wiking	both of them written like this one :>
@sonney2k	which conf?
 wiking	pakdd
 wiking	and the other is a minor one
@sonney2k	pakdd == kdd?
 wiking	nono it's the pacific-asia kdd
@sonney2k	if not I don't know this one...
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	wiking, it gets exponentially harder with confs like kdd/icml/nips
 wiking	so it's not as big as kdd but it's ok
 wiking	sonney2k: i know
 wiking	sonney2k: this one where i've got 2 vs 1 was cvpr
@sonney2k	cvpr is top tier or?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	but it's just a workshop
 wiking	not the conference
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	ok
 wiking	but then again it gets indexed the same way as cvpr :PP
 wiking	but yes as u said i'm very afraid that i won't be able to get any paper accepted like this on a better conference... and then i'm basically fucked with my whole phd ;P
 wiking	sonney2k: but now that u've told me this it's just reassured me that it won't work out :D yeeeey \o/

@sonney2k	wiking, don't get me wrong but there are always virtual supervisors but you need to find real ones to have fun / a chance to compete

 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I meant the same
 blackburn	wiking: was my comments any useful?
 blackburn	were*
 wiking	yeah of course!
 wiking	i'm now collecting comments and thinking of how it could be done better
 wiking	and i'll give it a go
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 wiking	worst case they reject it for sure :)
 blackburn	again, I think you should stress the fact you work with features of different nature
 wiking	i guess i have to lament about it more :)
 blackburn	wiking: I really had the same problem with my paper about road signs recognition
 blackburn	they are pretty similar actually
 blackburn	homogay map again
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	and no strong evidence of novelty :(
 wiking	hehehehehe
 wiking	weeee SUCK
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	however my paper goes to very low level *russian* journal
 blackburn	its goal is to strength up my bachelors work and nothing more :D
 wiking	heheh yeah that's another story
 wiking	i'm in a different position :S
 blackburn	wiking: how long have you been as phd students?
 blackburn	student*
 wiking	1.5
 wiking	year
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	were you at industry before?
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	why did you leave it btw?
 wiking	mmmm was very boring
 blackburn	I'm leaving my kind of industry job in may
 wiking	i've tried several places
 wiking	the problem is that it is great... for the first couple of months
 wiking	and then it's becoming more and more dull
 wiking	so i felt like becoming brain damaged... and there was a too much of a politics involved...
 wiking	politics = management ...
 blackburn	wiking: yeah I had one example of overmanagement recently
 blackburn	it took a week to fix one line
 blackburn	exactly one line
 wiking	with phd it's great that you are more independent... but the shit part is that is my case when u are completely independent
 blackburn	findById instead of findByPrimaryKey
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	heheh yeah i know how that feels
 wiking	i mean when i started to write code generator for my tasks at the work
 blackburn	wiking: yeah it shouldn't be like that..
 wiking	i've realized that i have to quite
 wiking	quit
 blackburn	lol
 wiking	i mean there was not much brain involved in the stories
 wiking	more like hard core coding
 blackburn	my problem is that I do not code at all
 blackburn	I have to fix some sql or some code but not to code something new
 blackburn	there is nothing to do left
