@wiking	lisitsyn, ping	15:22
lisitsyn	wiking: pooooong	15:22
@wiking	ok so	15:23
@wiking	i'm thinking about creating a small helper library	15:23
@wiking	to represent pipelines	15:23
@wiking	where you can easily represent inputs and outputs and operations over them	15:23
@wiking	this could be a wrapper around the modularised shogun	15:24
@wiking	catching my drift?	15:24
CaBa	heya wiking	15:24
@wiking	CaBa, y0	15:24
@wiking	i've been talking with a friend and he reckons the best would be to actually represent these operations among the operators	15:25
@wiking	as a stack	15:25
@wiking	where you push and pop things	15:25
@wiking	btw later on this could be generated into a computational graph (if we could actually distribute the thing)	15:25

lisitsyn	wiking: yes	16:56
lisitsyn	graph sounds better tho	16:57
lisitsyn	but stack is so easier to have in code	16:57
@wiking	graph is messy to maintain the code	16:58
@wiking	and actually representing things on a stack	16:58
@wiking	is easy in a yaml	16:58
@wiking	just a simple line	16:58

nagdev	Hi everyone, I'm Devesh. I'm currently in my Junior Year pursuing Engineering. I've been working with machine learning algorithms for about a year now. I'm fairly acquainted with most of the basic programming languages in the field (C++, Python, R, MATLAB). I would like to contribute in the development of shogun toolbox.	22:05
nagdev	I've read most of the documentation for beginners on the GitHub wiki. So far, I have successfully installed the toolbox and tried out some basic functionalities (K-Means algo from the showroom). I also went through the project list and figured out the projects I might be useful in. I was wondering how to proceed from this point. Can someone please guide me?	22:05
