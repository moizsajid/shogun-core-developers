@wiking	lisitsyn, ping
 lisitsyn	wiking: pooooong
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	i'm thinking about creating a small helper library
@wiking	to represent pipelines
@wiking	where you can easily represent inputs and outputs and operations over them
@wiking	this could be a wrapper around the modularised shogun
@wiking	catching my drift?
 CaBa	heya wiking
@wiking	CaBa, y0
@wiking	i've been talking with a friend and he reckons the best would be to actually represent these operations among the operators
@wiking	as a stack
@wiking	where you push and pop things
@wiking	btw later on this could be generated into a computational graph (if we could actually distribute the thing)

 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 lisitsyn	graph sounds better tho
 lisitsyn	but stack is so easier to have in code
@wiking	graph is messy to maintain the code
@wiking	and actually representing things on a stack
@wiking	is easy in a yaml
@wiking	just a simple line

 nagdev	Hi everyone, I'm Devesh. I'm currently in my Junior Year pursuing Engineering. I've been working with machine learning algorithms for about a year now. I'm fairly acquainted with most of the basic programming languages in the field (C++, Python, R, MATLAB). I would like to contribute in the development of shogun toolbox.
 nagdev	 I've read most of the documentation for beginners on the GitHub wiki. So far, I have successfully installed the toolbox and tried out some basic functionalities (K-Means algo from the showroom). I also went through the project list and figured out the projects I might be useful in. I was wondering how to proceed from this point. Can someone please guide me?
