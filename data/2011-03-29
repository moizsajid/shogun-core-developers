 sploving	hello sonney2k
 sonney2k	sploving, good morning
 sploving	good morning. I find that jblas do not support sparse matrix
 sonney2k	sploving, not many packages do - not even R has support for sparse matrices
 sploving	okay. then we should not write these typemaps
 sonney2k	sploving, let me check - I recall that there is one big java matrix package around
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@46.18.27.35] has joined #shogun
 sploving	http://jblas.org/javadoc/index.html
 sonney2k	that one probably http://www.ujmp.org/
 sonney2k	it can indeed do sparse matrices http://www.ujmp.org/apidocs/ujmp-core/apidocs/
 sploving	this lib is maturate?
 sploving	I have never heard that
 sploving	it indeed
 sonney2k	sploving, I think it is very mature
 sploving	ok. sonney2k, another question, I took at the typemap.i in the python_modular and know what thatis meaning. But I do not understand the two interface file in pyton dir. "pythoninterface.h" "pythoninterface.cpp"
 sploving	what are they for?
 sploving	are they equal the wrapper file that swig generate?
 sonney2k	sploving, sorry where are these files?
 sonney2k	$ ls python_modular/
 sonney2k	sg_print_functions.cpp  swig_typemaps.i
 sonney2k	is all I have there
 sploving	$ls python/
 sonney2k	you will only need to modify swig_typemaps.i
 sonney2k	sploving, ahh I understand. That is the legacy static interface
 sonney2k	let me explain
 sonney2k	shogun has two kinds of interfaces: static ones (do not require swig) and modular ones (require swig)
 sploving	this i know.
 sploving	what is the difference?
 sonney2k	the static ones are in the directories octave, r, python, matlab ...
 sonney2k	modular swig based ones in the *_modular
 sploving	the static interface files equal the wrapper file that swig generate?
 sonney2k	the difference is that for static ones one has to write interfaces / for swig they are automatically created *AND* maybe more important the static ones are not object oriented and have interfaces for only a very limit amount of functions
 sonney2k	Did I make myself clear?
 sploving	okay. swig could also generated static wrapper file
 sonney2k	sploving, well no...
 sonney2k	swig exports all of shoguns classes directly into python etc
 sonney2k	so we have e.g. CClassifier -> Classifier in python
 sonney2k	the static interfaces have just some 'sg' command that takes a few options e.g. sg('new_classifier', 'LibSVM')
 sonney2k	so totally different
 sploving	i took at the examples. and clear now. then I also need write the static java file?
 sonney2k	sploving, no
 sonney2k	only java_modular interface
 sploving	i am glad to hear that. but why not support static?
 sonney2k	sploving, because functionality is very limited in static anyways
 sploving	i know~
 sonney2k	so I expect new users to only ever use a modular interface
 sploving	then for jave support, i need write typemap.i for ujmp.
 sonney2k	sploving, btw, I am just now modifying the configure script etc to enable swig for lua, ruby, java - such that you can get started much easier then
 sonney2k	swig_typemaps.i yes - I think you should start writing wrappers for jblas first and then maybe later for ujmp ... simply because mikio braun can mentor how this works (he is the author of jblas) and also a mentor for this
 sploving	sonney2k, i know. thx.

 sploving	as there are 12 weeks, what do you think better.  java coding ->java test,doc; lua coding->lua test,doc; or java coding, lua coding->java test,doc, lua test doc
 sploving	i just need write the proposal plan. although they are not difficult to implement
-!- dvevre [b49531e3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.227] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 sonney2k	sploving, I don't think it will take you that much time but I guess it is better to finish one before attempting the other.
 sonney2k	I guess you will easily be able to also do ruby_modular but I am fine with it not being mentioned in the proposal
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@46.18.27.35] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 sploving	ruby never used:(
 sploving	overestimate me :)
 sonney2k	sploving, doesn't matter ... you know enough languages already to easily read that code
 sonney2k	the difficulty lies only in getting the typemaps to work, not the language - see http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/
 sploving	then are you familiar with one matrix lib?
 sploving	if support ruby which lib we use?
 sonney2k	sploving, http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/ the matrix package I think.

 sonney2k	sploving, hmmhh it is actullay not totally straight forward to even get the basic swig thingies to compile
 sonney2k	sploving, I will try a few more hours but then I guess you have to take over...
 sonney2k	there are things happening like: java package names cannot have the same name like a class in the package
 sonney2k	etc
 sonney2k	sploving, it seems like only lua works out of the box
 sploving	sonney2k, you mean lua works well
 sonney2k	lua at least compiles
 sploving	could we use %rename java?
 sonney2k	sploving, yes but it is somehow stupid - I mean in all languages it is named differntly? stupid!
 sonney2k	but yes, for now I will rename Classifier -> ClassifierBase etc
-!- siddharth [~siddharth@117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun

 sonney2k	sploving, regarding lua
 sonney2k	what how are binary extension named?
 sonney2k	I mean do the end with extension.so ?
 sonney2k	and how do I load an extension?
 sploving	yep
 sploving	require ("example")
 sploving	example.so is the binary
 sonney2k	sploving, segfault!
 sonney2k	dammed, this train is crowded with kids calling me a hacker! a hacker *LOL*
 sonney2k	ok so I guess something lua wise is not correct
 sonney2k	but at least it compiles ...
 sploving	sonney2k compiles is a good start.
 sonney2k	sploving, I will commit later today so you can have a look...
 sploving	sonney2k, i am writing the proposal now
 sonney2k	sploving, sure that has priority
 sploving	soney2k, okay

 yin	on the second page of the coffin paper, the last formula I(\Phi(x)_k) should be \Phi(z)??
 sonney2k	yin, ehh could be :)
 yin	:) as x should be the mapped vector and z is the original feature vector.
 sonney2k	true then
 sonney2k	yin, I think I have more papers to be proof red :D
 sonney2k	sploving, java compiles now too...
 sploving	sonney2k, congratulation~ thx for your work
 Tanmoy	@yin...feature map shld be on i/p vectors
 sonney2k	now off to ruby
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@46.18.27.35] has joined #shogun
 sploving	sonney2k, good luck~
 sploving	waiting for good news.
 sploving	sonney2k, the typemaps.i just map the in/out para, where are the *.i files that include all the functions that pytho,etc calls. for example, in pythin example, svm=LibSVM(..), where is the wrapper file for libsvm function
 sonney2k	sploving, in the modular/ dir we have all the *.i files that do the svm=LibSVM() magic etc
 yin	sonney2k, in section 2.1.2 computing \Phi for a variety of kernels. are the three kernels implemented in shogun now?
 sonney2k	the typemaps just do the conversion e.g. numpy matrix -> set_matrix(float64_t* matrix, int dim1, int dim2)
 sploving	that is the interface file for general language
 sonney2k	yin, spectrum / weightedegree, polynomial ? yes
 yin	sonney2k, yes. these three.
 sploving	sonney2k, i know ant take a look at it
-!- skydiver [4deac315@gateway/web/freenode/ip.77.234.195.21] has joined #shogun
 yin	sonney2k, i am reading CFeatures and its children now. These classes should contain all the data structures that hold data samples. Are there any other class outside this family that are relevant to data samples?
 sploving	sonney2k, there are mainly four arrays in python typemap: input output in-place argout. but the octave, r modular just have input argout array.
 sploving	Do r and octave not support output and in-place array?
-!- siddharth [~siddharth@117.211.88.150] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 sonney2k	sploving, within shogun I've never used inplace argout
 sonney2k	yin, no
 yin	sonney2k, thanks:)
 sonney2k	yin, these classes can be pretty big /messy
 sploving	sonney2k, besides the arrays, there are also CTstring feature, What are they for?
 yin	sonney2k, i am diving into the source now.
 yin	hope i can figure some structure out and i will add to my "some design patterns in shogun" report.
 sonney2k	sploving, regarding features we support strings (that is what these are for), sparse matrices and dense matrices
 yin	i think analyzing this part of code is important as we have a project for designing online feature class.
 yin	sonney2k, i also found that CAttributeFeatures and some others are never used by a classifier or clustering algorithm.
 sonney2k	yin, I hope it does not turn into a 'clean up the mess' project ...
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@46.18.27.35] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 sonney2k	yin, yes they are not used. I was only drafting this - but had no time to finish... basically what I wanted is something like in C structs as features
 yin	sonney2k, i see. btw, there is a "feature name" concept for cdotfeatures?
 sonney2k	no
 yin	e.g. the first dimension of feature vector x means the "length", the 2nd dimension means "age"
 yin	ok. but if we add decision trees, this information is better encoded into its feature class.
-!- aifargonos [~aifargono@193.206.186.107] has joined #shogun
 sonney2k	yin, well not really
 sonney2k	it is nice to have I agree
 yin	i've sent a email to the mailing list earlier today about the opencv library
 yin	do you have any comments?
 yin	thanks.
 sonney2k	Yes, I will reply today
 yin	:)
 sonney2k	sploving, OK lua,java,ruby now at least compile with swig interfaces...
 sploving	sonney2k, good news~

 alesis-novik	Hello knrrrd
 hiteshk	alesis-novik , did he reply to your mail

@knrrrd	The official deadline is 8th, right?
 hiteshk	have you subscribed to the mailing list
 alesis-novik	yes knrrrd
 alesis-novik	Not yet hiteshk
@knrrrd	Ah ok. I am looking forward to the applications.
 alesis-novik	If we submit them earlier, will anyone comment on them before the deadline?
@knrrrd	alesis-novik: I am not sure if this would be fair
 alesis-novik	I meant asking to clarify something or similar comments, but either way is fine
 alesis-novik	Just so I know that I can refine it until the last day and then submit
@knrrrd	As far as I know, the mentors will have a discussion on all applications after the deadline

 davidcg	Not sure if anyone is there, but just wanted to point out that SVMLin is behaving strangely.  It generates decent classifiers in very little time, but sometimes it reverses the labels (e.g. generates a classifier with 20% accuracy instead of 80% accuracy).
 sonney2k	davidcg, do you see any pattern in that?
 sonney2k	I mean like the first label is always -1 in such cases?
 davidcg	It happens about 50% of the time, I'd wager it's being assigned randomly.
 davidcg	Hm, not sure if it's dependent on what the first label is.
 sonney2k	davidcg, you could check if liblinear behaves in the same way
 sonney2k	if not then it could be really a bug
 davidcg	It may be due to the first label....
 davidcg	Just checked and if the first label was -1, it would generate the opposite classifier, when I changed only the first label to 1 it produced the correct result.
 siddharth_	hello
 sonney2k	davidcg, heh ... that code looks suspicous:
 sonney2k	    float64_t sgn=train_labels[0];
 sonney2k	    for (int32_t i=0; i<num_feat+1; i++)
 sonney2k	        Weights.vec[i]*=sgn;
 sonney2k	perfectly correlates with your observation
 sonney2k	davidcg, would you mind commenting lines 100-102 in SVMLin.cpp and see if it fixes the problem?
 sonney2k	siddharth_, hi...
 siddharth_	i would like to work on "Implement Olivier Chapelles fast newton based SVM solver"
 davidcg	Haha, yeah, that looks like it would cause it.
 siddharth_	so how should i apply through GSOC?
 davidcg	Btw, using the python modular interface - don't seem to be able to use LibLinear (get a "Sorry, not yet implemented." when attempting to train).
 siddharth_	Btw sonney2k are u Soeren Sonnenburg?
 davidcg	Thanks for the help on SVMLin though - I'm sure that changing those lines will fix it.
 sonney2k	davidcg, so can you confirm it?
 sonney2k	siddharth_, I am about to send out an email with details
 siddharth_	so should i apply after ur email?
 siddharth_	There is one more thing
 siddharth_	i was not able to clearly understand the member function "Calibrate" in SVMSGD
 sonney2k	siddharth_, that is Leon Bottou black magic :)
 davidcg	I'm sorry, don't have the permissions to recompile part of shogun on my server - I've used several other classifiers without seeing this behavior though, and that first line would definitely explain it.
 davidcg	(float64_t sgn=train_labels[0])
 davidcg	Thanks again!

 sonney2k	siddharth_, he simply has a lot of SGD experience
 sonney2k	I think he estimates step sizes for bias and w independently and also has some heuristics how often to update one but not the other
 siddharth_	yes and he using the sparse features
 sonney2k	siddharth_, yes
 siddharth_	sonney2k, for the primal SVM solver project,we have to convert matlab code to c++,in the overloaded train() function
 siddharth_	before jumping to that,can u suggest some SVm code to begin with
 siddharth_	so that I can get a feel of it
 sonney2k	the liblinear in shogun maybe?
 siddharth_	sonney2k, ok i will try them...Also for the proposal do we have to give the timeline or just the project name?
 sonney2k	siddharth_, timeline is better. plan conservatively and maybe add additional projects in some later months/outlook... if you accidentally finish early :)
 siddharth_	sonney2k, thanks...i will keep this in mind...Also i want to ask whether SVMSMO has been implemented in Shogun?
 sonney2k	siddharth_, what is SVMSMO? I mean that sounds like libsvm - no?
 sonney2k	siddharth_, potentially more interesting is a GPU based svm ...
 siddharth_	sonney2k, Support Vector Machines Using Sequential Minimal Optimization
