 nginn	hi guys. I'm currently working on issue #2717 and have some problems with going through the type hierarchy of multiple classes. I'm using Eclipse 3.8 CDT (and Code Analysis tool failes to do it's job properly). Which IDEs / specific options or tools can you suggest from your experience that allow to work easy with the shogun?
 lisitsyn	nginn: hey
 lisitsyn	most of us are a bit hardcore on that
 lisitsyn	like vim emacs :)
 lisitsyn	but well, eclipse should work on that
 nginn	and which plugins for vim do you use? I've used to it myself but usually for smaller projects
 lisitsyn	nginn: clang_complete worked pretty well
 lisitsyn	but YouCompleteMe is better indeed
 nginn	lisitsyn: thanks, I'll try the latter
 lisitsyn	it takes some effort to configure though
 nginn	yes, it is, but I quickly found some guides so as long as there aren't any specific configurations for shogun I think it could be ok)
