 cmnky	does anyone know of optimal / statistical methods to determine how often a MLP network should be retrained ? ( for a forecasting / prediction application )

 n4nd0	sonney2k: around?

 blackburn	wiking: cramer singer would be available today ;)
 wiking	\o/ awweeeeeesooomE!
 blackburn	debugging it currently
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	actually i should think about this cramer-singer multi class svm
 wiking	and how to formulate for latent case
 blackburn	no idea :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey man! how is it going?
 blackburn	n4nd0: fine, what about you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: fine too :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'd like to ask you about the pull request I am working with for the Mahalanobis distance
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't know if you have seen it, soeren has been checking it lately
 blackburn	wasn't it merged?
 n4nd0	blackburn: the thing is that the last comment he wrote, I don't really understand what is the new modification I should add
 blackburn	ok let me check
 n4nd0	blackburn: the first one I did yes, but when I add and example he told me about changing another thing
 n4nd0	ok, thanks
 blackburn	I didn't get the idea too heh
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just make the 'use the mean' thing optional
@sonney2k	so add an explicit option for that
@sonney2k	that's all
@sonney2k	no lhs!=rhs magic for that
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know whether liblinear crammer-singer uses bias?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I think I see what you mean, the possibility of using a feature vector from lhs even rhs != lhs
 n4nd0	even if*

 josh_k	Anyone around?
 blackburn	yeah
 josh_k	Great, is there any documentation describing the technical hurdles that would need to be overcome to get libshogun building natively for 64-bit Windows?
 blackburn	uh..
 blackburn	unfortunately no
 blackburn	well main problem is build system
 blackburn	I guess
 blackburn	we use make and I'm not sure whether it would work natively

 josh_k	I'd be willing to play around with a CMake port of the build system, I was just wondering if there are any library dependencies that would be hard to port over
 blackburn	ok, I don't think there are such mandatory dependencies
 josh_k	Ok cool, I think I'll give it a shot then and see how far I can get :) Thanks!
 blackburn	josh_k: feel free to ask any details using mailing list or irc
