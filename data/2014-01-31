 lambday	wiking: man spark is a beast! checking out local things... will test with a cluster..

@wiking	lambday: hehe managed?
@wiking	lambday: yeah i've checked into it as well
@wiking	lambday: the thing is that sparkR just came out
@wiking	they did a very nice interfacing of java (spark) <-> R
@wiking	so we could learn from that
 lambday	wiking: yeah I was just checking yesterday's logs...
 lambday	wiking: yeah.. trying to set up standalone mode :D
@wiking	have u managed local?
@wiking	with the cores?
 lambday	wiking: you mean setting the same machine as master and worker - just did
 lambday	 IdAddressStateCoresMemory worker-20140131142800-lambday-51008lambday:51008ALIVE4 (0 Used) 2.6 GB (0.0 B Used)
 lambday	wiking: so now I should be able to use that MASTER=IP:PORT pyspark thing, right?
 lambday	checking the docs...
@wiking	y
 lambday	wiking: ran a python example... with this setting.. worked :D
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
@wiking	lambday: yeah spark is quite cool
@wiking	lambday: i think we shoudl try with the jni hack
@wiking	that could work
@wiking	imho
@wiking	sonney2k: ping?
@wiking	lisitsyn: here?
 lisitsyn	wiking: 50%
@wiking	lisitsyn: do we have a @shogun-toolbox.org email that is being forwarded to more than one person? :)
 lambday	wiking: I gotta understand this rdd things..
@wiking	like all the core members or somehting?
@wiking	lambday: it's not so complicated
@wiking	lisitsyn: as 48 hours has gone w/o objections
@wiking	so i'll do now a massive send email to all the contributors
 lisitsyn	wiking: shogun-team@
@wiking	lisitsyn: do u have access to it's admin site?
@wiking	just to be able to see who's answering
@wiking	what emails are actually not working etc.
@wiking	ok email sent
@wiking	brb
 lisitsyn	wiking: afaik no
 lisitsyn	wiking: is that actually ok to declare this 48h thing?
 lisitsyn	sounds like a kidnapper
 lisitsyn	who wants money
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: well we kept it postponing for a while and everybody said already what they wanted
@wiking	and actually nobody ever mentioned that there's a problem with it
@wiking	i.e. nobody was ever against for the change
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah sure I just don't know how this works
@wiking	at least not the core developers
@wiking	of course now we'll find out
@wiking	what the other contributors are saying
@wiking	because that 9 of us had no objections
@wiking	that doesn't mean that nobody has objections
@wiking	so now with this licensing change form we'll see if we would have at least the majority of the code transferred to another licensing
@wiking	so still actually this form is just another 'survey'
@wiking	and doesn't force us to do anything
@wiking	on the end we'll se if we at least have the permission to do this change
@wiking	that doesn't necessary mean that we'll do it
@wiking	*see
 lisitsyn	okay I see
@wiking	and anyways as i suspect
@wiking	this will take a while
@wiking	till we get replies from the people
@wiking	so we might need to wait for like couple of months actually i think

 new2shogun	hello guys, I am new to shogun and have problems getting it to work on a macbook 11-1/OSX 10.9.1 with python_modular. Installing it with macports like described on shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/installation.html leaves me with the following error message: "ImportError: No module named modshogun". Any help is greatly appreciated! I also tried to install from source, but without success.

 thoralf	Heyho.
 new2shogun	when compiling from source I get the following line "clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-I ~/shogun/src'" and before that "[ 86%] Swig source ~/shogun/src/shogun/lib/SGVector.h:57: Warning 503: Can't wrap 'operator long long*' unless renamed to a valid identifier."
 new2shogun	the argument unused appears just after "Building CXX object src/interfaces/python_modular/CMakeFiles/_python_modular.dir/modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx.o"
 lambday	new2shogun: does it harm the building process?
-!- lambday_ [67157e37@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.55] has joined #shogun
 new2shogun	the make ends with an error 2
 new2shogun	ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) make[2]: *** [src/interfaces/python_modular/_modshogun.so] Error 1 make[1]: *** [src/interfaces/python_modular/CMakeFiles/_python_modular.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2
 lambday_	new2shogun: I don't think that's the reason - that's a warning.. not an error
 lambday_	new2shogun: however I don't have osx.. I am trying to build it on linux and check if I can reproduce it

 lambday	new2shogun: could you please paste your cmake output somewhere?
 new2shogun	just a moment...
 new2shogun	its here: http://n.ethz.ch/~eglif/download/cmake_log.txt
 new2shogun	when I run cmake without the python modular option, the compilation works fine, AFAICT. -> http://n.ethz.ch/~eglif/download/shogun_cmake_make_log.txt
 lambday	new2shogun: sorry man! works fine for linux but I see some failed builds on the buildbots..
 lambday	wiking: sonney2k
 lambday	cmake seems to be fine.. where *does* it fail exactly?
 new2shogun	which brand of linux? what requirement? I could try a virtual machine...
 lambday	new2shogun: I am using fedora core19... you can as well try ubuntu...
 lambday	building eats up a lot of memory... your virtual machine should have enough then :)
 new2shogun	here is the cmake-make terminal output with python modular option which fails me: http://n.ethz.ch/~eglif/download/shogun_cmake_make_python_modular_log.txt
 lambday	new2shogun: checking..
 new2shogun	should work with 8GB assigned to it. no?
 lambday	shit! all errors are related to complex<double> :D
 lambday	new2shogun: yeah :)
 new2shogun	is there a cure for complex doubles?
 lambday	new2shogun: I never ran into this problem... wonder whether you can try with g++ instead of clang
 lambday	it must has to do something with standard library :-/
 new2shogun	i can try g++
 new2shogun	should I also change the c-compiler at the same try
 new2shogun	should I also change the c-compiler at the same try?
 lambday	new2shogun: before that, could you please tell where your libstdc++.so is located at?
 lambday	new2shogun: (I am also shooting in the dark here, as you might have already guessed! :P)
 new2shogun	i have the following files in /usr/lib: libstdc++.6.0.9.dylib  libstdc++.6.dylib      libstdc++.dylib
 lambday	huh
 new2shogun	as well as /opt/local/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib
 lambday	so there is no /usr/lib64 sort of thing
 lambday	new2shogun: I mean, that's where your libc.dylib is too, right? in /usr/lib
 lambday	?
 new2shogun	yes

 lambday_	iglesiasg: our friend here had bumped into a problem while building python modular on osx
@iglesiasg	lambday_, who?
 lambday_	iglesiasg: linking problem related to std::complex
 new2shogun	hi, thats me
 lambday_	iglesiasg: new2shogun :)
@iglesiasg	aham ok
@iglesiasg	I am not the best reference in os x though since I don't use it
 lambday_	same here :(
@iglesiasg	new2shogun,  where exactly is std::complex used that you are getting the error?
@iglesiasg	lambday_, did you try with wiking ?
 lambday_	iglesiasg: I pinged him but I guess he's away
 lambday_	iglesiasg: well, this is the error msg he's getting - http://n.ethz.ch/~eglif/download/shogun_cmake_make_python_modular_log.txt

 lambday	iglesiasg: by the way, how's things with you?
 lambday	you're mentoring this year?
 new2shogun	iglesias: i do not know where std::complex is used ... how can i find out?
 lambday	new2shogun: its in the core code (SGVector and many other places)...
@iglesiasg	lambday, everything good. I started my PhD this month
@iglesiasg	lambday, yep, I will mentor this year a project
 lambday	iglesiasg: great! :)
@iglesiasg	new2shogun, with the error message, but lambday just sent it to me so I will have a look now
@iglesiasg	lambday, are you applying as a student this year?
 lambday	iglesiasg: I am thinking of..
 new2shogun	iglesiasg: thanks!
@iglesiasg	new2shogun, not real clue why this may happen
@iglesiasg	new2shogun, so you want to use the python modular interface, right?
 new2shogun	yes, that is exactly what i want.
 lambday	iirc, few days back there was a post regarding this sort of error on osx
 lambday	I am not sure
