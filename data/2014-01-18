 lisitsyn	hey there
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hey ho
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: hey
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, wassup?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I almost finished my recognition job
 lisitsyn	a chance to get some spare time ;)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about you?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, fixing bugs as usual
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sounds like a great fun :D

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: tester
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - compare pickled output - if that matches return true already
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - if it doesn't match fall back to shogun eps comparison (not this can
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: differ due to representation inaccuracies of pickled objects)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we have some weird ones - extreme challenges :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the craziest one is that when I run the structure_multiclass_bmrm.py example
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I get MulticlassSOLabels,
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but when these are serialized I get StructuredLabels on disk!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ehm any idea?
 lisitsyn	is it casted up at some point?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no idea really none
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, at some point I thought it is related to gsomix' python hackery but then again it is returned to python correctly
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, want to learn sth?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, tell me
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, did you find out why the serialization error happens?
@iglesiasg	say yes please!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but there is an excellent method to find out which commit broke the mmd stuff
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, git bisect!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so what you would do is go to the shogun dir
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, do git bisect good
@sonney2k	for the last known working release
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and for stuff that doesnt' work git bisect bad
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, this means you likely need only 5 or so tries before we have the commti that broke the thing
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so plesae please figure out what did it!
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: zxtx
-!- Netsplit over, joins: zxtx
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, let me read the link
@iglesiasg	I don't really understand how it will work
@iglesiasg	I mean, how does git know when it is good or bad?
@iglesiasg	anyway, will read
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, funny thing is that even if can remove some commits from the search space by putting bad several commits before the current develop tip
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am not sure at all where good is
