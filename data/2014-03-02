 kislay	I am currently working on PCA on the python wrappers of the preprocessor. Except for the examples, do we have some other documentation showing what different methods are present under it
 kislay	for example: preprocessor.init(), preprocessor.apply_to_feature_matrix()

@iglesiasg	kislay, the doxygen documentation
@iglesiasg	kislay, http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CPreprocessor.html
 kislay	yup! i got it. It will take time for me to get a hang of c++ as i am adept in python.

 Calvin-O	having trouble with installation.. if i change to build directory, i get an error saying the directory does not appear to contain CMakeLists. txt
 Calvin-O	what am i missing?
 lambday	Calvin-O: you need to use the parent cmake.txt, use cmake <your cmake options> ..
 Calvin-O	but i see no such options when using cmake - -help
 lambday	Calvin-O: where is your build directory?
 lambday	Calvin-O: you need to tell cmake to use the CMakeList.txt in your shogun/root
 Calvin-O	shogun/root? the clone that i have from git doesn't have this folder
 Calvin-O	there's shogun/src/shogun which has CMakeLists.txt and there's ~/shogun which has CMakeLists.txt
 lambday	Calvin-O: by root I meant that only :D
 lambday	so you create your build directory inside ~/shogun, let's call it, wait for it, "build"... the inside build you issue your cmake command: something like: cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DPythonModular=ON ..
 lambday	Calvin-O: don't forget the ".." in the end
 Calvin-O	yea okay but i have been using cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" inside this directory
 Calvin-O	what am i missing?
 lambday	Calvin-O: the build directory doesn't have the CMakeLists.txt, right?
 lambday	so that's missing :(
 lambday	you need to append ".."
 Calvin-O	why am i bettering my own records at dumbness these days.. last day while doing bisection using matlab i put brackets at the wrong place and was stuck on this for a while.. thanks :)
 lambday	Calvin-O: don't worry, man! :)
