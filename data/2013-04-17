 randomname	I did ./configure --interfaces=python_modular,python_static
 randomname	and then make
 randomname	wasn't it enough? Or am i missing something?
 randomname	Similarly in python_static : The same line
 randomname	" from sg import sg"
 randomname	Anyone there?
 randomname	shogun-toolbox: there?
 votjak	randomname: Do you run 'make install' after 'make'?
 randomname	oh..
 randomname	will try it just now
 randomname	tried .. but didn't work
 randomname	There were no errors on make install
 randomname	do you want me to put the output of make install?

@iglesiasg	deerishi: is kernel pca a preprocessor? I thought it was a converter
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: preprocessor still
@iglesiasg	aham I see
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: isn't included in tapkee then?
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 deerishi	i did preprocessor=KernelPCA(kernel) ,now m trying to plot the data
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it is -but currently it uses old code
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: understood
 deerishi	e.g.  the input data is 2x302 , but m getting a data of  1x302 after kernelpca
@iglesiasg	deerishi: maybe you should transpose the data? no real idea, just wild guess
 deerishi	willl just try that
@iglesiasg	deerishi: or wait, it sort of makes sense
@iglesiasg	deerishi: you have 302 points in 2D right? two points in R^302 sounds weird - too few points
 deerishi	i have 2 not separable datasets ,i.e total of 302 points in 2d
 deerishi	the data is 2 semicircular arcs
 deerishi	in  the same quadrants
@iglesiasg	deerishi: why are you talking about separable datasets?
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@lisitsyn	kpca has nothing to do with separability
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has joined #shogun
 deerishi	but one should be able to distinguish 2 sets os data,after kernel pca,rite?
@lisitsyn	ah yes
@iglesiasg	deerishi: one should be, but the method is not going to tell you about that
 deerishi	k.I am trying to solve the bug about kernelpca test/check .
 deerishi	i should be able to see after plotting that kernel pca works,
 deerishi	the dimension of the data i am getting is just a single row,how can i plot that and see if the algorithim has worked or not?
@lisitsyn	well plot points on a line
@iglesiasg	if your intuition is correct, then you should see two parts of the line populated with points

 sonne|work	HeikoS: any comments about the workshop announcement mail?
 sonne|work	If not I will send it out this evening.
 HeikoS	sonne|work: ah sorry, haven't looked yet, will do now
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am afraid you speak about PCA
@lisitsyn	not kPCA
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: there is no such thing like projection matrix in kpca
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: what does the projection matrix give you then?
 HeikoS	or transformation matrix
 HeikoS	this is a matrix that the data is projected on
 HeikoS	at least this is what the apply method does
 HeikoS	not correct?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes, already projected data
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: so the get_transformation matrix method returns the projected data?
 HeikoS	what does apply_to_features do?
 HeikoS	if I look at the code this looks like a projection
@lisitsyn	let me check
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ehmm

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it is something strange
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha :)
 HeikoS	good that we started investigating :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well may be I misunderstand something
@lisitsyn	but kpca is not a linear method
@lisitsyn	in my head
 HeikoS	it is in the feature space right?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: top eigenvectors of centered kernel matrix
 HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	that is the projection
@lisitsyn	not a projection matrix to be multiplied
 HeikoS	so the projection is
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah it seems everything is ok here
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: so whats the difference between apply and get_transform?
@lisitsyn	but my understanding of kpca was not complete

 sonne|work	wiking: just look at shogun's debian package
 wiking	so for r_*, lua_*, csharp_* etc
 wiking	ok
 sonne|work	ahh true

 randomname	hi
@iglesiasg	hey randomname
 randomname	Is there any class similar to SGVector for priority_queue or heap ?
 randomname	I mean something similar to SGHeap
@iglesiasg	randomname: IIRC there is some fibonacci head somewhere
@iglesiasg	fibonacci heap, not head hehe
@lisitsyn	I removed that as it was not needed
@lisitsyn	randomname: what for?
@iglesiasg	randomname: anyway, if you just need to use it in your cpp (not in header) feel free to use STL
 randomname	we can use STL ?
 randomname	thats great :)
 deerishi	https://github.com/deerishi/KernelPCA-test-check/commit/80b334747ebd176d3e8602bacbff996dbcce54cf#commitcomment-3029465
@iglesiasg	randomname: but only in implementation files please, not headers
 deerishi	have posted the kernelpca test.check
 randomname	lisitsyn: I need for a patch on Ball Tree for KNN
 deerishi	can anyone see the result and get back to me
 deerishi	i have also posted the plots of the results
@iglesiasg	deerishi: the second plot is the density of the points after kpca I guess
@iglesiasg	deerishi: or?
 deerishi	yes
@iglesiasg	so no actual coordinates right?
@iglesiasg	I think it looks fine
@iglesiasg	I wonder why one of them is in 50 and the other in 200 though, since the original are of radii 50 and 100
@iglesiasg	but I guess it is fine
 deerishi	i just took the vector returned after apply_to _feature_matrices and plotted it
@lisitsyn	randomname: yes, use stl priority heap in .cpp
 randomname	I have another question: I should be making another class BallTreeNodeData.h or just a simple struct def in the code will do ?
 randomname	lisitsyn: thanks :)
 deerishi	@iglesiasg ,so did i do as per required in the task?
 deerishi	?
@lisitsyn	randomname: that's ok to have struct here I believe
 randomname	lisitsyn: thanks :) that helped ... I was on my way to make separate class files for Ball Tree Node :)
@iglesiasg	deerishi: do you think the second plot with the results makes sense?
 randomname	but now I can do it with just a struct :)

 deerishi	@iglesiasg : no but i am having doubt in what data to plot to check if kernel pca has worked or not
 deerishi	any suggestions on how to improve
@iglesiasg	deerishi: you can draw inspiration from http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_kernel_pca.html
@lisitsyn	it actually makes sense to make an homomorphous mapping here 2d->2d
@lisitsyn	as it is implicitly \inf d -> 2d
@lisitsyn	in case of gaussian kernel
@iglesiasg	what is homomorphous in this context?
@iglesiasg	simply that it doesn't reduce dim?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: X -> X
@iglesiasg	ok
@lisitsyn	doesn't change the space
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: as we are actually mapping rkhs of X -> X
@lisitsyn	I think that's ok
@iglesiasg	rkhs?
@lisitsyn	reproducing kernel hilbert space
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: see we have some youth!
@lisitsyn	:)

 deerishi	@iglesiasg : i have a doubthttp://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/1.0.0/KernelPCA_8cpp_source.html#l00133 .according to this the matrix returned by the function should be the matrix after kpca.(that is what i had plotted).
@iglesiasg	:)
 deerishi	?
 deerishi	or am i interpreting it wrong
@iglesiasg	deerishi: what's the question? :)
-!- deerishi_ [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 deerishi	i want to see the data after kpca
 deerishi	and the above function returns that matrix
 deerishi	rite?
@iglesiasg	CSimpleFeatures, that code is outdated I am afraid
@iglesiasg	deerishi: apply to feature matrix returns the features after kPCA has been applied
@iglesiasg	check doc in the current code

 wiking	HeikoS: ping
 HeikoS	wiking: pong, hi!
 HeikoS	sonne|work, I meant the python for travis
 wiking	HeikoS: what's with those integration scripts? .m ?
 wiking	HeikoS: one is failing for some reason on travis
 HeikoS	ehm
 HeikoS	does it fail on the buildbot?
 HeikoS	no idea
 wiking	mmm lemme check
 wiking	btw have u ever used ruby_modular?
 wiking	it seems it does not fail on buildbot :D
 wiking	classified: 1.717182e-01, bias: 0.000000e+00 <--- accuracy: 1.000000e-04
 HeikoS	weird
 wiking	in /SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_16_05_False.m
 HeikoS	maybe some library not available?
 wiking	everything else works fine
 wiking	only this one fails
 wiking	e.g. SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_1_05_False.m
 wiking	aaaah
 wiking	why might SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_1_05_False.m be skipped?
 wiking	because of some library missing?
 HeikoS	no I mean sometimes we have fallback code
 HeikoS	when a library is not available
 HeikoS	which might be less accurate
 wiking	according to diff -uN ./data/testsuite/classifier/SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_16_05_False.m ./data/testsuite/classifier/SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_1_05_False.m
 wiking	the only difference is the number of threads
 HeikoS	mmh
 HeikoS	that doesnt sound good ;)
 wiking	anyhow it skips SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_1_05_False.m and SubGradientSVM_30_1en05_16_05_False.m fails with that error
 wiking	if anybody has any idea what's going on please let me know, i.e. knows what package might be missing etc :
 wiking	:)
 HeikoS	wiking: sonney2k might know
 gsomix	HeikoS, hey, have a minute? just little question. as you know lisitsyn came up new syntax for modelselection.
 gsomix	like ModelSelectionParameter("kernel").as(ValuesSet).from([gaussian_kernel, linear_kernel, chi2_kernel]);
 HeikoS	gsomix:  sure
 HeikoS	I think its documented in the issue
 gsomix	how do you think is it good to store ModelselectionParameter in SGObjects?
 gsomix	for syntax like yet_another_machine.paramete('kernel').as(...)...
 HeikoS	gsomix: I dont understand
 HeikoS	the model selection parameters are already stored in the SGObject
 HeikoS	but we need to construct the parameter tree from this syntax
 HeikoS	curently, those trees are created by hand
 HeikoS	see python modelselection examples
 HeikoS	this should be easier
 gsomix	HeikoS, err. I mean to store parameters tree in SGObject.
 gsomix	for automagically constructing without new local variables in code
 HeikoS	I see
 HeikoS	so I would just make this syntax return a parameter tree
 HeikoS	and those can then be appended to each other
 HeikoS	and the modelselection class takes parameter trees as inputs

 gsomix	HeikoS, got it, thanks. I have to think about...
 HeikoS	gsomix: this is a messy topic
 HeikoS	maybe try to construct some trees by hands
 HeikoS	I think most cases are covered in the examples
 HeikoS	this helped me a lot back then

 Asix3	Greetings! I'm interested in working for Shogun through GSOC. I have a little background in both machine learning and C++, but not much else -- including git and working on large scale projects. I'm looking at Large Scale Learning & Dimension reduction using hashing.
@lisitsyn	Asix3: hey
 Asix3	@lisitsyn: Hi! I didn't expect a response so quickly. I'm basically wondering if I'd be a good candidate given my background. I've nearly worked through stanfords free machine learning course, now available on coursera -- found it challenging, but also interesting and completely doable. Aside from that I've taken a few courses in C++, two were introductory and one was on algorithms and data structures
@lisitsyn	Asix3: I'd suggest start learning the project structure and try to improve anything (you may find some issues at github)
 Asix3	@lisitsyn: Will do! Thank you!
@lisitsyn	Asix3: we are searching for motivated and interested students :)
@lisitsyn	so background matters but not that much
 Asix3	I'm definitely both... Thanks again. You will be seeing more of me on this channel as I try to set up shogun and submit work on one of your entry tasks
@lisitsyn	Asix3: would be nice!
