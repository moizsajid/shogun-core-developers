 thegruel	Hi all
 blackburn	hey
 thegruel	This time, I'm having trouble with CLibSVM's train() using python_modular. It sometimes returns "True", but has bias==NaN and empty SVs. Any tips?
 blackburn	what is kernel you use?
 blackburn	C?
 thegruel	CustomKernel (precomputed linear, actually), but PosDef-ness should not be an issue, even after adding a ridge it failed.
 blackburn	is kernel properly normalized?
 blackburn	and did you try other solvers?
 thegruel	Yes, it's normalized. But that shouldn't matter, right? If it's the kernel's fault, the training shouldn't return "True", right?
 thegruel	Other solvers instaed of LibSVM you mean? No, not yet. All the other SVMs version were super-slow with large kernel matrices.
 blackburn	thegruel: you may try to check debug prints however I am unsure if it would help
 thegruel	MSG_DEBUG says:
 thegruel	[INFO] 96 trainlabels [INFO] Computing gradient for initial set of non-zero alphas [INFO]  optimization finished, #iter = 1 [INFO] nu = -nan [INFO] obj = -nan, rho = -nan [INFO] nSV = 0, nBSV = 0 [INFO] Total nSV = 0
 thegruel	Oops... Sorry, there seems to be a NaN in the kernel matrix... How did that get there???
 blackburn	hehe
 thegruel	Okay, issue solved (or rather: false alarm) thanks!

 yoo	hi all
 blackburn	hey
 yoo	how are you ?
 blackburn	yoo: sorry I forgot to add multiclass things to xvaloutput
 blackburn	I am setting up things for shogun dev at my job hehe
 yoo	blackburn: yea, since you didnt sent me the confirmation mail, I thought you didnt have time yet for this
 blackburn	I can do that today I think
 yoo	blackburn: great
 yoo	blackburn: I tried last night to compile shogun with mosek support but I cant make shogun find it
 blackburn	yeahh that is an issue
 yoo	blackburn: mosek is well installed
 yoo	blackburn:  ahah ok then :p
 n4nd0	yoo: you can make a couple of modifications to your .config file in order to configure with MOSEK support
 n4nd0	you'd do them after running ./configure and note that those will be removed every time you run ./configure again
 yoo	blackburn: when multiclass thgs will be added to xvaloutput, I will probably make up-to-date c++ examples and maybe create new ones
 yoo	thanks, i'll try it
 n4nd0	yoo: let me know if you need to know what these modifications are
 yoo	n4nd0: do you have a log of your .config file ?
 n4nd0	yoo: I already explained these changes by mail to other people, I can just forward that mail to you if you like
 yoo	n4nd0: yes, it will be kind of you!
 yoo	thereisnoknife@gmail.com
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k: I've just issued a PR with the warning fixed
 n4nd0	yoo: hehe funny address :)
 blackburn	I want to have a switch 'merge all PRs automatically'
 yoo	I am in the shogun mailing list by the way
 n4nd0	yoo: sent
 yoo	n4nd0: thx
 yoo	clang++ compilation :p
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	try with the standard first
 n4nd0	I had to use clang++ but it seemed that the problem was in my machine
 n4nd0	sonney2k could compile the things with the compiler used in the makefile
 yoo	ok

 uricamic	hi
 wiking	hey !
 uricamic	can I submit some data to shogun-data? MINST database in svmlight format
 blackburn	if it is not that big feel free :)
 uricamic	I want to submit benchmark that needs this data
 blackburn	what is size?
 uricamic	3 files, trn file cca 108MB, validation and test about 10MB each
 blackburn	oh that's big
 uricamic	yep, the train set is quite big
 uricamic	or I could just send the example and one would need to download the data from somewhere else
 uricamic	it is 60k vectors, of dimension 784
 blackburn	what if we compress it?
 uricamic	that could help
 uricamic	and is it still possible to read it directly like any other svmlight formated file?
 blackburn	there should be some way using python (if you are going to use it)
 uricamic	yep
 uricamic	it is python example
 uricamic	ok, compressed it is 32MB total (3 files)
 blackburn	uricamic: other way is to implement downloader
 uricamic	blackburn: what do you mean by that?
 blackburn	you can post it on mldata.org and implement a script that downloads
@sonney2k	uricamic, why don't you compress the stuff w/ bz2?
 blackburn	the dataset on the first run
 uricamic	I see, is there already such example?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is wrong with CIA-36
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no commit messages anymore
 uricamic	sonney2k: compressed zip files are now 27.5 MB and 2x 9.1MB

 yoh_	nah -- I am from yesterday's evening ;)
 blackburn	yoh_: it's been a while - when did you join us last time?
 yoh_	sonney2k: so -- what are the chances/ways to get recent version to wheezy?
 yoh_	blackburn: do not know really ;)
 blackburn	if n4nd0 doesn't know you then it is greater than one year
 blackburn	and actually I remember you were chatting with soeren in march, 2011 last time :D
 yoh_	blackburn: for the curious ones: --- Log opened Thu Mar 24 14:04:20 2011
 blackburn	yeah
 yoh_	blackburn: yeah
 yoh_	;-)
 n4nd0	blackburn: impressive memory! and you were saying you don't have much memory capacity ...
 yoh_	I just whined to Soeren in email and he suggested to chat online
 yoh_	so here I am
 blackburn	yoh_: we are planning to release 2.0 September the first - our favourite day
@sonney2k	yoh_, ahh yaroslav
@sonney2k	hey
 blackburn	hahah
 yoh_	blackburn: that is great... atm wheezy is scheduled to be released with 0.9 ! ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: werre you computing scores to estimate who could that be?
 blackburn	0.9? oh nice
@sonney2k	yoh_, let me first explain the problems I have with packaging:
@sonney2k	biggest problem of all is that compiling shogun's interfaces w/ gcc would require >3GB of memory
 yoh_	sonney2k: I think I know the core -- building all those interfaces across platforms
 yoh_	ah... and that ;)
@sonney2k	yoh_, and debian builders limit things to (I don't recall) but say 2GB
 yoh_	I believe I ran into similar problems with some other package that there were simply no RAM avail on that architecture (s390?...)
 yoh_	that is I why I suggest
@sonney2k	if we had a program that could split up a single 40MB .cpp file into multiple ones we could compile with gcc and all good
 yoh_	to check with ftpmasters if they would simply allow removal of shogun from wheezy
 yoh_	first and then where it builds -- it builds and gets into wheezy
@sonney2k	but since this is not available we just use clang
@sonney2k	clang works just fine on some archs (requiring much less memory)
@sonney2k	but obviously has bugs
@sonney2k	yoh_, I don't recall by heart but IIRC it crashes on powerpc and creates a weird linker error on s390
@sonney2k	both bugs in clang but I simply don't have the time to prove that with isolated examples
@sonney2k	yoh_, then the other issue with python:
@sonney2k	I certainly never manually created anything under /usr/*/python*
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
@sonney2k	however, I switched python packaging to hmmhh what was it dh_python2 or sth?
@sonney2k	so I guess there is some issue when the old package is still using the other debian python packaging system
@sonney2k	yoh_, so no idea about those errors
@sonney2k	that's all
@sonney2k	yoh_, any suggestions?
 yoh_	once again -- with all those problems on fancy architectures -- I would have talked to ftpmasters to see if they would agree to just remove shogun from wheezy altogether and allow it propagate from sid
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:dc2c:b66c:3452:bc42] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 yoh_	the same happened for ANTs and openmeeg
 yoh_	but they were removed even before the freeze IIRC
@sonney2k	sure that would work
 yoh_	as for python, I guess you meant the one I have filed: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=682166    just needs a look (deboostrap squeeze in a directory, install shogun) and go through upgrade to see WTF .  But probably better at once to check upgrade to 1.1.0 version in sid
@sonney2k	yoh_, yeah but I don't know what to do about it
@sonney2k	yoh_, that is dh_python2 (or the old system trying to remove stuff)
 yoh_	I haven't looked into details of this one... but I have ran into it while upgrading from 1.0.0 not 0.9.3... and that one doesn't have those directories (checked on squeeze system)
 yoh_	so might it be specific to upgrades from 1.0.0?
 yoh_	ah damn -- I just saw it  -- you are not in wheezy already
@sonney2k	yoh_, it is weird: squeeze has
@sonney2k	Kernel.py -> /usr/share/pyshared/shogun/Kernel.py
@sonney2k	etc in there
 yoh_	right, so no /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/shogun, which I guess came with 1.0.0 version right?
@sonney2k	momplz kids crying
 yoh_	as for http://release.debian.org/migration/testing.pl?package=shogun  - I am still not sure -- why does it wait for those architectures... or if it doesn't  -- why claims dependency on octave which you disabled entirely?
 yoh_	and then "mono-2.0-devel " dependency -- was that automatically placed? may be just needs a rebuild?
 yoh_	so if I were you I was bold and talked to ftp/release teams to figure out what is needed to be done
@sonney2k	yoh_, it would build on octave w/o trouble btw
@sonney2k	problem is just that octave requires even more memory
 yoh_	after testing upgrade path first for 0.9.3 -> 1.1.0-5 -- may be there is no problem
@sonney2k	(C++ templated code...)
 yoh_	but now it is disabled (you commented out binary package right)?
@sonney2k	yoh_, I think so yes
 yoh_	I doubt that you should worry about that ATM -- imho minimal plan should be to get current version as is into wheezy and then may be fix bugs up (e.g. if there is the upgrade problem ;) )
@sonney2k	yoh_, if I had time I would redo the packaging and split it up to compile just libshogun for all archs using gcc
@sonney2k	then do the same for all interfaces separately...
@sonney2k	sure
 yoh_	if you had a chance, not time ;)  those evil ftp/release- teams might simply not allow such radical changes
 yoh_	;-)
@sonney2k	yoh_, alright ... let me debootstrap squeeze.
 yoh_	and I would have checked with release team why britney (?) demands those builds for other architectures since "[2011-10-06] shogun REMOVED from testing (Britney)"
@sonney2k	yoh_, no problem installing shogun from squeeze -> sid

 yoh_	sonney2k: [no problem installing shogun from squeeze -> sid] good -- leave a comment to that bug report and downgrade importance if it was high ;)
 yoh_	so it is left to figure out why it didn't get into wheezy ;)

 gsomix	sonney2k, hey
 gsomix	sonney2k, can I change some constructors and methods needed for zero-copy and write typemaps? foobar(SGMatrix) -> foobar(SGMatrix, bool copy), I mean
 gsomix	thanks
 gsomix	oh no, I cant :(
 n4nd0	good night guys

@sonney2k	yoh_, but actually there was someone noting how to reproduce the issue
@sonney2k	yoh_, just do apt-get install --reinstall shogun-python-modular on your machine and voila!
@sonney2k	gsomix, the problem is that for the typemaps to work you would then need either typemaps that operate on SGVector, bool
 yoh_	sonney2k: ah
@sonney2k	or some flag inside SGVector
 yoh_	sonney2k: indeed
 yoh_	ah... you have all kinds of "stuff" in your shogun-python-modular.preinst
 yoh_	and shogun-python-static.preinst -- I guess forgotten to be removed when switched from pycentral ;)
@sonney2k	yoh_, it can only happen on upgrade
 yoh_	sonney2k: yeap -- all that on if [ "$1" = upgrade ]
 yoh_	;)
@sonney2k	yoh_, ok there is a shogun-elwms-static.preinst
 yoh_	sorry for misleading
@sonney2k	etc
 yoh_	I guess it is rm -f /usr/lib/python$pyversion/$pydir/shogun/*
 yoh_	in shogun-python-modular.preinst
 yoh_	which is not conditioned on " dpkg --compare-versions "$2" lt 0.9.3-3 "
 yoh_	so you always invoke it
@sonney2k	I have absolutely no idea if removing the *preinst* files would be OK...
 yoh_	well -- theoretically all those manual cleanups should not be necessary at all, right?
@sonney2k	indeed prerm contains
@sonney2k	pyclean -p shogun-python-modular
 yoh_	and you had them there for some previous versions... probably prior 1.0... so why not condition such and be done?  you probably would know more ;)
 yoh_	pyclean (from manpage) just removes complied .py[co] -- that is different
 yoh_	just look when/why you introduced those total cleanup loop -- may be you could simply condition it on some earlier version as well and be done ;)
 yoh_	probably prior 1.xxx versions
@sonney2k	yoh_, I didn't no clue about this hack
@sonney2k	yoh_, OK in dh_python2 packages are done more robust: every symlink / dir is already inside the package visible via dpkg -L ...
 yoh_	it was only your 2 commits which worked on that .preinst :-P
@sonney2k	and just /usr/share/pyshared contains the stuff
 yoh_	sonney2k: yes, with dh_python2 everything is in the package (so needs binary rebuilds for new supported python versions)
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, there is another problem. typemaps doesn't make sense, when we need to overload free_feature_matrix with hack
 gsomix	:(
@sonney2k	yoh_, that makes a *lot* of sense
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, I have implemented new inplace arithmetic mechanism. ?ow the behavior is the same as in numpy.
 gsomix	*now
@sonney2k	gsomix, you mean you can do shogun dense featurematrix x : x+=1 ?
@sonney2k	that worked already - so what did you change?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
 gsomix	worked? O_o
 gsomix	wait... how?
@sonney2k	gsomix, err you did that a month back IIRC?!
 gsomix	yep, but only for matrices with same type and shape and buffer
@sonney2k	yoh_, I think this preinst is still needed - at least I don't understand how the files in /usr/lib/python2.X/dist-packages/shogun/* will be removed?
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh
@sonney2k	so now you can do these ops for scalars and other compatible shapes?
 gsomix	yep
 gsomix	like in numpy, because I use numpy's number protocol (I need send letter to this guys)
 yoh_	sonney2k: do you mean on new installations?  dh_python2 should take care about that ... it should add call to update-python-modules  -c in prerm
 gsomix	at now I want only one thing - RealFeatures(my_cool_matrix, copy=False). :(
@sonney2k	yoh_, for new installations it will work
 yoh_	so - for new packages there should be no manual anything in .pre/post scripts... at least I never add anything ;)  whatever problems you were resolving before should thus be conditioned on those old versions
@sonney2k	yoh_, since 1.0.0-1 it uses dh_python2
 yoh_	good -- so why not condition that manual rm on pre-1.0.0-1 of the version to be upgraded from?
@sonney2k	so maybe conditioning on that could work
@sonney2k	gsomix, I don't see that happening w/o adding new typemaps / constructors
 yoh_	sonney2k: but once again -- figure out first is there anything else to fix to get current revision into wheezy

@sonney2k	yoh_, I cannot fix clang though
 yoh_	rright -- but that is only on some architectures, right?  ATM there is no shogun on ANY architecture in wheezy
@sonney2k	yoh_, there are of course no bug
@sonney2k	s
 yoh_	of cause not -- are you writing a buggy software? ;)
 gsomix	sonney2k, nite. PR will be tomorrow, and I will star work on typemap for modelsel.
 gsomix	good night guys
 yoh_	gsomix: sleep tight!
@sonney2k	yoh_, alright - so before 0.9.3-3 shogun packages where using pycentral
@sonney2k	that is what the first comparison is for
@sonney2k	now I would jsut add
@sonney2k	if dpkg --compare-versions "$2" lt 0.10.0-1 ; then
@sonney2k	aroudn the other rm -rf
@sonney2k	rm -f that is
@sonney2k	yoh_, and do a new upload
 yoh_	but why new upload? (or to experimental?)
@sonney2k	no to sid?
 yoh_	I would have first figured out WTF will be happening with package -- will it go into wheezy at all at this point
@sonney2k	I mean the bug is there right?
@sonney2k	yoh_, no matter what - the current version is useless
 yoh_	yeah... bug is there but you do not know what release team thinks in general about this situation
 yoh_	yeah -- current one is buggy
 yoh_	anyways -- up to you ;-)
@sonney2k	yoh_, well shogun 1.1 is pretty outdated anyways after gsoc.
 yoh_	if I were you I would have just figured out "the plan" first ;)
 yoh_	so you do not want any shogun in wheezy?
@sonney2k	so if it is not in - it doesn't hurt
@sonney2k	no I wanted 1.1 in that is why I tried to fix all bugs that got reported in time
@sonney2k	but with these show stoppers I simply had no clue what to do
@sonney2k	and since the preinst scripts were not mine I could not even have imagined that we were messing with that stuff
@sonney2k	gsomix, thanks for your work - I would also suggest - you keep your frombuffer() functions for now
@sonney2k	and better work on model selection typemaps
@sonney2k	yoh_, btw do you still use shogun these days?
@sonney2k	yoh_, when you are awake I mean :D
