@wiking	lisitsyn, what do you mean? bool operator==(const T& x, const T& y) is the declaration of the equals
@wiking	or?
@wiking	i mean it sounds stupid though :)
@wiking	ah you mean virtual bool equals(CSGObject* other, float64_t accuracy=0.0, bool tolerant=false);
@wiking	?
@wiking	but then it should be fine :)
@wiking	ah but
@wiking	bool T::operator ==(const T2 &b) const;
@wiking	:)
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	that's a fun one
@wiking	:>
@wiking	btw lisitsyn blame Heiko for that design decision: https://github.com/dhruv13J/shogun/commit/ff244613212122d54b3de609c7c4d95a45dd026e#diff-1689b0bd3ceb28355cc3c05ed7ffe4f0
@wiking	rcurtin, sorry yesterday i've passed out
 rcurtin	no worries, I am about to pass out myself
 rcurtin	so maybe tomorrow :)
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	hahah ok
@wiking	just msg
@wiking	the problem is that i think we are in a 13 hours
@wiking	time diff
@wiking	you are east coast?
 rcurtin	yeah, east coast
 rcurtin	13 hours... where are you?
@wiking	singapore
 rcurtin	ah, okay
 rcurtin	well I will be awake tomorrow morning around 1300 UTC, so maybe you will still be awake then :)
@wiking	:)
@wiking	just ping me
 rcurtin	sure

 sanuj	wiking, there?
@wiking	sanuj, yes
 sanuj	wiking, so over here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3357/files/b79c74445e90a3930003d5a4e35385ca31ecfa42..f768dbc9fa02e71ff155de5051ece64faa868208#diff-af3b638bc2a3e6c650974192a53c7291R962
 sanuj	i need to check FIND_PACKAGE(JINJA2)
 sanuj	and then set ENABLE_TESTING or COMPILE_MODULAR_INTERFACE
 sanuj	?
@wiking	man
@wiking	i mean i dont understand
@wiking	check cmakelists.txt
 sanuj	not sure what your second comment means
@wiking	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun/blob/f768dbc9fa02e71ff155de5051ece64faa868208/CMakeLists.txt#L89
@wiking	why not check here the jinja2
@wiking	?
@wiking	i dont understand why do you need to create yet another branch
@wiking	that checks the same fucking thing
 sanuj	wiking, jinja2 is also required in ENABLE_TESTING
@wiking	and
@wiking	you leave it there
@wiking	and check it
@wiking	i dont get what's the problem
@wiking	come on
@wiking	let's be a bit more like a developer
@wiking	instead of a random code generator
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	just move the find pacakge there
@wiking	and you should be set
 sanuj	wiking, in that case i'll have to put 2 checks for JINJA2
@wiking	no just one
@wiking	you put one to the modular
@wiking	right?
@wiking	the other is already there
 sanuj	if no modular interfaces are enabled then it won't be checked
@wiking	or?
 sanuj	but we need to check for unit-tests also
@wiking	i'm sorry?
@wiking	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun/blob/f768dbc9fa02e71ff155de5051ece64faa868208/CMakeLists.txt#L960
@wiking	this check is for
@wiking	modular
@wiking	the one for the unit test
@wiking	is *already* there
 sanuj	yeah
@wiking	so?
 sanuj	i meant there will be 2 checks for jinja2 in the resultant code
 sanuj	if that's fine, then i'll do it
@wiking	and ?
@wiking	i mean in cmake taht check is actually cached
@wiking	if you do 2 times the same if in a codebase
@wiking	that wont work?
@wiking	or what? i mean i dont undestand here the concern
 sanuj	i was worrying about the redundancy of 2 checks for the same thing
 sanuj	i guess that's not a problem
 sanuj	so i'll do what you are suggesting
 sanuj	wiking, can you please rebase feature/tags with develop?
@wiking	sure
@wiking	gimem a sec
 sanuj	wiking, actually no need
 sanuj	lisitsyn pushed his commit on feature/tags
 sanuj	i just checked

 sanuj	lisitsyn, yo
 sanuj	there is a problem
@wiking	what is the problem sanuj ?
 sanuj	rebasing for that PR
 lisitsyn	oh I am a bit stucked with SG_ADD
 lisitsyn	I've implemented something working
 lisitsyn	but it has some nasty bug
 sanuj	lisitsyn, the problem is that sets() replaces Any object
 sanuj	or does operator=
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do we need a static method in Any that updates() the value
 sanuj	will be good for updating value of member variables
 lisitsyn	what for?
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	yeah maybe
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so sets() implementation should be changed i think
 sanuj	since the current version won't work for member variables
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we should just update the value of already existing Any object in the map
 sanuj	what do you think?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: what do you mean by won't work?
 lisitsyn	what bug do you have?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i don't have any bug
 sanuj	haven't tested it
 sanuj	but i mean
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/base/SGObject.h#L333
 lisitsyn	ah you mean we can't use this external pointer thing there/
 lisitsyn	because it is going to be replaced?
 sanuj	erase_type() makes a new Any object
 sanuj	yeah
 lisitsyn	oh well that's exactly what I am fighting with now
 lisitsyn	the last thing before SG_ADD works
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i think with this implementation the map object of Any will start pointing to new memory
 sanuj	instead of the m_member's memory
 sanuj	after it has been updated with sets()
 lisitsyn	you're right
 lisitsyn	lets try to fix it
 lisitsyn	:)
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	wanted to discuss with you the possible solutions
 sanuj	one way is to have an static update() in Any and use that
 lisitsyn	not sure have to think about it
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, sets() is only used after register_param(). So there is always an Any object in map when sets() is used to modify it. Whatever we do, it's best to change value of same memory instead of making a new Any object and changing the memory. Unnecessary creation and deletion of Any objects.

 sanuj	HeikoS, yo
 sanuj	the plan is to not replace TParamter
@HeikoS	sanuj:
 sanuj	just add tags parameter also
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	yeah thats ok
@HeikoS	sanuj: btw
 sanuj	to add a layer of new API
@HeikoS	remember our meeting?
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	the last shogun gsoc meeting
@HeikoS	there were some dates
@HeikoS	so you guys should wrap up soon
@HeikoS	to spend the rest of  the time writing docs and peer review
 sanuj	HeikoS, yes, see my timeline
@HeikoS	try to stop coding very soon
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	just wanted to remind :)
@HeikoS	I will leave for a trip soon
@HeikoS	and not be back before end of GSoC
@HeikoS	wiking: will merge things and handle the admin
@HeikoS	I will check back in September what was the result :)
@HeikoS	but yeah, as said in the meeting, the docs are really really important for us
 sanuj	HeikoS, where are you going?
 sanuj	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVV9KsHxpoj2G3HYYp-8MNjDpHVL0RGvj5hD0r03lgg/edit?usp=sharing
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'll write good docs
 sanuj	don't worry :D
@HeikoS	good! :)
@HeikoS	I think you got the hang of it by now!
@HeikoS	Looking fowrad to read things when back
 sanuj	HeikoS, cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: same for your stuff!
 sanuj	when are you leaving?
@HeikoS	now
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	HeikoS, enjoy your trip!!!
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	thanks a lot! :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, can you give me ideas about this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3390
@HeikoS	sanuj: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/147142817#L2744
@HeikoS	you can run the listing by hand
@HeikoS	ctest -R "testname"
@HeikoS	ah it doesnt even compile
@HeikoS	well look at the java code listing and see whats wrong
 sanuj	HeikoS, i need some ideas about enum
 sanuj	how to structure the tests?
@HeikoS	I they work in the existing meta examples dont they?
 sanuj	HeikoS, yes they work
@HeikoS	it is ok like this
@HeikoS	do something that makes sense
@HeikoS	it should be both illustrating the meta language, and also serve as systematic testing of the constructs
 sanuj	HeikoS, okay
@HeikoS	try to ask esben sorig
@HeikoS	he know what to do there
@HeikoS	and he might help a bit
@HeikoS	wiking or lisitsyn need to merge for now
 sanuj	HeikoS, sure sure
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok man, take care
@HeikoS	bye!
 sanuj	HeikoS, nice working with you too! :D
 sanuj	have fun
@HeikoS	sanuj: thanks! :) and see you soon !
