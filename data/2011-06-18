@sonney2k	blackburn1, could you please not use random data but load any of the toy data in your example scripts?
@sonney2k	or save the random data and make me upload it
 blackburn1	sonney2k: no problem
 blackburn1	in a minute
 blackburn1	sonney2k: done
 blackburn1	oh
 blackburn1	you already merged..
 blackburn1	I've done amend commit
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	can you do the merge
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn1	I'll try
 blackburn1	messed it up! damn
 blackburn1	sonney2k: it is ok now
 CIA-32	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * re8143c5 / (3 files): Fixed examples - http://bit.ly/kDUusR
@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw regarding the bool vs enum issue - I became a big fan of using enums not boolean...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: just worried of usage in interfaces
@sonney2k	blackburn1, it is just more readable when someone writes  optimizer(E_MAXIMIZE) instead of optimizer(true)
 blackburn1	if it is ok - sure I'm for that too
@sonney2k	blackburn1, people just have to import the constants too
 blackburn1	my opinion is if it is non-binary then better boolean
 blackburn1	tfu
 blackburn1	vice versa
 blackburn1	I mean if there are many options - it is better of course - we simply can't do this with boolean
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yeah I used to do that as well but I no longer like it
@sonney2k	simply because one cannot see from the line optimizer(true) what it will do
 blackburn1	agree
* sonney2k checks the weekly reports
 blackburn1	I did :P
@bettyboo	8)
@sonney2k	we need a better scheme with some subject rules like weekly report #xx it becomes messy now
@sonney2k	I think f-x and sploving are still missing
 blackburn1	sonney2k: alesis too
 blackburn1	it is just sunday now, may be they will report today
@sonney2k	blackburn1, ahh sploving did already
@sonney2k	btw did you read his mail
@sonney2k	we need to return SGVector / SGMatrix stuff in evaluation
@sonney2k	otherwise the interface will not recognize
 blackburn1	oh I didn't
 blackburn1	could you please say date?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yesterday 11:51
@sonney2k	weekly report :)
 blackburn1	aha
 blackburn1	I see
 blackburn1	will change
 blackburn1	sonney2k: should get_ROC return a copy of roc graph?
@sonney2k	if possible never copy
 blackburn1	I don't remember why I used copy
 blackburn1	ah, I guess because of typemaps
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yes that was the default before
@sonney2k	for these swig compat functions
 blackburn1	okay
@sonney2k	done?
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r3c48b36 / src/libshogun/preprocessor/LocallyLinearEmbedding.cpp :
 CIA-32	shogun: add a dummy return statement - even though it never reached it fixes a
 CIA-32	shogun: compiler warning - http://bit.ly/kIZks3
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r1b54f6b / examples/undocumented/java_modular/check.sh : don't output anything in check script - http://bit.ly/kqsSkc
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb0c6415 / (2 files): add SGMatrix<float64_t> support to custom kernel constructor - http://bit.ly/iuCKM7
 blackburn1	sonney2k: not yet, fixing graphical examples
@sonney2k	blackburn1, ? how is that related?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: well I have stored roc graph row-major
 blackburn1	changing it
@sonney2k	ahh the old problem :)
 blackburn1	ah twisted mind
 blackburn1	for column major: 2 columns
 blackburn1	2*j and 2*j+1?
 blackburn1	yes
@sonney2k	:)
@bettyboo	;)
 blackburn1	btw this example was wrong anyway
 blackburn1	classify() is used
 blackburn1	done
