 CaBa	wiking: happen to be around?
@wiking	yes
 CaBa	wiking: given a CParamterCombination object, can i iterate through the tree and access the parameters?
 CaBa	wiking: or doesn't it offer a public interface for that?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	good questuin
@wiking	*question
@wiking	if not then we should expose it
@wiking	what does doxygen say?
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/api/latest/classshogun_1_1CParameterCombination.html
 CaBa	wiking: well there is a get_parameter(const char *name, CSGObject *parent) function - i'm not sure if it is for that...
@wiking	doesn't look like you gonna get
@wiking	i mean that you can iterate through with that api
 CaBa	wiking: with that get_parameter() function?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	it'll give you a param
@wiking	with a given name and parent
@wiking	but this way
@wiking	you would need to know
@wiking	the name and parent
@wiking	i guess if you have the reference
 CaBa	what's the parent?
@wiking	parent of the given param
@wiking	so manually
@wiking	if you have the reference on the ROOT item in the tree
 CaBa	so how do i get one step down from the root using this function?
@wiking	then you could say
@wiking	get_parameter("name of param", ROOT);
@wiking	and then like this
@wiking	one by one
@wiking	you can iterate through the whole tree
 CaBa	so i do
@wiking	i'm wondering whether this is the only way
 CaBa	root->get_paramter("name", root)
 CaBa	?
@wiking	i would hope that there's
 CaBa	i pass root to itself?
@wiking	a better function for this
@wiking	but i never really looked into this part of shogun unfortunately
@wiking	didn't dare to ;)
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/api/latest/ParameterCombination_8cpp_source.html#l00250
@wiking	as you can see
@wiking	this is the implementation
 CaBa	wiking: #255 will never evaluate true for the root node
 CaBa	wiking: hm, maybe it doesn't have to...
@wiking	255?
 CaBa	line
 CaBa	from your lin
 CaBa	link
@wiking	if (m_param)
@wiking	?
 CaBa	yes
 CaBa	m_param is a Parameter* member, which should be a nulptr for root i think
@wiking	btw just for the record
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/api/latest/ParameterCombination_8cpp_source.html#l00307
@wiking	this will print you the tree
@wiking	if yo udont wanna print
@wiking	there's the logic
 CaBa	wiking: yes, that's what i want to do from the outside
@wiking	how to actually traverse the tree
@wiking	ok so there's the code
@wiking	right?
 CaBa	wiking: no, whats in that function does not work through public interfaces
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so create a PR
@wiking	that uses that logic
@wiking	and does
@wiking	iterator()
 CaBa	>.<
@wiking	and basically you implement an iterator for that whole thing
@wiking	pretty simple
@wiking	you have there the code yourself how to iterate through the tree
@wiking	but instead of printint
@wiking	printing
@wiking	you return always the next element
@wiking	it's almost a copy paste shit
@wiking	and you are done
 CaBa	no, extremely frustrating if that whole logic of that data structure is a mystery to you...
@wiking	yeah but
@wiking	it's not
@wiking	there's the src
@wiking	this is why it's opensource
@wiking	you can see what's happening under the hood
@wiking	and add new functionality
@wiking	that might be interesting for other people as well
@wiking	and in this case
@wiking	that request that you have
@wiking	is super valid
@wiking	as well as that the solution for it is super easy
@wiking	as you just copy paste shit
 CaBa	i know it's probably unfair to complain, but the level of documentation is really not such that one can easily understand the code by reading it
@wiking	are you serious?
@wiking	i have not
@wiking	ever looked into this src
@wiking	just now
@wiking	and in 2 minutes i gave you an answer
@wiking	how you could do it
@wiking	so please
@wiking	but
@wiking	if you think that it's not adequate enough
@wiking	please go ahead
@wiking	and send in PRs
@wiking	for having better documentation
@wiking	we are an open source project
@wiking	with 0 income
@wiking	all of us does this out of passion
@wiking	this is as much we could do free
@wiking	if you think that there's some more need to be fixed
@wiking	please go ahead
@wiking	we know that we are not perfect
@wiking	and never will be
@wiking	but we are trying to make things better as much as we can
 CaBa	i know, that's why i raised the fairness disclaimer. i totally sympathise with your situation, really do...
@wiking	so ok
@wiking	then if you want
@wiking	patch it
@wiking	and send it
@wiking	:)
@wiking	other than that
@wiking	unfortunately personally
@wiking	i have other priorities
@wiking	in this project
@wiking	so i wont be able to help you with it
@wiking	but again
@wiking	the solution
@wiking	is pretty simple
 CaBa	wiking: i know. i also didn't expect you to. i just wanted to know if i was overlooking an interfae that's there. totally aware that if there wasn't any, nobody was going to make me one..
@wiking	mmm based on the
@wiking	interface of that class
@wiking	it seems there's no iterator for it
@wiking	but
@wiking	i could imagine that there's somewhere else
@wiking	but there's just a small chance for it
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	wiking: wirred bug costed me half my day today... i patched something in shogun to take an std::function and used it from my program code... shogun i build with gcc-6 (for openmp) and my own code i build with clang...
 CaBa	wiking: that didn't go well at all... for whatever reason the std::function object didn't make it to the shogun world. only after i started building also my own code with gcc-6 it worked fine.
 CaBa	wiking: c++11 foo still seems to be weak at some points between compilers / libc implementations...
 CaBa	even with the latest and greatest xcode and gcc-6...
 CaBa	maybe just the former...
