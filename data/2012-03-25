 Miggy	hi blackburn
 blackburn	hi
 Miggy	i was wondering if u can mail me ur last year gsoc application so that i can have an idea about the application
 Miggy	my mail id is: manu_8819@yahoo.co.in
 blackburn	I am afraid I lost it
 Miggy	can u send me any application which was accepted?
 blackburn	no I have no access to such applications :)
 Miggy	sad ok
 blackburn	just follow application template
 blackburn	what can I say definitely is all last year participants were developing for shogun
 blackburn	so try to come up with something
 Miggy	ok
 blackburn	I mean it is not about awesome application
 blackburn	but rather your background with shogun
 Miggy	i wanted to know how u proceeded with dimensionlaity reduction steps
 blackburn	oh I have contributed a few things
 blackburn	not related with dim reduction
 Miggy	but ur last gsoc topic was dim reduction right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	it doesnt' matter what to implement in this interim period
 Miggy	so what algos have u implemented
 blackburn	I improved KNN
 blackburn	and implemented gaussian naive bayes
 blackburn	and some evaluations stuff
 blackburn	many fixes
 Miggy	this was before starting of the main project right?
 blackburn	yes
 Miggy	but i wanted to know abt ur main project
 Miggy	how did u manage time n all
 Miggy	what did u implement
 Miggy	so that i can get an idea
 blackburn	http://shogun-toolbox.org/edrt/
 blackburn	12 algos during May-December or so
 Miggy	great let me check
 blackburn	sorry I have to go now

 blackburn	don't forget to contact your possible mentor
 kp	hi
 kp	i am a gsoc applicant
 kp	and i am interested in the project which aims to integrate C5.0
 kp	whom do i have to interact with regarding that?
 n4nd0	kp: have you checked who is the mentor of that project?
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.227.100] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 kp	yes...its Soren Sonnenburg
 n4nd0	kp: he's probably the person you should interact with
 n4nd0	kp: you should either try to mail him or to talk to him here then, sonney2k
 kp	oh thanks...
 kp	<sonney2k>: Hi. I am karthik and i am very interested in the "integrating c5.0" algorithm.
 kp	i am comforatble with c++.
 kp	i have also undertaken a course on machine learning and data mining.
 kp	it would very helpful if you could let me know about the specific requirements so that i can write my proposal auitably
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 n4nd0	kp: in general, for any proposal, this year it's a requirement to have done a mall patch for the project
 n4nd0	kp: I'd recommend you to fork the project in github and get the code locally and start playing with it a bit
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 kp	alright...thanks a million, I'll try doing that right away...
 n4nd0	kp: ask around here if have any problem ;)

 harshit_	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	harshit_: hey man! how is it going?
 harshit_	going good bro ..
 harshit_	hey i have some issues related to github
 harshit_	will you be able to ans them
 n4nd0	I am not an expert, I have used it for some time now though
 n4nd0	just fire question and let's see if we can fix the issues
 harshit_	firstly i have deleted some directories in shogun/src/interfaces
 harshit_	so how to get them again from upstream
 harshit_	Do i need to fork again ?
 n4nd0	harshit_: no, at first sight it shouldn't be necesssary
 n4nd0	but why did you do that?
 n4nd0	I mean, it is good to know if you changed something there
 harshit_	i didnt do that intensionally
 harshit_	Actually main problem was that i sent a pull request
 harshit_	in which *.i~
 harshit_	and *.cpp~
 harshit_	files were also pushed along with *.cpp files
 blackburn	git checkout dir
 n4nd0	ok, I see
 n4nd0	so I'd say that if you pull the repo the main repo it should be fixed
 harshit_	blackburn, i need to use it by being in the shogun directory ?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	use git status
-!- pythonroar [d2198538@gateway/web/freenode/ip.210.25.133.56] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 blackburn	to check for modifications
 harshit_	have a look at my pull request :
 blackburn	and git checkout to reset status
 blackburn	I glanced over it but will take a closer look a little bit later
 harshit_	okay but be please be here while i am doing git stuff
 harshit_	blackburn when i do git status, a bunch of deleted files and untracked files are displayed
 harshit_	and git checkout shows some files along with D
 n4nd0	git checkout <name of the deleted files>
 blackburn	git checkout path-to-dir
 blackburn	or path-to-file
-!- pluskid [~chatzilla@60.191.2.230] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	Hey blackburn and n4nd0 there is an error coming :
 harshit_	 git checkout /home/harshit/github/shogun/src/interfaces/error: pathspec 'src/interfaces' did not match any file(s) known to git.
 harshit_	sorry error is :   error: pathspec 'src/interfaces' did not match any file(s) known to git.
 blackburn	you may use relative paths btw
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 harshit_	i did bt it didnt worked either
 n4nd0	if you go the directory shogun/src for example
 n4nd0	do
 n4nd0	git checkout interfaces
 n4nd0	what does that tell you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh what a cute reversed ?
 harshit_	same error
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha spanish keyboard ... we do ?! and ??
 harshit_	btw is there any initiation or something required for github that i am missing
 blackburn	yeah I know
 pluskid	BTW: how many GSoC student slots do you have this year?
 blackburn	harshit_: that's pretty strange error
 blackburn	pluskid: lets denote it by X
 blackburn	:D
 harshit_	i think i should fork it again.
 blackburn	we will know in april only
 pluskid	blackburn: OK
 harshit_	and do every other thing from starting
 blackburn	IIRC it is announced in the interim period
 pluskid	OK, I see
 n4nd0	harshit_: what steps did you follow when you forked the repo?
 n4nd0	harshit_: these are the normal ones http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
 harshit_	all the steps mentioned in the github website,
 harshit_	first 3 ones
 n4nd0	harshit_: mmm idk, I don't understand why 'src/interfaces' did not match any file(s) known to git.
 harshit_	i think i can clone it to some other location in my machine and then do all changes tehre
 n4nd0	harshit_: ok, try to do that then
 harshit_	btw what is this checkout used for ?
 harshit_	and do any one have any sort of cheatsheet or small manual for github commands
 n4nd0	http://book.git-scm.com/ is for me the best reference
 n4nd0	you may check also some things with man
 n4nd0	man git checkout for example
 harshit_	looks nice
 harshit_	thanks
 n4nd0	git help is also useful when memory fails :P
 harshit_	: )
 harshit_	Done :) every thing is working now
 harshit_	thanks n4nd0 and blackburn
 n4nd0	you are welcome
