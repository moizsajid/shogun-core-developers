 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8381b60 / src/configure : at least on debian based systems ruby libs are named libruby<VER>*.so* - http://bit.ly/lqKxF4
 serialhex	sonney2k, i'm updating my shogun now, will test the ruby_modular interface when it's built
 serialhex	fscking slow-ass computer!!!
 serialhex	sonney2k, my ruby doesn't work with your change, so we'll have to find a medium somewhere in between, it gives me a '/usr/bin/ld cant find -lruby1.8' error (i'm trying different configs & stuff and lost the exact msg, but i'll post it when i try that again)
 serialhex	also, i was having trouble loading modules, and i came across this: http://goo.gl/sHdbK and i went into each of the modules.  like it says, %module names should be lowercase, and since all of the modules (classifying, clustering, distance, etc...) are capitalized, we should do some non-break-backwards-compatibility thing like add either a test to see whether  we're compiling ruby or not in the Foo.i file, or in the ruby
 serialhex	compile opt include the "-module foo" the first is probably easier & more direct
 serialhex	my days have recently gotten very busy, as i *just* got a job (yay me!) so while i have some ideas on how to fix this stuff i might not get the time to actually do so...
 serialhex	...and i just noticed sploving is on!
 serialhex	...well, afk actually :P
 serialhex	and i *really* wish my computer was faster, 20+ min to compile shogun is just sad!  but i got to sleep, so i'll see what i can find out tomorrow, and let sploving & sonney2k know what i find... take care!
@sonney2k	serialhex, congrats on the job!
@sonney2k	serialhex, I am doing the conditional rename for ruby now
@sonney2k	serialhex, regarding configure - we will need a test to compile a minimal ruby extension? do you have an example for that?

 blackburn	ehh.. CMath::display_matrix is column major routine
 blackburn	sonney2k: why it is?
 blackburn	omg these matrices is rotating in LLE all the time
 blackburn	damn it

 blackburn	sonney2k: reported ;)
@bettyboo	;>
@sonney2k	blackburn, all matrices are assumed to be column by column
@sonney2k	that is the fortran way (tm)
@sonney2k	blackburn, thnanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: I had a problem with set_feature_matrix
 blackburn	well I have eigenvectors as ROWS of matrix
 blackburn	then I have to choose m of them
 blackburn	and columns of that matrix is feature matrix
 blackburn	everything seems to be ok, right?
 blackburn	but when I set this feature matrix and print it in python - I have eh.. something like transposed
 blackburn	right sizes - but not that order I think
@sonney2k	blackburn, it could of course be that I introduced bugs in the new typemaps
@sonney2k	it should be like 1 column == 1 vector
 blackburn	for the moment I just i<->j
 blackburn	I don't know exactly
 blackburn	these matrix issues makes me mad
@sonney2k	and matrix == mulltiple columns concatenated
@sonney2k	does that match your assumption
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	if so try to set a feature matrix and get it afterwards
 blackburn	in python?
@sonney2k	then you will see if it is still the same
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen pics in my report? looks like it doing the things right, but again I'm not confident with it
 blackburn	anyway the possible 'error' could be only in this issue - changing feature matrix
@sonney2k	blackburn, I suggest to sleep one night over this and then check again
@sonney2k	I don't know...
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, I assume code maintainability is more important than slight increase in performance.
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, depends...
 alesis-novik	As in using Gaussian class with GMM instead of having means and covariances in the GMM class itself
@sonney2k	usually yes though
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, how does having them in the gaussian class possibly slow down things?
@sonney2k	I would keep them there...
 alesis-novik	Well, moving stuff around will take a bit of time, but like I said, nothing major. Will need to completely redo the Gaussian code though.
 alesis-novik	But since Gaussian isn't used anywhere else as far as I know, it won't cause any problems
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, don't you have covariance matrix / mean vector in gaussian too? what else is missing?
 alesis-novik	yeah, but I need to represent the covariance depending on the type used (as svd or diagonal or spherical).
 alesis-novik	So the covariance field is effectively gone
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you remind me the name of a tool for compile caching?
 serialhex	hey blackburn, i think it's cmake
 blackburn	hi, serialhex
 serialhex	(i know, i'm like a half hour after the Q but whatev! i just got homw :P )
 serialhex	how are ya?
 blackburn	fine, but sitting at home all day long and having a sexual time with some dim reduction things :D
 blackburn	and you?
 serialhex	really?  you're having sex with some dim reduction stuff?? :P
 serialhex	i'm doing well, just got done with my last day of training for my new job!!!
* serialhex sees blackburn's spiffy 3d graph!!!
 blackburn	what is your new job?
 blackburn	serialhex: yeah it could show that method is working
 blackburn	or not
 blackburn	I don't know :D
 blackburn	I have to check if neighborhood is 'saved' in 2d
 blackburn	damn borg book about MDS have 612 pages
 serialhex	yeah, that souds like it might work
 serialhex	DAMN!!!
 blackburn	seems they have wrote almost everything that they know
 serialhex	well my new job is really kind of cool, i'm selling really spiffy high quality knives!!
 serialhex	yes it does!
 blackburn	selling knives sounds very profitable
 serialhex	i sometimes dont like books like that because theres no "this is what you *REALLY REALLY* need to know about this stuff" section in the beginning... so you dont have to grok the whole book
 blackburn	at least you can threat someone with your goods :D
 serialhex	but still, it looks impressive on a shelf!! :D
 serialhex	oh yeah!!
 blackburn	'damn man i'll show you how sharp it is' :D
 blackburn	hrshsh
 serialhex	dude, you've probably never dealt with a cocanut in russia, but while i was in jamaica i had one and it took the dude 3 whacks with a machete to break open the sucker!
 blackburn	hehe
 serialhex	with the cleaver that my boss (whos really hot and really awesome) let me use, i split that thing in HALF with one swing!!!
 serialhex	it was freaking awesome!!!
 serialhex	so yeah, i think it's going to be a lot of fun and probably very profitable!
 blackburn	nice to you :)
 serialhex	tho i'm still working on some of the ruby things, but i gotta make it work first!! :(
@sonney2k	serialhex, I hope you can recommend me a good knive now :)
 serialhex	hellz yeah!!!  i can probably sell em to ya if you like, they're really spiffy!!!
@sonney2k	all the ones I have here are just blunt
@sonney2k	serialhex, made in germany ;-)
 serialhex	well i'm not 100% sure if it'll work outside the US but they have a forever guarantee so you can get them sharpened whenever for the price of shipping
 serialhex	theres a lot more to em, but i'll talk to my manager and see what i can do :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: at least you have good cars :D
@bettyboo	lolomat
 serialhex	yes indeed!!  german cars rock!!!
 serialhex	anyway, i'm going to work on a ruby example tonight, and some more probably sunday a bit, tho it's still not compiling for me
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am riding a bike carrying to kids now
@sonney2k	in some kind of trailer
 serialhex	HAHAHA!!!
@sonney2k	serialhex, yeah we need a test
 serialhex	having fun sonney2k??
@sonney2k	serialhex, sure
@sonney2k	serialhex, some minimal ruby extension test...
 serialhex	do you want something that loads up all the modules?
@sonney2k	if you have that we could really check if things compile
 serialhex	ok, i'll see what i can cook up
@sonney2k	serialhex, ahh and btw, I tried lowercasing all module names but then the swig wrapped stuff stopped to work completely
@sonney2k	I couldn't import e.g. features nor Features
 serialhex	hmm... thats odd...
@sonney2k	err require
@sonney2k	serialhex, not sure if this is related to a pre 2.0 swig version here
 serialhex	well i couldnt do that before either
 serialhex	idk...
* serialhex should probably find his old copy of vmware and install it
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, I am not an expert in GMM - EM so ask vojtech what he thinks what is better
 serialhex	i also can't link it with the -lruby1.8 thing, i'll gist my error msg now...
@sonney2k	serialhex, just edit .config an replace the -lruby1.8 with -lruby
@sonney2k	(occurs twice)
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, I think this is more an aesthetic issue than anything else
 serialhex	ok... i'll do that for now then
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, I just don't know what EM for GMM will involve
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you heard about some dim reduction for strings? just recalled that shogun is highly biased to it :)
 alesis-novik	ok, I'll ask Vojtech for his opinion
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, in the end vojtech and you decide what is reasonable - only if the code later looks really weird I will give comments :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, nope ... well if they are kernel based then I guess you can use kpca
@sonney2k	blackburn, and shogun is not *that* biased towards strings
 blackburn	I just thinking about what to add to my project
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, well, that's one point of writing this software: making it readable and manageable :)
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, whatever you like :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I would love to do the CClassifier -> CMachine rename
@sonney2k	any objections?
 blackburn	it takes no difference for me
 blackburn	but sounds better, yes
 blackburn	my worries is related to preproc 'framework'
@sonney2k	blackburn, in which sense?
@sonney2k	btw, serialhex we have one module name PreProc
 serialhex	ok
 blackburn	as I said earlier, mds and lle doesn't make sense at 'learning'
@sonney2k	I guess that should then at least be called just Preprocessors
 serialhex	ok, sounds good
 blackburn	so init() in preproc and apply_to_feature_matrix() doesn't make sense at all
 blackburn	calling init for one feature matrix and apply to another - makes no useful embedding
 blackburn	*be back in 10 minutes
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't see a problem
@sonney2k	blackburn, you just don't do anything in init()
@sonney2k	and always do the embedding in apply*
@sonney2k	to the current fm
@sonney2k	serialhex, ok will rename it then
 serialhex	oh, sonney2k, how were you doing the %module renaming?  something like #ifdef SWIGRUBY; %module foo; #endif; ??
@sonney2k	serialhex, yes
 serialhex	ok, i'll test that out then sonney2k, and see how it works on my end
@sonney2k	serialhex, this is the patch https://gist.github.com/997253
 serialhex	sweet!!!  thanks sonney2k, i'm compiling now but i'll get this applied once it's done (and recompile :P )
@sonney2k	serialhex, blackburn: shall I name the PreProc module Preprocessor or Preprocessors?
@sonney2k	I tend towards Preprocessor
 serialhex	that works for me
 blackburn	sonney2k: hehe i don't understand why I didn't choose this way (with do nothing in init)
@sonney2k	brain twists...
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we really need 'pre'?
 blackburn	Preprocessor is better for me
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean Processor?
@sonney2k	nah
 blackburn	may be
 blackburn	but it sounds not so 'sensefully', I agree now :)
@sonney2k	should I also rename the preproc dir to preprocessor ?
@sonney2k	and the PreProc class to Preprocessor?
 blackburn	makes sense
@sonney2k	doing ...
 blackburn	PreProc is strange camel case
 blackburn	caught an error a few times because of Preproc<->PreProc
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think in preproc there should be a class for dim.reduction :)
 blackburn	may be I'll add one later
 blackburn	does it makes sense to you?
 blackburn	anyway I'm going to bed now, tomorrow will be learning some shity game theory and so on, damn exams
 blackburn	see you
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.4.77] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@sonney2k	best of luck...
