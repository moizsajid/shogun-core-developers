 mikeling	hi, does anyone online?
 mikeling	it says "Test suite for meta examples does not exist! Please initialise and/or  update the data submodule." when I try to run cmake -DBUILD_META_EXAMPLES=ON -DDEBUG=ON ../
-!- abhinav [~abhinav@103.68.217.96] has joined #shogun
@wiking	yes
@wiking	mikeling, first do: git submodule init && git submodule update
@wiking	in the cloned repo
 mikeling	wiking: oh great! It works, thank you :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: !
 lisitsyn	wiking: any idea about shogun.ml? :)

 mikeling	lisitsyn: wiking How to relate label with feature? I mean when we train the knn in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/meta/src/multiclass_classifier/knn.sg How could we know the  feature's label?
 mikeling	Because they are been training separately
-!- abhinav [~abhinav@103.68.217.96] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 lisitsyn	mikeling: by the order
 mikeling	lisitsyn: so the first feature will correspond to the first label and the second label with second feature and so on?
 lisitsyn	mikeling: the correspondence is between feature vector and label
 lisitsyn	you have arbitrary number of features
 lisitsyn	but the number of labels and the number of vectors are the same
 mikeling	lisitsyn: oh, so one feature could including numbers of vectors and one vector have only one label
 mikeling	lisitsyn: I got an error when I remake the whole src code https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8961555
 mikeling	I have no idea why it happened even after I google it
 CaBa	wiking: welcome back!
 CaBa	sonney2k: ping
