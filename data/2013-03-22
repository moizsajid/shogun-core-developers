 n4nd0	sonney2k: there you go
 n4nd0	take a look please
@sonney2k	much better already
-!- zxtx [~zv@c-67-188-178-73.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0, this is also stupid: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/downloads
@sonney2k	any idea where this should go?
 n4nd0	what do you find stupid?
 n4nd0	that Source code, MD5, etc is repeated thousand times or the place where it appears
@sonney2k	n4nd0, downloads are under documentation
@sonney2k	that simply doesn't fit there
@sonney2k	ohh and the FAQ should be under documentation too
@sonney2k	could you do that?
 n4nd0	what about changing DEV -> CODE
 n4nd0	and put downloads as a subpage there
@sonney2k	hmm dev was meant to be developer resources/information
@sonney2k	it might better fit under documentation though
@sonney2k	now that we have subpages
@sonney2k	then somehow news and planet should be under one thing
 n4nd0	sonney2k: FAQ is under documentation now
@sonney2k	and I dont' know but I would expect a separate download button
 n4nd0	under about :)
@sonney2k	not news like we call it
@sonney2k	argh
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you mean with a separate download button?
@sonney2k	other toolboxes usually have
 n4nd0	like download now on the home page directly downloads it?
@sonney2k	about, documentation, contact, download
 n4nd0	aham I see
@sonney2k	our news == downloads in fact
@sonney2k	a bit weird
 n4nd0	hehe yeah
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please put FAQ to the very right
 n4nd0	let's see how that is done :D
 n4nd0	I guess sort order
 n4nd0	but no idea really
@sonney2k	n4nd0, look at http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/ourteam -isn't that a weird page
@sonney2k	no pictures no nothing
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes sort order
@sonney2k	just put a 4 there
@sonney2k	just a few names
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, that page is really poor
 n4nd0	we need something there
 n4nd0	look at my friend's website
 n4nd0	http://erlerobot.com/blog/equipo/?lang=en
 n4nd0	something like that would be cool
 n4nd0	well the special effects for the pictures are not needed..
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah exactly sth like that
@sonney2k	n4nd0, coudl you please move dev also under documentation?
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	current subpages of dev as sub-subpages right?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is done now
 n4nd0	however DEV subpage is empty (because before it was a page and pages do not have articles, subpages have them)
 n4nd0	we should put something there so once you click on DEV you don't get a blank page below
 n4nd0	ok time to sleep now
 n4nd0	good nigth
 n4nd0	or night or whatever :)

 sonne|work	n4nd0: morning!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hello hello
 n4nd0	tell me
 sonne|work	n4nd0: what?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha ok I thought you wanted to tell me something :)
 n4nd0	about the webpage or so
 sonne|work	n4nd0: wellf or the website - how can we make the initial DEV page not to be blank?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: we have to associate it with an article
 sonne|work	then please do?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what about getting rid of the Getting Started below
 n4nd0	and put it on the initial DEV
 sonne|work	why can getting started not be shown as the initial DEV?
 sonne|work	it makes sense but do we have to remove the getting started?
 n4nd0	mm I am not sure we can redirect the initial DEV to getting started
 n4nd0	it is not the same relation between pages and subpages
 n4nd0	than between subpages and sub-subpages
 n4nd0	subpages are associated to articles
 n4nd0	to when you click on any subpage (independently from being sub-subpage or just subpage) an article is going to be shown
 sonne|work	yeah but why couldn't a sub-subpage be handled the same way?
 sonne|work	I don't understand this yet
 sonne|work	anyway I am fine with getting started for dev to appear first
 sonne|work	and I think we can rename dev to developer
 sonne|work	:)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it is looking better now
 n4nd0	I moved one of the articles in Getting started to the main DEV
 sonne|work	n4nd0: can we do the same with Information?
-!- zxtx [~zv@75-59-238-10.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	Information should be user documentation right?
 sonne|work	we could just show what we currently call links
 sonne|work	and other information also as sub-sub page
 n4nd0	we have actually two information :D
 sonne|work	It is all still too confusing :/
 sonne|work	We somehow need download
 sonne|work	under download one can find all the releases
 sonne|work	but where do we put source code git checkout stuff?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: where is that currently?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: regarding the current documentation/information, I would put it under documentation/developer in a new sub-subpage called API
 sonne|work	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/dev
 sonne|work	n4nd0: woudl you agree that we should put http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/samples under about/samples ?
 sonne|work	and under about/information better have all the our team etc as sub-subpages?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah
 sonne|work	let me move samples
 n4nd0	samples are not documentation indeed
 n4nd0	ok
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@dslb-092-078-043-137.pools.arcor-ip.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: you have to uncheck the box is topsubpage? in the subpage samples, put root page about
 n4nd0	and in the subpage information (inside page about) select samples as child subapge
 n4nd0	ah no wait
 n4nd0	we wanted samples as normal subpage in about
 sonne|work	I did sth but got internal server error
 n4nd0	nvm
 n4nd0	:/
 sonne|work	n4nd0: how do I move our team in about to become a subpage of information?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: uncheck is top subpage in our team subpage
 sonne|work	ahh ok
 n4nd0	and select is as child subpage in information
 n4nd0	yeah, that's it
 n4nd0	let's get rid of Documentation/Information
 n4nd0	I don't really like two Information subpages in about and Documentation
 sonne|work	n4nd0: what do you suggest?
 sonne|work	me neither
 sonne|work	but links is also not the correct term
 n4nd0	sonne|work: documentation/information goes do documentation/developer in a new sub-subpage called API
 n4nd0	we have there the link to doxygen
 n4nd0	so I think it is fine to call it API
 sonne|work	wait
 sonne|work	this page has lots of content not related to api
 sonne|work	I mean installation, screenshots, tutorial, examples ...
 sonne|work	that is not api
 n4nd0	true
 sonne|work	what would one expect when one clicks on documentation?
 sonne|work	IMHO
 sonne|work	Installation is one thing
 sonne|work	ok one step back even
 sonne|work	imagine you have no idea what shogun is
 sonne|work	what do you do
 sonne|work	you first go to the homepage
 sonne|work	browse the screenshots at the bottom
 sonne|work	and then maybe go to about
 sonne|work	so there we need some intro to what shogun is about, what is machine learning in general
 sonne|work	currently it is assumed that you already are a hardcore ML guy
 sonne|work	so about/information should give some mini ML info and then say what shogun is about / feature matrix strengths etc
 sonne|work	then when one is interested
 sonne|work	one would download that thing
 sonne|work	so we need some download knob
 sonne|work	and once downloaded I guess one would search how to install and use the thing
 sonne|work	documentation
 n4nd0	mmm I am not so sure if we should add mini intro to ML
 sonne|work	install
 sonne|work	so under documentation I would expect install
 sonne|work	and then some user documentation, developer docuemtnation
 sonne|work	tutorial
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well think of some dj3s & shogun based demo
 sonne|work	would be cool
 sonne|work	certainly nothing we do now / soon
 n4nd0	yeah that would be cool indeed
 sonne|work	n4nd0: for now we should just try to get the structure of the page OKish such that new students
 sonne|work	a) figure out what shogun is about
 sonne|work	b)  manage to download the source code / install it
 sonne|work	c) run some examples
 sonne|work	d) find the developer documentation and do some minimal stuff
 sonne|work	that is quite a lot already...
 n4nd0	mmm it might be
 n4nd0	sonne|work: can you add some of the changes in the structure you mentioned? I think you know better how it should look like
 n4nd0	then I can start filling in some missing info if needed
 sonne|work	I am just discussing
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am thinking about going to prague and then visit berlin by bus
 sonne|work	blackburn: then you can visit vojtech in prague :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: much easier to get to czech republic for me - quite popular route
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have friend from my city working for vojtech :)
 sonne|work	or him :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: BMRM thingy btw
 blackburn	or something similar
 blackburn	I'll push him to put it to shogun later
 sonne|work	heh
 blackburn	sonne|work: visa is pain in the ass
 blackburn	sonne|work: to get german visa I should either prepare all documents and visit consulate in moscow (that costs >300$ to just visit moscow) or pay ~200$ :D
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	crazy
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's a business to help with visas (second case)
 blackburn	sonne|work: first case is that I live in 'province' thus no german consulate for me around
 blackburn	sonne|work: ha it is just 300 km from prague to berlin
 blackburn	I go by bus each weekend for 100 km back and forth

 ZeThomas	hey, I have a question: I have a SVMLight object, trained and all, and I want, for a new feature vector x, to compute just the <w.x> + b
 ZeThomas	what's the simplest way of doing this?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: hey
 n4nd0	it looks like you should create a Features object and use apply
 blackburn	no not really
 n4nd0	sorry then :)
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes probably
 ZeThomas	but if I apply, it just gives me the label?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: yeah
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: so you want the actual score?
 ZeThomas	n4nd0, I want the specific value, not just its sign
 n4nd0	there should be something for that as well..
 ZeThomas	that's what I thought, but haven't found it yet..
 blackburn	ZeThomas: ahh you need confidence
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: what is the interface you are using?
 ZeThomas	modshogun, python
 n4nd0	in python it would be as easy as
 n4nd0	np.dot(svm.get_w(), x) + svm.get_bias()
 n4nd0	or something very similar to that
 blackburn	ZeThomas: try labels.get_values()
 blackburn	to get real-valued outputs
 ZeThomas	yes, but I don't find a get_w in my dir(svm)
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: what?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: n4nd0: yes there is no get_w in svmlight
 ZeThomas	n4nd0: AttributeError: 'SVMLight' object has no attribute 'get_w'
 blackburn	svmlight is a kernel method
 n4nd0	oh I see
 blackburn	there is a trick to get w - I can check it out - but in general if your problem is linear why to use kernel method, right? :)
 n4nd0	true hehe
 ZeThomas	I can compute the w from get_alphas and  get_support_vectors
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes of course
 blackburn	ZeThomas: or you could call get_w of linear kernel
 ZeThomas	blackburn, no I need the kernel
 blackburn	ZeThomas: alright - just call get_w on linear kernel if you need w, or labels.get_values() if you need real-valued output
 ZeThomas	but get_values() just gives me an array of 1. and -1., no?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: oh that should not happen - get_labels should return that
 blackburn	ZeThomas: it works here at least
 blackburn	:)
 ZeThomas	blackburn: oh, I see
 ZeThomas	that indeed solves my question, thanks so much
