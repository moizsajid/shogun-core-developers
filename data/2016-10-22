 sanuj	HeikoS, hey!
@HeikoS	sanuj: jojo
@HeikoS	wiking and me are having a hackathon in SF
@HeikoS	lots of things are going to be merged
@HeikoS	your stuff is on the list as well
@HeikoS	can you give us some heads up whats needed?
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	that's cool!
 sanuj	let me see
@HeikoS	we want to merge the new getter and setter stuff
@HeikoS	before release
@HeikoS	and potentially also integration with SG_ADD
@HeikoS	but lisitsyn needs to speak
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	lisitsyn, was doing SG_ADD
 sanuj	HeikoS, did you see the readmes i wrote?
@HeikoS	I did
@HeikoS	but better look again :)
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	HeikoS, swig stuff for setter/getter is still on feature/tags
@HeikoS	what blocks it from bein merged?

 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commits/feature/tags
 sanuj	that branch has plugins stuff also
 sanuj	next step is to write a shogun plugin using the plugin arch
 sanuj	that would probably lead to insights
 sanuj	what needs to be added
 sanuj	regarding swig stuff for setter/getter
 sanuj	there is a list which has shogun base classes
 sanuj	that list is incomplete

 CaBa	heya
 CaBa	HeikoS: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#weights_for_data_instances <- is there a frontent for this in shogun?
@HeikoS	I dont know
 CaBa	or a way to add weights to the training data in any way..
 CaBa	.oO(way too much ;))
@HeikoS	but I have the feeling no
@HeikoS	how is it done?
@HeikoS	I am sure it is easy to add that
@HeikoS	how do they do it?
@HeikoS	scaling the data?

@HeikoS	or somehow do something in the solver?
 CaBa	HeikoS: hard to say... i just found this website and neither the description nor the downloadable file say much about the "how" :P
@HeikoS	maybe download and check whats happening inside
@HeikoS	it might just scale things
@HeikoS	i.e. transform the input
@HeikoS	to libsvm
 CaBa	HeikoS: how would you scale things?
@HeikoS	input*scalar
 CaBa	input being feature vectors?

@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	or row/column of kernel matrix
 CaBa	HeikoS: hmm... intuitively... wouldn't that move things further away from the margin? those data points wouldn't play a major role anymore...
@HeikoS	my point is not: do that
@HeikoS	but my point is: check what they do :)
@HeikoS	if it is something like this, i.e. transforming the input, then it is easy
@HeikoS	if it changes the solver inside libsvm, it is a bit more work to add
