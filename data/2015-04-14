@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hey!
@HeikoS	how are things?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: fine, on vacations now
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool!
@HeikoS	shogun vacations? :)
 lisitsyn	I'd need some shakedown but I can try to make something good for shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what about the manual thing?
@HeikoS	its good to go now I guess?
@HeikoS	what do you think is the next steP?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I want to have a list of langs in one place
@HeikoS	meaning?
@HeikoS	languages
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: target languages yeah
@HeikoS	ideas how to do it?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet should check
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: as for the next step I don't know
 lisitsyn	may be integrate it into shogun..
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I agree
@HeikoS	next step would be to add structure
@HeikoS	in such way that all files are organised nicely
@HeikoS	and fit into shogun dir structure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: i.e. CMake, meta-language examples, dir-structure
@HeikoS	and then make manual
@HeikoS	"make manual"
@HeikoS	target
@HeikoS	in a way that we then can just start adding pages
@HeikoS	wanna give that a go?
 lisitsyn	yeah why not
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll start and then if I don't get bored it should be done :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: feature brnach a good idea?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: probably
 lisitsyn	I'll create one
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: check what esben did with the meta language examples
 lisitsyn	ok let me check
@HeikoS	he modified cmake in a clever way to translate and execute things
 lisitsyn	aha
 lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: some other next steps are
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: add more languages to meta examples
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: make the sphinx output pretty
@HeikoS	sphinx dependency for cmake
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: feel free to tackle all ofthem :)
 lisitsyn	haha yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I can help, just let me know where you are?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: should we maybe write a TODO list? of things in order?
 lisitsyn	lets create a github issue
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah and put list htere
 lisitsyn	don't we have something on that already?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we have too many issues :D
-!- kshitijk [~kshitijk@202.78.169.243] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 lisitsyn	oh there are too many issues for real
 lisitsyn	14 pages of open isseus :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats all good
@HeikoS	as we finally documenzted things
@HeikoS	took a while
@HeikoS	remember 4 years ago
@HeikoS	lots of problems, none documented
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: lets push the manual this week
@HeikoS	really excited about it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what are first 3 steps?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the more concrete the better
@HeikoS	otherwise one never starts as elephant task
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the way we did it so far was good with very mini sub-tasks
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: 1) all languages in one place
@HeikoS	Ill open an issue
@HeikoS	feel free to edit
 lisitsyn	both javascript and jinja
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: or you start, as you have it in mind already
@HeikoS	I will edit then
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2816
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: updated!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: updated more!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok cool thanks
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: feel free to divide into sub-tasks
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	for most of the points, first step would  be to think about how it can be done
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I also like the approach of just modifying the prototype we have
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: also trying to get back to piano :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hehe nice!
@HeikoS	how is it going?
 lisitsyn	oh well I learnt very very basic things
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but then I had this city transition and left it at home
 lisitsyn	gonna move it now and start trying again
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I feel I need someone to teach cause learning this by myself is much much harder
@HeikoS	yeah true
@HeikoS	take lessons
@HeikoS	thats the best
@HeikoS	even if you once a month

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: .container -> .container-fluid
 lisitsyn	as .container has width: 1170px
 lisitsyn	it was like very wide
