@sonney2k	lisitsyn, already having the option not to init memory is very helpful
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: if you realloc too much it may be a wrong data structure
@sonney2k	so in a loop where you fill an array anyway
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: reserve doesn't init memory
 lisitsyn	resize does reserve doesn't
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, sure but in cases you don't know how big the thing will be
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's for linked list right?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, for e.g a tree
 lisitsyn	why to store it in a vector?
@sonney2k	to save memory
@sonney2k	you only have one big memory block and indices into the nodes
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I wouldn't use vector for that then!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what else?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it is like when you write your own data structure
 lisitsyn	so you can put some manually controlled memory
 thoralf	sonney2k: examples from libshogun are working, but cmdline_static has 5 segfaulting tests...

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, sonney2k : PR alarm!
 thoralf	in distance_hammingword.sg
 lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	thoralf, that sounds like a change of Heiko
@sonney2k	I didn't do anything there
 thoralf	sonney2k: I'm putting away my old laptop now and get some sleep.
 thoralf	sonney2k: If you need more help, you need to wait until tomorrow after work.
@sonney2k	thoralf, no it is all good! thanks!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, whenever you see Heiko/wiking tell them we need tests back working or we will run into a nightmare mess
 lisitsyn	yeah
* sonney2k is finally entering the nips reviews
 thoralf	Guys, see you tomorrow.
 thoralf	Sorry, today. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf: good night!

@sonney2k	van51, hey there!
 van51	sonney2k: hello :)
@sonney2k	and hey foulwall !
@sonney2k	van51, so what would you want to do now?
-!- foulwall [~user@2001:da8:215:503:d2e:b5f1:ff20:a998] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 van51	sonney2k: hmm I think I could add support for quadratic features in the hashed sparse and dense classes
 van51	sonney2k: don't think it will take long
@sonney2k	van51, it would be could if you could continue the dotfeatures hacking spree doing things like the random fourier features and lbppyrfeatures etc
@sonney2k	van51, I finally finished nips reviews and so I can use my spare time for shogun stuff
 van51	sonney2k: nice :)
 van51	sonney2k: well I can also continue with those and wait if Benoir or Olivier have another suggestion for extension or something
-!- thoralf [~thoralf@enki.zib.de] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	Heyho.
 van51	sonney2k: btw on another note, for the GSoC we are supposed to submit some answers about our mentor
 van51	sonney2k: I have three mentors now I think. Who is supposed to be the official one?
@sonney2k	van51, we are one entity
@sonney2k	van51, and we are happy with what you are doing so no worries either
 van51	sonney2k: ok then :)
@sonney2k	van51, btw what n-gram length did you use in the webspam thing?
 van51	sonney2k: size 8
@sonney2k	ahh ok that explains the good performance
 van51	sonney2k: do you want me to try with size=3?
@sonney2k	van51, and the experiment was with preprocessing>
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	or with the dot features?
 van51	sonney2k: no everything was on the fly
 van51	sonney2k: with dot features
@sonney2k	so dot
@sonney2k	but not streaming right?
 van51	sonney2k: nope, because the current streaming classes read line by line
 van51	sonney2k: instead of delimiting on \0 eg
@sonney2k	as in '\n' as separator
@sonney2k	yes o
@sonney2k	k
 van51	sonney2k: do you want me to try a different setting?
 van51	sonney2k: I run it on another machine so I won't mind
@sonney2k	did you compare with the results I had in my paper?
@sonney2k	van51, btw how much memory do 100k examples take?
 van51	sonney2k: I haven't checked that. I know that it crashes on 150k examples
@sonney2k	http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/publications/SonRaeRie07.pdf
@sonney2k	table 4.4
@sonney2k	look at the training time
@sonney2k	107661 seconds
@sonney2k	for 100k
@sonney2k	auROC 99.64%
 van51	sonney2k: well it's much faster and for a high number of bits in the hash seems to perform better
@sonney2k	van51, what did you have?
 van51	for eg 16 bits in hash
@sonney2k	van51, I don't have my tomtom mail here so I cannot check
 van51	sonney2k: it took 11044 seconds and had a auROC of 0.998183
@sonney2k	van51, it is a weird that it is better
@sonney2k	should be the same result
@sonney2k	10 times faster it seems - which is good
@sonney2k	van51, would be interesting to see the result when you use the converter in a preprocessing step - with same sqrt normalization
@sonney2k	van51, was that liblinear or svmocas btw?
 van51	sonney2k: svmocas
@sonney2k	epsilon default?
 van51	sonney2k: yeap and C=0.01
 van51	sonney2k: I have the code here https://gist.github.com/van51/5938097 if you want to check it for anything I missed
@sonney2k	van51, that explains it
@sonney2k	van51, I had C=1 in the experiment
 van51	sonney2k: and you had used  tri-grams?
@sonney2k	van51, so C=0.01 seems to be a better choice
@sonney2k	no 8-grams
 van51	sonney2k: ah
 van51	sonney2k: do you want to compare in the same settings?
@sonney2k	van51, you could pick e.g. 5k examples and compare
@sonney2k	but I think it is alright
 van51	sonney2k: ok I will, just to be thorough :D
 van51	sonney2k: so about what's next, what do you suggest? quadratic or randomfourier/lbppyr ?
@sonney2k	van51, quadratic is easy to do and very useful so it is good if you do that too. I don't know how to properly stack things though :/
@sonney2k	I mean consider that you have n-gram's and want to use quadratic on top
@sonney2k	no idea how this could work in a general framework
@sonney2k	so for now dense/sparse is OK
 van51	sonney2k: and the user would specify the indices to be paired?
@sonney2k	I have no masterplan
@sonney2k	I would say for now do the comparison with C=1 on 5k examples and the quadratic features for dense and sparse
@sonney2k	maybe sth comes to our mind in the meantime
 van51	sonney2k: ok, just one question about the quadratic features
@sonney2k	van51, btw for dense specifying which pairs should be quadratic is likely a good idea to do (sometimes)
 van51	sonney2k: if I'm not mistaken in vw the user specifies the namespaces to be pired
@sonney2k	and for quadratic features it makes sense to keep also the linear terms (at least optional
@sonney2k	)
 van51	sonney2k: what's the alternative? to brute-force all possible pairs?
@sonney2k	so you have the x_1,...x_D and x_1*x_1,x_1*x_2...x_1*x_D, x_2*x_2...x_2*x_D...
@sonney2k	yes exactly
@sonney2k	for dense that is simply 2 nested for loops
@sonney2k	for sparse you do that only over the available dims
 van51	sonney2k: ok got it
 van51	sonney2k: will get right on it
@sonney2k	so for high sparsitye & sparse it is cheap for dense not so
@sonney2k	but at least you don't need to store D^2 many features in memory
@sonney2k	van51, btw you could compare it with the result of a polynomial kernel svm on some toy data if you use the factors 2*x_1*x_2 for cross terms
@sonney2k	which you in the final version can just leave out
@sonney2k	they are not doing any good but are a necessary evil when using kernels
@sonney2k	so the polykernel cannot do w/o them
@sonney2k	van51, questions so far?
 van51	sonney2k: I don't think so
@sonney2k	if not I will swim a few km now
 van51	sonney2k: if something comes up, I'll bug you again later
 van51	sonney2k: nice, hopefully by the end of the week i'll be swimming as well :D
 van51	sonney2k: although I don't think I can last that much, more like 50m :p
@sonney2k	van51, heh weather is nice today no wind no clouds just calm sea
@sonney2k	and water is cold which makes me swim fast
@sonney2k	alrighty
@sonney2k	enough
@sonney2k	water here I come
 van51	sonney2k: enjoy then!
* sonney2k off

 thoralf	Hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	thoralfhi! :)
@HeikoS	lambday:  hi!
@HeikoS	thoralf: sorry did not yet have time to write the automated testing thing down but will soon! :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: sonney2k told us, if you get to the channel, please try to fix travis. ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: yes, will do today
 thoralf	told us to tell you
@HeikoS	thoralf: thanks! :)
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things?
 lambday	HeikoS: a bit slow this weekend.. :(
@HeikoS	lambday: any particular issues?
 lambday	HeikoS: hopefully I'll finish COCG_M by tonight
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, good to hear. what about the triangular solver?
 lambday	HeikoS: no just got occupied with a few other things :(
 lambday	HeikoS: well, turns out that alglib actually uses lapack for that particular thing
@HeikoS	lambday: I see well we are pretty good in schedule
@HeikoS	lambday: I see, mmh
@HeikoS	lambday: what about eigen3 again?
@HeikoS	I dont like lapack so much
 lambday	HeikoS: eigen3 I guess don't have that
@HeikoS	lambday: it IS in there, but not exposed in a nice way
@HeikoS	which is annoying
 lambday	HeikoS: not exposed as in?
@HeikoS	lambday: cannot access it easily
 lambday	okay
 lambday	but shall I try to study that instead of incorporating lapack routine?
-!- iglesiasg [~iglesias@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@HeikoS	lambday: how for advanced are you with that?
 lambday	with the lapack?
@HeikoS	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TutorialSparse.html#TutorialSparseDirectSolvers
@HeikoS	Just as with dense matrices, the triangularView() function can be used to address a triangular part of the matrix, and perform triangular solves with a dense right hand side:
@HeikoS	isnt that helpful?
 lambday	HeikoS: can we set the subdiagonals in sparse easily?
@HeikoS	lambday: dont know ...
 lambday	well, for lanczos, the system is not that huge
 lambday	we can use dense things
@HeikoS	lambday: yes before I meant how much of the lapack/alglib integration have you done
 lambday	HeikoS: not started with that yet, was working on COCG_M
@HeikoS	lambday: okay good,
@HeikoS	so its worth thinking about it
@HeikoS	for what do you need the triangular exactly again?
 lambday	for lanczos, it sets the diagonal of a matrix from some values generated in its cg iterations
 lambday	so, its not that huge
 lambday	HeikoS: can we think about importing readymade Lanczos implementation from somewhere?
 lambday	HeikoS: well, that would create another dependency.. CG things are pretty much same
@HeikoS	lambday: would be good, but also sounds painful ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: so erlend spent quite some time on alglib design
@HeikoS	maybe its a good idea just to make it the same
 lambday	HeikoS: well, krylstat simply uses alglib routine for solving the tridiagonal system.. we have to import that method in shogun if we wanna do the same
 lambday	HeikoS:
 lambday	https://github.com/lambday/KRYLSTAT/blob/master/lanczos/eigen/eigen_lanczos.h#L111
@HeikoS	lambday: we are already depending on lapack
@HeikoS	and the I ported quite a few alglib routines already, its a bit work but not hard to to and doesnt create dependencies
 lambday	HeikoS: I was taking a look.. they use quite a few internal data structures which I gotta check how they works... plus they say that they imported that particular routine from lapack
@HeikoS	lambday: oh ....
 lambday	I was then having a look at our lapack.h
 lambday	if that was already there..
 lambday	but I didn't get how our lapack works
@HeikoS	lambday: ha, through chaos :D
 lambday	hehe :D
@HeikoS	ok, we should check this out a bit more then, I wil lhave lunch now and then be back, will you be around a bit longer?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes I am here
@HeikoS	lambday: ok cool
 lambday	HeikoS: enjoy your meal :)
@HeikoS	lambday: ah btw
@HeikoS	http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5302
 lambday	HeikoS: this is another paper? :D
@HeikoS	lambday: yes thats the nips kernel sampler
 lambday	awesome!!!
@HeikoS	lambday: nice pictures in there ;)
@HeikoS	ok going now, see you later

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	loa hi
@HeikoS	lambday:  hi
 lambday	HeikoS: so in the Lanczos, we form this T matrix.. whose dimension is nxn, n=number of cg iteration...
 lambday	HeikoS: now, I can treat that as a dense matrix and run a self adjoint eigen solver
 lambday	because, eigen3 has this tridiagonalization thing... but I don't know if I can use that for solving eigenvalue problems
@HeikoS	lambday: it *is* in fact dense richt?
 lambday	HeikoS: its tridiagonal...
 lambday	HeikoS: not so dense
@HeikoS	lambday: ah
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	that would only work for a few thousand iterations then
@HeikoS	so not so good
 lambday	yep :(
 lambday	I guess that's why erlend used particular method for tridiagonal specifically
 lambday	which is not aparently there in eigen3
@HeikoS	lambday: I guess so
@HeikoS	lambday: lets maybe discuss with him?
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	lambday: could you write an email, summarise the problem and possible solutions?
@HeikoS	maybe he has some new insights
@HeikoS	lambday:  how long do you think until the rest is finished and we need this?
 lisitsyn	 I heard Lanczos
 lisitsyn	I have highlight on this word lol
 lambday	HeikoS: this is for the extremal eigenvalues... so even if our COCG_M works, we can't approximate logdet until we have this module working
 lambday	I planned to finish it within next week
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
 lambday	and then move on towards graph coloring things cause the rest of the stuffs will be almost ready
@HeikoS	lambday: : might be good to ask sergey :)

@sonney2k	HeikoS, any plans to get the tests back to greeeen?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes will do that later today
@HeikoS	sorry for having broken them for so long
@HeikoS	already spent so much time on fixing that I had to do some other things I postponed ;)
@HeikoS	NIPS review is coming soon and we have to prepare stuff for that
@HeikoS	sonney2k: btw http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5302
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ^
 lisitsyn	HeikoS:
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well the alternative is to blacklist all failing tests
@HeikoS	sonney2k: nono, I am sure I can fix them soon
@sonney2k	HeikoS, thoralf yesterday figured out that we have some failing examples in static interfaces
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so these might be due to some fixes in the GUI* classes
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I hope that wasnt me touching the GUI
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah damn
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok will have a look into them
@sonney2k	HeikoS, could be :P
@HeikoS	which language?
 thoralf	HeikoS: cmdline_static
@HeikoS	sonney2k: buildbot should tell that right?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well get the tests back to work and we will see anyway
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the buildbot doesn't build the rest if already libshogun & tests fail
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah
@HeikoS	damn
@sonney2k	HeikoS, btw I want to get rid of the get_feature_type / get_feature_class / get_kernel_type and all these ENUMS
@HeikoS	so that slipped through
 iglesiasg__	sonney2k, HeikoS, thoralf: and what's with travis clang and c++11?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok I will work on it soon
@sonney2k	iglesiasg__, is clang not supporting c++11? What do you mean?
 iglesiasg__	sonney2k, let me show you
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ahh and maybe important to I added a check to detect c++11
@sonney2k	HeikoS, if available we use atomic<int> for locking in SGReferencedData (this has 0 memory overhead!!)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: work in the shogun namespace even in the .cpp file for templated classes
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, indeed
@HeikoS	lambday: nice thanks, lets see what they say ,we still got some days until COCG is finished
 lambday	HeikoS: yes :)
 lambday	HeikoS: by the way, so the stuffs left as of now are 1)COCG_M 2) Lanczos and 3) probing vectors, right?
 lambday	and preconditioned CG
@HeikoS	lambday: yes
@HeikoS	pretty much
@HeikoS	probing will be some work
@HeikoS	too :)
@HeikoS	so thats the hardest parts of the project
@HeikoS	after that, we will spend some time on testing and documenting
@HeikoS	maybe even write some static interfaces as long as the R-bindings do not properly work
 lambday	alright :)
 lambday	HeikoS: well one thing... how much accuracy can we expect using Gaussian samples by the way?
 lambday	HeikoS: have you noticed anything in particular?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hopefully fixed...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yes, let's see
@HeikoS	lambday: well in the limit, 100%
@HeikoS	and with finite samples, I have no idea ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: why?
 lambday	HeikoS: just trying to get an idea whether I should get depressed when I write the unit-tests next week and it turns out to be not so accurate :(
@HeikoS	lambday: ah, no dont worry
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact, we should not unit test the accuracy too much
@HeikoS	rather use all basis vectors
@HeikoS	to get the exact trace
@HeikoS	lambday: the tests should not take too long
@sonney2k	lambday, ohh you have seen the picture of us? Are you as shocked as I am how tall HeikoS is?
@sonney2k	Gunnar must have felt puny!
@HeikoS	everyone should be shocked! ;)
* sonney2k already did
 lambday	sonney2k: lol you are tall too :-o
 lambday	HeikoS: you're 6'4"??
@HeikoS	lambday: 2meters
@sonney2k	10cm less
* sonney2k ^
 lambday	errr... :D
@sonney2k	lambday, competition is not good sometimes ;)
@HeikoS	tall people are awesome, as we always say in the boxing gym >:o
 lambday	haha :D
@iglesiasg	I felt I was a dwarf next to you guys in Berlin :(
 lambday	iglesiasg: I'd have too :(
 lambday	iglesiasg: average Indian guy :(
@iglesiasg	lambday, hehe how long is that? I am 1.73

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I was missing that! :)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: That's good european average :)
 lambday	iglesiasg: well, 5'7"
 lambday	so, that too is around 1.72 I guess
@iglesiasg	lambday, pretty much the same as me then :)
 lambday	iglesiasg: brother :D
@iglesiasg	thoralf, well living in Sweden and after my visit to Berlin, I think I am below the average :P
@iglesiasg	but when I get to the subway in Madrid, that feeling changes
@sonney2k	lambday, if we organize sth next year maybe you can come :)

 gsomix	lisitsyn, http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120922121059/lotr/images/c/c4/Balin_-_The_Hobbit.PNG
 gsomix	you need a beard
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I don't remember, am I taller?
 lambday	HeikoS: regarding COCG_M, I have a problem and a solution
 lambday	HeikoS: its tough to get all the solution vectors to be returned by our solve method, because the linear operator is real, the vector is real but just because of the complex shifts the solution is complex
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think you are taller than me yeah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I am about 173cm
 lambday	HeikoS: so I can't extend the base properly and its hard to fit in the system.. but I want to keep the base same (CLinearSolver)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I am around that too
 lisitsyn	but 2x of you anyway
 lisitsyn	haha
@iglesiasg	:P
 lambday	HeikoS: so, I am planning to add another level of abstraction - extending CIterativeLinearSolver (subclass of CLinearSolver) to CLinearShiftedFamilySolver... where shifts can be real/complex (templated)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: in other dimension
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	HeikoS: then, in COCG_M implementation of that, solve just returns the basic solution (similar to what Krylstat does)
 lambday	HeikoS: and there will be two abstract methods for specially handling the shifts..
 lambday	so, in the COCG_M job, we'll first solve (which computes all of these and stores the solution matrix inside it).. and a subsequent get call will return the actual solution for the whole family
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, did you have time to have a look at the new LMNN PR? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1270
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I addressed the issues you pointed out a some days ago. I think it should be ready to merge
 lambday	HeikoS: we can use this for CG_M/COCG_M as needed (although not for our project but may be later) - will be flexible
 lambday	HeikoS: the only downside is that, we'll have to remember calling "solve" before we call the "get" each time - but that's not a problem I guess
 lambday	or, we'll move solve inside that "get", call it "solve_shifted" or something, and in COCG_M jobs, call that instead
 lambday	HeikoS: I can finish this implementaion by tonight and send a PR and then may be you can have a look (not much work so I won't get sad if I gotta change it later :D)

 gsomix	sonney2k, good evening, mr. Soeren.
 gsomix	sonney2k, I have prepared pack of changes for shogun. have you a minute to look at it?
 pickle27	hey guys
 pickle27	having the weirdest problem here
 pickle27	eigen3 will not transpose a matrix
 pickle27	like the code runs but it doesn't get transposed
 pickle27	anyone else ever seen this?
@iglesiasg	pickle27, what are you doing exactly?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: haha nice
 pickle27	Im computing eigenvectors and then I need to transpose them
@iglesiasg	pickle27, A.transpose() makes the transpose of A by doesn't assign to it, I believe
 pickle27	yeah you need to use transposeInPlace()
 lisitsyn	yes A.transpose() is expression
 gsomix	sonney2k, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1271
 pickle27	but that doesn't work either
@iglesiasg	aham!
 gsomix	van51, hey. there are some changes with line reader in my PR.
@iglesiasg	so transposeInPlace() is like A=A.tranpose()
 pickle27	yeah it explicitly says in the docs not to use A = A.transpose()
 lisitsyn	pickle27: too weird to be true!
 gsomix	van51, I replaced it with LineReader. more useful class.
 lisitsyn	I use transposeInPlace in my code
 lisitsyn	it works
 pickle27	it usually works for me too
 van51	gsomix: you mean FileReader?
 pickle27	but it isn't in this case
 pickle27	and I had another time the other day when it wouldn't either
@iglesiasg	pickle27, x-files!
 pickle27	hmmmm
 pickle27	maybe it is transposing ...
@iglesiasg	pickle27, are you doing array() or anything else on the way?
 pickle27	its confusing because of the values its a very symmetric thing
 pickle27	i think I need to sort actually instead
 gsomix	van51, oops, exactly. :)

 pickle27	hey guys
 pickle27	chasing down a slight bug in my program
 pickle27	http://pastebin.com/7K9rxHZq
 pickle27	is this a rotation?
@iglesiasg	pickle27, mmmm (thinking)
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I think that if you regard the first matrix as a rotation matrix of angle theta, then the second matrix is the rotation matrix of angle theta plus or minus (not sure about the sign) pi/2
 pickle27	thats what I was thinking
 pickle27	I'll try that out
 pickle27	okay
 pickle27	narrowing this down further
 pickle27	I have sign differences in my eigenvectors between matlab and eigen3
 pickle27	any idea how to fix this?
 pickle27	looks like the eigen3 equivalent of matlabs eig might be shcur
 pickle27	still has sign mismatch

 van51	:P
 pickle27	lisitsyn: narrowed down my problem
 pickle27	sign differences on the eigenvectors found using eigen3
 pickle27	isn't the same result as octave's eig() function
 lisitsyn	pickle27: well different signs are kind of ok
 pickle27	usually yeah but not for Jade apparently
 gsomix	van51, huh. life is pain. >:3
 lisitsyn	pickle27: why?
 gsomix	van51, btw free testing.
 pickle27	messes the cumulant matrices
 lisitsyn	pickle27: do you need positive eigenvalues?
 pickle27	I don't neccessarily need positive ones I just need the same signs as matlab
 lisitsyn	pickle27: are they all positive with matlab?
 lisitsyn	or negative
 pickle27	lisitsyn: http://pastebin.com/GZXs8RR8
 lisitsyn	pickle27: what about eigenvalues?
 pickle27	0.259276 and 2.15752 in both eigen3 and octave
 lisitsyn	pickle27: but different eigenvectors? weird!
 pickle27	Im just going to flip the sign if they are all neg to be pos
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, is it so weird that there are several eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I think so
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I just looked it up. Let me write it
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, Given that v is an eigenvector of a matrix A, then any scaled eigenvector c*v is also an eigenvector for the same eigenvalue.
@iglesiasg	I thinks it makes pretty much sense
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: true
 lisitsyn	yeah my bad
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, it was good to recall the property :)
 lisitsyn	so signs are whatever :)
 pickle27	yeah except it is affecting the algorithm ahhhhh
@iglesiasg	true, the constant can be negative
@iglesiasg	pickle27, maybe one of the implementations normalize the eigenvectors so they are unit
 lisitsyn	pickle27: then something like positivity is forced
 pickle27	hmm yeah could be that
 pickle27	it doesn't make any sense
 pickle27	I have 2 examples one ported from scikit learn and one that andreas gave me
 pickle27	in the scikit one eigen gives mainly neg eigenvectors and the orig alg gives positive
 pickle27	then its the opposite on andreas' example
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I wonder why sign matters here
 lisitsyn	if it operates eigenvectors it should be ready to sign changes
 pickle27	Im not sure
 lisitsyn	prince is born
 lisitsyn	hehe

@iglesiasg	Ubuntu clang version 3.0-6ubuntu3
@sonney2k	ahh ok too old
@sonney2k	3.1 introduce atomic
@iglesiasg	aham I see
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, did you want to check that thing or it doesn't matter?
@sonney2k	and it seems one needs clang3.2 for anything reasonable
@sonney2k	well would be nice
@sonney2k	maybe wiking has a newer clang?
@iglesiasg	aham I see
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I can check in my laptop too. I tried in the office computer so far
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, check clang++ -v first
@sonney2k	if the version is recent enough
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, 3.2.1 in my laptop
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, good enough
