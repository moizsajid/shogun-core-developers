 gsomix	wiking, I'm freaking retard. There is fix for #1395, let's see what Travis will say.
@wiking	gsomix: have u removed DISABLE_?
@wiking	:)
 gsomix	wiking, yep.
@wiking	u did okey
@wiking	let's see
@wiking	lambday: ping?
 lambday	wiking: pong
 lambday	wiking: no symlinks in /usr/lib or /usr/lib64
 lambday	:(
@wiking	mmm okey
 lambday	I guess default installation doesn't create this one
@wiking	lambday: what's your distro?
 lambday	fedora16.x86+64
@wiking	aha
@wiking	okey
@wiking	i'll add atlas detection
@wiking	just a sec
 lambday	wiking: thanks man
@wiking	or at least a preliminary one
@wiking	but you'lll have to test it because i dont have a machine to do so
 lambday	wiking: oh and we completely got rid of the consfigure script?
 lambday	wiking: no problem I will test it
 lambday	configure*
@wiking	lambday: indeed
@wiking	lambday: sonney2k was in a hurry it seems
 lambday	wiking: I don't know how this cmake works.. can I manually specify an interface to build, say, cmdline_static, or java_modular?
 lambday	wiking: or, say I have an older version of eigen3 somewhere and I want to make using that one instead of what I have in /usr/include/eigen3
@wiking	lambday: the interface you can manually specify
 lambday	wiking: how?
@wiking	lambday: well currently only libshogun is enabled by default
@wiking	lambday: the rest you read my email
@wiking	(see shogun mailing list
@wiking	)
 lambday	wiking: alright... I'll check it.. thanks
@wiking	lambday: [shogun] shogun with cmake
@wiking	this was the subject of the email

@wiking	lambday: ok i think i have a fix then
@wiking	lambday: just sent a latest fix
 lambday	wiking: alright checking
@wiking	lambday: as said: git reset --hard && rm cmake/FindAtlas.cmake
@wiking	and then run the cmake
@wiking	and show me the output
 lambday	okie
@wiking	lambday: do you have a liblapack_atlas.so.3 under /usr/lib64/atlas ?
 lambday	wiking: its actually in two different places, both /usr/lib64/ and /usr/lib64/atlas
 lambday	yes /usr/lib64/atlas/ has liblapack.so.3
@wiking	lambday: you have no liblapack_atlas.so.3 ?
@wiking	only liblapack.so.3
@wiking	?
 lambday	wiking: yep
 lambday	wiking: but it found
 lambday	A library with LAPACK API found. -- Found ATLAS: /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3;/usr/lib64/atlas/libcblas.so.3;/usr/lib64/atlas/libf77blas.so.3;/usr/lib64/atlas/libatlas.so.3;/usr/lib64/liblapack.so.3
@wiking	lambday: ok
 lambday	making
@wiking	lambday: can u plz now make the whole thing
@wiking	and try to run the tests
@wiking	let's hope this fixed it
@wiking	and then i can push the commit
 lambday	alright
 lambday	making
@wiking	ok let me know of the output
@wiking	gsomix: can we mark #1395 fixed then?
 gsomix	wiking, hmhm, there are no segfaults on your machine?
@wiking	gsomix: noup :)
@wiking	gsomix: i was just wondering if the discussion of the PR is settled...?
 lambday	wiking: yooooooooo
@wiking	lambday: what?
 lambday	wiking: make successful
 lambday	wiking: but now running the unit-tests
 lambday	umm
@wiking	lambday: ctest --output-on-failure
 gsomix	wiking, nope. you can close #1395.
 lambday	alright
@wiking	lambday: in the ./build directory where you did cmake and make
 lambday	okie
 lambday	wiking: oh and I need to cmake with -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
@wiking	lambday: indeed :)
 lambday	alright
@wiking	if u did not then u wont have tests
 sonne|work	gsomix: so what are your next steps?
 lambday	wiking: making again...
 lambday	wiking: by the way, make valgrind and valgrind-per-module things are still same, right?
 lambday	for unit tests
@wiking	lambday: no
@wiking	lambday: they are all gone
 lambday	no valgrind :(
 gsomix	sonne|work, libsvm, refactoring old code for use csv reader.
@wiking	lambday: u can have valgrind if u add -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON to cmake arguments
@wiking	lambday: then after cmake and make u can do: ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck
@wiking	and that'll do u a valgrind on all the tests
@wiking	if u want only on the unit test then: ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck -R unit
 lambday	wiking: ah alright
 gsomix	sonne|work, do we need sparse access methods for csv reader?
 gsomix	I mean this methods will be in libsvm reader.
 lambday	wiking: but I got this while making... svn: Server sent unexpected return value (307 Temporary Redirect) in response to OPTIONS request for 'http://googlemock.googlecode.com/svn/trunk'
 lambday	wiking: where shall I put gtest/gmock so that it doesn't try to download each time
 lambday	its in /usr/src
 sonne|work	gsomix: I could imagine a case where a sparse matrix is stored as a .csv but I guess it is sufficient to just convert it from a dense matrix

 gsomix_	sonne|work, cool.
@wiking	gsomix_: bugs for ya
 gsomix_	wiking, c'mon
 gsomix_	I have very bad internet connection now. :(
@wiking	gsomix_:  :(
@wiking	i'm just saying that i've found some misterious bugs
@wiking	lambday: any progress?
 lambday	wiking: yes.. ran unit-tests, now cmake-ing with dashboard reports on
 gsomix_	wiking, do you create issue on github? or so?
 lambday	so, check I do ctest -R unit, it just checks one unit-test
@wiking	gsomix_: yep i've even assigned you
@wiking	lambday: ctest -R unit runs the whole unit test
@wiking	i.e. all the unit tests that are currently in the repo
@wiking	lambday: can u plz run ctest --output-on-failure -R libshogun
 lambday	wiking: oki... but it doesn't report each one individually.. just said 100% tests passed
@wiking	lambday: just to see if everything is linked in a correct way?
 lambday	wiking: okay I will... waiting for make to complete
@wiking	lambday: ok.... --output-on-failure
 gsomix_	wiking, thanks!
@wiking	lambday: it reports if there's a failure
@wiking	lambday: otherwise it doesn't show the stdout/stdcout
 lambday	wiking: I tried removing that, but still same.. may be I did something wrong
 lambday	wiking: checking again
@wiking	lambday: if u really want it give -V or -VV flags for ctest
 lambday	alright
@wiking	lambday: if all the tests passed
@wiking	then there's not unit test output because there was nothing wrong with it
@wiking	i.e. --output-on-failure only shows the output if there's something wrong (as the cmd args says)
 lambday	oki
@wiking	lambday: ok so cblas/atlas is fixed actually with that patch
@wiking	right?
 lambday	wiking: yep :D

@wiking	sonne|work: yes... but still cblas has to be present...
@wiking	sonne|work: if there's no libcblas then LAPACK is not enabled...
 sonne|work	wiking: that is checked though right?
@wiking	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	ok perfect!
 sonne|work	wiking: now for the bots to work I still need an option to manually specify gmock/gtest paths
 sonne|work	wiking: for the other libs I guess there is some standard if they are not in standard include etc locations right?
@wiking	sonne|work: why we cannot have svn?
 sonne|work	wiking: you cannot assume machines with internet connectivity to build shogun
@wiking	sonne|work: no i dont assume that
@wiking	sonne|work: but then just dont do the tests
@wiking	and that's all
 sonne|work	wiking: why is bsd still failing http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun ?
@wiking	sonne|work: there's some weird gmock segfault

 sonne|work	this 'island' test is sth that has to pass for a software to be in debian
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	that'll be interesting
@wiking	because i dont know how i can add there a REVISION check
 sonne|work	wiking: what do you mean with REVISION check?
@wiking	sonne|work: well i have to assure that a given svn rev is provided for the gmock/gtest
@wiking	as src
@wiking	because for example the 1.6.0.zip is not sufficient...
 sonne|work	wiking: why not 1.6?
 sonne|work	not going with official releases will cause pain
@wiking	sonne|work: well that one is not sufficient
@wiking	that's why
 sonne|work	what is missing?
@wiking	i mean there's a good reason i was doing this this way
@wiking	a lot...
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't question that but what are the resons?
 sonne|work	wiking: will it present itself as 1.7 sth?
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	i'm not a gtest/gmock developer
@wiking	sonne|work: as far as i can see there's a constantly upgraded CHANAGES log where 1.7.0 is mentioned
@wiking	but that's not yet releaed
@wiking	released
 sonne|work	wiking: I have no idea why we need 1.7 but hey...

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix Atlas detection on FreeBSD
 thoralf	sonne|work: I'd like to change the sort_features() method in SGSparseVector a bit.  The usage of realloc introduces problems with sparse readers, since it frees the passed reference and creates a new one - but the sparse reader will never notice.
@wiking	lambday: let me know if this latest patch broke our atlas detection :P
 thoralf	sonne|work: So first of all, when using "vec = stream_features->get_vector();" - are we allowed to use this vector like our own or do we need to copy it before touching?

 sonne|work	wiking: but still if you have an idea how to specify a custom gmock/gtest path - that would be sufficient
 sonne|work	thoralf: I don't get where a realloc is needed?
@wiking	sonne|work: no that wouldn't be .... and there's no 1.7 release so it's interesting how can debian have 1.7
@wiking	sonne|work: i don't know if maaybe gmock has a versionheader.h
@wiking	or soemthing like that
 sonne|work	wiking: http://packages.debian.org/sid/google-mock
@wiking	but basically
@wiking	i fucking dont care
@wiking	it's working
@wiking	i'm sorry
 thoralf	sonne|work: Acutally it's two issues: The first one is that we're not writing the sorted data into the original reference, so that the original is getting invalid.
@wiking	it's just a bit too much now
 sonne|work	wiking: all I need is an option to specify the location where google mock is
@wiking	sonne|work: i canno tdo it
 sonne|work	how does one do it then?
 thoralf	sonne|work: The second is that (introduced by me) we're compressing the sparse vector and then doing a realloc to shrink.
@wiking	sonne|work: as i said i wouldn't know how to do it, with the constraints i've told you
 sonne|work	wiking: why not just do a compile check with some test and see if google mock/test works?
@wiking	sonne|work: why not reinvent the wheel?
 sonne|work	thoralf: the second makes a lot of sense though
@wiking	sonne|work: i'm sorry i'm too tired, and i see this work pointless
 sonne|work	wiking: well we are in all broken state right http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall ?
@wiking	sonne|work: and that's mostly not because of gmock
@wiking	sonne|work: apt-get/rpm install subversion
 sonne|work	wiking: sure also other stuff
@wiking	sonne|work: moreover on the rpm machine just build cmake from src
 sonne|work	on bsd it is cblas not working
 sonne|work	on cygwin and debian google mock/test
@wiking	sonne|work: fixt it
@wiking	sonne|work: yes because there's no svn
@wiking	sonne|work: but there's like svn for anything nowdays
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'bsd1 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 8m25s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@wiking	sonne|work: i dont think it's unreasonable to have svn on a buildbot
 sonne|work	thoralf: the realloc when compressing makes sense. but sorting could be done in place
 thoralf	sonne|work: I should just copy the vector returned by stream_features.
 thoralf	Since there is no proper way of signaling size changes to the caller.
@iglesiasg	see you later guys, heading to a PhD interview right now, wish me luck!
 thoralf	Even if we keep the reference - the caller will have a wrong num_entries count.
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: good luck :)

@wiking	-> the segfault happened there
 sonne|work	I see
 sonne|work	hard to see
 sonne|work	I guess you can only do valgrind/gdb to figure out what goes on
@wiking	sonne|work: indeed
@wiking	sonne|work: if u cmake with -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON
@wiking	then u can do
@wiking	ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck
@wiking	but maybe we should just by default add this ExperimentalMemCheck option for ctest
@wiking	(this will run valgrind for all the tests)
 sonne|work	wiking: for python modular before we did list a gdb backtrace when things fail
@wiking	sonne|work: that's preserved
 sonne|work	wiking: could we conditionally do this only when a test fails?
@wiking	sonne|work: dunno
@wiking	sonne|work: but i dont think so

@sonney2k	van51, the only thing to make the code smaller would be macros right?
 van51	sonney2k: I guess, what do you not like?
@sonney2k	van51, the other thing I don't understand is the CSGObject stuff is not yet converted right?
 van51	sonney2k: can you elaborate a bit?
@sonney2k	van51, only the if (m_refcount==NULL)
@sonney2k	+    return -1;
@sonney2k	+
@sonney2k	+  return m_refcount->ref();
@sonney2k	it could be 1 line doing the check with a macro
@sonney2k	van51, well CSGObject also has a refcount internally
@sonney2k	van51, and it is doing the exact same thing ref/unref/ref_count
@sonney2k	van51, so it would be natural to just have a single implementation
 van51	sonney2k: ah I see.
@sonney2k	van51, same with unref() etc
 van51	sonney2k: should I try to have it use the RefCount class?
@sonney2k	van51, yes you can just use it
@sonney2k	van51, and I think you could for ref have a static function in Refcount
@sonney2k	that gets as argument a RefCount*
@sonney2k	which then does ref()
@sonney2k	so int ref_static(RefCount*)
@sonney2k	van51, and you could in ref() { return ref_static(m_refcoutn))
@sonney2k	van51, OK?
 van51	sonney2k: that's the SGObject ref?
@sonney2k	van51, no
@sonney2k	van51, well these are 2 things
@sonney2k	1) reduce code in ref() / ...
@sonney2k	2) use RefCount in CSGObject too
 van51	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	for 1) you can use the static function
@sonney2k	2) would just be the same you did already in SGIO
@sonney2k	van51, ok then. this really simplifies the code a lot...
 van51	sonney2k: ok :)  I have one more question, that I commented on the code
@sonney2k	van51, well what error?
@sonney2k	van51, you need to include lib/common.h whenever you use int32_t
@sonney2k	van51, you can do VERBOSE=1 make to see the real command
@sonney2k	van51, have to leave the train now...
 van51	sonney2k: ok

@sonney2k	van51, hmmhh I am not sure now
* wiking wonders if malloc/realloc/calloc is replaced, does it mean that he malloc for new operator is replaced as well...?
@sonney2k	van51, IIRC the check was necessary in SGReferencedData too
@sonney2k	wiking, we tried overloading new /delete but it is not always possible
 van51	sonney2k: yea. what I'm saying is that, from what I understand, that's the only place where it's necessary
@wiking	sonney2k: but isn't new eventually just calling system's malloc?
@wiking	or c++ has it's on memory allocator itself...
@wiking	?
@sonney2k	van51, exactly in unref() the refcount could be set to NULL so it is possible
@wiking	btw shouldnt we start adding support for c++11's shared_ptr?
@sonney2k	wiking, well we don't 'overload' malloc etc
@sonney2k	wiking, well everything is broken right now so lets rather get it stable so we have a release post-gsoc
@wiking	sonney2k: ok because jemalloc and hoard actually overloads malloc
@wiking	sonney2k: travis is not broken :)
@sonney2k	wiking, travis tests just a tiny bit of stuff
@sonney2k	the easy part
@sonney2k	no different platforms not all interfaces...
@sonney2k	always same configurations

@wiking	yea i'm trying to find a fedora server
@sonney2k	van51, the big difference though is the unref() function - it calls delete this; and in the SGVector case it just frees data but never the vector itself
@sonney2k	wiking, is the redhat one not enough?
@wiking	sonney2k: well it's not the same but that redhat is like ancient
@wiking	sonney2k: it's like from 1995
@wiking	with cmake 2.6.
@wiking	x
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah well redhat
 van51	sonney2k: how was that tackled?
@sonney2k	van51, don't quite get it... SGVector is just keeping references to data
 van51	sonney2k: yea and you said that with the delete it would free the data
@wiking	the last time i used RH was when it was still version 4.2
@sonney2k	van51, all assignments etc would just copy references and increase refcounts
@sonney2k	van51, no it will not free the SGVector object but just the data (some virtual free_data function...)
@sonney2k	van51, you keep sgvector objects on stack solely

@sonney2k	van51, no
@sonney2k	van51, but difference w/ SGObject is that it calls delete this
@sonney2k	van51, with SGVector the object will remain but the refcount is gone
 van51	sonney2k: aah ok I get that
@sonney2k	van51, so you cannot fully replace the unref function everywhere but you have to call delete this etc when the refcount is <=0
@sonney2k	hmmhh
-!- hushell [~hushell@c-24-21-169-136.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
@sonney2k	maybe there is another race condition
@sonney2k	say 2 objects reach refcount=0 at the same time
@sonney2k	then one gets -1 and the other might get -2 and both will attempt to free data
@sonney2k	so I think it should only free when refcount==0
 van51	sonney2k: hmm makes sense
@sonney2k	sigh I think we need a stress test for SGVector just doing that - accessing a vector in parallel
 van51	sonney2k: I could do that
 van51	sonney2k: however, in SGReferenced data, the starting ref_count is 0 and so if unref is called, the value will be decreased by one and then checked against ==0
@sonney2k	van51, I am now wondering if this can be fixed at all with an atomic int - I mean the problem is that m_refcount is freed!
@sonney2k	van51, unref cannot be manually called...
@sonney2k	van51, it is a private function used only in copy constructors
@sonney2k	van51, so only when you do a=b;
@sonney2k	you will get refcount = 1
@sonney2k	but true
@sonney2k	it should be 1 from the beginning
@sonney2k	so when you have SGVector a
@sonney2k	you have refcount =1
@sonney2k	then when you do
@sonney2k	b=a
@sonney2k	you have 2
@sonney2k	when b is destroyed you get 1 again
@sonney2k	and when a is destroyed you get the data freed
 van51	yea
 van51	sonney2k: when would m_refcount be freed?

@iglesiasg	wiking, I like the dancing woman
@iglesiasg	tech me how to do it sensei
 van51	sonney2k: well yeah, but it's a class member, not static. If refcounting works as intended it should be destroyed then
 van51	sonney2k: no?
@wiking	iglesiasg: :dancer:
@sonney2k	van51, well unref is only called in destructor
@sonney2k	van51, actaully also in copy constructor when the object is overwritten
@sonney2k	as in a=b
@sonney2k	a would be unref()'d
@wiking	woah man

@wiking	iglesiasg: i've just had an oooold plan to add malloc replacements for shogun
@wiking	iglesiasg: but then i went around with this cmake hell
@wiking	but now finally i've managed to get back to it
@iglesiasg	it sounds nice
@iglesiasg	wiking, in what sense do you think it can improve stuff?
@iglesiasg	reading jemalloc page atm
@wiking	iglesiasg: what's your running time for libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel
@wiking	iglesiasg: ctest -R libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel
@iglesiasg	wiking, 3.28 seconds
@sonney2k	wiking, well we are still in hell no? We need the buildbot back to work, so static interfaces etc..
@wiking	iglesiasg: Debug mode right?
@iglesiasg	wiking, yes
@wiking	iglesiasg:  43/107 Test #141: libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel ........................   Passed    1.85 sec
@iglesiasg	wiking, is that release or debug?
@wiking	iglesiasg: i was around 4.x before jemalloc
@wiking	iglesiasg: debug
@iglesiasg	nice!
@wiking	iglesiasg: i'll do a comparison now
@wiking	iglesiasg: good thing that ctest has xml output
@wiking	so i can fast process the running times ;)
@iglesiasg	:)
@wiking	iglesiasg: but i'll use Release
@iglesiasg	wiking, does it entail big dependency to use jemalloc?
@sonney2k	van51, only problem is that SGObject for sure needs a 0 as initial refcount since on return it will be increased by swig
 van51	sonney2k: hmm
@wiking	iglesiasg: well i just did sudo port install jemalloc
@wiking	iglesiasg: afaik there's apt-get for it
 van51	sonney2k: let me wrap some stuff up first in what I've already started
@wiking	iglesiasg: http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/libjemalloc1
@sonney2k	van51, I think the same race condition exists in CSGObject unref() just between m_ref_lock.unlock(); and delete this;
@sonney2k	van51, so I think both have a -- though very unlikely -- race condition
 van51	sonney2k: maybe I should make the conversion and then we can use a tool like helgrind to check for possible race conditions by using a test like you said?
 van51	sonney2k: I updated with some changes, have another look when you can
 van51	sonney2k: I'll start now working on SGObject

@sonney2k	wiking, can I just compile for one interface at a time?
@sonney2k	otherwise I don't see in the buildbot which interfaces fails but only the end result

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: use forward declaration for RefCount and fix name clash ref_count() vs ref_count
@sonney2k	wiking, but then I have to configure for each setting again right? I cannot do them all in one go but just have a different target for each interface I can make <target>?
@wiking	doh there's no out of box boxplot by d3js
@wiking	sonney2k: you can compile the all the interfaces at once
@wiking	btw "buildbot which interfaces fails but only the end result" why?
@wiking	you mean which test fails? or which compile fails?
@sonney2k	wiking, look at the master.cfg
@sonney2k	wiking, I had one Compile step per interface
@sonney2k	but only one configure step
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	yes the compile step will not be separate
@sonney2k	leaving that aside I have trouble with this now http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1500/steps/configure/logs/stdio
@wiking	the test step can be made different
@sonney2k	Could NOT find JNI (missing: JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY
@sonney2k	wiking, not the target for the compile?
@wiking	mmm why is there no jni :(
@sonney2k	I mean have sth like targets: all my interfaces?
@wiking	sonney2k: well
@sonney2k	it used to work with configure but maybe it is this JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH?
@sonney2k	what is this?
@wiking	sonney2k: actually there is a target
@wiking	sonney2k: make shogun
@wiking	that is the libshogun
@wiking	make python_modular
@wiking	make <interface>_modular
@wiking	should work
@sonney2k	wiking, exactly what I want
@wiking	as they are custom targets
@wiking	so it should work i think
@wiking	of course if you just type
@wiking	make
@wiking	then i'll do make all
@wiking	and that'll build u everything
@wiking	mmm where's your java?
@wiking	standard openjdk by debian?
@wiking	or some funky shit?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes standard openjdk
@wiking	mmm neverseen this before

@sonney2k	wiking, but it worked with configure?
@wiking	sonney2k: yes for pyton
@wiking	sonney2k: for python
@wiking	other interfaces are <interface>_modular
