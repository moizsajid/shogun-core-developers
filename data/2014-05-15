 lambday	HeikoS: hey!
 lambday	HeikoS: I added 2 some methods in the linalg lib
 lambday	oops sum*
 lambday	refactored the code a bit - added nested namespace as you suggested
 lambday	another thought - we don't want these methods to get inlined
 lambday	although compiler might be smart enough to take care of this but I think mentioning it explicitly is another way -
 lambday	like defining some macro SHOGUN_DONT_INLINE __attribute__ ((noinline)) and using it before these methods
* thoralf thinks of premature optimization. ;)
 lambday	thoralf: well this is just an idea! this part is header only so any accidental inlining may bloat up the size
 lambday	although its better to leave this up to compiler :-/
 thoralf	lambday: IMO don't think about compiler internals too much.
 lambday	thoralf: umm.. yeah may be that's better
 thoralf	lambday: Though, try to write proper code that's correct/sane and "easy" to understand. ;)
 lambday	thoralf: hehe! yeah - although for the sake of super simplified API in the linalg tasks I had to add some c++0x template tricks.. I hope its alright since its internal and we'll just use this API in shogun

 juliohm	What is the best technique you know for fitting nonparametric distributions in high-dimensions? I'm using Kernel Density Estimation for small number of variables.
