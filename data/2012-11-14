 ptizoom	blackburn:yet another exemple of backward propagation training...reward from the master, jealousy from the others....
 sonne|work	work == reward, more work == more reward
 sonne|work	wiking: I will ask today.
 sonne|work	this situation is not really helpful
 wiking	sonne|work: yo
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah but i think they have their 'good reason' for it
 wiking	so by asking we are not going to go any further
 wiking	i guess the latest we'll know something about it on the 3rd of december :D
 wiking	when we realise that we are not there or when we are ther ;)
 wiking	*there
 sonne|work	hehe
 wiking	sonne|work: you should make a shogun-foundation ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: where people can donate :>
 sonne|work	wiking: well I asked upfront and carol said that they know that the schedule is extremely tight so they want to do the decision w/i a week
 wiking	they can even make donation for a given feature ;)
 wiking	that'd be cool
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	haha
 sonne|work	carol is on vacations
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	mm isn't thanksgiving is about to happen soon?
 sonne|work	returning just before the meeting :)
 wiking	oh yeah 22nd of nov
 wiking	so maybe she went on hunting some turkey ;P
 wiking	sonne|work: here?
 sonne|work	yes?
 wiking	sonne|work: any suggestion which machine would be adecvate to solve this dual problem:
 wiking	i hate pdf
 wiking	sorry gimme a sec to formulate the problem
 wiking	sonne|work: http://test.izyba.com/latex?&space;D%28\alpha_*,\beta_*%29=max_{\alpha,%20\beta}%20\sum_i%20\alpha_i%20+%20\sum_j\sum_h%20\beta_{j,h}%20-%20\frac{1}{2}%20||\sum_{\alpha}%20\alpha%20\Phi%28x_i,%20h_i%29%20-%20\sum_j%20\sum_h%20\beta_{j,h}%20\Phi%28x_j,%20h%29||^2%20\\%20\mattext{s.t.%200%20%3C=%20\alpha_i%20%3C=%20C_i,%20\forall%20i;%200%20%3C=%20\beta_{j,h}%20%3C=%20C_2,%20\forall%20j,%20\forall%20\in%20H}
 wiking	shiiit
 wiking	sonne|work: this is the problem http://pastebin.com/X2t8bEAd
 wiking	and just copy-paste it there: http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php
 sonne|work	http://mathbin.net/113694
 wiking	yeeey
 wiking	that :D
 sonne|work	it looks very SVMish
 wiking	yeah it's a dual form
 sonne|work	yeah but you also only have box constraints on alpha / beta
 sonne|work	you should make the quadratic term explicit btw
 sonne|work	you could certainly use ocas to solve that
 wiking	ocas?
 sonne|work	well libqp
 wiking	aaah
 sonne|work	ocas assumes fixed Cs
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i'm just checking libqp's formulation
 sonne|work	I mean you could introduce gamma = [alpha beta] and reformulate the problem to use only that
 sonne|work	then you have just one variable to optimize over
 sonne|work	different box constraints for different parts
 sonne|work	and some linear term
 sonne|work	and quadratic term
 sonne|work	http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~xfrancv/libqp/html/
 wiking	yeah
 sonne|work	you have no bias term so no equality constraint even
 sonne|work	so the problem is more simple but I don't know if libqp has something internally that works w/o one
 wiking	but this is minimizing the problem :S
 wiking	i mean qp
 wiking	*libqp
 sonne|work	then mimimize -qp :D
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	i hope S_{equ} can be a zeroset
 sonne|work	no not allowed
 sonne|work	ask vojtech
 wiking	:S
 sonne|work	I am pretty sure one of the sub-solvers for solving the problem w/ bias constraint needs a solver w/o one - so that one should be in libqp too
 sonne|work	btw I guess you tested this with mosek already?
 wiking	no not at all
 sonne|work	why not?
 wiking	i've just seen this paper
 wiking	and it would be great to have a solver that doesn't depend on mosek :)
 sonne|work	sure but first build a reference then do the real impl.
 wiking	mmm i guess mosek has a solver for this
 sonne|work	sure it is a QP
 sonne|work	but you still need to create that gamma
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	the question still the same
 wiking	sonne|work: https://gist.github.com/4072038
 wiking	line 197
 wiking	i want to commit this solver tday
 wiking	so i need a solution ;)
 sonne|work	its only in a .cpp so I don't care
 wiking	sonne|work: ah sure?
 wiking	ok then here goes the PR
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] vigsterkr opened pull request #823: Add SO-SVM solver based on Chun-Nam Yu's implementation (master...so)  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/823
 sonne|work	wiking: did you ifdef with HAVE_MOSEK ?
 sonne|work	wiking: and could you do w/o vector in the .h?
 wiking	i've done ifdef for mosek
 sonne|work	apart from that ok
 wiking	since this solver could use SVMlight
 sonne|work	cannot see it
 wiking	it's only within cpp at a given place
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/823/files#L0R329
 wiking	ah ok i'll remove the std::vector header includ ethere...
 wiking	but we need to update svmlight somehow for that
 wiking	:)
 wiking	sonne|work: ok i cannot move the include ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/823/files#L1R137
 wiking	as the u can see the resize_cleanup function args contain std::vector
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] ptizoom opened pull request #824: perl_modular: fixed string_from_pdl<char> conversion. (master...perl_121114)  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/824
 sonne|work	wiking: couldn't you use SGVector for that or dynarray?
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] sonney2k pushed 2 new commits to master: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/compare/2f3bb6289502...0cdc7eb45a44
-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master d2765ab ptizoom: perl_modular: fixed string_from_pdl<char> conversion....
-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 0cdc7eb Soeren Sonnenburg: Merge pull request #824 from ptizoom/perl_121114...
 wiking	sonne|work: i'd need to define the template for SGVector<SGSpsarseVector...>
 wiking	but i need to send a fix anyways for that PR
 wiking	i'm just checking whether it compiles now
 sonne|work	wiking: btw do you understand why std::vector works even with SGVector objects?
 sonne|work	I mean it is on the stack
 sonne|work	or is it using new[] ?
 sonne|work	wiking: anyway you could use DynArray
 sonne|work	but you need these sh... inplace constructors
 wiking	sonne|work: it's on the heap
 wiking	there... let's see if travis can compile it now
 wiking	ok at least now it compiles on travis
 ptizoom	sonne*:red concerns on formatting...I cannot promise a good style, but suggest to indent at the end of development and doc....but will try anyway!
 ptizoom	sonne*:there are still many big problems in perl....
 ptizoom	sonne*:sparse stuff is not tested at all! inf and nan values handling.
 ptizoom	sonne*: also, string_to_pdl does not work as expected...I was looking at that.
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@37.61.179.13] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	wiking: oppan gangnam style solver?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes std vector uses constructors
 blackburn	so no problem with sgvector
 blackburn	std is safe you should believe :)
 wiking	blackburn: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
@sonney2k	wiking, I just learned - tonight (timeout of your choice) we will get some notification email
@sonney2k	so so after lunch tomorrow CET
@sonney2k	s/timeout/timezone
 wiking	:>
 wiking	i guess that means we are not in :)
 wiking	otherwise they would have sent that yeah you are in but we'll announce it officially tonight :)

* wiking having the flow with boost
 blackburn	wiking: boost is illegal in germany
 wiking	idontcare
 wiking	i'm working on my shit
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	we are all working on our own shit
 wiking	somebody figure out wha tto do with that std::vector so that it can be merged
 blackburn	wiking: I have nothing against it in .cpp
 wiking	its in .h
 wiking	as for a func args
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	wiking: may be some vodka?
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	hard to speed up brain activity w/o
 wiking	:>
 wiking	yes yes
 wiking	hahaha i think the most i like about c++11 is the auto variable :)
 blackburn	why?
 wiking	no more fucking
 wiking	std::map<something long, somethingevenlonger>::const_iterator
 blackburn	typedef
 wiking	lolface
 blackburn	you should not use such types in your code I think
 wiking	i'm not creating industry standard code
 blackburn	I use typedefs for that
 wiking	just trying to test something as fast as possible
 wiking	and usually at that moment
 blackburn	I'd rather have ParameterMap than std::unordered_map<fdsfsdfdsf,fsdfsdfs>
 wiking	my code changes like everyfuckingtime
