 Guest206	Where can I find documentation for the methods StringByteFeatures, SNPFeatures, ByteFeatures, obtain_from_dot? What do these functions do?
 Guest206	Which files are these methods defined in?
 Guest206	According to the search engine StringByteFeatures is not even mentioned in the documentation?
 sonne|work	it is the same as stringfeatures
 sonne|work	just bytes as content

@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have time to work on getting the tests back to work?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not now but yes
@sonney2k	ok, IIRC that is the only thing we are missing before we can release 1.1
@sonney2k	so please work on it when you find time
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure, it is only this week time rush I hope
 blackburn	one semester work done, one to go this week
 blackburn	sonney2k: moreover I'm going to implement error funcs in converters
 blackburn	that we can re-use
 blackburn	i.e. for MDS it is residual distance matrix norm
 blackburn	then if it is ~1e-10 - all OK
@sonney2k	blackburn, more important to first get a new release out with what we have
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	it is nice to have the extra stuff but that can wait for release+1
@sonney2k	otherwise we will never finish
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is not extra but testing
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you solved madeleine issue anyhow?
 blackburn	I saw you fixed example
@sonney2k	not sure what her issue
@sonney2k	is
@sonney2k	mkl convergence is a bit tricky - algos fail when kernels are not properly normalizes
 blackburn	sonney2k: Solver type not supported
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	okay will test later
@sonney2k	glpk not isntalled
 blackburn	sonney2k: her issue is memory leaks and failings
 CIA-37	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rfd6b20d / (4 files in 3 dirs): don't link against narray.so but instead dlopen narray - http://git.io/2bh9kQ
@sonney2k	she should ask on the mailinglist
@sonney2k	too tough question to solve easily
@sonney2k	I will reboot into osx and see if my ruby dlopen hack works
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
