@sonney2k	blackburn, any comments to http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html ?
@sonney2k	I would now send this around to mentors for double checking...
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, but going to update multiclass thing in next hour
 blackburn	well feel free to send, this one is for you
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you get any answer from alex binder?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
@sonney2k	about what?
 blackburn	well you were unsure about him?
@sonney2k	what should I have asked hiim?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	I asked him weeks ago and said he is still up to it
 blackburn	ah then did wiking get an answer?
 blackburn	btw where is he :(
@sonney2k	wiking was supposed to send him an email + cc me
@sonney2k	didn't receive any email yet...
@sonney2k	so no idea
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	I mean he is probably very good choice for this task
@sonney2k	blackburn, considering that you already work with code he contributed - yes :)
 blackburn	hah yeah
 blackburn	I think we have good ideas
 blackburn	lesser than last year but more focused
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think should has priority? ecoc or trees?
@sonney2k	I think having less is better
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think ovr / ovo / and then the nips paper stuff (trees)
 blackburn	I am for ecoc, but it is mainly up to you
 blackburn	why did you include cheng soon? :)
-!- axitkhurana [~akshit@180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is up with cheng?
@sonney2k	blackburn, arent' trees just a special case of ecoc?
 blackburn	I just curious what is he is interested
 blackburn	no, I'd say no
@sonney2k	look at the idea - then you know :)
 blackburn	oh damn
 blackburn	how did I miss it?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, IIRC ecoc is just a general name to convert any multiclass problem into a sequence of 2 class problems
 blackburn	yes but I don't think tree and ecoc principles are the same
 blackburn	I can't imagine hamming distance thing on trees
@sonney2k	blackburn, look at http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/escalera10a/escalera10a.pdf
@sonney2k	ovo is one ecoc principle :)
 blackburn	yes but trees are not..
@sonney2k	blackburn, they are, cf. 2.1.2
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	ok I was wrong then
@sonney2k	so I guess porting that ecoc library over from octave would be the real task with some subtle hard stuff

 blackburn	sonney2k: will you write down anything into vojtech's idea?
-!- ishaanmlhtr [~chatzilla@115.242.51.224] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, vojtech will do - he was just busy with ICML deadline
@sonney2k	submission that is
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	when do you plan to submit?
@sonney2k	the day the submission thing is open
@sonney2k	...and then polish - as usual
 blackburn	why do you hurry?
@sonney2k	no hurry
 axitkhurana	Hi, I don't have much experience in ML, I would like to learn and contribute.
 blackburn	sonney2k: still here?
 blackburn	axitkhurana: hi
 axitkhurana	blackburn: I have done some work in python (and django)
 axitkhurana	Could you suggest where to start?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	do you have any ml experience?
 axitkhurana	not much.
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	ok let me think
 blackburn	so you want to study ML or rather to contribute into non-ML parts of shogun?
 axitkhurana	I'd like to study ML.
 blackburn	okay I see
 blackburn	have you checked examples?
 axitkhurana	Although I would not mind contributing to non-ML parts too.
 axitkhurana	Not yet.
 blackburn	ok while you have python example
 blackburn	err experience :)
 blackburn	you could do following
 blackburn	install shogun/try some examples
 blackburn	then you may implement some simple graphical example with downloader
 axitkhurana	ok,  I've installed shogun
 axitkhurana	I'll try some examples
 blackburn	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
 blackburn	when you could generalize to UCI repo
 blackburn	i.e. user would be able to choose dataset, download data and approach the problem with shogun
 blackburn	is the idea clear for you?
 axitkhurana	yes
 axitkhurana	thanks, I'll try a few examples and get back to you.
 blackburn	ok
