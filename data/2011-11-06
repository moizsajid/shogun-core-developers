 CIA-37	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r7708783 / (2 files): Added warning to not use parallel LTSA with old LAPACK - http://git.io/0Ez3sQ
-!- alesis-novik [~alesis@dhcp-90-089.inf.ed.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	alesis-novik: I was waiting for you! :)
 alesis-novik	Hey blackburn
 alesis-novik	What's up?
 blackburn	alesis-novik: I have question about possible ltsa bug, did you use it with multiple threads?
 alesis-novik	No, at least not explicitly
 blackburn	alesis-novik: the problem is there are lapack bug
 blackburn	in <3.3
 blackburn	and if it is >1 threaded - it would be a little random
 blackburn	cause DLAMCH routine is not thread-safe
 alesis-novik	Hmm, I think it automatically creates threads, I should update my shogun pull
 alesis-novik	I'll do that next week since I'm trying to get some results for my meeting with the supervisor tomorrow
 blackburn	alesis-novik: just try ltsa.parallel.set_num_threads(1) to force it be 1-threaded
 blackburn	as I noticed this bug affects only ltsa
 alesis-novik	Does it have the method in the older versions (but after the release)
 blackburn	yes, it is shogun-wide
 blackburn	and it is here from 0.*
 alesis-novik	Cool, I'll try that
