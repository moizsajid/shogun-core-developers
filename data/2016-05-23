@HeikoS	wiking: the cookbook travis preview fails
@HeikoS	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun%20-%20PR/builds/237/steps/cookbook/logs/stdio
@HeikoS	think sphinx is missing
@HeikoS	I guess that is since it moved to the AWS
@wiking	HeikoS: not anymore
@wiking	noup
@wiking	it has nothing to do with it
@wiking	HeikoS: check now: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3197
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/cookbook_pr/b326aa9fad9860a184a1d4059d83fe032419f001/
@HeikoS	oh now worked
@HeikoS	no idea what that was
@wiking	yep fixed it
@wiking	there was a little error
@HeikoS	ok thanks
@wiking	i wanna setup gpu worker
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	any news from gpl friend?
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	cool!
@wiking	he told me that it's ok
@wiking	so we can keep the old repo
@wiking	but we'll have to remove the code
@wiking	(gpl code)
@wiking	to a separate repo
@wiking	which should be fine
@HeikoS	ok then cool
@HeikoS	hey that is great
@HeikoS	shall we do before release?
@HeikoS	how would you approach?
@HeikoS	in terms of build managment
@wiking	build managment?
@wiking	what do you mean?
@wiking	it's just an extra submodule
@wiking	and that's it

 lisitsyn	hey leagoetz
 sanuj	leagoetz, mine is here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3197
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, adding tags to shogun's SGObject in a different branc
 sanuj	branch
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah ok :)
 leagoetz	sanuj: yes, great, I've seen your email already
 leagoetz	in the process of updating the Wiki
 sanuj	cool
 arianepaola	Hello everyone :-)
 leagoetz	hey Ariane
 arianepaola	Hi leagoetz, I will add a cookbook contribution shortly
 leagoetz	how is it going?
 leagoetz	ah, cool!
 leagoetz	because GSoC is starting ... and we need everything ready :)
 arianepaola	:-)
 leagoetz	Saurabh7: I also need some cooking from you ...
 leagoetz	also your timeline says 'cookbook' for the final week
 leagoetz	but I hope it should be obvious to everyone now (given the amount of hassling by me ;P) how important it is to us that you contribute cookbook pages THROUGHOUT GSoC
 leagoetz	just a reminder ^^
 sanuj	leagoetz, i was wondering if it is possible to link the important meetings irc logs in the gsoc wiki section
 sanuj	will be helpful
 leagoetz	sure that should be possible
 leagoetz	certainly from now on
 leagoetz	like for our meeting tomorrow
 sanuj	thanks :)

@HeikoS	train wifi was crap
@HeikoS	and my phone died
@HeikoS	wiking: so where are all the hard coding students? :)
@HeikoS	wiking: i migh thave to leave soon
@wiking	hahaha yeah dunno
@HeikoS	wiking: just was asking about release and gpl branch
@wiking	yeah i'm gonna finish those
@HeikoS	what sthe best approach in your eyes?
@wiking	as well as the remaining
@HeikoS	and how can I help
@wiking	tickets for the release
@wiking	and cut a release asap
@HeikoS	kk
@wiking	btw managed to get a gpu instance working with shogun
@wiking	only sad part is
@HeikoS	I think the GPL thing is most work, no?
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@wiking	that we only utilise OPENCL backend for viennacl
@wiking	mmm that's just simple copy paste shit
@wiking	nothing big there
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah but time
@HeikoS	ok meta examples failing on travis
@HeikoS	not sure since when and why
@wiking	yeah do something about that plz
@HeikoS	will do
@wiking	thnx

@wiking	they are not failing here right
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	seems travis

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: hihi
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Greetings!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: how are things?
@HeikoS	wiking: whats the java version on buildbot?
@HeikoS	travis is 1.8.0
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: got something to discuss with you
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: good!
@wiking	HeikoS: it's openjdk
@wiking	and not oracle jdk
@HeikoS	I see
@wiking	1.7.0
@HeikoS	wiking: ah it was sanuj
@HeikoS	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/132213321#L2585
@HeikoS	type error
@HeikoS	might need to change the grammar
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: start from the smallest? cookbook - I have modshogun error from the very beginning when I try to run examples
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: locally?
@HeikoS	in all languages?
 OXPHOS	yes. even with the python example in undocumented
 OXPHOS	yes.
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	so in order to run e.g. a python example
@HeikoS	you need to set two environment variables:
@HeikoS	PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@HeikoS	(or run make install)
@HeikoS	but better set the variables
@HeikoS	so that python sees your shogun build
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: the same is true for all other modular targets
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: know what I am talking about?
 OXPHOS	aha..just to show python where things are?
@HeikoS	exactly
 OXPHOS	what is LD_LIBRARY_PATH (LD)?
@HeikoS	example:
@HeikoS	echo "Adding shogun_develop to python and ld lib path"
@HeikoS	export PYTHONPATH=/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/interfaces/python_modular:$PYTHONPATH
@HeikoS	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: this is where the system looks for shared libraries
@HeikoS	in this case: libshogun.so
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: otherwise, you will get an error when running things
 OXPHOS	okay thx. lemme try.
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: should be quick to fix
@HeikoS	let me know if you need help
@HeikoS	or ask lisitsyn or wiking
 OXPHOS	should these be in the readme or this is too basic XD
@HeikoS	they are
@HeikoS	if you feel like they need to be more upfront, please send a patch, very useful! :)
 OXPHOS	sure : )
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Serialization: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/c4a11c1d378aa3d9911744300feb79b5
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so what is your plan for this week?
 OXPHOS	start with serialization since I kinda started?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: cereal uses smart pointers
 OXPHOS	I tried integrate cereal in SGVector and KMeans.
@HeikoS	so might depend on that transition
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	a working prototype anywhere?
@HeikoS	otherwise that is first step
@HeikoS	but fine to start with this if you feel like
@HeikoS	wiking: ^ ok with you as well?
-!- Saurabh7_ [~Saurabh7@117.248.210.124] has joined #shogun
 OXPHOS	It worked. I added some codes in SGVecotr and KMeans. I don't know how to highlight them other than pull request. But I put the patch in gist
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I see you use std::vector to wrap shogun SGVector
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we can do this in a feature branch
@HeikoS	shall I create one?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 hi!
 OXPHOS	sure thx.
 Saurabh7_	yo hello
@HeikoS	I gotta leave soon, but will be back from train a bit later
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_ shall we talk tomorrow before the GSOC meeting?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: same for you, shall we talk a bit then?
 Saurabh7_	HeikoS, ok i ll be around
@HeikoS	both, can you plan the week a bit in terms of what you want to do exactly etc?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Sure!
@HeikoS	then we can dicsuss tomorrow
@HeikoS	also maybe some first concrete issues that we need to solve
 OXPHOS	kk
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I created a feature branch fork from develop
@HeikoS	you can send PRs against that now
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: cool thanks!
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/feature/cereal
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: feature brnaches are a bit more easy to work with
@HeikoS	travis runs on the PRs
@HeikoS	but the buildbot doesnt
@HeikoS	so one can prototype more quickly
@HeikoS	but then merging is more work
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: can you send a PR for the working SGVector?
@HeikoS	then we can discuss over that tomorrow
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: so about the indexing
@HeikoS	I am not sure I get the problem
@HeikoS	can you send an email?=
 OXPHOS	sure. but i currently have cereal at local. should i just send the whole library for now?
@HeikoS	gotta run now, see you
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: mmh
@HeikoS	ask wiking

@wiking	kk lemme se
@wiking	e
@wiking	why dont you create a pr? :D
 OXPHOS	wiking: I'm gonna pull a PR in feature branch. Can I dump the whole external/cereal library in by now?
 OXPHOS	Not sure how travis will find cereal
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	we can work on that
 OXPHOS	wiking: okay. Then lemme do it now.

@HeikoS	Saurabh7
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_:
@HeikoS	so about the indexing
@HeikoS	we definitely dont want to change method signatures everywhere
@HeikoS	wiking: hi
@HeikoS	but it should not be necessary
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 around?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: you still around?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so we can discuss a bit now
@HeikoS	two points I would like to talk about
@HeikoS	plan for this week and cereal prototype
@HeikoS	plan for this week: cookbook pages and cereal plan.
@HeikoS	cereal prototype: PR against feature branch
@HeikoS	thoughts about those things?
 OXPHOS	sounds good
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I mean I wanted to get your thoughts and ideas on what these points would be
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: not just tell you ;)
 OXPHOS	haha lemme grab my notes
 Saurabh7_	HeikoS, hi
 Saurabh7_	 machine->add_subset(train_inds, str(fold_id))       machine->train()
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 hi
 Saurabh7_	is this thread safe thought
 Saurabh7_	though
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: I think I dont get why the method signatures need to be changed
@HeikoS	when there is a default parameter
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: so essentially each identifier manages a difference subset
@HeikoS	and putting a particular one in doesnt affect the others
 Saurabh7_	yes but  how would train know which to access
 OXPHOS	1. test save/load methods in kmeans, json, xml, binary; 2. add save/load methods in SGString, SGMatrix etc. 3. add cereal.cmake
 OXPHOS	I have 4 5 6 7. But honestly so far I don't feel smart pointer necessary
 OXPHOS	and I tried smart pointer, failed..
 Saurabh7_	 machine->add_subset (in thread 1)  )
 Saurabh7_	some compuataion in 1
 Saurabh7_	 machine->add_subset(train_inds, str(fold_id)) in thread 2
 Saurabh7_	back to 1 ?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: get it now you mean inside
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ok that is good
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so I fear that allocating empty SGObject instances will be hard
@HeikoS	what about going ahead with a working version of SGVector
@HeikoS	and then a CSGOBject
@HeikoS	not KMeans, as it has complex sub-types
@HeikoS	an easier one for now
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: good point, any ideas to resolve? we dont want to change all that code
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: but it might be impossible without in fact
 Saurabh7_	yes i thought about it
 Saurabh7_	cant see other way
 Saurabh7_	other than have different subset stack on copies
@HeikoS	need to tell the model somehow in which thread it lives with this approach
 Saurabh7_	yes for taht each acces pattern would need the identifier
@HeikoS	Saurabh7_: you know how other libs do this?
@HeikoS	store copies of data in memory?
@HeikoS	is that the only way?
 Saurabh7_	dont know in detail
 Saurabh7_	scikit uses joblib
@HeikoS	sklearn has a new version
@HeikoS	yeah thats the one
@wiking	HeikoS: ?
@HeikoS	wiking: discussing thread safe subset
@HeikoS	wiking: one way is passing an identifier with each subset
@HeikoS	but then we need this idenfitier when asking for data from the thread
@HeikoS	wiking: any thoughts on how to do it without changing existing code?
@wiking	mmmm
@HeikoS	wiking: without storing copies of memory
@wiking	HeikoS: well either pointers to the data
@HeikoS	wiking: but that also requires the thread to know which fraction of data is accessed
@wiking	?
@wiking	what do you mean fraction of the data
@wiking	anyhow there's another option
@HeikoS	for xvalidation e.g.
@wiking	is to have thread safe
@wiking	iterators
@wiking	but first
@wiking	what you wanna actually fix here
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah the iterator would need to be passed to the algorithm
@wiking	do we wanna solve the problem of a r/w view
@HeikoS	we want multicore xvalidation
@wiking	or a read-only view
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	read only atm
@wiking	ah then i think
@wiking	introducing a const_iterator for the feature
@wiking	would be the best idea
@HeikoS	kk
@wiking	or?
@HeikoS	so lets think about it
@HeikoS	have svm
@HeikoS	that accepts a CFeatures instance
@HeikoS	we make this one an iterator (somehow)
@HeikoS	and then pass different ones to each machine
@HeikoS	in fact
@HeikoS	no iterator necessary
@HeikoS	just have multiple CFeatures instances
@HeikoS	each with different subset
@HeikoS	pointing to same data
@HeikoS	this way, the CMachine instance doesnt just interacts with that
@HeikoS	right?
@wiking	well yeah
@wiking	you dont need an actual itertor
@wiking	i just wanted to give an idea with the concept
-!- Saurabh7__ [~Saurabh7@1.39.98.181] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, just copies of CFeatures
@HeikoS	sure sure
@wiking	yeah but not the data
@HeikoS	yes, same data
@HeikoS	all const methods
@wiking	yep yep
@HeikoS	like CSubsetFeatures

@HeikoS	lambday: jojo
@lambday	HeikoS: hola
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: so
@HeikoS	get the idea?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: [not sure when to interrupt] Currently we only serialize parameters [in class] individually. thinking of serializing one class as a whole?
 Saurabh7__	yeah sorry i missed some part
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: anytime!
@wiking	OXPHOS: got a PR in email
@wiking	but 404 on github
@wiking	:)
 OXPHOS	Never mind it is not the latest version..
-!- Saurabh7_ [~Saurabh7@59.88.174.17] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
@wiking	ok works now
 shogun-buildbot	build #241 of deb1 - libshogun - PR is complete: Failure [failed git]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun%20-%20PR/builds/241  blamelist: OXPHOS
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: not sure what you mean
 OXPHOS	wiking: some commits are not there yet
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	checking stuff
@lambday	OXPHOS: how's it going?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: so, the x-validation class would, rather than adding subsets to features, create multiple CFeatures objects, each pointing to the same data, but with different subsets applied to them
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS,  so sort of shallow copy ?
@HeikoS	wiking: same for your bagging machine
@HeikoS	rather than putting subsets, create new feature objects
@HeikoS	or does it write?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: im thinking: kmeans.parameters.load() loads everything. So SGObject is created by default constructor or whatever before loading
 OXPHOS	lambday: Hey!
@lambday	wiking: hey what was the flag to check whether we have openmp or not? HAVE_OPENMP or something? you remember?
@wiking	lambday: in code or in cmake?
@lambday	wiking: in code
@wiking	lambday: no thing like this is checked afaik
@lambday	basically I want to include omp.h, if we have openmp..
@wiking	but imo #pragma -s are ignored
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: do you mean we can load(kmeans). Then we create an instance of kmeans with saved parameters?
@lambday	yeah for pragmas it is alright
@wiking	mm that case introduce
@wiking	a define in config.h.in
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: no
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__:  different subset on each of them
@HeikoS	only the same data
@lambday	wiking: alright.. yeah was checking for that HAVE_* thing but couldn't find it anywhere.. thought if it's there you'd know :)
@HeikoS	so shallow copy + subset
@lambday	OXPHOS: working on cerealization?
@wiking	OXPHOS: ok so this is noob
@wiking	OXPHOS: close the pr
@wiking	beause you've imported actually cereal to the codebase
@wiking	fuck github is broken
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: sure, but if you use default constructor, then the memory for its members is not allocated ... that can be tricky. But will see, just go ahead for now
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: any plan on which cookbook pages you want to add?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and any update on the modular bindings issue you had?
 OXPHOS	lambday: yes: ) had some work on linalg but not posted yet
@wiking	OXPHOS: ok so lets talk about this commit a bit :)
@wiking	i mean PR
 OXPHOS	wiking: sure yes there's still problem
@wiking	OXPHOS: ok so first of all this is wrong
@wiking	because you import the whole cereal codebase
@wiking	into shogun codebase
@wiking	do not do that
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: not yet..was making cereal to make sure it works
@wiking	OXPHOS: second: you started using STL in headers... please avoid that
@wiking	meaning why do you need std::vector
@wiking	to serialize an array of TYPENAME
@wiking	it's cool to the the thing with cereal
@wiking	the way eigen is dont
@wiking	*done
@wiking	i.e. add it as an external dependency if there's not cereal on the system
@wiking	but do not git add the cereal codebase to the shogun source
@wiking	(see your pr)
 OXPHOS	wiking: yes i know.  1. for external dependency i need a cereal.cmake right? or there's other ways
@wiking	OXPHOS: you should actually name it FindCereal.cmake
@wiking	just to be consistent with cmake modules
 OXPHOS	sure. and the vector -
@wiking	did you use this
@wiking	https://github.com/DURAARK/e57Extract/blob/master/cmake/modules/FindCereal.cmake
@wiking	?
 OXPHOS	aha no. didnt' try
@wiking	or i guess you used this
@wiking	https://github.com/kc5nra/sporkel/blob/master/ext/cereal.cmake
@wiking	beause this assumes
@wiking	that you have ceraal in your source tree
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	try to look around for FindCereal
@wiking	use stuff that is opensource
 OXPHOS	okay
@wiking	copying opensource stuff is not wrong
@wiking	it's actually encouraged
@wiking	:)
@lambday	haha ^
@lambday	:D
@wiking	lambday: ?
 OXPHOS	: ) so the vector - it was a T* vector that needs to be serialized
@wiking	lambday: dont you agree?
@lambday	wiking: of course.. unless it's GPL
@wiking	OXPHOS: yeah i know what needed to be done
 OXPHOS	I tried to convert it to a smart pointer, which gave error
@wiking	yep
@wiking	but we can 'teach' cereal
@wiking	how to serialize a T*
@wiking	no need for copy ctrs
@wiking	so first close this pr
@wiking	start a new one
@wiking	and add there as the beginning
@wiking	the cmake related stuff
@wiking	once we have that
@wiking	we'll switch to PoC stuff for objects
@wiking	ok?
 OXPHOS	sure
@wiking	tnx
 OXPHOS	was thinking modifying from that json.cmake
@wiking	the stuff you wrote in the md for cmake part
@wiking	was good
@wiking	that's fine
@wiking	OXPHOS: but again
@wiking	there's that one i found on github
@wiking	(FindCereal.cmake)
@wiking	that will serve you good
 OXPHOS	sure I didn't realize we can find such stuff. Thx!
@wiking	yeah yeah
@wiking	easy
@wiking	github is your friend
@wiking	(when it works)
@wiking	just search for findCereal
 OXPHOS	haha
@wiking	:)
@wiking	just ping me when you have the pr read
@wiking	*ready
 OXPHOS	wiking: np. thx!
@wiking	nw
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: for the cookbook - distance_braycurtis, canberra and canberraword? random pick
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: try algoerithms first
@HeikoS	before these "tools" such as distance are covered
@HeikoS	all classifiers and regression methods
@HeikoS	all clustering
@HeikoS	all preprocessing
@HeikoS	then distance and kernel
@HeikoS	wiking: about thread safety
@HeikoS	just talking with Saurabh7__
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	so the access methods of features
@HeikoS	we should ensure read-only
@HeikoS	on some of them
@wiking	const
@HeikoS	and hacking mutex for the ones that modify
@wiking	c++ is great for that
@HeikoS	yeah that is what I was thinking
@wiking	HeikoS: atomic is fine
@HeikoS	so need to clean up interface
@wiking	no need for mutex
@HeikoS	wiking: true
@HeikoS	wiking: so CFetaures needs const read methods
@wiking	yep
@wiking	best would be
@wiking	operators
@wiking	;)
@wiking	if you know what i mean
@HeikoS	so basically whenever we do things in parallel, we need to make sure all operators called from within are const
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: qda, ssk, clustering_hierarchical_modular?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah sure, I mean we can go on the fly -- all algos that are parallelised, we make sure to make all calls const
@wiking	operator[](index_t idx) const;
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__:  saw that ^
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: perfect :)
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS, yep
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: cool
@HeikoS	so this way we clean up things a bit on the fly
 arianepaola	:-)
@HeikoS	and allow the optimizer to be more efficient
@wiking	and to have cleaner code
@wiking	instead of
@wiking	cfeatures->get_feature_vector(2)
@wiking	:P
@wiking	cfeatures[2]
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: lets start with this x-validation then for week 1
@wiking	;P
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah actually good point
@wiking	i mean for god sakes
@wiking	this is c++
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: ^
@wiking	not java
@HeikoS	instance->get_weirdthing<another_weird_thing>()::interface
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	arianepaola: hi there!
 arianepaola	hi HeikoS
@HeikoS	arianepaola: how are things?
 arianepaola	HeikoS: good
@wiking	HeikoS: actually good question: what does swig do with operators :DDDD
@HeikoS	wiking: screw them up properly
@wiking	ah cool
@wiking	http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_nn28
@HeikoS	wiking: but such access methods do not even need to be exposed
@HeikoS	wiking: feats->get_feature_matrix()[i]
@HeikoS	arianepaola: had a chance to check a cookbook entry?
@wiking	http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_nn28
@wiking	HeikoS: ^ swig works nicely with such things
@wiking	;)
@HeikoS	wiking: well then
@HeikoS	wiking: had a chat to arianepaola about helping with release pip?
 arianepaola	HeikoS: have to add one
@wiking	HeikoS: not yet about that
@wiking	anybody used virt-install before?
@wiking	i need an aarch64 linux instance
@HeikoS	nope
@wiking	i mean = we need an aarch64 instance :P
@HeikoS	:P
@wiking	and aws is not good for such things :)
@HeikoS	wiking: btw what our current usage rate?
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	0.5 USD/day
@HeikoS	wiking: btw2, shall we maybe announce aws donation?
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	nice
@wiking	HeikoS: today it'll be more
@wiking	because i tested gpu instance
@HeikoS	i see
@wiking	but on average it is 0.5 usd/day
@wiking	so that should be good for anohter
@HeikoS	thats 150 / year
@wiking	87 year
@wiking	16000/0.5/365
@HeikoS	which is 100 times less that we needed
@wiking	or?
@HeikoS	even less haha
@wiking	so yeah but we have to use that within 1 year
@HeikoS	we can do lots of binary builds soon
@HeikoS	and also the cloud
@wiking	re: btw2 lets wait until we dont get the shogun-cloud back online
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	good idea
@HeikoS	and then announce together
@wiking	yep
