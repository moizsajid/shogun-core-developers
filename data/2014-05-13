@iglesiasg	Good morning people
-!- parijat [671b082a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.27.8.42] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	parijat, Hey parijat, I'm having a look at your PR atm
 parijat	iglesiasg: hi.. i see that you are reviewing my PR.. if you have any questions, I am available here in irc..
@iglesiasg	parijat, great, thanks
 parijat	iglesiasg: yup I saw!
@iglesiasg	parijat, for the moment all of them are more or less minor comments
@iglesiasg	parijat, but please have a look at the comment on line 152 of C45ClassifierTree
 parijat	iglesiasg: yup, I saw a few of them.. I will address them
@iglesiasg	parijat, maybe I misunderstood something of what's going on there
 parijat	iglesiasg: alright,, let me see.
@iglesiasg	parijat, not exactly on that line, pretty close
 parijat	iglesiasg: I think you are right there! if the last set of same labels has higher weight, its gooing to ignore that.
@iglesiasg	parijat, all right
 parijat	iglesiasg: I will fix this
@iglesiasg	parijat, I think you can correct if by pulling out the else if and making it an independent if within the for loop
 parijat	iglesiasg: yes exactly!
@iglesiasg	parijat, I compiled and tested your code locally btw
@iglesiasg	parijat, 0 leaks in valgrind :)
 parijat	iglesiasg: me too, I checked valgrind before sending in! ;)
 parijat	iglesiasg: btw, did you get any word about acceptance of your paper?
@iglesiasg	parijat, yes, yesterday night
@iglesiasg	parijat, they accepted it \o/
@iglesiasg	parijat, but I have to address some comments from reviewers
 parijat	iglesiasg: yo! calls for celebrations.
@iglesiasg	parijat, hehe yeah!
 parijat	iglesiasg: very nice! so you would be travelling somewhere to present the paper?
@iglesiasg	parijat, haha yeah
@iglesiasg	to Spain....
@iglesiasg	hahaha
@iglesiasg	funny thing
@iglesiasg	at least it is not to my city, although another city I've already been in. Salamanca
@iglesiasg	parijat, this if the conference: http://fusion2014.org/
 parijat	iglesiasg: haha! good good..
@iglesiasg	I'd prefer to visit a new place
 parijat	iglesiasg: oh! let me see..
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya, Im sure you will get many opportunities to visit new places, this is just the beginning..
 parijat	iglesiasg: you are right about data getting modified... I should probably restore the data matrix
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@103.240.206.190] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	parijat, ok, I should start going soon
@iglesiasg	parijat, I have left to look into entropy, informational_gain... and apply_multiclass_from_...
@iglesiasg	parijat, but I guess these are pretty much the same as in ID3, right?
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya almost! very few changes
@iglesiasg	parijat, I should be able to read them during the day anyway
@iglesiasg	parijat, nice job! :)
 parijat	iglesiasg: thanks! there are a few things that are yet to be done like missing values..
 parijat	iglesiasg: should I do these in this PR itself? or is it better to wait for this getting merged?
@iglesiasg	parijat, better wait, this PR is already large
@iglesiasg	parijat, remind me what these missing values are, please
 parijat	iglesiasg: i meant feature for handling missing values in C4.5
 parijat	iglesiasg: i have to add this. plus tree pruning
 parijat	iglesiasg: but this PR is complete in itself without these. So it wont be a problem if we merge this 1st and then go ahead adding the remaining things
@iglesiasg	parijat, I meant what the idea was behind handling missing values
@iglesiasg	parijat, I have bad memory :)
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok! the idea is that..
 parijat	iglesiasg: if we choose a data vector with unknown chosen attribute, we split the entire weight of the vector into fractions correponding to the possibility of the vector being moved to each of the child nodes
 parijat	iglesiasg: so basically we move the vector into all the children nodes of the current node, but the weight gets divided accordingly
 parijat	iglesiasg: did I make sense?
@iglesiasg	parijat, yep
 parijat	iglesiasg: sometimes what I say can be difficult to understand!! :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, if the attribute is unknown, how are the weights computed in each of the children?
@iglesiasg	parijat, the same for all of them?
@iglesiasg	I mean these possibilities you mentioned above
 parijat	iglesiasg: no, based on the ratio in which vectors with know attributes move into various children
@iglesiasg	parijat, ok
@iglesiasg	thanks
 parijat	iglesiasg: not a problem! :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, this is in some way semi-supervised learning, isn't it?
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya, in a way.. but not  entirely though I think.. its just extended to handle missing values
 parijat	iglesiasg: I too have to go now.. let me address your comments and update the PR

 lisitsyn	what do you think?

 kislay	hey pickle27 :)
 kislay	pickle27f, looks like some network problems you are suffering with!
 pickle27f	kislay, agh yeah this is my work computer
 pickle27f	macs are the worst at losing wifi and being weird about it
 kislay	pickle27f, haha :D
 kislay	pickle27f, I have been reading quite a lot about factory pattern!
 kislay	pickle27f, but there seems too unorganized content present!
 pickle27f	thats great - yeah don't over do it, you can probably start implementing the shogun opencv converter factories now
 kislay	oh. yeah . will love to!
 pickle27f	also can you take a look at the PR - we need to put OpenCV under a flag
 kislay	yes.
 kislay	I was about to look into it

 kislay	pickle27f, I couldn't understand the reason we need a flag. you mentioned there that if someone wants OpenCV integration and they don't have OPenCV installed, we need not give them warning. But why?
 pickle27f	we want OpenCV integration to be something the user specifies when configuring shogun
 pickle27f	the same way the user specifies if they want python
 pickle27f	we don't simply build python support if we can
 pickle27f	we only do it if asked
 pickle27f	we want the same for OpenCV
 pickle27f	so it needs to be behind a flag
 pickle27f	does that make sense?
 kislay	pickle27f, yup.
 pickle27f	that way the default build does not change at all and if they want OpenCV we'll try and add it
 pickle27f	if they want opencv but don't have it installed we'll say something about it
 kislay	oh! yeah
 kislay	okay. got it.
