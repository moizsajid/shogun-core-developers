 miniyou	Hi! I'm using cygwin and can't import modshogun in python. modshogun.py crashes on line 28, in swig_import_helper, on imp.load_module(). I have recreated the error manually: the file is found by imp.find_module(), but can't load it with an "ImportError: No such file or directory". Anyone seen something like this?  http://pastebin.com/6rtYcU4s
 miniyou	(Disregard lines 6-9 in the paste.) Also, a different question: where should cygshogun-17.dll be placed? After installing, it was only found in build/src/shogun directory. Copying it to current folder allows me to run the examples, but not placing it for example in shogun-install/lib. I've added that folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as instructed on https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
@lisitsyn	miniyou: not sure about the first question
@lisitsyn	but the second is simple
@lisitsyn	this .dll should be in whatever folder your system path includes
@lisitsyn	in linux it would be like /usr/lib
 miniyou	Yeah, that fixed the second question (I misread the path).
-!- kshitijk [~kshitijk@115.249.18.25] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
 miniyou	Solved it!
 miniyou	My hypothesis: I thought the "ImportError: No such file or directory" referred to not being able to load _modshogun.dll (even though there was an open filehandle to it!), but it was actually _modshogun.dll that was unable to load cygshogyn-17.dll
 miniyou	Before it was in a proper PATH dir

 miniyou	If that's the case I wouldn't have had the problem if cygshogun-17.dll had been placed in e.g. /usr/bin during install. Anyway, I was able to build and install in less than two days, nice! ;)
@lisitsyn	miniyou: I am sorry you had to spend that much time :)
@lisitsyn	glad to hear it is solved

@lambday	HeikoS: lisitsyn: hi
@lisitsyn	lambday: hey
@HeikoS	lambday: hi
@lambday	lisitsyn: I support HeikoS's "ML only GSoC next year"
@HeikoS	how are things?
@lisitsyn	lambday: sure
-!- Bluenotebook__ [~Bluenoteb@122.167.104.146] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: haha :) lets hope we can prepare ground for it
-!- Bluenotebook__ [~Bluenoteb@122.167.104.146] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@lambday	lisitsyn: HeikoS: 1. installation issues 2. tutorial 3. refactoring shogun
@lambday	about 3, we have plugin projects
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah these are all good
@HeikoS	if we have those things (and BSD) I also can get funding for hackathon
@HeikoS	and we can attract more people
@HeikoS	Just wonder who can do the installation issues
@HeikoS	.....
@HeikoS	because we kind of fail :)
@lambday	wiking:
@lambday	HeikoS: what do you mean by BSD? entire shogun under BSD instead of what we currently have?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lambday: we have this
@HeikoS	lambday:  see pm
@HeikoS	list of who signed to agree on BSD change
@lambday	hmm
@lambday	I think plugin way is the way to go for futuristic shogun..
@lambday	we have to figure out a shogun core
@lambday	and shogun apps or shogun extensions
@lambday	feature, kernel machine classifier etc go to core
@lambday	more sophisticated parts reside outside
@lambday	this closely relates to the detox idea we have

@lisitsyn	machine learning Q
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: how bad is PCA trained on say 2% of huge dataset?
@lisitsyn	I have a feeling that's pretty ok but I am not sure..

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that depends on the dataset
@HeikoS	what you could do is to run for increasing sizes and check whether solution stabilises, if it does, then you can probably get away with it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am thinking about making tapkee streaming
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: cool idea to check whether it stabilizes..
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: check my arxiv paper
@HeikoS	its on that topic
@HeikoS	how to correct for the error that one gets when doing the stabilisation trick
@HeikoS	and what to do if it doesnt stabilise
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: 2013?
@HeikoS	2014
@HeikoS	unbiased big bayes
@HeikoS	there are lots of plots where I did this for some models
@HeikoS	and then do something even better ;)
@lisitsyn	ok thanks I'll print it right now ;)
@lisitsyn	underground reading
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw people love command line data tools
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its easy to build them using shogun ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: tapkee was like header library for me but apparently it's sample (sic!) command line interface is used
@HeikoS	We can provide such tools in shogun too
@HeikoS	but thats kind of not the point
@HeikoS	I mean it would be good
@HeikoS	if we could maintain it ;)
