@sonney2k	blackburn, what do we need / want for shogun 1.2.0?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea
 blackburn	the only thing I can see for me is to submit this damned paper
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	yeah but abstracting from that
 blackburn	if I could hah
@sonney2k	we need an updated NEWS file
 blackburn	but heikos stuff is not ready
@sonney2k	and check our issues
@sonney2k	I don't know how far heiko is
@sonney2k	I mean we have this new swig 2.0.4 requirement
@sonney2k	we support -builtin in python
@sonney2k	new serialization
@sonney2k	and heikos migrations
 blackburn	there is no issue that I believe should done just now
 blackburn	be done*
@sonney2k	fixes fro c#, ruby configuration, GNB,
@sonney2k	if heikos stuff works too - then it is certainly sufficient for 1.2
 blackburn	okay
