@HeikoS	wiking: around?
@HeikoS	cfjhallgren: jojo
@wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	wiking: airbnb, see my meail
@HeikoS	emaio
@HeikoS	email
@HeikoS	wiking: should book today or so
@HeikoS	did you see the listings I sent back a while ago?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	i saw
 lisitsyn	meeh
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
 lisitsyn	hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: all good?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	you?
@HeikoS	all good here
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: are busy are you?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would love to have this cross-language integration testing going
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: a bit tired of being that kind of corporate slave :D
@HeikoS	for that, we need this guy here in the modular interfaces
 lisitsyn	ohh it sounds very boring
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/WrappedBasic.h
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/WrappedObjectArray.h
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/WrappedSGMatrix.h
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it is :)
@HeikoS	but it would be increase test coverage a lot
@HeikoS	which is  even more boring :D
 lisitsyn	Im dying
 lisitsyn	how can you put your spare time
 lisitsyn	on such a  b o r i n g thing
@HeikoS	its the last step of the meta examples
@HeikoS	then its done and I dont need to touch it again
@HeikoS	testing is solved in shogun
@HeikoS	so it is in anticipation of not spending time with testing anymore
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well I try again tomorrow
@HeikoS	you seem to change mood ;)
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	well
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: even more fun in the admin of the foundation
@HeikoS	because we did a formal mistake in the application
@HeikoS	so need to send again
@HeikoS	now THAT is meeeg
@HeikoS	h
 lisitsyn	oh fuck
 lisitsyn	I would kill myself
 lisitsyn	it is the definition of boresome
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what excites you these days?
@HeikoS	used to be different!
 lisitsyn	hahah
 lisitsyn	did I say I am fancy of doing *integration testing*? :P
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I would be happy to spend some time finishing get/set thingy
 lisitsyn	its kind of game changer
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	hey yeah
@HeikoS	that would be absolutely amazing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: finish it!
@HeikoS	get rid of all the shit
@HeikoS	make the plugins works
@HeikoS	wokr
@HeikoS	work
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so whats next step?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: all get/set patches merged?
@HeikoS	whats needed?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you know wiking and me will spend quite some time hacking shogun in two weeks
@HeikoS	can we help you?
 lisitsyn	probably not sure
 lisitsyn	I'd have to check the status
 lisitsyn	don't remember it by heart
@HeikoS	remember how the project ended?
@HeikoS	I think the parameter stuff is in right?
@HeikoS	it needs to be applied shogun wide now
 lisitsyn	kind of
 lisitsyn	there is a branch
 lisitsyn	not merged yet
 lisitsyn	if it is not merged it is lost
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	whats needed to merge it?
 lisitsyn	I am not even sure it is mergeable now
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	it is!
 lisitsyn	that's good

 CaBa	have the examples been adopted after the GaussianKernel paramter change from 'width' to 'log_width'?
 CaBa	gaussian_kernel_width=ModelSelectionParameters("log_width")
 CaBa	gaussian_kernel_width.build_values(-math.log(2.0), 0.0, R_EXP, 1.0, 2.0)
 CaBa	is this example actually a useful one?

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: merged it?
 lisitsyn	nono not yet
@HeikoS	so how can I help?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: unlikely I get time before this night
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	thats why I asked how can I help?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: nah just wait :)
@HeikoS	ok :)
@HeikoS	I want the game to be changed :)
 CaBa	O.O
@HeikoS	CaBa: big changes incoming ;)
 lisitsyn	let me just pass biyearly performance review wuhahhah
@HeikoS	and more payraises ;)
 CaBa	HeikoS: what's happening?
 lisitsyn	yes that's why
@HeikoS	CaBa: lisitsyn is getting a payraise ;)
@HeikoS	CaBa: and some GSoC fruits to be harvested
 CaBa	HeikoS: what's affected?
 CaBa	by the way, the parallel xval is for sure functional? i'm performing a rather large grid search and see no parallelization in effect there...
@HeikoS	CaBa: shoguns core architecture can be modernized then
@HeikoS	CaBa: I think it works
@HeikoS	you might have to set no of threads manually as detection might not work
 CaBa	HeikoS: how are the available threads distributed among the x-val and the machine?
@HeikoS	any_sg_object->get_global_parallel()->set_num_threads(12)
@HeikoS	CaBa: at the moment, we use a very crude approach
 CaBa	i think detection works because the SVM does use more than one thread
@HeikoS	but it is effective
 CaBa	hmmm... my process is pretty much at ~250 % cpu permanently...
@HeikoS	can you print the number of threads using the above?
 CaBa	on a 24 thread system
@HeikoS	I mean how many shogun has set
 CaBa	with the corresponding getter you mean?
@HeikoS	sg.GaussianKernel().get_global_parallel().get_num_threads()
@HeikoS	from Pythin
@HeikoS	for me returns 1
@HeikoS	even though I have 4
@HeikoS	so I need to
@HeikoS	In [6]: sg.GaussianKernel().get_global_parallel().get_num_threads()
@HeikoS	Out[6]: 1
@HeikoS	In [7]: sg.GaussianKernel().get_global_parallel().set_num_threads(4)
@HeikoS	In [8]: sg.GaussianKernel().get_global_parallel().get_num_threads()
@HeikoS	Out[8]: 4
@HeikoS	In [9]:
@HeikoS	and after the xvalidation uses 4 threads
@HeikoS	CaBa: let me know
@HeikoS	CaBa: btw this is xvalidation that is parallelised
@HeikoS	not the grid search (atm)
@HeikoS	CaBa: we could work on that if you want
 CaBa	right...
 CaBa	but parallelization is over folds, not runs, right?
@HeikoS	CaBa: check the code, ill send a link
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/evaluation/CrossValidation.cpp#L266
@HeikoS	so we could offer multiple strategies to parallelise
@HeikoS	over runs
@HeikoS	over folds
@HeikoS	over parameter sweeps
@HeikoS	CaBa: so over folds only really helps if each fold takes some time
 CaBa	HeikoS: number of threads reported is 24
@HeikoS	but then helps a lot
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	how many folds are you doing?
@HeikoS	how many runs?
@HeikoS	how many points does your grid have?
@HeikoS	24 folds is unlikely I guess ;)
@HeikoS	so we could add parallelisation over runs as well?
@HeikoS	or do it in the grid search
@HeikoS	whatever suits you
@HeikoS	you willing to send a patch?
@HeikoS	I can help
 CaBa	HeikoS: during model selection i use 1 run, 10 folds
@HeikoS	but the code in the link should give a good idea of how it works
@HeikoS	ok, so you cant fully exploit your setupo
 CaBa	so the folds won't run in parallel?
@HeikoS	they do
@HeikoS	check the link
@HeikoS	also tested etc
 CaBa	strange
@HeikoS	oh and only if machine is not locked
@HeikoS	can you check whether yours is locked?
 CaBa	HeikoS: CCrossValidation() is initialized with autolock=true
 CaBa	HeikoS: but i dont manually lock the machine anywhere
@HeikoS	can you set it to false and try?
@HeikoS	do you use a kernel machine there?
 CaBa	yes
 CaBa	svm
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	try disabling the autolock
@HeikoS	just for debugging
@HeikoS	then cpu should go up
@HeikoS	and then I can add parallel xvalidation for precomputed kernel matrices
@HeikoS	shouldnt be too hard
@HeikoS	and its good to have a use case from your side
 CaBa	HeikoS: indeed now i seem to have a higher CPU usage
@HeikoS	CaBa: ok!
 CaBa	HeikoS: ~660% instead of ~230%
@HeikoS	that's it then
@HeikoS	ironically, it might slower after all
@HeikoS	since kernel matrix is not precomputed now
@HeikoS	do you notice?
@HeikoS	but we can add that feature back in
@HeikoS	let me know
@HeikoS	gotta run now, but back later
 CaBa	can't say, the runs take me half a day
 CaBa	i'm really quite frustrated with that to be honest :(
 CaBa	ok, cool cu later

 Saurabh7	yello
 Saurabh7	CaBa: ckernel->get_kernel_matrix i think ..
 HeikoS1	Caba yes
 HeikoS1	thats it ^
 CaBa	thanks
 Saurabh7	HeikoS1: hey !
 Saurabh7	how are you
 CaBa	HeikoS1: is that a minor change to make the parallel xval work on locked machines?
 Saurabh7	ah yes that was left unfinished
 Saurabh7	I can attempt to do something this week :)

 Saurabh7	I had it working for locked iirc, but it was hackish, so HeikoS made me remove it :p
