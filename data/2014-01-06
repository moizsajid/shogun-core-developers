@iglesiasg	sonney2k, java modular is building now... sorry read this just now
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, btw, is there a way in cmake to turn off doxygen?
@iglesiasg	wiking, ^
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, probably..
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, enlighten me
@iglesiasg	because ccmake does not
@iglesiasg	I am not counting uninstalling doxygen as a nice solution...
@sonney2k	hurray we are going green https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun !
@iglesiasg	looking good
@iglesiasg	time to go to bed, first day of work coming up tom

 sonne|work	moin besser82!
 sonne|work	moin wiking!
 besser82	sonne|work:  moin sonne!  :D
 sonne|work	wiking, besser82: I found a way to build shogun modules out of tree with the current cmake (slightly patched...)
 sonne|work	I just rm -rf shogun
 sonne|work	and then symlink to the shogun includes dir
@wiking	sonne|work: hax0r!
 sonne|work	sure thing
 sonne|work	besser82: shogun 3.1.1 already fedorized?
 sonne|work	wiking: but it works and I can do the packages this evening
 sonne|work	so it is a good thing!
 besser82	sonne|work:  good, but fragile  :-P
 sonne|work	no no ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: 3.1.1 is fedorized  ;)
 sonne|work	excellent
 sonne|work	I can basically release pushing a button now :D
 besser82	sonne|work: :D
 sonne|work	besser82: should I create gpl'd 'tars too?
 sonne|work	so we can use them directly without mangliiiiing?

 besser82	sonne|work: btw. I'm nearly 95% for a CentOS6ized SHOGUN 3.1.1  :D
 besser82	sonne|work: RHEL6 / SciLi6, too  ;)

@sonney2k	evening gents!
@sonney2k	adrin, you have an old version of shogun somewhere installed
@sonney2k	adrin, remove it and recompile and all good
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, green wave https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun !
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: good job

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, time to do the notebook?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hey welcome?
@iglesiasg	sup
@sonney2k	!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, Re yesterday & java
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, things compile here so I am totally lost - I guess we should compare java / ant versions
@iglesiasg	all right
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so gimme what you have
@iglesiasg	java -version
@iglesiasg	java version "1.6.0_27"
@iglesiasg	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.12.6) (6b27-1.12.6-1ubuntu0.12.04.4)
@iglesiasg	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.0-b12, mixed mode)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, and no ant installed
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@sonney2k	java -version
@sonney2k	java version "1.7.0_25"
@sonney2k	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.3.10) (7u25-2.3.10-1~deb7u1)
@sonney2k	OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)
@sonney2k	ant -version
@sonney2k	Apache Ant(TM) version 1.8.2 compiled on September 22 2011
@sonney2k	besser82, which java version did you try with?
@iglesiasg	my java is way older, it might be that
 besser82	sonney2k:  javac 1.7.0_45
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hard to believe that it is that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, besser82 which cmake version?
@sonney2k	cmake --version
@sonney2k	cmake version 2.8.9
 besser82	sonney2k:  cmake version 2.8.12.1
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, cmake version 2.8.12.1
@sonney2k	hmm can you investigate further?
@sonney2k	I mean do you get *.java files at all?
 besser82	sonney2k:  my problem is with javac not wanting the "glob" in mf
@sonney2k	besser82, well can you do javac *.java if you go to that dir?
 besser82	sonney2k:  no
 besser82	sonney2k:  javac doesn't like globbing  :(
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, loads of java files under build/src/interfaces/java_modular/
 besser82	sonney2k:  when creating a proper mf by hand, javac starts to complain about not to find "Loader.class" in classpath
@sonney2k	besser82, that doesn't make sense... the glob stuff is done by the shell
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, can you manually do javac *.java there?
 besser82	sonney2k:  nope it is not done by shell  ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, sure
 besser82	sonney2k:  that requires some special bash-option to be set  ;)
@sonney2k	echo *.java
@sonney2k	wiking, you around?
 besser82	sonney2k:  echo works, but that is a shell built-in  :-P
@sonney2k	heh
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but I need to pass all the stuff by hand though, e.g. jblas, in addition to own Shogun deps
@sonney2k	besser82, what si the shell option then?
 besser82	sonney2k:  yeeeeeeeeeeesssssss..... a moment.....
 besser82	sonney2k:  shopt -s extglob  <---  but will work with bash, only AFAIK
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, what is the output of shopt | grep glob ?
@sonney2k	besser82, yours ?
@sonney2k	mine is extglob on!
 besser82	sonney2k:  extglob off
@iglesiasg	here goes mine!
@iglesiasg	dotglob        off
@iglesiasg	extglob        on
@iglesiasg	failglob       off
@iglesiasg	globstar       off
@iglesiasg	nocaseglob     off
@iglesiasg	nullglob       off
@wiking	yes
@wiking	around
@sonney2k	besser82, haha - it doesn't work for iglesias nor for you
@wiking	what can i help?
@sonney2k	and you have extglob off and he on
@sonney2k	wiking, yes
-!- zxtx_ is now known as zxtx
@sonney2k	wiking, java modular seems to not compile in some scenarios
@wiking	what seeeems to be the problem :)
@sonney2k	wiking, it works here for me
@wiking	ok what jdk
@wiking	r u guys using?
@sonney2k	wiking, openjdk
@wiking	hehehe
@sonney2k	see above
@wiking	sorry no help with that
@sonney2k	for me it works
@sonney2k	openjdk
@wiking	openjdk is a disaster
@sonney2k	for besser / iglesias not
@wiking	use oracle and have fun
@wiking	sonney2k: see exactly this is the reason i'm not using openjdk ever
@sonney2k	wiking, it works here with openjdk
@wiking	it's still unreliable
@wiking	yeah it works there
@wiking	but for some magical reason it does not work for them
@wiking	i'm like 100% sure that neither of them would have any problems with oracle jdk
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you please try with oracle / sun jdk?
@wiking	i'm sorry to be this harsh
@wiking	but i had just too many troubles with openjdk
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, oracle buuuh :P
@wiking	iglesiasg: but it works :S
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well lets see if this is the case...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if yes we can try to compile differently
@iglesiasg	let me try with it
@wiking	iglesiasg: is there any reason why u cannot use oracle's jdk?

@sonney2k	wiking, please have a look at my commit ^
@iglesiasg	wiking, no, not really
@wiking	iglesiasg: so then ... just use oracle's jdk
@wiking	(go with version 7)
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm is there a situation where u dont have in the checked out source src/interfaces/python_modular?

@wiking	apart from the case when u intentionally (why woudl u do that?) remove it?
@wiking	*would
@iglesiasg	wiking, sonney2k, if we are sure it will work with oracle jdk, then I can skip trying it
@wiking	iglesiasg: it workedforme
@iglesiasg	I am not going to be using java_modular just now in any case
@wiking	iglesiasg: :D
@wiking	sonney2k: what's the jdk on fatbot?
@wiking	hah lol it's ii  openjdk-6-jdk:amd64                                         6b27-1.12.6-1~deb7u1               amd64        OpenJDK Development Kit (JDK)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, we don't know
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I *never* had issues with openjdk
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, all right, will try it then
 lisitsyn	HEY
 besser82	sonney2k, wiking:  one simply cannot ship rpms build against Shitracle JDK in fedora  :(
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, HO?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: HO
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and?
 besser82	lisitsyn, sonney2k: all da N**g*z in da house, yeah!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am slow
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey homie
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Wassup, man?!?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: so you had your first working day?
@sonney2k	besser82, well it works with openjdk here so I suspsect sth else
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, yep
 lisitsyn	besser82: WAZZUP
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, full of scary equations :-O
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: sounds good!
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Man, da java_modular doesn't workz with da openJDK7 and wiking says use Shitracle, bro!
 lisitsyn	much better than seeing code
 lisitsyn	besser82: oh why?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  javac seems not to like globs in mf or on cli  :(
 lisitsyn	I can't say I had issues with openjdk
 besser82	lisitsyn:  and some more stuff, possibly
 besser82	lisitsyn:  which version?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: with any version
 besser82	sonney2k:  ^^^
 lisitsyn	I *can't* say
 lisitsyn	no issues
 lisitsyn	:)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  which are you currently using with java_modular?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I don't have java modular installed
 besser82	lisitsyn:  :(
 lisitsyn	java version "1.7.0_25"
 lisitsyn	OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.3.10) (7u25-2.3.10-1ubuntu0.13.04.2)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Can ya try 2 build it, bro?
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, works here with that version and also with 1.6* openjdk on the buildbot...
 lisitsyn	ich bin una de compileiro
 lisitsyn	wait for more novosti
 besser82	lisitsyn:  hehe, speutsch  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  and Ruglish
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's the usual yazyk for me
@sonney2k	besser82, Runglish!
@sonney2k	strongest level of cryptography!
@sonney2k	besser82, btw what is you cmake state?
 besser82	sonney2k:  Still WIP  :(  Fighting with CMake28 on el5  :(
@sonney2k	and guys think about some ideas for a slogan for the next release
@sonney2k	hey gsomix!
@sonney2k	nice to see you here
 lisitsyn	the worst release evarr
 lisitsyn	people should like irony
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, Free of bugtz
 lisitsyn	anyone is up to discuss plugins and parameters?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, likely besser82 wants to join the fight club
* sonney2k is missing with some python debian package
 besser82	lisitsyn:  pluginz?!?  Here me goes :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  btw. any chance to see see you on devconf?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: when?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  in Brno 6.2. - 9.2.
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	no probably not
 besser82	lisitsyn:  If you wanna come, I'm there  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  With some of me rh-buddies  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I want but :)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  back to da pluginz  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah so
 lisitsyn	I googled a bit before
 lisitsyn	I came across boost.extension
 lisitsyn	of course I don't propose to use it but we have to take a look ;)
@iglesiasg	wiking, how can I tell cmake to use a java version that is intalled somewhere under /opt?
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay and what I found is this
 lisitsyn	http://blog.redshoelace.com/2014/01/c0x.html
 lisitsyn	6 days back post that causes some thoughts
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
 besser82	lisitsyn:  yes, but he doesn't use dynamic loaded so  :(
 besser82	lisitsyn:  thats the point  :(
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay lets just think what are alternatives
 lisitsyn	to be sure we are on the right track
 besser82	lisitsyn:  perfectly every other alternative is slower than loading so-plg
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, woahh!
 lisitsyn	this is not a point for me to be honest
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the guy who wrote boost extensions?
 besser82	sonney2k:  ????
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes
 besser82	lisitsyn:  should we go about performance in shogun?!? <--- sonney2k
 lisitsyn	performance is not in calls
@sonney2k	besser82, yes of course otherwise we won't be able to handle billions of data points
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, true
@sonney2k	it is internal usually
 lisitsyn	the only thing that should be considered is like classifier -> features
 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: and stuff like passing the data to the methods ;)
 lisitsyn	otherwise it is ok to spend well a second to instantiate something
 lisitsyn	or whatever
 besser82	sonney2k, lisitsyn: and that where I see realy problems when using some RPC or whatever
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hmm some particular directory inside the java dir?
 lisitsyn	okay actually I still think it would be cool to have client-server shogun :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk.1.7.0_45 didn't quite work out
 besser82	lisitsyn:  c-s would be cool, but....
 besser82	lisitsyn:  which middleware?
 lisitsyn	besser82: e.g. zmq
 besser82	lisitsyn:  ain't that a bit oldschool?!? I dunno, just heard the name somewhen
 lisitsyn	besser82: hmm well it is just about message passing or any other technique
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, that is what I use export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, mm I think I might need to start a clean cmake dir
 besser82	lisitsyn:  there are some cooler ways to pass msg  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  like tossing in sth like openShift / openStack  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: ?? doesn't make sense for me
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Why?
 lisitsyn	that's way too restrictive
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yep, that was it. New build directory and the right ones were found by cmake
 besser82	lisitsyn:  restrictive?  GPL is restrictive?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well and zmq is proven high-speed ;)
 lisitsyn	no, any specific platform is restrictive
 besser82	lisitsyn:  kk, but with those we could play some scalable client - server game  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  on a well maintainer && prooven to work platform
 lisitsyn	besser82: I don't know - needs more research
 besser82	lisitsyn:  we could deploy ready to ouse docker
 besser82	lisitsyn:  and all that nice stuff  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  and if there is probs I know like da 20 upstream devs  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  but how do we want to do the layout of the plugins?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: good question
 besser82	lisitsyn:  every feature / kernel / ...  in an own plugin, like wiking suggested?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah I think so
 besser82	sonney2k:  ^^^^^  (+1/-1)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  +1
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, did it build through?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, 27% atm
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, besser82  - that or group by class e.g. kernels
 besser82	sonney2k:  group or single?!?
 lisitsyn	I propose common interfaces stay in the core
 lisitsyn	like kernel/feature/etc
 besser82	sonney2k:  Fremde oder Freunde, wie wird alles sein  :-P
 lisitsyn	but any concrete thing goes as a plugin
 besser82	lisitsyn:  Yeah, we need to have the "common" types into the interf-lib

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, damn it

@iglesiasg	but why oh why: javac: file not found: /home/iglesias/workspace/shogun-csharp/build/src/interfaces/java_modular/*.java
@iglesiasg	there are plenty of java files there
 besser82	iglesiasg:  that is because your version of javac doesn't support globs, like mine  ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if you do that command on the cmdline - does it work?
@sonney2k	besser82, it is oracle jdk
 besser82	sonney2k:  i see
 besser82	sonney2k:  but that is the error me gets with openJDK's javac, too
@sonney2k	yup
@sonney2k	no id
 besser82	sonney2k:  so it actually isn't just the problem of openJDK  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, well it works on the buildbot and here with openjdk

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: create a manifest without globs inside
@sonney2k	besser82, does that work ^
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, let me try too
@sonney2k	besser82, would be an easy fix
 besser82	iglesiasg:  try this ^^^ with openJDK  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k:  for me it works when building the jar  ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, nice then wait for iglesiasg and merge :)
@sonney2k	guys sry but I am overly tired already - keep it going!
 besser82	sonney2k:  but ...

 besser82	lisitsyn:  ^^^  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  hahahaha
 lisitsyn	I don't know russian programming
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	ahh okay
 lisitsyn	I know
 besser82	lisitsyn:  still need LANG="c"?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: jblas doesn't care whether it is an sgvector or sgmatrix
 besser82	lisitsyn:  ?!?
 lisitsyn	in jblas they are all matrices
 besser82	lisitsyn:  yes, but then it should work anyways, but how?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: the question is why we have sgvector here
 besser82	lisitsyn:  That's not my topic, uunfortunately  :(
@iglesiasg	besser82, so the fix didn't work out, right?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I can take a look
 besser82	iglesiasg:  the fix itself yes, but for me that is another problem ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, will try myself then
 besser82	lisitsyn:  many thank
 besser82	iglesiasg:  did you build already?!?
@iglesiasg	besser82, no way. It is in progress.
@iglesiasg	I removed build dir again since the change was in cmake
@iglesiasg	so build restarted from zero
 lisitsyn	besser82: please email me
 lisitsyn	/home/besser82/shared/git/shogun/build/src/interfaces/java_modular/modshogunJAVA_wrap.cxx
 besser82	lisitsyn:  the whole file?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah probably
 besser82	lisitsyn:  can i gzip?
 lisitsyn	yeah sure sure
 besser82	lisitsyn:  what's ya email addy?
 lisitsyn	besser82: blackburn91@gmail.com is ok
 besser82	lisitsyn:  kk
 besser82	lisitsyn:  just rebuiding because I accidently killed the build-dir
@iglesiasg	besser82, [100%] Creating Java archive shogun_jar.jar
@iglesiasg	'c' flag requires manifest or input files to be specified!
 besser82	iglesiasg:  please recompile with cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
 besser82	iglesiasg:  and give me the line which gets invoked when this shows up, plz
 besser82	lisitsyn:  mail's out
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah thanks
 besser82	lisitsyn:  xz'ed that 11MB file to ~250 kbytes  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay it can haz some sgvectorz
 lisitsyn	da Q iz why
 besser82	lisitsyn:  lets look @ da blamelist...
 lisitsyn	besser82: makes no sense..
 besser82	lisitsyn:  what makes no sense?!?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  da vectorz
 lisitsyn	besser82: why it has sgvector instead of sgmatrix
 besser82	lisitsyn:  The real q is who changed that?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no nothing is changed
 besser82	lisitsyn:  but why then there are sgvectorz?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: swiggzzzz
 besser82	lisitsyn:  no me swigggzzzz is ok
 besser82	lisitsyn:  i use da most recent git cehckout pre-alpha  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn:  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  no, not really...
