 sonne|work	wiking: yes?
@wiking	sonne|work: got some minuts?
 sonne|work	wassup?
@wiking	sonne|work: 1) freebsd bot with python_modular
@wiking	sonne|work: it will fail for sure but let's add it and we'll try to fix it somehow
 sonne|work	so just install the dependencies and make sure that it compiles locally
 sonne|work	then I can enable it
 sonne|work	with the settings you give me
@wiking	sonne|work: 2) librt (random forest implementation) can only handle binary labelling.... and afaik random forest should be able to do multiclass, or?
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah well this is my current problem
@wiking	sonne|work: for python_modular + freebsd: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1023
@wiking	sonne|work: ideas?
@wiking	sonne|work: i mean the first 2 things it's easy to fix...
@wiking	sonne|work: but i have no clue what the last error is and how it could be fixed
@wiking	sonne|work: that's the output when u try to do ./configure --interfaces=python_modular && make on freebsd bot
 sonne|work	sth weird is going on
 sonne|work	you are on a 64bit machine
 sonne|work	but use only 32bit it seems
@wiking	sonne|work: i haven't touched anything apart from this in ./configure script
@wiking	http://pastebin.com/Hth9x1Tq
 sonne|work	sure but this is the reason
@wiking	any ideas where i could start fixing this problem?
-!- deerishi_ [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
@wiking	i mean all the libraries are 64 bit
@wiking	on that fbsd bot
 sonne|work	it is easy to get it to compile
@wiking	so i don't even know why it tries to use 32bit
 sonne|work	but that would be more of a workaround
 sonne|work	yeah
 sonne|work	it should use 64bit
 sonne|work	the error you are getting is basically saying swig's int/long etc data types are just 32bit
 sonne|work	and I forced this define on on 64bit machines
 sonne|work	because swig doesn't inherit included #defines
@wiking	/usr/local/bin/swig2.0: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (FreeBSD), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for FreeBSD 9.1, not stripped

@wiking	sonne|work: btw: am i right about random forest? or it is really just binary?
 sonne|work	random forest == bagged decision tree
 sonne|work	so you can do anything
 sonne|work	binary / mc
 sonne|work	regression
 sonne|work	etc
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	then librt sucks :(
@wiking	as the labeling it accepts atm is only 0,1,-1

@wiking	yeah i have no clue
@wiking	i'll check what weka uses

 sonne|work	http://www.mers.byu.edu/docs/standardC/limits.html#LONG_MAX
@wiking	sonne|work: where do we save __WORDSIZE ?
 sonne|work	wiking: according to wikipedia LONG_MAX is related to long, it is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_data_types
 sonne|work	and INT_MAX to int
@wiking	mmmm
-!- deerishi [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]

 sonne|work	#endif
@wiking	yes
 sonne|work	so __WORDSIZE == 32!
@wiking	no
 sonne|work	no?
@wiking	i mean i've just ran ./configure
 sonne|work	then LONG_MAX == INT_MAX
@wiking	and it's output is 64 bits
 sonne|work	so sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)
 sonne|work	can you check that?
@wiking	so imo __WORDSIZE = 64
@wiking	yep just a sec
 sonne|work	oops gtg, will be around in the evening

@wiking	wencan: fork a repository for yourself
@wiking	and do there the changes
@wiking	commit and push it there
 wencan	Ok. That's fine.
@wiking	and then submit a pull request for the develop branch
@wiking	mikhailBelous: and?
@wiking	mikhailBelous: i mean with that error it still should wokr
@wiking	*work
 mikhailBelous	okey, so it's mean I made some other mistake installing
@wiking	well what do you try to test

@sonney2k	thoralf, whats up?
@sonney2k	mikhailBelous, pong
@sonney2k	wiking, that is indeed weird
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah kind of like have no clue wtf
@sonney2k	wiking, could you please grep in the swig headers for that message
@sonney2k	wiking, and add a #warning macro there
@sonney2k	to print out the values?
@wiking	sonney2k: lol?!
@sonney2k	wiking, but it is this difficult to get the actual values: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12637392/c-preprocessor-expand-macro-in-a-warning
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean i've just deleted from that macro check
@wiking	#if (__WORDSIZE == 32) || (LONG_MAX == INT_MAX)
@wiking	__WORDSIZE == 32
@sonney2k	and?
@wiking	and now it's compiling
@wiking	so WTF?
@sonney2k	ahh WORDSIZE=32?
@wiking	but where does it get it
@wiking	i have noooo idea
@wiking	because as u can see from that dummy example
@wiking	there wordsize == 64
@wiking	so somewher it gets redefined
 thoralf	sonney2k: Just sent a mail to the mailing list.
@wiking	oookeey
@wiking	sonney2k: clang++ -fPIC -g -O0 -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=shogun -DSHOGUN -DFREEBSD -DUSE_BOOL -DUSE_CHAR -DUSE_UINT8 -DUSE_UINT16 -DUSE_INT32 -DUSE_INT64 -DUSE_UINT64 -DUSE_FLOAT32 -DUSE_FLOAT64 -DHAVE_SQRTL -DHAVE_LOG2 -DHAVE_PTHREAD -DHAVE_JSON -DHAVE_XML -DHAVE_ATLAS -DHAVE_LAPACK -DHAVE_CATLAS -DHAVE_EIGEN3 -DUSE_GLPK -DUSE_SNAPPY -DUSE_GZIP -DUSE_BZIP2 -DUSE_LZMA -DHAVE_LARGEFILE -DUSE_SHORTREAL_KERNELCACHE -DUSE_BIGSTATES -DUSE_HMMCACHE -DUSE_REFERENCE_CO
@wiking	wit this
@wiking	__WORDSIZE = 32
@wiking	so i'm guessing somewhere in those headers __WORDSIZE is redefined
@wiking	i'm trying now a grep -r __WORDSIZE /usr/local/*
@wiking	but no help...
@wiking	it's not defined anywhere there
@wiking	just used
@sonney2k	wiking, but how can it be defined then?
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm still wondering
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i think i found it
@sonney2k	http://repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu/crossref/heccer/usr/include/limits.h.html
@wiking	http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2013-March/052039.html
@wiking	;)
@sonney2k	there is wordsize in there
@wiking	clang++ test.cc -o test -> wordsize = 32
@wiking	clang test.c -o test -> wordsize = 64
@wiking	__wordsize is not a portable macro apparently
@wiking	(at least in freebsd stdint.h :P)
@sonney2k	wiking, crazy
@wiking	 /* GNU and Darwin define this and people seem to think it's portable */
@sonney2k	so now what
@wiking	from /usr/include/stdint.h
@sonney2k	swig uses it
@sonney2k	it is used in limits.h
@sonney2k	wiking, is it used in limits.h in fbsd too?
@wiking	noup
@wiking	i mean not __WORDSIZE
@wiking	that's some linux hacko
@wiking	;)
@sonney2k	wiking, so it is undefined?
@wiking	well not undefined
@wiking	as u can see it's defined in stdint.h
@wiking	but as it says that bug i've just pasted
@wiking	it's not the most reliable macro
@wiking	on freebsd
@wiking	see clang++ and clang output
@wiking	;)
@sonney2k	wiking, how about you forcefully define __WORDSIZE=64 ?
@sonney2k	wiking, try to add this to the -D defines list
@wiking	sonney2k: same behavoir for g++46
@wiking	sonney2k: you mean clang++ -D__WORDSIZE=64 test.cc -o test
@wiking	?
@wiking	as it doesn't help unfortunately
@wiking	it's still 32
@sonney2k	wiking, so where is it defined then?
@wiking	sonney2k: as i said
@sonney2k	it must be somewhere in /usr/**.h
@sonney2k	where?
@wiking	in /usr/include/stdint.h
@wiking	but it's aint reliable
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but how is it defined there?
@wiking	#if defined(UINTPTR_MAX) && defined(UINT64_MAX) && (UINTPTR_MAX == UINT64_MAX)
@wiking	#define __WORDSIZE              64
@wiking	#else
@wiking	#define __WORDSIZE              32
@wiking	#endif
@wiking	and one of those is not defined in c++ case
@sonney2k	*sigh*
@sonney2k	so it is overridden
@sonney2k	but it looks good to me
@wiking	yeah but still
@wiking	according to the bug
@wiking	However the way it's defined is utterly unsafe: when UINTPTR_MAX or UINT64_MAX are not defined (which is the case for C++, as their definitions in e.g. x86/_stint.h are wrapped in
@wiking	if !defined(__cplusplus) || defined(__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS)
@wiking	__WORDSIZE is always defined as 32, which is wrong on 64bit systems.
@wiking	:(
@sonney2k	wiking, could you please try -D__LP64__ too
@sonney2k	?
@wiking	clang++ -D__WORDSIZE=64 -D__LP64__ test.cc -o test
@wiking	[wiking@sandbox ~]$ ./test
@wiking	8 4
@wiking	9223372036854775807 2147483647
@wiking	32
@sonney2k	wiking, please print the 3 values above
@sonney2k	UINTPTR_MAX
@sonney2k	UINT64_MAX
@sonney2k	two actually :D
@wiking	test.cc:13:15: error: use of undeclared identifier 'UINTPTR_MAX'
@wiking	        std::cout << UINTPTR_MAX << " " << UINT64_MAX << std::endl;
@wiking	                     ^
@wiking	test.cc:13:37: error: use of undeclared identifier 'UINT64_MAX'

@sonney2k	wiking, cool - so define both to 0xffffffffffffffff
@sonney2k	wiking, or alternatively include stdint.h and define __LP64__
@sonney2k	#ifdef __LP64__

 gsomix	hi, guys
@wiking	clang++ -DUINTPTR_MAX=0xffffffffffffffff -DUINT64_MAX=0xffffffffffffffff test.cc -o test
@wiking	that works
 gsomix	ehm, and girls :)
@wiking	sonney2k: that macro works only on linux
@wiking	sonney2k: we'll have to go with -DUINTPTR_MAX=0xffffffffffffffff -DUINT64_MAX=0xffffffffffffffff
@wiking	on fbsd
@sonney2k	wiking, ok so try if it compiles then...
@sonney2k	and even runs sth
 gsomix	sonney2k: good evening. so, I'm finally writing proposal for I/O project.

@lisitsyn	ahh yes let me check it then

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: no, I did actually put there a regression data file for newly added test

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I should issue reset HEAD~1 in data submodule I guess?
@lisitsyn	if you commited there yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: updated
@lisitsyn	good job
@lisitsyn	let me wait for travis and then I'll merge
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: sure. I am thinking of trying to implement some DR method now. What is your opinion?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: if you feel ok porting not the best C++ code I have something
 vgorbati	 lisitsyn: sure
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: that could be a guide for adding a new method: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1025
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yeah, I saw it)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: http://waffles.sourceforge.net/
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: what about SOM?
@lisitsyn	kohonen
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: or manifold sculpting
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: regarding your words, ' provided in a clean C++ library' is a lie?:) (text on their main page)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: SOM sound good for me
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: no it is pretty clean I think but slow
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: eigen3 based code is faster
@lisitsyn	and mike gashler uses ehm strange methods for eigendecompositions
@lisitsyn	but other code must be ok
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: SOM looks pretty big
@lisitsyn	lets rather go for manifold sculping
@lisitsyn	sculpting
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: at least I have heard about it:) is manifold sculpting smaller?
@lisitsyn	yes pretty small
 vgorbati	lisitsyn:got it
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: SOM in waffles is like >1.5K LoC
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: and it is present in the 'Waffles', right?
@lisitsyn	yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yeah, it will probably require implementing some base class for neural network, etc.
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: SOM I mean
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	and it is not like classic dimension reduction
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess there's no eigendecompositions there)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: no not only that
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: SOM is all-to-all neural network IIIRC?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: or no, it is hopfield's net
@lisitsyn	I do not remember exactly
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: it has connections from all feature nodes to all mapping space nodes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: it is not that typical because it maps to some 10 x 10 space or sth like that
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: anyway, maybe it will be the next DR. I will start working on sculpting from tomorrow then
@lisitsyn	sounds like a plan

@lisitsyn	no I mean plan for that week for now

@wiking	:P
@sonney2k	wiking, well then so just add this workaround to configure
@sonney2k	wiking, we have a freebsd() function there
@sonney2k	and if wordsize is 64 just add these defines

@sonney2k	van51, there were lots of checks failing when the result was NULL
@sonney2k	but in fact 0 meant - no error
@sonney2k	wiking, I've added some better diff to determine the error we have w/ travis in tester.py
@sonney2k	wiking, now it will print the original / expected values
@sonney2k	and also a diff
@sonney2k	lets hope that helps...

@sonney2k	van51, just look at the diff of my commit above
 van51	ok
@sonney2k	van51, but we might still have the leak with the filename

@sonney2k	comma
@sonney2k	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/6739254
 van51	hehe what for? haven't done anything yet :p
@sonney2k	van51, we have one test failing on travis-ci but not our own buildbot
@sonney2k	difference is ~1e-14
 van51	and that error comes from deserialization?
 van51	also please avoid writing "failing" after my name.. i'm getting nervous :p
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm lemme check as well
@wiking	sonney2k: any ideas what could be the underlying cause
@wiking	?
@wiking	btw: i couldn't find any freebsd specific function/variable in the configure script
