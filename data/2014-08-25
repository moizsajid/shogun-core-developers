 xony	Hey
 xony	I want to use a string kernel on strings which have an alphabet larger than 255
 xony	according to the documentation of CStringFeatures:
 xony	"As this class is a template the underlying storage type is quite arbitrary and not limited to character strings, but could also be sequences of floating point numbers etc."
@wiking	xony: i reckon u should rather try to send anemail to the mailinglist
 xony	ah okay
 xony	thank you
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	maybe somebody will be ehre but there's a better chance u get an answer

@besser82	xony, did you try wchar* already?!?
@besser82	xony, wchar should be able to represent UTF-{8,16} strings
 xony	besser82: no i did not. but when creating an alphabet for example the constructor takes a char*
 xony	i was wondering if i can use an integer representation and use StringIntFeatures()
@besser82	xony, that would be another possibility...
@besser82	xony, you are not using C++?
@besser82	xony, which lang do you use?

@besser82	xony, on the other hand you may try to create a custom instance of CStringFeatures<wchar>
@besser82	and then create the sample alphabet on this
 xony	besser82: i currently use modular python
@besser82	xony, I see...
@besser82	xony, then you should be able to pass in python's unicode  (on Py2)
@besser82	xony, or python::string (for Py3)
 xony	besser82: do i need to build a custom alphabet then with Alphabet() ?
@besser82	xony, I don't think so...
@besser82	xony, that should be handled by the constructor then...
@besser82	xony, as long as your alpha is conform to the alpha-representation of that python data-type...
@besser82	afk ---> lunch...
 xony	thank you, i will try this out and report back!
