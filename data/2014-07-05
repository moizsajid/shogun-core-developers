 Platyp	Hi, I've downloaded shogun and am trying to install it from source, but I can't find a configure file
 Platyp	The download from this page (http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/new/40) didn't have one

 lisitsyn	Platyp: hey
 Platyp	Hello
 lisitsyn	Platyp: there is no configure thing anymore as we are using cmake
 lisitsyn	just create a directory called e.g. 'build'
 lisitsyn	cd build && cmake ..
 Platyp	Ah, so http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/installation.html is out of date
 Platyp	thanks
 lisitsyn	Platyp: oh absolutely
 lisitsyn	should be updated sorry about that

 lisitsyn	Platyp: actually it is updated but for some reason there is only 3.0.0 doc
 lisitsyn	it is a known issue though - I have seen some attempts to fix that in the mailing list
 Jiaolong_	hushell: Hello
 Platyp	Yeah, I mean the entire wiki is labeled 3.0.0
 Platyp	So are 3.2.0 docs available anywhere?
 hushell	Jiaolong_: hey

 lisitsyn	Platyp: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/install.html
 lisitsyn	Platyp: should be better
 Jiaolong_	hushell: this truncation only changes input of graph cuts
 Platyp	Aha
 Platyp	I wonder how I got to the 3.0.0 page
 Platyp	I'll try to find the link
 Platyp	Thank you very much
 Jiaolong_	hushell: it doesn't change energy table in the factor graph
 hushell	Jiaolong_: I mean it changes energy table to make a submodular function
 Jiaolong_	hushell: I have compired to tree max product
 Jiaolong_	hushell: yes
 lisitsyn	Platyp: you're welcome
 hushell	Jiaolong_: let me finish the email
 Jiaolong_	hushell: OK

 princearora	hi all.....i am new to shogun and am interested in contributing to Shogun....
 princearora	i have gone through the list of ideas on the Shogun GSoC ideas page and like the Dictionary Learning idea and am very interested in developing it....
 princearora	i know its late for GSoC but i will like to pursue this project out of GSoC.....
 princearora	can some please point me it the right direction for making a good proposal!!
 thor|alf	Hey princearora
 princearora	hey thor|alf
 thor|alf	princearora: Let me check who suggested this idea.
 princearora	thor|alf : Sergey Lisitsyn
 princearora	but he is away at this moment...
 princearora	thor|alf, can you please give me some references where i may read and acquaint myself about this topic and understand the scope and idea of this project
 thor|alf	princearora: How much do you know about the dictionary problem already?
 princearora	thor|alf, well....not much!!
 princearora	thor|alf, i shall introduce myself...
 princearora	i am a third year undergraduate student of Computer Science from India....
 thor|alf	princearora: Which region?
 thor|alf	:)
 princearora	thor|alf, i am from AK Garg Engineering COllege, Ghaziabad...
 thor|alf	princearora: We have two other students from India this year.

 princearora	thor|alf, ohh....
 princearora	thor|alf, sorry i came to learn about GSoC a bit late...
 princearora	thor|alf, but i suppose i can always contribute outside of GSoC....
 princearora	as I was saying i have had courses in Artificial Intelligence, and Algorithms....
 princearora	and am very eager to apply my knowledge to real-world open-source projects...
 thor|alf	princearora: Well, back to your problem.  I guess you should try to find a basic paper to learn the terminology... meanwhile you should prepare an email to the list , introduce yourself and suggest that you want to work on it.
 thor|alf	princearora: The subscription address is shogun-list-subscribe@shogun-toolbox.org
 princearora	thor|alf, thanks....i shall do that......any paper you have in mind which I should go through first to learn this technique??
 thor|alf	princearora: Btw., getting involved now is a good start for being accepted next year, because you already know the stuff. :)
 thor|alf	princearora: Unfortunately I don't know anything about dictionary learning.
 thor|alf	*nothing* :D
 rajul	hi princearora
 princearora	hi rajul
 rajul	i have found this course on Dictionary Learning http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/mldict.html....you may ind this useful!!
 thor|alf	princearora: Maybe you can check scikit learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.DictionaryLearning.html
 thor|alf	J. Mairal, F. Bach, J. Ponce, G. Sapiro, 2009: Online dictionary learning for sparse coding (http://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/pdfs/icml09.pdf)
 princearora	rajul, thor|alf , thanx I will go through these...

 lisitsyn	princearora: hey
 lisitsyn	princearora: I think that simplest idea would be just to develop some basic algorithms
 lisitsyn	e.g. the ones available in scikit learn
 thor|alf	Hey Sergey
 princearora	hi lisitsyn
 princearora	can you please guide me about what these basic algorithms should be and where can i look for them??
