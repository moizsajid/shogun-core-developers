 lisitsyn	HeikoS: reading this thing :)
 lisitsyn	honestly I am totally lost
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its online now
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: just published
@HeikoS	hahahah
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	thats the point ;)
@HeikoS	no if you have expliciut comments, let me know
@HeikoS	ill change
@HeikoS	its pretty involved I have to admit
@HeikoS	technical stuff for technical problems
 lisitsyn	ohh my head
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: tell me how to use it :D
@HeikoS	Any Bayesian inference problem with intractable likelihoods ;)
@HeikoS	For example, a GP
@HeikoS	classifier
@HeikoS	But try simple methods first
@HeikoS	only if they dont work, use this
 lisitsyn	bayesian inference problem with intractable likelihoods
 lisitsyn	you must be kidding
@HeikoS	haha
 lisitsyn	do you know what drives all banners in the world?
@HeikoS	The while fields only exists because people need phds
@HeikoS	this is science
 lisitsyn	haha yes that's probably true
@HeikoS	not ML for making money
@HeikoS	no banners invovled
 lisitsyn	no I am just talking from my point of view
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I do want to gain from academia
 lisitsyn	but I meet bayesian inference problem with intractable likelihoods :D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no actually you're a hero
 lisitsyn	because you don't do neural networks
 lisitsyn	it takes some brave
@HeikoS	there is a neural network version of my paper
@HeikoS	http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05555
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: same thing as mine, but not using kernels but NNs instead
 lisitsyn	hah
@HeikoS	but  I can prove some guarantees that they cannot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: logistic regression is a bayesian inference problem with an intractable likelihood btw
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh you speak english again :)
@wiking	buuu
@wiking	so yueah would be great if we could move the thing with one more hour
@wiking	i keep falling asleep :(
@wiking	hahahahahahahah
@wiking	best quote
@wiking	13:58 < lisitsyn> HeikoS: no actually you're a hero
@wiking	13:58 < lisitsyn> because you don't do neural networks
@wiking	13:59 < lisitsyn> it takes some brave
@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	wiking: haha :)
