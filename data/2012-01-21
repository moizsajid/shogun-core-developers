 blackburn	sonney2k: going to come up with some new ideas in next few days
 Ram108	blackburn: is there a template or somethn of that sort to write programs that makes it look like it belongs to shogun?
 blackburn	Ram108: not realyl
 Ram108	oh hmmm okay thanks :)
 blackburn	Ram108: you mean something like python script template?
 Ram108	hw was ur exam by the way? hope u did it well :)
 Ram108	yeah exactly tailor made for shogun
 blackburn	yeah, got 4/5
 Ram108	cool :)
 Ram108	well does the script template exist?
 blackburn	no,not really
 Ram108	oh okay thanks :)
 Ram108	am working on back propagation algorithm
 blackburn	I see
 Ram108	so i thought since thats not implemented that might be of some help.........
 blackburn	hmm yes that would be some simple feature nice to have to
 Ram108	lol :P
 blackburn	it should be done as some class in shogun/classifier
 Ram108	oh hmmm okay
 blackburn	Ram108: have you ever read the sources btw?
 Ram108	just went through them once but didnt pay much attention.
 Ram108	i ll go thru em nw
 Ram108	well so which does back propagation pertain to? classifier or clustering.............? can be made to work as both right?
 blackburn	are you sure it is possible to use back prop for clustering?
 Ram108	well i have tried it once and it sorta worked but crude......... and its best for classification......... so its best to be categorised as that i guess
 Ram108	well let me get on with the code and finish it asap
 Ram108	good night :) bye :)
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	see you
 Ram108	:)
