@wiking	OXPHOS: so
@wiking	have u seen the tagging PR?
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3368#issuecomment-232271475
@wiking	but anyhow either way we go
@wiking	the archiver functions load/save should only be implemented in SGObject
 OXPHOS	wiking till now
 OXPHOS	sure
@wiking	and of course for the ones
@wiking	that are not derivatives of SGObject
@wiking	like sgvect
@wiking	or
 shogun-buildbot	build #2940 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2940  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Sanuj <sanuj.sharma.in@gmail.com>, Saurabh7 <saurabh.mahindre@gmail.com>

 OXPHOS	wiking: kk so i'll serialize MockObject
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	no
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lets serialize a real SGObject
@wiking	:)
@wiking	can we?
@wiking	i mean i dont care whether we do it with tags
@wiking	or the old parameter framework
 OXPHOS	wiking: the real ones are usually inherited several times. im not sure whether this will cause trouble debugging
@wiking	what do you mean?
@wiking	real ones?
@wiking	i mean the thign is
@wiking	whatever parameter an object has
@wiking	it has to register it via
@wiking	SG_ADD
@wiking	right?
@wiking	so you'll have a reference to that param
 OXPHOS	i thought SG_ADD can be replaced by register_param. no?
 OXPHOS	CKMeans is a candidate. I have tried this one.
 OXPHOS	wiking ^
@wiking	i mean either we do it with SG_ADD or register_parm
@wiking	doesn't matter
@wiking	the concept is the same
@wiking	you dont need to write the serialization fucntion
@wiking	of a given Object itself
@wiking	it should be implemented in a general way
@wiking	in SGObject
@wiking	see what i mean?
 OXPHOS	so, for SGObject (derived) instances, the params that need to be serialized are all in TParam/Param now right?
 OXPHOS	yes i think so
@wiking	yep
@wiking	or in case of Tags
@wiking	it's in the  map
 OXPHOS	it's self::map
@wiking	i mean in geneeral
 OXPHOS	yes
@wiking	you dont care
 OXPHOS	right
@wiking	about where it is stored
@wiking	that's the smaller part
@wiking	you need to write the function load/save
 OXPHOS	okay
@wiking	that will work for either case
@wiking	i mean since that PR is actually green
@wiking	and lisitsyn will soon merge it i hope
@wiking	you can do with the new tags
 OXPHOS	sure
@wiking	i'm fine, but yeah lets start rolling ideas
@wiking	in a PR
@wiking	how about i add a new feature branch?
@wiking	and you do a PR against that?
 OXPHOS	we had one
 OXPHOS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3226
 OXPHOS	feature/cereal
@wiking	ah cool
@wiking	wanna rebase that over the latest develop?
 OXPHOS	wiking sure! not sure whether there's gonna be conflicts because the feature branch has some CMakeList changes
 OXPHOS	wiking: actually many SGObject serialization needs the SGVector serialization methods. maybe you can check it?
 OXPHOS	wiking i mean the pr i just sent
 OXPHOS	pasted here
@wiking	what? :)
@wiking	i mean yeah i saw that one
@wiking	just rebase over the develop
@wiking	and see wtf
 OXPHOS	i thought u'r rebasing feature/cereal branch over develop..u want me to do it on my branch?
@wiking	ah just a sec
@wiking	lemme hack that one
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: OXPHOS :feature/cereal * 9cc25e9 / CMakeLists.txt,cmake/FindCereal.cmake,cmake/external/Cereal.cmake: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/9cc25e94b278278b5f278a6451f1937269672f14
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: squash
@wiking	rebased force pushed
@wiking	as you can se
@wiking	e
 OXPHOS	wiking: so...i'll wait or i should rebase sth. now?
@wiking	nono i mean it's rebased now
@wiking	the only thing you need to do is that you rebase that PR
@wiking	over the latest feature/cereal
@wiking	and then the only remaining question here is lisitsyn !
@wiking	meaning whether you wanna do it with Tparam
@wiking	or tags
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i mean for me either is fine
@wiking	that's shoudl be the least amount of time
@wiking	to change to this or that
@wiking	anyhow lets start doing it over SGObject
 OXPHOS	wiking: kk lemme rebase the pr first.
 OXPHOS	wiking: yeah the problems should be with map/tags itself not cereal
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	lets see where are the others

@wiking	iota is only c++11
@wiking	does your compiler support c++11? :)
@wiking	but then again

@wiking	i reckon i fixed something like this once already
 OXPHOS	wiking: it's guarded by #ifdef HAVE_CXX11. but anyway i muted that test for now as it's irrelevant.

 Saurabh7	hey wiking there ?
 Saurabh7	wiking: we could use https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FALCONN for primarily KNN ?
@wiking	Saurabh7: hello
@wiking	Saurabh7: sure we could
@wiking	i mean i'm just saying that if there's not much on your plate
@wiking	there's that :)
 Saurabh7	yes could do it, right now KNN uses langford cover tree impl, kdtree could be also used
 Saurabh7	wiking: ok will work on that next side by side
 Saurabh7	wiking: what to do you think about this multicore liblinear
 Saurabh7	the differences
@wiking	you mean in the weight vector
@wiking	i mean 10e-3 is not a minor error :P
 lisitsyn	WZZ
 Saurabh7	wiking: if I use their rng I think I could get same values
@wiking	Saurabh7: can you doublecheck?
@wiking	woudl it be too much of a hassle?
 Saurabh7	but then again their rng is set for whole test
@wiking	lisitsyn: sooooo we merge?
 lisitsyn	tags?
 Saurabh7	not in the testtcase
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes
@wiking	Saurabh7: i mean if it's 100% that it's coming from prng
@wiking	we really should not care
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: i mean it's all green
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah let me glance over it once again
 Saurabh7	wiking: lemme check with their rng again
 lisitsyn	then merge
 lisitsyn	wiking: can you do the same?
 lisitsyn	bullshit proof
@wiking	lisitsyn: lemme check
@wiking	Saurabh7: thnx
@wiking	lisitsyn: those are my 2 cents only
@wiking	other than that let it rock
 lisitsyn	wiking: hmm yeah lets fallback to map
 lisitsyn	in case of it is not available
 lisitsyn	I will commit a fix
@wiking	k
 OXPHOS	wiking lisitsyn: the travis is working on sth. else? it's not processing the check
 OXPHOS	never mind it's back to work
@wiking	OXPHOS: yeah travis is FIFO :)
@wiking	so sometimes need to wait quite a while
 Saurabh7	wiking: I get same values upto 10e-5 with their rng
@wiking	i see
@wiking	wonder where are the other diffs coming form
@wiking	*from
@wiking	but anyhow
@wiking	i would merge it
 Saurabh7	actually no i do %0.8f
 Saurabh7	its same upto 8
@wiking	aaha cool
 Saurabh7	so its rng then for sure
@wiking	then fuck it
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lets merge it
@wiking	where's the pr
@wiking	gimme link
 Saurabh7	nono not yet :)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	ok anyhow
 Saurabh7	how to guard non omp
@wiking	once it's in shape
 Saurabh7	complier
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn :feature/tags * 1de16fe / src/shogun/base/SGObject.cpp: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/1de16fe23aef5ffc800b9ed5e24bd9adcc6f7d8e
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Define SGObject::Self as class just like declared
 Saurabh7	because we use omp.h here
@wiking	ah
 Saurabh7	ok ill fix that
@wiking	there's a HAVE_OPENMP
@wiking	i think
@wiking	if not it's easy to make
@wiking	since we do openmp detection in cmake
@wiking	#ifdef HAVE_OPENMP
@wiking	there you go
@wiking	:)
@wiking	src/shogun/lib/config.h.in:#cmakedefine HAVE_OPENMP 1
 Saurabh7	ok cool
@wiking	so you can do ifdef else
 Saurabh7	and set num_thread of watever is used to 1 if not found
 Saurabh7	or*
@wiking	yep
@wiking	although
@wiking	you can keep that default
@wiking	because that's a global value
@wiking	and you dont wanna mess with other parts of the library or?
@wiking	(see the native posix implemenations somewhere)
@wiking	i mean it thread count there will not effect anything in this part of the code
@wiking	since omp will not be there
 Saurabh7	no i mean things like  omp_get_thread_num
 Saurabh7	are used here
 Saurabh7	I wont mess with parallel->num_threads
 Saurabh7	jsut do it for omp.h stuff
@wiking	ah
@wiking	just put a #ifdef HAVE_OPENMP around it
