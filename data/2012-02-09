 wiking	mm those are 2011 ideas that have not been implemented?

 wiking	why is that that when i create a kernel with the constructor with the left and right hand features shogun runs parallel, i.e. all 4 of my cores are used by shogun, while if i create the kernel with the default constructor and after that i call init function with the left and right-hand features, shogun runs only on one cpu
 wiking	talking here about multiclasssvm train/classification

 wiking	blackburn: heeey
 wiking	blackburn: got another question... it's more about the internals of shogun...
 wiking	blackburn: why is that that when i create a kernel with the constructor with the left and right hand features shogun runs parallel, i.e. all 4 of my cores are used by shogun, while if i create the kernel with the default constructor and after that i call init function with the left and right-hand features, shogun runs only on one cpu
 n4nd0	hi there
 n4nd0	yesterday I installed shogun with support for the matlab static interface
 n4nd0	but I get some troubles trying out some of the examples
 n4nd0	do I have to install matlab_modular or any other for them to work or is it another problem?
 n4nd0	has someone installed before cplex in ubuntu?

 blackburn	wiking: no idea, will have to check later
 wiking	mmm
 blackburn	wiking: but you can use kernel.parallel.set_num_threads(4)
 wiking	tried
 wiking	no help
 blackburn	to set it explicitly
 wiking	it seems there's something else
 wiking	because during training time it's always sequential, i.e. never use threads
 wiking	but for some reason in case of histogramintersectionkernel there's a different speed depending on which constructor i'm using
 wiking	although i know it doesn't make much sense, but this is what i get :S
 blackburn	what exactly do you do?
 blackburn	funny I use HIK too now :)
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	well i'm trying to test my features with different kernels
 wiking	so my usual thing is to create a kernel and then do the init
 wiking	i mean do it later the init, after i've created the right kernel
 wiking	and so with HIK it's weird
 wiking	with poly kernel it's fine for instance
 blackburn	well there is no difference between ^ and ^
 blackburn	I mean CKernel class is parallelized
 blackburn	not particular ones
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i've checked the c++ code
 wiking	so it's really weird
 wiking	but now it's not even that
 wiking	because as far as i can see now
 wiking	the training time is never parallel
 wiking	so it's always running on one cpu
 wiking	but somehow when i use one or the other way of constructing the HIK kernel
 wiking	the training time is very different
 wiking	so let's say one way is like 10-20 seconds
 wiking	the other way it's at least 2-3 minutes
 blackburn	could u please paste the code somewhere?
 wiking	ok sure
 wiking	letme pastebin it
 wiking	but note that i'm using java api
 blackburn	well should not make any difference
 blackburn	but who knows :D
 wiking	ok
 wiking	here's the snippet of the code: http://pastebin.com/2pGUjKw4
 wiking	and depending on line 35 boolean you'll get slow or 'norma'/fast training time
 blackburn	hmm I see
 blackburn	the same cache size!
 blackburn	strange it could act in a different way
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	so i've tried to set everything the same
 wiking	just the way i construct the kernel is different
 wiking	i've checked the cpp code
 wiking	i cannot see the difference
 blackburn	me neither
 wiking	so now the only thing is somewhere in the java modular stuff
 wiking	something happens
 wiking	i've tried to turn on debugging mode
 blackburn	no, can't be true
 wiking	but i couldn't get there
 wiking	for some reason the inheritance thingy is not working in java
 wiking	i.e. i cannot call kernel.parallel.get_num_cpus ()
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	bad,bad
 wiking	i have to do first a kernel.get_global_parallel
 wiking	and then do the thingy there
 blackburn	do you think it is parallel issue?
 wiking	nah not really
 wiking	as said
 wiking	i've tried to monitor the number of threads
 wiking	it's always 4, i.e. as many core i have
 wiking	and in train time i never get more than 1 threads running
 blackburn	LaRank is not parallelized so it is ok
 wiking	so it's not really the parallelization problem
 wiking	it's more like, why does it run slower
 blackburn	in fact we have no svm with parallel training
 blackburn	that's really strange
 blackburn	sorry I have to go now, but I'll check a little bit later
 wiking	i think some flag is not turned on in some if branch
 wiking	but i'll try to do first the same thing with a silly
 wiking	c++ code
 wiking	if i can get the same thing
 wiking	ok no worries thnx!
 blackburn	are you subscribed to the mailing list?
 blackburn	I would suggest you to create github issue or write to the mailing list
 blackburn	if you want
 wiking	ah ok i'll do the github issue then
 blackburn	thanks
 wiking	nw
 blackburn	it would be easier then to take care :)

 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the problem with matlab?
 n4nd0	blackburn, so there were a couple of issues
 n4nd0	blackburn, the one that I was concerned about was that the lpboost example does not run
 n4nd0	blackburn, it says sth like classifier LPBOOST not found
 blackburn	n4nd0: matlab static?
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have looked it up on google and it seems that cplex is required for it to work so I am with that right now
 n4nd0	blackburn, yes, I am using matlab static this far
 blackburn	ah yes
 n4nd0	blackburn, should it be an issue static or modular just to try the example out?
 n4nd0	blackburn, I found that example under matlab_static so I assumed that it should work there also
 n4nd0	there too*
 blackburn	well should work indeed
 blackburn	but cplex is required I guess
 blackburn	lemme check
 n4nd0	let's see then if I managed to get cplex to work
 n4nd0	yeah I found that in this forum
 blackburn	you could check it by yourself too :) just take a look on classifier/LPBoost.h
 blackburn	there is a #ifdef HAVE_CPLEX
 blackburn	so just install cplex and ./configure, etc
 n4nd0	didn't think of looking it up in the code :-O
 n4nd0	the other problem I found is that all the data directories are empty
 n4nd0	I made first a defauult installation: ./configure, make, make install
 n4nd0	and later another one with ./configure interfaces=matlab_static
 n4nd0	but those directories are empty in any case
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	do
 blackburn	git submodule update --init
 blackburn	IIRC
 blackburn	or git submodule --init update
 blackburn	that's a typical problem for sure
 blackburn	it is because shogun and shogun-data are two different repos
 n4nd0	mmm I installed it from the compressed directory so I must first activate the repo
 blackburn	uh oh
 blackburn	then I would suggest you to git clone shogun :)
 blackburn	no idea how to activate it from compressed one
 n4nd0	all right
 n4nd0	I will take a look to that once I am done with the cplex issue
 n4nd0	thank you very much :D
 blackburn	you're welcome :)
 blackburn	wiking: did you get any progress with this strange issue? :)
 wiking	blackburn: none yet... postponed it... now i'm using the lil hack which is faster... since i would really like to get to the point where i can try out MKL on multi class :) that was the main reason i've started to write my shogun wrapper in my code... ;)
 blackburn	wiking: okay sure
 wiking	aaha coool
 wiking	i've just realized that i can iterate through the features i've appended to the CombinedFeatures
 blackburn	I feel butthurt remembering that there was a leak in java interface :D
 blackburn	it was reproduced with HUGE mkl script
 wiking	uff
 blackburn	okay heading to bed right now
 blackburn	see you
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	let's see what happens
 wiking	i really wouldn't like to rewrite now the whole thing in python or c++ :>
 wiking	anyhow gnite
 blackburn	nooo
 blackburn	bug is not here anymore
 blackburn	I hope
 blackburn	it was CustomKernel issue
 blackburn	but consider using python anyway, it is much cooler for shoguning :)
 wiking	hahahahah
 wiking	i'm using mahout as well
 wiking	so i need a common ground :>
 blackburn	I've never used it
 wiking	it's cool
 blackburn	ah yeah makes sense
 wiking	but it's mainly developed for text processing
 blackburn	is it for distributed things?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	based on hadoop
 wiking	but for me that's just for acquiring the features
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	so it's good otherwise with shogun
 blackburn	but they don't have many svms :D
 wiking	until now i was using weka :>
 wiking	but it's kind of like sucks as well with their limited kernels...
 blackburn	what do you mean saying limited?
 wiking	well like i really wanted HIK
 wiking	and now i really hope i'm getting some boost with MKL
 blackburn	with which features do you use HIK?
 wiking	ah i'm doing image classification
 blackburn	color histograms?
 wiking	sift histogram
 wiking	so basically bag of visual words...
 blackburn	I used to do similar thing
 wiking	ah and what's now? :)
 blackburn	actually I'm going to implement some IKSVM a little bit later
 wiking	mmm paper?
 blackburn	http://acberg.com/papers/mbm08cvpr.pdf
 blackburn	this one
 wiking	ash a cvpr one :)
 wiking	cool i'll give it a read
 wiking	btw
 wiking	any plan for latent svm
 wiking	?
 blackburn	not really, I don't know much about latent svms yet
 blackburn	I used to implement dim reduction things so I'm pretty new to svms still hah
 blackburn	okay now going to sleep really :)
 blackburn	see you later
 wiking	laterz
 blackburn	we should exchange experience later :)
