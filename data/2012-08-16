@sonney2k	no
 gsomix	good book about 3 generations of programmers: MIT (1950-1960), hardware engineers, game developers and... Stallman.

@sonney2k	gsomix_, so you make the zero copy optional right?
@sonney2k	because one still has to use frombuffer() ?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, yep. I did not figure out, how overload constructor, so there is frombuffer method.
 CIA-21	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r63c8091 / (data doc/tutorial): require current data / doc - http://git.io/UYfhIg
 gsomix_	sonney2k, btw, maybe do you know, how raise exceptions in python c/api?
@sonney2k	gsomix_, IIRC you have to return some empty python object (and incref it ... IIRC PyNone or so?)
@sonney2k	and set the error message
@sonney2k	gsomix_, the static python interface should have that code
 gsomix_	thanks
@sonney2k	gsomix_, instead of frombuffer you could just modify the typemaps
 shogun-buildbot_	build #348 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/348
@sonney2k	gsomix_, or is this even possible? I mean do you need access to the underlying SGObject?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, no, I don't.
 wiking	meeting :D
 gsomix_	>> you could just modify the typemaps || and constructor. I want something like in numpy - DenseFeatures(array, copy=True/False).
 shogun-buildbot_	build #287 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test cmdline_static]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/287  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	gsomix_, yeah that would be cool ...
 blackburn	wtf
 blackburn	I fixeed that
 blackburn	ahhhh
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea - looks like recent commits broke even the standard git submodule update process

 wiking	ok warnning fix: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/720
 CIA-21	shogun: Viktor Gal master * r1f29074 / src/shogun/machine/LinearLatentMachine.cpp : Remove apply() implementation from LinearLatentMachine - http://git.io/vxi0jw

 blackburn	:D
-!- vojtech [9320543b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.147.32.84.59] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	uricamic: vojtech: is it possible to extend ocas or/and bmrm to use mixed norms like L1/Lq?
 vojtech	blackburn: it would not be easy.
 blackburn	in both cases?
 vojtech	both translate the original hard problem to a simpler reduced problem which is QP task in the case of L2 norm
 vojtech	if you would use L1 norm it would lead to LP
 CIA-21	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ree71cb3 / examples/undocumented/libshogun/test.cpp : Removed test example introduced by mistake - http://git.io/ZlpnDA
 blackburn	I see
 vojtech	it would not be stable
 vojtech	it would require additional stabilization term
 vojtech	not easy
 wiking	heiko: yo
 blackburn	I thought of two applications - multitask and group lasso-like thing
 blackburn	that's why I asked
 heiko	wiking hi
 wiking	heiko: how's the mocking going?
 blackburn	vojtech: what is use case of bmrm with proximal term?
 heiko	wiking, the gmock installation is still not working, but I worked on something else the last days (cross-validation output stuff and labels)
 heiko	Do you have a linux system where you can run the tests?
 vojtech	blackburn, for example structured output SVM
 wiking	heiko: cool, u mean you are having problem with the configure script?
 wiking	heiko: yes indeed.. then i'll try to fix it for you
 wiking	heiko: i've already installed gmock there from .deb
 heiko	that would be great
 heiko	which version?
 wiking	so i see the problem with ./configure
 blackburn	vojtech: I mean, what can we do with that w_t term in objective?
 heiko	since the current one in debian/ubuntu doesnt have a config script
 heiko	to get the paths
 wiking	heiko: yeah neither this one... i mean i'm using latest LTS of ubuntu
 heiko	I added the possibility to add a custom one to shogus confgure script
 wiking	afaik htat's the latest ubuntu release ;P
 heiko	but still I have problems
 wiking	heiko: i see that
 heiko	same here, latest ubuntu
 wiking	heiko: i'll try to steal from somewhere the configure script for gmock ;P
 wiking	heiko: i guess checkheader check lib will work as well
 vojtech	blackburn, the proxy term is introduce to avoid zig-zag behaviour at early stages of convergence. I don't know what you can do with it ...
 heiko	wiking, ok
 vojtech	blackburn, may be I didn't understand the question
 blackburn	vojtech: so it is just a helper thing?
 vojtech	yes, to speedup convergence
 blackburn	vojtech: well there are some domain adaptation formulations that pull w to some w_t
 vojtech	I know
 wiking	heiko: a bit scary stuff though.... is that for some reason the gmock package does not have gtest bundled into the package
 wiking	heiko: so i'll have to add a gtest test as well
 blackburn	vojtech:  is that possible with that proximal term?
 vojtech	blackburn, the implemented method is generic, i.e. you can add any convex term, e.g. additional proxy trerm
 blackburn	vojtech: I see, thanks
 heiko	wiking, ok , strange
 heiko	wiking, I got loads of tests ready, so looking forward to this working :)
 wiking	heiko: aaaah ok it does ...
 wiking	heiko: it's just a dep package: Depends: libgtest-dev
 heiko	I got that installed

@sonney2k	hmmhh what happened to the NY folks?
@sonney2k	blackburn, is chris away?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't know
 blackburn	who are NY folks?
@sonney2k	who else is missing - n4nd0 (who said that he cannot make it)
 blackburn	I know only one
@sonney2k	blackburn, chris, puffin
 blackburn	puffin is pretty far away from NY :)
@sonney2k	timezone wise - same
 blackburn	you mean timezone wise
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	pluskid also cannot make it
@sonney2k	so I guess we can start then
@sonney2k	Alright everyone - welcome to our final celebration.
@sonney2k	Last weeks lots of PRs have been merged and I am very happy to see how much you have contributed (and hopefully will be contributing in the future).
@sonney2k	Now please everyone help getting shogun stable such that we can release version 2.0 with your code merged! So focus now is bugfixes (get the warnings down to ZERO), tests, documentation, tutorial.
@sonney2k	That said - only heiko sent me some figures for the new website. Excuses anyone?
 heiko	>:o
@sonney2k	look heiko even shows his angry face
@sonney2k	uricamic, wiking, blackburn  c'mon!
-!- pluskid [72f6b3c3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.114.246.179.195] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	pluskid, and you too :D
 wiking	pluskid: you should hide! :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ich spreche englisch nicht
 wiking	pluskid: sonney2k is angry :>
@sonney2k	welcome
@sonney2k	wiking, no heiko is
 pluskid	wow, so few people?
* heiko raging
 cheng	pluskid: Hi, was worried that I had to actually do some work. ;-)
 pluskid	cheng: haha :p
 gsomix_	>:3
@sonney2k	so pluskid, uricamic, wiking, blackburn  - please send pictures created with the aid of shogun *TODAY*
 pluskid	sonney2k: sorry for absent during the last several days, but what kind of pictures do you need?
 wiking	:>
@sonney2k	gsomix_ is somehow an exception - protocol buffers are not really hmmh screenshots
 blackburn	das fasse ich nicht
 heiko	pluskid, just something that shows how your methods work
@sonney2k	pluskid, some nice ones for the website
 heiko	(which is easy for GP)
 vojtech	sonney2k, could you remind us what kind of pictures. E.g. what picture should be send for a generic SVM solver ?
 pluskid	sonney2k, heiko OK
 heiko	you can do all these cool heatmap plot with posterior probabilities
 cheng	pluskid: Once you get the sign dataset working, I guess there will be nice pictures.
 pluskid	cheng: that is impossible for the *TODAY* deadline
@sonney2k	vojtech, well some illustrative application - something where you can show what a method does / how it does it in a figure
@sonney2k	something *fancy*
@sonney2k	I don't mind if you don't do it today but create a more fancy one a little later
@sonney2k	if you tell me when I get it
 pluskid	sonney2k: are there any examples?
 blackburn	cheng: pluskid: ah right sorry I forgot to prepare it
 cheng	pluskid: I know. Didn't mean to pressure you.
 pluskid	:)
@sonney2k	cheng, that is my job anyways ;)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #359 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/359  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	vojtech, e.g. for dimension reduction methods some embedding. for svm the usual figure good / vs bad with kernels (we have that already btw)
 heiko	doorbell ..
 blackburn	cowbell ..
@sonney2k	usually that is some small python script so you can aswell look for examples in examples/undocumented/<if>/graphical
@sonney2k	and add yours there
 vojtech	sonney2k, ok we will create something
@sonney2k	and then just save the figure
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	anyone still has questions to that?
@sonney2k	...
@sonney2k	if not...
@sonney2k	lets continue
@sonney2k	Now for some formal stuff: According to the timeline https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2012 there are two upcoming todo items:
@sonney2k	1. Mentors/Students - please submit your final evaluations by August 23rd latest (24th is the hard deadline from google).
@sonney2k	2. Students submit your code samples to google (blackburn will send around a script on the mailinglist to do this) after August 31.
@sonney2k	so 1) is very important not to miss for mentors/students
@sonney2k	otherwise no money for the student
 heiko	one more thing about the plots: please use the latex integration script in the graphical folder in python_modular, it ensures that all plots integrate well with the tutorial
@sonney2k	so students push you mentors!
@sonney2k	it will be the same effort as last time btw
@sonney2k	heiko, well I just need .png's or /jpgs for now - I think we can do the rest for the tutorial later
 gsomix_	sonney2k, *push*
 heiko	sonney2k, I know, still, its just one line import
@sonney2k	gsomix_, no worries
 heiko	Then they all have same fonts etc
@sonney2k	that reminds me, heiko, pluskid, blackburn have been writing some nice tutorial / documentation for their parts
@sonney2k	you can find the latex source under shogun/doc/tutorial
 cheng	like +1
@sonney2k	please in the final weeks contribute to that tutorial
 pluskid	its in submodular btw
 pluskid	module?
@sonney2k	vojtech, uricamic - you could probably just copy formulas description over from your .tex source of your papers
 uricamic	ok
@sonney2k	nicococo, and you too
 nicococo	si claro
 gsomix_	btw, if somebody wants to check shogun on python3 - welcome. :)
@sonney2k	gsomix_, I did only once but weeks ago - it worked nicely - maybe we need a buildbot test...
@sonney2k	students: regarding 2) this is an easy task with the script blackburn will send around - so don't worry too much about it
 blackburn	67 warnings left
@sonney2k	please help us getting these 67 -> 0
 uricamic	I have few warnings still there, I am waiting for the wiking PR to merge and I will fix them
 blackburn	uricamic: are you ok to merge it?
@sonney2k	as a reminder: that's the url where you can see the status http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
 uricamic	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	okay that's what I was waiting for
 CIA-21	shogun: Viktor Gal master * ra72e3cf / (25 files in 4 dirs):
 CIA-21	shogun: Refactor RiskFunction in structure methods This code refactoring basically adds
 CIA-21	shogun: RiskFunction functionality into StructuredModel. This way we can remove
 CIA-21	shogun: RiskFunction and all the related objects and have only one user defined class
 CIA-21	shogun: (StructuredModel) for SO methods. - http://git.io/9bPKaA
 CIA-21	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r3ce4fd2 / (25 files in 4 dirs): Merge pull request #719 from vigsterkr/so - http://git.io/KheEig
 uricamic	I see, I didn't know that :)
 uricamic	ok, thx
 blackburn	yeah I kept it in secret
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	(forgot to ask)
 uricamic	:D
@sonney2k	so
@sonney2k	Now please everyone tell us what you liked about doing shogun - GSoC, what you did hate. Any kind of honest criticism / feedback is very welcome such that we can learn what we should improve. I very much prefer unfiltered direct feedback (like fuck of Soeren!!!) in contrast to not letting us know you did hate us :D
 wiking	wooohoooo BIGPATCH :)
@sonney2k	who wants to start?
@sonney2k	pluskid/cheng?
 cheng	pluskid?
 pluskid	sonney2k: so this time complain instead of weekly summary?
@sonney2k	pluskid, is this a complaint?
@sonney2k	:)
 pluskid	:D
@sonney2k	please complain :D
 pluskid	I would say great org!
 pluskid	but shall I complain about SG_REF/SG_UNREF?
@sonney2k	(I don't mind others joining pluskids complaints)
 blackburn	sonney2k: tarball generator is in the mailing list
 pluskid	I always forget about when should a SG_REF be put :p
@sonney2k	pluskid, sure complain about what you hate
@sonney2k	pluskid, that is why we need you post-gsoc
@sonney2k	otherwise this mechanism will stay until the nd of days
@sonney2k	*end
 pluskid	oh, I'm starting to regret for saying that :>>>
 cheng	pluskid: Is there stuff from an organisation viewpoint of GSoC that we could make better?
 blackburn	pluskid: we know you are going to do some research so please take a little effort if required to use shogun
 blackburn	it is worth the thing I am sure
@sonney2k	at least it paid off here
 pluskid	I guess sending some small gifts to the students will be nice, like bages or T-shirts with SHOGUN on it
 pluskid	blackburn, sonney2k: sure~~
 blackburn	shogun get me paid with a lot of useful contacts and skills one can miss when developing they own solution
@sonney2k	pluskid, we need some shogun design for the t-shirt ...
 pluskid	btw, I saw someone comparing their algorithm with the MKL in shogun at KDD
@sonney2k	pluskid, yeah shogun is known for MKL :(
@sonney2k	or :)
 pluskid	sonney2k: why :( ? :D
 blackburn	I'd like to have a t-shirt with https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/sonne.jpg
@sonney2k	pluskid, any other feedback?
 pluskid	btw, I'm finished with my complain
@sonney2k	vojtech, uricamic - mind to continue?
@sonney2k	blackburn, then print it yourself
 blackburn	sonney2k: no I believe it should be official
@sonney2k	blackburn, but I usually don't wear pants o_O
 blackburn	sonney2k: only t-shirt?
 gsomix_	blackburn, \m/
 blackburn	bad boy
 vojtech	sonney2k, Michal should say what he likes/dislikes as he did the work. I was just a scientific support :)
@sonney2k	vojtech, well you can complain too :D
@sonney2k	wiking / alexlovesdata you too please start to complain
 uricamic	well, I quite enjoyed GSoC, so I don't have much complains
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/pics.png is that a nice pic? :D
 uricamic	maybe just our little misunderstanding that resulted in little divergence in so framework :)
@sonney2k	uricamic, I hope that this is resolved by now :)
 vojtech	sonney2k, This year everything went quite smoothly. w.r.t organization I new it from the previous year and w.r.t coding Michal works independently = minimal load for me :)
 uricamic	there is only one thing left I need to discuss with n4ndo
 blackburn	vojtech: sonney2k removed your last gsoc project in the middle of summer :D
@sonney2k	we never had such strong interdependence like in wikings/n4nd0s/uricamics task
 blackburn	thanks to me :D I restored it with stl vector instead
@sonney2k	but it is back now
 uricamic	he made some change in the last PR that results in shogun exception when BMRM used for trainig
 wiking	all's great but why cannot we use STD! :D
 uricamic	but I guess, it will be easy to fix that too
 wiking	especially STL :D
 vojtech	blackburn: which project ? The EM algorithm from the last year ?
 blackburn	vojtech: yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, you sound a bit like pluskid - anyway some exceptions are OK but only in .cpp files (though I still don't like it)
 vojtech	very good, I know people who use it in their work ...
 wiking	sonney2k: nah it was just a joke... i mean we can live w/o it
@sonney2k	nicococo, heiko, blackburn anything you want to complain about?
 wiking	got used to SGVector and SGMatrix
 nicococo	n4nd0 is not here i can't complain for him. for me it was pure joy ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am so integrated to shogun - I can complain only about myself I guess
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	not here, I wanted the unit-tests, which we now have. Apart from that, everything fine! :) pretty much enjoyed it
@sonney2k	blackburn, shall I complain about you then?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah feel free :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you always break the build :D
@sonney2k	is that a hobby?
 blackburn	no I don't, I always repair the build
 wiking	heiko: dont lie you dont have it! :D
 wiking	heiko: but will soon ;P
 heiko	wiking, I HOPE SO!!!! :D
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	as a complaint maybe
 wiking	a serious one
 wiking	why we no switch to cmake completely?
@sonney2k	OK so does anyone have an opinion in which direction shogun should be developed in the future?
 uricamic	wiking: yep I would appreciate that too :)
 wiking	cmake it :)
 uricamic	+1 :)
@sonney2k	wiking, that sounds like a longer discussion we should rather do offline
 wiking	hehe ok i'm just saying that now with all the ./configure script hacks i had lately
 wiking	i know that half of them are not portable
 cheng	How about making sure that shogun goes into the standard distributions?
 wiking	i.e. woulnd't work on some arch/distrib combination
@sonney2k	wiking, huge effort in any case
 wiking	but yeah i know that it does take some time
 wiking	btw: another good thing would be if some GUI guy would come around
 cheng	I mean updating the other repositories with more recent versions.
 wiking	and make a nice gui for shogun :)
 blackburn	gui? why?
 heiko	wiking, gui?
@sonney2k	cheng, yeah I tried to do shogun packages for debian/ ubuntu but badly maintained them (due to other errors in clang on powerpc / python packaging stuff)...
 wiking	yep
 heiko	pretty much work, huge
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	gui?
 heiko	and also, why
 blackburn	no idea how gui looks like :D
@sonney2k	Isn't python the guy gui?
 wiking	why not? :) i mean i know so many people who wouldn't touch anything that's command line (and they all hack weka because of that)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #360 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/360  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	yeeey i broke it!
 blackburn	no
@sonney2k	it was all broken anywyas
 blackburn	it was
 wiking	ah ok it wasn't me
 wiking	:)
 cheng	How about instead of a gui, a html interface?
@sonney2k	but no one fixed it...
 wiking	cheng: that's gui as well :)
 blackburn	I know the cause
 wiking	cheng: i mean yeah a nice html fronted would be great as well
 gsomix_	only command line, only hardcore :)
 cheng	sonney2k: for many people, installing from source sounds too scary.
 heiko	sonney2k, yes, I double that
 blackburn	from my experience shogun is not enough and you do a cross-library thing
 blackburn	no idea how to gui that
 heiko	I know quite a feq scientists who never compiled anything, so it would be great to have at least debian/ubuntu biulds for shogun
 blackburn	yeah auto .deb
@sonney2k	django / shogun ... possible but danger is that we get lots of newbie users
@sonney2k	heiko, blackburn, cheng pre-built stuff is on the todo then
@sonney2k	anyone has some new ML domains / algorithms in mind?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh we need to emphasize that static is not recommended unless you know what you do
 cheng	wiking: I suggest html instead of gui because building cross platform windows is tough.
 blackburn	cheng: we do not support windows natively anyway
 cheng	sonney2k: deep networks
 wiking	cheng: second that
@sonney2k	cheng, find us some mentor ...
 blackburn	lecun
@sonney2k	cheng, ask Yann at NIPS :D
 blackburn	:D
 cheng	blackburn: I mean like OSX (sorry, overloaded the word windows(
 cheng	blackburn: Qt and Tk are tricky on osx.
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	and I do not want to develop gui
 blackburn	:D
-!- gsomix_ is now known as gsomix
 blackburn	cheng: sonney2k: I agree we have to have deep learning here
@sonney2k	but seriously, cheng, nicococo, vojtech ask at ML conferences if you find sth interesting if these authors wouldn't mind to mentor next year
 blackburn	however it is a kind of magic
@sonney2k	none of us here has any clue about deep learning
@sonney2k	(except from literature)
 wiking	:)
 wiking	use Theano
 nicococo	i can ask gregoire montavon (sitting next to me) he is well known for his deep networks...
 cheng	sonney2k: I will do some salesman stuff.
 wiking	pretty heavy weight shit :)
@sonney2k	so we need an expert
@sonney2k	otherwise better not touch this field
 blackburn	we wanted to implement LMNN
 blackburn	no idea if it is hot still
@sonney2k	cheng, well there is yann's lush, torch5 or 7 , theano ...
@sonney2k	I would rather steal code than doing everything from scratch though
 cheng	The other popular area is sparse learning, compressed sensing.
@sonney2k	*borrow!
 blackburn	yeah compressed sensing is really hot
 cheng	I just saw David Donoho being a superhero at an MRI conference.
 blackburn	i should contact igor carron and ask about mentoring something
@sonney2k	ok if you still have ideas bring them on any time but lets continue for now
@sonney2k	Students/Mentors as usual please give us an update - what is left to do / or do you still intend to do before the planned shogun release (September 1) and maybe later. Did you manage to implement everything you put on your schedule / are you satisfied with the work you did or what do you want to improve?
 cheng	Quite amazing for a mathematician to be an invited speaker  at an application conference.
@sonney2k	pluskid, you wanted to start with that I remember :D
 pluskid	ok
 pluskid	before the end of GSoC
 pluskid	I was mainly cleanning up the code, and writing the tutor
 pluskid	I wish to complete the multiclass part of the tutor
@sonney2k	pluskid, I know you want to do SG_REF/UNREF in the future (you all are witnesses)
 pluskid	sonney2k: hope I have time for that
 pluskid	:D
@sonney2k	vojtech, cheng, btw can you contribute some latex for the tutorial? you also have written quite a bit of papers that could fill a few sections...
 cheng	sonney2k: Sure
@sonney2k	pluskid, us too.
@sonney2k	gsomix, mind to continue?
 blackburn	pluskid: cheng: let us discuss road sign data just after meeting?
 vojtech	sonney2k, yes we can write it
 pluskid	blackburn: ok!
 cheng	blackburn: great
 gsomix	sonney2k, mmm?
 gsomix	I lost the thread of the discussion :(
 wiking	gsomix: complain :)))
 blackburn	gsomix: what is left to do?
 blackburn	what do you want to do and what you are happy and unhappy with?
 gsomix	ah
@sonney2k	gsomix, you can also say what you did if you want :)
@sonney2k	wiking, alexlovesdata - maybe you next then?
 gsomix	I just want to finish protocols/directors/typemaps for needed classes. And I'm happy with it.
 alexlovesdata	wiking?
@sonney2k	gsomix, to the point as usual :)
 wiking	sonney2k: i have complained already :D
 wiking	sonney2k: and gave suggestion about what woudl be gread in long run for shogun
@sonney2k	wiking, yes but what is left todo?
 wiking	sonney2k: ah ok
@sonney2k	what will you do before release?
 wiking	sonney2k: left to do: give you nice pictures, add a part into tutorial and now after the last 2 PRs of yesterday merge latentmodel with structuredmodel resulting in latent so svm
 wiking	they'll be done in reverse order :)
@sonney2k	some nice examples that create figures would be optimal
 wiking	yeps
@sonney2k	vojtech, uricamic - please continue
 wiking	maybe i push then tutorial the last task
 alexlovesdata	ye,we had also an idea like that
 alexlovesdata	to create an example that yields some pics of detection finds
 uricamic	ok, todo: produce examples that creates some pictures
 uricamic	+ contribute to the turorial
@sonney2k	uricamic, code is ready otherwise right?
@sonney2k	uricamic, btw didn't you want to do some benchmark / comparison?
 uricamic	the learning algorithms are ok
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	uricamic: we need to fix multiclass
 blackburn	it is not being initialized when using risk
 wiking	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	wiking: python example fails
 wiking	aah
 wiking	ok that might be my bad as well
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	it was there before
 uricamic	yep, I guess the problem is in the last PR from n4ndo, now when someone uses BMRM for training it then results in exception
 wiking	ah ok
@sonney2k	uricamic, ^
 blackburn	uricamic: in argmax number of classes is set
 blackburn	you don't call argmax so number of classes is not set
 vojtech	sonney2k, we plan to submit a paper about the method. This will require doing benchmarks.
 blackburn	that's the only reason
 uricamic	yep, but the current multiclass risk function does not use argmax at all
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn	uricamic: that needs to be handled somehow
@sonney2k	vojtech, would be nice to have this figure / comparison in the tutorial I think
 uricamic	I know, I wanted to discuss this with n4ndo, but haven't catch him yet
 vojtech	sonney2k, we have some comparison - figures - already. We will put it to the tutorial
 uricamic	also there have been some problem with MulticlassSOLabels that valgrind complained about
@sonney2k	heiko, maybe you continue?
@sonney2k	vojtech, ok
 heiko	yeah, ok
 heiko	I finished everything, that is all two-sample and independence tests
@sonney2k	uricamic, just fix this then or talk to us after the meeting :)
 heiko	recently did minor updates and optimisations
 uricamic	sonney2k: sure
 heiko	examples
* sonney2k worldmodel complete
 heiko	tutorial
 heiko	so my project is ready from what was is the proposal
 heiko	there are lots of things that I still like to integrate, but that will happen after shogun2.0
@sonney2k	heiko, so what would you want to do before (if you have time...)
 heiko	this week, I want to get grips with the unit tests
 heiko	I wrote a lot of them, they are currently in the examples
 heiko	also, currently I am working on a more sophisticated cross-validation intermediate result thing
 heiko	based on blackburns ModelSelectionOutput
-!- yoo [2eda6d52@gateway/web/freenode/ip.46.218.109.82] has joined #shogun
 heiko	(they guy from cambridge wanted this and I remember other poeple asking
 yoo	hi all
@sonney2k	ok
 heiko	I also integrated this john plat sigmoid fitting for the labels, that has to be integrated. and there is an extension for multiclass that I wrote and want to add to shogun
 heiko	apart from the bugfixing7warnings etc
 heiko	one thing:
@sonney2k	that is a lot already
@sonney2k	(if you intend to sleep)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #361 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/361  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 heiko	from next week, I will have to take a step back since my Master's thesis deadline is on 7th Sept
 heiko	so a few hours less per week for shogun
@sonney2k	I was wondering already...
 heiko	Its already in a pretty good state
 heiko	but writing things up takes time
@sonney2k	better focus on your thesis then
@sonney2k	we don't want you to fail with that!
 heiko	and yes, sleeping is important for me :D
 blackburn	I am wondering what should I do in my master thesis :D
 blackburn	I am totally lost in ML now
 cheng	blackburn: in computer science?
 heiko	blackburn, you can jsut ask people to host you
 blackburn	cheng: yeah I want to do ML but don't know what to do at all
 blackburn	host me?
 heiko	yes your thesis
 heiko	You can ask other people that at you uni
 blackburn	I am unsure I understand what do you mean
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	I guess blackburn you should take over
 blackburn	I am the biggest expert in ML here
 blackburn	:D
 shogun-buildbot_	build #288 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test cmdline_static]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/288  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 gsomix	sad, but true :(
@sonney2k	right after vladimir V.
 heiko	He's in London :)
 cheng	Hey, if you contribute to shogun, you are by definition an ML expert.
 blackburn	in my university rare professor know what SVM is
 blackburn	may be 3-4 of they do know
 heiko	blackburn, thats why I suggested to ask other people :)
 blackburn	heiko: other people where/
 heiko	e.g. London/Berlin
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	well that's something optional for they
 heiko	Then you got one supervisor locally and the other one somewhere else
 heiko	anyway, lets talk about that later :)
 blackburn	yeah ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you want to go to berlin, or anywhere it would probably not be a problem
@sonney2k	just choose the city / group...
@sonney2k	task etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not able to leave country yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, but please continue with what you have done
@sonney2k	err
@sonney2k	want to do :D
 blackburn	I will just be arrested and happily go to army lol
 cheng	ML for military. Very bad.
 blackburn	cheng: that's mandatory here but not when I am studying here
@sonney2k	seems like blackburn is shy today
 blackburn	sonney2k: shy?
 blackburn	why shy?
 blackburn	probably I interrupted the process :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, anything you want to do before shogun 2.0 / sth still on todo?
@sonney2k	what you want to improve in your (other) code?
 blackburn	yes, I am going to extend liblinear with MTL graph setting for regression problems
 blackburn	then I wanted to unify its API
 blackburn	and extend existing SLEP solver with overlapping group lasso
@sonney2k	vojtech, before I forget - labels in multiclass ocas are 0...<nr_classes-1> ?
 blackburn	may be some examples to do too
@sonney2k	blackburn, pictures :D
 blackburn	I got no idea about pictures
 cheng	crazy idea: would shogun work on a phone or tablet?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well discuss with chris - you can probably show how a decision surface is changed when multi/dual task stuff is used
 blackburn	cheng: probably that's possible, but what to do with it?
@sonney2k	cheng, sure it runs on gunnars iphone for years
 cheng	you can go around classifying stuff with the phone camera.
@sonney2k	(we even tweaked configure for that)
 blackburn	oh well it is rather opencv example
 alexlovesdata	@cheng: cloudi nterface for shogun :P
-!- emrecelikten [~emre@trir-5d8007aa.pool.mediaWays.net] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	but actually I know how to implement that
 vojtech	sonney2k, labels in libocas: 1,2,3...nY
 wiking	cheng: it works with raspebrry pi
 wiking	cheng: *raspberry
 wiking	cheng: alas it should be possible to use it on iphone
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmh then I guess we need to label[i]+1 ...
 wiking	sonney2k: but that way i get really all the labels shifted :)
@sonney2k	ok then does anyone have any final comments / questions?
 cheng	I think it has been a great GSoC.
 wiking	sonney2k: the labels are shifted by +1
 cheng	Very lively group of students this year.
@sonney2k	heh
 pluskid	how time flies
@sonney2k	Finally, once GSoC is over real live will usually require much more time - so IRC might be less helpful than postings on the mailinglist. I think it would be nice if we authors would post using some official me@shogun-toolbox.org email address. So everyone here who intends to stick around should get this forward.
@sonney2k	So final words - thanks all for your great efforts. It has been fun (at least for me and I hope for you too). We hope you will stick around - please keep in touch in one way or another...
 blackburn	for ones who are interested in some careers it is useful for sure
 blackburn	I got contacted by google twice because of shogun :D
 cheng	Also, spread the word about shogun to your colleagues. We want more users and also more potential developers.
* pluskid is hesitating to update his resume
 pluskid	*hurrying
 wiking	blackburn: :>
@sonney2k	please stay subscribed to the mailinglist - you will notice that at some point people start to use your code :D
@sonney2k	but usually only when they get stock
@sonney2k	*stuck
@sonney2k	anyways, meeting is over from my side!
@sonney2k	you can stay here and keep on partying
 heiko	nice one :)
 alexlovesdata	thanks for the great organization effort Soeren!
@sonney2k	blackburn has some vodka for all of you ready
@sonney2k	virtual only though
@sonney2k	but hopefully next year we can organise some shogun mini conf
@sonney2k	(in berlin...)
 emrecelikten	Apparently I came in just in time
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	heiko, that reminds me - any news on the verein issue - otherwise we loose 50% of the money...
 gsomix	sonney2k, thanks
@sonney2k	that would just mean less travel support...
 heiko	sonney2k, argh, sorry, I will check that out now
@sonney2k	(next year)
 gsomix	may the Forc^W Carol Smith be with you
 heiko	sonney2k, I think a meeting would be very cool!
 wiking	heiko: i think i've got it :)
@sonney2k	pluskid, find out if you have vacations at MIT or if there is a conference in germany you need to attend!
 heiko	wiking, great, send something
 wiking	heiko: i'll just double-check if it works smoothly on the ubuntu
 heiko	ok
 wiking	heiko: as now i've tested on my machine... it works w/o the gmock-config script
 pluskid	sonney2k: :D I know I can get free lunch from you
 alexlovesdata	hey blackburn: a world fusion approach for your thesis : http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/papers/2011/Zhu_Chen_Xing_NIPS11.pdf
 blackburn	pluskid: cheng: mind to join some channel to discuss? it could be some flood like to discuss here
@sonney2k	alright - I have to get kids from kindergarden but just ignore me - keep on partying
 pluskid	blackburn: cool, how to set up a channel?
 gsomix	time to work
 blackburn	just join #shogun2
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: what to do with it?
 blackburn	:D
 alexlovesdata	read it :)
 alexlovesdata	it is sufficiently unusual to be YOUR thesis
 alexlovesdata	in the discriminative part you can do everything
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: you mean just copy that and treat it as my thesis? :D
 heiko	I also gotta go, wiking, I will check back on the testing later this evening
 blackburn	sounds like russian science
 alexlovesdata	aehmmm, we are NOT in social sciences, blackburn!
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-185-9-87.range86-185.btcentralplus.com] has left #shogun []
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I am unsure what does it mean
 alexlovesdata	in principle they interpret bayes rule as an optimization problem
 alexlovesdata	then they can add an additional penalty on the space of probabilistic models
 alexlovesdata	they are doing something like probabilistic mixture of local svms
 alexlovesdata	their idea is fun
 alexlovesdata	a mixture of both worlds ;)
 wiking	wtf :)))))
 alexlovesdata	I need to read it in detail ,too
 wiking	why no libgtest.so ?!
 wiking	on ubuntu
 blackburn	hmm
 alexlovesdata	would that be the next GSoC 2013 project? :D
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: okay I will check that
 wiking	there's libgtest-dev with header files but no actual libgtest
 alexlovesdata	blackburn: are you satill pursuing ILSRVC
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: wiking does
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I am waiting for thing I can help with
 wiking	but now i'm truing this shitfuck:)))
 wiking	why no gtest library on ubuntu
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I have ~0 clue about that kind of recognition :)
 wiking	doh
 wiking	something is wrong with ubuntu :)

 wiking	blackburn: u have the latest ubuntu right?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	ok just a sec to cehck out something
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so can u download compile& install this
 wiking	http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip
 wiking	as u won't have package of it
 blackburn	okay let me try
 wiking	ah before
 wiking	do this
 wiking	sudo apt-get install google-mock
 wiking	and once ready check out the HEAD of shogun/master
 wiking	and try to run ./configure script
 wiking	and give --libs=<where u've installed libgtest>
 wiking	and paste here what's the output of ./configure script for google c++ mocking framework

 blackburn	wiking: so how can I install gtest to some default dir
 wiking	good question
 wiking	i'm trying on some other machine now :)
 wiking	ok
 wiking	well this is rather a huge hack
 wiking	but fuck it i mean i don't know what were actually ubuntu people thinking to supply a -dev package of a library w/o the actual library
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	sudo cp lib/.libs/libgtest.so* /usr/local/lib
 wiking	sudo cp lib/.libs/libgtest_main.so* /usr/loca/lib

 blackburn	well it is detected now
 wiking	so do it like that
 wiking	try to compile the whole libshogun

 blackburn	wiking: I was thinking about static analysis of code
 wiking	blackburn: so?
 blackburn	have an opinion on that?
 wiking	compiled?
 wiking	or what's happening :)
 blackburn	I mean we could use static analysis to track some bugs
 blackburn	treehydra would work
 blackburn	or sparse
 blackburn	do you have any experience in that?
 wiking	mm not really
 wiking	how's your unit testing?
 blackburn	will try in a minute
 wiking	ok
 wiking	there's one coming with clang
 wiking	http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/
 wiking	pretty cool
 wiking	i've tried it couple of times

 wiking	it has some funny reports ;)
 blackburn	wiking: clang one?
 wiking	yeps
 wiking	i'll put the report somewhere
 blackburn	yeah interesting to see
 wiking	just let it finish
 wiking	compilation is much slower of course

 wiking	:)
 blackburn	I know the method probably
 blackburn	can't agree with analyzer
 wiking	heheh funny ones

 blackburn	okay this 530 one is not a bug
 blackburn	but good it points it
 blackburn	that*
 wiking	blackburn: is there a check for kernel_cache.activenum != 0?

 blackburn	wiking: it just should not happend but no, no check
 wiking	blackburn: well then at least an ASSERT()
 wiking	if it should not happen
 blackburn	that's a good thing I should say

 wiking	ok
 wiking	i have the report
 blackburn	let me see full report of that thing
 wiking	let me check how i can share it
 blackburn	I will put a few asserts
 Marina_	hello, can anyone help me by the arts application? i get the following error when by running art.py:
 Marina_	Usage: arts.py [options] seq.fa  arts.py: error: incorrect number of arguments
 blackburn	Marina_: how do you execute it?
 blackburn	exact command line string I mean
 Marina_	python arts.py
 wiking	blackburn: http://maeth.com/shogun-report/
 blackburn	you should provide some sequence files for that
 blackburn	wiking: cool thanks
 wiking	blackburn: have fun :) should i post it on mailinglist?
 blackburn	Marina_: e.g. ./arts.py data/ARTS.dat.bz2
 blackburn	oh it fails in current build :D
 Marina_	ah ok, i try

 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	will try to
 wiking	blackburn: heheh nice memory leak reports :)
 wiking	blackburn: there's on in slep
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	mmm i guess it would be a good idea to have this automatically generated :)
 blackburn	exactly
 wiking	mmm should we set it up somewhere ?:)
 wiking	i mean of course it depends as well which static analyser we want to use
 wiking	i used this one because i had it at hand
 blackburn	Marina_: okay I recall I tried to fix that but do not remember the root cause
 blackburn	I will check now and try to fix
 Marina_	thank you!!
 Marina_	the arts programm will show me the important transcription starts, or?
 blackburn	Marina_: I'd like to help you if I knew anything about transcription starts or anything like that :D
 Marina_	:-)
 blackburn	it detects something and it fails on creating string features
 blackburn	that's what I know
 blackburn	:D
 Marina_	thats super - thats enough ;-)
 blackburn	interesting
 wiking	blackburn: so nullpointer dereferencing fixes are coming up from u ?:)
 blackburn	yes everything from me
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	blackburn: i'll fix the so part
 blackburn	ah ok
 wiking	the memleaks
 wiking	blackburn: what should be with the Undefined allocation of 0 bytes (CERT MEM04-C; CWE-131) errors? :)
 blackburn	wiking: no idea what it is
 wiking	well that it can happen that u call malloc with 0 bytes
 blackburn	hmm just assert it then
 wiking	ok i think i'll push this mem leak fix
 wiking	but i need uricamic to comment on it
 wiking	so don't merge it
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	Marina_: hah okay it was my bad
 blackburn	it works ok - I just said wrong thing
 Marina_	ok
 blackburn	Marina_: you need to put a fasta file after ./arts.py
 Marina_	which should i use?
 blackburn	well the one you want to detect (something) in
 blackburn	afaik by default it uses trained model
 blackburn	from that file
 Marina_	but thats the file we used -- data/ARTS.dat.bz2
 blackburn	no, it is a model and it is loaded by default
 blackburn	you need to specify fasta file containing sequencies you want to work with
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	it works with single sequence
 blackburn	okay updated
 Marina_	is there any example for such a file -- how the input have to be`?
 blackburn	Marina_: for example you need to detect what it detects in some sequence
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	just sequences
 blackburn	in line
 blackburn	sequence* sorry
 blackburn	so just create some file file.fa and put some sequence
 blackburn	and ./arts.py file.fa will do something with trained model
 Marina_	i try --- thanks!!
 blackburn	I should learn about bioinf more :D
 blackburn	however it is kind of legacy for us now
 wiking	looooooooooooooool
 wiking	this is really heavy weaight
 wiking	weight
 wiking	http://maeth.com/shogun-report/report-kbc54l.html#EndPath
 wiking	:DD
 wiking	i think i've found the bug why the multiclass results were not so good :DDD
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	why?
 wiking	check that link
 wiking	and you'll see
 wiking	SO multiclass i mean
 wiking	blackburn: got it? :)
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	if score > max_score
 blackburn	then
 blackburn	score = max_score
 blackburn	INTERESTING
 blackburn	it provides nice output
 blackburn	we must have it on buildbot
 wiking	blackburn: and then on the end
 wiking	max_score is used
 blackburn	yeah let me fix it
 wiking	i'll fix it :)
 wiking	i'm in structure :D
 blackburn	ah ok
 wiking	fuck
 wiking	this shit is good
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	we need this shit running automatically
 Marina_	mhh, i have put 2 sequences into testfile.fa :  ACCTTTTTGAAAA    and TTTTATACCATAT    and there comes the error
 wiking	n4nd0 where are you!?
 Marina_	loading model file......................done number of chunks for contig: 1 processing chunk #0 [ERROR] assertion max_string_length>=window_size || (single_string && length_of_single_string>=window_size) failed in file features/StringFeatures.cpp line 1197 Traceback (most recent call last):   File "arts.py", line 64, in <module>     preds = arts.predict(seq)   File "/home/mvidovic/POIM/ARTS/signal_sensor.py", line 199, in predict    
 blackburn	Marina_: it should be bigger
 blackburn	Marina_: your string has lenght less than window size
 Marina_	oh :-)
 blackburn	let me find the window size
 wiking	blackburn: i've requested uricamic to comment on that PR... let's hope he agrees
 blackburn	okay
 wiking	blackburn: i wonder if ASSERT will remove these nullpointer dereferencing errors
 blackburn	well it should
 blackburn	wiking: one bad thing about require macro - it has to be in { } with if
 blackburn	in other case it will be expanded to if if
 blackburn	if () REQUIRE() else ... will produce if () if () else
 wiking	man this bug is crazy  :))
 blackburn	which?
 wiking	this with max_score :)
 wiking	i'll have to see the difrerence
 blackburn	Marina_: oops sorry
 blackburn	format is
 blackburn	> anything
 blackburn	and then sequence
 blackburn	so fasta with single file
 Marina_	? i dont understand
 Marina_	anything?
 Marina_	can you spot the right window_size?
 blackburn	it is 140
 blackburn	with default model
 Marina_	ah thanks
 Marina_	and what do you mean with :
 Marina_	anything [21:23] <blackburn> and then sequence
 wiking	shit with the fucking mosek :DDD
 blackburn	> 0 label=1
 blackburn	ACTGGGATAATTTGAAACAATAAATTTTTTTTTGAATTGTAGGTGTCCTGCTTGCATCCA
 blackburn	AAGGAGTCGATGATGTTGAGCA
 blackburn	Marina_: ^
 blackburn	but sequence should have length greater than 140
 blackburn	will not work with tweets :D
 blackburn	wiking: great idea to tweet something like that ^, right? :D
 wiking	:DDD
 blackburn	wiking: ACTGCCATTACGCA!

 blackburn	puffin444: hey puffin444
 blackburn	whoa that was recursive
 blackburn	puffin444: I wanted to ask a few thing
 blackburn	s
 puffin444	lol how was the meeting?
 puffin444	oh sure
 blackburn	well we were having vodka and dance a little
 blackburn	I completely missed your gradient evaluation stuff
 blackburn	is that the thing that learns a gp on top of results?
 blackburn	or is that model selection for gps?
 puffin444	what do you need concerning gtadient evaluation?
 blackburn	what is the method
 puffin444	they are the same
 blackburn	:D
 Marina_	blackburn: the assertion error is still there
 blackburn	can that work for svm?
 blackburn	Marina_: what is length of your sequence?
 puffin444	assertion error?
 Marina_	2500
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	that's pretty strange, okay
 blackburn	Marina_: how your input file look like? can you paste it via http://pastebin.com/?
 blackburn	puffin444: so can that work with general machine?
 blackburn	or is that the thing to select parameters for gp regression machine?
 puffin444	the gradient framework should be applicable to anything with a differentiable function class
 blackburn	any example of that?
 Marina_	ahhhh it works
 puffin444	if you encounter problems with it, please let me know
 blackburn	nice to hear
 blackburn	puffin444: can I learn svm's C with that?
 puffin444	I have not tried it with something other than a gp
 Marina_	thank you very much blackburn
 blackburn	there is no gradient for sure, but what are other examples of differentiable evaluations?
 blackburn	Marina_: no problem, let me know if there are more problems with it
 puffin444	but it should work in theory as long as it can work with the interface
 blackburn	puffin444: okay other issue
 puffin444	no examples yet except for inference method class
 puffin444	yes?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	there was a class with eigen members
 blackburn	did you fix that already?
 puffin444	yes that should be fitcinference method

 blackburn	y
 blackburn	puffin444: can we avoid it somehow?
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey!
 n4nd0	wiking: thank you for the bug
 wiking	n4nd0: heavy shit :D
 puffin444	errors? warnings? I found no errors on my machine, but there are warnings that appear to come from an incorrect config on my box
 n4nd0	BTW there is another bug I found this morning
 n4nd0	wiking: :D
 wiking	n4nd0: but now it performs really good :))))
 puffin444	no more eigen?
 n4nd0	cool
 wiking	n4nd0: but never would have found it w/o blackburn's idea to do a static analysis
 blackburn	puffin444: I mean if we have eigen in headers it has to be in included path
 n4nd0	wiking, blackburn: then I own you both a beer :)
 wiking	:P
 n4nd0	blackburn: it can be vodka too :P
 blackburn	puffin444:  if it is in .cpp - it is not a dependency
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 puffin444	yes. dont I use just the .h file from shogun though? do I directly reference eigen anywhere?
 blackburn	puffin444: I am not sure I got what you mean
 puffin444	oh sry you mean in the cpp files
 blackburn	puffin444: easiest solution I have in mind is to use Map from eigen
 blackburn	do you know how to use it?
 puffin444	not sure
 wiking	:>>
 blackburn	puffin444: for example Map<VectorXd> somevector(pointer); will produce something that acts just like VectorXd
 puffin444	so should I just reference the cmap header if I want to use eigen?
 puffin444	oh ok
 blackburn	puffin444: this way you can map SGMatrices to eigen ones
 puffin444	oh I see so that I can just use one set instead of having both eigen and shogun matrices
 blackburn	puffin444: we have to avoid eigen members because in other way we have to add eigen include path everywhere - in tests/examples and even add a dependency in .deb package
 blackburn	yeah just map it with Map<>
 puffin444	I go ahead and work on this. by the way I have a tuorial underway
 blackburn	puffin444: here comes the example - http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TutorialMapClass.html
 puffin444	sorry if I was absent the last few days. I had to pack up and I am currently on route to Pittsburgh
 blackburn	I see
