 Guest88299	Hello
 Guest88299	I'm trying to run shogun 2.0.0 with code and data that run fine under shogun 1.1.0
 Guest88299	but I get this error:TypeError: Cannot create new instances of type 'Labels'
 Guest88299	I think this is the samep problem that is mentioned here:http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2643 - but is unsolved
 Guest88299	any ideas?
 shogun-buildbot	build #120 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/120

 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: hey
 wiking	blackburn: u were looking for me
 wiking	?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	these guys from company I am applying to want me to analyze https://imagecategorizer.services.open.xerox.com/
 blackburn	I'd appreciate if you share any thoughts :)
 wiking	lol
 wiking	they've opensourced it?
 wiking	no
 wiking	it's just the service
 blackburn	heh right
 blackburn	that makes the task a task
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	it's quite nice
 wiking	have you tried to upload images?
 blackburn	yes, quite a lot already
 wiking	how is it?
 wiking	btw: it's fun to upload dummy images :D
 blackburn	well I put some blender images
 blackburn	and smoothed/inverted/colored images, etc
 wiking	i'm trying this http://412.laxallstars.com/files/2011/07/Brown.jpeg
 wiking	but it says there's high traffic now
 blackburn	I tried green plane
 wiking	and?
 blackburn	wanted it to think it is a grass
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	no category at all
 wiking	mmm that's good
 blackburn	actually
 blackburn	check ILSVRC 2011
 blackburn	these guys won it :)
 blackburn	probably it is the same system
 wiking	yeah i know their work
 wiking	mostly based on fisher vector
 wiking	right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	product quantization
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	linear svm
 blackburn	and fisher vectors
 blackburn	SIFT + color histograms
 wiking	yep yep
 wiking	i know that one
 blackburn	do you know how can I prove that it is a sift?
 wiking	csurka is leading their group
 wiking	mmm good question
 blackburn	some computer vision hacking
 blackburn	I was thinking about it
 blackburn	but nothing except blurring
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	well yeah u should trick sift
 wiking	well what could be actually a funny thing to do
 wiking	is to seed a random image
 wiking	with some patches/sift keypoints of a chicken picture
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	I want to backtrace feature building
 wiking	i bet that's possible
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	I thought of skating horse
 wiking	and that the image u construct is still not a chicken :)
 wiking	ehhehe
 blackburn	I will do that tomorrow
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	well but still
 blackburn	I tried same thing actually
 blackburn	yesterday I took a hockey player image
 blackburn	and just 'cut' his legs
 blackburn	'skating' category disappeared
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	niice
 blackburn	proves that it is a local feature thing
 wiking	so you think puting the skaters on a horse
 wiking	would do some trick :)
 wiking	as said
 blackburn	yeah horse on skates would make these guys laugh at least
 wiking	:)
 wiking	take a simple sift extractor
 wiking	and get some patches
 wiking	and randomly distribute that in a dummy image
 blackburn	why do you think it proves the SIFTness?
 wiking	and then maybe get 2 sets of differetn sift features (from 2 different image categories) and start randomly mixing them in a new dummy image
 blackburn	I am thinking about something very special about SIFT
 blackburn	blurring is one thing - gradients go worse with it
 wiking	well
 wiking	one good thing is an affine transform of the image
 wiking	to check what type of sift they are using
 wiking	the default sift implementation is not so good with affine transformation
 blackburn	hmm right right
 blackburn	rotations is what I didn't try yet
 blackburn	good idea
 wiking	well not only rotate
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	but like rotate and make a trapezoid of the original image
 wiking	for example with the eiffel tower
 blackburn	well I'll try some fisheye
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	to see whether it is robust
 blackburn	wiking: do you understand what is a way to handle multiple patches but within the same dimension of feature space?
 blackburn	that's the thing I miss
 wiking	blackburn: eh?
 wiking	blackburn: i guess they could use some pca
 wiking	as they usually do in their system at xerox
 blackburn	I mean if one image has 3 patches
 blackburn	and other has 9
 blackburn	how pca could help there?
 wiking	well they don't give a damnfuck about the number of patches
 wiking	as they calculate in a way a frequency vector
 wiking	of the patches
 wiking	of the number of various patches
 blackburn	ahhh
 wiking	that is then normalised
 wiking	so that's your feature vector, i.e. the fisher vector
 wiking	in the case of xerox
 blackburn	so # of features is just ~ to # of possible visual words?
 wiking	yep yep
 wiking	usual drill
 blackburn	got it
 wiking	the fisher vector is something like a bag of visual words
 wiking	a bit more scientific
 wiking	but on the end it is basically doing that
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	more clear now
 wiking	heheh welcome :)
 blackburn	thanks
 wiking	hack the shit out of their system :))
 wiking	if i'd have time i'd really help
 blackburn	yeah, I should try to hack out sift
 wiking	because this way you could prove some funky security stuff
 blackburn	no problem you helped a lot already
 wiking	or let say
 wiking	how to SEO and image search engine :P
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	afaik this has been not really exploited yet
 wiking	but for sure it can be
 wiking	as all the keypoint extractors
 wiking	are very very
 wiking	academic
 wiking	so they must have several flaws
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: what are you working on btw?

 wiking	RebeccaTruty: where?
 RebeccaTruty	oh sorry, here: http://pastebin.com/FczYqj40
 wiking	RebeccaTruty: oh yeah
 wiking	the thing is that Labels class has been majorly redesign
 wiking	so you'll have to change your code
 RebeccaTruty	I see
 wiking	so in this case
 wiking	use DenseLabels
 wiking	wait
 wiking	random.choice([0.0, 1.0])
 wiking	gives you 0 or 1 or a random number in [0,1] interval?
 RebeccaTruty	it give you a 1 or 0
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	then just use
 wiking	BinaryLabels
 RebeccaTruty	great, thanks
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CBinaryLabels.html
 wiking	that's the doxygen for the class
 wiking	but yeah it shoudl work
 wiking	if you just replace
 wiking	test_labels = Labels(np.array(raw_labels, dtype=np.double))
 wiking	to
 RebeccaTruty	yup, thanks, sorry I didn't realize it was such a stupid question - I shoudl have looked into it more
 wiking	test_labels = BinaryLabels(np.array(raw_labels, dtype=np.double))
 wiking	RebeccaTruty: na no worries
 wiking	we just needed a bit more complex labeling system... :P
 RebeccaTruty	understood.  thanks for the help!
 wiking	no worries
 wiking	but next time i think you'd get a faster answer on the mailinglist of shogun
 wiking	mmm fuck where's the link on the new website to the mailing list :)
 wiking	sonney2k blackburn where's the mailing list information on the new website?
 wiking	ah ok i've found it
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/others
 blackburn	uh you were having kinda discussion
 wiking	blackburn: ehhehe no worries forget that i was messaging :P
 blackburn	somebody asked about labels thing yesterday
 blackburn	was that you, RebeccaTruty
 blackburn	?
 RebeccaTruty	yes - that was me
 blackburn	clear, I am sorry you've got to handle this transformation manually
 blackburn	we came to case where we had no other solution because of design gap
 RebeccaTruty	yeah, no problem, it should be an easy enough fix.
 wiking	blackburn: http://jrvis.com/trunk8/stars.html?rel=github
 blackburn	wiking: what's that/
 wiking	stargazers :D
 blackburn	my city is not highlighted, is that good? :)
 blackburn	ahhh who stars his project
 blackburn	wiking: find me!
 blackburn	there are only 5 in russia
 blackburn	wiking: sad no one from north korea

 blackburn	wiking: heheh he has good chiefs
 blackburn	beria and yezhov
 blackburn	wiking: did you know that once beria was killed gov't sent an order to all libraries
 blackburn	to cut down beria article in encyclopedia
 blackburn	and replace it with beringov proliv
