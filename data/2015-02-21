@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh that's why you're bayesian
@HeikoS	yeah exactly :)
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: exciting, meta language almost ready to merge
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: cool
@HeikoS	I think I will merge now actually
@HeikoS	and set up entrance tasks :)
@lisitsyn	yeah sure
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you got some time now?
@HeikoS	maybe
@HeikoS	I might disappear suddenly, but until then, yes :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'd like to explain you how can we get generic parameters
@lisitsyn	ready? :)
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	bam
@lisitsyn	hah

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Meta-Language: Initial implementation of meta-language parser.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Implements a basic grammar that parses a minimal example. The parser outputs the AST as JSON.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Adds a list of Shogun types and a script to re-generate this list.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * 2e00fa5 / examples/example-generation/ (10 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/2e00fa53e578e557a0dc81eec4bfa1658b0c935c
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Meta-Language: Adds translation program that translates parsed ASTs to target languages.
@lisitsyn	disappear?
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Adding target languages is supported through adding translation rule dictionaries to the targets folder
@lisitsyn	ah
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - A Python target is added
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Translation program keeps track of dependencies for import statements in the target languages
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * 905c7eb / examples/example-generation/ (7 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/905c7ebf19e45d810d2bebca53d0b17e9fb55654
@lisitsyn	ok
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok so the first way
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Modify parse.py and translate.py to not require JSON serialization of the AST
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * 4e68219 / examples/example-generation/ (2 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/4e682196c30449e9ed59b55cc3c2415b0ab1e969
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Meta-Language: Add R target
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Add R translation rules
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Add unit tests for r translations
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * 85244c2 / examples/example-generation/ (14 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/85244c28a65b6851755315731c30d74250c34380
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Meta-Language: Correct translation of types and import statements in Java target
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Extends grammar for enum constant usage - type of enums must now be specified explicitly
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Fix Java's import of enums
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Java target: hard code a type map from SGVector and SGMatrix types (RealVector, IntMatrix, etc.) to JBlas types (DoubleMatrix, FloatMatrix)
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * 96edc01 / examples/example-generation/ (6 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/96edc01ba85958650c8fda2478ed374f66b6969a
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Meta-Language: Extend interface of generate.py - now allows for input and output folder specification.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Update generate.py with new command line interface
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - Fix parse.py search path for the type list to be relative to parse.py's path
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Esben Sorig :develop * e759129 / / (14 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/e7591290f847ca98449aa575023a241283c8eb87
@lisitsyn	map<string, any>
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^ that's pretty simple but you've got to cast these things
@lisitsyn	you get("width") then cast it to the type you want
@lisitsyn	and it is not really good if you do it really often
@HeikoS	sure
@lisitsyn	okay the other way
@lisitsyn	probably we should go for this thing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: if you need to get width of kernel
@lisitsyn	you create tag<double>("width")
@lisitsyn	and do get(this_tag)
@lisitsyn	you don't have to cast type on get anymore, just the first time when you create this tag
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: performance wise when you create tag you hash it
@lisitsyn	then it is much faster
