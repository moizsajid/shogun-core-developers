 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, i see
@HeikoS	anyone here know how to use git? :)
@HeikoS	because I dont
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i'm not sure, but what is the problem?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add integration test for python_modular
@wiking	this one is about to be finished
@iglesiasg	wiking, cool!
 hushell	is it possible to disable a default constructor for a class derived from SGObject?
@wiking	HeikoS: this is your friend: ctest -D MemoryCheck
@HeikoS	wiking: what does it do? :)
@wiking	HeikoS: it runs valgrind on all the tests... out of box. i do not fucking have to do anything just define the tests...
@iglesiasg	hushell, what do you mean with disabling it?
@HeikoS	wiking: nice! :)
@HeikoS	wiking: add to the makefile and make it default!
@wiking	HeikoS: nono... this is cmake
@HeikoS	ah
@wiking	HeikoS: i'm not adding this to makefile ever
@iglesiasg	hushell, I saw that in FactorGraph you did at least one default constructor that basically raised an error, would that be enough?
@wiking	HeikoS: but today cmake env is going to be finished
@HeikoS	wiking: would be cool to have unit tests valgrinded by default
@HeikoS	wiking: nice!
@iglesiasg	in the FactorGraph PR, I mean
@wiking	sooo we could merge ;)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I don't want to have a default constructor, but make it private is not allowed
@HeikoS	wiking: I have some work to do, but will look into the ipython stuff later
@wiking	HeikoS: well yeah unit tests are part of tests ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: next thing that is urgent
@wiking	HeikoS: okok
@iglesiasg	hushell, what if you just don't do the default constructor? If there exists another constructor, if the default is not explicitly implemented then it does not exist (IIRC)
 hushell	iglesiasg: emm, no this will cause some unit tests fail
@wiking	HeikoS: and of course this would be great to have: http://cmake.org/Wiki/CTest/Coverage
 hushell	iglesiasg: but if someone call it by Class(), will be problematic
@HeikoS	wiking: wow that would be awesome to have
@wiking	HeikoS: it works with gcov
@HeikoS	then we can start dropping code since we know what is tested and what isnt :)
@wiking	anyhow again this can be done by simple 2 liner in cmake ;)
@wiking	so it's an urgent fucking thing to switch to cmake
@wiking	ah and one more thing
@wiking	the way i'm going to test cmake
@wiking	is to enable remote reporting ;P
@iglesiasg	hushell, well that is what you get if you want to disable the default constructor :D
@wiking	so once it's ready i'm going to announce to test it on the mailing list
@HeikoS	wiking: I totally agree
@wiking	and whoever runs the cmake build
@wiking	automatically will submit the buildlog to a site
@wiking	:P
@wiking	hence i can analyse if something is went wrong
@wiking	and nobody has to copypaste shit
 hushell	iglesiasg: okay, I need mention in the doc that never use default constructor :/
@wiking	i'll register here shogun: http://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=PublicDashboard#
@wiking	so that we dont have to run our own cdash server
@iglesiasg	hushell, mmm but can't we make some sort of workaround?
@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
@iglesiasg	hushell, I mean, why should it be not possible to use the default constructor? What is the scenario?
 lisitsyn	wiking: ja
 lisitsyn	what's up?
@wiking	lisitsyn: did u find out about the octave external lib path?
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh sorry I didn't manage to find anything on that
@wiking	when u have time could u look at it plz?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes this evening
@wiking	lisitsyn: cool thnx
@wiking	lisitsyn: see ctest in action: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/9730469 (scroll to the bottom)
@wiking	lisitsyn: the add_test(name ....) worked nicely
 hushell	iglesiasg: for example, I have a CDisjointSet, which need to specify the num of elements at very beginning
@iglesiasg	wiking, the remote reporting thing sounds awesome
@HeikoS	wiking: nice!
@iglesiasg	hushell, so that number of elements has to be specified because when calling other method of CDisjointSet it must be something, right?
 hushell	iglesiasg: yes, if the number is nothing, everything goes wrong I guess
@iglesiasg	hushell, what if the default constructor sets it to 0, -1 or a sentinel value; you provide a setter for the number of elements; and in the methods that need it to be something you ensure that this number is something
@iglesiasg	hushell, so you cool have two use cases:
 hushell	iglesiasg: this is I am doing set 1 for default case
 hushell	iglesiasg: but doesn't make sense indeed
@iglesiasg	hushell, well then just make sure that if this value has not been set in the constructor or by the setter, the stuff that you guess could go wrong is not executed
@iglesiasg	with a REQUIRE or if clause with SG_ERROR
@iglesiasg	hushell, what do you think?
 hushell	iglesiasg: sounds good, set -1 for default constructor and check if > 0 when calling other functions
@iglesiasg	hushell, yep
 hushell	Thanks for the REQUIRE! :)

@wiking	why we need newer?
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	thanks
@HeikoS	wiking: yes :)
@HeikoS	please
@HeikoS	although its bad to need 3.1
@wiking	mmm well travis will have only that
@HeikoS	what do you think? Can we make that a dependency?
@HeikoS	3.1?
@wiking	well how old is 3.1?
@wiking	i mean travis is a simple ubuntu
@wiking	not the latest i think it's LTS
@HeikoS	3.2 is out already
@HeikoS	stable
@wiking	but still ubuntu is quite frequently updated
@wiking	imagine somebody comes with a centos
@wiking	100% that he will not have eigen 3.1 within 2 years :P
@HeikoS	3.1 was release june 2012
@wiking	i'm just saying...
@HeikoS	mmmh
@wiking	well we can still make it dependent
@HeikoS	mmmmmh
@HeikoS	wiking: sorry gotta go
@wiking	and in worst case cmake can download it for shogun :P

 thoralf	iglesiasg: Aloah.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, you were using eclipse with shogun, right?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Yes and no - since last friday it's crashing all the time and I stopped using it. ;)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: But maybe I can help. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, oh I see
@iglesiasg	thoralf, I was in the mood of trying java_modular so I thought it might be a good idea to have it set up with eclipse
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I have never tried to setup a project based on the modular interfaces, sorry.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, all right. Thanks anyway!

@iglesiasg	pickle27, I took a quick look at your PR yesterday, I am going to write a couple of comments now about something I didn't quite understand
@iglesiasg	pickle27, if you have a moment, help me with the please :)
 pickle27	iglesiasg: okay
 pickle27	iglesiasg: I am actually defending my thesis in an hour so I probably won't get to it until tomorrow
@iglesiasg	pickle27, oh sure, never mind then. I will write then later, no distraction now!
@iglesiasg	pickle27, good luck with it!
 pickle27	iglesiasg: thanks!

 pickle27	iglesiasg: basically those new lines in SGInterface are telling the interface that there is a rhs return arg
@iglesiasg	pickle27, rhs return arg as an argument by reference?
 pickle27	right hand side
@iglesiasg	yes, but what did you mean with return arg?
@iglesiasg	rhs agree, but return? :)
 pickle27	oh so if the shogun call returns something you need to tell the interface
 pickle27	then it checks for it and returns whatever it is properly
 pickle27	so its return by value sort of
@iglesiasg	pickle27, aham, ok so the return values in static interface are also passed as right hand side arguments?
@iglesiasg	sorry if that is a stupid question :)
 pickle27	iglesiasg: kind of, to be honest I don't know fully how the interface works
@iglesiasg	pickle27, hehe ok
@iglesiasg	pickle27, anyway what is the logic beneath the new checks?
 pickle27	I looked at how the 'classify' function worked because it returns data and the saw what was missing from my new function that needed to return data
 pickle27	iglesiasg: its copied from the classify function
 pickle27	its telling the interface that its going to have to return something
@iglesiasg	pickle27, oh ok, that makes one feel safer indeed hehe
 pickle27	yeah without that line it doesn't return anything
@iglesiasg	oh really? I would never have guessed that
 pickle27	yeah me either
 pickle27	it depends on the interface, because the return arg is still set even if you don't tell the interface that one exists
 pickle27	it actually worked in octave static without it but not in R and thats when I found the fix
@iglesiasg	pickle27, it still works in octave though, right?
 pickle27	yeah
 pickle27	iglesiasg: you can take a look at cmd_classify line 4584 in SGInterface.cpp
 pickle27	thats how I figured out what to do
 pickle27	anyways I've got to go!
 pickle27	see you guys tomorrow!

@sonney2k	foulwall, nice thanks!
@wiking	sonney2k: how do u imagine the ./configure -> cmake transition?
@sonney2k	wiking, rm configure and related scripts and done
@sonney2k	wiking, but I would want your cmake stuff merged first and enable it on the buildbots
@wiking	sonney2k: ok so as i thought merge it
@wiking	and then use it
@wiking	and then if everything is ok remove the old scripts

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am a bit hmmhh about http://nn.7nn.de:8000/tapkee/entrance the tapkee dimred examples
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, this is totally static right?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I mean would it be possible to dynamically generate such embedding in *short* time?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, IIRC it takes a bit of time for a demo to generate am embedding like that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, how much?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I would rather prefer smaller sample sizes etc but a *real* demo
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am not sure. I don't remember exactly
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I can run it here in a few minutes if you like
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@206.225.135.24] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, would be nice
@sonney2k	foulwall, we have to improve the dimension reduction / tapkee examples a bit to make them interactive
@sonney2k	foulwall, currently it is just static (boring) stuff
 van51	sonney2k: hi
@sonney2k	foulwall, another question - could we have some tree?
@sonney2k	foulwall, sth like this https://www.biomedcentral.com/content/figures/1471-2105-5-126-1-l.jpg
 van51	sonney2k: first of all, for the normalization in the converter, I can't compare it directly to the dotfeatures
@sonney2k	van51, hey!
@sonney2k	van51, why not?
@wiking	HeikoS: yo
 van51	sonney2k: because whenever the hashed vector is needed there we compute it through the converter
@wiking	HeikoS: actually what's the status of the foundation?
 van51	sonney2k: and it only performs its own hashing in the dense_dot and add_to_dense methods
@HeikoS	wiking: stalled
@wiking	HeikoS: should not
@HeikoS	wiking: there are some other more important things unfortunately
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, the one with Oksana's faces takes almost no time
@wiking	it is important as well!
@HeikoS	my work (1 week intense since NIPS reviews), google PO (I have problems with my bank) and other things
@HeikoS	wiking: I know
@HeikoS	but not as important as the other ones
 van51	sonney2k: so what I have done in the unit test is compare the result of the dense_dot method
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, nice then :)
 van51	sonney2k: but as I said the result must be different due to numerical rounding errors and stuff
@sonney2k	van51, I don't understand why it should not be possible
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, about 0.015 seconds in total
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, too fast ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no svm is as fast as this
 van51	sonney2k: well, for instance in the dot method of the dotfeatures, where the full hashed vector is needed
 van51	sonney2k: it is computed from the converter
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, there are no many images though, but I think more than enough for a demo
@sonney2k	van51, you could do dot_features->get_computed_dot_feature_vector() and it should be directly comparable to your sparse vector
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, maybe a demo inspired by these images could be cool. Like the user takes a few screenshots with a webcam
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah but later I am currently rather only wanting to have static input all the rest is a security nightmare
 van51	sonney2k: how is that calculated? through which method?
 van51	sonney2k: i'll check it actually
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I understand

@sonney2k	for what?
@sonney2k	yeah well if your script is python then yes.
 van51	sonney2k: ok so it outputs the same result :)
@sonney2k	van51, alright then so you should get the same result then for whatever kernel (if you dot is correct - this is not covered in this test)

 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi there?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: hi!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: sampling the approximate posterior is quite hard
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, btw when i changed implementation your example works well :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: what did you change?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: solve L*L^T * B = I
@HeikoS	votjakovr: as you had it before?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep
@HeikoS	votjakovr: cool, could you send a patch, then I will try
 votjakovr	HeikoS: anyway matrix K looks like symetric
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I know its also easy to fix that via taking 0.5*(K+K^T)
@HeikoS	but the problem really are the eigenvalues that sometimes get massively negative, if you try larger kernel sizes you will see
 votjakovr	HeikoS: so is L*L^t * B = I more appropriate in our case?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah whatever makes this thing work :)
@HeikoS	send a patch, I will have a look and try it tomorrow then
@HeikoS	votjakovr: still a bit weird that this makes such a difference
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, it's weird, i agree
@HeikoS	votjakovr: in fact, one doesnt need the covariance matrix itself, but rather its cholesky decomposition
@HeikoS	votjakovr: if there was a stable method for that, that would be awesome
