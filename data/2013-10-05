@sonney2k	and all the fancy eye candy
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://pirate-party.ru/content/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BA-nasa-%D0%B2-%D1%81%D0%B2%D1%8F%D0%B7%D0%B8-%D1%81-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BC-%D0%B8%D1%85-%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%82%D0%B0
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: hah
 HeikoS	sonney2k: how are the notebooks on the webiste coming along?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what besser82 said?
 lisitsyn	:D
 HeikoS	sonney2k: whats the state of the MLOSS downloader?
 HeikoS	is there a demo or something?

@sonney2k	HeikoS, no one fixed the notebooks?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, or did you?
 HeikoS	sonney2k: no, what I mean is is there a link already for the abstract? or where will they be? might fix some later
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ???
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/notebook/
 HeikoS	I would like to put a link to the notebook list to the abstract
 HeikoS	exactly that :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we agreed to use the first paragraph (markdown text)
 HeikoS	ok cool, why is it on "contact"?
@sonney2k	but it shouldn't contain formulas or everything is b0rken
 HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well notebooks need fixing
 HeikoS	ah thats why the abstract is now there right
 HeikoS	?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, it is just the first IIRC 500 chars of the first markdown section of the notebook
@sonney2k	so this can be arbitrarily crappy
 HeikoS	sonney2k: doesnt seem to handle math when I open them?
 HeikoS	sonney2k: why this extra window opening? rather than just a new tab?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well I made it like this - my plan would be that we have instead of the screenshots at the bottom screenshots of notebooks that one could click at
@sonney2k	HeikoS, and then this should open in an overlay
 HeikoS	I see, ok
 HeikoS	sonney2k: and the math?
 HeikoS	not on the preview but in the notebook itself?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I guess due to the b0rken abstracts
@sonney2k	since this worked before I showed them
@sonney2k	HeikoS, btw bessel said that we will get news coverage
 HeikoS	bessel?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, besse82
@sonney2k	are
 HeikoS	sonney2k: ok, so fixing them will help
 HeikoS	writing the abstract now, will put in this link for example
 HeikoS	the opencv factory one will also be useful ;)
 HeikoS	sonney2k: is the mloss downloader in a state that it can be exposed?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, try it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, don't ask me
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ask cheng and try it :P
@sonney2k	HeikoS, seen fernando's PR?
@sonney2k	I think the template is good!
@sonney2k	he wants to render the 2nd markdown notebook section though
@sonney2k	HeikoS, http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/iglesias/shogun/2c4faa0930447493969798ce3d76c3cae4c4ac64/doc/ipython-notebooks/template.ipynb
 wiking	afaik 'matplotlib inline' isn't necessary
 wiking	it's up to the notebook server conf

 lisitsyn	what do you want to put here?
 HeikoS	would it be possible to publish the abstract on our webpage, providing links to the things it mentions?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: like a "why is shogun cool" page
 HeikoS	or even replacing the features page
@sonney2k	sure
