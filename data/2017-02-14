 mikeling	wiking: hi, is this the right way to use valgrind to test the unit test ? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8979252
@wiking	please read about valgrind memory check
@wiking	there's millions of
@wiking	exampels
@wiking	but yeah this is how you call knn unit tests
@wiking	mikeling, http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html
@wiking	http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/tools/valgrind/
 mikeling	hmmm,  I haven't found memory leaking for knn as you mentioned in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608#discussion_r100508822, so do I need to check some other unit test ? maybe I miss some other KNN related test?
@wiking	that's weird
@wiking	because there's
@wiking	in your code
@wiking	i mean pasted part
@wiking	==20959==    definitely lost: 1,976 bytes in 8 blocks
@wiking	==20959==    indirectly lost: 17,341 bytes in 295 blocks
@wiking	so there's definitely memory leak
