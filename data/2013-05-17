@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	I never think hard
 shogun-buildbot	build #1125 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1125  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
@lisitsyn	I hardly think hard
@sonney2k	I am just too soft
@lisitsyn	then I fall asleep
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: okay one solution
@lisitsyn	a) add a base class like DenseFeaturesDataKeeper
@lisitsyn	b) inherit a template class from it
@lisitsyn	c) add constructors for densefeatures for all supported types
@lisitsyn	where we create appropriate data keeper
@sonney2k	yeah void* would be a solution
 van51	sonney2k: I think the problem is when you call DynArray::insert_element and the array is empty
@sonney2k	van51, very well possible
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: not really voide
@lisitsyn	void*
 van51	after it has at least one element it's ok
@sonney2k	van51, plesae write a unit test and fix it
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: let me try that this weekend and we will see
@sonney2k	van51, I think it is also troublesome to call insert_* with an index >= number_of_elements
 van51	sonney2k: ok, but can it wait until tomorrow?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do you expect really significant speedup with that?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, with what?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: with no templates exposed
@sonney2k	template removal?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, just try it
@sonney2k	remove all %template from .i
 van51	sonney2k: I was thinking about that, but I didn't see any index checks on the array classes
 van51	so I thought it was up to the user to do it correctly
@sonney2k	van51, yeah it was intended like this
 van51	sonney2k: I'll try and fix it tomorrow
 van51	and will provide some unit tests
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what do we lost this way is compile time typechecking
@lisitsyn	which is relevant for C++
@lisitsyn	I mean if I add that thing we get runtime typechecking
@lisitsyn	but if you do sth like set_feature_vector(some sgvector of wrong type)
@lisitsyn	you get no error in C++
@iglesiasg	good night guys, I am falling asleep on the keyboard :D
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: same here actually
@lisitsyn	good night

@wiking	sonne|work: ping? shall we have a c4.5 and c5.0 implementation in shogun... as i'm now starting from scratch the random forest implementation so i realised that it's good to have decision trees implemented
@wiking	sonne|work: moreover: do anybody is planning to do this in gsoc? so just that i dont take somebody's project...
 sonne|work	wiking: well there is no OSS implementation of C4.5 and C5.0 code is only slightly better den cat /dev/unrandom
 sonne|work	wiking: but yes feel free
 sonne|work	wiking: you could port weka's j45 over to shogun
 sonne|work	might be the most readable...
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i want first random forest ASAP
@wiking	but then i'll do some other tree implementation as well
 sonne|work	well random forest == some tree impl but just bagged on top
@wiking	yeps
 sonne|work	I think the correct approach would be
 sonne|work	to do a BaggedClassifier
 sonne|work	that just trains the same classifier a couple of times
 sonne|work	using some sampling scheme
 sonne|work	of the training data points
 sonne|work	then you can fit in *any* other classifier
 sonne|work	like svm / tree / knn
 sonne|work	and you have your random forest as subset
@lisitsyn	heyya
@wiking	yep
@wiking	sounds reasonable
@wiking	mmm my battery is running low

 sonne|work	push push
@lisitsyn	haha
 sonne|work	why must it be that difficult...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: because we are barbarians
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	vodka drinking babarians
 sonne|work	riding polar bears
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: at least I don't have to proceed through interview
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: like for usa

@lisitsyn	trying to work right now
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: trying to make multiagent planning system work :D

@lisitsyn	sonne|work: that's the definition of hype
@lisitsyn	not the deep learning
@lisitsyn	MAS is pure hype
@lisitsyn	from 90s :D
@lisitsyn	but we live 20 years back from the other world so it is here
 sonne|work	let me add the 'big data', 'data science' crappy do to this list
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: haha big data yes
 sonne|work	what is big

 lambday	lisitsyn: hi
@lisitsyn	lambday: hey
 lambday	I did a rebase... and after that doing make-unittests gives an error.... apparently CMath:init_random has been changed..
 lambday	wait let me paste
@lisitsyn	yeah that would be better
 lambday	In function `shogun::CMath::init_random(unsigned int)':
 lambday	In function `shogun::CMath::init_random(unsigned int)':
 lambday	shit... wait!
 lambday	Math.h:458: undefined reference to `shogun::CMath::rand_state
 lambday	but now its been replaced with something else, I just checked
 foulwall	sonne|work: sonney2k, could I start a django app for each demo, or make a classification such as supervised, unsupervised etc and start apps for each of it , or just start a 'demo' app and include all the demos in it?
@lisitsyn	lambday: did you try to clean up that thing? sounds like something related to recent changes in random
 lambday	why it would give this error then? I freshly did a make and my src shows new CMath
 lambday	lisitsyn: I did git pull --rebase upstream develop, and the make clean and make
 lambday	lisitsyn: yes... seems so
@lisitsyn	I think not all things are properly updated in tests
 lambday	lisitsyn: I think the unit-tests just makes a init_random() call... whose definition in CMath has been changed... should be fine, right?
@lisitsyn	lambday: so did clean help
@lisitsyn	?
 lambday	lisitsyn: nope! :(
@lisitsyn	ehmm
 lambday	clueless :-/
 lambday	shall I try cloning somewhere else and then rebase and test again?
@wiking	lambday: actually init_random did not change
@lisitsyn	lambday: no makes no sense for me
@wiking	it's just PRNG behind it is changed
@wiking	but the API is the same
 lambday	wiking: hmm... the error shows undefined reference to CMath::rand_state, I checked and it was there previously, now changed
@wiking	yes
@wiking	but then you have a problem
@wiking	that you dont have the latest CMath.h/cpp
 lambday	wiking: I do :( I checked and it shows the new init_random()
 lambday	totally weird :-/
 lambday	may be I'm doing something wrong - let me check again
 sonne|work	foulwall: I single demo app is totally sufficient
 sonne|work	foulwall: you just need to 'mirror' the urls we have currently in your stuff
 foulwall	sonne|work: ok...
 sonne|work	lambday: maybe better do a git clean -dfx (will erase anything not in git)
 sonne|work	recompile / install / run tests
 lambday	sonney2k: okay.. thanks... trying
 lambday	sonney2k: worked :D yippie

 hao_	Good morning everyone.
 sonne|work	hey there
 hao_	well I am an applicant of google SoC.
 hao_	And I contacted with my mentor, some days ago. He told me to make some contribution on the issues on git
 hao_	But only from the name of the issues, I am not sure which one will fit me and I can really make some help.
 hao_	And I choosed one, but found there is already some one working on it.
 hao_	So I find it may be better choose one issue after asking around.
 hao_	Would anyone here please recommend me some issues or works to work with?
@iglesiasg	hao_: Is there any of them which interests you?
 hao_	Import eliptic curve functions, but lambday is working on it.
 hao_	http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/ylyhlh/4001
 hao_	This is my proposal. May help you to know about me.
@lisitsyn	your competitor iglesiasg!
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	fight!
@iglesiasg	oops
@iglesiasg	hehe
-!- nube [~rho@49.244.50.8] has joined #shogun

@iglesiasg	not in general, but I believe that it is the case of the one we are concerned now

 hao_	Ok, I see. Thank you.
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I see you have merged a PR so fast:) Should I take now a task from HeikoS as we discussed?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yeah please ask them for some task
 foulwall	sonne|work: https://github.com/foulwall/shogun_demo, I've finished and created a repo.
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1102
@lisitsyn	what about it?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess I need a bit more info about what needs to be done:)
 sonne|work	foulwall: ok nice I will move that then to the official shogun toolbox repository. now I only need a patch that removes the demos from shogun-web
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: ask sonne|work but in general it should be something like just remove the method and resolve all errors
 sonne|work	exaclty
 foulwall	sonne|work:  ok I'll send a pr on shogun-web
 sonne|work	exaaaactly
 sonne|work	foulwall: thanks
 vgorbati	sonne|work: so I will need to find all places where this method may be used and replace it by appropriate method calls?
 sonne|work	foulwall: I think we should start to use some of shogun's data sets for illustration
 sonne|work	vgorbati: drop die this method
 sonne|work	no one should use it
 foulwall	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	vgorbati: shoot, remove!
 vgorbati	sonne|work: :)ok, understood:)
 vgorbati	I guess it won't be that hard:)
 sonne|work	foulwall: you could add support to load the data sets under toy/ from there
 sonne|work	then just plot the first 2dims of that data set
 sonne|work	and then any method could use them
 sonne|work	foulwall: like you have now 'artificial' genatore
 sonne|work	generator
 sonne|work	manually clicked
 sonne|work	now in addition data loaded
 sonne|work	foulwall: so you need some kind of re-usable component that you can display on any website for this
 foulwall	sonne|work: you mean data in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data?
 sonne|work	foulwall: I like your -1, +1 plot the most so all could just use this
 sonne|work	foulwall: yes
 foulwall	sonne|work: Ok! I'll do have a look at this repo tonight and do it tomorrow
 sonne|work	format of that is not yet standardized but will happen this gsoc :)
 sonne|work	foulwall: thanks a lot
 sonne|work	foulwall: but you got the idea yes? some say drop down list - to let the user choose to manually do input / select a data file / randomly generate data
 foulwall	sonne|work: I'll send some little patchs on the existing demo tonight. like when user move the mouse on the curve and show the coordinate
 foulwall	sonne|work: I see.
 hao_	Well. Is that possible to change the gsoc project? Because I guess the project I choosed has been filled.
@lisitsyn	hao_: there is no project with no student at all :)
 hao_	the result has almost been decided or not?
@lisitsyn	hao_: well we definitely have some list of top candidates
@lisitsyn	we have to come up with the final decision on 22th I think
 hao_	I see. kind of late to begin.

 hao_	But I still really want to try my best to make different
 hao_	any advice?
@lisitsyn	hao_: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?state=open
@lisitsyn	is there any issue you'd like to resolve?
 sonne|work	foulwall: cool!
 sonne|work	foulwall: regarding the components stuff - what I have in mind is some minimal set of 'widgets' that we can use for almost any example - we simple want DRY'ness to high
 foulwall	sonne|work: Ok, let me think how to do it tonight.
 sonne|work	hao_: or any algorithm you want to do or so
 sonne|work	foulwall: we can always discuss about this - you should not be alone on that
 foulwall	sonne|work: Ok, always online, never disappear again:)
 foulwall	sonne|work: demo wiper PR are sent, have a look
 hao_	Well I am reading the issues lists, but not sure which one to go. Actually I'd like to implement an algorithm.
@iglesiasg	lunch time in Spain :D, see you later people
-!- iglesiasg [~fjig@share-01.csc.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]

-!- van51 [~van51@178.128.60.83.dsl.dyn.forthnet.gr] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the water
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, lake mueggelsee :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ahh the mueggelsee
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the famous one
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: never heard about it
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, there is a german movie now about it 'shark hunt in lake mueggelsee'
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	shark
@lisitsyn	nice
@sonney2k	cool trash
@sonney2k	snake mueller the shark hunter
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I mean we could go for breaking the things to stuff like shogun-liblinear etc
@lisitsyn	I have no opinion on that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, there are a couple of issues
@sonney2k	lots of stuff in shogun is very much connected
@sonney2k	van51, good evening!
@sonney2k	for example features & preprocessors
@sonney2k	kernels <-> features
-!- van511 [~van51@athedsl-320452.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	kernels <-> distances
 van511	sonney2k:hey
@sonney2k	van511, good evening you too :D
 van511	haha
 van511	so what were you saying? :)
@sonney2k	van511, we are waiting for van5111
@sonney2k	van511, just hi
 van511	i'll pass the info to him, don't worry
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so I don't really know how to split this stuff out
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: me neither
@sonney2k	van511, heh
@lisitsyn	just generating ideas as usual :D
@sonney2k	so lets say we woudl want to extract kernels into a separate lib
@sonney2k	what would we do?
@lisitsyn	no no
@lisitsyn	makes no sesne
@sonney2k	why not?
@sonney2k	kernels are a submodule of shogun
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what we can extract are real algorithms
@lisitsyn	that's core
@lisitsyn	kernel,distances,features
@lisitsyn	the mighty trio
@sonney2k	we can only extract these algorithms if they are designed to be extracted
@sonney2k	consider liblinear / libsvm
@sonney2k	we cannot extract them
@sonney2k	we have things in there like ctrl+c -> stop or continue
@sonney2k	trainign time limit
@lisitsyn	yeah true
@sonney2k	own kernels
@sonney2k	or even dot features

-!- van511 is now known as van51
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, e.g. ocas was designed with that in mind
@lisitsyn	yeah same with tapkee
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, because vojtech and me were working on it together
-!- vgorbati [d4029f22@gateway/web/freenode/ip.212.2.159.34] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
@sonney2k	and vojtech wanted ocas to be around also stand-a-lone
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, about extracting kernels
@sonney2k	one could move the SG* datatypes into a separate lib that everyone then would use
@sonney2k	then a kernel could just interface with these
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I seenothing special in SG* types
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we don't want features in kernels
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	and kernels currently work with features
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, if we split out kernels
@lisitsyn	I don't really get that point
@lisitsyn	why?
@lisitsyn	why to separate them?
@sonney2k	kernels should be just kernels not kernels & features
@lisitsyn	sounds pretty painful
@sonney2k	it is all painful
@sonney2k	think about some library like say libsvm using other shogun classifiers as dynamically generated input
@sonney2k	then we cannot extract
@sonney2k	this whole module separation thing only works when you limit functionality
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes we can't extract that
@lisitsyn	yes sure
@sonney2k	maybe not bad but one has to keep that in mind
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what is most important thing I see
@sonney2k	if we would really do it I would say each directoy in shogun should be a module
@lisitsyn	vojtech maintains ocas
@lisitsyn	I maintain tapkee
@sonney2k	yeah but if there is 0 interaction between the two it doesn't help us
@sonney2k	e.g. libsvm/liblinear
@lisitsyn	yes sure
@sonney2k	we take their code
@sonney2k	modify it
@sonney2k	heavily
@lisitsyn	we have to modify their code yes
@sonney2k	but that's it
@sonney2k	we don't update and are not pushed to update
@sonney2k	and they don't care about our extensions
@sonney2k	it works fine with tapkee because you keep it up-to-date also wrt shogun interface
@lisitsyn	yes I understand
@sonney2k	but in the end it gives shogun not more - you work for tapkee and not directly on shogun
@sonney2k	if you were a non-core shogun author
@sonney2k	shogun would benefit
@sonney2k	but yes that would be the way to go
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: there are a lot of drawbacks in that for sure
@sonney2k	someone like you taking care of his own lib but who also wants to get exposure with shogun
@sonney2k	in addition ML people are like grass hoppers
@sonney2k	they move from topic to topic in no time
@lisitsyn	yeah
@sonney2k	and rarely want to maintain any code
@sonney2k	I recall the ML-OSS discussions we had in the workshops
@sonney2k	people said I give out my code sure but I don't want to support it
@sonney2k	and it is also different somehow - once an algorithm works it is finished
@sonney2k	final nothing more needed
@sonney2k	there are only new algorithms improving that algorithm
@lisitsyn	you make me feel depressed :D
@lisitsyn	usually i think there is no sense in all that stuff
@sonney2k	votjakovr, please cheer lisitsyn up hand him a vodka or something
@sonney2k	van51, wiking you too
@sonney2k	emergency
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	we lose him jaja

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I recall your last years phase when we did the SG* transition and stuff was like boom kaboom for weeks
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what do you mean?
@sonney2k	it had the same effect on you :D
@sonney2k	no I think we have lots of cool algorithms already now but we really just need to expose them better
@sonney2k	and sure there always is algoirthm X doing somethign better for whatever use case
@sonney2k	or framework Y for some other usecase
@sonney2k	we just have to find (and be satisfied with) our niche
@lisitsyn	motivation is very hard to find
@sonney2k	and to me it is currently the hardware I have access to: single machine but multicore
@lisitsyn	I feel bad with doing something that is not going to be used
@sonney2k	you always want to change the world in a day
@sonney2k	shogun is being used
@lisitsyn	hah
@lisitsyn	yes of course
@lisitsyn	I am not satisfied with regular day-to-day things
@lisitsyn	we need a breakthrough
@sonney2k	the mailinglist even has >300 subscribers
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's soviet-style I want a breakthrough  :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but actually it is the way software evolves
@lisitsyn	software dies and borns and old software takes advantage of things developed in new software
 votjakovr	Good night guys :) What's happened? Did I miss something? Now about 3 a.m. in siberia, so my mind is very slow.

@lisitsyn	damn that's cold
@sonney2k	van51, btw how are the tests going?

@sonney2k	dvalcarce, yes totally!
@sonney2k	the new contour stuff looks soooooo much better
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, ok! btw, what do you mean by using more values at the colorbar?
 dvalcarce	thx :)
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I think I have a basic upload system at bakufu, too

 van51	it's in the next room and I keep getting dc'd

@sonney2k	is it normal to have dinner twice?

@lisitsyn	I mean you are the first world war veteran you must have a good metabolistic stuff
@lisitsyn	to be in shape still
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I like to focus on bakufu, what should I do next?
 dvalcarce	(I don't have much time, my finals begin next week, but I'll try to do something)
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, anything you can do for bakufu  like file upload some minimal user management
@sonney2k	as in each user should have his own space / directory to store stuff in - the standard django-registration struff
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I know you don't have much time but in case you still have  more  you could train e.g. visualize 2 dims of the data or train some simple linear model   on it (if we focus on classification for now) etc etc
@sonney2k	but certainly your finals are more important
@sonney2k	..than whole gsoc probably
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, yeah, finals are important... but gsoc is cooler :P
 dvalcarce	i will check user management
-!- hushell [~hushell@8-92.ptpg.oregonstate.edu] has quit [Quit: leaving]
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, once you have sth I should create shogun-bakufu and we shoudl start merge things over
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, right now (https://github.com/dvalcarce/shogun-bakufu) you can upload and delete documents
 van51	sonney2k: so, the insert_element(obj, 0) when the array is empty is idd causing a seg fault
 van51	but what I can't understand is how did the octave example run smoothly then
 van51	because I used the same logic in CombinedKernel as well
@sonney2k	van51, no idea - write a unit test and fix this insert_element to work in all reasonable cases
 van51	okie
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I will move it over then
 van51	sonney2k: actually, valgind reports it as an invalid memory read
 van51	but there is no seg fault
@sonney2k	van51, lucky then
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, but not  now (too tired)
 van51	so maybe octave is more tolerant in those situations than python?
@sonney2k	van51, no we were just lucky
 van51	how?
@sonney2k	we should always check if valgrind
@sonney2k	well some corruption in not too important memory
@sonney2k	but no idea really
@sonney2k	just relax and fix it
 van51	hehe
 van51	i just find it weird!
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, ok, there is no hurry :)
@sonney2k	I gave up trying to understand all bugs
@sonney2k	alright that's it for me for today cya!
 van51	cya!
 dvalcarce	bye!
