 n4nd0	sonne|work: hey! around?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: wassup?
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@li400-235.members.linode.com] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: how do you suggest me to enable compilation with mosek in shogun?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: doing something similar to what is done for cplex?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes
 sonne|work	when mosek is found we enable the code using it
 n4nd0	ook, I will dive into the configure script then
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well more important
 sonne|work	figure out a way to detect that mosek is installed...
 sonne|work	and what the compile/linkflags are
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yes, I already found out that when I compiled some of mosek examples to try it out
 n4nd0	for the first I do whereis mosek
 n4nd0	and the flags I have to do -I platform/linux32x86/h/ -L platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek -pthread -lc -ldl -lm
 n4nd0	where platform/ is a subdirectory inside mosek installation path
 sonne|work	n4nd0: but how did you find out these flags?
 sonne|work	these might be different for other archs
 n4nd0	sonne|work: those in particular where the ones I used
 n4nd0	for another archs it looks like $mosek_path/platform/$arch_dependent_dir/h
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yeah the problem is how to figure out all these
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am finding my way so far - for the moment I am interested in make it work in my machine, once I do a PR we can make it more robust for other platforms
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well you can do the PR w/o touching configure, just make sure you ifdef your class
 sonne|work	I don't have access to mosek so I cannot test it
 sonne|work	and not test will be run for this proprietary stuff anyways
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am doing it touching the configure in order to prepare the compilation flags
 n4nd0	sonne|work: how can I do it otherwise?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: manually add it to .config-local or .config
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, I am checking, thanks!

-!- heiko2 [~heiko@host86-182-167-51.range86-182.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	thanks!
 n4nd0	harshit_: what plans do you have for the summer?
 harshit_	is there any small feature/bug or anyother thing you think i could work with ? coz otherwise i'll get disconnected with shogun world !
 harshit_	Summer !!! internship !! its mandatory for us, so I am doing it with amazon.com
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	about something to do within shogun, mmm what about the idea you had gor gsoc?
 n4nd0	for*
 harshit_	that would be too big to implement ! I need something small !
 harshit_	have to work with amazon too !
 sonne|work	harshit_: if you want something small - you could add some convenience functions to SGVector/SGMatrix
 sonne|work	like adding vectors, matrices
 sonne|work	multiplying them
 sonne|work	stuff like this
 n4nd0	sonne|work: harshit_ I was thinking too about what you said related to LDA
 harshit_	yeah that sounds simple
 sonne|work	or all the sin(x)
 sonne|work	etc
 n4nd0	do something similar to what scikits has as I did with QDA
 n4nd0	multiclass support
 harshit_	sonne|work
 sonne|work	harshit_: and more important a display() function
 sonne|work	:)
 sonne|work	harshit_: I am happy that you got some nice practical at amazon
 sonne|work	should be very exciting
 harshit_	sonne|work :Thats good idea ! nice and simple , will start with it today only !
 harshit_	sonne|work : thanks !

 n4nd0	hey blackburn
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	I've passed my software engineering exam :) awesome
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you know if there are problems with swig a function pointers?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: why do you need them?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it is the part that I will change, in CStructuredModel
 n4nd0	the argmax, the combined feature function and the delta loss
 n4nd0	they are with function pointers right now, but you told me to change them
 sonne|work	n4nd0: it certainly makes directors impossible
 sonne|work	yes
 n4nd0	all right ...
 sonne|work	classes are much prefered
 n4nd0	then I think I'll have to change it to classes now
 n4nd0	I wanted to do it once CPrimalMosek was ready
 blackburn	n4nd0: cool!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but still, just curious, is it normal that swig breaks with it?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I dont' know
 sonne|work	I thought it can somehow deal with function ptrs
 sonne|work	in the worst case %ignore them
 blackburn	I prefer no pointers in interface
 sonne|work	n4nd0: http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIG.html#SWIG_nn30
 sonne|work	it is possible
 sonne|work	but I prefer clean interfaces too
 n4nd0	yeah, I understand
 sonne|work	alright guys
 sonne|work	it is time for me to be away for some time...
 sonne|work	I will be in chat from time to time
 sonne|work	but no promises :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: enjoy your holidays!
 sonne|work	thanks

 blackburn	n4nd0: time to STL shogun!
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's go, we have to be fast!
 n4nd0	pluskid: are you in? :P
 pluskid	huuuuuuuge good news! :D
 n4nd0	where's wiking? he would support us too
 blackburn	at pakdd
 pluskid	btw: blackburn, the Vowpal Wabbit in shogun is a wrapper of the official VW, right?
 blackburn	yes but VW was updated pretty much
 blackburn	after GSoC 2011
 pluskid	hmm...
 blackburn	not a wrapper even
 blackburn	just integrated code
 pluskid	I saw there's even a specific type of features for vw
 pluskid	StreamingVwFeatures
 pluskid	is there any other online machine in shogun other than VW?
 blackburn	well larank should support that
 blackburn	but not integrated for streaming features
 pluskid	OK, I'll first try to use the current Shogun VW for conditional probability tree
 blackburn	why online?
 pluskid	because CPT is an online algorithm
 blackburn	huh
 blackburn	cool
 pluskid	it's from JL :D
 pluskid	it seems JL loves online
 pluskid	but there are some problems
 pluskid	I'm not sure
 pluskid	for example, in shogun how do you specify Labels for an online algorithm
 blackburn	in features IIRC
 pluskid	you mean embed labels in features?
 blackburn	yes, check methods of streamingfeatures
 pluskid	ah, OK, cool
 blackburn	daaaaaamn I broke caps lock
 n4nd0	:O
 n4nd0	your fingers are strong
 blackburn	tried to clean it up
 blackburn	argh
 pluskid	are you swapping Caps Lock with ESC?
 blackburn	I use some clue now :)
 blackburn	argh I'm becoming mad and can buy new notebook at some point of madness :D

 gsomix	15.67/20, passed
 gsomix	hello
 blackburn	gsomix: no more soeren - I'm your boss now :D
 gsomix	blackburn, ok.
 gsomix	blackburn, what to do first? DirectorDotFeatures?
 blackburn	no that thing can be a little difficult
 blackburn	interface needs to be changed
 blackburn	I'd suggest DirectorDistance
 gsomix	blackburn, ok. I need some rest, cu little later. :)
 blackburn	cu
