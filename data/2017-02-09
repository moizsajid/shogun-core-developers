@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@HeikoS	you know where the demo site is running
@HeikoS	ocr is still working, but I wonder how we to find the others
@wiking	fatbot
@HeikoS	ah got them
@HeikoS	wiking: check the data project lea wrote
@wiking	sawit
@wiking	cool
@wiking	i have 2 in my list
@wiking	but fuck i'm busy :<
@HeikoS	I might write one quick on the demos
@HeikoS	there is so much cool viz stuff that could be done in there

@wiking	HeikoS, btw look at this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/27f79ed566441f0a58bd541a98706f7be308bcac
@wiking	and this branch
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/config
@wiking	namely
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/a9b397fa076f1d385e710791fe0dc1999e6e69ea#diff-ff4e2dc4962dc25a1512353299992c8d
@wiking	currently windows is a bit broken on configure and i need to move that hell-hole linalg ifelse hell from the root cmakelists to src/shogun
@wiking	then it's done
@wiking	:)
@wiking	after that we have debian package everything
@wiking	shogun-*
@wiking	which is huge because we didn't update that shit since 3.x
@wiking	once config is merged
@wiking	we sholud release
@wiking	i dont know how to fix octave
@sukey	Wiki page: GSoC_2017_applications_elections edited on shogun-toolbox/shogun by lgoetz
@wiking	nor people from swig-user mailing list
@wiking	because no answer
@wiking	so the only thing we can do is to force the parallelization to =1
@wiking	in octave
@wiking	and fuck it
@wiking	agreed?

@wiking	lisitsyn, ok so
@wiking	question is that how would you intern a std::pair
 lisitsyn	yea
@wiking	in a set?
 lisitsyn	uhm?
 lisitsyn	intern like?
@wiking	intern in a sense of java's string.intern()
@wiking	because i have std::pair<string, string>
@wiking	where the frequency of std::pair is high so i'd like just store reference to it
@wiking	so yeah maybe the best is to use a set to store the pairs
@wiking	and then use references to it

@sukey	Pull Request #3608 "Clean up KNN"  synchronized by MikeLing - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608
@wiking	lisitsyn, btw i guess the best is to use for such things shared_ptr
 lisitsyn	wiking: argh sorry
 lisitsyn	distracted again
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	talking to myself actualy
@sukey	Pull Request #3608 "Clean up KNN"  synchronized by MikeLing - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608
 lisitsyn	wiking: what exactly are you trying to do?
 lisitsyn	pair is low-overhead I believe
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	but the content of it is not
@wiking	the 2 strings
 lisitsyn	well you may go for some small string optimization
@wiking	so i wanna be able to share pairs
@wiking	i.e. to not to have duplicate memory for the same pair
@wiking	because later i'll be using those pair a lot
 lisitsyn	are they pointing to the same strings?
@wiking	noup
@wiking	i mean i'm stream processing something
@wiking	so just getting a stream of strings
@wiking	and then later i structure it
@wiking	i.e. pairing them up
 lisitsyn	where do you save memory then?
@wiking	and then use pairs for indexing
@wiking	not representing multiple times
@wiking	the same pairs
@wiking	with different strings
@wiking	different in sense of memory
@wiking	and not content
@wiking	so i have documents
@wiking	like 100k
 lisitsyn	what are k and v
@wiking	and each document have 1000+ string paris
@wiking	*pairs
 lisitsyn	so some values are the same?
 lisitsyn	or keys?
@wiking	but the overlap of those pairs among documents are high
@wiking	k = pair<string, string> v = some other stats
 lisitsyn	oh so the same pairs
@wiking	yeah but
@wiking	when i make_pair
@wiking	i dont have like in jvm string.intern()
 lisitsyn	doesn't sound like a big improvement?
@wiking	and then i know that they are using the same memory for representing the same string
@wiking	so think about 50%+ overlap of pairs
@wiking	string.lenght() = 10
 lisitsyn	ah so you want to intern your strings?
@wiking	so that is per pair 20 bytes right?
@wiking	so 1000*100k*20 = 20M * 100M = 2000M = 2G
@wiking	saving is essentially 1g
@wiking	no?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	if the overlap is ~50%
 lisitsyn	ok you may have some string interning machine
 lisitsyn	that could intern strings that appear often
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	i mean i just thought to have a set<shared_ptr<pair<string, string>> storage;
 lisitsyn	if it is not long-running
 lisitsyn	you may go with something simpler
 lisitsyn	pair<int, int>
@wiking	boost::flyweight< std::string > seems to be exactly what you're looking for.
@wiking	:P
 lisitsyn	and do lifting in your machine
 lisitsyn	ah
@wiking	^ stack overflow
 lisitsyn	yeah that's flyweight pattern
 lisitsyn	no idea how it works tho
@wiking	https://github.com/mnmlstc/flyweight
@wiking	so yeah maybe i should just include such a lib
@wiking	and fuck it
@wiking	:)
@wiking	easier than maintaining that set
@wiking	:P
@wiking	here some new depechemode in exchange
@wiking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpuaPfOuxB0
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh I bought tickets already
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	this summer they're in moscow
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	cool
@wiking	good
@wiking	for you
@wiking	there's nothign good around me
@wiking	except kpop and jpop that i dont listen to
 lisitsyn	ah yeah
 lisitsyn	all these asian songs
@wiking	:>
@wiking	pineapple
 lisitsyn	pen pineapple apple pay
 lisitsyn	:D
