@HeikoS	wiking: I just referenced you to one
@HeikoS	wiking: would be cool to maintain these like the unit tests
@HeikoS	wiking: so that we can at any point check how fast things are, etc. Helps discussions when we forgot why we decided things
@HeikoS	wiking: and how are things anyway?
@HeikoS	wiking: want to come to London in spring too?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	but wait
 wiking	so fuck
 wiking	why do we do this again
 wiking	that we roll our own benchmark
 wiking	http://www.mlpack.org/benchmark.html
 wiking	https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml
 wiking	let's try to use something that then we can objectively compare
 wiking	to other stuff out there
@HeikoS	wiking: sure
@HeikoS	wiking: for comparing high level that is better
@HeikoS	wiking: but we have internal design decisions
@HeikoS	like how we do certain operations
 wiking	yeah i know that
@HeikoS	this is just to measure the speed of matrix products etc
 wiking	but i really think
 wiking	that having first the highline thing
 wiking	is better
@HeikoS	how much to gain with GPU over CPU etc
 wiking	than fucking around with speed of matrix
@HeikoS	highline thing?
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	agreed
 wiking	first lets see why our kmeans sucks
@HeikoS	wiking: well lambday wrote the thing already
 wiking	let see why we are slow in the algo level
 wiking	i know
@HeikoS	would be stupid to loose it
 wiking	i just dont see why is it good :D
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah totally right you are
 wiking	because essentialy
 wiking	you can do this
 wiking	with a good profiler
 wiking	like perf
 wiking	so no need for low level shit
 wiking	that's my 2 cents
@HeikoS	wiking: ok then
 wiking	we need high level understanding
 wiking	first
 wiking	have it automated
 wiking	and have it for all the methods
@HeikoS	wiking: how would you go ahead
 wiking	and actually on tengible amount of data
 wiking	well either of those
 wiking	could be a good starter
 wiking	because they already have integration points
@HeikoS	its actually on my list to do such a thing, but dont know how: check all algorithm implementations and make sure they are fast
 wiking	with other libs
@HeikoS	just going through mlpacks benchmarks you think?
 wiking	that's why it's better to use something that is out there
 wiking	yeah that could be one option
 wiking	or the other... szilard
 wiking	i mean that shit
 wiking	if we cannot beat those
 wiking	libraries
@HeikoS	wiking: +1
 wiking	we are definitely doing something very wrong
 wiking	all of them are like java, python r based shit
@HeikoS	wiking: we could write a priority list of algorithms where we want to be fast
 wiking	so you can imagine the performance
 wiking	so if we are doing our job right
@HeikoS	wiking: its quite hard to beat well written python code in C to be honest and I assume thats the same for other languages
 wiking	then we could at least beat those algos
 wiking	by a factor of 10
@HeikoS	wiking: any systematic idea?
 wiking	doh?
@HeikoS	to approach that?
 wiking	python
 wiking	where the fucntion call
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean ML code
 wiking	is a significant overhead? :D
 wiking	come on... python itself is a shit
@HeikoS	where there are few function calls, mostly liunalg
 wiking	when it's about performance
 wiking	you have to use C extension in python
 wiking	do have performance
 wiking	but then the memory is always pumped up
 wiking	because it's python
@HeikoS	agreed
@HeikoS	wiking: that would be a fun thing to work on together at a code sprint
 wiking	yeah ah
 wiking	so i wanted to reply
 wiking	i'm gonna be in europe
@HeikoS	when?
 wiking	between march and end of may
 wiking	so any time between that time
 wiking	would be optimal for me
 wiking	to join the sprint
 wiking	i'm gonna be in wien
 wiking	so i can jump over to london anytime
@HeikoS	hey thats great
@HeikoS	so lambday is in london from 01.03 to 31.05 at least
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  joins hopefully in march
@HeikoS	if you come, we are 4
 wiking	ok just tell me the days
 wiking	and i'm there
@HeikoS	I talked to s?ren who is already interested
 wiking	but fuck london? :)

 wiking	cant we find a more expensive place? :D
 wiking	or we rent a whole flat
 wiking	for the group?
 wiking	a pint of beer is soooo overpriced :)
 wiking	and the coffee too
 wiking	:)

 HeikoS1	wiking: I think yes
 HeikoS1	will sort that out when I am back
 HeikoS1	gatsby is in new building with lots of free space so might easily work
 HeikoS1	can share a flat from airbnb
 wiking	k
 wiking	let ssee
 HeikoS1	or if it is just the two of you, you might be able to fit in my space
 wiking	still
 wiking	pint and coffee is overpriced :D
 HeikoS1	can use gatsby coffee machine
 HeikoS1	new brewing equipment unfortunately ;)

 wiking	:D
 HeikoS1	wiking: what about creating a list with algorithms that are slow in Shogun? in Wiki
 HeikoS1	I guess SVM is fine
 HeikoS1	mostly all the GSoC stuff will be slow
 HeikoS1	because people just write it and stop once it works, never tune things
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	let's see what these benchmarking thigns
 wiking	are doing
 wiking	what are the algos
 wiking	and then add some of ours
 wiking	and see wtf
 wiking	i need to wrap up my thesis correction
 wiking	this month
 wiking	so i'm a bit still busy
 wiking	but startin jan
 wiking	i'll jump in as much as i can
 wiking	(just defended the thesis yesterday night :P))
 wiking	\o/
 HeikoS1	really
 HeikoS1	congrats!!
 HeikoS1	didnt know
 HeikoS1	yeah we can do this in spring then
 HeikoS1	good topic for the sprint
 wiking	:>
 HeikoS1	as well as sergeys plugins
 wiking	indeed
 HeikoS1	and more code dropping
 HeikoS1	I like it that the last patch deleted 1.5k lines from the base class!
 wiking	:D
 wiking	i'll look into this month
 wiking	about having parsers
 HeikoS1	and we finally disabled this stupid time consiming integration tests
 wiking	in our stuff
 HeikoS1	need to unit test typemaps now instead though
 HeikoS1	ah cool
 HeikoS1	yea
 wiking	but i wanna supporrt
 HeikoS1	would be good to be able to load data I guess ;)
 wiking	big files
 wiking	:D
 wiking	that's why libarchive
 HeikoS1	yes exactly
 HeikoS1	I see that
 wiking	so that you can directly read whatever.csv.gz
 HeikoS1	just need to make sure we dont stop there but also actiually implement a csv reader
 HeikoS1	or not implement
 HeikoS1	integrate
 HeikoS1	such things should not be in shogun
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	or at least
 HeikoS1	as well as all the old data structures
 wiking	modulerized out
 HeikoS1	should go
 wiking	with sergey's attempt
 HeikoS1	to libraries that are used
 HeikoS1	serialisation also
 HeikoS1	the code is so bad
 wiking	mmm serialization is still good
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	come on
 wiking	it's not that bad
 wiking	it's abstracted nicely
 HeikoS1	I think it is
 wiking	the shit i see nowadays
 HeikoS1	haha
 wiking	this code in shogun
 HeikoS1	well I would prefer a nice linb
 wiking	is amazing
 wiking	linb?
 HeikoS1	lib
 HeikoS1	library
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	well
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn wants to just have a map of parameters
 HeikoS1	that is easy to store
 wiking	some things we cnanot afford
 HeikoS1	and then you have serialisation
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	map
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	dont get me started on that :D
 HeikoS1	haha
 wiking	but yeah at least hashmap is not that expensive in c++
 wiking	like in jvm
 wiking	:>
 HeikoS1	hehe
 wiking	but o
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i looked into a nice serialization stuff
 wiking	but i truely believe
 HeikoS1	which one?
 wiking	that once we have the modularized system
 wiking	then we wouldnt care so much
 wiking	having our own serialization
 wiking	cerela
 wiking	cereal
 wiking	http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/
 HeikoS1	wiking: I partly agree
 HeikoS1	sure then such codes dont hurt us so much
 HeikoS1	but the point is that we are a ML library
 wiking	yeah sure i understand
 HeikoS1	and we should keep our code focussed on that
 wiking	but as said
 wiking	if it's just a module
 wiking	we can leave it there haning
 HeikoS1	cerial sounds good!
 wiking	hanging
 wiking	and you can right away switch to another module/lib
 wiking	if you want
 HeikoS1	serialisation is needed though
 HeikoS1	ah yes
 HeikoS1	replace
 HeikoS1	and then just get rid of old
 HeikoS1	I agree
 HeikoS1	good stuff
 HeikoS1	hey how do you want to fix that csharp build?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i was already digging in that
 HeikoS1	one way is to remove the two methods with the same signature
 wiking	yeah no
 wiking	:)
 wiking	i'll try the better way
 wiking	the thing is that this all comes from the typemap
 wiking	definitions
 wiking	and that's why there's suddenlty 2 params with the same name
 wiking	i just wanna change that
 HeikoS1	wiking: as rename the parameters?
 wiking	never really managed to have the full 2 days
 wiking	to fix it
 wiking	yeah
 HeikoS1	I want to release this week if possible
 HeikoS1	got some momentum at the moment, and a bit of time
 HeikoS1	sergey also helps
 wiking	tyis weeek?!1?!
 wiking	are you crazy? :D)
 wiking	i thought we are doing release in jan
 wiking	that's what lisitsyn told me the last time
 HeikoS1	when we met here, we kind of agreed to do now
 HeikoS1	and then another one
 HeikoS1	more releases needed
 HeikoS1	minor releases
 HeikoS1	ppl think the project is dead
 wiking	yeah i get that
 wiking	ok then do now a release without a fix for c#
 wiking	i mean if you use old mono
 wiking	it'll work
 wiking	:D
 HeikoS1	ok
 HeikoS1	but its that patch that broke it
 HeikoS1	was working before
 HeikoS1	I just dont get what exactly breaks it, everything is hidden from swig
 wiking	nono
 wiking	c# hasn't worked
 wiking	with mono 3.x
 wiking	since ever
 wiking	:D
 wiking	maybe on travis it was working
 wiking	since it's 12.04 ubuntu
 HeikoS1	yes
 HeikoS1	check before and after
 HeikoS1	the PR is sent

@besser82	sanuj, I see...  possibly the ubuntu ppa will work on that one too
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: compile problems?
@besser82	sanuj, was asking, because there are distros with redy2go packages of shogun

@HeikoS	sanuj: you can also look at using the new Shogun linalg interface to do NNs
@HeikoS	in particular for convolution operations
@HeikoS	since these things might soon run on GPU
 sanuj	HeikoS: i was about to ask
 sanuj	do you guys plan to have GPU support
@HeikoS	we do
@HeikoS	check Convolve.h
 sanuj	cuda cudnn or something like that
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	and Convolve_unittest.cc
@HeikoS	how to use them
@HeikoS	these things already run on GPU
@HeikoS	sanuj: but if you can come up with a list of operations that are needed for the NNs let us know
@HeikoS	AFAIK, the NN code is also single-core
@HeikoS	might be good to think about multicore
 sanuj	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	sanuj: but convolution is already useful I uess ;)
 sanuj	HeikoS: indeed
@HeikoS	sanuj: did you ever edit some of the NN code in Shogun?
@HeikoS	Sorry I have  a bad memory
 sanuj	i solved some todo tasks that sergey listed in the deep learning project
 sanuj	and before that
 sanuj	did some clean up and linalg stuff
 sanuj	docs in the beginning to get started with the contributing process
 sanuj	it was fun ;)
@HeikoS	sanuj: sounds good
@HeikoS	if you already touched linalg
@HeikoS	Another important thing we need currently: linear solves in lingalg
@HeikoS	but if you use the convolution interface in the exisitng NN code, that would be super helpful already
 sanuj	HeikoS: i can look into it
 sanuj	winter breaks here
@HeikoS	sanuj: ha!
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: let me know if you need help with anything
@HeikoS	sanuj: we really appreciate people doing things for Shogun
@HeikoS	sanuj: so let's make sure you dont get stuck
 sanuj	HeikoS: yes
 sanuj	shall i start by the convolution part
 sanuj	i'll have to see the code first
@HeikoS	sanuj: yes, have a look at that
@HeikoS	sanuj: if you can systematically replace all the convolution code in the NNs by the linalg interface calls, that is a huge step forward
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool
 sanuj	there are 2 backend for conv
 sanuj	eigen3 and viennacl
 sanuj	HeikoS: I need to go now
 sanuj	will look into it tomorrow and get back to you
@HeikoS	sanuj: backend can be chosen at compile time
@HeikoS	sanuj: that is the idea
@HeikoS	that algorithm is *independent* of backend
@HeikoS	so one can choose
@HeikoS	without touching
@HeikoS	see you later
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah i remember
 sanuj	bye

@HeikoS	we sill have loads of them

 yorkerlin	hopefully, I can fix most of them tonight
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: make sure to fix them using regular expressions

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  jo
 lisitsyn	just got home
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I can share .vimrc with you so you can check
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool!
 lisitsyn	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2fe55e42a2b60fffd966
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  any idea how to replace license consistently in all files?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	automatically
 lisitsyn	uhmm
 lisitsyn	sed..
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you know how to do that?
@HeikoS	I mean remive all GPL
@HeikoS	but extract names
@HeikoS	and replace by BSD with those names
@HeikoS	OR
@HeikoS	we change even more
@HeikoS	saying that we have Authors file
@HeikoS	and dont distringuish individual files anymore
@HeikoS	rather use git history
@HeikoS	git blame
@HeikoS	thoughts?
@HeikoS	would be easier
@HeikoS	if all the headers would just be BSD license
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I actually think we don't need full license
 lisitsyn	in the file
@HeikoS	or even remove license
@HeikoS	and have only one file
@HeikoS	and it is "unless otherwise stated"
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we can just replace
 lisitsyn	argh irc crap
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: shall we do that before the release?
 lisitsyn	     /** ... */
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	ah yes
 lisitsyn	with /** This file is distributed by BSD 2-clause license. See LICENSE for more details */
@HeikoS	or next release better
@HeikoS	good
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	next release
@HeikoS	and no more authors in the files
 lisitsyn	well it makes sense to have some
 lisitsyn	actually people are interested in seeing their names
 lisitsyn	so I'd actually do it like
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	    /** This file is distributed by BSD 2-clause license. See LICENSE for more details */
 lisitsyn	oops
@HeikoS	how to keep that?
 lisitsyn	  /** This file is distributed by BSD 2-clause license. See LICENSE for more details
@HeikoS	I mean how to extract names
 lisitsyn	@authors: [git blame thing]
 lisitsyn	 */
 lisitsyn	just anybody touched the file
 lisitsyn	ordered by number of lines changed
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	easy to do
 lisitsyn	just assign it to me
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can you add and assign yourself?
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	number of lines touced?
@HeikoS	no good idea
@HeikoS	since it gets outdated
@HeikoS	just if ever touched better?
 lisitsyn	no I mean the order

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@HeikoS	yeah go for that!
@HeikoS	good point
@HeikoS	We need to be a bit careful about some files
@HeikoS	but will do that when its time
@HeikoS	after release
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we have to check the full diff afterwise though
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
