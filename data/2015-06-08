@besser82	HeikoS, hey =)
@HeikoS	besser82: hey man!
@HeikoS	how are things? :)
@besser82	depends on POV...  ;(
@besser82	and yourself
@besser82	?
@besser82	caught NIPS deadline?

@besser82	HeikoS, ^
 guiniol	Hello all. I'm trying to learn how to use shogun, but I can't get the examples to work
 guiniol	specifically, I'm using python3 and trying the hmm example
 guiniol	the modular one gives me a segfault, and the static one doesn't find the module 'sg' to import (which I haven't found either)
 guiniol	could anyone give me some pointers?
@HeikoS	guiniol: hi there
@HeikoS	besser82: NIPS is submitted (phew!)
@HeikoS	besser82: now catching up with all the stuff I left for the weeks ;)
@HeikoS	guiniol: use python modular, not static
@HeikoS	do the other examples work?
 guiniol	HeikoS: trying out a few now
 guiniol	I got 2 segafaults and 2 eigen3 missing
 guiniol	but I didn't even read them, just tried to execute them
 guiniol	BTW, this is on the 4.0.0 release
@HeikoS	guiniol: this can be due to many reasons
@HeikoS	guiniol: did you compile from source?
 guiniol	maybe there's a problem with my install
@HeikoS	guiniol: if so, try the latest versionn, if you still get an error, post it on github issues
 guiniol	HeikoS: will do
@HeikoS	segfaults usually happen when your python version used to compile shogun are different to those used to run it
@HeikoS	guiniol: so double check your python setup
 guiniol	I installed it from the AUR (archlinux) which should just be compiled from source
 guiniol	I'll check

 CaBa	are the installation instructions on the website outdated? the docs look like autotools, but there is not configure script in the tarball...
 guiniol	HeikoS: so, I compiled from the source and both the 4.0.0 release and master give me a segfault. Are there specific versions of some libraries that are required?
 CaBa	seems to be cmake now... okay

 CaBa	hm. i built shogun with python bindings from source, unfortunately it segfaults when the library is invoked..
 CaBa	(mac os 10.9)
 CaBa	any known issues there?
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	ooooh
@wiking	that is a nice story
@wiking	ok so you have like brew or macports?
 guiniol	CaBa: not on macosx, but I get a segfault on most python examples, the other ones I get an "eigen3 missing" error
 CaBa	wiking: i built from the source tarball, also tried brew
@wiking	ok do this
@wiking	rm -rf build
@wiking	and redo the whole, mkdir build && cd  build && cmake ... stuff
@wiking	and send the cmake output via pastebin
 CaBa	wiking: https://photomics.org/ucah7aS8_cmakeout.txt
@wiking	mmm this is interesting
 CaBa	in what respect?
@wiking	that the reason for the segfault is something else :(
@wiking	not the thing i thought it is
 CaBa	is there a on-liner to invoce the library somehow? so i dont have to try with an example script all the time...
 CaBa	just to keep my testbed minimal
 CaBa	*oneliner
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	when does it segfault btw?
@wiking	already at the import of modshogun?
@wiking	or when u try an operation?
 CaBa	nope
 CaBa	that works
 CaBa	running classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.py is what i tried next
 CaBa	that segfaulted
@wiking	btw
@wiking	if you are in build
@wiking	you could type
@wiking	ctest -R python*
 guiniol	CaBa: wiking I seem to have exactly the same problem, with 4.0.0 and master installed from source, and the 3.2.0 version packaged in Debian
 CaBa	wiking: just a sec. have to build again first
 CaBa	maybe i should try a gcc build, too...
 CaBa	why is there an openmp dependency? should i use gcc for parallelization?
@wiking	nono
@wiking	it's ok
 CaBa	wiking: hm. nothing in the build directory matches 'python*'
 CaBa	wiking: actually i cant find anything ctest-ish anywhere
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=RQUCEiQd <- this works
 guiniol	wiking: is there some kind of dependency or something that we could be missing? or are the examples outdated? from the github repo, it seems all the examples are from 2 years ago
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=1Ag68Mj8 <- this doesn't
 CaBa	wiking: the segfault occurs at the perceptron.apply() invokation
 CaBa	not even sure about that...

@HeikoS	guiniol: hi
@HeikoS	try the development version
@HeikoS	and check the python library that CMake detects and compare it to the one that is in your PYTHONPATH when you execute Shogun
 guiniol	HeikoS: what do you mean by the dev version? I tried with master
@HeikoS	try using the develop branch
@HeikoS	but the problem is not the version
@HeikoS	I guess it is the Python
@HeikoS	unless you are on ma
@HeikoS	mac
@HeikoS	then, try the develop as we recently fixed a problem in osx
 guiniol	not on mac ( CaBa is though, might want to take a look), but I'll try the develop branch
 guiniol	HeikoS: how do I see what version of python cmake is seeing?
 guiniol	my default version is 3.4 I think
@HeikoS	guiniol: cat CMakeCache.txt | grep ython
@HeikoS	and then see whats in your environment
 CaBa	git/develop doesn't even build on my mac, at least not with clang. will try gcc-5.1
@HeikoS	python3 on mac was segaulting until a while ago
@HeikoS	CaBa: yes outdated, check the readmes instead
 guiniol	HeikoS: the version matches my default version: 3.4 I'
 guiniol	m on archlinux, so usually their python is rather vanilla
 CaBa	HeikoS: hm? yes outdated?
@HeikoS	CaBa: the docs on the website
@wiking	CaBa: sorry was away
@HeikoS	guiniol: that is weird
@HeikoS	guiniol: could you post your exact system specs and the error on github issues?
@HeikoS	wiking: hexy there!
@wiking	CaBa: ok the problem is actually
 guiniol	HeikoS: I'm installing all the optional packages that cmake didn't find to see if that helps
@wiking	that you are mixing python libraries
 guiniol	HeikoS: will do, but probably tomorrow
@wiking	HeikoS: alohaaa!
 CaBa	wiking: that means?
@HeikoS	wiking: hows life?
@HeikoS	guiniol: no that is not the problem
@HeikoS	guiniol: ususally there are config problems if this happens,
@HeikoS	guiniol: especially on linux
@HeikoS	wiking: any other reason python examples segfault=?
@wiking	HeikoS: back to europe for couple of weeks
@wiking	CaBa: means that you have your system python library and that's what you are using for compiling the shogun modulare interface
@wiking	ok so what's in here
@wiking	PYTHONPATH=~/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
@wiking	?
@wiking	and here DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib
 CaBa	wiking: ~/local is the prefix i gave cmake as an install target
 CaBa	wiking: ~/local was created right before the build / install
 CaBa	wiking: i.e. it only contains what 'make install' put there
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, where are you based right now?
@wiking	HeikoS: temp or perm?
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	both? :)
@wiking	HeikoS: i'm at home atm, but flying back to singapore in 2 weeks
@wiking	home = serbia,hungary :)
 CaBa	wiking: don't really see where i'm mixing anything here yet...
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, how come?
@HeikoS	when are you visiting me in London? :D
@wiking	CaBa: doh, so only shogun stuff is there, right?
@wiking	HeikoS: eheheh god knows
@wiking	HeikoS: well now it's holidays etc
@wiking	came home to see the family
 CaBa	wiking: yep
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=et4svkgY
@wiking	dman
@wiking	i'll have to test this myself then
@wiking	had some segfaults
@wiking	before
 CaBa	wiking: in principle install targets other than /usr/local are supported, right? i really want to avoid messing up my /usr/local... ;)
@wiking	yes of course :>
@wiking	the segfault previously we've seen was because
@wiking	cmake used the system's python interpreter but macport's headers/library
@wiking	i.e. different python was used
@wiking	but in your case you consistently use the system's python itsel
@wiking	*itself
 CaBa	i have a homebrew python (2.7.10), too, but that's not what i use
 CaBa	if i use that one, i get the segfault already on 'import modshogun' ;)
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	how did u make that to be used?
@wiking	what cmake parameter have u used to do that?
 CaBa	to do what?
 CaBa	cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local
 CaBa	this is my cmake call
@wiking	ok and for using homebrew's python?
 CaBa	oh I meant when i use *that* build with brews python
 CaBa	i.e.
 CaBa	DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib/ PYTHONPATH=~/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/  /usr/local/bin/python
@wiking	heheh
@wiking	try to use this
@wiking	just a sec
@wiking	-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local
@wiking	and paste the cmake output
 CaBa	as long as you don't make me 'make install'... ;)
@wiking	prefix path is not install path
 CaBa	ah, right
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=aYfBfKuf
@wiking	-- Could NOT find CCache (missing:  CCACHE)
@wiking	install ccache
 CaBa	oops
@wiking	will save you a lot of time in the future ;)
 CaBa	thats with gcc-5 anyway
@wiking	uuuuu
@wiking	dont do this
@wiking	-- The C compiler identification is AppleClang 6.0.0.6000057
@wiking	-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 5.1.0
@wiking	:<
@wiking	as this'll be hardcore segfault :)
@wiking	make it use the same compiler
@wiking	whether it is gnu or clang
@wiking	i dont care
@wiking	but be consistent
 CaBa	yeah was just a try... and i didn't expect any C code ;)
@wiking	ther eis
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=bNKQ5ZWt
 CaBa	wiking: there you go. clang all the way and ccache for more fun :P
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	find /usr/local -name 'libpython*dylib'
 CaBa	wiking: brew doesn't link those in order not to collid with systems python
@wiking	as for some reason:
@wiking	-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib (found version "2.7.5")
 CaBa	$ find /usr/local -name 'libpython*dylib'
 CaBa	/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.10/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
 CaBa	/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.10/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.dylib
 CaBa	/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
 CaBa	/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/config/libpython2.7.dylib
@wiking	mmm interesting :S
 CaBa	wiking: i guess building against the system python stuff should be preferred...
@wiking	mmm yeah
@wiking	i was just wondering what would it do with brew...?
@wiking	i'm always using macport's python though :)
 CaBa	wiking: well brews shogun doesnt work, too, fails also already on import
 CaBa	wiking: so maybe the formula just doesn't work
 CaBa	wiking: i also don't see any PREFIX magic in the formula
 CaBa	wiking: it does have a dependency on the brew python though, i guess they intend to build against that
@wiking	just testing the HEAD of develop now with macports first :)

 CaBa	bioinformatics, immunogenetics in particular
@wiking	nice
@wiking	what brought u to shogun?
@wiking	what algo u wanna test?
 CaBa	well i want to play around with machine learning a little, string kernels in particular. haven't done anything in that area yet
 CaBa	have to go. thanks for the support, i'll write that ticket :)
@wiking	thnx
@HeikoS	wiking: ah
@HeikoS	wiking: you know we set it up
