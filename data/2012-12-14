 erin_	Hi all, I very much appreciate your work in making such a great toolbox and I am looking forward to work and experiment on it. But I am trying to compile shogun in my matlab and i am very much stuck and troubled. I particularly followed the steps written in the installation page
 erin_	./configure --interfaces=matlab_static make make install
 erin_	But I never even reached the 'make' part
 erin_	particularly it had an error
 erin_	Checking for Matlab developer support (-lmx -lmex -lmat) ... no
 erin_	cc -I. -I..  -fPIC -march=pentium3 -mtune=pentium3 -pthread ./configure-10124-504.c -o ./configure-7655-504.o  -mno-cygwin -DMATLAB_MEX_FILE -I/MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab.exe/extern/include -shared -mno-cygwin -Wl,--version-script,mexFunction.map -Wl,--rpath-link,/MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab.exe/extern/lib/win32 -L/MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab.exe/bin/win32 -lmx -lmex -lmat -lm -pthread -lz -lbz2
 erin_	I have searched some similar problems regarding this particularly  as to why it directs to this type of address: MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab.exe/bin/win32
 erin_	so my query is  Is it compatible to compile shogun for a win64 and matlab 2011 64-bit?
 wiking	erin_: still here?
 erin_	yes
 wiking	ok so u r using windows right?
 erin_	yes i am
 wiking	can u compile shogun without matlab_modular?
 wiking	or matlab_static
 wiking	so i mean without matlab interface?
 wiking	because i think you'll need cygwin to compile shogun for windows
 erin_	i am using cygwin... it was succesful but not for the matlab_static
 erin_	 libshogun and the following interfaces: cmdline_static python_static
 wiking	aha
 wiking	yeah use python_module if possilb
 wiking	and cygwin compiled it for 64 bits?
 erin_	yes
 wiking	aha
 wiking	ok then there's a problem with the configure script
 erin_	so it is not possible for matlab? i dont know how to use python -_-
 wiking	i think it should be possible
 wiking	just needs some fixing
 wiking	as it hasn't been prepared to be used with 64 bits matlab
 wiking	but that doesn't mean that it's not possible
 erin_	i see... but for the 32-bit it should work right?
 wiking	do you have a directory /MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab.exe/bin/win64 ?
 wiking	or soemthing like that?
 erin_	i don't.. that is quite confusing actually..
 wiking	well it looks like for me that it should work for 32 bits... but as said i never tried it myself before...
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	so i guess you have /MATLAB/R2011b/bin right?
 erin_	yup!
 wiking	okey
 wiking	and what do you have in that directory?
 wiking	can u please copy-paste it here?
 erin_	insttype.ini  lcdata.xml  lcdata.xsd  lcdata_utf8.xml  license.txt  m3iregistry  matlab.bat  matlab.exe  mex.bat  mex.pl  mexext.bat  mexsetup.pm  mexutils.pm  registry  util  wi
 wiking	mmm that's interesting
 erin_	win64
 wiking	ah so u have there win64
 wiking	right
 wiking	?
 erin_	yup! it has a win64 folder
 wiking	great
 wiking	then we just need to fix a little bit
 wiking	and it might even work ;)
 wiking	how does your ./configure line looks like now?
 wiking	how do you call it?
 erin_	same as that of the installation page
 erin_	./configure --interfaces=matlab_static
 wiking	ok so there's actually seems like there's 2 problems
 wiking	1 how the matlab_dir is detected
 wiking	2) that it tries to use win32 instead win64
 wiking	the former we can fix quite fast
 erin_	that's great! meanwhile.. ill be trying it on win32 and update you
 wiking	ok

 erin_	wow i appreciate your prompt response on the matter... :)
 wiking	no worries
 wiking	hope that we can figure it out for you
 wiking	my concern here rather the first problem
 wiking	the detection of the path for matlab
 erin_	ok ill be back next time.. ill go first to my sort-of meeting... thanks again!

 wiking	lol ok
 wiking	i was just about to ask u to do some stuff... ;)
 wiking	i guess later

 nona642	Hi everyone
 nona642	anybody works with weighted degree position string kernel before?
 sonne|work	nona642: lets say yes ;)
 Guest71666	I have problems with setting shift_len
 Guest71666	I am sing R static and I assume if the degree is for example 20 shift_len has to be a vector of length 20
 sonne|work	could you be a bit more specific
* sonne|work lunch time

 erin_	@wiking and others as well, I tried installing shogun in win32  for matlab and still produce the same error
 erin_	Checking for Matlab developer support (-lmx -lmex -lmat) ... no  Error: could not find matlab developer files (e.g. mex.h)  Check configure.log if you do not understand why it failed.

 erin_	apparently it also search at the wrong directory: Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/bin/matlab.exe/bin/win32

 erin_	wiking: i started to fix the configure file but still didn't work
 erin_	first, i change mat matlab dir to a direct path
 erin_	second, i changed matlab developer supper to libmx libmex and libmat....now  this is the current look:
 erin_	cc -I. -I..   -fPIC -march=native -mtune=native -pthread ./configure-23895-6208.c -o ./configure-5220-6208.o  -mno-cygwin -DMATLAB_MEX_FILE -I/cygdrive/c/Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/include -shared -mno-cygwin -Wl,--version-script,mexFunction.map -Wl,--rpath-link,/cygdrive/c/Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/lib/win32 -L/cygdrive/c/Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/bin/win32 -libmx -libmex -libmat -lm -pthread -lhdf5 -llapack -lblas 
 erin_	has been removed; use a mingw-targeted cross-compiler.
 wiking	erin_: yeah because you still need to change to win64... if u r trying to compile it for 64bit
 erin_	i am working it on the win32 now
 erin_	so it should be right :s
 wiking	ah
 wiking	then yeah
 wiking	what is the error on this
 erin_	same, Checking for Matlab developer support (-libmx -libmex -libmat) ... no  Error: could not find matlab developer files (e.g. mex.h)
 erin_	this is now the current command

 wiking	mmm
 wiking	erin_: extern/include/mex.h
 wiking	don't u have this?
 wiking	/cygdrive/c/Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/include/mex.h
 wiking	there should be something like this
 wiking	but i thiiiink your problem is that the path is not escaped
 wiking	/cygdrive/c/Program Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/include should be
 wiking	/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/include/mex.h
 wiking	i mean: /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/MATLAB/R2010a/extern/include
 erin_	i do have it.. oh right! ill try now
 erin_	still same.. i'm also bothered with this error
 erin_	cc: The -mno-cygwin flag has been removed; use a mingw-targeted cross-compiler.

 erin_	wiking, you are right about the path.. well, one of the problems.. basically I lowered the compiler version so the -mno-cygwin is not there anymore.. but now it has these
