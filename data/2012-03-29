 puffin444	hello
 trailblazer	hello are any moderators online ?
 trailblazer	i have a question about the GSOC 12
 puffin444	hi trailblazer I don't know if there are moderators here
 puffin444	I'm a student too
 trailblazer	are u applying for GSOC too ?
 puffin444	I'll see if I can put together an application
 puffin444	so yes
 trailblazer	yea i was going through it ,it says  under one section ---"Make yourself familiar with the github interface and start to interact with us by sending a (small) patch via a github pull request."
 trailblazer	i am not really sure how can i contributr to it
 trailblazer	any ideas??
 puffin444	There are instructions how to do that on Github. You make an account on github and make your own personal fork.
 trailblazer	i mean i have a girhub set up and everything
 trailblazer	its this part i am wondering  about  ---"start to interact with us by sending a (small) patch via a github pull request."
 puffin444	Oh yeah material for a patch. Good question. I am actually submitting some initial code for my proposed project.
 trailblazer	do we need to work on some of their bugs or something
 puffin444	Do you have a specific project in mind?
 trailblazer	yep
 trailblazer	i think i am gonna for ---Implement multitask and domain adaptation algorithms
 puffin444	So one mentor told me any bug fix, even if it was unrelated to the proposed project would be helpful
 trailblazer	i see
 puffin444	You could also talk to the proposed mentor and ask if there is anything initially you could do.
 puffin444	This is what I did.
 trailblazer	that seems a good idea
 puffin444	What I don't know is when to do the actual pull request. I have some questions about how my code fits into the API
 puffin444	I don't know if I should submit the pull request right away and ask then, or ask on IRC/mailing lists and then submit the PR after talking with them
 trailblazer	i see , i guess mentors can better answer that question
 puffin444	I just don't want to bother them with half-baked additions
 trailblazer	so what are you studying?
 puffin444	CS right now, probably at Robotics in the fall
 puffin444	how about you?
 trailblazer	same here bachelors in CS
 trailblazer	i did ML course by stanford thats what got me hooked up in this area
 puffin444	That's awesome!
 puffin444	Well goodluck on your application!

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi! are you around?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have a doubt ... it turns out that there is an object, CLabels* created in the method classify_one_vs_one
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the method returns that object, so it is not responsible of freeing it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: however this method also does SG_REF(labels)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: and if I use that method from another file, I am trying right now with an example, and also do SG_REF(labels)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: then there is a memory leak
 n4nd0	sonney2k: if I remove the SG_REF from the example then it disappear
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but it seems to me more reasonable that it is the library the one that shouldn't do SG_REF because it is not responsible of freeing it, what do you think?
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey!
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please describe this problem a little more?
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	blackburn: I was going to ask you about it :)
 blackburn	if I got you right
 blackburn	it should work in the following way
 blackburn	any method returning new object should REF it before
 blackburn	then you don't need to REF this object cause it has 1 ref already
 blackburn	all you need to destroy it is to UNREF it
 blackburn	then ref counter becomes 0 it is automagically destroyed
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	then the thing I was doing wrong is to ref it after
 n4nd0	do you know why is it correct to do it like this and not the other way?
 blackburn	hmm yes
 n4nd0	the other way = ref and unref where the method is callexd
 blackburn	well we should rather ref all the objects automatic
 blackburn	and unref manually
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 blackburn	e.g. how can you SG_REF in python?
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I see it
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok thank you very much man :)
 blackburn	you are welcome
 blackburn	oh I got late for 1.5 hours
 n4nd0	blackburn: btw, it turned out not to solve the seg fault
 n4nd0	blackburn: ups ... I can tell you later then
 blackburn	no problem
 blackburn	n4nd0: what turned out not to solve?
 n4nd0	blackburn: the init_machines_for_apply at the end of train_machine
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have not investigated why, but it didn't solve it
 n4nd0	blackburn: so I am still doing init_machines_for_apply(NULL) at the very beginning of aplly()
 blackburn	try to check what in NULL
 n4nd0	apply(), sorry
 n4nd0	the features of each of the trained machines
 blackburn	hmm does this all the job?
 blackburn	no segfault?
 n4nd0	of m_machine
 n4nd0	yes, like that, it works just fine
 blackburn	ok then
 n4nd0	another thing here
 n4nd0	the constructor without argument of LinearMulticlassMachine
 n4nd0	I think it brings problems
 n4nd0	because if one uses it, then m_machine cannot be set
 n4nd0	and it screws quite a bit ...
 blackburn	uhh.
 blackburn	well actually it shoudln't be used
 n4nd0	train can be called because the object m_machine is created with the default constructor of CMachine
 blackburn	but should safe though
 n4nd0	but it turns out to seg fault that way
 blackburn	n4nd0: just block all the things in this case
 n4nd0	blackburn: block, with an SG_ERROR??
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I mean if someone would like to train machine without machine
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	may be is_ready() stuff should be modified
 n4nd0	I tried to do that
 n4nd0	the easy thing to do if (!m_machine)
 n4nd0	does not work
 n4nd0	because there is m_machine, the default constructor initializes it
 blackburn	with value??
 n4nd0	I don't understand that sorry :S
 n4nd0	it initializes it like CMachine()
 n4nd0	with the default constructor
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	there is no initialization of m_machine actually
 blackburn	shogun / src / shogun / machine / MulticlassMachine.cpp : 20
 blackburn	should be therre
 blackburn	m_machines as well btw
 n4nd0	oh fuck that is right
 n4nd0	I made a mistake because CMachine is called
 n4nd0	but it is called because MulticlassMachine is also a machine ...
 blackburn	I guess that is the problem
 blackburn	then you can check if m_machine is here
 n4nd0	so
 n4nd0	in the default constructor
 n4nd0	if I just set m_machine to null
 n4nd0	it would do the work right?
 blackburn	yes should
 n4nd0	great :)
 blackburn	if I do not get crazy
 n4nd0	let's hope not ;)
 n4nd0	another issue
 n4nd0	MulticlassMachine.cpp:40
 n4nd0	well wait, I probably not talking of the same line number as you can see
 blackburn	clear_machines()?
 n4nd0	but SG_UNREF(m_machine) in the destructor
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	valgrind detects that as invalid read of size 4
 n4nd0	I guess that this must be because this is already unreferenced in another place?
 blackburn	what is the case?
 wiking	blackburn: hey sorry but did you get the point of alex's email?/
 blackburn	wiking: oh I glanced over it and postponed to read thoroughly a little bit later
 blackburn	so not really :D
 wiking	ehhehe ok
 wiking	let me know since i really don't get some stufff
 n4nd0	blackburn: in an example, create a machine*, create a multiclassMachine* with using the previous one
 blackburn	I'll just answer in this thread
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh and it fails??
 n4nd0	blackburn: it doesn't really fail
-!- PSmitAalto [82e9b263@gateway/web/freenode/ip.130.233.178.99] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	that's a bit strange
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is just that valgrind complains that there is an error when doing SG_UNREF in ~CMulticlassMachine()
 n4nd0	maybe I am doing UNREF in my example and I shouldn't
 blackburn	UNREF of?
 n4nd0	I am actually doing UNREF in the example, yes, of the machine*
 blackburn	hmm then you destroy machine
 blackburn	it should be unrefed from the top
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uggif1
 n4nd0	that is a part of the example
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	looks legal
 n4nd0	mmm then
 n4nd0	the unref shouldn't be in the destructor of CMulticlassMachine??
 blackburn	should be I think
 n4nd0	then there must another something wrong mmmm
 blackburn	you didn't ref svm actually
 blackburn	but refed mc_svm
 n4nd0	let me check it again, some other things changed so maybe it was a problem somewhere else
 blackburn	I don't know whether it caused the problem
 n4nd0	ahm
 n4nd0	let me see
 blackburn	but I am 90% sure m_machine should be unrefed
 blackburn	in mc machine
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	you can be 100% :)
 n4nd0	it was the missing SG_REF in the example probably
 blackburn	nice
 n4nd0	I think I am almost done with the job for one-vs-one then
 blackburn	that's nice
 blackburn	actually I came up with reproducing case
 n4nd0	what do you mean?
 blackburn	imagine you have a machine (binary one)
 blackburn	and create some multiclass machine based on that in some function or so
 blackburn	once it is done, multiclass machine is destroyed
 blackburn	but machine REF counter is still has extra 1
 blackburn	remove *is*
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	so machine won't be destroyed at all!
 n4nd0	mmm I see
 n4nd0	but
 n4nd0	I don't know if you mean that this is a potential error
 n4nd0	or?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	so all dependencies should be free'd once they are not needed any more
-!- mayanks43 [~marcus@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	but if the machine already existed, before creating the multiclass machine
 n4nd0	it might be that it is needed somewhere else
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	SG_UNREF will not delete it then
 n4nd0	but that is good
 n4nd0	is not a problem
 blackburn	yes but w/o SG_UNREF
 blackburn	machine would have 2 references
 blackburn	even when multiclass machine is gone
 blackburn	and it won't be deleted
 n4nd0	ah ok
 n4nd0	you are just ensuring that it is good to do the SG_UNREF right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	ok :)
 n4nd0	my bad
 n4nd0	I was thinking that it was a problem that arose *leaving* the SG_UNREF in ~CMulticlassMachine
 blackburn	nono it should be here
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	btw, I am just curious
 n4nd0	not so long time ago I heard about smart pointers
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	woulnd't that make things easier?
 n4nd0	I don't know that much about them thoug! :S
 blackburn	I do not know about swig and these pointers..
 n4nd0	aham, I understand
-!- mayanks43 [~marcus@115.248.130.148] has left #shogun []
 n4nd0	it seems that it is something new in C++
 blackburn	it is ok to be gay^W^W^W to use smart pointers but we should always keep swig in mind
 n4nd0	hahaha
 n4nd0	I was just curious ... c'mon don't call be gay for that :P
 n4nd0	call me*
 blackburn	I just recalled a good old song lol
 blackburn	btw sonney2k rejected me when I asked him to marry me
 blackburn	even this song didn't help
 n4nd0	wtf?!
 n4nd0	don't you have a gf? :P
 n4nd0	which song is that?
 blackburn	so I decided to go to siberia and start dating with bear
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=3j4t185wl-0
 n4nd0	:O
 blackburn	oh sh~ I have to get to work
 blackburn	see you alter

-!- harshit_ [~harshit@59.177.197.85] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	hey harshit_, qu? tal? ;)
 harshit_	bian,y tu?
 n4nd0	bien tambi?n
 harshit_	hey i was thinking to make a new example in matlab : by using 20NewsGroup dataset on linearSVM
 harshit_	what do you think should i do it ?
 n4nd0	harshit_: yeah sure
 harshit_	i thought of doing it in libshogun but i dont know how to open *.mat files in C++
 harshit_	do you hav any idea on how to do that, coz 20Newsgroup datase is available in matlab file only
 n4nd0	I am going to push an example doing that
 harshit_	oh gr8
 n4nd0	but the issue is that the file I am using has no format
 harshit_	that would be useful
 harshit_	ohh
 n4nd0	is just the vector values directly
 n4nd0	the ones you are going to use has format?
 n4nd0	I am downloading the data set to take it a look
 harshit_	yes, matlab stores its matrix and objects in some specific format
 harshit_	i dont think your example could be used on *.mat files
 n4nd0	yeah ... then we cannot do that :(
 n4nd0	but it is something we shoould learn probably
 n4nd0	we have to ask blackburn or sonney2k about that
 n4nd0	eh but wait
 harshit_	yeah.. i'll try to figure that out and if possible i can get an pull out of it
 harshit_	what
 n4nd0	the don't actually have any specific format
 n4nd0	I am reading the files .data .label with a text editor
 n4nd0	and no problem
 n4nd0	so I think you can do that with CStreamingSparseFeatures
 n4nd0	because the representaion of the training data is sparse
 n4nd0	and the labels with CStreamingSimpleFeatures
 n4nd0	in the example I am going to push soon I use CStreamingSimpleFeatures
 n4nd0	so it should be ok to follow as a reference
 n4nd0	in any case ...
 n4nd0	it turned out to be kind of painful for me to do it ... I am not completely sure I got it completely right done
 harshit_	yeah you are right for .label and .data files
 harshit_	but
 n4nd0	so I suggest you to do it first in matlab/octave or python (you can read .mat with python very easy too)
 harshit_	there are also other *.mat files need some way to be used in C++ .no ?
 n4nd0	yes, I totally agree
 harshit_	yeah exactly, thats what i thought, first in matlab and then in C++
 n4nd0	don't know the general way to do it with shogun (don't really know if there is one already actually)
 harshit_	okay so lets do some work ..
 n4nd0	:)
 harshit_	hey one last thing .. i have read a lot of differences between static and modular interfaces but actually till now i dont hav a clear idea of what is the main difference between them
 n4nd0	I don't know exactly either
 n4nd0	I know that static has limitations
 n4nd0	for example it can just one classifier for each program (I think blackburn told me this)
 harshit_	oh thats actually confusing

 blackburn	n4nd0: main difference between static and modular
 blackburn	is that later rocks
 blackburn	while first one sucks
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	latter*
 n4nd0	I knew you were going to say that static sucks :P
 blackburn	the only reason (for me) to keep static is matlab suppor
 n4nd0	but what are the reasons why it does suck?
 blackburn	have you seen static scripts?
 blackburn	pretty poor capabilities
 blackburn	once you add new parameter you HAVE to implement this in static
 n4nd0	I don't see the last point
 blackburn	n4nd0: check shogun/gui folder
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't see that directory man
 blackburn	ui?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	??
 blackburn	shogun/ui?
 blackburn	is there ui?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	mm don't see that
 blackburn	src/shogun/ui
 n4nd0	got it :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: so each time you want to add new feature
 blackburn	you HAVE to implement it in shogun/ui
 n4nd0	aha
 n4nd0	you mean for static right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	while modular is a bleeding edge stuff hah
 n4nd0	I understand

 blackburn	ohhh
 n4nd0	this guy, shogun-buildbot, is always blaming me :(
 blackburn	n4nd0: did not you implement it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: they're with SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
 blackburn	that's strange
 n4nd0	I wanted to discuss with you again first :S
 blackburn	I mean it should work
 blackburn	hah no worries, I'll implement it
 blackburn	ah old build
 blackburn	lets wait
 n4nd0	old build?
 n4nd0	ah ok, the number
 n4nd0	maybe I should change my way of making commits ...
 n4nd0	blackburn: should I do sth about it?

 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah, all is ok

 blackburn	n4nd0: kernel stuff?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah
 blackburn	no, feel free to do that if you want :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok ;)
 blackburn	but it is not a lot of work
 n4nd0	not at all
 blackburn	it is up to you
 blackburn	so do you want to do that?
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 blackburn	all you need is to implement set_subset methods for kernel
 blackburn	for custom it should set_row_subset and set_col_subset
 blackburn	for simple kernels it should add subset to features
 blackburn	same with remove_subset
 n4nd0	for simple is like for the LinearMachine
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	it will be ready soon with some example of use ;)

* sonney2k wakes up
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do you do?
 blackburn	sonney2k: we just talked to n4ndo, and I wasn't able to recall why do you hate STL?
@sonney2k	I feel every muscle / bone today :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: trained yesterday?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
@sonney2k	blackburn, went to the zoo with the 'little' one
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	carrying him all day
@sonney2k	+ backpack
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	what does n4ndo need STL for?
 blackburn	sonney2k: we didn't come up with any example yet :D
 blackburn	but actually there could be places where it would fit better
@sonney2k	10 proposals...
 blackburn	only 2 more today?
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it is ok to provide Kernel LLE capabilities in LocallyLinearEmbedding class?
 blackburn	I mean to remove such duplication
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	now we have both
@sonney2k	I would keep both...
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm ok

 blackburn	sonney2k: so is there any actual reason to avoid STL?
@sonney2k	except that I don't like it you mean?
@sonney2k	probably not
 blackburn	ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, what was that SG_REF / UNREF issue you had with n4nd0?
 blackburn	sonney2k: he forgot to SG_REF svm that he was using
 blackburn	later this svm was passed to generic multiclass thing
@sonney2k	yeah usually that is the issue or that something is not inited with NULL
 blackburn	all is ok now
@sonney2k	or forgotten SG_REF when returning stgh
@sonney2k	sth
