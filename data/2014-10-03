 lerris_129	When I compiled shogun using the matlab static flag, it created libmatlab_static.so in the src/interfaces/matlab_static directory. I can't seem to get this to load into matlab, and most documentation indicates that it should be creating a file named sg.mexglx. I didn't see any compilation errors, and I'm not overly familiar with matlab. Can you point me in the right direction?
