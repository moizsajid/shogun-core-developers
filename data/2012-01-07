 blackburn	sonney2k: hey
 blackburn	do you know when heiko would finish his work?
-!- kate_ [554bc70a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.75.199.10] has joined #shogun
 kate_	hello I a student at TEI of Crete and I have a 15pages project about machine learning and especially shogun. I  found the information i needed for the theory part of the project but i have a problem understanding the code part and therefor using it in order to show i learn something.
 kate_	i
 kate_	II saw the examples but i have problem
 kate_	cause i can't understand what i have to do first before using them.
 kate_	If you can help i would be thankful
 blackburn	kate_: hi, how can I help you?
 blackburn	please be more precise what you have to do/ in which lang/ etc
 kate_	Hi!
 kate_	i would like to explain some of the code in the examples in matlab or java...more in matlab...
 blackburn	are you tied with matlab? can you use e.g. python?
 kate_	yes...i don't know python, well i tried but got confused..
 kate_	what i know is that it's not so different from java or C==
 kate_	C++*
 blackburn	we only have static matlab interface so it is quite outdated
 kate_	so i believe with a little guidense
 blackburn	but for python, java, etc we have modular interfaces
 kate_	ok if i use python
 blackburn	kate_: ok did you compile shogun already?
 kate_	what application should i use?
 kate_	no
 kate_	ok
 kate_	thats the problem
 kate_	how i do that?
 blackburn	what is os you are using?
 kate_	windows 7
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	have you any cygwin experience?
 kate_	no...
 blackburn	the problem is we do not support windows w/o cygwin
 kate_	ok my partner has linux
 kate_	can we use him?
 blackburn	linux is much more preferrable
 blackburn	kate_: which linux?
 blackburn	distribution I mean
 kate_	i can have ubuntu on mine on monday morning...but i don't know what he has and he is off right now...
 blackburn	kate_: you have two ways still - install cygwin or use some linux
 kate_	install cygwin in win7?
 blackburn	yes
 kate_	ok
 kate_	lets do the cygwin cause he is not here
 blackburn	kate_: well it is pretty easy
 kate_	and i need to understand this tonight
 kate_	ok i don't mind
 kate_	as long as i don't bother you
 blackburn	you don't
 kate_	thanks
 kate_	well! what do i do first?
 blackburn	kate_: download cygwin first :)
 blackburn	installer
 blackburn	kate_: then you will have to install some packages
 kate_	ok i did
 kate_	when you say same packages
 kate_	can you be a little more specific?
 blackburn	kate_: yes, you have to install gcc, g++, pkg-config, python, python-numpy
 blackburn	hmm let me recall what else..
 kate_	when it ask me for my internet connection
 kate_	i don't use anything ports like 80 right?
 blackburn	kate_: I guess
 kate_	it says choose a site from the list or add your own link
 kate_	download link
 kate_	wrong download site(s)
 blackburn	no idea..
 kate_	ok
 blackburn	are these sites mirrors?
 kate_	never mind
 blackburn	choose some..
 kate_	i m in the packages
 kate_	and yes they were
 blackburn	kate_: this time check gcc, g++, pkg-config, python, python-numpy
 kate_	finishe
 blackburn	kate_: what exactly you have to do?
 kate_	finish*
 kate_	next step
 blackburn	oh sorry I forgot one more
 blackburn	just run setup once again
 kate_	ok
 kate_	what package to type?
 blackburn	kate_: lapack, git
 blackburn	kate_: are you familiar with linux console commands, etc?
 kate_	the basics yes
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	kate_: then run cygwin just after things get installed
 kate_	ok
 blackburn	create some dir for shogun
 blackburn	and do 'git clone git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git'
 kate_	its still on setup
 blackburn	ok
 kate_	i did the command and its cloning
 kate_	so i believe i m on the right path
 blackburn	nice
 kate_	ok done
 blackburn	cd shogun/src
 blackburn	./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 kate_	done
 blackburn	did it run smooth?
 kate_	yes
 kate_	no errors
 kate_	no nothing
 kate_	ooo
 kate_	nono
 kate_	error pkg-config not detected
 kate_	ooo
 kate_	sorry my bad
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	just install it
 kate_	its ok now
 kate_	it still cheking
 kate_	swig required
 blackburn	damn sorry
 blackburn	forgot it
 kate_	for modular iterfaces
 kate_	ok no prob
 kate_	type make now to compile
 kate_	i m listenong
 kate_	:D
 kate_	listening*

@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know
@sonney2k	I would hope within a few weeks
 blackburn	kate_: yes, do 'make'
 blackburn	sonney2k: bad..
@sonney2k	why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope to start my paper submission asap
 kate_	-bash: make: command not found?
 blackburn	kate_: oh..
 blackburn	you have to install it too..
 kate_	what? the make?
 blackburn	kate_: yes, I thought it is default
 kate_	ok
 kate_	i installed make
 kate_	make -C/examples
 kate_	tsc
 kate_	etc
 kate_	but
 blackburn	ehm?
 kate_	bash ./generate_documented.sh
 blackburn	do make in the shogun/src folder
 blackburn	ah
 kate_	that's where it stoped
 blackburn	you copypaste its output?
 kate_	yes
 kate_	i found the directory
 blackburn	any error message?
 blackburn	I guess it is in process
 kate_	no errors it just stopped...
 kate_	ooh ok
 blackburn	you have to wait a little
 kate_	then i shall wait
 kate_	which place of the world are you? i m asking to because i wondering what time is it there..
 blackburn	kate_: Moscow timezone, 2-08
 blackburn	kate_: I'm in Toliatty, Russia
 kate_	aaah
 kate_	i m in greece
 kate_	here it's 00:09
 kate_	you are 2 hours ahead...
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I guess you are in same timezone with sonney2k :)
 kate_	i dont know..where is he?
 blackburn	Berlin
@sonney2k	23:12 now :)
 kate_	no
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	I'm surprised and lame
 blackburn	:D
 kate_	why?
 blackburn	I thought it is in the same timezone
 blackburn	kate_: are you from creet?
 kate_	i went to denmark in summer for a summerschool and for 3 days i thought i was in the same zone with athens
 kate_	no i m from a small island in aegean
 kate_	i study in crete
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 kate_	its done
 blackburn	I bet it is pretty interesting to live on islands :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: will 'sudo make install' work in the cygwin?
@sonney2k	why sudo?
@sonney2k	just make install
 blackburn	sonney2k: will it work ?
 blackburn	kate_: try 'make install'
 kate_	its fun because you are surrounded by see but its not so pretty in the winter,,
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean will it work without setting path
 kate_	it has an error
 blackburn	kate_: which?
@sonney2k	IIRC you have to do make install DESTDIR-
@sonney2k	err: make install DESTDIR=
 kate_	classifier.ConjugateIndex.cpp.o Error 1
 blackburn	huh
 kate_	Makefile:39: recipe for target `libshogun-12.0.dll' failed make: *** [libshogun-12.0.dll] Error 2
 blackburn	kate_: thanks, you detected an error :)
 kate_	it has more
 kate_	aparently there are many Cblas.....something that ar undeclared
 blackburn	kate_: yes I will fix it just now
 kate_	ok
 blackburn	I introduced this classifier two days before
 kate_	oo
 kate_	thats interesting
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen this classifier btw?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've got 0.7 accuracy on my road signs dataset with HOG and Conjugate index classifier
 blackburn	pretty useless hah
 blackburn	GMNP has ~0.9
@sonney2k	GMNP?
@sonney2k	you mean svm?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	yeah hard to beat svms
 blackburn	sonney2k: well convolutional NNs totally beat svms on such tasks
 blackburn	kate_: you will have to do following
 blackburn	git pull origin
 blackburn	and configure once again
@sonney2k	yeah - but can you train a conv NN that does?
@sonney2k	maybe a git clean -dfx is missing?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've never tried it
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have forgot to enclose my classifier with HAVE_LAPACK
 blackburn	kate_: do git pull once I commit fix
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh don't we have a buildbot testing for that?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't notice it accidentally
 CIA-1	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r141080b / (2 files): Disable Conjugate Index classifier compilation without lapack/cblas - http://git.io/sgSZ-Q
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would like to see the result you get with a conv NN!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would like to see it too
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it would be difficult to train such classifier?
 blackburn	kate_: here you go, do git pull origin
@sonney2k	I expect it will not work right from the start
@sonney2k	there are a couple of tricks that one has to pay attention too
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see
 blackburn	I didn't get much time and motivation to try CNNs yet :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, In case you attempt it make sure to read http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf
@sonney2k	lots of tricks of the trade in there
 blackburn	have you tried it?
 kate_	sorry
 kate_	but
 kate_	kernel error
 kate_	like that "kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:73: error: `CCommUlongStringKernel"
 blackburn	kate_: what is the error?
 kate_	Makefile:39: recipe for target `libshogun-12.0.dll' failed
 blackburn	below
 blackburn	anything else?
 kate_	kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:39: error: expected `,' or `;' before '::' token kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:44: error: `CCommUlongStringKernel' has not been declared
 kate_	this is an example
 kate_	there are many of them
 blackburn	sonney2k: "shuffle the training set ..." - NNs are crazy
 kate_	do you want me to copy and paste all of them?
 blackburn	kate_: yeah that would help
 kate_	ernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp c++: unrecognized option `-pthread' kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position independent) In file included from kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:11: ../shogun/lib/common.h:48:8: warning: undefining "__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS" kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:19: error: `CCommUlongStringKernel' has not been declared kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:20: error: I
 kate_	ok
 kate_	wrong

 blackburn	sonney2k: need your help there, I can't see any reason why it fails
 kate_	can i send you the errors in a txt file?
 kate_	its too big!
 kate_	In file included from kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:11: ../shogun/lib/common.h:48:8: warning: undefining "__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS" kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:19: error: `CCommUlongStringKernel' has not been declared kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:20: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of `CCommUlongStringK                                                     ernel' with no type kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp: In function `int C

 kate_	ok
 blackburn	kate_: well I have quick solution for that
 kate_	tell
 kate_	me
 kate_	please
 blackburn	remove src/shogun/kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp and src/shogun/kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.h
 blackburn	you
 blackburn	speak
 blackburn	funny
 blackburn	:D
 kate_	berofe i explain my funny talking (:D) i will do a quick question, should i install remove pkg?
 blackburn	install what?
 kate_	remove
 blackburn	I do not understand..
 kate_	command...command did not found
 blackburn	just remove files
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	rm
 blackburn	rm src/shogun/kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.*
 blackburn	that's a lame fix but I think you won't need that kernel.. :)
 kate_	No such file or directory
 blackburn	I guess you are already in src
 blackburn	then just
 blackburn	rm shogun/kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.*
 blackburn	and make it
 kate_	ok now
 kate_	and i will do make again?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I hope there won't be such errors
 blackburn	no idea why it appears on cygwin
 kate_	c++: unrecognized option `-pthread' ui/GUIHMM.cpp:1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position independent) In file included from ../shogun/io/SGIO.h:25,                  from ../shogun/base/SGObject.h:15,                  from ../shogun/ui/GUIHMM.h:16,                  from ui/GUIHMM.cpp:12:

 kate_	make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/Kate/shogun/src/shogun' Makefile:39: recipe for target `libshogun-12.0.dll' failed make: *** [libshogun-12.0.dll] Error 2
 blackburn	ok sure
 blackburn	do git clean -dfx
 blackburn	and ./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 blackburn	and make
 blackburn	sorry for such inconvenience - we don't like cygwin too much :)
 kate_	no worries...
 blackburn	but in fact it compiles on our buildbot..
 kate_	i should have change to linux 15 months now
 blackburn	I consider linux to be more convenient for some tasks such as do machine learning :)
