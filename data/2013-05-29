@wiking	aaaand 32 bit
 gsomix	wiking, visual studio?

@iglesiasg	I missed my normal life :(
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: when is the deadline/
@lisitsyn	?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: there is no hard deadline, you present once you are done
@iglesiasg	anyway, I expect to have finished writing by this weekend
@iglesiasg	and present in max two weeks
@lisitsyn	interesting :)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: then set it for yourself ;)

@lisitsyn	there is a chance to push it forward then
@iglesiasg	yes! that would be great
@lisitsyn	I am not sure if I leave 'industry' at some point

@sonney2k	lambday, hey lamb-day? Thanks for enlightening us about you nick :D
 lambday	sonney2k: lol
@sonney2k	lambday, mind that I add your blog to shogun planet?
 lambday	sonney2k: no problem :)
 lambday	but its pretty useless as of now :(
@sonney2k	lambday, here I mean http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun

 lambday	sonney2k: sure :)
 lambday	sonney2k: I gotta be more careful what I write then :D
 lambday	once I was working from my lab and a guy came, saw my github id, and asked wtf is lamb-day :D
@iglesiasg	day of the lamb! :D
 lambday	I'll go with the "silence" rather :D
 lambday	but lamb-silence sounded even stupid :D
@sonney2k	lambday, OK you are on
@sonney2k	lambday, something is weird though the headline is not a pointer to your blog as it is supposed to be
 lambday	sonney2k: I changed it later :-/
@HeikoS	lambday, haha, nice with the name
 lambday	HeikoS: :D
@sonney2k	something is weird hmmhh
 lambday	I do realize that my email id is probably even weirdest among all of us :D
 lambday	I made it long back... like 7-8 years ago, to impress girls :|
 gsomix	Good. >> Your unsubscription to google-summer-of-code-students-list was successful.
@sonney2k	lambday, heavensdevil! it works!
@sonney2k	gsomix, it will come back
@sonney2k	lambday, so now blog as much as you like :D
 lambday	sonney2k: not even once :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, really? oh.
@sonney2k	gsomix, I am still suffering from the mentors mailinglist
 lambday	sonney2k: yup :D
@sonney2k	for some reason I am subscribed with 2 email addresses
 lambday	sonney2k: *after checking the shogun-planet* shit just got real ! :-o
@sonney2k	lambday, hehe
@sonney2k	alright gtg
 gsomix	lambday, haskell-user? I think we need the haskell interface for shogun. but there is no support in the swig. :)
 lambday	sonney2k: ciao
 lambday	gsomix: I was totally in love with haskell...
 lambday	gsomix: now I hardly remember her name :(
 gsomix	lambday, huh.
 lambday	gsomix: jk... btw I checked it last year.. no swig support for haskell
 gsomix	and matlab support. it's really needed... but we can interface shogun with LISP! :D
@lisitsyn	don't you guys know about filtering mails or what :D
 lambday	gsomix: that's a nice idea :)
@lisitsyn	common lisp is supported
 lambday	I never used lisp :(
 lambday	carol is so patient! replies each and every mail !!
@lisitsyn	yes she is an angel :D
 lambday	she really is... :-o
 gsomix	lisitsyn, interesting how many people uses lisp for ML?
@lisitsyn	gsomix: no one? ML is just a linear algebra
 gsomix	lisitsyn, btw, I don't know about filtering. gmail's interface too hard for me. :(
 gsomix	lisitsyn, are there no blas/lapack wrappers for lisp?
@lisitsyn	gsomix: you don't get any advantage calling wrappers - researchers just use matlab
 gsomix	lisitsyn, ok
@lisitsyn	even simplest thing would look obscure (add x (add y z))

@sonney2k	gsomix, hey!
@sonney2k	how is it going?
@sonney2k	foulwall, do you have an idea how to make the code more re-usable?
 gsomix	sonney2k, not good and not bad. :] I'm sorry, but things will done tomorrow (or at night): many homework at the end of academic year. :|
@sonney2k	:(
 gsomix	sonney2k, all ok..? I think I able to finish piece in a few hours. and then continue work on reader.
 gsomix	sonney2k, don't be sad. :)

@lisitsyn	I am available
@sonney2k	gsomix, hushell pickle27 van51 you too?
 van51	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	foulwall will be asleep for sure and v* too
 van51	8:30 gmt?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, alterantively we do 2 short ones
@lisitsyn	I am available for anything
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
 pickle27	what time zone?
@sonney2k	van51, well 11 UTC or 19 UTC
@sonney2k	I am not sure yet
 pickle27	I could do an early meeting tomorrow
@sonney2k	pickle27, early as in?
 pickle27	oh right woops
 pickle27	timezones
@sonney2k	UTC time please
 pickle27	I am on mountain time for the moment at a conference
@sonney2k	mountain?
 pickle27	its 13:25 here for me
@sonney2k	so UTC-6
@sonney2k	11 would be 5 am for you then :D
 pickle27	so maybe 19 UTC then?
 pickle27	I can do that if we need to though

@sonney2k	lets have a short vote
 vgorbat	sonney2k: vote?
@sonney2k	http://www.doodle.com/ekqntucvq9wb66cw#table
@sonney2k	pickle27, gsomix, van51 , lisitsyn ^
 van51	hmm on one hand I'd prefer 11 UTC but on the other hand I feel sorry for pickle27
 van51	so I'll vote for both :)
@sonney2k	vgorbat, well you don't have too
 pickle27	vote 19 UTC
 van51	pickle27: it's your lucky day :p
 pickle27	van51, :)
 vgorbat	sonney2k: I'll try UTC 19.00, but can't promise

@sonney2k	must be this german attitude again
@sonney2k	van51, that and that you didn't send me an email to my shogun-toolbox.org address but to my work address I dont' have access too atm
 van51	lisitsyn: mysteryyy hehe
 van51	sonney2k: hmm that makes a bit sense
 van51	sonney2k: would you like an empty email now?
@sonney2k	van51, yes!
@sonney2k	van51, and no idea if you have seen oliviers email?
@sonney2k	but you really should get into things
 van51	I've seen it
 van51	and replied
@sonney2k	olivier is kind of a rock star ... well quoc to :D
 van51	actually I will forward my reply to you
 van51	instead of an empty email
@sonney2k	yeah please keep me in the loop
 van51	sonney2k: sent
 van51	cool, hope some of that rock star-ness will rub off on me
@sonney2k	van51, we have to think about some cool applications already now
 van51	sonney2k: like for examples or suggestions?
@sonney2k	van51, yeah some real application for that...
@sonney2k	otherwise we have some cool algorithms that just sit there and rot
@sonney2k	b'cause no one knows what cool stuff you can do with them
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, I have realized that DynArray is not very useful for rolling buffer: it's not resizable and indexed with respect to the data, not the beginning of a block of memory
 van51	sonney2k: I get what you're saying
@sonney2k	van51, we had that with the streamingfeatures that were written 2 gsoc's ago
 van51	they weren't used?
 van51	have you managed to counter that?
@sonney2k	van51, we really need something fancy... like upload your text document and it tells you who has written it or sth
@sonney2k	van51, or upload some part of the linux kernel source code and it will tell you who wrote it or sth
@sonney2k	no they just sit there and I don't think people use them but who knows
@sonney2k	so we really need catchy examples
@sonney2k	gsomix, errm why not?
@sonney2k	gsomix, you don't have to resize it at all
@sonney2k	but yes you could create some extra class doing that all in some char* rolling_buffer thing
 gsomix	sonney2k, so only one thing from DynArray that in needed in rolling buffer is array.
 gsomix	*in needed
 van51	sonney2k: ok.. I like your ideas and I understand why a good example/demo is important
 van51	sonney2k: btw the referenced on the hashing idea are the same as in the fast food one?
 van51	references*
@sonney2k	van51, something simple would be to tell whether a text is from a news article or certain types of books
@sonney2k	van51, errm
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes only the array
@sonney2k	gsomix, so you could as well use SGVector<char>
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok
@sonney2k	van51, and ask me anything about dotfeatures - I wrote them...
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do you think it will help with sparse features?
@lisitsyn	I mean why to increase dim of sparse features
-!- chap_ [c7cca90a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.199.204.169.10] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what exactly?
@sonney2k	you mean dot features in general?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I mean with texts
@lisitsyn	they are usually sparse
-!- chap_ [c7cca90a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.199.204.169.10] has quit [Client Quit]
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well if you work on the original text document you can embed the text immediately
@sonney2k	for training that might not be the best thing you can do (only for online learning)
@sonney2k	because the sparse representation  is usually more memory efficient
@sonney2k	but hashing for sure even helps for that
@lisitsyn	yeah true
@sonney2k	gsomix, looking forward to a PR
* sonney2k off
