 moooore	hello
 moooore	anybody here?
 moooore	I've built shogun matlab static interface
 moooore	when I type sg('help')
 moooore	it says;
 moooore	>> sg('help') Undefined function 'sg' for input arguments of type 'char'.
 moooore	I'm working on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 moooore	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/shogun/src/shogun/lib
 moooore	I couldn't find sg.oct or sg.mexglx files
 moooore	anybody here to help?

 shaochuan	moooore: yo?
 moooore	shaochuan: did you build shogun?
 moooore	shaochuan: do you know matlab interface
 shaochuan	moooore: unfortunately, no.
 moooore	shaochuan: where are you from
 shaochuan	moooore: sorry I only built it using cmake and called it from python
 shaochuan	moooore: so I didn't use it via matlab
 shaochuan	moooore: I live in CA, why?
 moooore	how did you do it with python interface?
 moooore	I live in Los Angeles
 shaochuan	moooore: it's not that hard if you know how to use cmake; you need to install what was missing
 shaochuan	moooore: when doing the build
 moooore	I installed the modular python interface successfully
 shaochuan	moooore: what's your operating system? if you're building shogun on ubuntu, that's even easier
 moooore	how can I test it if it's working properly
 moooore	I'm also working on Ubuntu
 moooore	how can I test it if it's working properly on Python?
 shaochuan	import modshogun
 shaochuan	or just try to run a python example code
 moooore	>>> import modshogun Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ImportError: No module named modshogun
 moooore	what are the prerequisite steps? like add to path etc.
 shaochuan	that would mean you didn't build and install shogun properly
 shaochuan	did you build shogun successfully?
 shaochuan	using cmake it would generate a Makefile for you
 shaochuan	if successfully built with python module turned on, and after sudo make install you should have python wrapper of shogun installed
 moooore	cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 moooore	sudo make install
 moooore	and it's installed in shogun-install directory
 shaochuan	okay assuming you successfully built it
 shaochuan	in python you'll need to add the include python sys path because you installed at $HOME/shogun-install
 shaochuan	not the system default python 3rd lib path
 moooore	how can I do that?
 shaochuan	one-off way
 shaochuan	import sys
 shaochuan	sys.path.append('<the path>')
 shaochuan	or set PYTHONPATH in your bash environement
 shaochuan	environment*
 moooore	sys.path.append('/home/user/shogun-install')
 moooore	is this correct
 moooore	shaochuan: is this correct?
 shaochuan	maybe not, I'll need to see where modshogun is placed
 shaochuan	it may be in one of subdirs
 moooore	dd
 moooore	modshogun.py is under /home/user/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
 shaochuan	right
 shaochuan	I'll try to add this path to sys.path
 shaochuan	sys.path.append('/home/user/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
 shaochuan	and then import modshogun
 moooore	ok
 shaochuan	see if it stops throwing exception
 moooore	it says Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 32, in <module>     _modshogun = swig_import_helper()   File "/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 28, in swig_import_helper     _mod = imp.load_module('_modshogun', fp, pathname, description) ImportError: libshogun.so.1
 shaochuan	libshogun.so is not found. it could be the lib was not built and installed properly, or you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 moooore	libshogun.so is under /home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib
 shaochuan	OK. Then you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 shaochuan	like example here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1439
 moooore	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib
 moooore	File "<stdin>", line 1     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib                     ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
 shaochuan	nono LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set in your bash environment
 moooore	ok
 moooore	thanks a lot
 shaochuan	something like export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib in ~/.bashrc
 moooore	I did LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/cansinmustafa/shogun-install/lib in the terminal bash environment
 moooore	then type python, then import modshogun
 moooore	it didn't work
 moooore	sha
 moooore	shaochuan:
 shaochuan	same error?
 shaochuan	you'll need to run sys.path.append('/home/user/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages') again because it was one-off setting
 moooore	in python, right?
 moooore	shaochuan: it worked
 moooore	:)
 moooore	thank you very much
 shaochuan	oh cool
 shaochuan	moooore: sure
 moooore	shaochuan: thanks
 shaochuan	you're welcome
 moooore	shaochuan: is this setting permanent, or should I do these whenever I run python on terminal?
 shaochuan	you can set PYTHONPATH in your bash environment
 shaochuan	http://askubuntu.com/questions/250929/pythonpath-environment-variable
 shaochuan	so I'll recommend to export PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc
 shaochuan	then you don't need to set them every time you want to run shogun
 moooore	shaochuan: have you ever worked with MKL with shogun python interface?
 moooore	multiple kernel lerarning?
 moooore	learning?
 moooore	shaochuan: ?
 shaochuan	moooore: I did use MKL like 4 years ago. At that time I was using matlab, and wrote matlab extension via C by myself
 shaochuan	moooore: however, I didn't use MKL with shogun python yet
 moooore	are you academician?
 shaochuan	moooore: it shouldn't be that hard I guess, if you already knew how MKL works
 shaochuan	moooore: I was, but not anymore.
 moooore	I have used libsvm for support vector regression
 moooore	now I want to try MKL
 moooore	what do you do know?
 shaochuan	I would try to read this paper before trying MKL: http://jmlr.org/papers/volume7/sonnenburg06a/sonnenburg06a.pdf
 shaochuan	after that I would try to run this example: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/python_modular_examples.html#python_modular_mkl_examples
 moooore	shaochuan: I've already read the paper you mentioned
 shaochuan	oh I'll try to run the shogun example
 moooore	shaochuan: when I try to run the example, I got errors,
 shaochuan	what kind of errors?
 moooore	Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ImportError: No module named tools.load
 shaochuan	looks like tools.load.LoadMatrix is in example
 shaochuan	one sec, let me boot my shogun machine...
 moooore	okay, thank you very much for your help and time
 shaochuan	it would take a while to boot; i'll reply later about 10mins
 moooore	do you have facebook or anything alike to communicate

 moooore	shaochuan: yes I'm waiting for you
 moooore	shaochuan: are you there now?
 shaochuan	moooore: I believe tools.load is with examples
 moooore	you mean it is under somewhere /home/user/shogun-install/share/shogun/examples/libshogun
 shaochuan	yes. I'm checking out to confirm that
 moooore	shogun-install is the directory where I installed shogun python interface
 shaochuan	my machine was an EC2 machine so it took a while to boot
 moooore	ok, no problem, you're helping me. I appreciate that
 shaochuan	btw, you ran `./generate_documented.sh` right?
 shaochuan	./generate_documented.sh is under src/shogun/examples/documented
 moooore	shaochuan: no, I guess I didn't.. I honestly have no idea what it is
 moooore	how do I run it?
 shaochuan	where did you download the shogun source?
 shaochuan	go to that directory
 moooore	ok
 shaochuan	cd <downloaded_shogun_src_root_folder>/examples/documented/python_modular
 shaochuan	cd <downloaded_shogun_src_root_folder>/examples/documented/
 shaochuan	run
 shaochuan	sorry under "srshogun/examples"
 shaochuan	run generate_documented.sh
 shaochuan	by ./generate_documented.sh
 moooore	ok I run ./generate_documented.sh
 shaochuan	go to source folder
 shaochuan	I assume you download the source by git clone, right?
 shaochuan	do
 shaochuan	git submodule init
 shaochuan	git submodule update
 shaochuan	you need to download the data
 shaochuan	the above two commands will help you download the data by git submodules
 moooore	I downloaded the source directly from shogun-toolbox website
 moooore	ok
 shaochuan	oh
 moooore	I will do it now
 shaochuan	I see
 shaochuan	yeah git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 shaochuan	so git repo include the examples too
 shaochuan	do
 shaochuan	git submodule init
 shaochuan	git submodule update
 shaochuan	after that you will have data downloaded
 shaochuan	for example
 shaochuan	I do `git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git`
 shaochuan	under /mnt

 shaochuan	I will have `/mnt/shogun` folder
 shaochuan	now type `cd /mnt/shogun` in my bash
 shaochuan	and then type `git submodule init`
 shaochuan	and then `git submodule update`
 shaochuan	and then `cd examples`
 shaochuan	run `./generate_documented.sh`
 shaochuan	it should have downloaded the examples and the tools you're missing
 shaochuan	in my case it's `/mnt/shogun/examples/documented/python_modular`
 shaochuan	now run `python mkl_multiclass_modular.py`
 shaochuan	you should see no more errors
 moooore	I will try them all, now I'm trying to install git, because I didn't have it
 shaochuan	oh ok
 moooore	Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y 0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (2001:67c:1562::13)]
 moooore	but it stucks here
 moooore	can't download git
 shaochuan	did you use "sudo apt-get install git"?
 shaochuan	not sure why it got stuck
 shaochuan	maybe on shogun website it can download data too?(I'm not sure)
 moooore	yes
 moooore	I can download the data there
 shaochuan	then you must put the data under your src/data path
 shaochuan	for example, in my case it's /mnt/shogun/data
 moooore	ok I got it
 shaochuan	I think you should be able to run them
 moooore	thank you very much
 shaochuan	sure I need to go now
 moooore	can I have your email?
 moooore	just in case
 moooore	shaochuan: ?
 shaochuan	shaochuan.wang (_at_) gmail.com
 moooore	thank you very much Shaochuan
 shaochuan	no problem. good night

 mooore	hi all
@wiking	y
 mooore	anybody know anything about matlab interface?
 mooore	I built matlab interface successfully
 mooore	on ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 mooore	it says sg is not defined!
 mooore	I couldn't find sg.oct or sg.mexglx (name varies with architecture)
 mooore	wiking: ?
@wiking	mooore: mmm
@wiking	r u sure you want to use matlab static interface?
 mooore	wiking: yes, I want to try it why?
@wiking	mmm it basically doesn't have most of the new (last couple of years) features of shogun
 mooore	wiking: does it have multiple kernel learning regression?
 mooore	wiking: ?
 mooore	wiking: I've also built Python modular interface
@wiking	python modular has it
@wiking	i'm not sure about matlab static
 mooore	wiking: python examples don't run with out adding import sys sys.path.append('/home/user/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')
 mooore	wiking: why?
 mooore	after 'make install' it created many files but none of them are py files..
 mooore	include, lib and share directories
 mooore	wiking: can you briefly explain me this

@besser82	wiking, hey, there she is with that problem about PythonModular on the Mac --> marina
@wiking	marina: e cao....
@wiking	marina: it's better to talk here
@wiking	please first tell me what's the version of you osx
@wiking	and clang
@wiking	(clang --version)
 marina	hello wiktor
 marina	my version is OS X Yosemite
 marina	Version 10.10
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	and what's your swig verison?
@wiking	*version
 marina	how do i get this information?
@besser82	marina, in terminal `swig --version`
 marina	marina:Downloads marinavidovic$ swig --version Unable to find option or file '--version', use 'swig -help' for more information.
@wiking	swig -version
 marina	SWIG Version 3.0.2  Compiled with /usr/bin/clang++ [x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0]  Configured options: +pcre
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	okey so basically we have a bug that hasn't been solved for a while
@wiking	since we r all busy
@wiking	but anyhow
@wiking	i can tell u how to overcome one bug
@wiking	but i'm not so sure would that help you 100%
 marina	lets try it!
@besser82	wiking, just tell us, I'll give further assitance if this go wr0ng ^^
@wiking	so you would need to edit the CMakeLists.txt
 marina	ok
@wiking	and replace this line
@wiking	                        SET(TARGET_SWIGFLAGS "-builtin\;-modern\;-modernargs")
@wiking	with this
@wiking	SET(TARGET_SWIGFLAGS "-builtin")
 marina	where do I find the cmakelists.txt?
@besser82	in your shogung checkout-dir  ;)
@wiking	it's in the directory where you've checked out shoung
@wiking	*shogun
@wiking	most probably shogun
@besser82	marina, should be "/Users/marinavidovic/Documents/work/POIM/shogun/shogun " for you  ;)
@besser82	wiking, many thanks ^^  :D
 marina	thx @besser82 :-)
@besser82	marina, gern geschehen  :D
@wiking	marina: inace za cega hoces da koristis shogun?
@lisitsyn	chego vse na svoem yazyke razgovarivayut?
@wiking	lisitsyn: hahahahahhah u arrived :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, hola!  :D
@lisitsyn	besser82: hey there
@wiking	lisitsyn: so when r u immigrating? :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: when usdrub reaches 100 :D
@lisitsyn	(soon)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	it's 60 now?
@lisitsyn	~57
@wiking	almost
@wiking	well fuck
@lisitsyn	was ~32 an year ago
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	putin is working hard on the matter
@wiking	and when putin decides something
@lisitsyn	and hey my salary didn't increase in the same fashion :D
@wiking	he'll make it for sure :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: shit /,
@wiking	:<
@wiking	lisitsyn: inflation crazy?
 marina	in the line is also py3: SET(TARGET_SWIGFLAGS "-builtin\;-modern\;-modernargs\;-py3")
@lisitsyn	wiking: I'd guess ~12%
 marina	i replace it anyway right?
@wiking	marina: noup that should be alright... unless u use python3 by default
@besser82	marina, yes
@wiking	lisitsyn: :S
 marina	no...i use python.7
 marina	2.7
@wiking	marina: then it should be fine
 marina	ok...done
@lisitsyn	wiking: google to close moscow engineering :D
 marina	what should I do next?
@besser82	marina, then let's finish that build off ^^
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i just saw that now
@besser82	marina, let go back to query in german ^^
 marina	ok :-)
@lisitsyn	everything goes cool last months I am freaking lucky :D
@wiking	lisitsyn: so what now, all the engineers are relocated?
@lisitsyn	wiking: rumours are, yeah
@lisitsyn	to zurich etc
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	suddenly massive visa applications for russians in .ch
@wiking	 :P
@lisitsyn	there are just <100 of them :D
@wiking	heheh still
@lisitsyn	well that's google's issue to solve visa problem :D
@wiking	besser82: there's still a possibility that it'll fail...
@besser82	wiking, many many thx, btw ^^
@wiking	besser82: then try using gcc 4.8
@wiking	besser82: some weird shit is happening with 10.10's compiler
@besser82	wiking, I know... let's wait for the build and afterwards I'll try to fix stuff then ^^
@wiking	okkey
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah true
@wiking	lisitsyn: my visa took 3 whole days to get approved
@besser82	wiking, if there unforeseen trouble, I'll cycle back to you :D
@wiking	nw
@wiking	lisitsyn: do u know gogol bordello?
@wiking	although he is ukranian
@lisitsyn	wiking: indeed
@lisitsyn	wiking: well ukrainian music was popular here before we claimed they are fascists and eat children
@wiking	:D
@wiking	hahahahah
@lisitsyn	wiking: that's actually very close to quote what you can hear from tv :)
@wiking	yeah i can totally see that
@wiking	i mean imagine

@wiking	lisitsyn: indeeed
@lisitsyn	I mean it could lead to some porn overflow
@wiking	the latest thing is that all kids in the school will be drugtested
@lisitsyn	if you don't have proper connection
@wiking	all kids between 12-18
@wiking	:D
@lisitsyn	hmm happens here as well

@wiking	:>
@wiking	good fucking god where that country will end up
@wiking	:)))
@lisitsyn	I am curious where life seems more conscious
@lisitsyn	must be some place
@wiking	START WEARING PURPLE FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!!!
