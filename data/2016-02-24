@drwiking	ok so you can push the things u want
@HeikoS	drwiking: especially that it is updated automagically
@HeikoS	drwiking: I just change the Dockerfile right?
@drwiking	and it'll generate it
@drwiking	yes
@drwiking	change commit push
@drwiking	done
@HeikoS	no need to push to dockerhub
@drwiking	nono
@drwiking	there's a hook for it
@HeikoS	ah man, amazing, exactly how it should be
@drwiking	but now
@HeikoS	drwiking: I think it might be good to put a section into README_developer to point people to this
@drwiking	couple of ground rules for this year
@drwiking	if we get gsoc
@HeikoS	drwiking: shoot
@drwiking	a) we fix leaking shit :)
@HeikoS	drwiking: haha! :) have a list?
@drwiking	b) we dont fucking allow every that somebdy creates a cpp with 1000+ LoC
@drwiking	(see cartree)
@drwiking	c) if we have a linalg package inside lets start to use it
@drwiking	(again good example of cartree)
@drwiking	d) the linalg should start to be the basic thing imo
@drwiking	that should have
@HeikoS	yeah agree
@HeikoS	leagoetz: maybe we should put these things into the GSoC page
@drwiking	1) vanialla implementation 2) eigen 3) viennacl
@drwiking	etc
@HeikoS	drwiking: btw meet leagoetz who helps us with GSoC organisation this year
@drwiking	leagoetz: welcome!
 leagoetz	hi there
@drwiking	yeah lets see if we get gsoc this year
@drwiking	and how many slots
@HeikoS	drwiking: yeah fingers crossed
@drwiking	but i'm hoping to have 5 slots at least
@HeikoS	drwiking: I dont want to do more than 5 I think
@drwiking	if we get it
@HeikoS	drwiking: rather mentor tight
@drwiking	but still that'll gonna be madness
@HeikoS	haha indeed
@drwiking	but as you can see
 leagoetz	that's why I help :)
@drwiking	now all is green
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	we have good projects
@HeikoS	drwiking: yeah and that is great
@drwiking	(travis + buildbot)
@HeikoS	! :)
@HeikoS	and we managed to release
@HeikoS	almost magic haha
@drwiking	yep
@drwiking	we could do another minor release
@drwiking	if we fix the mem leaks
@drwiking	mmm that reminds me
@drwiking	i should look into our csv parser :)))))
@drwiking	to overcome the magic limit
@HeikoS	drwiking: oh yes
@HeikoS	drwiking: I would drop all the csv reading code tbh
@HeikoS	use a header only lib
@drwiking	like?
@HeikoS	I think I suggested one somewhere
@HeikoS	let me check
@drwiking	btw i started to work on a feature/performance branch
@drwiking	becuase just like kmeans
@HeikoS	drwiking: https://github.com/ben-strasser/fast-cpp-csv-parser
@drwiking	there's a lot of shitty performance in the code
@drwiking	just because of shitty code
@HeikoS	drwiking: I know
@HeikoS	but I think there might be some high level design issues also
@drwiking	and it's really a bit embarrasing
@HeikoS	scikit learn is sooo much faster
@drwiking	that we are c+
@HeikoS	I agree
@drwiking	and highlevel code like python
@HeikoS	especially with the simple algos
@drwiking	beat us with performance
@HeikoS	drwiking: yeah
@HeikoS	saw the project for that?
@drwiking	yeah i mean scikitlearn
@HeikoS	?
@drwiking	i mean dont get me wrong
@HeikoS	the usual suspects?
@HeikoS	its about that
@drwiking	but that is a piece of fucking shit
@drwiking	code wise :)
@HeikoS	I know ;)
@drwiking	(hello internet yes i did say that!!!)
@HeikoS	public irc
@HeikoS	hahaha
@HeikoS	drwiking is back
@drwiking	keep it real shogun logger!!
@drwiking	i want to have this publicly available
@drwiking	*forever*!
@HeikoS	drwiking: well we better fix things then
@drwiking	yes
@HeikoS	drwiking: doesnt have to be us
@drwiking	exactly
@drwiking	i know
@HeikoS	students can do that
@HeikoS	we just guide
@HeikoS	this guy started working on kmeans
@drwiking	but there are some stuff to be done first
@drwiking	yeah i saw
@HeikoS	saurabh
@HeikoS	he did gsoc 2014 with us btw
@drwiking	but he starts from the wrong end
@HeikoS	i know
@HeikoS	we have to tell him
@HeikoS	he did good work once guided in the right way back in 2014
@HeikoS	btw feel free to put your thoughts into the project descr
@drwiking	yeah
@drwiking	i started to work on some other stuff
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2016_project_fundamental_usual_suspects
@drwiking	distributing shogun
@drwiking	but that's very early bird
@drwiking	lets see how it works out
@HeikoS	great, curious to see that
@HeikoS	I mean if this gsoc goes through and we do all the primary proects
@besser82	HeikoS, drwiking: Hey guys!
@HeikoS	then we really can focus on things as distributing
@HeikoS	since we solved the basic stuff
@HeikoS	besser82: hey man
@drwiking	hey hey
@besser82	I hope I can finish my work on pluginizing stuff this weekend
@drwiking	?
@besser82	general-usecase dynamic loading
@HeikoS	drwiking: btw I think you forgot the docker at one place
@besser82	so we can use that for shogun
@HeikoS	drwiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L66
@HeikoS	still contains your image
@HeikoS	besser82: make sure to check the project on that and talk to sergey
@drwiking	HeikoS: !!!!
@drwiking	fuck
@drwiking	ok fixing
@HeikoS	we have drafted a lot, so lets keep it synched
@besser82	HeikoS, have already talked to sergey about it ^^
@HeikoS	besser82: even better
@HeikoS	so what are you exactly doing?
@besser82	the plan is split shogun in a base lib and functional plugins
@besser82	so we can reduce swig-stuff significantly

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: run shogun/shogun-dev in travis
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: this is a leftover from the previous commit :(
@drwiking	yeah lets have the gstreamer of ML :>
@besser82	HeikoS, when things are done we'll have a libshogun and a libsgmath
@drwiking	ok so that should fix it

@HeikoS	besser82: sgmath?
@besser82	yeah for splitting out different possible math-backends, e.g. one for eigen3, one using ViennaCL, etc
@drwiking	\o/
@drwiking	that shoudl be good
@drwiking	although have anybody seen the .so ;)
@HeikoS	drwiking:  this ok?
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3003
@drwiking	it's not that big
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah in fact calling it sgmath is better than linalg
@drwiking	HeikoS: that should do it
@besser82	hehe ^^
@HeikoS	drwiking: still would be good to be able to only compile the class I am working on
@HeikoS	when adding new algos I dont want to care about the rest of shogun
@HeikoS	so that I can use it for my research code again
@drwiking	HeikoS: make sure that you wait a while to get the docker image updated
@drwiking	HeikoS: true
@drwiking	that's why plugin is better
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	yep
@besser82	HeikoS, the final plan is: we have real flexibility for different environments and/or systems
@HeikoS	drwiking: btw rahul interns at my unit starting in march
@HeikoS	for coding
@drwiking	:DDD
@HeikoS	so he can give shogun some love
@HeikoS	first 2 months are from home
@drwiking	UCL?
@HeikoS	then 3 months in person
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	first 2 months are for coding
@drwiking	so when do u finish? :)
@HeikoS	I mean we have some agenda, but can sneak in some shogun stuff, especially linalg etc
@HeikoS	drwiking: me? 1.5 yrs at least
@drwiking	cool
@drwiking	btw
@drwiking	just as a simple example my friend

@drwiking	i've measured the other day
@drwiking	pipe-ing data
@drwiking	from /dev/zero to /dev/null :)
@drwiking	man
@drwiking	in python you have a 50% overhead :D
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	I did that once too a while ago
@drwiking	i mean wtf
@HeikoS	but yeah in sklearn you can see that if you code clever, you can be better than c++ and stupid code
@HeikoS	so clever code is more important that anything else
@drwiking	mmm well
@drwiking	python = clever code, i.e. dont use any functions
@drwiking	:))))
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	drwiking: ha!
@drwiking	because a function code is an overhead
@drwiking	:D
@HeikoS	drwiking: thats what I do in my research code
@drwiking	hahhahaha
@drwiking	fuck that man
@drwiking	engineering
@HeikoS	so annyoing, makes developing modular so hard
@drwiking	a bit
@HeikoS	and test driven impossible
@drwiking	hhahaha
@drwiking	matlab to the rescue? :)
@HeikoS	wish I could use shogun for my papers
@drwiking	hahahahaha
@drwiking	u use what? :)
@HeikoS	so need plugin
@drwiking	python
@HeikoS	yes
@drwiking	for sure
@drwiking	:DDD
@drwiking	hahahahha
@HeikoS	fastest to develop
@HeikoS	thats the thing
@drwiking	yeah fucking shit :)
@drwiking	internet yes i still said that!!! <-
@HeikoS	time counts, so I accept having to write shitty code in order to make it run reasonably fast
@drwiking	>>> WARNING :)<<<
@drwiking	yeah but that's not reasonable
@drwiking	but i do understand what you say
@HeikoS	drwiking: thats why I am pushing shogun currently
@HeikoS	I want to use it
@HeikoS	if I dont use it, who would use it?
@drwiking	mm
@drwiking	this lib looks cool
@drwiking	(csv
@drwiking	bu tman
@drwiking	17 commits :D
@drwiking	not a stable sw
@HeikoS	drwiking: indeed
@HeikoS	but I am sure there is something in these lines
@drwiking	ok btw
@HeikoS	shogun codebase should be cleaned of things such as file reading
@drwiking	wtf is with the bsd hing

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: use exact version from develop
@HeikoS	drwiking: it is decided
@HeikoS	drwiking: sergey posted a script that generates author for new headers
@HeikoS	drwiking: so now just need to change things
@HeikoS	and then go through the gpl things that we copy/pasted by hand and remove, but should not be many
@HeikoS	5.0 release should be bsd
@HeikoS	drwiking: got any idea what is a good next step here?
@HeikoS	drwiking: need your opinion one something
@HeikoS	drwiking: sphinx can render math using latex, or produce mathjax stuff
@HeikoS	second is obviously nicer
@HeikoS	but it doesnt allow to specify a preamble easily in sphinx
@HeikoS	which is why I used latex png for now
@HeikoS	but now need to install latex on travis image as well
@drwiking	latx png
@drwiking	fuck that
@drwiking	mathjax
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	where your problem? :)
@drwiking	show me
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	drwiking: any idea how to add preample for that?
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	sec
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/sphinxdoc/doc/cookbook/source/conf.py
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/sphinxdoc/doc/cookbook/source/conf.py#L221
@HeikoS	there is the preamble
@drwiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/sphinxdoc/doc/cookbook/source/conf.py#L64
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/sphinxdoc/doc/cookbook/source/conf.py#L31
@drwiking	this shoudl be generated from somewhere
@drwiking	do not hardcode version there :)
@HeikoS	drwiking: yep, its on my list
@HeikoS	can you make that? :)
@HeikoS	but latex first
@drwiking	no idea wtf is this :)))
@drwiking	python shit
@HeikoS	so it is possible to select mathjax
@HeikoS	http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/math.html#module-sphinx.ext.mathjax
@drwiking	ok and the problem is custom math expressions?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	need to give mathjax these commands somehow
@HeikoS	but I want to do this globally, and not specify them in every cookbook page seperately
@HeikoS	and the png thing has an option for that, mathjax extension has not
@HeikoS	quick an dirty solution
@HeikoS	but also can be changed later so I used that for now
@drwiking	mmm
@drwiking	how the hell do you generate this cookbook?
@drwiking	can u give me like 3 liner help
@drwiking	so i dont ahve to waste time
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	drwiking: sure
@HeikoS	in feature branch
@HeikoS	make cookbook
@HeikoS	but there is cmake option to enable it
@HeikoS	and it has some dependencies, if not installed, cmake wont generate the cookbook target
@drwiking	ok
@drwiking	what is the flag?
@drwiking	for cmake?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :feature/sphinxdoc * 07cf0ef / CMakeLists.txt,doc/CMakeLists.txt: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/07cf0ef01aa51aa5133851ce510a1f408887a501
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: rename cmake flag to build_cookbook
@HeikoS	BUILD_COOKBOOK now
@HeikoS	but yes
@HeikoS	sorry about names I wanted to change for a while
@HeikoS	not sure about the make logic
@HeikoS	for now, need BUILD_META_EXAMPLES=One and BUILD_COOKBOOK=On
@HeikoS	if only one is on or dependencies not met, it doesnt try to build them
@drwiking	mm
@drwiking	but then with
@drwiking	wait
@drwiking	why doesn't the cmake fial
@drwiking	fail
@HeikoS	I thought it might be nicer to not fail?
@HeikoS	since its optional
@drwiking	i mean if you explicitly specify
@drwiking	that you want ON
@drwiking	then you should fail
@HeikoS	thing is I put it on by default
@HeikoS	think that should be off and fail if dependency not met?
@drwiking	yes
@drwiking	anyhow lemme see
@drwiking	what is this ply?
@HeikoS	ok will do later
@HeikoS	a parser
@HeikoS	fast one
@HeikoS	to generate meta examples
@HeikoS	the native python one is slow as f***
@drwiking	ok but that's the package name?
@HeikoS	python-ply
@drwiking	python?
@drwiking	jesus
@drwiking	again?
@drwiking	why no antlr
@drwiking	or something
@drwiking	nevermind
@drwiking	moving along
@HeikoS	many reasons ...
@drwiking	so pip install ply ?
@HeikoS	but whatever
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	or apt-get install python-ply
@HeikoS	thats what I did not docker image
@HeikoS	and apt-get install sphinx
@drwiking	anything else?
@HeikoS	see here:https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/configs/Dockerfile#L25
@drwiking	bibtex?!
@drwiking	who uses bibtex
@drwiking	i mean at least biber
@drwiking	if referencing in latex
@HeikoS	drwiking: like everyone I know including google scholar
@drwiking	oh the motherfucking
@HeikoS	but doesnt matter here
@drwiking	fucking bibtex fuck
@drwiking	doens't recognize
@drwiking	that i have swig
@HeikoS	drwiking: hey I gotta go now.
@drwiking	k
@HeikoS	drwiking: with all these things, feel free to improve, this is a draft and I wanted to keep moving so sometimes compromise
@drwiking	make what?

@drwiking	how do i make make?
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	make cookbook
@HeikoS	should do it
@HeikoS	drwiking: btw the bibtex thing needs to be changed before we get students to send pages, as we dont want to touch them again
@HeikoS	basically want to get it to a state where we can accept new cookbook pages without every having to touch them again
@HeikoS	we can do changes such as global config later, since we dont need to touch all the files again
@HeikoS	got it built?
@HeikoS	drwiking: ?
@drwiking	hahaha no
@drwiking	this is a shit
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	but ok i'll look into it
@HeikoS	it works on travis, so you can go from there, and improve from there
@HeikoS	running now, see you!
@drwiking	ttyl
@drwiking	(facepalm) WARNING: LaTeX command 'latex' cannot be run (needed for math display), check the pngmath_latex setting

@drwiking	HeikoS: have u checked this b4 https://breathe.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
@HeikoS	drwiking: no, got a tldr for me?
@drwiking	doxygen output -> sphinx
@HeikoS	drwiking: to to replace our doxygen ?
@HeikoS	and integrate with the cookbook?
@HeikoS	sphinx
@drwiking	btw the style of this sphinx is hoooooorririiiiibbbbbbleee
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	drwiking: easy to change :)
@HeikoS	drwiking: hey can I use this: https://github.com/ivansafrin/Polycode/blob/master/CMake/FindPythonModule.cmake
@drwiking	yeah i know just saying
@HeikoS	drwiking: or should I have seperate Find*.cmake for different modules?
@drwiking	mmm you can
@HeikoS	trying to clean up what I ded
@HeikoS	whats the best way?
@drwiking	check if cmake 3.x has something
@HeikoS	google said no
@drwiking	or ask besser82
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	ok so HeikoS
@drwiking	here you go
@drwiking	http://trafaret.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html
@drwiking	care to comment? :)
@drwiking	this is the direct result of dynamic language
@drwiking	when people realise that using dynamic variables
@drwiking	can actually hurt :)
@drwiking	so their answer is
@drwiking	start using 'validators'
@drwiking	;))))
@HeikoS	eeeeehm
@drwiking	where is lisitsyn when it's time to trashtalk :))))
@drwiking	HeikoS: yes/ :)
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	no like? :)
@HeikoS	drwiking: haha I do similar stuff in my research code to ensure type safety ;) ;)
@drwiking	it's a fine piece of engineering there
@drwiking	yeah fuck i mean
@drwiking	man
@HeikoS	ah man
@drwiking	tha tmeans that it's a shit tool :)
@HeikoS	ridiculous
@HeikoS	I dont want to know how it is calling this thing in a loop
@drwiking	i mean it's like back in 1970s
@drwiking	when starting to define schemas
@drwiking	for dbs
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	btw
@drwiking	c++11
@drwiking	very nice :)
@drwiking	you should give it a go
@drwiking	many of your annoyance is gooooone
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	I want to use shogun
@drwiking	or of course start using haskell
@drwiking	or scala
@drwiking	:)
@HeikoS	since I dont want to start maintaining another build of c++
@drwiking	haskell is very ncie
 lisitsyn	wazup
@HeikoS	just want shoung to allow me to just care compile unit test my own class
@HeikoS	saw the suake3 in haskell? :)
@HeikoS	quake
@drwiking	noup
@HeikoS	check it out
@HeikoS	pretty awesonme
@drwiking	heheh :)
@drwiking	lisitsyn: so here you go
@drwiking	today's favourite for me http://trafaret.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html
 lisitsyn	meh
@drwiking	no like? :)
 lisitsyn	drwiking: moar boilerplate?
@drwiking	hahahahah
@drwiking	good stuff
@drwiking	it's for sure has function annotation
@drwiking	and it'll do it on function call
@drwiking	@input(a.isInt, b.isArray)
 lisitsyn	if I wanted to define types I'd write that in java
 lisitsyn	:D
@drwiking	def k(a, b):
@drwiking	:)))
@drwiking	well but see
@drwiking	python people dont ever want to leave the magical python world
@drwiking	they'll use that for everything
@drwiking	:)))
@drwiking	man have u seen ever the multiprocessing stack in python
@drwiking	:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 lisitsyn	oh multiprocessing is a curse
@drwiking	i think somebody was on mushroom when was writing that
 lisitsyn	I give up when it comes to threading stuff
@drwiking	:DDDDD
@drwiking	that's too complicated i think for py people
@drwiking	anyways
@drwiking	in python
@drwiking	everything is SYNCROHNIZED :)
@drwiking	(GIL)
@drwiking	man i could write a book
@drwiking	about theses things
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	ok mathjax :)
@drwiking	fuck i mean sometimes the boilerplate we have for shogun :)
@drwiking	why cannot we just have CODE
@drwiking	:D
 lisitsyn	what code?
@drwiking	the c++ code
@drwiking	if u now how to read it you'll be able to use it
@drwiking	if not then anyways it's not for you :)
@drwiking	easy :>
 lisitsyn	uhmm
 lisitsyn	not sure
@drwiking	hehehe
 lisitsyn	we were like that
 lisitsyn	and sklearn wins
@drwiking	i know
@drwiking	but man
@drwiking	of course
@drwiking	svm.fit
@drwiking	svm.predict
@drwiking	WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@drwiking	i'm a datascientist
@drwiking	:)
@drwiking	done
@drwiking	:>
@drwiking	running time: who cares
@drwiking	memory consumption: never cared
@drwiking	and u cannot beat that with a c++ lib
@drwiking	because you'll always have tha tone person
@drwiking	who'll make a call and that'll blow up the thing
@drwiking	in python everyhing is managed
@drwiking	even the runtime :)
 lisitsyn	drwiking: well your employee tries to make it even easier than fit/predict :D
 lisitsyn	employer*
@drwiking	:DDDD
@drwiking	*CLICK*
@drwiking	btw
@drwiking	shouldn't we smarten up one of the bots
@drwiking	to streamline here the stackoverflow questions?
@drwiking	i mean because who's reading that reguralirly?
 lisitsyn	to irc?
@drwiking	yeah
@drwiking	wooohooo
@drwiking	i knew it
@drwiking	look at this beuty

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok good
@HeikoS	meta examples come with a python requirement though

@HeikoS	besser82: true but not this particular package
@besser82	I c
@besser82	HeikoS, which one is required?
@HeikoS	besser82: python-ply or python-pyparsing
@besser82	good to know; we have both in Fedora, so I don't need to pkg it
