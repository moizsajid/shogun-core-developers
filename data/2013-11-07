@iglesiasg	100% voted, cool
@iglesiasg	however I think there are bad news
@iglesiasg	since we have to wait until the voting period expires
@iglesiasg	which is one week... :O

@iglesiasg	yeah, I agree.. it is super stupid
@iglesiasg	my bad that I didn't test that properly before setting it to one week
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well I guess in real live you never have 100%
 sonne|work	I mean w/i 24 hrs
@iglesiasg	yeah indeed
@iglesiasg	this only happens around CS geeks like us :D

@iglesiasg	:)
 lisitsyn1	most of us are online all the time
 lisitsyn1	I react to email in 5 mins usually :D
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: what's up with your thesis?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, writing writing
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, soon to be finished I think
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, well, actually today I am working more on preparing plots to show the results correctly than writing writing
 lisitsyn1	iglesiasg: I see
@wiking	asdf
* wiking likes more and more flask and alike stuff
@wiking	python is getting great in web containers
 thoralf	Ehrm.  Everyone voted, but no results?
 thoralf	That's crazy.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Did you file a bug report? ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, actually no
@iglesiasg	but I guess I should tell them something
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I would do, but I didn't start the poll. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, yeah sure. I will take care of it today :)

 parijat	hi, i wanted to add a unit test for kmeans,  so I added a new .cc file in tests/unit/ . Thats it. Is there anything else that needs to be done?
@iglesiasg	parijat, I just read the unit test you pasted on gist
@iglesiasg	parijat, use pointers for the CDenseFeatures and the CEuclideanDistance objects better
@iglesiasg	to avoid issues when reference counting is used internally e.g. when the features are passed to the distance in the constructor
@iglesiasg	parijat, also, I think you forgot to free memory
@iglesiasg	parijat, and what about the ifdef HAVE_PTHREAD, etc?
@iglesiasg	is that necessary or used somewhere?
@iglesiasg	otherwise it looks good :)
@iglesiasg	it is good that you could make the unit test

 parijat	sorry I lost connection
 parijat	ok I will make the changes.
@iglesiasg	sounds good!

 parijat	@iglesiasg: hi, based on our last discussion I have made some changes and updated the gist. Please have a look at it again. I removed pthreads. its not used anywhere I checked. I have also cleaned up memory at the end using SG_UNREF
@iglesiasg	parijat, cool!
@iglesiasg	parijat, let me have a look
@iglesiasg	parijat, but let's use for the upcoming times a pull request like you did last week ;)
@iglesiasg	parijat, so when you do get of Shogun objects, like get_lhs
@iglesiasg	you are likely to need to free it afterwards
@iglesiasg	since a get increments the reference count of the object
 parijat	ok sure. actually I wasnt sure if the unit test was at all correct. so i thought I should show someone first
@iglesiasg	you can always check in the code of the getter of course
@iglesiasg	so this would apply for distance->get_lhs()
 parijat	ok. I will have to free it inside the loop only right?
@iglesiasg	yep
@iglesiasg	parijat, anyway, do you know valgrind?
@iglesiasg	parijat, it is a very good tool to detect memory leaks (when you forget to free stuff)
@iglesiasg	since getting leaks may get subtle quickly with the code

 parijat	nope :( but if can try to learn
@iglesiasg	sure
 parijat	ok there are lots of tutorial in the internet. let me see if i can learn it! :)
