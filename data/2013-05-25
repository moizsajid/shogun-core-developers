 pickle27	sonney2k: I can replicate the bug on my system, is it possible the bug is in how its tested and not qda itself?
 pickle27	sonney2k: because I can run the example and if I run with debug on the alg finishes before that error is thrown
 pickle27	sonney2k: like I see the results and it looks good and then that error gets printed

@sonney2k	gsomix, hey there! how is it going?
@sonney2k	pickle27, well lets try
 pickle27	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	pickle27, nope
@sonney2k	it is the example
 gsomix	sonney2k, hey. I'm working now. how are you?
 pickle27	sonney2k: does it crash on your machine?
 pickle27	sonney2k: only the test crashes for me
@sonney2k	pickle27, yes but test only runs the example and then serializes the returned outputs
 pickle27	sonney2k: could it be how the results are serialized?
@sonney2k	pickle27, I dont' think so - only difference I can think of is that there is a rng seed set for the test
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay I am going to try and ran valgrind on it later this aft and see what happens
 pickle27	sonney2k: try and figure where the problem is, I have some ideas

 gsomix	sonney2k, around?
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes?
 gsomix	sonney2k, why isn't CSGString referenced?
@sonney2k	gsomix, argh it is on TODO
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, started this at some point but reverted everything when he was almost done
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no it wasn't done
@lisitsyn	I was dying deep into that
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.

 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, I should write getline reader for generic CSGString,isn't it?
 gsomix	I mean, LineReader should be a templated class.
@sonney2k	gsomix, no just for char
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.

@lisitsyn	sonney2k: did you know running opencl code on say your CPU is faster than running some serial code?
@lisitsyn	I mean even CPUs are faster with that (not only GPUs)
@lisitsyn	pickle27: hey
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey!
@lisitsyn	pickle27: I am just curious if you are up for some more english check ;)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: might be able to help out, when do you need it for?
@lisitsyn	no idea :)
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@85.26.234.225] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
@lisitsyn	actually just a short readme
@lisitsyn	but it will be seen by all reviewers - that's why I want it look not that russian
@lisitsyn	pickle27: I realize how good its to have a native speaker around :D
@lisitsyn	may be our doc will look less chigermrussisch
@lisitsyn	as there are chinese germans and russians with their own flavour of english :)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: haha glad to help out
@lisitsyn	pickle27: in your mail
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I'll get that back to you sometime soon
@lisitsyn	pickle27: owe you a beer :)
