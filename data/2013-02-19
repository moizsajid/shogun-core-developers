@sonney2k	n4nd0, any news on the web app?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I took a look yesterday to django_evolution
 n4nd0	but had an oral exam today
 n4nd0	I will probably be back to it tomorrow
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am reading now about this type of warning
 n4nd0	../../shogun/mathematics/Math.h:248: Warning 509: Overloaded method shogun::CMath::sqrt(float64_t) effectively ignored,
 n4nd0	../../shogun/mathematics/Math.h:242: Warning 509: as it is shadowed by shogun::CMath::sqrt(float32_t).
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I believe it is just caused by SWIG
@sonney2k	n4nd0, lua?
@sonney2k	but better focus on the website...
@sonney2k	we need to send out some official announcement rather soon
 n4nd0	I thought we wanted warnings down to zero by this week! :S
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I saw it on nightly_default http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/287/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20(602)/text
 n4nd0	it doesn't say anything about lua
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well check http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/287/steps/compile/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	there it says lua
 n4nd0	yeah... I just realized that
 n4nd0	it appears after swig -lua
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thanks!
