@iglesiasg	that is just the README.md
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Viktor Gal :feature/CMake * b180b08 / / (3 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/b180b084be7d3b1b7d461a6556da477ad7421d80
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: On the way to fix octave_modular interface
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah :(
@iglesiasg	hushell, in the clone statement?
 hushell	iglesiasg: so the clone_MAPInfeence unit-test failed I think
 hushell	yep
 hushell	IIRC, clone_ptype failed
@iglesiasg	hushell, so it looks like you are not initializing the members in the constructors of CMAPInference, right?
@iglesiasg	for instance after the default constructor
@iglesiasg	well, not after, in the default constructor
 hushell	okay, I see in default constructor the pointer member has not been initialized
 hushell	let me try to fix this

@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah so it is nicely possible. We just use README.md and then have links to README_DEVELOPER.md via https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes
@iglesiasg	hushell, well none of the members is initialized, right?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah this would be cool
@HeikoS	then its synched *and*  looks nice/easy to access
@sonney2k	HeikoS, etc ... not really a wiki though
@sonney2k	you can only edit the text document from git
@HeikoS	sonney2k: well a list of things/links would already be good
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah .... true
@sonney2k	HeikoS, btw doxygen will also render the README.md etc pages - it also understands markdown syntax
@sonney2k	so we could have it on the github front page and in our doxygen doc
@sonney2k	just editing a single file
 shogun-buildbot	build #1472 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1472  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 hushell	iglesiasg: hmm, a big mistake, now I set them to NULL initially
@iglesiasg	hushell, did it fix it?
 hushell	iglesiasg: compiling
 hushell	iglesiasg: you could close the PR, I'll send new ones
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I would just rename log_pdf to log_pdf_single or so to fix this
@iglesiasg	hushell, all right
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but why is it that SGVector sometimes goes to RealVector and sometimes to DoubleMatrix in java?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I renamed that thing already
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, cool!
@iglesiasg	also the other error that gave problems in java_modular?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no clue

@sonney2k	HeikoS, and the error is gone or?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: dont know but should
@HeikoS	name is different now
@sonney2k	HeikoS, seems not http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1472/steps/compile%20java_modular/logs/stdio
@iglesiasg	I cam compile and check
@iglesiasg	no need then
@HeikoS	this error mkaes no sense
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, HeikoS, it compiled fine there this time
@HeikoS	buildbot weirdness?
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build "deb3 - modular_interfaces" --branch=develop
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 38m22s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	lets see
@HeikoS	whoooooooooo
@HeikoS	we now have a working script that runs and stores and ipython notebook
@HeikoS	wiking:  ^
@wiking	\o/
@sonney2k	HeikoS, where?
@sonney2k	how ?
@sonney2k	more details!
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/minrk/6160067
@HeikoS	I got in contact with one of the devs
@HeikoS	he updated the old ones for us :)
@sonney2k	very good
@HeikoS	just tried it, and it works
 hushell	iglesiasg: Thanks! clone is good after initialization :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, good to know
@HeikoS	so we should integrate this into old system but also cmake
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so how would we want that to work?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: my idea is: we have a dir with couple of notebooks
@sonney2k	run it on buildbot in nightly_default?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes
@HeikoS	it runs them all and stores resulting ones, and uploads those to our website
@sonney2k	and then have the python code run to check stuff works and then put this on website somewhere?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	and then on our website, we have a manually created site that lists all of the examples in some order
@HeikoS	and provides links to the rendered version
@HeikoS	via http://nbviewer.ipython.org/
@HeikoS	http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/herrstrathmann.de
@HeikoS	pretty easy to use
@sonney2k	HeikoS, hmhh doesn't work here
@sonney2k	I always get the error
@sonney2k	    km = KernelManager()
@sonney2k	NameError: global name 'KernelManager' is not defined
@HeikoS	sonney2k: it only works on current git ipython
@HeikoS	you have 0.13
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@HeikoS	but its very easy to install
@HeikoS	just clone and run setup.py build
@HeikoS	takes 2 s
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I am having a look at the GaussianDistribution unit test that hangs on my machine (and maybe in travis too). It happens in an Eigen statement. What version of eigen do you use?
@HeikoS	then sudo setup.py install
@iglesiasg	it looks pretty weird
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah I had issues with old eigen version
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I have 3.1
@HeikoS	which was released last year
@iglesiasg	aaham I see
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, did you just download it from the webpage?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ubuntu
@iglesiasg	mmm I have that one too
@iglesiasg	HeikoS,  PPA?
@HeikoS	gnhcyj8ju!
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	thats my root password
@sonney2k	https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
@iglesiasg	hahahaha
@HeikoS	can I delete that somehow from the logs?
@sonney2k	lets all ssh to HeikoS machine!
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, better change it NOW
@HeikoS	just did
@HeikoS	ah annoying
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: just because I opened synaptic ;)
@HeikoS	3.1.0~beta1-1ubuntu1
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sorry that I caused that :(
@HeikoS	dont worry
@HeikoS	too late
@HeikoS	still at work
@HeikoS	so I will go home now :)
@iglesiasg	dpkg -l | grep next time
@sonney2k	wiking, when will you have a nice uplink?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I like synaptic :)
@iglesiasg	hehe ok :)
@iglesiasg	maybe we should update travis' Eigen as well
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes that would be good
@iglesiasg	I have the feeling it is continuously dying in there
@HeikoS	I got problems with the old old version
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ok the thing runs now
@HeikoS	but -- cmake will fix that
@HeikoS	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	HeikoS, how do I get it on a website?
@iglesiasg	cool then
@HeikoS	you need to have a fixed http link to the file
@HeikoS	so upload to shogun - server directory and pass that link to the nbviwer
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ahh so we can just use the nbviewer then?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	then we need to generate a little script that  creates a website in some fashion
@sonney2k	which should I upload the run_saved.ipynb?
@HeikoS	but I think I would do this by hand, i.e. we have a growing list of notebooks somewhere for each category
@sonney2k	or the one in our dir?
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  yes
@HeikoS	no the saved
@HeikoS	can also be deleted afterwards
@sonney2k	what is the difference?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: the saved one contains output
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  we should not store output in the notebooks
@HeikoS	oh there is also a script for removing output
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/minrk/3719849
@HeikoS	which we should call on the existing ones to clean up
@HeikoS	sonney2k: if we have this list of notebooks, we could then generate a website based on a template
@HeikoS	that inserts notebooks into categories or whatever
@HeikoS	like GSoC 2013
@HeikoS	ok I really gotta go now
@HeikoS	see you!

 hushell	iglesiasg: Do you know why after git commit --amend, git push always say error: failed to push some refs, and I have to use --force
-!- foulwall [~user@110.16.165.220] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
@iglesiasg	hushell, it tries to prevent you from rewriting past history that is already written in there
 hushell	iglesiasg: so --force is correct?
@iglesiasg	hushell, in this case, it is fine
@iglesiasg	hushell, another possible thing is to delete the remote branch and push again
@iglesiasg	although I suspect that git push --force might do something like that
 hushell	iglesiasg: hmm, I prefer to keep every branch currently
@iglesiasg	hushell, you delete it, and then you push again
@iglesiasg	without doing --force
 hushell	iglesiasg: do you think will be okay to put IGNORE_IN_CLASSLIST in front of CMosek?
 hushell	so it will not be in the clone test
@iglesiasg	hushell, yeah sure
@iglesiasg	it is crashing there?
 hushell	still
@iglesiasg	oh yeah, I never looked at it at the end
@iglesiasg	sorry
 hushell	no matter
 hushell	I am curious how you prevent LMNNImpl from class_list
@iglesiasg	hushell, why did you have to remove const in get_factor_type?
@iglesiasg	hushell, you mean why is LMNNImpl not included in SWIG interfaces?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I know this is because you add a line in modshogun_ignores.i
 hushell	but they are not it base/class_list.cpp
 hushell	but you do not put IGNORE_IN_CLASSLIST in front
 hushell	iglesiasg: let me check the get_factor_type
@iglesiasg	hushell, maybe because LMNNImpl is not a SGObject? I have no idea really
@iglesiasg	hushell, I am just curious about it :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, and btw, LMNNImpl does not need to be in modshogun_ignores.i, I just don't include it anyway in interfaces/modular/*.i
@iglesiasg	hushell, it seems  that our SWIG is configured not to compile everything by default, so I just didn't include LMNNImpl anywhere there
@iglesiasg	just LMNN
@iglesiasg	all right, time to get to the bed

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix renaming also in unit test
@wiking	sonne|work: yes
@wiking	sonne|work: he should do the eigen3 fetcher for cmake
@wiking	let's fucking freeze *now* hacking with travis and ./configure
@wiking	plz
@wiking	otherwise i'll never catch up
 sonne|work	wiking: well merge your stuff and we can help
@wiking	sonne|work: the branch is freely writeable by any developer
 sonne|work	wiking: yes but converting the build bots to use cmake will make the difference
@wiking	sonne|work: why?
@wiking	sonne|work: i mean now not even travis runs fine
@wiking	so why would be good now to even add the buildbots
@wiking	i prefer to fix at least the compilation on travis
@wiking	so at least that works
 sonne|work	what is wrong with travis?
@wiking	RModular, RubyModular, PythonModular (python3)
@wiking	and OctaveModular
@wiking	in these builds
@wiking	there's still something wrong
@wiking	not test wise
@wiking	cmake wise...
@wiking	either some env variable is missing or something
 sonne|work	wiking: I am not talking about travis
@wiking	cmake
@wiking	mostly these are problems with cmake
 sonne|work	wiking: I want to convert the buildbots to slowly use this
@wiking	but can be seen that it's broken on travis
 sonne|work	first the libshogun based ones
@iglesiasg	wiking, Travis build freezes all the time because there is a test that does not finish with the version of Eigen in Travis
 sonne|work	then static and test
@wiking	iglesiasg: ok good
@iglesiasg	wiking, not because of the change I am trying to do... but whatever
@iglesiasg	I am actually trying to fix that
@wiking	iglesiasg: idontcare ./configure and .travis.yml IS DO NOT FUCKING TOUCH IT
@iglesiasg	yeah yeah.. I just said whatever
@wiking	sonne|work: either everything or nothing
@iglesiasg	let's get more and more commits inside
@iglesiasg	without seeing what travis said >(
@wiking	sonne|work: you cant have cmake libshogun but python_modular by ./configure
 sonne|work	wiking: no that won't work
 sonne|work	small steps
 sonne|work	why not?
@wiking	sonne|work: sorry but there has been just too much changes
@wiking	there will be missing files ets
@wiking	etc
@wiking	like i dont have anymore shogun/lib/config.h in feature/CMake barnch
@wiking	*branch
@wiking	that's like one major problem you'll start having...
 sonne|work	wiking: what do you do instead of config.h then?
@wiking	sonne|work: i just have a config.h.in
@wiking	and then cmake will generate it for you
 sonne|work	yeah but where is the issue?
@wiking	but not in src/shogun/lib/config.h
 sonne|work	where then?
@wiking	it'll be in build/src/shogun/lib/config.h
@wiking	or something similar
@wiking	i cannot tell by heart
@wiking	anyhow... cmake is still not ready
 sonne|work	but that is not a problem then
@wiking	it needs fucking tweaking on cmake + travis side
@wiking	to get it at least to some level
@wiking	once that's done i can do the rebase
 sonne|work	well cmake with libshogun  is or not?
 sonne|work	my migration plan would be
 sonne|work	1) get libshogun & cmake to run on buildbot
 sonne|work	2) get static interfaces work with cmake
 sonne|work	3) do modular
 sonne|work	and then one by one move the buildbot stuff over
@wiking	sonne|work: i dont have any static in cmake
 sonne|work	we cannot stop development just because we are transitioning
 sonne|work	well it is trivial to add when you already have (parts of) modular

@wiking	sonne|work: well then good luck cherrypicking
 sonne|work	so the fixes iglesiasg is doing make sense
@wiking	from the feature/CMake branch
@wiking	sonne|work: no it doesn't because it's not right anyways...
@wiking	but ok
 sonne|work	wiking: well just explain what the issue is then
 sonne|work	I mean config.h.in is not an issue
 sonne|work	it could just be there
@iglesiasg	wiking, it is not right agree. But it is not like I am trying to fuck up your work doing it
 sonne|work	wiking: I might be missing sth but you need to explain more then
@wiking	iglesiasg: a) it's not correct the way you try to do it b) instead of tryign to fix that you are doing wrong, use that energy and gimme a cmake patch that automagically downloads eigen3 (the version you want)
@wiking	iglesiasg: it's not that hard, i've even showed an example yesterday
@iglesiasg	wiking, b) sure. I am glad to help you with that
@iglesiasg	wiking, a) it is in the same way you did the gtest and other things in there, it is just not working yet because I got some details wrong
@wiking	iglesiasg: it's not the same...
@iglesiasg	wiking, about b, when is it going to be CMake ready? Even if I do this patch? One day, two days, one week?
@iglesiasg	wiking, what do we do until then? continue merging all the stuff when travis is hanging up on it?
@wiking	one of the reason is because it's not working. if it'd be the same it would be working or?
@iglesiasg	wiking, did you read the part that I got some details wrong?
@iglesiasg	wiking, the idea is the same (I think)
@iglesiasg	wiking, wget, unpack, give the flags to configure
@iglesiasg	wiking, I am getting some directory wrong yeah, and I actually think it is a stupid mistake
@iglesiasg	but whatever
@iglesiasg	IMHO I don't think the mistake I have done is stopping you from seeing your changes in cmake
@iglesiasg	just check the build history in travis and see it by yourself

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Travis: switch to virtualenv and pip for python builds
@iglesiasg	but I mean, I can live without that change... it doesn't pay off for me to have this argument due to it, so I just skip it
@wiking	iglesiasg: i see it as a double waste time if you try to fix this
@wiking	iglesiasg: as the energy u use for fixing it could be used much better and it would be more beneficial in a long run
@wiking	but even in a short one
@wiking	like within a day...
@wiking	we are not using travis the right way
@wiking	and that's mostly my fault
@wiking	as i did it
@wiking	but now following this path is purely wrong

@wiking	sonne|work lisitsyn iglesiasg what should we do with external projects, should be bundled them within shogun, i.e. if one chooses to have a library compiled by/with shogun's cmake should that be part of shogun and ship it in <prefix>/include/shogun/third_party/... ? see the case of eigen
@iglesiasg	what is easiest for the user, which I guess is to bundle them
@wiking	iglesiasg: imho bundling

@wiking	iglesiasg: so ship all the headers under shogun/third_party/ and static link the library with libshogun.so
@wiking	any objections ^ sonne|work ?
@wiking	iglesiasg: u use ccache right?
@iglesiasg	yes
@wiking	iglesiasg: is the clean compilation faster for you?
@wiking	iglesiasg: i.e. when your ccache is empty?
@wiking	then w/o ccache
@wiking	*than
@iglesiasg	wiking, I think that clean compilation is the same
@iglesiasg	I have not timed it though
@wiking	iglesiasg: i hoped that in case of EIGEN3 present it would be a bit faster
@wiking	wiking@snf-77841:~$ ccache -s

@wiking	sonne|work: bundled third party libs
@wiking	sonne|work: i.e. we want to have at least eigen 3.1.2 for shogun... if it's not available in the distro we could give the user the option to tell shogun's make to download and use 3.1.2 eigen... and we could ship this in third_party/...
 sonne|work	wiking: but why ship it if cmake downloads it?
-!- lambday [67157c4f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.124.79] has joined #shogun
@wiking	sonne|work: well even if it downloads it we have to install it somewhere
@wiking	sonne|work: and i dont really think it's a good idea to install it to the system
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh you mean we download and then extract compile somewhere
 sonne|work	yeah sure create the folder third_party then and do all that in there
 sonne|work	(on-the-fly)
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah but when installing?
@wiking	sonne|work: this is exactly the problem of eigen
@wiking	it's just a bunch of headers
@wiking	lets say somebody not only wants to run some c++ examples but as well compile them... i.e. he needs all the shogun headers
 sonne|work	wiking: errm we don't need eigen3 stuff installed
@wiking	hence we need to ship all the headers somehow
 sonne|work	wiking: he will only need shogun headers
 sonne|work	no eigen
@wiking	sonne|work: ?
 sonne|work	wiking: we have no eigen requirements in headers!
 sonne|work	so only needed at compile time
@wiking	sonne|work: examples/undocumented/libshogun/converter_diffusionmaps.cpp
@wiking	why is there HAVE_EIGEN3 then?
 sonne|work	well libshogun won't hae CDiffusionMaps if EIGEN3 was not availabe at compile time
@wiking	and if available?
@wiking	that's what i mean...
@wiking	we supply eigen3 with cmake during compilation... then ship that libshogun.so/a
@wiking	and what if somebody will want to develop for that libshogun a binary that needs CDiffusionMaps for example
@wiking	he should be able to do it as it's in libshogun....
 sonne|work	wiking: then he can just use it with libshogun
 sonne|work	wiking: OK?
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm i dont see that it wont start erroring with the #includes of shogun but lets see
@wiking	unless we dont ship the eigen headers with shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: but you would agree that if no header file in shogun uses eigen3 that we are fine?
@wiking	sonne|work: indeed
@wiking	if we can do the opaque shit then it should b fine
 sonne|work	wiking: exaclty
 sonne|work	that is the plan
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then i'll just download and compile shogun with that... and dont add the headers into the install target...
 sonne|work	we should somehow define clear interfaces and hide all the implementation details to the extent possible
 sonne|work	wiking: what is problematic would be e.g libglpk.so etc
 sonne|work	these we would somehow need
 sonne|work	at runtime
@wiking	sonne|work: statically compile within libshogun.so?
@wiking	i mean s/within/into/g
 sonne|work	didn't manage to do that
@wiking	mmm ok i'll try
 sonne|work	suspect that this will be 200MB in size
@wiking	but now i realised that i completly fucked up the whole travis config
@wiking	we were using it veeeeryt wrong
@wiking	there are already precompiled envs for like all python and ruby versions
@wiking	and as well java
@wiking	one doesn't need to apt-get it
@wiking	just it needs some extra care in the config file of traviss

 thoralf	One feature hashing question: Is there a way to (a priori/posteriori) estimate a "good" number of dimensions for hashing?
 thoralf	For example: Having trained classifiers x and y with hashed features of dimensions d_x and d_y...
 thoralf	Or a measure which tells when the hashed solution is somehow optimal/a good trade-off between time/space/accuracy?
-!- gsomix_ [~gsomix@95.67.140.176] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	thoralf: not really. I guess your best bet is to increase hash size slowly and then you should observe a plateau at some point

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hello, are you here?
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: Is there an implementation of functions like logistic sigmoid, linear function etc. in shogun (I think it is, but I can't find it)?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: at least I remember some discussions in chat or email regarding logistic sigmoid function..
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: hmm I don't really know if there is something modular for that
 lisitsyn	but that's easy to implement right?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I've found only this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/Function.h, and this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/evaluation/DifferentiableFunction.h (strange that these files seem to be 'disconnected' from each other)
 lisitsyn	hehe yeah
 lisitsyn	they are both from GP
 lisitsyn	but developed by different people
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I will need basic interface for differentiable function - like operator() (float64_t x) and derivative(float64_t x) functions, and the existing DifferentiableFunction interface seems to be a bit overcomplicated, while Function interface lacks derivative method:)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: what is it for?
 vgorbati	vgorbati: neural networks. A neuron has its activation function, the most used are logistic sigmoid, tanh and linear, but there can be others, like polynomial etc. I thought, that the same interface for them all will be a good approach
 vgorbati	oops
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: ah just add a new class you need then
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: then there will be 3 different classes for functions:) Ok, I will name my class 'ActivationFunction' :)
 lisitsyn	that's ok I think
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: even with functions, that seem to have pretty accurate definition - it's really hard to make a class suitable for all:)
 lisitsyn	differentiable functio is some model selection related stuff
 lisitsyn	quite complicated

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add BUNDLE_EIGEN and BUNDLE_JSON options
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: download compile as a bundle both of the libraries during compilation of shogun
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Dedicated to Fernando
@wiking	ok so i think cmake is done
@sonney2k	wiking, then merge man
@wiking	lets wait for the travis output
@wiking	at least
@wiking	but basically from now on we could bundle the whole f*ing dependency into libshogun
@wiking	oh noooo... jinja2 is missing..

@wiking	we need an eigen mirror in the us... travis build servers are there and my server where currently the eigen source resides is in eu...hence slow download
@sonney2k	gsomix_, ping ping ping
@sonney2k	gsomix_, something is wrong and I cannot figure it out
@sonney2k	gsomix_, the C_ORDER works almost but of the 92x92 matrix about 700 entries are wrong
@sonney2k	no idea why

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: change c/fortran conversion of csv file reader and convert gaussian kernel
@sonney2k	wiking, I have a server in the US
@wiking	sonney2k: can u put there this tar.bz2: http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.1.4.tar.bz2
@wiking	and give me the url
@sonney2k	wiking, I have to check first if I have anything running that can serve files
@wiking	doh /usr/bin/ld: ../../../third_party/libs/json/libjson-c.a(json_object.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.text' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
@wiking	../../../third_party/libs/json/libjson-c.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
@sonney2k	wiking, only some https stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, omfg why is it not compiled with -fPIC?
@wiking	sonney2k: dunno... i mean it's json which is not compiled.. but yeah i'm adding now the --with-pic for it's ./configure script
@wiking	sonney2k: i need that file on http://
@wiking	w/o ssl
@sonney2k	wiking, is ftp also fine?

@wiking	mmm we need to change the gmock/gtest version in order to support unit testing :P
@sonney2k	wiking, why that? What feature is it missing?
@wiking	/Users/wiking/shogun/build/GoogleMock/src/GoogleMock/gtest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h:499:13: fatal error: 'tr1/tuple' file not found
@wiking	#   include <tr1/tuple>  // NOLINT ^
@wiking	that's why
@wiking	it's fixed in gtest's repo
@wiking	but not in the 1.6.0 release
@wiking	which is not so surpriseing
@wiking	as it was released in 2011
@wiking	:
@wiking	:P
@sonney2k	wiking, try wget ftp://nn7.de/eigen3/3.1.4.tar.bz2
@sonney2k	wiking, urgs
@sonney2k	what is tr1/tuple?
@wiking	tr1 is pre c++11 ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, but where does this appear?
@sonney2k	I cannot find it in the shogun tree
@wiking	sonney2k: in gtest framework
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh it is inside gtest?
@sonney2k	wiking, so std=c++11 will fail?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	indeed
