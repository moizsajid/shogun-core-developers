 blackburn	sonney2k: the whole ice hockey russian team died in air accident
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14822582
@sonney2k	bad bad
@sonney2k	blackburn, should I add PCA and kPCA?
@sonney2k	in the summary?
@sonney2k	blackburn, staying calmn for > 1.5 hrs is enough condolence ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: sorry was away for some eat
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't think so, much of *PCA code is not my
@sonney2k	blackburn - please read http://shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc2011/entry.html
@sonney2k	OK
@sonney2k	tell me what I should improve / what I forgot
 blackburn	sonney2k: very nice
 blackburn	no idea what you missed
@sonney2k	blackburn, I got totally lost when writing it
@sonney2k	I realized that we did way too much for one GSoC ;-)
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is something really hard to write that, yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you think I should post it?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah why not, it looks very nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: soo?
@sonney2k	I am fighting
 blackburn	sonney2k: with?
@sonney2k	images not found no reason why
@sonney2k	blackburn, argh
@sonney2k	stupid me
@sonney2k	I was mixing up the shogun homepage with mine
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	now the blog is online
@sonney2k	https://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/category/blog/
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice. hope that will be interesting for normal folks
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think this is still too tough...
@sonney2k	but hey
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess *normal* one won't understand the beauty of https://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/media/images/svm/svm_interactive.png
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you planning to go through next gsoc?
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure
@sonney2k	we need good mentors though
@sonney2k	if all goes well I will be on paternal leave again next summer but I will have to take care of the kids all day
@sonney2k	so no way I can do as much as I did this year for gsoc
@sonney2k	on the other hand - we have an improved infrastructure now
@sonney2k	*much improved*
 blackburn	sonney2k: paternal leave?
@sonney2k	blackburn, taking care of kids for no money :
 blackburn	how long it is?
@sonney2k	)
@sonney2k	basically all summer
 blackburn	wow
@sonney2k	not clear yet though...
 blackburn	so you just leaving your job for summer?
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it true you can't make your kids stay at home alone?
 blackburn	in legal means
 blackburn	heard something like that
@sonney2k	ehh you shouldn't
@sonney2k	I mean if anything happens they can die
 blackburn	well I'm not about to do or not to do that :)
 blackburn	of course not
 blackburn	but what law says about it?
@sonney2k	they are just babies :)
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	common sense says don't do that
 blackburn	I'm asking because I heard that in germany it is illegal to get kids of <7year or so stay alone
@sonney2k	hard to believe
 blackburn	I guess it was a lie :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: if you want me to be a mentor recall I wouldn't have much time to work on shogun - would have to work on real job instead of it :)
@sonney2k	I don't mind you being a student again :)
@sonney2k	so I at least know that you do some work
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, question is what would be good topics?
@sonney2k	I mean one nice one would be a great shogun tutorial with some nice data sets illustrating the whole pipeline
@sonney2k	that would involve lots of documentation too
@sonney2k	others could still be c5.0 and other new ml algorithms like e.g. multiboost
@sonney2k	blackburn, look we are on the front page http://planet.debian.net/
 blackburn	sonney2k: we have enough time for thinking about that
@sonney2k	not soo much...
 blackburn	I think we will come up with something :)
