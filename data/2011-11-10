 blackburn	heiko: did you make progress on java?
 heiko	hi blackburn
 heiko	no :(
 blackburn	hi :0
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	okay lets make it
 heiko	kind of frustrating :(
 heiko	ok,
 blackburn	what is the error you get?
 heiko	so, make install wents through fine
 blackburn	but?
 blackburn	not found classes?
 heiko	java compile wont work
 heiko	yes
 heiko	I even tried in eclipse, by importing the jar files for shogun and jblas by hand
 blackburn	what is the dir you are trying to compile in?
 heiko	but still
 heiko	does not compile
 heiko	Lets go for this example first
 heiko	my pwd is shogun/src, just made make install
 heiko	now i want to compile an example
 heiko	are the commands you sent me up to date?
 heiko	export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jblas.jar:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular/shogun.jar:. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUNDIR/src/libshogun:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular
 heiko	because src/java_modular does not exists for example
 heiko	or blackburn, another question: I am trying to help madeleine with her memory leaks
 blackburn	sorry answering slowly (at job :)
 blackburn	okay
 heiko	but i dont really got a lot of time, i thought of just having a look but this is already taking too much time
 blackburn	paths are not up to date surely
 heiko	do you know if somebody else can help there? I mean the java interface is completely new to me, I just talked to her because of the modsel stuff, but now the topic has changed
 heiko	what about the guy who did the java interface?
 blackburn	let us consider this guy as me
 blackburn	cause baozeng disappeared completely I guess
 heiko	ok then :)
 heiko	well the problem is that MKL regression leaks
 heiko	however, there is an example
 blackburn	I can take this bug over
 heiko	does this work? i never checked it
 blackburn	me neither
 heiko	ok
 blackburn	it is chris' code, but I can check I think
 blackburn	in next few days
 heiko	would be cool, because I am currently getting crazy because of assignment deadlines getting closer and closer :D
 blackburn	heiko: so modsel stuff is answered already?
 heiko	yes, she cannot use it because she uses custom kernel matrices and these are currently not supported for modsel
 heiko	I will send you her code and data
 heiko	dropbox ok?
 blackburn	heiko: can you please send it by mail?
 heiko	33mb
 heiko	(the data)
 blackburn	not a problem
 heiko	ok then
 blackburn	I may lost the link cause now I'm at job using not my main machine :)
 heiko	ok :)
 blackburn	I just not tracked where problem morphed into leaking, not x-val
 blackburn	I thought x-val is leaking
 heiko	nono, she is doing it by hand now
 heiko	the x-val
 heiko	I will send you the emails
 blackburn	okay
 heiko	blackburn, google only accepts 25 mb i will have to split
 blackburn	oh okay
 blackburn	well you can send links to dropbox then
 heiko	ok
 heiko	ok just sent it
 heiko	i will also send you the mails she wrote
 blackburn	heiko: thanks
 blackburn	heiko: wow I never knew it is possible to share folders :D
 heiko	blackburn, no? yes this is a kind of nice feature
 heiko	using it to share book in university a lot
 blackburn	heiko: sure, I guess they've added it not so long ago
 blackburn	heiko: have you seen madeleine's photo? :D
 heiko	hehe, for sure :D
 blackburn	cutest shogun user I guess haha
 heiko	facebook has another one :) and yes I agree with you
 heiko	blackburn, thanks for taking it over, i will head to university now, already late
 blackburn	heiko: not a problem, you are not responsible for such bugs (while I am) :)
 blackburn	heiko: have a nice day
 heiko	same for you! byebye

 blackburn	sonne|work: have you applied MKL to anything?
 sonne|work	bah, heiko is always in this channel when I am not
 blackburn	sonne|work: it was easier to use IRC this summer, way more easier than now :)
 sonne|work	now you finally know how difficult it was for me to be *that* active while at work :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's crazy impossible if I was doing anything
 blackburn	I'm happy I have no important tasks now :)
 sonne|work	you have to work day and night...
 blackburn	sonne|work: so did you apply mkl to anything?
 blackburn	I have to test if it is leaking
 sonne|work	yes, splice site / tss recognition
 blackburn	was it working well? ;)
 blackburn	may be it is not mkl but java issue
 blackburn	madeleine told me that it is time-critical, so I'll try to examine it this evening

 blackburn	sonne|work: did you manage to compile shogun on desired platforms?
 sonne|work	desired platform?
 sonne|work	it works fine on debian/centos
 sonne|work	osx mostly too now (but haven't committed all patches)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'm thinking about release - that's why I am asking
 blackburn	I've done all the work on converters (I hope)
 sonne|work	I would love to get cygwin to work too and we still haven't moved all the .h -> .cpp
 sonne|work	e.g. in mathematics etc
 blackburn	sure
 sonne|work	yesterday I was fixing octave clang bugs ...
 sonne|work	anyways back to work
 blackburn	okay

 CIA-37	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r64569cd / src/configure : fix example failures under osx / vector lib detection - http://git.io/OJRsKQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: why custom kernel should be 32?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what?
@sonney2k	should be what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, things work on osx more or less
@sonney2k	at least octave, python and R work perfectly
@sonney2k	I couldn't test ruby because I didn't have the narray stuff and I am not sure how to install it
@sonney2k	same problem with java - didn't have jblas
@sonney2k	csharp and lua didn't work - weird crashes I cannot make sense of
@sonney2k	I am now going to boot windows - lets see how far we get...
@sonney2k	ahh btw we might finally get the buildbots next week :)
@sonney2k	booting windows now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	ehh
 blackburn	sorry was away
