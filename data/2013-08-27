 Heiko	Test
 sonne|work	Time zone: (GMT+02:00) Berlin
 Heiko	wiking: ok, here I am on an ancient machine :)
 sonne|work	and then 10am-12pm
 sonne|work	so we do it in 2 hours now?
@wiking	nono
@wiking	it's just a block of time
@wiking	and we do it
@wiking	now
@wiking	in 20 mins
 Heiko	wiking: can also do now as said, but in 20 is also fine
@wiking	but then again if everybody is here
@iglesiasg	I can start now too
@wiking	we can just start right away
@wiking	lisitsyn: ?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, hello?
@iglesiasg	wiking, the fast guy :P
@wiking	ok he is 'brb' i guess ;)
 sonne|work	ok then in 20 mins
 Heiko	ok then ill get breakfast and coffee, see you in 20 :)
@wiking	Heiko: :)
 Heiko	wiking: could you also add obtain_from_generic to the list?
@iglesiasg	and the NIPS workshop?
 Heiko	wiking: and I also have a couple of other things: modlselection and sergeys auto getter/setter
 Heiko	and NIPS
 Heiko	iglesiasg: yeah :)
@wiking	Heiko: oh yeeah nips
@wiking	Heiko: okok doing it
@lisitsyn	I am here
@lisitsyn	sorry
 Heiko	and maybe even discuss how we can get rid of old non-working code
 Heiko	wiking: see all those general things to discuss issues
 Heiko	but maybe not all, its too much :D
@wiking	ok i've updated
@wiking	but then again
@wiking	we'll start discussing
@wiking	and i'll do the notes
@wiking	and will update it after the meeting
@lisitsyn	who's on duty next time?
@wiking	lisitsyn: we'll discuss this as well during the meeting
@wiking	;P
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'm just getting a coffee
@wiking	5 mins and i'm back
@wiking	ook?
@iglesiasg	al right
@iglesiasg	all*
@wiking	ok back
@wiking	sonne|work iglesiasg lisitsyn Heiko shall we start?
@iglesiasg	yes
@lisitsyn	I am ok to start
@wiking	anyhow i wanted there's a 0. point where i'd be writing the most and then you can catch up
@wiking	so i just wanted fast review of what has happened with the last meetings points
@wiking	so doc-sprint application again went to south :( but again thanks a lot for Heiko to putting the applications together!
@wiking	cmake (we'll get back to this anyways)
@wiking	and unfortunately as until now i have no updates on the shogun fundation, but i guess sonne|work and Heiko would know about that
@wiking	and as a remaining point
@wiking	who wants to organise the next meeting?
@lisitsyn	I can
@wiking	ok it's yours then
 Heiko	ok to start
 sonne|work	wiking: any news on the video upload?
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah that's still 0.
@wiking	it's my bad we have these delays but i promise that the first ones are going up today
 Heiko	shogun foundation is in (slow) progress
 Heiko	sonne|work: see my email to you the other day
@wiking	had to put together a python script because my internet here at my place now is really shit
 Heiko	wiking: good idea to review the old meeting points
@wiking	ok then
@wiking	everybody is here so let's kick it off
 Heiko	wiking: about the appllocation to docsprint, we will meet the people at gsoc summit and ask them what we need to do to get in :)
@wiking	ehehh cool!
@lisitsyn	yeah directly ask carol hah
 sonne|work	Heiko I mean all we need is the updated letter right? Signatures is nothing you have to take care of
 Heiko	sonne|work: I need the names
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I did last year - not so easy...
 Heiko	you are right, not the signatures, so if you could send me the list with the names (for voting, satzungsupdate etc)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I see
 sonne|work	Heiko ahh ok. Let me add it to my todo
 Heiko	cool
@wiking	ah and one more thing about 0.: we are getting a new buildbot server for shogun
 Heiko	cool, what exactly?
 Heiko	just heard its 35 euros a month
@wiking	sonne|work: ordered a 36euros/month server
@iglesiasg	yep, which one is at the end?
@wiking	the cheaper option
@iglesiasg	aah the one of the page in German IIRC
 sonne|work	24G core i7
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	ok so first point in the agenda
@wiking	next release
 sonne|work	I guess we will have it next week
@wiking	when do we want to have it
@wiking	as just a vague deadline
 Heiko	I vote for 1-2 weeks after gsoc
 sonne|work	but it is not 'just' a buildbot but a machine we all will have logins to
 sonne|work	Heiko when is end of gsoc?
 sonne|work	1 month still?
@wiking	Heiko: so which week?: )
@iglesiasg	yes, I think the end of September is the right reference date
@wiking	okey so let's put it around 30th of sept ;)
 Heiko	eval deadline
@iglesiasg	let me check a second
@wiking	so basically there's a lot of things to do before we can actually release
 Heiko	Should we maybe start having lists of things that need to be done before release?
@wiking	yes
@iglesiasg	so September 23rd is the last day
@wiking	i've tried to put together in the agenda
 Heiko	wiking: cool, where to put it? wiki?
@iglesiasg	maybe we should push it a little bit
@wiking	so that's a reference point
@wiking	but let's discuss now what is needed in more detail
 Heiko	what about having a seperate wiki page where we collect things needed for next release
@iglesiasg	a vague deadline about say, no sooner than 30th and no later than 15th Oct
@wiking	Heiko: i'm ok with that
@lisitsyn	I think we should just use milestone
@iglesiasg	that sounds good
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes
 Heiko	yeah milestone is good then we also have connected issues
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: agreed
 sonne|work	milestone & issues
@wiking	ok so instead of wiki just add issues and add it to the milestone
 Heiko	so all the gsoc projects need to be working
@wiking	i'll do this
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess it is clear that we need the buildbots to finally work
@wiking	i mean adding the milestone + issues
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah
@wiking	so who wants to join the mess of buildbot fixing with me?
 sonne|work	we still have failing tests / issues on cyg/bsd/static interfaces not tested
 Heiko	We can push the mentors and students on the GSoC meeting fridays that things are really ready by then, including all the little bits and pieces
 sonne|work	wiking: well I am doing all my spare time
 Heiko	wiking: whats wrong with the buildbots currently?
@wiking	Heiko: we need to fix this
 sonne|work	Heiko look at http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@wiking	static interfaces, cygwin
@wiking	static interfaces are not yet tested
@wiking	cmake scripts are needed for that
 Heiko	I see
@wiking	but it's more like a copy paste job
@wiking	with minimal understanding
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah that is for you
 Heiko	that sounds like you are the best man for that :D
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	fuck you all
@wiking	:D
 sonne|work	wiking: we love you too
@wiking	ok i've put myself there
 Heiko	I can help though, would like the understand that stuff better anyway
@wiking	and if anybody has the need to help just join me
 sonne|work	wiking: I tried to fix the cyg one but when running the examples locally on the cyg bot they just worked!
 Heiko	you have to show me how to do things probably thouggh
@wiking	sonne|work: fuck :(
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i've read that the other day
@wiking	that's totally weird
@wiking	but i'll try to set an env variable or something
@wiking	maybe that'll help
 sonne|work	the bsd1 fails one test for no reason
@wiking	sonne|work: i know why
 sonne|work	the osx1 - I am on it is easy
@wiking	sonne|work: some weird fbsd+gcc+gmock combination bug
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah how about that with gsomix?
@wiking	afaik it's his unit tests that are failing
@wiking	who's gonna take care of that
 sonne|work	wiking: he is busy with his non-gsoc live/job :/
 sonne|work	wiking: fix is easy - just the usual c locale issue
@wiking	sonne|work: ok you take it
@wiking	?
 sonne|work	and we have a macro for that since we needed that for other ascii files
 sonne|work	yes
@wiking	ok i've put you up for that
 sonne|work	then we have tons of warnings like http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1622/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%2887%29
@wiking	hehehe
 Heiko	argh
 sonne|work	we need to get warnings down to 0 for the release again
 Heiko	I hate these warning runs
 Heiko	why should prevent collecting them in the first place
@wiking	Heiko: we'll push the students
 Heiko	wiking: you know how we usually "fix" them?
@wiking	hehehe
 Heiko	" / ** TODO */
@wiking	well yeah
@wiking	ok next bigger step
 sonne|work	Heiko I don't know about you but I fix them properly when I do that
@wiking	who's doing the merge
@wiking	of the git flow branches
 sonne|work	of?
 Heiko	I am still for making errors out of them, then people directly document and do not push half documented code ;)
@wiking	for the release
 sonne|work	Heiko not possible - some cannot be fixed
@wiking	sonne|work: will u do the release this time again?
 sonne|work	alright what else do we need for the release
 sonne|work	wiking: you should do it
@wiking	i.e. merging the branch
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	i'll do the next release
 Heiko	sonne|work: the problem is that people (including) me dont even realise these warnings are there, maybe just a message or so would do it
 sonne|work	well look at the buildbot
@wiking	okey so next step before release
@wiking	create a page on our site where we will upload the nightly built packages
 sonne|work	I do this daily and try to fix the issues...
@wiking	who's taking this ?
 Heiko	I have another suggestion for the release
 sonne|work	wiking: copying is not the isse but the page is
@wiking	sonne|work: indeed
 Heiko	last time the NEWS file was a bit chaotic, I would like to write a proper version of it, cleaned up and structured
 sonne|work	we would need sth similar to what we already have
@wiking	so who wants to do some webpage work?
 sonne|work	ok so Heiko writes NEWS
@wiking	down with it
@iglesiasg	wiking, I am not sure what it really consists of but I guess I can do it after GSoC
 sonne|work	then we also need the python notebooks
 sonne|work	I mean a page for them
@wiking	iglesiasg: just create some page somewhere on the website where we can put the nightly packages
 sonne|work	we have them autogenerated already
@iglesiasg	wiking, we are talking about some code so the nightly build is packaged and uploaded to website?
@wiking	iglesiasg: sonne|work will do that
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: no not the upload but the list the stuff on the website
@iglesiasg	aaaah ok, that sounds easy
 Heiko	we will just have 5 notebooks after gsoc
@wiking	sonne|work: i've put you for script writing
@iglesiasg	Heiko, just 5?
@wiking	ok so ipython notebooks
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well it needs to be some dynamic script going through some dir listing releases etc
@wiking	Heiko: doesn't matter how much
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah one liner
 Heiko	later we can aim for something like http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
@wiking	we need to discuss where are the ipython notebooks are going to reside
 Heiko	iglesiasg: ah sorry 8
 sonne|work	well I would do it the same way we do docs now
 sonne|work	we have one doc per stable release
@wiking	sonne|work: you have the ipythons autogened nightly?
 sonne|work	so 2.1.0  etc
 sonne|work	and two symlinks
 sonne|work	one pointing to the current release
-!- Heiko [5accf27c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.90.204.242.124] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 sonne|work	and one to the latest (nightly)
@wiking	ah about the ipython notebooks one more thing
@wiking	nightlies should be diffed
-!- Heiko_reload [5accf27c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.90.204.242.124] has joined #shogun
@wiking	i've seen a script like this
 sonne|work	wiking: why diff?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, that makes sense, doing it as the docs
 Heiko_reload	...
@wiking	where the notebook is diffed to a 'stable' version
@wiking	'diff'
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean if we change a script it is on purpose no?
@wiking	yes but in case of nightlies
@wiking	it can been that something got broken
@wiking	in libshogun
@iglesiasg	wiking, anyway, write me to do that and we will work out the details in another moment. I am in for it *after* GSoC, so in a month
 sonne|work	I mean we don't want tests for notebooks like we have for examples or do we?
@wiking	iglesiasg: ok! :)
 sonne|work	wiking: well unit & integration tests should detect that
@wiking	sonne|work: but what if ;)
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: its possible but not really needed
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then it's off the list
@wiking	:)
@wiking	easy peasy
@wiking	so who's doing the webpage part of this?
 Heiko_reload	just test them for API consistency
@wiking	iglesiasg: you again? :)
 Heiko_reload	and people can put asserts into them
@iglesiasg	wiking, I got lost what is the second thing :D
@wiking	as we need to put it somewhere on our webpage...i.e. integrate it nicely etc
 sonne|work	no asserts in notebooks please
@iglesiasg	aaah notebook
@wiking	iglesiasg: well notebooks are generated :)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: webpage is missing
@wiking	iglesiasg: they need to be integrated somehow into our webpage
@wiking	iglesiasg: i can help out
@iglesiasg	wiking, all right, sure
@wiking	iglesiasg: so i'll put both of us
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ like this, and one notebook per entry :)
@wiking	ok?
 sonne|work	for the release I would also like to have our live demos integrated in the webpage
@wiking	okok we are over this
@wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	Heiko_reload, yeah that was my idea :) check how they were doing it
 sonne|work	wiking: live demos for the release
@wiking	sonne|work: ok who wants to do that? :)
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: man if we had this, all features of shogun with a notebook, how cool would that be ? :)
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: what is the state of the live demos?
@iglesiasg	too cool for school lol
@wiking	sonne|work: can we use the gsoc student? :D
 Heiko_reload	btw do we plan that every student does a live demo?
@wiking	Heiko_reload: did u have it scheduled?
@wiking	i mean in the initial gsoc plan of each student?
 Heiko_reload	wiking: not yet, but we can do this
 sonne|work	wiking: no this is sth we have to do
@wiking	sonne|work: okey
 Heiko_reload	no the notebook came in afterwards
 sonne|work	wiking: he did the demos we have to figure out how we want things
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	so live demos integration into the webpage
@wiking	right
@wiking	?
 Heiko_reload	how much work is it to create a demo for the project?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: which project?
@wiking	so who wants to join me for that?
 Heiko_reload	gsoc project
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: which gsoc project?
 Heiko_reload	how mnuch work to create a new demo?
@wiking	Heiko_reload: as much as a notebook imo
@wiking	you need some nice data etc
 Heiko_reload	like say we ask gsoc students to create a demo for their project , how much work would that be?
 sonne|work	well only certain things are supported
 sonne|work	like loading data from some file / display a curve / heatmap
 Heiko_reload	do you guys think we should do a demo for every student?
 sonne|work	but if you follow this then it is like notebook so rather easy
 Heiko_reload	ok,
 Heiko_reload	mandatory or not?
@iglesiasg	Heiko_reload,  I think it should be doable
@wiking	if it's doable
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: well we need more - we want it for all algorithms in shogun
@wiking	i mean we cannot ask something that wasn't in the plan really :P
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: but yes for gsoc presentation it would be very nice so yes
 Heiko_reload	does it even make sense for all projects?
@wiking	Heiko_reload: well yes it does :)
@wiking	it makes sense for anything
@wiking	it's rather just a showoff
@lisitsyn	not for all I guess
@wiking	how you can do shitz :)
 sonne|work	yeah
@lisitsyn	what would you show in IO (gsomix) project :)
 sonne|work	show off is important
@wiking	lisitsyn: loading data from web? :)
 Heiko_reload	lamday is also hard to show in a demo
 Heiko_reload	since its just an estimator :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: load a feature matrix via json :P
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: not a live demo sure
 Heiko_reload	maybe plot convergence :D
 Heiko_reload	how many demos do we have currently?
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: http://nn.7nn.de:8000/
@wiking	404 :)
@iglesiasg	404 here too hehe
 sonne|work	well you have to choose one of the urls
@iglesiasg	but the list is there
@wiking	yeah i've got it :)
 sonne|work	http://nn.7nn.de:8000/ocr/entrance
 sonne|work	etc
@wiking	http://nn.7nn.de:8000/classification/multiclass
@wiking	noworkie for me
@wiking	:(
 sonne|work	ohh that is missing
 sonne|work	multiclass is left over stuff
@wiking	but yeah the page looks awesome ;)
 Heiko_reload	gp also doesnt work
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	it did last time I checked
 sonne|work	works here...
@wiking	okey
 Heiko_reload	ah entrance
@wiking	do we hve some kind of an automated test to check
 Heiko_reload	we have to have them on the website for release, just too nice
@wiking	whether it's broken or not?
 sonne|work	wiking: no
 sonne|work	no idea how to do that
@wiking	can we have one?: )
@wiking	okey
@wiking	i'll look into it
@iglesiasg	the demos are pretty awesome
@wiking	okeeey
@iglesiasg	these guys visible somewhere in the webpage would be a killer feature IMHO
 sonne|work	My dream would be that we had these demos when you click on the images at the bottom
@wiking	so i've put down some stuff fo rthe demos
 sonne|work	so on our current shogun-toolbox.org page
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	I like very much that idea
 sonne|work	the screenshots at the bottom
@iglesiasg	yes yes
 sonne|work	when you click on this some overlay opens
 sonne|work	and you see the demo
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: how much work is it to tune the demos, for example for GP, some parameters are missing etc, is it easy to change that?
 sonne|work	maybe with a little code snippet showing the real code or the link to a python notebook or so for further information
@iglesiasg	the overlay could be like lisitsyn did in tapkee
@iglesiasg	http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me/
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: yes parameters are a dictionary
@iglesiasg	oepn any of the graphical examples of usage examples
@lisitsyn	what overlay?
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: cool!
 sonne|work	yeah like this
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	that's easy with bootstrap
@wiking	okey
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: could you tell foulwall to do a heatmap for GP regression? like the one in the notebook I did for the workshop?
@wiking	so we need a complete redesign of the webpage i see that :D
 Heiko_reload	haha :D
@wiking	but yeah anyhow
 Heiko_reload	poor iglesiasg
@wiking	we'll need to do an integration of demos
@wiking	along with nightly packages and ipythons
 sonne|work	no it is not a complete redesign
@wiking	so it's quite some work on the webpage part
@wiking	;)
 sonne|work	shouldn't be too hard
@wiking	yeah but working time
@wiking	i've put down iglesiasg and myself for that
 sonne|work	yes
@iglesiasg	Heiko_reload, well I have here with me until November the guy who did the webpage. He should be able to back me up if I ask him :)
@wiking	but i'll do issues for all these
@wiking	and then anybody can join as well
 sonne|work	wiking: ok so I guess the release plan is clear?
@wiking	not yet
@wiking	fix CPACK scripts for creating tar.gz and .deb, .rpm and .mpkg packages
@wiking	i know i know
@wiking	i have to do it
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
 sonne|work	so clear :P
@wiking	but i need access to redhat/fedora machine
@wiking	i dont have that
@wiking	maybe we the new machine?
 sonne|work	wiking: well install one on the new machine in a chroot
@wiking	sonne|work: ok then i'll w8 for that one
@wiking	i guess we have plently of stuff to do till the next release :)
@wiking	so afaik we can get to the point in the agenda
 sonne|work	yeah I guess it is 1-2months work...
@wiking	i would go directly to
@wiking	Application to NIPS workshop
@wiking	as it has a priority
@wiking	ok
@wiking	?
 sonne|work	Who wants to go to NIPS?
@wiking	as most of the things we discussed for the release
@wiking	like demo + ipython notebooks
@wiking	would be required for the NIPS workshop presentation
@iglesiasg	before going we should prepare something and get it accepted, right?
@wiking	2 things
@wiking	1) when is the deadline in the application
@wiking	2) when is nips :)
@iglesiasg	like a paper I guess
@lisitsyn	wiking: 9 oct iirc
 sonne|work	well if   no one wants to go we don't have to right?
 Heiko_reload	so application deadline is early oct
@lisitsyn	wiking: nips is early december
@wiking	Heiko_reload: good
@lisitsyn	10-12 or so
 Heiko_reload	call for bla is not out yet
@wiking	then we should have already the next release
 Heiko_reload	I will be there very likely anyway
@wiking	or at least  the demos fixed up wiht the notebooks
 Heiko_reload	cheng said we should submit something
@wiking	so
 Heiko_reload	so since the workshop focus is on integrated software
@wiking	then we can use all that material
@wiking	in the application
@wiking	right?
 Heiko_reload	we can focus on ipython, demos, file formats
@wiking	well
 Heiko_reload	and then connect them with backends: libsvm for example
@wiking	i would go with shogun itself
 Heiko_reload	yes true
@wiking	ipython+demos are just a great way
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: so you will go?
@wiking	to show off
 sonne|work	and give the talk?
 Heiko_reload	But focus on shogun connects many existing open-source software tools
@wiking	Heiko_reload: will you take care of the application. organizing etc?
 Heiko_reload	sure I can do that :)
 Heiko_reload	wiking: I will write a draft
@wiking	Heiko_reload: great
 Heiko_reload	we have to have the release before that so that I can rely on things :)
@wiking	ok so who wants to go
@wiking	?
 Heiko_reload	as said, I will be around anyway
@lisitsyn	I am off
@wiking	i dont have any more funds
@wiking	Heiko_reload: good
 sonne|work	ok so heiko goes does the work and gives the talk
 sonne|work	excellent!
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: are you going to nips?
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: your paper got accepted?
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: no
 Heiko_reload	Ill do a draft, you gotta help me with that!
@iglesiasg	I don't think I can get funding as a master's student to get there :S
@iglesiasg	but I would love going
 Heiko_reload	never presented software to conferences
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: you can apply
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: they do give funds to students
@wiking	lisitsyn: dontgo :(
@lisitsyn	Heiko_reload: I will run a daemon in my mind to think what should we present
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: well it is just show off time
@lisitsyn	wiking: what?
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: haha :)
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: ok
@wiking	11:08 <@lisitsyn> I am off
 sonne|work	we should next year have someone go to scipy or so
@lisitsyn	wiking: ahh no I mean
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: btw the ipython guy will be there, fernando perez or so
@lisitsyn	wiking: I won't be able to go
 sonne|work	or europython
-!- lambday [67157e4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.76] has joined #shogun
@wiking	lisitsyn: ah ok
-!- naywhayare [~ryan@spoon.lugatgt.org] has quit [Read error: Operation timed out]
 Heiko_reload	he will like how we (ab)use his notebooks :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: otherwise get fired  :D
@wiking	Heiko_reload: nips gives out funding for travel?
 Heiko_reload	wiking: yes
 sonne|work	no
@lisitsyn	hahah
@wiking	Heiko_reload: ok i can join then if i get one :)
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: they do
@lisitsyn	controversy
@wiking	anyhow we'll see
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: well not for a workshop contribution
@wiking	Heiko_reload: you just lead this one
@wiking	ok?
 sonne|work	but yes I've received NIPs travel funding a couple of times
 Heiko_reload	sure
@wiking	sonne|work: not me :)
@lisitsyn	it is a good chance to have a 'new' shogun paper
@lisitsyn	with all the people joined recently
 Heiko_reload	like to meet the guys anyway
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: if you have a nips paper and a workshop contribution you would get it
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: no there are no proceedings
@wiking	lisitsyn: good idea ! :)
@lisitsyn	Heiko_reload: ohh bad
@lisitsyn	I though there are
@wiking	lisitsyn: webpage proceedings ;)
 Heiko_reload	not for this one, it sais on the webpage
@lisitsyn	too bad
 Heiko_reload	anyway, we will put the video up
 sonne|work	lisitsyn, Heiko_reload we should rather write a new JMLR paper about shogun then
 Heiko_reload	oh I have more thing for the release
 Heiko_reload	the README
 Heiko_reload	is ooooold
@wiking	Heiko_reload: who's doing that? :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: reviewers wouldn't like it
 sonne|work	and the INSTALL files
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: they would
 Heiko_reload	but README is first impression
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: why? we haven't changed much
 Heiko_reload	talks about svms mainly
 Heiko_reload	but we can do so much more by now
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: just everything
 Heiko_reload	also on the webpage there is an old text
 Heiko_reload	should be updated before release
@wiking	ok
@iglesiasg	Heiko_reload, which one? URL?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: no we are still interfaces + SVM + one-core computing
@lisitsyn	nothing great
@wiking	lisitsyn: GP?
 sonne|work	it is the usual lisitsyn whine
-!- naywhayare [~ryan@spoon.lugatgt.org] has joined #shogun
@wiking	i mean there's really some more shitz in shogun now then just simple svms
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/information/
@lisitsyn	wiking: doesn't sound like something great ;)
@lisitsyn	more shit is not the other shit
@lisitsyn	if we went distributed or GPU or whatever
@wiking	lisitsyn: as well as fancy structural learning etc
 Heiko_reload	iglesiasg: this text is not really a good overview anymore
@lisitsyn	it would be a change
 Heiko_reload	would prefer some less technical overview and then a detailed features page with references etc
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i would suggest that i put up issues for that
@lisitsyn	I have some idea for workshop Heiko_reload
@wiking	and put it into the milestone
@wiking	and whoever grabs it
@wiking	does it
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: lets talk later
 Heiko_reload	lets press on with the meeting, I gotta go soon
@lisitsyn	ok
@wiking	lisitsyn: i would start a wiki or issue for that
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: Ill be back this afternoon
@wiking	and let's discuss it there or?
@lisitsyn	yes
@wiking	ok
@wiking	next poing
@lisitsyn	please add issue
@wiking	point
@wiking	Serialisation framework
@wiking	so we have this nice new feature branch
@lisitsyn	oh really
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	SerialUTests
 Heiko_reload	sonne|work: why did you close the issue on json?
 sonne|work	we are talking shogun 0.10.0 vs shogun 3.0 you know that right?
 Heiko_reload	json breaks when there is inf
 Heiko_reload	which is a bug
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: there is no bug
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: in json you cannot store inf / nan
 Heiko_reload	yes there is, shogun crashes on save and then load
 Heiko_reload	well its written to the file by shogun
 Heiko_reload	we cannot write it and then say on loading "its not supported"
 sonne|work	true then we should just fail writing
@wiking	Heiko_reload: so i would just change the save part
 Heiko_reload	yeah thats fine, thats why I created the issue
@wiking	reopen it!
@wiking	:)
 Heiko_reload	its the last error before the automated serialization tests work
@wiking	and do the fixing there :)))
 Heiko_reload	all other things work
@wiking	Heiko_reload: what was the name of the issue?
@wiking	i mean number
 Heiko_reload	what about this idea of dropping json?
 Heiko_reload	forgot, ill check
@wiking	so yeah once we've got the travis going 100% of the SerialUTests branch we'll merge it
@wiking	and according to Heiko_reload it's really only that one issue with json
 Heiko_reload	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1467
 Heiko_reload	wiking: ah and we have to update 10 integration tests or so
@wiking	no i think it's not this one
@wiking	:)
 Heiko_reload	since I had to remove spaces from parameter names
 Heiko_reload	we now allow "_", "." and alnum
@wiking	Heiko_reload: ah no worries
@wiking	Heiko_reload: that'll be done by sonne|work  ;)
 Heiko_reload	hehe
@wiking	okey
 Heiko_reload	oh and the only reliable serialization is hdf5
@wiking	Heiko_reload: as soon as we get travis running we are good
@wiking	to merge...
@wiking	right?
-!- van51 [~van51@ppp-94-66-85-49.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
 Heiko_reload	all others only work up to 1e-6 or 1e-8
@wiking	yeah that was expected
 Heiko_reload	yes
@wiking	ok so we've talked with sonne|work
@wiking	and we'll keep json
@wiking	just add new one
 Heiko_reload	ok then
@wiking	like msgpack
 Heiko_reload	what do we do about inf
 Heiko_reload	?
 Heiko_reload	since some classes contain it
@wiking	that's a more precise JSON like
@wiking	output
@wiking	ok it was this issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1464
@wiking	reopened it
@wiking	basically either we fail at writing
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: well fail writing
 Heiko_reload	and then?
@wiking	or just put there MAX_DOUBLE
@wiking	or something
 Heiko_reload	no serialization?
 Heiko_reload	nono
 Heiko_reload	no max double
 sonne|work	yes fail
 Heiko_reload	fail?
 Heiko_reload	ehm
@wiking	i mean it's pretty stupid to have a serialization framework
@wiking	that only works partly
@wiking	;)
@wiking	i mean not framework
@wiking	but output
@wiking	format
@wiking	in this case just lets drop json
 Heiko_reload	fine for me
@wiking	and use something that supports all the things we need
 Heiko_reload	leaks also btw
@wiking	like inf and NaN
 Heiko_reload	as some of the other writers do
@wiking	because to have now a half working serialisation writer
@wiking	it's just no use
@wiking	we open here pandora's box
 sonne|work	well people use json for serialization
 Heiko_reload	I am fine with dropping if it cannot support inf
 sonne|work	I am against dropping
@wiking	ok let's do a vote
@wiking	:)
@wiking	iglesiasg: lisitsyn
@wiking	:D
 Heiko_reload	I dont really care to be honest
 sonne|work	it is an easy way to transfer from js
 Heiko_reload	ok
 sonne|work	err to js and de-serialize
 Heiko_reload	but what about the inf then?
@lisitsyn	Heiko_reload: +
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	NO INFs
@wiking	ok so we have nocares
@wiking	:)
 sonne|work	I don't have SVMs with INFs
@wiking	but that doesn't mean that other parts of shogun doesn't have that either
@wiking	:)))
 Heiko_reload	so a users starts using json for his stuff
@wiking	i mean we just cannot go
 Heiko_reload	puts in some work
@wiking	worksforme wit this
@wiking	:)
 Heiko_reload	and then discovers that he cannot use it since there are infs
 Heiko_reload	that is annoying
@wiking	Heiko_reload: +
 sonne|work	then don't use json
 sonne|work	it is that simple
 sonne|work	if you want a non-lossy format use that one
 sonne|work	and use that by default
@wiking	ok so let's say we fix json serialization
@wiking	by not supporting NAN and INF
@wiking	and just die with it
 Heiko_reload	well ok, i still dont like that though
@wiking	and add a more mature serialization backend
@wiking	like msgpack
 Heiko_reload	wiking: can you blacklist the inf classes?
@wiking	ok?
@iglesiasg	we should just fix json standard, easy :D
 Heiko_reload	fine with me
@wiking	iglesiasg: but we cannot as json doesn't support NaN and INF
@wiking	:)
 sonne|work	I mean it is like saying python should not support json because it cannot encode inf
@wiking	so there's really no way around this
@iglesiasg	wiking, that's why, fix it so it supports it :D jk
@wiking	iglesiasg: aaah json itself
@wiking	ok i get it
@wiking	:DDD
@wiking	yeah that's a good task for another month :P
 Heiko_reload	?
 Heiko_reload	just throw an error
 Heiko_reload	on writing inf
@wiking	sonne|work: ok let's just fix then by SG_ERROR if inf/nan comes
@wiking	and that's it
 Heiko_reload	since currently it DOES write inf
 Heiko_reload	to the file
@wiking	ok cool
@wiking	we fix it by exit(1) :)
 Heiko_reload	and then blacklist the classes
 Heiko_reload	please do a proper error message :)
@wiking	Heiko_reload: blacklist? why?
 sonne|work	SG_ERROR
@iglesiasg	error message yeah
@iglesiasg	exit(1) lol
@wiking	i mean it should be just SG_ERROR and that's it
 Heiko_reload	wiking: since some classes contain inf by default
@wiking	Heiko_reload: that's ok
 Heiko_reload	no
 Heiko_reload	then we get an error in automated tests
@wiking	Heiko_reload: if JSON sees INF
@wiking	ah fuck
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	noooooo
@wiking	i dont waaaaaant
@wiking	NOOOOO
@wiking	drop this fucking json
@wiking	:D
 Heiko_reload	thats my point
 sonne|work	drop the automated tests
@wiking	sonne|work: really? :D
 Heiko_reload	having serialization that only support half of the classes is weird
 Heiko_reload	no, these tests are very helpful
 Heiko_reload	I found 100 bugs through them
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: live is weird
 Heiko_reload	I am for blacklisting
@wiking	i mean yeah
 sonne|work	someone introduced floats
@wiking	Heiko_reload: you write it
@wiking	:)
 Heiko_reload	uh
 sonne|work	some people use ascii to store floats
 Heiko_reload	or maybe dont allow inf in default initialization?
@wiking	i dont care
 sonne|work	and we still use floats
 Heiko_reload	also not good
@wiking	just fix 1464
@wiking	:D
 Heiko_reload	what about
 Heiko_reload	ignoreing the parameter :D
@wiking	hahah no fucking way
@wiking	that's not serialization
@wiking	btw
 Heiko_reload	no idea
@wiking	seriously
@iglesiasg	it would be nice if we can have a way that a problem exits with an error and it can be controlled from a test
 Heiko_reload	blacklisting seems the only way
@iglesiasg	so the test doesn't break
@wiking	what is the point of JSON serialization
@wiking	there's no way you can deserialize a class
@iglesiasg	problem -> program
@wiking	w/o shogun
@wiking	i mean lets say i deserialize an SVM
 sonne|work	next topic please
@wiking	what could i do with that in .js ?
@wiking	sonne|work: seriously
@wiking	what you do with a JSONed SVM
@wiking	w/o shougn
@wiking	*shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: run it in .js
@wiking	how?
@wiking	sonne|work: it will auto deserialize it?
@wiking	into what?
 sonne|work	with code I write?
@wiking	sonne|work: for .js ?
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	js does this for me
@wiking	i mean i dont see how u use a serialized shogun class in .sj
 sonne|work	I have the whole object already
@wiking	*js
@wiking	so you just do deserialize(JSONedSVM) in .js
 Heiko_reload	wiking: blacklisting inf classes
@wiking	and you have it there
* iglesiasg brb
@wiking	and you can run that svm ?
 Heiko_reload	its the best choice in this situation
@wiking	if that's so it's cool
 Heiko_reload	1.) throw error upon writing inf
 Heiko_reload	2.) blacklist json serialization classes
 Heiko_reload	3.) be happy again
@wiking	i mean i dont see how it's possible to run a serialized SVM w/o libshogun
 Heiko_reload	4.) continue with meeting since I have to go in a few mins :)
@wiking	but it's maybe just my lack of knowledge...
 sonne|work	yeah continue
@wiking	nono pelase
@wiking	i want to know this
@wiking	:)
 Heiko_reload	or even finish here?
 Heiko_reload	already enough, we can have anothoer meeting in a few weeks
@wiking	auto generate obtain_from_generic function for all classes
 Heiko_reload	ah yes
@wiking	i'll do this
@wiking	so the conclusion on the end
 Heiko_reload	+1 for the global functions
 Heiko_reload	and optional with ifdef
 Heiko_reload	so that we dont need jinja
@wiking	do we have a separate .h+.cpp for this right?
@wiking	and there just do the ifdef
 Heiko_reload	wiking: yes I think thats best
@wiking	ok and it'll go into shogun/base
@wiking	ok done
 Heiko_reload	the things are for modular interfaces anyway
* iglesiasg back
@wiking	okok i'll do that one
@wiking	ok next one
@wiking	Sergey's idea about auto setter/getter
@lisitsyn	ohh
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	so lisitsyn go ahead
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: told me he would write a feature branch with that :)
@lisitsyn	yeah I'd rather try
@lisitsyn	and check what happens
@wiking	okeeey
@lisitsyn	have all of you seen the issue?
@wiking	lisitsyn: vaguely
@wiking	i have no fucking clue
@wiking	:)
@wiking	what it's all about
@lisitsyn	wiking: okay so idea
@lisitsyn	is to stop writing get/set methods
@wiking	lisitsyn: + for that one (see c#) :D
@lisitsyn	I came with some solution
@lisitsyn	instead of adding getter
@lisitsyn	we add some say
 Heiko_reload	wiking: first, it would be nice to have getter/setter for all parameters since the code is cleaner
@lisitsyn	Keyword<float> my_parameter;
@lisitsyn	in sgobject we would have
 Heiko_reload	second, it would be nice if one could rely on those, for example in model-selection frameowkr
@lisitsyn	float get(Keyword<float> kw);
@lisitsyn	and the usage is
 Heiko_reload	lisitsyn: important is that users devs should be able to overload setters to add checks
@lisitsyn	obj.get(my_parameter)
@wiking	btw: Modern C++ guidelines hold that your class shouldn't have getters and setters. In fact, setters are almost completely useless, and getters have only very limited usefulness.
@wiking	If you want to change the state of a class instance, there are two ways to do this:
@lisitsyn	yes I keep that in mind
@wiking	You perform an action on it that mutates its state. You create a new instance.
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: better send a link to the issue where you explained it
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: haha yes

@lisitsyn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1265
@lisitsyn	that's the issue
@lisitsyn	wiking: yes but we should have them
@lisitsyn	(swig)
@wiking	mmm
 sonne|work	wiking: well you know ML methods have parameters one needs to specify
@wiking	yeah of course
 sonne|work	apart from that yes getters/setters should be avoided to the extend possible
@wiking	i was just copy-paste :)
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	i would say lets go with an issue + feature branch
@lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	and let's discuss experiment there
@lisitsyn	okay I have to leave in a few minutes
@wiking	ok
@lisitsyn	do we have anything else?
@wiking	last big one
@wiking	Integration tests
@wiking	this is an ongoing one
@wiking	:)))
@lisitsyn	yeah I wouldn't mind if we dropped them
 Heiko_reload	sorry I have to go now
@wiking	hehehe ok
@wiking	okey
 Heiko_reload	we have to discuss that later
@wiking	then let's say we have all discussed
 Heiko_reload	and until then, sonne|work has to fix broken tests :)
@wiking	except
@wiking	integration + migration
@wiking	but yeah
 Heiko_reload	wiking: next time
 sonne|work	Heiko_reload: well you fix the broken tests
@wiking	sonne|work: will do the broken tests
 sonne|work	I didn't break them
@wiking	sonne|work: but u can fix them :)
 Heiko_reload	i didnt break them
 Heiko_reload	i just changed parameter names
@wiking	ok so i'll write the transcript of this meeting today
 Heiko_reload	that shouldnt break anything
 sonne|work	which breaks tests
 Heiko_reload	anyway I gotta run now
 sonne|work	of course
 Heiko_reload	bye
@wiking	and start putting up issues + milestone for the next release
 sonne|work	since serialization will no longer work when you do this
@wiking	there's like fucking lot of work here to do
@wiking	for the next 1 month
@wiking	but it's going to be a good release
@wiking	if we make all of this
@wiking	thanks all to be here on such short notice
@lisitsyn	alright
@wiking	the next meeting is going to be organized by lisitsyn
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	I'll set up a doodle
@lisitsyn	I guess middle of sept?
@wiking	i think we should schedule it somewhere mid sept?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	same idea i head
@wiking	cool
@wiking	ok i'm off to get my coffee
@wiking	again
@wiking	and then i'll start writing issues :))0
@wiking	ok
@wiking	one more thing
@wiking	when are we bumping new major version
@wiking	like when we have d-pointers? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: for the next release already
 sonne|work	too many changes
 sonne|work	build system completely new
@wiking	sonne|work: so we go 3.0  now?
 sonne|work	yeah
@wiking	ah so NEWS is at the moment misleading
@wiking	:)
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so in september we'll have shogun 3.0
@wiking	woah
@wiking	nice one
@wiking	:))0
 sonne|work	well I didn't expect it to be that much
@wiking	for linux it took like fucking 15 years to do this

 thoralf	Hello!
 thoralf	wiking: Around?
 thoralf	wiking: I compiled on a new system and cmake did not detect that gtest is not available.
 thoralf	Took quite a long time to compile all the stuff just to see it fail with "fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory"
@wiking	thoralf: and?
@wiking	either give me a full output or debug it
 thoralf	wiking: What is the expected behaviour?
@wiking	thoralf: -DENABLE_TESTING=ON was given to the cmake?
 thoralf	wiking: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DTRACE_MEMORY_ALLOCS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$BUILDDIR/install" ..
 thoralf	No gtest/gmock in the cmake output.
@wiking	well cmake should not put anything about gtest/gmock in it's output
@wiking	once you start make
@wiking	then it should start doing shit with gmock/gtest
 thoralf	simply typed "make shogun-unit-test" in the cmake directory.  I was only surprised that it failed that late... after 10 minutes compiling other stuff.
 thoralf	wiking: Which files are expected in third_party so that cmake detects google mock automatically?
 thoralf	wiking: RTFM me if you like, but I didn't find it in the documentation. ;)
@wiking	thoralf: third_party/GoogleMock should have the svn checked out
@wiking	by cmake
 thoralf	wiking: Only after running make GoogleMock manually, but indeed, this worked fine.
@wiking	mmm interesting
@wiking	i'll try it locally

 HeikoS1	was
 HeikoS1	this morning
 HeikoS1	next one will be in a few weeks
 HeikoS1	there is also the gsoc meeting on friday where everyone might be around
 HeikoS1	thoralf: we will let you know before the next one
 HeikoS1	but careful, there always lots of things to do :D
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Thanks, please do.
 HeikoS1	thoralf: suggestions are also very welcome
 HeikoS1	like your hacking Tuesday :)
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Don't mind - working people don't scare me ;)
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: hi! Please, have a look at inheritance CGradientCriterion <- CEvaluation. If i understand right CGradientCriterion is used just for tell us about direction. So why is it inherited from CEvaluation?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: that is because the model selection framework is based on that interface
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: have a look into gradient model selection
 HeikoS1	in there, parameters are applied to the machine
 HeikoS1	and then CMachineEvaluation interface is used to evaluate these parameters
 HeikoS1	this "evaluation" happens to be the gradient in this case
 HeikoS1	its a bit abstract but a nice representation in fact
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: evaluating a machine can return some arbritary things, accuracy, ROC, or even the gradient
 HeikoS1	everything that fits into CEvaluation
 HeikoS1	ehm CEvaluationResult

 HeikoS1	wow now ccache kicks in
 HeikoS1	fast
 HeikoS1	think I will buy a new notebook with 8 cores soon thats really convienient
@sonney2k	hehe
@sonney2k	get 32 cores ;)
 HeikoS1	in a notebook? :)
@sonney2k	my phone has 8 cores :P
 HeikoS1	I remember something back from a computer science lecture that around 32 to 64 cores it start saturating too much due to shared memory
@sonney2k	HeikoS, tales of ...
 HeikoS1	well, 8 is far from that
 HeikoS1	I in fact have 2
@sonney2k	no seriously it depends on the application
 HeikoS1	with this hyperthreading so linux sees 4
 HeikoS1	yeah of course
@sonney2k	I observed this around 8-16 cores when I did the COFFIN experiments
 HeikoS1	ah interesting
@sonney2k	but it depends really
 HeikoS1	I think so
@sonney2k	if you can squeeze everything in cache
 HeikoS1	I mean its also really nice for just working
@sonney2k	no shared memory issues at all
@sonney2k	for compiling yes
 HeikoS1	since currently when I compile shogun, my computer getts so slow
@sonney2k	but otherwise hmmh
 HeikoS1	also I tend to have 20 program open
 HeikoS1	and you know I like eclipse :D
@sonney2k	heh
 HeikoS1	+20 open tabs in browser
 HeikoS1	and things start to get a bit slower
 HeikoS1	just passed the unit tests
 HeikoS1	wow they were lightning fast
 HeikoS1	oh, but I compiled without debug
@sonney2k	debug is always on IIRC
 HeikoS1	no
 HeikoS1	default is release

@sonney2k	gsomix, I hope you are OK?
@sonney2k	you seemed quite busy / distracted...
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. working, cleaning code, preparing PR. so, I finished a lot of my not-shogun works.
 gsomix	now I have a lot of `free' time.
@sonney2k	gsomix, OK sounds good!
@sonney2k	gsomix, so lets fix the bugs and then get at least protobuf stuff to work (or matlab if you prefer that)
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw it is .mat files reading and I guess the easiest is steal code from octave and python scipy for that
@sonney2k	gsomix, but first things first
@sonney2k	gsomix, did you fix the locale issue already?
@sonney2k	gsomix, you can just use the SG_SET_LOCALE_C
@sonney2k	and SG_RESET_LOCALE macros
@sonney2k	which you should use before reading/writing ascii
 gsomix	sonney2k, cool! I wanted to use setlocale.
@sonney2k	gsomix, we had that issue already w/ asciifile
@sonney2k	that is why I know it
 gsomix	sonney2k, OK, everything fine then
@sonney2k	HeikoS, what is colpack?
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, maybe you knows. can I use Eigen3 in commercial software?
@sonney2k	gsomix, sure
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: a library for computing graph colourings
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah but it is not in debian?
@sonney2k	where did you get it from?

@sonney2k	512MB is not enough
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what?
@sonney2k	ok so we have ~2TB on this machine
@sonney2k	HeikoS, what do they add d3 support for? I mean they can hardly replace matplotlib or will matplotlib get a d3 backend?
 HeikoS1	no idea, just talking about it
 HeikoS1	I think its in addition
 HeikoS1	being able to create these things in notebooks
@wiking	gimme
@sonney2k	wiking, you have!
@wiking	where? :)
@sonney2k	man machine fast
@wiking	what's the ip :)
@sonney2k	163MB/s for creating swap
@wiking	iiiip
@wiking	:D
@wiking	iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip
@wiking	:D
@sonney2k	ssh wiking@bug.7nn.de
@wiking	oh

 HeikoS1	wiking: haha :)
@wiking	cool
@sonney2k	wiking, I wish gunnar did transfer the domain name
@wiking	yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, I just installed the system
@wiking	me too
@wiking	sonney2k: cool
 HeikoS1	wiking: could you update the wiki on the meeting? would be good to keep good track of everything, with links to irc logs etc etc
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah i will
@sonney2k	wiking, all shogun deps should be installed now
@sonney2k	wiking, I also put buildslave etc on
@wiking	HeikoS1: i just still have to do some work
@wiking	sonney2k: \o/
@wiking	HeikoS1: non shogun related
@wiking	HeikoS1: but i have to eat something you know; )
 HeikoS1	wiking: what? you are actually doing something else? :D
@wiking	yeah unfortunately
@wiking	on windows man
@wiking	i'll fucking kill MSVC
@wiking	that's like the biggest crap compiler ever i've seen
@wiking	ok bbl
@wiking	i gotta finish this one
@wiking	*today*
@sonney2k	wiking, check /home/wiking/p
@sonney2k	then remove the file
@sonney2k	and yes you can just do
@sonney2k	sudo su
@wiking	sonney2k: done
@wiking	hahah hat paswd
@sonney2k	wiking, if you have time you can setup the buildslave
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm i doubt man
@wiking	i really have some shit here to do
@wiking	:(
@sonney2k	yeah I guessed so

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/wx5UeeWM
@sonney2k	wiking, so you could create chroots for fedora /  ubuntu etc under /home/fedora etc
@wiking	iglesiasg: u sure about that? :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, email please
@wiking	sonney2k: will do
@wiking	iglesiasg: i mean it's really not 100% that nobody can do prime factorization in O(n^p) ;)
@iglesiasg	wiking, mm I thought there is no problem sending the public key, that's why it is called public hehe
@sonney2k	wiking, at least he didn't send it to the mailinglist and IRC like Heiko did
@wiking	sonney2k: hahaha yeah that's another security guy ;)
@wiking	way to go HeikoS1 ;)
@iglesiasg	wiking, let's hope none can then
@wiking	iglesiasg: afaik the ppl owning that first quantum D-128 machine
@wiking	they can alreeady factor it quite nicely
@wiking	;)
@iglesiasg	not good
@wiking	see shor algo
 HeikoS1	guys i dont care about security, I got other things to do here :D
@wiking	or how it is called
 HeikoS1	also I can post my public key where I want
 HeikoS1	nothing unsecure about that
 HeikoS1	wiking: I just got the independent computation engine running on a PBS in python
 HeikoS1	and that rocks

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sorry about that
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, is it the new machine?
@sonney2k	now only sergey is missing
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes - try to compile shogun on it
@sonney2k	it is really an enjoyable experience
@sonney2k	(fast!)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, are we each keeping our own copy in our home?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes sure

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, compiling..
 arka	hi..m interested in this project for the upcoming 14 gsoc...can u deliver me ur mail id so that i can contct u soon..
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, me too
@sonney2k	with 8 cores
@iglesiasg	arka, you can find our mails in the web site
@sonney2k	I guess we can kill any machine :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am also doing make -j8 hehe
 lambday	sonney2k: yayy I am there
@sonney2k	lambday, alright then enjoy
 lambday	:D
@sonney2k	lambday, but note - no backups!
 lambday	sonney2k: awesome!
 lambday	sonney2k: alright
 lambday	:D
@iglesiasg	arka, but please consider using the mailing list, and more importantly reading the mailing list logs
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think we have slowed down the machine quite a bit
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I hope so, in the machine I normally work on these days the build would have finished by now :)
@iglesiasg	but it also has a powerful processor -- i7 2.8GHz
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well I see ~16 jobs running cc1plus and ccache etc
@sonney2k	load 14...
@sonney2k	it is time that we get 64 core machines ;)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, in any case it is awesome having access to a machine like this, so thank you sooo much for taking care of it!
@iglesiasg	it is like Christmas again :)
@iglesiasg	last week wiking made Christmas
@sonney2k	we need the buildbot running on this and our demo server
@sonney2k	so I guess the machine will always have some load
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, and what will happen with the machine currently running the buildbot?
@iglesiasg	is it time to become pensioner?
 thoralf	How many cores/threads/RAM?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well it can be our webserver
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but *only* webserver :)
@sonney2k	I think this separation makes a lot of sense
@sonney2k	thoralf, 24G core i7
@sonney2k	so 4 cores + 4 HT
@sonney2k	thoralf, I know you have much better stuff at ZIB so I am not even asking
 thoralf	Not bad.
@sonney2k	thoralf, 36 EUR/month
@sonney2k	thanks to google's gsoc money we can afford this :D
 thoralf	sonney2k: No, we usually don't work on the supercomputer. ;)
 thoralf	Since it's to much work preparing experiments for that.
 lambday	whoa!

@iglesiasg	omg valgrind is not installed!!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, liar ;)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, thanks! :)
 lambday	wiking: :(
@sonney2k	lambday, ?
 lambday	wiking: I have made a few more classes only visible if eigen3 is there...
 lambday	sonney2k: without colpack, I can't get it compiled
 thoralf	As everyone got a chrismas present now, may I ask for mine?  Could someone restart the builds for PR https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1473? ;)
 lambday	:(
@iglesiasg	wow valgrind didn't like EPInferenceMethod tests
@sonney2k	wow ccache does it in 9 secs if cache is filled
 thoralf	sonney2k: Which target?
 lambday	sonney2k: class_list.cpp seems to be trying to instantiate a class which should not be there in absence of an external library
@sonney2k	thoralf, can't you do it yourself?
 lambday	external library=colpack (for graph coloring)
@sonney2k	thoralf, anyway restart clicked
 thoralf	sonney2k: No, I can't.  I refused travis to access my profile/email-adresses/followers on github.
@sonney2k	lambday, how did you get colpack installed then?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Thanks.
@iglesiasg	hushell, hey!
@sonney2k	thoralf, why that?
@iglesiasg	hushell, did you find out if there was something wrong with the unit tests? I just run valgrind on them and they were all good mmm
 lambday	sonney2k: I installed it beforehand... in my system it works fine since it finds colpack and sets HAVE_COLPACK=1
 thoralf	sonney2k: Why should travis know my private mail addresses registered in github?
 thoralf	sonney2k: There's no need for that.
@sonney2k	thoralf, well.. I get your point
 lambday	without this, shogun should compile just fine, because the class I have used this library for, I've kept this inside a #if.....#endif block
 thoralf	sonney2k: I'm curious: Which target finished in 9 seconds?
 lambday	sonney2k: its a minor thing anyway... but should work fine
 lambday	sonney2k: I am afraid if things work fine in absence of eigen3, because there are a few classes I only made visible in presence of eigen3
 lambday	similar situation
* sonney2k just ordered a tomtom multi-sport gps watch http://sports.tomtom.com/en_us/?WT.dl=99&WT.z_ban_loc=Home&WT.z_ban_id=1&WT.z_ban=2&1.WT.ac=SportWatch-Banner
@sonney2k	thoralf, all interfaces
@sonney2k	lambday, but eigen3 is installed
 thoralf	sonney2k: Wow.
 lambday	sonney2k: yes that's why it works fine... if eigen3 is NOT installed, I think I'd get similar type of errors for few more classes as well
@sonney2k	thoralf, I would wish I had that back in the summer
@sonney2k	thoralf, in winter it is rather boring - since I use this for outdoor swimming
 lambday	really excited about the 3.0 release
 lambday	sonney2k: would it include the additions that we made in this gsoc?
@sonney2k	lambday, of course
 lambday	sonney2k: yayy :D
@sonney2k	that is why you all have to finish you projects :D
 lambday	sonney2k: hehehe :D
 lambday	sonney2k: well, regarding mine, all modules have been implemented.. :-/ I gotta add more and more tests...
 lambday	and think of optimitions
@sonney2k	no worries
