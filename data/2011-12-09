 sonne|work	Ram108: please idle in channel, blackburn will catch you hopefully this evening
 sonne|work	cu
 Ram108	hi Mr sonnenberg
 Ram108	I was wondering if it would be possible for you to give me a small task so that I could read it, implement it and help you build your toolbox
 Ram108	I am new to this field
 Ram108	and i would very much like to contribute and hand in hand learn machine learning
 Ram108	can i start with MLPs and RBFs as the site says they are not focused much on yet

 blackburn	there will be illegal rally tomorrow - if I disappear for 15 days - I probably could be arrested :D
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * re283bf5 / (src/Makefile.template src/configure):
 15SAAI18M	shogun: fix compilation for lua modular on cygwin
 15SAAI18M	shogun: remove double '/' on make install; compile and install with
 15SAAI18M	shogun: make install DESTDIR=
 15SAAI18M	shogun: when you are on cygwin to fix issue with special //name/ - http://git.io/6Z6eUg
@sonney2k	blackburn, trac had an internal server error!
@sonney2k	so I cannot get it back up
@sonney2k	great huh!
 blackburn	sonney2k: wow
 blackburn	sonney2k: well can you save database somehow?
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://shogun-toolbox.org/trac/report/3
@sonney2k	please port over as much as possible to github
@sonney2k	then we shut this #$$%Y*($% off
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok I have saved the list of tickets
@sonney2k	blackburn, can one do a roadmap on github?
 blackburn	sonney2k: milestones available
 blackburn	sonney2k: i.e. we can create milestone 1.2.0
 blackburn	and btw good feature too
 blackburn	if you are going to close some issue
 blackburn	just write closes #number
 blackburn	in the message
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * ra9ed516 / src/configure :
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Merge pull request #331 from romovpa/master
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Configure fixed to build matlab_static on Darwin, x86_64 - http://git.io/6LPOag
 blackburn	We support a number of synonyms:fixes #xxxfixed #xxxfix #xxxcloses #xxxclose #xxxclosed #xxx
 blackburn	'Implemented motherfucker machine. Closes #666'
 blackburn	nice feature
@sonney2k	hehe
@sonney2k	one could do that in trac too
@sonney2k	ok created milestone for 1..2.0
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: when do you plan to release?
@sonney2k	1.1.0 you mean?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	better before revolution here :D
@sonney2k	we should asap but I didn't manage to get everything compiled under cygwin
@sonney2k	however much more compiles/works on cygwin now
@sonney2k	but there are some strange things on cygwin, e.g. //home/ is not the same as /home/
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw we have our first buildbot from tu-berlin now!
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?? ?????? ? ???????
@sonney2k	I am just installing buildbot and friends...
@sonney2k	2 more will follow...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think we should have 1000 unit-tests for everything
 blackburn	then buildbots will really impact
 blackburn	sonney2k: then lets release on sunday or so
 blackburn	if I won't be arrested
 blackburn	:)

 puneetgoyal	Hello, I wanted to work on the project shogun...can anyone please let me know whom I should contact..
@sonney2k	blackburn, well each example is a unit test :)
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, blackburn or me
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, not sure what you are interested in
 puneetgoyal	I havent done much in machine learning, just a little bit introduction and have gone through your abstract of shogun
 puneetgoyal	I have a good knowledge of c++ with a introductory knowledge of python....I was very much interested when machine learning when I read about it
 puneetgoyal	I have even given a small contribution to a project in my college where some algos were applied to extract keyphrases from the text
 puneetgoyal	So, I just want to know if I can contribute somehow in this project, so that I could get something to learn
 puneetgoyal	I have full month free ahead of me, through which I can spend  my full time working on this project and would even like to work on it when college reopens...
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, are you interested in any particular application?
@sonney2k	I don't know like maybe detect spam or so or ?
 puneetgoyal	yeah...I wanted to work on this
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, I would like to find sth for you that you are really interested in
@sonney2k	this would be best to keep you motivated
 puneetgoyal	I even saw the pending projects where algorithms needed to be implemented of machine learning to embed with the current ones in shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, any ideas?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: not now, but I will came up with something
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, well you could either implement decision trees
@sonney2k	or you could work on some spam detector application
 puneetgoyal	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: we have to design it before
@sonney2k	or... blackburn would come up with something :)
 blackburn	I prefer design trees before it
 puneetgoyal	I would like to work on spam detector
 blackburn	sorry have to leave now
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, for that you should first read a paper about text classifcation
@sonney2k	e.g. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=text%20document%20classification%20joachims&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joachims.org%2Fpublications%2Fjoachims_98a.pdf&ei=T3jiTsmaNZHAtAaHt8CDBA&usg=AFQjCNEFIQKrwIPSHTyHyq8fkygXUmqABw
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: could you please write an e-mail to me? blackburn91@gmail.com
 puneetgoyal	yeah...that was wat exactly I needed :)
@sonney2k	then you could start to write your own simple detector in python / shogun
 puneetgoyal	ok
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: then we can stay in touch and came up with something
 blackburn	you are very welcome to implement anything you would like to do
 puneetgoyal	would it be good if i implement it in python? as in the abstract it was written that shogun was an advantage
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: shogun as core and application in python works well
@sonney2k	and then you could do the very same thing but much much faster for which you would have to implement hashing on words
 puneetgoyal	I mean swig*
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, all you need to do is write code in python or C++
@sonney2k	swig does the C++ -> python translation automatically
 puneetgoyal	ok
 puneetgoyal	oh, ok
