@thoralf	Hey.
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@host116-219-dynamic.27-79-r.retail.telecomitalia.it] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hey
@thoralf	Hey Sergey
 lisitsyn	wanted to share this thing
 lisitsyn	https://gist.github.com/lisitsyn/80e6370e751fbc5bcd90
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I have more or less working prototype of this thing :D
@thoralf	You're writing your own bindings from c++ to python? ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: well writing bindings are not the task
 lisitsyn	thoralf: 1) it should load things dynamically 2) it should provide an alternative to get_X/set_X
 lisitsyn	this is for pluginized shogun
 lisitsyn	thoralf: this 'tag' thing is helpful I think
 lisitsyn	I mean we could have setInt setFloat setDouble blabla
 lisitsyn	but this is totally boring
 wiking	lisitsyn: mmm
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh you're here
 lisitsyn	wiking: your comments ;)
 wiking	i dont know anything about setter/gtters
 wiking	the plugin part could be done differnetly
 wiking	i.e. when you do from shogun.features import DenseFeatures
 wiking	that could already do a call on the dylib
 lisitsyn	that's very pythonic
 lisitsyn	the main reason I didn't want to mess with that
 lisitsyn	java's import won't do that
 wiking	but that's java :)
 wiking	i mean when we do python stuff we should do python stuff
 wiking	and when we do java stuff we do java stuff
 wiking	i know that's a bit stupid but still
 lisitsyn	that's something against the shogun principle :D
 wiking	there's a good reason why scikit-learn is being used almost always
 wiking	because it's actually goes with all the python standards
 lisitsyn	wiking: well actually
 lisitsyn	I don't mind to make it specific for python
 lisitsyn	it would use the same thing anyway
 lisitsyn	wiking: in the case you didn't mean something really dynamic
 lisitsyn	did you? ;)
 wiking	noup
 wiking	and the other thing we really miss
 wiking	in case of python
 wiking	to autogen the pythondoc
 wiking	i.e. http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
 wiking	imo that could be autogenerated
 wiking	as well as for java
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah sure but I am trying to solve different thing here :D
 wiking	dunno about the api documentation format for R, ruby and the others
 wiking	lisitsyn: no i get it
 wiking	lisitsyn: but for example your setter getter things
 lisitsyn	I mean if we go with plugins we don't have specific methods
 wiking	will be again pain
 wiking	if u dont have it documented
 wiking	have u tried to do scikit-learn in ipython
 lisitsyn	no not really
 wiking	marvolous... it even autocomplete the api's function arguments
 wiking	and if your editor is set right
 wiking	it'll even show you snippets from the python docstrings
 wiking	for the given parameter
 lisitsyn	well that's the tradeoff I guess
 lisitsyn	they don't have to care about anything non-python :D
 wiking	yeah but we could care
 wiking	:)
 wiking	btw even if we go plugin based
 wiking	brb
 wiking	emergency codefix
 lisitsyn	hah alright
 lisitsyn	I'll continue meanwhile :D
 lisitsyn	in the end when it is ready I'll just ask all of you for some opinion
 lisitsyn	if we go with that - would be cool :D
 lisitsyn	otherwise that looks like a good library
@thoralf	lisitsyn: I see so much construction sites in SHOGUN.
@thoralf	You want your own now? ;)
