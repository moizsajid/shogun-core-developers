@wiking	sonney2k: lisitsyn: have u seen yesterday the conversation with naywhayare
@wiking	about their benchmarking system?
 lisitsyn	wiking: no let me read logs
@wiking	lisitsyn: kk
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh it is pretty big ;)
 lisitsyn	tl;dr :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: jk, what is the important point here?
@wiking	lisitsyn: basically that they've developed some sort benchmarking system
@wiking	and i've suggested that they should just put that into a github repo
@wiking	so that we can start hacking it as well
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah that's opensource :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: we should definitely share libcovertree
@wiking	yeah sure but now with that svn repo
 lisitsyn	which does not exist yet
@wiking	it's not so easy to hack...
 lisitsyn	but jl is a kung fu guy of unsupported code
@wiking	i mean contribute
@wiking	jl?
 lisitsyn	yeah github is much better in any sense
@wiking	libcovertree ?
 lisitsyn	wiking: :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: sorry that's another point
 lisitsyn	wiking: so I meant
 lisitsyn	john langford and his covertree
 lisitsyn	which naywhayare hates a bit
 lisitsyn	and actually I tried THRICE to patch it
@wiking	http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah
 lisitsyn	wiking: we have his code in our repo as well
@wiking	where?
 lisitsyn	but naywhayare claims it is buggy
 lisitsyn	wiking: some shogun/lib/ I guess
@wiking	src/shogun/lib/tapkee/neighbors/covertree.hpp
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah that too
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	ah somewhere else as well? :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/JLCoverTree.h
 lisitsyn	and this one
@wiking	ah src/shogun/lib/JLCoverTree.h
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	why twice? :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: they are a bit different somehow
@wiking	kk
 lisitsyn	but that's to be solved as well
@wiking	well ok that's another story
 lisitsyn	wiking: what I meant is
 lisitsyn	we both need fast covertree
 lisitsyn	I mean shogun and mlpack
 lisitsyn	so I'd push push push some shared thing
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	sounds reasonable
 lisitsyn	it would be stupid to have two implementations of covertrees
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	well u know
@wiking	there's like millions of reimplementations :)
@wiking	in shogun ::PP
 lisitsyn	yeah but no good covertree

 votjakovr	HeikoS1: hi! i'm glad to see you :) how is it going with kernel->clone() issue?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: hi! good to see you too
 HeikoS1	ah yeah, I will do that soonish
 HeikoS1	currently some other things are very pressing regarding next gsoc
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: how is it going for you=?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: thanks for you patch btw!
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: good work as usual, ... speaking of how are the string examples going? did you find any time for thoise?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: Oh, yeah :) Btw I'm trying to use GPs with preprocessed features and find a bug in parameters hashing framework
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: ah bugs bugs ;)
 HeikoS1	cool, preprcessed features would be nice
 HeikoS1	I am currently working on categorical data
 HeikoS1	with diffusion kernels
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: and btw also using lots of your GPC code for the experiments, it works really nicely
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: cool, but i'd like to speed up them
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: that would be very helpful indeed
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: did you think about this shallow copying of the kernel?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: nope, i'm waiting when you'll try to fix kernel->clone() issue :)
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: I see
 HeikoS1	so I will do that next
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: thanks :)
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: btw what are your plans for the summer?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: i still don't have plans
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: are you interested in doing another gsoc?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: i'm not a student unfortunately
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: ah too bad
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: do you want to stay in university or more into proper business world?
 HeikoS1	do you even want to stay in Russia?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: sorry, questions over questions!
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: in any case, you should stay involved in shogun! :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: i'm pretty flexible to change my location, but now i'm in Russia
 HeikoS1	ever thought about doing msc or phd in machine learning?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: actually nope :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: but it would be cool, i think
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: so here in europe at least, that would be a quite good match to your skills, just to let you know
 HeikoS1	I am sure many people would appreciate that
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: Yeah. Btw I think my patch may be merged
 lisitsyn	votjakovr: still in saint p? ;)
 votjakovr	lisitsyn: yeah

 thoralf	wiking: I found a case NCBM gets stuck due to numerical issues... and I discovered a few places where NaNs occur and result in non-terminating QP solver.  (e.g. in the line search)
 thoralf	Interested in this or are you already over it? ;)
@wiking	nono
@wiking	just send the issue
@wiking	and i'll give it a look
 thoralf	Cool.  On my way.
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1830
 thoralf	The numerical stuff is at least indirectly related to the problem.
 thoralf	Hot-fixing only a few of the points turns out to solve the problem at least for my example.
 thoralf	But what makes me more thoughtful is that your code creates something that cannot be solved by our QP solver.
@wiking	?
@wiking	what do u mean?
@wiking	or what exactly do u mean about 'creates something that cannot be solved by our QP solver.'?
 thoralf	The qp solver does not converge.
 thoralf	It simply got stuck (not the first time though)
@wiking	you mean ncbm gets stuck
@wiking	right?
 thoralf	Probably NaNs in the OP.
@wiking	k
@wiking	will try to check
@wiking	have a new qp solver idea
@wiking	but no time to do it :<
 thoralf	Varying parameters in the problem yields *either* to non-converging qp solver or forever iterating ncbm.
@wiking	btw is your problem concave?
@wiking	i.e. non-convex
 thoralf	It's a toy example.  Maybe.
 thoralf	Or, probably.
 thoralf	Never thought of, but good point.
@wiking	since ncbm should be used mostly for non-convex problems
@wiking	i mean that's what it's for actually
@wiking	although that shouldn't mean that it cannot solve a standard convex problem
