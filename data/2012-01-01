 puneetgoyal	blackburn : hi
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: hi
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: I wanted to ask you one more thing....If I create a matrix with the top most words of each document...the matrix will only be having the tf-idf values right?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: yes, tf-idfs associated with these top words
 puneetgoyal	and we will only be  using those values in computing...and not the words themselves?
 blackburn	yes, for classifying we will use this representation, without words explicitly
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: but these values could be for any document...if we are not verifying them with the words
 puneetgoyal	I mean...words will tell us if the email is a spam or a ham..and not the importance of any word to the mail
 blackburn	hmm in this approach this importance matters
 blackburn	i.e. if we choosed words 'porno', 'viagra', etc
 blackburn	then with weights calculated we could determine spam or ham
 puneetgoyal	yes, we need to know that these words are there
 blackburn	well if tf-idf is not zero it is there for sure
 blackburn	we learn classifier, not doing heuristics
 puneetgoyal	what I mean is...if we are looking for a spam and has some word 'porno' with the highes tf-idf value...say 0.2   ......and we have another mail with some word 'computer' as the most important word...with same value 0.2 and we have gave them the respective labels
 blackburn	no, 'top' words are chosen dataset-wide
 puneetgoyal	ohk..so it means we will be using the same words in the test mail as well?
 blackburn	yes
 puneetgoyal	ok
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: e.g. porno, viagra, the, hello, sincerely
 blackburn	:D
 puneetgoyal	ok...got it now...thanks :)
 blackburn	but 'the' is bad word
 blackburn	it will have ~0 idf
 blackburn	cause it is common used
 puneetgoyal	yes...its one of the stop words
 blackburn	with tf-idf you would not have to choose some stop words or so
 blackburn	that's what we do in machine learning - it is better to do things automagically
 puneetgoyal	yeah...they get out automatically...with the calculation
@sonney2k	I would suggest to even just use n-grams
 blackburn	sonney2k: wow mysterious guy here!
 CIA-1	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r9ab7e21 / (9 files in 2 dirs):
 CIA-1	shogun: Merge pull request #346 from karlnapf/master
 CIA-1	shogun: load_file_parameter (+11 more commits...) - http://git.io/719kug
 blackburn	uncatchable sonney2k
@sonney2k	blackburn, just normal overload
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you had holidays?
@sonney2k	exactly - more work then no holidays :)
 blackburn	crazy
@sonney2k	seems like heiko has been doing a good amount of work :)
@sonney2k	lets hope he manages to complete things before vanishing in studies again...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have absolutely no idea what are you guys doing
@sonney2k	it is still all about this serialization business and variable name / type changes
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you have a chance to glance over my paper soon?
@sonney2k	e.g. one could have scalar parameters C1 C2 and that change to a parameter vector called C
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	and now you serialize one object that has C1 / C2 (old shogun version)
@sonney2k	and want to load it into the new one
@sonney2k	so we need a migration C1 / C2 -> C
@sonney2k	heavy stuff
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	unmanageable
@sonney2k	blackburn, as I told you I read your paper
 blackburn	yes but you wanted to make some fixes
@sonney2k	and wanted to do some fixed but didn't find the time for that :(
@sonney2k	no big things though
 blackburn	yes, exactly what I'm asking
