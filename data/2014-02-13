 pranet	It's either doing "ldconfig" OR adding the missing files to /usr/lib/ then then doing "ldconfig".   One of the two, I'm not sure.
 pranet	If it happens on another system, i'l verify which one it was

 wiking	lisitsyn: !!!!!!
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 lisitsyn	how can I help you ;)
 wiking	lisitsyn: so how would u feel if you would need to work on an xml that actually using different id-s to cross reference within an xml
 wiking	so imagine a 1 level deep xml
 lisitsyn	wiking: hmm
 wiking	so <a><b id/> <b id>....</a>
 wiking	and then
 wiking	<c> <d id=> <x bid=></d>....</c>
 wiking	no <ref:
 wiking	no nothing
 wiking	just like this
 wiking	:)))
 lisitsyn	bid is
 lisitsyn	b id
 lisitsyn	right?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	and it's like this
 lisitsyn	how does it help you
 lisitsyn	to do what?
 wiking	you have like 5 sets
 wiking	like <a> and <b>
 wiking	and then you cross reference within these sets
 wiking	by using ids
 wiking	not fucking <ref: noooo
 wiking	that' would be tooo advanced
 wiking	so and now
 lisitsyn	wiking: haha
 wiking	imagine that you need to write an xslt
 wiking	over this
 lisitsyn	yeah could be tricky
 wiking	i mean fuck i do not understand why would they use xml for this
 wiking	i mean either use self contained entities
 wiking	or if not then dont use xml
 lisitsyn	wiking: microsoft is known to use tricks :D
 wiking	jesus man
 wiking	lisitsyn: i mean i do not fucking see the point here at all
 wiking	why would anybody use xml for such a data structure
 wiking	one could argue maybe that you can reduce the redundancy in the document
 wiking	but then why would u use xml at the first place if your problem is space
 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	i think i've found out the best way to describe this
 wiking	it's like as the html would require you something like
 wiking	<images><image id=... src="..."/>....</images> <links><a href image_id="" src="..."></a></links>
 wiking	:)

 naywhayare	wiking: I added improvements to the benchmarking system to mlpack's list of GSoC ideas as a possible collaboration with shogun (because you were interested in it): http://trac.research.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas
 naywhayare	I figured maybe we could work back and forth to improve the project idea so that it benefits both of our projects well :)
