@lisitsyn	HeikoS:
@lisitsyn	hey
-!- miniyou [538ca186@gateway/web/freenode/ip.83.140.161.134] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
@lisitsyn	is this paper already fixed? I had a few notes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: nope its a draft
@HeikoS	send me an email please and tell me all the mistakes you found :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll collect them and then send
@HeikoS	thanks a lot
@HeikoS	well do a major revision soon
@HeikoS	including a renaming :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the hardest thing about this paper is to understand how can you apply it to anything
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	there is code :)
@HeikoS	but its yet hidden
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I glanced over it once and had vague understanding of what's going on
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: and then one more bus+underground trip
@lisitsyn	now I can understand a bit more
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: e.g. I miss biased estimator definition ;)
@HeikoS	list things
@HeikoS	I will put them in
@lisitsyn	yeah sure
@HeikoS	its good to get feedback
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it seems you're a too smart so paper gets a bit of elitism ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: about command line tools
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I was serious! people tend to use them
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I know
@lisitsyn	they do compose
@HeikoS	so you vote for having such for shogun?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no idea
@HeikoS	I think it would be nice
@HeikoS	thoralf also pointed this out at some point
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: but VW is used at my job like ubiquitous
@HeikoS	Thing is maintainability and I am not sure whether it sfeasible for us you know
@lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	and I am not sure whats the priority of it
@lisitsyn	me too
@HeikoS	could be a cool GSoC project in fact
@HeikoS	lets write it down
@HeikoS	if we had a framework that makes sure the buildbot checks those things, then we are fine to add them
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think with some infrastructure we can make a ton of apps a day
@lisitsyn	parsing is not duplicated
@lisitsyn	all the io
@lisitsyn	they have common serialization
@lisitsyn	so basically any app is a 100 LoC
@HeikoS	yeap
@HeikoS	I agree
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I do not know priority but it is a cool thing
@HeikoS	I agree
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: apparently it is much easier to compose tools in shell
@HeikoS	would be cool to have this for most fundamental things in Shogun
@lisitsyn	than in programming languages
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	I have no idea why
@HeikoS	well its a but out of scope for shogun, which is more about modules that one can plug together
@HeikoS	but yeah, good thing
