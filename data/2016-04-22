@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	I hope they did not send any email with an activation link or so
@HeikoS	and we just dont see it
@HeikoS	but maybe it takes some time
@HeikoS	to process for them
@wiking	i see nothing on the mailing list
@HeikoS	maybe wait a bit more and check account every now and then?
@HeikoS	you should definitely remove your card details again
@HeikoS	just to make sure :)
