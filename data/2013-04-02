@sonney2k	blackburn, I am making massive progress on oligo
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	now I have a matrix with NaNs instead of 1's
@sonney2k	:D
@sonney2k	:``-(
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	NaNs for the win
* sonney2k eats tons of chocolate for peace of mind
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw similar to SparseUtils we should probably have a LabelFactory class for the casting business
@sonney2k	create_from_*
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was thinking about one thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: why do we have labels and features (separately)?
@sonney2k	blackburn, because labels might be anything, real numbers, ints, strucutres
@sonney2k	and features might be strings, etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes but what is the reason to keep them that separate?
@sonney2k	if they were same type no need then
@sonney2k	I see so some Label entry inside Features
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I do not suggest it yet but am just trying to understand if there is a special capability
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is one CON - for unsupervised methods or dim red etc you have no labels
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes

@sonney2k	blackburn, haha it gets worse and wors
@sonney2k	e
 blackburn	sonney2k: crashed your kernel?
@sonney2k	no but parameters are all crap now
 blackburn	sonney2k: in linux mean of kernel :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, got it to work :D
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	there is some oddity when you use it from python
@sonney2k	if you do
@sonney2k	kernel = OligoStringKernel(size_cache=10, k=3, width=60)
@sonney2k	it will accept this
@sonney2k	but the parameters for k, width etc are crap
 blackburn	sonney2k: wait so we do support keywords?
@sonney2k	no but this is what n4nd0 wrote in his test script
@sonney2k	and python didn't complain
@sonney2k	it just called the default constructor (taking no args)
@sonney2k	I have no idea why how this can happen
 blackburn	sonney2k: I expect so
@sonney2k	why does it not give an error?
 blackburn	sonney2k: empty list and kwargs**
@sonney2k	blackburn, so argument list is empty but keyword args exist?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	but why does swig allow that?
 blackburn	sounds legit to me
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think kws are always allowed
 blackburn	it is just a matter if you handle them or not
@sonney2k	I mean then it should set kws properly
@sonney2k	but it doesn't
@sonney2k	anyway results look very sane to me now

@sonney2k	blackburn, OK I've thoroughly checked local alignment, oligo and locality improved kernel
@sonney2k	they are ok
@sonney2k	the simple locality improved kernel is not
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see
@sonney2k	gunnars code is pretty hard to digest
@sonney2k	problem is that the kernel sometimes gives OK results
@sonney2k	sometimes not
@sonney2k	I don't understand why
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@187.210.54.166] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	and of course valgrind is happy too...
@sonney2k	blackburn, while we are at it - we should get rid of all the bool init() functions
@sonney2k	but use void() instead
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	there are very few functions where we actually return anything
@sonney2k	we usually SG_ERROR if something goes wrong
@sonney2k	so the code looks like
@sonney2k	SG_ERROR / ASSERT
@sonney2k	and then return true;
@sonney2k	so return values are stupid

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: String kernel fixes
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - add reasonable sqrtdiag normalizer to LI kernel
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - add convenience constructor to the oligo kernel
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - add slow compute function back to oligo kernel

@sonney2k	blackburn, found it
@sonney2k	blackburn, the SLIK kernel is not thread safe
@sonney2k	so when we call get_kernel_matrix
@sonney2k	it is done w/ multiple threads
@sonney2k	-> kaboom
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, it would be actually but it contains the init code in the compute function again - wtf!?
@sonney2k	just some left over code
@sonney2k	so it will be quicker once removed and work too..
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's why we should call all the things as generic as possible
 blackburn	I mean in kernel we should only define init
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it is some left over code obviously sb. optimized the code but forgot to remove it from comput()
@sonney2k	btw oligokernel looks like it gives best results here
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you mean w/ only define init?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it should be called in CKernel

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Bugfix for SLIK kernel
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - remove left over init code in compute function of SLIK kernel
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - this init code caused an unstable pyramid array, making
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: the kernel fail when #threads > 1
@sonney2k	blackburn, in constructor you mean?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: I know it can't be virtual but we should find a way to avoid such errors
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is not possible... we dont' know the kernels' features yet and we need to construct some array based on these features (to speed up compute)
@sonney2k	this here was really just some stupid bug
@sonney2k	so let me regenerate data for these kernels to get tests to pass
 blackburn	alrigh
@sonney2k	no idea how to do that though for static hmmm
@sonney2k	hmmhh probably generate_testdata.py
@sonney2k	kaboomn
@sonney2k	this old test generator is just so obsolete...
@sonney2k	blackburn, however it is our only chance for testing what we have in static interfaces :/
 blackburn	yeah

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: suck in new integration test data
@sonney2k	blackburn, I looked at all the HMM related stuff
@sonney2k	results are really crap
@sonney2k	some inf's in there
 blackburn	sonney2k: whoops
@sonney2k	so it is only HMM_1en10_60_4_1_0_6_3_False_CUBE
