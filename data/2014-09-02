@wiking	sonney2k: mmm seems tapkee notebook just ran fine today
@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
@sonney2k	wiking, what did you do?
@wiking	sonney2k: nothing
@wiking	sonney2k: i reckon this has something to do with the unit test errors
@wiking	every now and then isomap (or other tapkee) unit tests suddenly fail
@wiking	but then for the next n runs it's ok again
@sonney2k	different buildbot?
@wiking	nah
@wiking	nothing
@wiking	everything the same
@sonney2k	nope
@wiking	fatbot is building the notebooks still
@wiking	i haven't ported that part to hedonimsbot yet
@sonney2k	still the rbms notebook fails
@wiking	yeah about that
@wiking	i have no idea
@wiking	why
@wiking	but that's not tapkee related
@wiking	khalednasr would know the best what could be going wrong there
@wiking	brb
@wiking	i'm out for lunch
@wiking	i guess you are about to go for your morning swim ;P
@wiking	bbl
@wiking	sonney2k: one more thing if u have the time fire an issue mentioning @khalednasr about the notebook failing rbms. he'll fix it very fast (usually he does it). if u dont have the time i'll fire the issue after my lunch
@wiking	out

 Pradeep_	HI, how do we get the prediction labels for mkl
 Pradeep_	I am using java_modular
 Pradeep_	@wiking : Are you there
@wiking	y
 Pradeep_	For applying LIbsvm, I am getting error for  obtain_from_generic. error: cannot find symbol
 Pradeep_	I am using java_modular,
 Pradeep_	@wiking
 Pradeep_	@wiking similarly how to get predicted labels in mkl for binary class.
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	Pradeep_: pastebin.com src would help me heaps
@wiking	just put there the relevant part of the code
 Pradeep_	@wiking : I am trying to do basic svm classification, http://pastebin.com/TExXhwBj. Java could not find to_binary()
@wiking	Pradeep_: yeah well there's no such global function called to_binary
 Pradeep_	@wiking:  How to calculated the output predictions
@wiking	i dont even know where you've found that function
 Pradeep_	its in java_modular examples: classifier_libsvm_modular.java
@wiking	apply() generally will return you a Labels class
@wiking	ah ok yeah with importing the static function of LabelsFactory
@wiking	that's interesting as LabelsFactory has a to_binary static function
 Pradeep_	@wiking : even obtain_from_generic does not work in java modular
@wiking	so i'm wondering whether or not you are using the right version of shogun
 Pradeep_	currently I am using shogun 2.1. As other version were not getting compiled.
@wiking	Pradeep_: yeah obviously then you are having trouble
@wiking	shogun 2.1 had none of those functions implemented
@wiking	what you are trying to use are function that were introduced in shogun version 3.0.0 or later
@wiking	i don't know why you cannot compile latest shogun verison
 Pradeep_	But in java modular examples , they have been used
@wiking	as they are compiling at the moment
 Pradeep_	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/2.0.1/java_modular_examples.html
@wiking	at 3-4 different machines
@wiking	i dont want to be too harsh and say that we dont support older versions than 3.0
@wiking	but really 2.1 is very very old
@wiking	please try to update it to latest version
 Pradeep_	So we have obtain_from_generic working in recent version
@wiking	recent version is 3.2.0
@wiking	and not 2.1.0
@wiking	try to update to that
@wiking	and if you are having trouble compiling it
 Pradeep_	Yes thank you, let me compile 3.2 and get to you.
@wiking	just give us the error
@lisitsyn	wiking: heya
@wiking	to see what's the problem
@wiking	lisitsyn: wazza
@lisitsyn	so the thing I wanted to ask you
@besser82	Pradeep_, which OS you are using?
@lisitsyn	you know I am now gay^W using mac
 Pradeep_	ubuntu
@wiking	lisitsyn: hahahah yeah :)
@wiking	Pradeep_: which version of ubuntu?
@lisitsyn	and I have like no such instruction things
 Pradeep_	ubuntu 12.10
@lisitsyn	with some kind of assembly
@besser82	Pradeep_, ok... no precompiled pkgs for that  :(
@lisitsyn	so I wonder whether you know this type of error and how to solve it
@lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	Pradeep_: are you like having very latest cpu inthat machine?
@wiking	lisitsyn: lol wtf?
@wiking	lisitsyn: copy-paste :)
@lisitsyn	sure
 Pradeep_	ya
@wiking	Pradeep_: an i7 or what?
@wiking	is it like i7 from yesterday? or a year old i7?
@lisitsyn	wiking: /var/folders/nn/b4rl0qh10bz638_5c0dhrwhhpncl2c/T//ccRK9Ajh.s:27:no such instruction: `vxorps %xmm0, %xmm0,%xmm0'
@lisitsyn	like that

@wiking	lisitsyn: what r u trying to compile
@lisitsyn	wiking: its bundled eigen
@lisitsyn	from hell
@wiking	Pradeep_: well that's not really a latest arch. on that 3.2.0 should compile fine
@wiking	lisitsyn: can u share codez?
@wiking	or topsecretmachine (tm)
@lisitsyn	wiking: I just run make of shogun
 Pradeep_	ok, updating the kernel can solve the prob,
@wiking	lisitsyn: mmmm
@wiking	lisitsyn: HEAD ?
@lisitsyn	it tests whether eigen is here
@lisitsyn	and dies
@lisitsyn	yes
@wiking	Pradeep_: it has nothing to do with kernel man...
@wiking	lisitsyn: aah shit i wonder why?... which version of eigen?
 Pradeep_	ok
@wiking	lisitsyn: worksforme ;)
@lisitsyn	wiking: 3.2.0 I guess
@lisitsyn	wiking: what's the compiler you use?
@wiking	although it dies of other problem
@wiking	i have viennacl installed
@wiking	and that fucks up life
@wiking	lisitsyn: clang
@wiking	the default one from apple
@wiking	Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
@wiking	Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0
@wiking	Thread model: posix
@lisitsyn	I wonder whether it is g++-4.9 (from hell)
@lisitsyn	which causes this error
@wiking	u use g++ ?
@lisitsyn	I guess it found it
@lisitsyn	lemme try
@lisitsyn	works yet
@wiking	lisitsyn: what's the eigen version u use
@wiking	?
@lisitsyn	wiking: I didn't install it
@lisitsyn	that's bundle
@lisitsyn	so whatever bundled
@wiking	bundling it
@wiking	?
@wiking	ah i see
@lisitsyn	wiking: what's the version shogun's cmake trying to download? :)
@wiking	mmm still shouldn't be a problem
@wiking	never had such error with shogun on osx
@lisitsyn	yes but gcc 4.9 could be the one
@wiking	lisitsyn: no idea
@lisitsyn	I guess I have some discrepancy
@wiking	//bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.1.4.tar.bz2
@lisitsyn	between as and may be gcc
@wiking	3.1.4
@wiking	ok
@wiking	fuck this whole fucking
@wiking	fuckshit fuck
@wiking	linalg backend
@lisitsyn	fucking fuck
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	i was the full to let this to be ever merged
@lisitsyn	see 'the fuck scene from wire'
@lisitsyn	have you seen it?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	btw this is the wtf/min count
@wiking	is around 10 per line :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh btw I watched linus thing
@wiking	or 10 wtf/second
@lisitsyn	he kinda rocks for sure
@wiking	lisitsyn: hehehe
@wiking	'i wonder how did he find mama's tits when he was an infant'
@wiking	:0
@wiking	:D
@lisitsyn	he is like a shy guy that tells you that your mom should have done some abortion
@wiking	legendary trolling

@wiking	yeah pretty much
@lisitsyn	good
@wiking	 no fucking around
@wiking	they never talk
@wiking	only when it's necessary
@wiking	but then they dont really beat around the bushes
@wiking	ok have fun with eigen
@wiking	it worksforme eigen 3.2.x
@wiking	but dont try to use viennacl
@wiking	coz it's fucking broken atm
@wiking	;)
@wiking	lalala
@lisitsyn	feeling mindfield
@lisitsyn	mine*
@wiking	yep
@wiking	it is
@wiking	linalg backend hax0rers
@lisitsyn	uhmm I've got another shitload

@lisitsyn	that's a real thing for real playa
@wiking	good i see you learn fast ;)
@wiking	oh duuude
@wiking	this is now with clang or gcc?
@lisitsyn	any playa from da hood is like using it
@lisitsyn	I think it is like clang and gcc just had sex
@wiking	yes
@wiking	and one is using libstdc++ the other is using libc++
@lisitsyn	ahh hahaha
@wiking	so this is awesome fun
@wiking	:)
@lisitsyn	I think I should make clean
@wiking	no
@wiking	you should make rm -rf build
@wiking	just to be on the safe side ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: btw u can check out the stuff that the osx bot does
@wiking	it's a simple 10.9 install
@lisitsyn	yeah at least this clang + gcc love affair should be safe

@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20modular_interfaces
@wiking	check the configure and make steps if u fancy
@wiking	c# is just broken
@wiking	i mean c# modular
@lisitsyn	hmm ok it kind of works
@wiking	but i guess it's not your aim to use on your osx :PPP
@lisitsyn	yeah I am not a pervert

@wiking	so yeah i think kevin could do the NIPS demo
@wiking	sonne|osx: only that it's using now a script that allows generating notebooks in parallel
@wiking	apart from that it's all the same
@lisitsyn	hey we should showcase our notebooks generation
@lisitsyn	we can generate them in parallel
@wiking	dunno why the website is not being able to scrap the image
@lisitsyn	and even distributed
@wiking	lisitsyn: dont be a troll :D
 sonne|osx	I think we should showcase how to tame a russian.
@wiking	too much work and no fun makes lisitsyn a troll :

@lisitsyn	impossibru
 sonne|osx	I know you have tanks but that doesn't stop us.
 sonne|osx	wiking: ok I see the html/ipynb files sitting there...
@wiking	sonne|osx: yeah we had troubles with file mode, but i've fixed that
@wiking	so i really dont know why suddenly it doesn't work now
@lisitsyn	hmm we can also commit something and show how buildbots get red
 sonne|osx	wiking: maybe an upgrade of libs underneath?

@wiking	:DDD
@lisitsyn	wiking: do you have business-regularized linear regression in your shogun?
@wiking	i'm just adding it
@lisitsyn	sas can haz it you have to live with that
@wiking	wait for it... wwaaaait for it!

@wiking	i'm just missing a meeting in Delft... :<
@lisitsyn	well it is not that far away
@lisitsyn	just walk on by
@wiking	lisitsyn: i know man i mean yesterday i was looking at this dataset and i was wondering why dont we have like a multi-variate streaming classifier
@wiking	i really need that in shogun
@lisitsyn	wiking: is it business-regularized?
 sonne|osx	wiking: indeed notebooks look different
 sonne|osx	wiking: there is " at a blank line ending the image now?!
 sonne|osx	wiking: and on the next line there is a >
 sonne|osx	meh
@wiking	sonne|osx: wtf, how come?
@lisitsyn	oh guys guys we can also predict whether commit is going to break the build
@wiking	lisitsyn: hahahahahah
@wiking	:D
@lisitsyn	being regularized it would become like a list of blacklisted contributors
@wiking	lisitsyn: it's easy
@lisitsyn	it will ban me and some other guys
@wiking	it always breaks something
@lisitsyn	haha
@wiking	sonne|osx: berlin needs to build a congress centre

@lisitsyn	if [ $author -eq wiking ]
@lisitsyn	echo It is not polite

@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	all these nerds deals
 sonne|osx	but there are certainly more
@wiking	btw i'm presenting soonish shogun @ a meetup here in sg
@lisitsyn	wiking: about buildbot?
@wiking	alhtough i hope that it'll be after the next release
 sonne|osx	wiking: in chains?
@wiking	lisitsyn: nono about config.h
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh this is a long talk
@wiking	and how important config.h generation and syntax is

@lisitsyn	wiking: there should be a notion of buildbot
@wiking	well yeah i mean we need to learn how the macros are being generated
@lisitsyn	if you get wrong config.h it can go red
@wiking	to predict the next macro name
@wiking	to be able to precache the code generation
@lisitsyn	with svm?
@wiking	so there's really a lot to cover
@lisitsyn	ehm I am sorry
@lisitsyn	there is no svm anymore
@lisitsyn	shallow neural net
