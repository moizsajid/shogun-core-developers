@sonney2k	blackburn, so then you know what to attack...
@sonney2k	but hey
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you suggest me parameters for promoter kernel?
 blackburn	"degree": 4, "shifts": 0, "kernel_cache": 500, "center_offset": 3, "center_pos": 1
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * re8bff92 / (src/shogun/base/Parallel.cpp src/shogun/base/Parallel.h): don't call library function in header file Parallel.h -> move it to .cpp - http://git.io/kRt-tQ
@sonney2k	degree 20
@sonney2k	shifts - the more the better
@sonney2k	(expensive though)
 blackburn	is 10 ok?
@sonney2k	rest I didn't use just
@sonney2k	it will work
 blackburn	chris gave me some code with some promoter kernel
 blackburn	as kpca is ready I'll try to apply it
@sonney2k	blackburn, all of CMath call library functions from the .h
@sonney2k	*sigh*
 blackburn	bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: ohhh.. I can't apply kpca to string data
 blackburn	we can't change 'domain'
 blackburn	DAMN
 blackburn	well I can but it is a little dirty trick
@sonney2k	blackburn, why not?
 blackburn	because it changes feature matrix of features
@sonney2k	you type - yeah right
 blackburn	the only way i can see is to delete given features
@sonney2k	you mean
 blackburn	and replace pointer
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	with new simplefeatures instance
@sonney2k	then better add a obtain_from_kpca function to simplefeatures
 blackburn	may be apply_to_string_features?
 blackburn	in kpca
@sonney2k	why that?
 blackburn	I don't understand what obtain_from_kpca function should do
 blackburn	I already did apply_to_distance in MDS and isomap
 blackburn	it looks convenient for me to do that
@sonney2k	blackburn, it would return transformed features based on the preprocessor and its feature object
@sonney2k	I really need to sleep now
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	me too

@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know ... seems like the spinlock one at least not
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw you did close quite some bugs without writing why?
@sonney2k	I don't know is the gsoc ideas really all done now?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well according to your words yes :D
 blackburn	well I'll reopen it if it is not done
 blackburn	GMM is done by alesis
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	structured closed by mistake
 blackburn	sonney2k: are ruby and java done?
 blackburn	cross-validation too
 blackburn	vw and online learning are done by f-x
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok
@sonney2k	java and ruby should work but we need more examples to run first to be sure
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I should wrote something..
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes write something like implemented by f-x
@sonney2k	or alesis-novik
@sonney2k	otherwise we won't know
@sonney2k	why you closed the bug
 blackburn	I'm afraid of spinlock detection still not working
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am writing it currently
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please do the change in SGObject for spinlocks?
 blackburn	some define should work
 blackburn	ifdef I mean
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	but a little bit later, I just came home from some jogging and need to take a bath :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, do we have posix thread detection?
* sonney2k can smell this from over here
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	in configure
@sonney2k	=:-)
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	line 2783
 blackburn	sonney2k: smell should be better now :D
* sonney2k cleans his nose
* sonney2k takes a deep breath
@sonney2k	yeah wonderful
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r15b3364 / src/shogun/base/Parallel.h : should be 0 instead of NULL - http://git.io/I8-zvA
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r15a636a / src/configure : add spinlock detection - http://git.io/wB1g8w
 blackburn	ah yes
 blackburn	I tried to not make mistake in init
 blackburn	but made heh
 blackburn	okay marked gsoc tasks
 serialhex	YAY i got commited!!! :P
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just noticed my headers are like MULTIDIMENSIONALSCALING_H_, but not __CMULTIDIMENSIONALSCALING_H__. does it matter?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not really
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw recall that we disabled all update issues in trac for non-authorized users because of spam? considering the latest bugreport with the user not being able to comment / answer - what do we do now?
 blackburn	well you could enable it
 blackburn	I think we will manage to delete spam if necessary
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok lets give it a try then
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok done
 blackburn	#define pthread_mutex_init(x)
 blackburn	#define pthread_mutex_destroy(x)
 blackburn	#define pthread_mutex_lock(x)
 blackburn	#define pthread_mutex_unlock(x)
 blackburn	oh
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	what are you doing?
 blackburn	not me
@sonney2k	me?
 blackburn	it is in sgobject
@sonney2k	where?
 blackburn	line 22
 blackburn	SGObject.h
 blackburn	what should we do if no pthreads there?
@sonney2k	move this logic into parallel please
 blackburn	it is not the logic, it is hack
 blackburn	for mutex things being compiled
 blackburn	if no pthreads here
 blackburn	sonney2k: so what to do if no pthreads
 blackburn	?
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r385681b / src/shogun/base/Parallel.h : Changed lock routines to pointer usage - http://git.io/5039UQ

 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r85ce83d / (2 files): LTSA and HLLE fix for pthread generic routines - http://git.io/zIQbqQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, if no pthreads things should still work
 blackburn	i've guarded it with #ifdefs
@sonney2k	so ifdef'ing stuff is best - problem in the SGBase.h case is that one has plenty of ifdefs...
 blackburn	I will introduce kernel LLE in 20-30 minute :D
@sonney2k	btw. move the library routine based calls into the .cpp
 blackburn	I became pretty active at the end of gsoc
 blackburn	hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, too bad that you werent before ;-)
 blackburn	I will move, later
@sonney2k	blackburn, move?
 blackburn	(11:56:44 PM) sonney2k: btw. move the library routine based calls into the .cpp
@sonney2k	ahh k

@sonney2k	serialhex, do you know where ruby extensions should be installed?
@sonney2k	I mean for system wide installation?
@sonney2k	some /usr/local/lib/ruby?
 serialhex	hmm... not generally no, i'll have to look, but the way i have it now is....
 serialhex	something like that, hd on
@sonney2k	k
 serialhex	/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i486-linux is where i copy the modshogun files to in order for it to work (on my debian machines)
@sonney2k	serialhex, would it work in /usr/local/* too?
 serialhex	hmm... i dunno
@sonney2k	serialhex, seems like:
@sonney2k	$ ruby -e 'puts $LOAD_PATH'
@sonney2k	/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8
@sonney2k	/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux
@sonney2k	/usr/local/lib/site_ruby
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.8
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/1.8
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux
@sonney2k	serialhex, so I will hack something up that works on make install
 serialhex	YES!  i was looking for those!
 serialhex	it wasn't working in irb for some reason... stupid thing...
@sonney2k	I am glad that my old friend google knew the answer :)
 serialhex	yes!!
 serialhex	and if you use that it should work when i use RVM or something similar for my ruby
@sonney2k	serialhex, problem is that I don't know which of the paths to use when including /linking
 serialhex	err... for peoples ruby
@sonney2k	installing even too
 serialhex	yeah, i had that problem when i was trying to get thigns to work right in 1.8/1.9 & when using anything other than debian... lemme install rvm & a few rubies on my machine & we can work on this for a bit
 serialhex	(der it's already installed as my user :P )
 serialhex	ok sonney2k, on line 686 of the configure script, the ruby *.h files should be found there
 serialhex	err, by that
 serialhex	...and the previous 'puts ...' line too
 serialhex	but for some reason it dosn't find narray when it's installed as a gem... :(
@sonney2k	puts "#{Config::expand(CONFIG['sitelibdir'])}"
@sonney2k	that would be the local install path
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@sonney2k	I don't really know how to select the right one
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about apply_to_feature_matrix -> apply_to_features?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it doesn't apply to features but only to matrix (if available)
 blackburn	threa are already two methods possible to apply to features with no feature_matrix
 blackburn	kpca and kernel lle
 blackburn	more to go
@sonney2k	serialhex, in CONFIG - can I somehow change prefix?
@sonney2k	$(prefix)
 serialhex	prefix?? which prefix???
@sonney2k	--libexecdir=$(prefix)/lib/ruby1.8
@sonney2k	is in there
 serialhex	erm... i'm not sure i fully understand
@sonney2k	serialhex, type
@sonney2k	CONFIG['libdir']
@sonney2k	there is $(exec_prefix) appearing there
 serialhex	huh, ok
@sonney2k	irb(main):010:0> CONFIG['libdir']
@sonney2k	=> "$(exec_prefix)/lib"
@sonney2k	irb(main):011:0> CONFIG['exec_prefix']
@sonney2k	=> "$(prefix)"
 serialhex	yeah i see it now
@sonney2k	so if I could change prefix the install path would be correct
 serialhex	yes, i know there is a better way to do that.. i'm looking
 serialhex	or maybe a way to do exactly that :P
@sonney2k	because I have a prefix as arg in ./configure
@sonney2k	so I would just need to modify CONFIG['prefix'] with that
@sonney2k	and then cna print the exanded path and we are good to go

@sonney2k	heiko1, so you immigrated to the netherlands?
 heiko1	hej sonney2k
 heiko1	no :)
 heiko1	just a little workshop
 heiko1	playing around with an quadcopter :)
 heiko1	10 kilometers from the frontier
@sonney2k	serialhex, any ideas?
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r0345166 / (5 files in 2 dirs): Introduced kernel LLE - http://git.io/LnQ14Q
@sonney2k	heiko1, ok so you can bike home ;-)
 serialhex	irb(main):003:0> CONFIG["prefix"]
 serialhex	=> "/usr"
@sonney2k	heiko1, so please just continue - I will then start to run the tests and hopefully conversions (give me one example please)
@sonney2k	serialhex, yeah but if I do CONFIG['prefix']='/tmp/foo'
@sonney2k	and then do puts "#{Config::expand(CONFIG['rubylibdir'])}"
@sonney2k	it still says
@sonney2k	/usr/lib/ruby/1.8
@sonney2k	even though
@sonney2k	irb(main):003:0> CONFIG['libdir']
@sonney2k	=> "$(exec_prefix)/lib"
@sonney2k	irb(main):004:0> CONFIG['exec_prefix']
@sonney2k	=> "$(prefix)"
@sonney2k	irb(main):005:0> CONFIG['prefix']
@sonney2k	=> "/usr"
 serialhex	hmm...
@sonney2k	irb(main):002:0> CONFIG['rubylibdir']
@sonney2k	=> "$(libdir)/ruby/$(ruby_version)"
 heiko1	sonney2k, yes, but i dont have a bike here :) stying here
 serialhex	ok, lemme dig deeper...
 heiko1	sonney2k, yes i am on to it :)
@sonney2k	heiko1, great
 heiko1	its a bit complicated now to write the conversion methods, but i will give you an example as soon as it works
@sonney2k	serialhex, thanks - I will have to sleep now but if you manage to modify CONFIG or so in a way that I can just puts of the expanded string - I can immediately use it for configure / make install
@sonney2k	heiko1, ok thanks
@sonney2k	I took part in some long distance swimming event today (3.5km) - so I now need some sleep :)
@sonney2k	cu all
 blackburn	good luck to you :)
 blackburn	see you
 heiko1	ok have a good rest :)
 blackburn	heiko1: hey what's up?
 heiko1	hey blackburn, chilling in the netherlands and hunting bugs, and you? :)
 blackburn	heh, chilling in russia, implementing more methods :D
 heiko1	nice :)
 serialhex	ok, np sonney2k
 heiko1	but i am a bit in a hurry here, hope i finish this soon
 heiko1	heureca, first time program runs without memory errors, just leaks now :)
 blackburn	what is it you are finishing?
 heiko1	version conversion of parameters
 blackburn	ah
 heiko1	to be able to load old serialized instances
 blackburn	I guess it is pain in ass
 heiko1	deeply
 heiko1	but: first version working
 heiko1	 :)
 heiko1	only 20 frees missing in my example
 heiko1	type conversion
 heiko1	name conversion
 heiko1	everything possible now
 heiko1	but its very technical, a bit annoying though
 heiko1	goind to bed
 heiko1	good night all
