 n4nd0	blackburn: around?
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	does this look weird to you? http://pastebin.com/832RHTKQ
 n4nd0	it segfaults
 n4nd0	I don't really understand why
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	you need to do
 n4nd0	what is it?
 blackburn	for (int32_t i=0; i<new_num_cols; i++) new (&out[i]) SGMatrix<T>();
 blackburn	before setting matrices
 n4nd0	oh
 blackburn	n4nd0: you allocate memory for matrices but reference counts are not allocated
 blackburn	and when you try to do =
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	it tries to free up matrix created before
 blackburn	having no reference count allocated at all it kabooms
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	but could the operator check if there is something allocated beforing trying to free up?
 n4nd0	the operator= I mean
 n4nd0	beforing = before ^ ....
 blackburn	I am not sure it would work anyway
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean with the new (&out[i]) SGMatrix<T>();?
 blackburn	no, some check in =
 n4nd0	what does new (&out[i]) SGMatrix<T>() exactly do anyway?
 blackburn	inplace new
 n4nd0	I don't think I get what the part (&out[i]) does
 blackburn	it is a pointer you use
 n4nd0	inplace? ok I am going to read about it :)
 blackburn	it acts just like 'new' operator but exactly to &out[i] and not to some new piece of memory
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	in normal way it allocates object somewhere and returns a pointer
 n4nd0	interesting
 blackburn	but here we control where to place a pointer
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	not pointer object I mean
 n4nd0	ok

 n4nd0	blackburn: I have read that after using an inplace constructor one shouldn't call delete to free the memory used but the destructor directly
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you recognize that?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah
 n4nd0	so no SG_UNREF
 blackburn	yeah forgot to say that
 blackburn	n4nd0: well actually we kinda emulate new[] and delete[]
 n4nd0	blackburn: delete with SG_UNREF but new?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no I mean SG_MALLOC + inplace new = new []
 blackburn	and explicitly call dtors and SG_FREE is delete []
 n4nd0	blackburn: so I could just use new[]?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah may be :D
 blackburn	new[] is not tracked unfortunately
 n4nd0	blackburn: something line new SGMatrix<T>(num_rows, num_cols)[num]
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	yeah that should work too
 n4nd0	what do you mean with that it is not tracked?
 blackburn	sg_trace_mallocs thing won't work
 n4nd0	I don't follow you
 blackburn	n4nd0: we have --enable-trace-mallocs option for configure
 blackburn	that stores all SG_MALLOCs in map
 blackburn	and if something is not freed on exit
 blackburn	it will output
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	this new SGMatrix<T>(num_rows, new_num_cols)[num_components] didn't make the trick
 n4nd0	compile error
 blackburn	bad
 blackburn	then use that trick :D
 n4nd0	which one?
 blackburn	SG_MALLOC + inplace new + explicit dtors + SG_FREE

 gsomix	n4nd0, strange
 gsomix	it's my code
 n4nd0	gsomix: aham, do you get it too locally?
 gsomix	n4nd0, "locally". what do you mean? this stuff is in swig_typemaps.i
 gsomix	n4nd0, try make clean, hm
 n4nd0	yeah I did ig
 n4nd0	I meant locally in your machine
 n4nd0	gsomix: I don't think this is happening in the buildbot since python_modular compiles
 n4nd0	my version of swig is SWIG Version 2.0.4
 n4nd0	gsomix: can that be a problem?
 gsomix	n4nd0, I use swig 2.0.4 so.
 n4nd0	mmmm
 gsomix	n4nd0, may be a problem in the order of include files. I need to check.
 n4nd0	ok

@sonney2k	blackburn, grab the latest sources from mplayer and merge the changes to detect your cpu in configure  - the stuff is not really outdated!
 gsomix	sonney2k, \(^_^)/
@sonney2k	gsomix, can you just add a try except NameError around your memoryview expression to fix the buffer proto example?

@sonney2k	gsomix, hi there
 gsomix	sonney2k, yeah, memoryview introduced only in python2.7
 gsomix	I'll fix it, one moment
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi, do you happen to know why can this be caused? http://pastebin.com/D3Wmv2LT
 n4nd0	it looks that it compiles ok in the buildbot but not in my machine

 blackburn1	(09:55:50 PM) sonney2k: blackburn, grab the latest sources from mplayer and merge the changes to detect your cpu in configure  - the stuff is not really outdated! --------- why to detect it?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: they didn't disappear ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn1, because on some archs / machines it helps to get faster code
 blackburn1	sonney2k: native goes to correct march on my machine
@sonney2k	n4nd0, are these in .gitignore perhaps?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no, otherwise they won't appear as untracked when doing git status

 n4nd0	:O
@sonney2k	n4nd0, anyways - compile and let us know if the error appears again
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it didn't remove mines under examples/undocumented/libshogun and python_modular

 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, copilation on the way right now
 blackburn1	n4nd0: could you please do ^ too?
 blackburn1	and check -march parameter
 n4nd0	blackburn1: what do you meaan with check?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: in output there will be -march=something
 n4nd0	 -march=core2 -mcx16 -msahf -mno-movbe -mno-aes -mno-pclmul -mno-popcnt
 blackburn1	aham thanks
-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am pretty sure native detects right march
 n4nd0	sonney2k: still, compilation error
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it didn't remove those files because I was not in a root directory of their path
 n4nd0	sonney2k: they were in shogun/examples/undocumented/...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I was in shogun/src
 n4nd0	now doing git clean -dfx from shogun/ removed them
 gsomix	sonney2k, fixed, I also removed ctypes from  buffer protocol code.
@sonney2k	k
 n4nd0	bah, the error is still there :(
 blackburn	does anybody here use guake?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I installed it when you told me about it, but I don't use it much to tell the truth
@sonney2k	blackburn, march=core2
 n4nd0	I am loyal to my terminator :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: wrong?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't get why it happens

@sonney2k	blackburn, no correct
 n4nd0	blackburn: nice
 n4nd0	gsomix: let's see
 blackburn	sonney2k: so currently march=native produces correct arch for you, me, gsomix and n4nd0
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure
 blackburn	I am pretty sure it would work for anything else
 blackburn	why to do that then?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not all gccs have that
 blackburn	sonney2k: well I see no reason to use <4.3 now
 blackburn	we force to use latest swig anyway
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, I'm working today on arithmetic operators stuff. it's works for all classes with buffer.
 gsomix	DenseFeatures+=<class with buffer>, I mean
 blackburn	is it possible to DenseFeatures+=SparseFeatures?
 gsomix	trying to hacks it in shogun
 gsomix	blackburn,
 gsomix	hm

 puffin444	heiko!
 blackburn	heiko!
 puffin444	I have found a very serious bug in the model selection framework
 heiko	puffin44, oh no, what is it?
 puffin444	When I register a SGVector as a parameter, it has a pointer to the underlying SGVector.vector.
 puffin444	The problem is that if the SGVector is ever manipulated (i.e. resize) or reassigned the parameter still has the pointer to the original SGVector.vector.
 heiko	thats why usually a pointer to the pointer is stored
 puffin444	So if I ever try to resize a SGVector in an object, I can never access it through the model selection framework. Even worse, I think this leads to a memory leak.
 heiko	so that if the data changes, the pointer still is good
 heiko	puffin444, Ill have a look tomorrow, no time today unfortunately. sorry
 puffin444	Ok. I will send an example of what I mean over the mailing list.
@sonney2k	gsomix, blackburn - buffer protocol is just for dense matrices. so we could in principle support it for sparse matrices too but that would mean that we have to expand to dense first...
 gsomix	as I said
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes the fix is correct
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would rather stick to what the mplayer guys do
 blackburn	sonney2k: they have outdated as well
 blackburn	no sse4 check, no i7 support
 blackburn	the latest thing they did is core2
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, where are you now?
@sonney2k	gsomix, do you want to send a missile?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I know you are a big fan of handmade and DIY but I see no actual reason to have such crappy config no one supports
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think they check for gcc version and if it is new enough fall back to march=native
@sonney2k	blackburn, so please check if it does
 gsomix	sonney2k, huh, only dumplings :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, it would totally suffice if you stay around after gsoc
@sonney2k	I am pretty happy with what you do for shogun :)
 blackburn	they have basically the same thing we do
@sonney2k	blackburn, please test run their configure
@sonney2k	I would expect it to find march=native on your cpu just fine
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah native
 gsomix	sonney2k, no problem. I'm happy too, there is ?ool team. and thanks (*^__^*)
 blackburn	gsomix: you must be happy to hear it, sonney2k asks me constantly to leave team
 blackburn	he even suggested some money
 gsomix	blackburn, huh, how many? ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what?

@sonney2k	gsomix, actually it should enable us to do sth like x+=y (when x and y are e.g. RealFeatures)
 gsomix	n4nd0, huh, no :)

 blackburn	hey
 puffin444	So currently I have a pull request for ARD kernels
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen I added some very basic structure?
 blackburn	to tutorial
 puffin444	I have just added ARD into the parameter selection framework. It's done, but I need to make sure the code is commented and stuff.
 puffin444	My question is that should I just close the current pull request and add a new one today/tomorrow with the new ARD learning attached?
 blackburn	puffin444: I don't mind either way :)
 blackburn	puffin444: if this one doesn't break compilation I am ok to merge
 puffin444	The one up there now will not break compilation.
 blackburn	what is ARD btw?
 puffin444	I frankly don't know what it stands for :), but it essentially gives to a weight to each feature. That we can focus on the features that matter.
 puffin444	Automatic Relevance Determination
