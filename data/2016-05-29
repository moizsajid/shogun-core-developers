@HeikoS	wiking: actually

@HeikoS	wiking: and what about release?
@HeikoS	I think I will start with the GPL stuff soon
@HeikoS	so the way I see this:
@HeikoS	we have a separate repo, that ressembles the shogun directory structure
@HeikoS	but only src/shogun/
@HeikoS	and only .cpp and .h files I guess
@HeikoS	and then these are put into the main repo with submodule?

 sanuj	lisitsyn, hi!, got time?
 lisitsyn	hey
 lisitsyn	yeah
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, see my comments in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221
 sanuj	the error is here https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/133688130#L3869
 lisitsyn	ok well it seems to fail on gcc or ubuntu
 lisitsyn	works on my mac os
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: what was your valgrind output?
 sanuj	i didn't save it
 sanuj	i'll run it again and share it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, valgrind output: http://pastebin.com/WsJsdqBw
 lisitsyn	sanuj: oh ok I think you need -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 lisitsyn	try to rebuild it with that option
 sanuj	lisitsyn, alright

 sanuj	HeikoS, hello
 sanuj	done with code reviews ;)
@HeikoS	sanuj: just checking your cookbook
@HeikoS	btw we are not notified of pushes to PRs
@HeikoS	only if you send a message
@HeikoS	just only realised you udpated it
 sanuj	HeikoS, yeah, i was going to notify you here in a few minutes
 sanuj	i don't know how to add integration data for GMM notebook
 sanuj	HeikoS, it keeps changing
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ping
 lisitsyn	sanuj: hey
 sanuj	lisitsyn, http://pastebin.com/eArCPE4h
 lisitsyn	oh that's much more detailed :)
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	sanuj: added some comments
@HeikoS	GMM is almost good to go :)
 sanuj	yeah saw
@HeikoS	gotta go
@HeikoS	will check later

 lisitsyn	sanuj: currently all tags have the same id
 lisitsyn	which is zero
 sanuj	lisitsyn, yeah i wanted to ask about that
 lisitsyn	I am not sure if that's causing segfault but that should be fixed somehow
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how to generate unique id everytime?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, also what is the use of fire_update()
 lisitsyn	I don't think it is possible
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you can drop it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and Context?
 lisitsyn	yeah drop it too
 lisitsyn	not used now
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what about ids in tags
 sanuj	lisitsyn, without context we won't be able to get by tag.id
 sanuj	but i think it's not needed
 lisitsyn	yeah drop it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, drop ids in tags too?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: that's much more difficult question :D
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	with ids we are doomed to have some collsions
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how does std::unordered_map makes hashes?
 sanuj	:P
 sanuj	lisitsyn, purpose of id is to make tags for efficient right? or is there more to it?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no just performance
 lisitsyn	sanuj: well it rehashes int, some fast thing
 sanuj	lisitsyn, it only makes sense if we use something faster than std::unordered_map for generating hash
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i used string as keys in my prototype but it's not possible here :P
 lisitsyn	sanuj: strings are ok
 lisitsyn	sanuj: although
 lisitsyn	would it be possible to have multiple parameters with the same name
 lisitsyn	but different type?

 sanuj	lisitsyn, use tags as keys
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah but they are typed
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but doing this is not good
 lisitsyn	sanuj: lets add some base class for tags
 lisitsyn	which is not typed
 lisitsyn	not a template I mean
 lisitsyn	so the map would become
 lisitsyn	std::unordered_map<BaseTag, Any>
 sanuj	lisitsyn, static_cast tag to basetag for map key?
 lisitsyn	yeah some kind of
 lisitsyn	you don't need to do that explicitly
 sanuj	I see
 sanuj	lisitsyn, sounds brilliant, if it works
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do we need id then in tag?
 lisitsyn	not sure
 lisitsyn	probably no
@thoralf	Heyhey.
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and BaseTag will be an empty class?
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hey
 lisitsyn	sanuj: basetag would have a name
 lisitsyn	rather tag<T> would become rather empty
 lisitsyn	it is just a typed version of basetag
 sanuj	lisitsyn, shift name from tag to basetag
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you think this will solve the segfault?
 lisitsyn	not sure but this would resolve further problems
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay!
 sanuj	i'll implement this tomorrow
 sanuj	need to send a cookbook patch now
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah ok
 lisitsyn	sure
-!- thoralf [~thoralf@ip5b418944.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de] has quit [Quit: Konversation terminated!]
 sanuj	lisitsyn, just wanted to confirm
 sanuj	we are using d-pointers for binary compatibility?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, because in new shogun, all the parameters will be saved in a private class pointed by d-pointer?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah maybe we can use that
 lisitsyn	sanuj: it compiles a bit faster
 lisitsyn	a few advantages
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	currently dpointers are included in my PR, taken from aer
 lisitsyn	sanuj: we actually already have 'Unique' in shogun
 lisitsyn	you can drop dptr class
 lisitsyn	and use Unique
 sanuj	oh, alright
