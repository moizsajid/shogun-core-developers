 lisitsyn	thoralf: hey
 thoralf	Hey lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I see some singleton issue :)
 thoralf	Yeah. :)
 thoralf	I opened the battle.
 thoralf	Wanna join? ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: actually we can go ahead and just make shogun itself instantiable
 lisitsyn	run multiple shoguns :D
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	Yeah, that's true.
 lisitsyn	well that's natural extension
 thoralf	We would loose that.
 lisitsyn	everything that's single will get multiple
 lisitsyn	somebody wise should have said that before I bet
 lisitsyn	like karl marx haha
 thoralf	lol
 lisitsyn	OpenSSL is written by monkeys https://www.peereboom.us/assl/assl/html/openssl.html
 lisitsyn	can't resist to share
 thoralf	Hahah.
 lisitsyn	ah and if anybody is interested I dumped my c++ssy brain again
 lisitsyn	http://sergey.lisitsyn.me/2014/04/08/actions-with-raii/
 thoralf	lisitsyn: The monkey-story is great.
 thoralf	tl;sr;
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yeah they sucked a big time
 lisitsyn	our bugs lead to wrong nothing
 lisitsyn	but their bugs are like important :)
 thoralf	Yeah. :)
 thoralf	But really, I still don't know why every object needs to have all this crap.  I never used serialization *or* model-selection *or* parameter framework to compare objects.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: they should have one thing
 lisitsyn	shogun instance ;)
 lisitsyn	which has vresion parallel etc
 thoralf	I was about to fork shogun and rip it of.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: it is a known syndrome
 thoralf	Or making it de-configurable by -DDISABLE_PARAMETER and -DDISABLE_MODEL_SELECTION.
 thoralf	Yeah.
 thoralf	I decided against forking, because I want better code... not worse. ;)
 lisitsyn	it is called shogun forking disorder
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sometimes referred as shogunophrenia
 thoralf	ophrenia?
 thoralf	You're suffering this as well?
 lisitsyn	well I am mentally disabled since I got ill
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sometimes I walk into walls
 lisitsyn	ok actually yes everybody in shogun wanted to rewrite this f'ing s't
 thoralf	Hmm.  So why are we (everybody except me) putting more sh't in instead of removing it?
 thoralf	Well, wiking is good in consolidating I guess.
 lisitsyn	have you seen my commits lately? ;)
 thoralf	And cleaning up.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: You're still committing?
 thoralf	I thought you're just hanging up here because you're used to. :D
 lisitsyn	not really :D
 lisitsyn	not really to both
 thoralf	Are you using shogun somewhere?
 lisitsyn	no :)
 lisitsyn	that's a major point
 thoralf	lol
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I have nothing to use it for
 lisitsyn	thoralf: but I am not just hanging up I am just sloooooow
 thoralf	That's a bad starting point for discussing improvements. ;)
 lisitsyn	I am sloowly getting to some solution for modular shogun
 lisitsyn	that's what I devote my life for hahah
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I use it pretty rarely but nothing advanced
 lisitsyn	well though I have some vague understanding what our users need
 lisitsyn	so you are mostly right ;)
 thoralf	:D
 thoralf	So does it mean you're joining the battle to improve something that has no effect on you? ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I am pretty far away from all the battles
 lisitsyn	thoralf: well I have some idea how software should look like - that's what I am based on
 thoralf	A good-code based life form? :)
 thoralf	I know carbon-based life forms... they don't perform well.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I am not sure what you mean ;) I don't put my opinion on things that affect user experience
 lisitsyn	if someone says X would be better I would believe that
 thoralf	Hmm.  Interesting approach.
 thoralf	Saves a lot of hassle.
 lisitsyn	so I believe I am not that harmful ;)

 lisitsyn	we need kaggle team
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking: besser82: lambday: sonne|work: we need kaggle team!
 lambday	lisitsyn: who's competing? :-o
 wiking	lisitsyn: for which task?
 lisitsyn	wiking: any
 wiking	https://www.kaggle.com/c/risky-business
 wiking	?
 wiking	:)
 wiking	we cannot do that ;P
 lisitsyn	well small steps
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	we can just start from these simple test tasks
 wiking	https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge
 lisitsyn	that's the way we can improve our API
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: I agree :)
 wiking	lisitsyn: let's start a python notebook ;)
 wiking	*ipython
 wiking	for the task
 wiking	)
 wiking	that would be the best i think
 HeikoS1	wiking: I agree :)
 wiking	lisitsyn: new repo?
 wiking	shogun-kaggle ?
 lisitsyn	yes
 lambday	sounds great!
 lisitsyn	let me create that
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking: besser82: lambday: sonne|work: ok and another thing - we have to get distributed
 wiking	lisitsyn: hah u were faster :)
 wiking	lisitsyn: what do u mean? :)
 wiking	lisitsyn: btw we would need a team as well
 wiking	i mean on kaggle
 lisitsyn	yes
 wiking	i have a kaggle account
 wiking	anybody else?
 lisitsyn	I have
 lambday	I do
 lisitsyn	hmm guys
 lisitsyn	just an idea
 lisitsyn	can we create some roles in our team?
 wiking	like?
 lisitsyn	hmm e.g. HeikoS knows about X
 lisitsyn	and you wiking know about Y
 lisitsyn	so we delegate responsibilitie
 lisitsyn	I have vague idea but want to share
 lisitsyn	:D
 wiking	k
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok actually may be we should denote maintainers for modules
 lisitsyn	what do you think about that?
 wiking	sounds like a plan
 wiking	btw anybody has a fucking dashboard on kaggle? )
 lisitsyn	I mean I should be responsible for multiclass things
 lisitsyn	and everybody should kick me to care about that
 wiking	yeah that'd be good
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	okay may be we can go on later
 wiking	so that we dont have scary merges
 lisitsyn	I have no clue what's the dashboard on kaggle
 wiking	me neither
 wiking	ok fuck
 wiking	i've found it :D
 wiking	anybody care to give me his kaggle account?
 wiking	or rather the email addr u use for kaggle?
 lambday	wiking: mine is heavensdevil6909@gmail.com
 lambday	rahul-de is the username
 wiking	lisitsyn: ping?
 lisitsyn	my login is no-idea
 lisitsyn	just a sec
 wiking	lisitsyn: email u used for kaggle
 lisitsyn	I feel idiot when clicking forgot username
 lisitsyn	:D
 wiking	lambday: u should receive an email
 lambday	got it
 lisitsyn	wiking: lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com
 wiking	lisitsyn: sent the invite
 wiking	seems we cannot have permanent teams
 wiking	only per competition teams
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	really?
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah seems like
 lambday	holy crap that's a long list of rules
 lisitsyn	sucks
 wiking	heheh accept it
 wiking	:)
 lambday	yeah did :D
 wiking	ok so now we have a team
 wiking	and we can do submissions
 lambday	only the outputs are to be submitted iirc
 wiking	yep
 wiking	so now the task is pretty easy
 lisitsyn	yeah win it
 lisitsyn	that's the easy part
 lambday	$50k
 wiking	i mean read in file
 wiking	and the output file creator
 wiking	that's like step -1
 lisitsyn	...
 lisitsyn	profit
 lisitsyn	:D
 wiking	:D
 wiking	and then we'll see the rest
 wiking	btw any ideas of the structure for the repo ?
 wiking	like each competition a separate directory?
 lisitsyn	competition-name/...
 lisitsyn	yeah
 wiking	and the data should be always like
 wiking	competiton-name/data directory
 wiking	since we are not allowed to distribute the data
 lisitsyn	uhmm github will kill us
 lisitsyn	if we put data
 wiking	so everybody has to download that for ourselves
 lisitsyn	yeah
 wiking	lisitsyn: nana we are not allowed i think
 lambday	btw why notebook? I mean the data is usually *H-U-G-E*..
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah we are not allowed as well
 wiking	lambday: well the notebook was just for having a great way to present our solution already
 wiking	so it's not just messy code
 lambday	alrighty
 wiking	but somebody can right away like check the whole solution
 wiking	of course it'll make things much more complicated
 wiking	so maybe it's not the good idea
 wiking	as honestly coding and doing experiments with a notebook
 wiking	i think is a bit pain...
 lambday	we need to submit multiple solutions with different approaches..
 lambday	and the best one is our score
 wiking	lambday: well that's easy
 wiking	random()
 wiking	:D
 wiking	that'll put us somewhere on the leaderboard already :PPP
 lambday	lol...
 lisitsyn	ah guys
 lisitsyn	language?
 lambday	doesn't matter
 wiking	yeah that's what i was about to ask
 lisitsyn	hmm matters
 wiking	go hardcore and do everything in c++
 lisitsyn	hahah
 lisitsyn	no
 wiking	or be more subtle and python
 wiking	?
 lisitsyn	python
 wiking	yeah i'm for python as well
 lambday	will take ages to process GBs of data
 wiking	lambday: where do u see the gigs of data?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	10 mb
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	5.63mb train
 lisitsyn	2.02 test
 lambday	last competition I participated in had 500MB compressed data
 lisitsyn	that's not big data
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	this one is easy then :D
 lambday	python +1
 wiking	l-rw-r--r-- 1 wiking staff  46M Feb 18 09:37 train.csv
 lisitsyn	oops
 lisitsyn	I told you zip
 wiking	so the first thing we need to do is fix the readline :)))))
 lisitsyn	I can start with IO actually
 HeikoS1	just talked to dino, who is also interested
 lisitsyn	tonight
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: are you in?
-!- sejDino [~rudo@cpc1-dals14-2-0-cust31.hari.cable.virginm.net] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	hey sejDino
 wiking	ok please register on kaggle and give me email addr that u used for registering on kaggle.com
 wiking	so i can invite u guys to the team
 lambday	sejDino: hi :)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: yes I would like to join this stuff
 sejDino	hey!
 HeikoS1	good way to make shogun more usable for some more applied things :)
 lisitsyn	okay employ more guys and we will win
 lisitsyn	:D
 wiking	:D
 HeikoS1	I guess we will come up with a list of things that would be useful to have and discover loads of bugs ;)
 lisitsyn	we need a tracker
 lisitsyn	to distribute tasks and so on
 lisitsyn	who's up to use github?
 wiking	lisitsyn: github/issues and create a new label called kaggle?
 wiking	or since it's a different repo
 wiking	we can do that there
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle/issues
 lisitsyn	created milestone
 lisitsyn	and label
 wiking	and if we need to fix a bug within shogun because we found it because of kaggle task we can still label it kaggle
 wiking	so that we know what might be a priority bug to fix
 wiking	and for later statistics
 wiking	to see how many bugs we actually found/fixed because of kaggling
 wiking	lisitsyn: sounds like a plan
 sejDino	so is the plan to go for allstate challenge or risky business or both? :)
 wiking	sejDino: we cannod to risky business
 wiking	as it's only for master members of kaggle
 wiking	and none of us has that XP points on kaggle :P
 wiking	sejDino: but we can do other 'educational' task as well
 sejDino	I see - oh, well - now we'll start building those XP pts quickly :)
 wiking	just to promote shogun
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle/issues
 wiking	lisitsyn: is on fire
 sejDino	that sounds like a good idea as well
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle/issues/2
 lisitsyn	dump your mind here
 lisitsyn	who's up describing the input /output data?
 lisitsyn	in the #2
 lisitsyn	sooo whoo
 lisitsyn	do we need a cluster?
 wiking	lisitsyn: no ... worst case we use fatbot :P
 wiking	teh amount of data is really not so much
 lisitsyn	wiking: want to describe dataset?
 wiking	665250 data/train.csv
 wiking	-1 because it has header
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah sure i'm up for that
 lisitsyn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle/issues/3
 lisitsyn	sejDino: HeikoS: HeikoS1: you are scientific guys
 lisitsyn	so waiting your input https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-kaggle/issues/2
 lisitsyn	;)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: happy to do :) Ill talk to sejDino a bit later today and then well give some output
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: assigned you responsible for this issue ;)
 sejDino	lisitsyn: yep, will work on it :)
 lisitsyn	ok that's going much funny now
 lisitsyn	:D
 sejDino	it seems like an interesting problem actually - each customer samples a bunch of these "options" and then they pick one of those (or a new one)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: okay lets organize it this way
 sejDino	so it's not really a standard classification/regression task
 lisitsyn	we discuss it in #2
 lisitsyn	then everything that is worth trying
 lisitsyn	is forked to a new task
 lisitsyn	agree?
 sejDino	lisitsyn: sounds good
 lisitsyn	sejDino: cool thanks
 lisitsyn	lambday: mind to start notebook?
 lisitsyn	or other words
 lisitsyn	want to be responsible for notebook?
 lisitsyn	;)
 lambday	lisitsyn: what should we start with?
 lambday	yeah I can do that
 lisitsyn	lambday: hmm okay actually
 lisitsyn	you could create some draft
 lisitsyn	and make sure everybody can work on notebook in one click
 wiking	lambday: use the template and put it in shogun-kaggle/allstate
 lisitsyn	so makefile or sth like that
 wiking	lambday: and u can have the assumption that the data is in shogun-kaggle/allstate/data
 lisitsyn	I want to organize it that way
 lisitsyn	so we have some 'library'
 lisitsyn	that is used in notebook
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah
 lisitsyn	so we can hide some routine things
 lisitsyn	load_dataset()
 lisitsyn	that's it
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i think all the .py + ipynb should be in shogun-kaggle/allstate
 lisitsyn	yes
 wiking	and then u can from . import load_dataset
 lisitsyn	okay will be back a bit later
 wiking	in the notebook
 lisitsyn	yes
 wiking	lisitsyn: thing is though
 wiking	lisitsyn: this dataset is more or less a timeline
 wiking	lisitsyn: so actually a pandas dataframe would be the best option to store the data ;)
 wiking	not CFeatures of any kind
 wiking	although this is just the first thought i had now looking at the dataset
 wiking	bbl

 pl8787	I think add a subclass of CFeatures may solve this problem. Such as CIndexFeatures
 pl8787	If CIndexFeatures pass in CCustom::init, we just change the subset of the kernel matrix, and then get_kernel_matrix will return the right value.

 sunil1337	lambday: hey!
 lambday	sunil1337: hi!
 sunil1337	lambday: please review https://github.com/sunil1337/shogun/commit/ef30f622df44ab51cb97c4a66c5ea3a673348dfe
 lambday	sunil1337: checking
 sunil1337	lambday: okay! fails at compiling class_list.cpp because we have 3 defs of eigen3 and naive. need a work around there
 lambday	3 defs of eigen3 and naive?
 sunil1337	lambday: partial specialization they py scripts adds them to class_list.cpp
 sunil1337	lambday:*the
 lambday	sunil1337: you could have just left the sparse thing for now
 lambday	the code won't be same for dense and sparse
 lambday	as in, we can't use map
 sunil1337	lambday: yeah.. i just called existing sparse_dot for now
 sunil1337	lambday: i've commented the problem please take a look
 lambday	okie
 lambday	sunil1337: could you please split the definition and declarations?
 lambday	into separate .h and .cpp
 lambday	each class - one .h one .cpp
 sunil1337	lambday: sure..
 wiking	btw u could use macros
 sunil1337	wiking: for new calls ?
 lambday	sunil1337: umm you didn't need to add VectorDotOperator already... first just VectorDotProduct and Eigen3DotProduct which would work independently
 lambday	then we would add CLinearAlgebra factory class
 lambday	after that we'll add VectorDotOperator
 lambday	under LinearOperator interface
 lambday	this iterative approach makes it easy to find bugs
 lambday	Naive - we don't really need.. I just added in the gist for demonstration purpose
 sunil1337	lambday: okay! :)
 lambday	this looks good :)
 lambday	good work :)
 sunil1337	lambday: thanks :) naive is already there in existing SGVector class...
 lambday	but if you could please send patches containing those two first
 lambday	it would make it so much easier
 sunil1337	lambday: will do.. :)
 lambday	yeah - no one needs a sophisticated interface to do naive things ;)
 sunil1337	lambday: :)
 lambday	sunil1337: we *don't* need to put VectorDotProduct under SGObject

 lambday	and please avoid using __ in #ifndef __CLASSNAME_H__... make it #ifndef CLASSNAME_H_
 sunil1337	lambday: okay :)
 thoralf	Hey.
 lambday	thoralf: hi...
 lambday	thoralf: where are we about the singleton issue?
 thoralf	lambday: We didn't decide anything... currently we're collecting arguments. ;)
 thoralf	lambday: Do you have an optinion about it?

 thoralf	lisitsyn: Awake?
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yes
 thoralf	Hello :)
 thoralf	I just realized we're having global variables anyway and are just copying them to each object.
 thoralf	So it does means we cannot have multiple shoguns even right now.
 thoralf	And the difference between global variables and singletons is artificial for this discussion. ;)
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	we have it tied together already
 thoralf	We're doomed anyway.  So let's change it while everybody is sleeping. :D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: what exactly?
 lisitsyn	I am completely lost in discussions
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	Removing SGIO, Version, Parallel members from CSGObject.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: want to do that?
 lisitsyn	;)
 thoralf	Wrong question.
 thoralf	Want to write a ticket for that? :D
 lisitsyn	ahh students
 lisitsyn	thoralf: that's the same thing happens at my job
 lisitsyn	constantly forgetting I have 3 programmers to delegate job
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: To me honest, I'm a bit lost how to improve this "thing" and I want to discuss which options we have (without making it worse by adding another 1000 classes).
 thoralf	Changing it would only be the technical part.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I think making SGContext a singleton first
 lisitsyn	would work
 thoralf	I have no concerns about this.
 thoralf	Putting Version, Parallel, SGIO into it.
 thoralf	Most functionality on these things is based on macros, so easy to change without touching many classes.
 lisitsyn	yeah
 thoralf	And then we would naturally lose the duplication of SG_SINFO/SG_INFO, etc., because everything is depending on the singleton.
 lisitsyn	uh
 thoralf	What?  Did I miss something?
 lisitsyn	well if we don't want multiple contexts
 lisitsyn	it should work
 lisitsyn	I overlooked the SG_SINFO/SG_INFO thing
 lisitsyn	thoralf: if we use the singleton in SG_INFO
 lisitsyn	this member of SGObject makes no sense
 lisitsyn	won't be used
 thoralf	Yes.
 thoralf	So we can remove it.  Hooray :)
 lisitsyn	this denies multiple contexts
 lisitsyn	I would be ok with multiple contexts
 lisitsyn	so that's disputable
 thoralf	Okay, how would it work with multiple contexts?
 thoralf	Lets say, you have machine1 from context1 and machine2 from context2.  How would each machine create a new CLabel of the right context?
 lisitsyn	we should ask for labels in context
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	that sounds like a factory
 thoralf	Yeah.
 thoralf	Sounds like JavaEE
 thoralf	CLabels l = context.register(new CLabels);
 thoralf	vs
 thoralf	CLabels l = context.getInstanceOf(class CLabels);
 lisitsyn	thoralf: actually there is a lot of beauty in that :D
 lisitsyn	makes things really extensible
 lisitsyn	thoralf: if we go modular
 lisitsyn	we'd need factories anyway
 thoralf	Correct me if I'm wrong, but this doesn't make things simpler. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: this makes things extensible ;)
 thoralf	Correct me if I'm wrong, but this doesn't make things simpler. ;)
 thoralf	lol, okay.
 thoralf	No free lunch.
 lisitsyn	well the simplest thing is no objects
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	but the issue is that we really need factories to go modular
 lisitsyn	say I wrote SuperSVM
 lisitsyn	how do I spawn it?
 lisitsyn	there is no SuperSVM in headers/interfaces
 lisitsyn	I can only ask for SVM
 lisitsyn	(effectively)
 thoralf	Damn.

 thoralf	You're playing in the opposite team.
 thoralf	I'm on simplification (white circle on white background)
 thoralf	You're on, well, you're on maximum extensible. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: we need plugins
 lisitsyn	to not wait \infty before it compiles
 lisitsyn	and to use only what you want :)
 lisitsyn	plugins are not only about extensibility but to put development on speed
 thoralf	Hmm.
 thoralf	But this involves *many* design decisions that haven't been met.  For example: simple "data" classes like vectors, matrices, etc. that need to be fast.  No need to ask daddy every time you want to create an instance.
 lisitsyn	but they are not sgobjects, right?
 thoralf	Hmm.
 thoralf	Hmm!
 thoralf	Yes.
 lisitsyn	I am talking only about sgobjects because they are not lightweight
 lisitsyn	and never been :)
 thoralf	I got your point.
 lisitsyn	okay destination bed
 thoralf	Good night.
