 gsomix	n4nd0, hey. how are you?
 n4nd0	gsomix: I'm fine, making my way through SQL :)
 n4nd0	gsomix: what about you?
 gsomix	n4nd0, bored. I'm doing homework.
 n4nd0	gsomix: what class?
 gsomix	n4nd0, analytical mechanics (I recently found out what is the difference from theoretical mechanics).
 n4nd0	no idea about that :O
 gsomix	theoretical mechanics in russian education == applied mechanics. calculations of beams, mechanisms and other
 gsomix	n4nd0, what about SL
 gsomix	*SQL?
 n4nd0	gsomix: it is not bad, I am just learning the basics though
 n4nd0	so I won't probably get to know the usefulness of it
 n4nd0	gsomix: do you sth about it?
 n4nd0	do you know*

 blackburn_	n4nd0: havin' troubles with sql? :)
 n4nd0	blackburn_: not really troubles, just going through the beginning of the learning curve :)
 blackburn_	I see
 n4nd0	the problem is that I don't find it very interesting this far
 blackburn_	useful skill I'd say
 n4nd0	I am not very motivated :(
 n4nd0	blackburn_: do you think so?
 blackburn_	yeap
 blackburn_	can you mind any other way to operate on some data?
 n4nd0	with search engines
 blackburn_	but how do they work then? :)
 n4nd0	AFAIK they are not built on databases
 blackburn_	what should it be then?
 blackburn_	anyway once you have some complex data you would meet some database usually
 n4nd0	I would like to see an environment where they are useful
 blackburn_	any enterprise application
 blackburn_	or even any application working with data
 n4nd0	put me an example of what you mean with application working with data
 blackburn_	what about twitter?
 blackburn_	facebook?
 blackburn_	aren't they built on top of database?
 n4nd0	they probable store all the info in databases yes
 blackburn_	yes specialized sometimes
 blackburn_	some kind of nosql sometimes
 blackburn_	how would you do any website with authorization?
 blackburn_	everything you can come up instead of database is some DYI database
 n4nd0	I am not familiarized with DYI database
 blackburn_	I mean it will be 'do it yourself' stuff
 blackburn_	:)
 blackburn_	there is really no other way to store data
 blackburn_	retrieve/change/etc
 blackburn_	any other attempt would lead to another database
 n4nd0	let's see if I get some motivation from there
 blackburn_	n4nd0: just imagine how difficult it would be to store some say orders
 n4nd0	orders?
 blackburn_	how would you approach it?
 blackburn_	yes some orders of some clients
 blackburn_	they like to have something
 blackburn_	:D
 n4nd0	have to reboot
 n4nd0	brb

 blackburn_	n4nd0: so the simplest case - you want a website to sell plush bears
 n4nd0	blackburn_: yeah
 blackburn_	there is a form to store clients data like address, quantity etc
 blackburn_	how would you approach it (w/o database)?
 blackburn_	clients enter their data to order your bears and they actually do not care how it works
 n4nd0	blackburn_: yes, one needs a database for that
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@vir78-1-82-232-38-145.fbx.proxad.net] has quit [Read error: No route to host]
 blackburn_	I'd say there could be a way to store that in files or so
 blackburn_	but what is it in fact?
 n4nd0	but I don't find that very interesting :P
 blackburn_	just some lame database
 n4nd0	yes, that would be to re-invent the wheel
 blackburn_	99% of websites are like this one
-!- Marty28 [~marty@158.181.78.199] has joined #shogun
 blackburn_	n4nd0: in principle you could say 'I don't like websites' :)
 n4nd0	blackburn_: c'mon that's not the same
 blackburn_	what is the difference between plush bears web store and facebook?
 blackburn_	I'd say the only difference is some distributed databases and more complex technology and nothing more
 blackburn_	n4nd0: can you list any? :)
 n4nd0	blackburn_: I see more people spending time on facebook than on teddy bears webs
 blackburn_	n4nd0: but we are discussing technologies right?
 n4nd0	so there must be some difference apart from the way their databases are constructed :P
 n4nd0	got me ...
 blackburn_	n4nd0: no it is databases still

 blackburn_	n4nd0: and you should know that SQL queries are being optimized before running
 blackburn_	there is a pretty big theory of databases and it allows you to retrieve data pretty fast
 blackburn_	moreover there are some things like transactions and user rights
 blackburn_	you would need all these things at some point
 n4nd0	it looks like something pretty big there
 blackburn_	and doing it once again is too hard for anyone
 blackburn_	n4nd0: are you familiar with joins?
 n4nd0	blackburn_: I have studied them in the course, but I wouldn't say I am very familiar with them
 blackburn_	n4nd0: can you write it in say C++?
 blackburn_	I would definitely fuck up with it
 blackburn_	but it is really needed sometimes and if you avoid databases you have to write it by yourself at some point
 blackburn_	so even if you need only a map of login/hash of password
 blackburn_	once you would need to extend it or retrieve some custom data
 n4nd0	I think you convinced me about the usefulness of it
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn_	n4nd0: hehe yeah I told you a lot of things
 blackburn_	n4nd0: at the place I work (netcracker) - we develop crazy-complex operational support system
 blackburn_	it is pretty flexible and all the entities can be described by java objects
 blackburn_	however these java objects can't be really used to store data
 blackburn_	for example transactions would be pretty impossible
 blackburn_	and once you power off server you lost orders/clients data and lost money
-!- Marty28 [~marty@158.181.78.199] has quit [Quit: Colloquy for iPad - http://colloquy.mobi]
 blackburn_	so the only way is to build system on top of some robust database like oracle

@sonney2k	n4nd0, hey - did you have time to do the benchmark?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: not yet, sorry :(
@sonney2k	ahh too bad
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I hope you find some too
 n4nd0	I am fighting against a lab for one of my exams but I think I will get some by tomorrow afternoon
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ahh btw it would also be great if you can fix the warnings http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/509/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%2830%29
@sonney2k	they are all in your area ...
 n4nd0	sure
@sonney2k	n4nd0, when are your exams?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: 26th, 28th and on May 7th
-!- karlnapf [~heiko@host86-181-81-47.range86-181.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0, saturday even?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, thx for the patch!
 karlnapf	sonney2k, np :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, some microwaves for Saturday
 karlnapf	sonney2k, stay tuned for the subset stacks, just fixing the last tests
@sonney2k	karlnapf, does that error make sense to you http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/ruby_modular/builds/504/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	I was just looking at the buildbot output so forgive me all for nagging
@sonney2k	karlnapf, great!
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes I think that has to do with the non-generic stuff, I have deleted one type
-!- Marty28 [~marty@158.181.78.199] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	I will check that as soon I am done with my current stuff
@sonney2k	karlnapf, k
@sonney2k	thx
@sonney2k	so tomorrow is the day and around 19:00 UTC we will all have some answers
 karlnapf	sonney2k, you are talking to me? :)
 karlnapf	if yes: what? :)
-!- Marty28 [~marty@158.181.78.199] has quit [Quit: Colloquy for iPad - http://colloquy.mobi]
 n4nd0	I think I'll start to get nervous tomorrow :O
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no need to - all students are already assigned :P
 karlnapf	sonney2k, do you know of any memory leaks in stream features?
 karlnapf	I get some for v_array
 karlnapf	wondering if they are my fault
 n4nd0	karlnapf: I also got some once I used them
 karlnapf	n4nd0, ok, where? I am getting them in the classifier_multiclasslinearmachine
 karlnapf	example
 n4nd0	yeah I think it was in this one, let me check
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@vir78-1-82-232-38-145.fbx.proxad.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	yes, it was there
 karlnapf	n4nd0, ok then
 karlnapf	thats not my thing currently :)
 karlnapf	I will perhaps write a bugreport
 n4nd0	yeah do that
 n4nd0	I remember I commented it when I did that pull request
 n4nd0	but I do not quite recall whether I opened an issue
 karlnapf	ok I will check that first :)
 n4nd0	karlnapf: it was in the PR you helped me with a warning by the way
 n4nd0	karlnapf: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/401
 karlnapf	oh year, I remember
 karlnapf	I think we should check memory leaks in the tests automatically
 karlnapf	there might be more :)
 n4nd0	yeah, it is a good idea
@sonney2k	karlnapf, about your subset stack
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes?
@sonney2k	it is attached to labels / features / whatever object?
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	like the old one
@sonney2k	and then labels/features etc can just do a query -> subset_stack give me element i?
 karlnapf	yes, nothing has changed interface wise (except for names)
 karlnapf	but now if you do multiple add_subset(), you have subsets of subsets instead of replacing
@sonney2k	and subsetstack has some precomputed (cached) merged subset index that it will look up in a table?
 karlnapf	so you have to remove everytime you add
 karlnapf	yes
@sonney2k	karlnapf, remove in the same order then right?
 karlnapf	actually, it stores all the "active" subsets of the stack
@sonney2k	karlnapf, wait so you can have many at the same time?
 karlnapf	so that deleting one does not require to recompute
 karlnapf	nono
 karlnapf	just for performance
@sonney2k	karlnapf, what is a 'active' subset?
 karlnapf	active subset is the merged
 karlnapf	everytime you add another subset, that  one is merged with the active
 karlnapf	and put on stack
 karlnapf	if you remove, you got the old active
 karlnapf	and if you add this active is merged again
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I see makes a lot of sense
 karlnapf	it might become slow for many subsets otherwise
 karlnapf	at the cost of memory, but thats not too much
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I hope we won't have too many subsets but well this kind of cache won't hurt
@sonney2k	yeah it is not too much
@sonney2k	and disabling this would be easy if required
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	if this stuff works, some things might be simplified
 karlnapf	some of the locking stuff perhaps
 karlnapf	and multiclass machine
 karlnapf	ah and xval with  multiclass machine is now possible
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I am happy with the patch ... it is too big to see all the consequences - so lets hope the buildbot will catch most issues.

-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.43.52] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	karlnapf, it is very clear that we need this. I also hope that the compiler will take care of not doing another memory access because of the m_subset->do_sth() but instead do_sth() immediately
 karlnapf	yes, all the methods are inline, hope that works
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I guess you haven't checked for performance right? I mean it doesn't matter that much for accessing a whole vector but it will hurt when sth like this is implemented for dims / aka sub_dims
 karlnapf	no, no honset performance checks,
 karlnapf	honest
 karlnapf	thats probably expensive
 karlnapf	but the main method is subset_idx_conversion
 karlnapf	of CSubsetStack
 karlnapf	and that is no too much stuff
 karlnapf	one if and one ->
 karlnapf	and of course the m_subset_stack->
@sonney2k	karlnapf, yeah I don't see that we can do better
@sonney2k	probably automagic refcounting would kill us here but with this manual way all good

@sonney2k	karlnapf, it will build every commit
 karlnapf	oh I did not know that thoug it would do the whole merge
@sonney2k	karlnapf, so if an intermediate commit is broken it will complain
 karlnapf	mmh, I like to commit things seperate because then the messages are tidier
@sonney2k	karlnapf, it makes sense doesn't it? If you are looking for regressions you will exactly know which commit is kaboom
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes you are right
@sonney2k	karlnapf, you can just ensure that it still builds
@sonney2k	and if you have to change a huge part of the code because of interdependencies
@sonney2k	well then it should be one commit only in the end (and your can do that with git commit --amend or the git reset magic)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok thanks, will do that in the future
 karlnapf	sonney2k, I have to leave now, have a nice evening! :)
@sonney2k	karlnapf, thanks for the patch
@sonney2k	and hope to see you and all tomorrow 19 UTC :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes, I will try to be there :)

 blackburn_	sonney2k: have you cold some vodka?
 wiking	woooohoooooo
* wiking has a working latent svm !!
 blackburn_	already? hey gsoc is starting tomorrow
 wiking	hehehe who knows if i'm in or not ;P
 wiking	we'll see tomorrow
 wiking	buuuut
 blackburn_	soeren knows
 wiking	the latent svm *is* WORKING!!!
 shogun-buildbot	build #538 of octave_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/538
 blackburn_	wiking: in shogun?
 wiking	blackburn_: yep!
 wiking	not committed yet
 blackburn_	huh then congrats
 wiking	i need to clean up the stuff
 wiking	but it works!!
 wiking	with those examples
 wiking	that i've found yesterday
 blackburn_	visual detection?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	finding mammals
 wiking	within images
 blackburn_	is it some simple window or that deformable model?
 wiking	it's just a simple bounding box
 blackburn_	I see
 blackburn_	what is on your roadmap next?
 wiking	but it depends of course your what's your latent variable...
 wiking	now it was just a simple bounding box
 wiking	well now it's first cleaning the code up
 wiking	and commit it to the latent branch
 wiking	see the reaction of alex
 wiking	and if he is satisfied then i can go further improving
 wiking	one of that would be to integrate a structural svm into it
 wiking	but for that i want to clean up the whole thing with qp solvers within shogun that i've promised for sonney2k
 wiking	and after that comes various improvements to the latent svm solver
 wiking	and of course testing out some own ideas
 wiking	i just needed now a framework where i can work with it
 blackburn_	I see
 blackburn_	that's nice
 wiking	ok so now back to cleaning up the code
 blackburn_	do you mind to provide some sliding window genome analysis latent svm?
 blackburn_	would be cool example too
 wiking	well
 wiking	give me a dataset :D
 blackburn_	I am not the expert you know :)
 wiking	i think i saw a paper that has been investigating this
 wiking	i'll check
 wiking	but yeah this most definitely will need some basic and some very complex example in shogun to demonstrate it's 'power'

 harshit_	hey n4nd0, hows everything going !
 n4nd0	harshit_: hey! pse, just fine, preparing some exams
 n4nd0	harshit_: what about you?
 harshit_	same here, practical exams :(
 harshit_	hate microwaves
 harshit_	n4nd0, Did no programming at all for last 5 days :(  feels as if I am disconnected from the shogun world,lol
 n4nd0	haha not good
 blackburn_	n4nd0: it looks like my defensive speech on databases make you a little quiet :D
 n4nd0	blackburn_: :P yeah I don't complain about it any more
 gsomix	blackburn_, hey. do you want to solve some optics problems for me? :]
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn_	gsomix: yes of course
 blackburn_	I like optics pretty much
 blackburn_	that's my favourite area
 gsomix	blackburn_, orly?
 gsomix	lol
 blackburn_	oh I like it so much
 blackburn_	gsomix: do you really think I understand anything?
 blackburn_	I hardly passed exam I'd say
 n4nd0	blackburn_: I think you forgot to set your *ironic* flag :P
 blackburn_	n4nd0: irc doesn't support this yet :D
 gsomix	blackburn_, yes! I think you have solved all problems from Irodov. :]
 gsomix	hehe, blackburn_ optics is pass/fail exam?
 blackburn_	gsomix: yes
 gsomix	ok
 gsomix	I have mechanics, computer networks and linux programming as pass/fail exams.
 n4nd0	linux programming, that looks like a cool course
 gsomix	I don't think so
 n4nd0	gsomix: really? The name looks promising :)=
 gsomix	this course is about files (open, r/w, chmod) and inter-process communication: pipes, shared memory.
 gsomix	it's a good stuff
 gsomix	but course is boring
 n4nd0	it looks like my operative systems course
 n4nd0	gsomix: do you know what is the worst part of that course in my university? We have to do it in Plan 9
 gsomix	n4nd0, wow, why?
 blackburn_	my memory is strange sometimes - I associate plan 9 with 'gayniggers from the outer space'
* gsomix thinks, that glenda is nya-nya-nya ^__^
 n4nd0	gsomix: the teacher's answer is that it's because linux man pages are unreadable and senseless stuff like that
 n4nd0	gsomix: from my point of view, the reason is that they make research using that OS
 n4nd0	blackburn_: yeah, I think the name comes from a film named like that
 blackburn_	not really like that
 blackburn_	but the original one right?
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn_	something from the outer space
 blackburn_	I do notremember exactly
 blackburn_	but gayniggers is actually way more funnier
 n4nd0	haha
 gsomix	blackburn_, I have not watched this movie yet. :(
 blackburn_	your life is meanless thing then
 n4nd0	two people with meaningless lives then here :D
 n4nd0	ah and another thing that made me laugh a lot
 gsomix	n4nd0, huh. it could be minix, for example :)
 n4nd0	they told me yes but with acme (one of plan 9's editor)
 n4nd0	you can go pretty fast using the mouse and the chords
