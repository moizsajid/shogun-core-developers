 vperic	For all my effort, the python_modular interface doesn't pass any of the tests... I guess the title of "local suse expert" will remain unclaimed for a while more.

 thoralf	Hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	thoralf: hi!
 vperic	HeikoS: Hi! I'm interested in the Shogun missionary GSoC project, I understand you are the person to contact? Do you have any general advice what I could do right now? I'm looking at issue 1907, but the specifics are a bit beyond me (and I'm still trying to get Shogun to run correctly).
@HeikoS	vperic: hey there, yes thats me
@HeikoS	vperic: if you dont know about kernel embeddings of distributions, maybe choose another topic to document
@HeikoS	vperic: there are loads of algorithms in Shogun which we would like to document properly
@HeikoS	vperic: also, some notebooks can be cleaned up or extended, see for example the GMM notebook
 vperic	HeikoS: Right, so it's ok if I just find a suitable task for myself?
@HeikoS	vperic: as this project is about being creative with writing about ML, you should maybe just come up with a suggestion (something you know well)
@HeikoS	vperic: but pls tell me/us before you start to confirm that is a good idea, we dont want you to waste any time on something that is not needed
 vperic	Right, got it. Would you expect a full notebook as the entrance task, or would finding a "smaller bite" somewhere be alright? Considering the deadline and all.
@HeikoS	vperic: best thing is to start with something and then go from there
@HeikoS	vperic: we like to merge in small bits
@HeikoS	vperic: and to discuss a lot around the PRs
@HeikoS	so just send whatever you have
 lisitsyn1	yaa
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: hey there
 vperic	Yeah, I understand. I participated in GSoC once already (on SymPy) so this is all familiar to me. (I'll write an intro mail tomorrow morning I guess)

@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: lets discuss this linear algebra stuff
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: how you doing
@HeikoS	I would like to have that done before gsoc starts
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: good, yourself?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: yeah sure
 lisitsyn1	though I am not in good condition but well why not :D
 lisitsyn1	I don't get some things about that to be honest

 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: well I see one great thing we probably oversee now
 lisitsyn1	how do we handle vectors/matrices already loaded to the GPU
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: i like discussing things, so shoot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: very good point
 lisitsyn1	sgvector is not the thing for that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: impossible to handle with an interface that can easily switch between modes
 lisitsyn1	otherwise we lose a lot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: so what about having some subclasses to do these things?
@HeikoS	you know
@HeikoS	same class but with the "definitely GPU" label
@HeikoS	so that you can choose to use those, and they dont work without GPU, but have same interface as the others
 lisitsyn1	subclasses of what?
@HeikoS	of the std vector operation
 lisitsyn1	dot <- gpu dot?
 lisitsyn1	still the problem is here
 lisitsyn1	if we have an interface that just uses sgvector
 lisitsyn1	we *always* transfer stuff from ram to gpu
@HeikoS	no but the subclass can reimplement that
 lisitsyn1	but if has interface like
@HeikoS	I mean those are instances of classes so they can do whatever they want to produce the result
@HeikoS	not static methods
 lisitsyn1	dot(SGVector a, SGVector b)
 lisitsyn1	SGVector is not capable of having some handle in the gpu memory
@HeikoS	so the gpu class could load the thing into GPU upon construction
 lisitsyn1	right?
@HeikoS	yeah I agree
 lisitsyn1	ahh
 lisitsyn1	so you mean
@HeikoS	but cant we handle that if we dont use static methods?
 lisitsyn1	we need to have linear operators
 lisitsyn1	instead of vectors/matrices
 lisitsyn1	then we are good to do that with gpu
@HeikoS	yeah I guess
@HeikoS	same with convolutions
 lisitsyn1	yeah I get it
@HeikoS	also linear operations
@HeikoS	so same interface
 lisitsyn1	I haven't thought of that actually

 hushell	abinash_panda: I am not sure which way will be good
 hushell	abinash_panda: for any new class, you need to make unit-test first
 hushell	abinash_panda: my suggestion is to follow as possible as other CXXXFile classes
 abinash_panda	abinash_panda: Ok.
 abinash_panda	hushell: One more thing that you have suggested is that I should use CDynamicArray instead of DynArray, right ?
 hushell	abinash_panda: yeah, use classes from shogun/lib not shogun/base
 hushell	abinash_panda: to understand Factor related stuffs, u may want to try examples like example/undocumented/libshogun/so_fg_model.cpp
 abinash_panda	hushell: Ok. I would have a look at it. Thanks for pointing it out.
 hushell	u r welcome
 abinash_panda	hushell: I have a doubt regarding CDynamicArray. Can I create a dynamic array like CDynamicArray<SGVector<int32_t>> ?
 abinash_panda	hushell: If not, then how should I create an array of SGVector<int32_t> ?
 hushell	abinash_panda: well, u meant CDynamicArray< int32_t > ?
 hushell	abinash_panda: why u need an array of SGVector?
 hushell	abinash_panda: maybe u want SGMatrix?
 abinash_panda	hushell: No. I want to store each factors scope in a SGVector<int32_t> and was wondering of any data structure that can store these SGVector<int32_t>s ?
 abinash_panda	hushell: SGMatrix won't be able to suffice the need as I don't know the size of each factor's scope.

 hushell	abinash_panda: if so, CDynamicArray< float64_t > seems good, no need to have 2d array
 hushell	abinash_panda: u can try CDynamicArray< CDynamicArray <> >, haven't do that before
 abinash_panda	abinash_panda: Ok. Let me try that one.
 abinash_panda	hushell: As you can see in the PR that I have sent. I used to save the the factors scope in SGVector<int32_t> vars_index. Then I used to push_bask(vars_index) into the DynArray<SGVector<int32_t>> m_factors_scope.
 abinash_panda	hushell: But, this thing doesn't work when I changed DynArray to CDynamicArray.
 abinash_panda	hushell: You can refer to line 146 to 155 in UAIFile.cpp
 hushell	abinash_panda: std is not somehow compatible with these classes
 abinash_panda	hushell: Sorry, I couldn't get you.
 hushell	sorry I was thinking u r using std
 hushell	abinash_panda: let me have a look
 abinash_panda	Ok
 hushell	abinash_panda: m_factors_scope.push_back(vars_index);
 abinash_panda	hushell: Yeah
 hushell	abinash_panda: I don't think u can push SGVector with different sizes
 abinash_panda	hushell: Ok. But when I had tested the code, it worked fine.
 hushell	abinash_panda: well, I'm not very sure here, but I don't suggest u implement in this way
 hushell	abinash_panda: are u sure it works correctly?
 hushell	abinash_panda: I mean u may be able to compile it
 abinash_panda	hushell: Yeah. It worked correctly. I was able to get all the factors scope.
 abinash_panda	I have compiled and tested the code before sending PR
 hushell	abinash_panda: I haven't use DynamicArray like this before
 hushell	but u can have a try
 hushell	hushell: please add unit-test to the PR
 hushell	abinash_panda: then we'll see
 abinash_panda	hushell: Sorry for the confusion. Initially I have used DynArray which worked fine.
 hushell	not to myself :)
 abinash_panda	hushell: But when I have used CDynamicArray, it gave me error.
 hushell	abinash_panda: u can check the code of DynamicArray, just a wrapper of DynArray
 hushell	abinash_panda: well, basically, usually I use DynamicArray to store a seq of pointers
 abinash_panda	hushell: Ok. So should I go and write the unit test for the current implementation using DynArray and we can see whether there is some bug or not ?
 hushell	abinash_panda: I cannot say much, send out the ur tests, we'll see if it works properly
 abinash_panda	hushell: Ok. I would be sending the tests by tonight. I would be completing my application today.

@HeikoS	yeah?
 bumblebee_	cant understand where to put files to send a pr!! (to silly to ask i guess)
 bumblebee_	as in i have on my independent repo
 bumblebee_	and i have branced a develop branch, but to send a pr, i need to place these files, where in the main repo?
-!- cameo54321 [27294dcf@gateway/web/freenode/ip.39.41.77.207] has left #shogun []
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: which files are you talking about? your code?
 bumblebee_	yes
 bumblebee_	my code
 bumblebee_	i want to send a pr
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: you have to commit them to your local close of your forked repository, then push to your fork, and then send the PR in gituhb
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: google this, its a standard thing
 bumblebee_	yup no issues with that
 bumblebee_	but commit WHERE in my local fork?
 bumblebee_	does that matter?
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: yes, in the shogun source tree
@HeikoS	whereever they belong
@HeikoS	where is the file locally?
 bumblebee_	in shogun/src/shogun/
 bumblebee_	i have made a folder there for my "recomendation_dataset"
 bumblebee_	and just dont want to disturb the main structure? can i send a PR from here.?
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	so what type of code is that?
@HeikoS	you are right, that should not be in the main source tree
@HeikoS	could you put that into a gist for now for me to have a look?
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: I will have a look later today then, currently at work.
 bumblebee_	oh k
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: just put the gist link in the issue
 bumblebee_	sure
 bumblebee_	k
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: looking forward to see this!
 bumblebee_	i will put the link for my repo in the issue?
 bumblebee_	is that fine?
@HeikoS	bumblebee_: no you dont want to commit that, even to your own repo for now
@HeikoS	just put the gist
@HeikoS	then Ill tell you where to put this
 bumblebee_	ohk
 bumblebee_	cheers
 bumblebee_	do let me know!!

 chema	Thanks.
 jiaolong	Is there anyone using astyle?
 jiaolong	I got some error: Invalid command line options:  close-templates align-reference=name
 jiaolong	Then I removed these two options
 jiaolong	Maybe we should update the document? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/doc/md/CodingStyle.md
@wiking	jiaolong: why?
@wiking	what's the rpoblem?
@wiking	ah astyle
@wiking	no idea
 jiaolong	I got some error: Invalid command line options:  close-templates align-reference=name
@wiking	jiaolong: your best option is to comment this
@wiking	in the issue
@wiking	i mean create an issue
@wiking	tell it to thoralf
 jiaolong	OK
@wiking	(@tklein23)
@wiking	as i do not think anybody else would know anything about this
@wiking	except him
 jiaolong	OK, thank you!
@wiking	nw
 jiaolong	I removed these two options and it works well.
@wiking	jiaolong: i hope i'll have a patch from you for libsvmfile soon
 jiaolong	I am doing this work.
 jiaolong	I have to first update my first PR.
 jiaolong	I hope I can finish it today.
@wiking	great! looking forward to it
@wiking	btw that extension of libsvmfile should be fairly trivial ;)
