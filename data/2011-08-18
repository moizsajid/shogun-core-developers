@sonney2k	good morning heiko
-!- heiko [~heiko@134.91.54.64] has quit [Ping timeout: 258 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: he we've got 364 warnings left
@sonney2k	blackburn, and mostly simple ones
@sonney2k	it is about time that I enable make check-examples :)
 blackburn	serialization fixed?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no heiko fled when I said good morning :D
 blackburn	I'm really wondering why there are 5 online here
 blackburn	less than ever
@sonney2k	considering that there are 3 bots in here - yes not a lot
@sonney2k	I guess I shouldn't write positive emails ;-)
@sonney2k	blackburn, once we have make check-examples I will ask everyone again to help fix /port all the examples / bugs
 blackburn	today warnings should lower to <200
@sonney2k	and once serialization migration works I will enable make tests
 blackburn	if it is <200 I will be happy hehe
@sonney2k	I will be happy when all examples run
 blackburn	I'll try to finish kpca today
 blackburn	I hope I understood things right here
 blackburn	a little tricky thing
@sonney2k	if we progress as much as we do currently then it is 2-3 weeks until a release...
@sonney2k	not too bad I would say
 blackburn	I should finish all the serious work before 1st of September
 blackburn	or 5th of September as hard 'deadline'
 blackburn	because it is first day of work :)
 blackburn	as I will be studying and work 'in parallel'
@sonney2k	blackburn, me too actually 31.8 should be our hard deadline
@sonney2k	it is do-able
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would say most important is to check that we did not break anything that worked before
 blackburn	how?
@sonney2k	blackburn, by running make tests when serialization migration works

 CIA-87	shogun: working SGVector serialization (+9 more commits...) - http://bit.ly/oDHWbU
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is elastic net?
@sonney2k	heiko, hi
@sonney2k	again :)
 heiko	sonney2k, hi
@sonney2k	heiko, I am just compiling ...
 heiko	sonney2k, I hope it all works, my tests here went fine - same for the svmlight serial example
@sonney2k	heiko, did you manage to fix the destroy() issue?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes I did
@sonney2k	I looked at your patch - do you create empty SGVectors - no right?
 heiko	where?
 heiko	in new_cont?
@sonney2k	ever
 heiko	what I basically did is:
 heiko	there is already code which does the MALLOC/FREE stuff for arrays/matrices
 heiko	but the pointer was wrong when using SGMatrix
@sonney2k	you mean double* ptrs
 heiko	it pointed to the method
 heiko	I now simply changed the pointer the the vector/matrix address
@sonney2k	you mean it pointed to the object right?
@sonney2k	heiko, wouldn't it be better to really use the contructor in this case of SGVector etc?
 heiko	this would be possible
 heiko	but then I would have to write this for every type
 heiko	this way, I could simply reuse the old code
 heiko	which already works, if the pointer is correct
@sonney2k	heiko, so what are the assumption when doing this...
* blackburn hates libshogunui
 heiko	sonney2k, ?
@sonney2k	1) the SGVector is correctly initialized before it is being messed with
 heiko	yes, but NULL also works
@sonney2k	2) there is nothing going on after the vector has been set (whatever processing etc)
 heiko	oh you mean, the SGVector has to be there
 heiko	this is true
 heiko	how do you mean 2)
 heiko	?
@sonney2k	blackburn, fix siwg's R wrapper and implement matlab-swig support then it will go
@sonney2k	heiko, think of something more complicated than SGCachedVector - where the vector is put somewhere / or processed
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is ok if you finish by the end of today :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I plan to finish it in a min
@sonney2k	blackburn, as always - you are the man :)
@bettyboo	he!?!
 heiko	sonney2k, currently, the SGVector is treated like a class variable.
 heiko	only the content is changed
@sonney2k	heiko, yes
@sonney2k	I have mixed feelings about this - this will cause trouble at some point
 heiko	Well, I could change this
 heiko	but it would not be possible to add class member SGVectors then
 heiko	because they are deleted
 heiko	from stack memory
 heiko	Currently, all SGVector replacements are on stack
-!- in3xes__ [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	heiko, if you do class->vector = SGVector x(some_memory, len)?
@sonney2k	ahh not working because not public
@sonney2k	ok then, so there is no way other than messing around directly in the SGVector
@sonney2k	heiko, so lets keep it like this
@sonney2k	heiko, I just tried serialization_complex_example.py
@sonney2k	it fails in hdf5 and xml
 heiko	sonney2k, yes it complains about missing imprts here
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	it just works
 heiko	sonney2k, ok great :)
-!- in3xes_ [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
@sonney2k	but I think the vector patch needs to be done for xml and hdf5
@sonney2k	too
@sonney2k	json, ascii work
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	well, ok then
 heiko	not too much stuff
@sonney2k	heiko, another question - SGNDArray, SGStringList and SGSparseMatrix also need to be treated like this right (but not yet done - or?)
 heiko	yes, not yet done
 heiko	should I also add this?
@sonney2k	heiko, the types yes, the support can probably wait - or do you know any class that uses these already?
 heiko	sonney2k, I dont know any
 heiko	sonney2k, adding the types is basically the only step for adding support
 heiko	just a few switch cases once one knows what to do
@sonney2k	heiko, I thought you need to change every serializable file format too?
@sonney2k	lets prioritize things
 heiko	yes true, but only minor changes there
@sonney2k	I have to enable make check-exampels tonight
@sonney2k	for that I need hdf5/xml support too
@sonney2k	then all examples run through
 heiko	ok then
@sonney2k	so that first please
 heiko	I will do the xml/hdf5 stuff for vector and matrix
 heiko	are there any serialization examples with the other types?
@sonney2k	then you said there are problems with the migration?
 heiko	well yes, its tricky
@sonney2k	heiko, just save a stringfeature object
@sonney2k	or sparse feature matrix
 heiko	ehm that means, which types have to work? vector, matrix, sparsematrix?
@sonney2k	stringlist
@sonney2k	heiko, but not for make check-examples tonight
@sonney2k	for that we need just vector/matrix
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rbd45c6c / (6 files in 2 dirs): More UI warnings removal - http://bit.ly/rnVzmv
 blackburn	bet if it is <200
 heiko	ok then
 heiko	I will finish this now, have lunch and then continue on migration
@sonney2k	heiko, ok thank you very much for the great job you are doing!
@sonney2k	blackburn, please cheer heiko up too :)

@bettyboo	^_^
 blackburn	heiko: did I said I want to marry you?
@sonney2k	heiko, ^ look at the build failure
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is legal even in germany
 heiko	blackburn, true, so lets go for it :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, not so easy you first have to code with heiko 10 years in a row on shogun *while being married*
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	hehe, unpaid :)
 heiko	sonney2k, the build error is strange
@sonney2k	heiko, I think some include is missing
 heiko	do I have to introduce these enums at another point?
 heiko	i mean if CT_VECTOR is known, how can it be that CT_SGVECTOR is unknown?
@sonney2k	heiko, could be that this is from some early git commit that you did - so it is one that doesn't compile that you checked
 heiko	sonney2k, ok
@sonney2k	heiko, btw in shogun/lib/DataType.h - in the enum
 heiko	sonney2k, thats where i introduced the new type
@sonney2k	you cannot change the meaning of CT_SGMATRIX
@sonney2k	you have to put these CT_SG* types at the end
 heiko	sonney2k, ?
@sonney2k	err  you cannot change the meaning of CT_MATRIX
 heiko	oh
 heiko	is the integer saved somewhere?
@sonney2k	I mean  CT_MATRIX was 2 before or so
@sonney2k	heiko, starting with 1 I suppose
 blackburn	why is it compiles here?
@sonney2k	I wouldn't mind if you do CT_MATRIX=2 etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, revision f059083741272ad277cdd527935fca4b87c919e0 ?
 heiko	sonney2k, i just moved them to the end
@sonney2k	heiko, no I meant you make all these explicit
 heiko	ok, will do
@sonney2k	heiko, this way numbers are fixed & clear
 heiko	guys, I will go for lunch now, mensa is closing soon
 blackburn	ehh how to get revision num
@sonney2k	just make sure you don't change the default
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah cu
 heiko	sonney2k, will be back in the afternoon for all the stuff we just talked about

 serialhex	WOW!!!
 blackburn	sonney2k: seems so
 blackburn	I haven't checked
 blackburn	yeah as you can see
 blackburn	hmm lets make it 100
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko committed the fix
 blackburn	fix about?
@sonney2k	so I will try to get some make check-examples into the buildbot
@sonney2k	serialization
 blackburn	ah, serialization
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	\o/
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about moving kpca under dimreductionpreprocessor?
 blackburn	now it is pretty crazy
 blackburn	we set threshold in constructor (sic!) and then use it as int
@sonney2k	blackburn, makes sense but PCA then too
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	and I would remove alesis' stuff here
 blackburn	with various modes..
 blackburn	I don't sure if I should
@sonney2k	why remove?
@sonney2k	it makes sense to preprocess and say I want 10 components
@sonney2k	or all components with eigenvalues > 0.001
@sonney2k	(these are the 2 modes)
 blackburn	because target dimensionality is useless when there are two modes
 blackburn	not really predictive acting
 blackburn	I don't know
@sonney2k	blackburn, one has to select one of these modes of course
 blackburn	well I don't think preprocessor should think about this thresholding
@sonney2k	I don't mind that you make them extra functions
@sonney2k	such that one has to call them manually like
@sonney2k	compute_pca
@sonney2k	keep_top_n_components
@sonney2k	or so
 blackburn	yeah ok
 blackburn	but this time I have to finish kpca

 serialhex	idk what is to be done about it (if anything) but i'm just letting you know what i've found!
@sonney2k	serialhex, looks like I already tried to fix it:
@sonney2k	#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS 1
@sonney2k	#include <inttypes.h>
@sonney2k	#undef __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
@sonney2k	seems like it didn't help
 serialhex	hmm...
 serialhex	yeah, ruby dosnt like constants with names like that... all constants start with a capital letter... hmm...........
 blackburn	hey guys I've found the strangest function of shogun
 blackburn	here it is
 blackburn	int* cntsrtna(int *sx, int k, int r, int na);
 serialhex	though everything else seems to be running peachy-keen!
 serialhex	do wahh??
 blackburn	I'm stucked what to write in its description ahaha
@sonney2k	blackburn, guessing from the name it sounds like count sort
@sonney2k	na == no idea
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll write that it makes CNTSRTNA
@sonney2k	blackburn, very useful
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	serialhex, I don't actually know why we need inttypes.h
 serialhex	hmm, ok... what's it do?
@sonney2k	serialhex, let me try to compile w/o
 serialhex	oh, and blackburn, when you make yourself famous for all the spiffy docs you can say that i did the russian-english -> english edit :P
 blackburn	hehe
 serialhex	ok cool sonney2k, cause it'd take ~ 20 min to compile here :-/
@sonney2k	serialhex, now I know what it is for
@sonney2k	PRIi32
@sonney2k	^ that is a format specifier
@sonney2k	for int32
 serialhex	...which does?
 serialhex	ahh, i see
@sonney2k	for printf()
 serialhex	oh, ok
@sonney2k	serialhex, still it doesn't make sense that __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS is visible from the swig interfaces

@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know if we can ourselves use --rebase when pulling?
@sonney2k	I mean not that we screw up history?
 blackburn	rebase what to what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, when you do a git push
@sonney2k	and I have some commits already on my local master
@sonney2k	and then do git pull github master
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	really? and there wouldn't be merge?
@sonney2k	then would a git pull github master --rebase work?
 blackburn	ahh it was a question
 blackburn	ahaha
 blackburn	no, I don't know
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you try with some small change?
 blackburn	I try to git pull things just before commiting
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	(I just pushed)
@sonney2k	so when you change some file and do a --rebase
 blackburn	so commit then rebase
@sonney2k	then we will see
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	then push and pray :)
 blackburn	I like the concept of push&prahy
 blackburn	pray
* sonney2k praises $DEITY dancing the ~~~lumbojumboshogunolaaaa~~~~
 blackburn	refusing to pull with rebase: your working tree is not up-to-date

 blackburn	seems the answer is no
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@sonney2k	serialhex, what marks a comment in ruby?
 blackburn	ehh how to call static SGMatrix' method?
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	SGMatrix:xxx
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	got stupidity assault
 serialhex	sorry about the delay sonney2k, a # marks a comment
 serialhex	just like python
@sonney2k	serialhex, ok
@sonney2k	I am just creating documented examples from the undocumented ones
 serialhex	ok cool
@sonney2k	(we have the description in a separate dir and prepend it to each file)
@sonney2k	so I need the comment symbol
@sonney2k	it is really fun to see
@sonney2k	we have '%' '#' '- ' '//'
@sonney2k	but # is the winner now :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, would you mind to move yourhemisphere.py swissroll.py into graphical?
 blackburn	yeah sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you want prepend it with dimreduct_
@sonney2k	them
 blackburn	not really necessary to mark them anyhow
 blackburn	just move it
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok I will do
 blackburn	I thought there will be a millions of examples
 blackburn	but I did two
@sonney2k	blackburn, but you did one for each in the non-graphical dir
 blackburn	yeah but useless
@sonney2k	why useless?
 blackburn	how can one use it? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, copy the example in $DIR, load own data - > run
@sonney2k	easy :)
 blackburn	but no visualization - useless
@sonney2k	but visualization is trivial to add right - everyone can do that
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r33a399d / (5 files in 3 dirs):
 CIA-87	shogun: create documented examples for all supported languages and move the
 CIA-87	shogun: dimreduct examples one dir up - http://bit.ly/rjsFh0
@sonney2k	blackburn, the rebase worked here
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the best way to implement getters with matrices/vectors?
 blackburn	worked?
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	I just did it
 blackburn	I did something wrong
@sonney2k	I did
@sonney2k	git commit -a
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	git pull --rebase github master
 blackburn	I know
@sonney2k	and push
 blackburn	I forgot to specify what to pull
 blackburn	just git pull rebase
@sonney2k	doh
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand the question - inside SGVector you mean?
 blackburn	SGMatrix<float64_t> get_transformation_matrix() const
 blackburn	->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->{
 blackburn	->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->SGMatrix<float64_t> matrix = SGMatrix<float64_t>(m_transformation_matrix);
 blackburn	->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->matrix.do_free = false;
 blackburn	->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->return matrix;
 blackburn	->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->}
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it right way to do that?
 blackburn	or better to make it no-do-free internally?
@sonney2k	yeah - not sure if const will work though
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would make it no-do-free internally
@sonney2k	(I mean you own the object anyways and will do destroy in destructor)
 blackburn	yeah I luv it much more
 blackburn	like heiko
 blackburn	hey gaytoolbox sounds pretty good
 blackburn	shogun gaytoolbox
 blackburn	sonney2k: should kernel be added to m_parameters thing?
 blackburn	in kpca essentially
@sonney2k	blackburn, if the kernel is later needed
 blackburn	when - later?
@sonney2k	think of the preproc is created
@sonney2k	and things added
 blackburn	hmm okay
@sonney2k	then someone wants to save it to disc (can happen at any time)
@sonney2k	and then continue
 blackburn	this time I will just try to get it work
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, the marriage of heiko and you will end the cold work
 blackburn	sonney2k: when cleanup is called?
@sonney2k	cold war
 blackburn	yeah berlin wall will fall
@sonney2k	this can only mean hot times and of course that shogun-toolbox is hot :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, when the user calls it
 blackburn	I would say it is perestroyka now
@sonney2k	anytime so
 blackburn	shogun looks like ussr in 89 hahah
@sonney2k	it is just the end of the world .... of shogun 0.x
 blackburn	btw tomorrow is a 20th anniversary of USSR government take-over
 blackburn	if I born 6 months later I would born in russia :D
 serialhex	lol blackburn!
 blackburn	serialhex: you should hope obama will not do perestroyka :D
 serialhex	perestroyka?  /searches wikipedia...
 blackburn	or perestroika
 blackburn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika
 serialhex	ahhh... i see :P
 blackburn	serialhex: one of + of perestroika - in sonney2k's city there was no wall since 1989
 blackburn	probably that was awful thing :)
 serialhex	cool... i vaguely remember the bringing down of the wall
 blackburn	I didn't born yet in 1989 hehe
 blackburn	whoaa got kpca to compile
 blackburn	but still need to get to work haha
 blackburn	sonney2k: hey but why it doesn't compile if test failed
 blackburn	I can't count warnings haha
-!- f-x [~user@117.192.198.45] has left #shogun ["ERC Version 5.3 (IRC client for Emacs)"]
 serialhex	hey, i keep getting an error when i run classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.rb: "[WARN] Averaged Perceptron algorithm did not converge after 1000 iterations."  does this happen normally?
 serialhex	in the py version?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh how should I fix the issue?
 serialhex	ok, just making sure noting was borked! :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: which?
@sonney2k	blackburn, the linker requires -llapack
@sonney2k	for compiling 1 of the examples
 blackburn	where is it used?
@sonney2k	don't know exactly - I guess dot() for computing kernel
@sonney2k	but that is not the relevant point
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rf5254de / examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile : add -llapack in examples - http://bit.ly/mPOrns
 blackburn	can't it be removed?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what can be removed?
 blackburn	lapack usage in examples
@sonney2k	blackburn, the problem is the example needs to be linked to lapack
 blackburn	yeah but can we modify it to not use lapack
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure we could but we don't know if atlas is installed (we are not using the configure system for examples...)
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 blackburn	ah okay
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r615d2a2 / examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile : add flag LIBS_ADD to add libs in addition to LIBS - http://bit.ly/q9qRqm
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw the problem is only due to using an inline function
@sonney2k	because of that the clbas_ddot is in the header and when linking we need to specify the lib
 blackburn	inline function calls cblas??
 blackburn	I wouldn't make it inline
 shogun-buildbot	build #72 of libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/libshogun/builds/72
@sonney2k	hurray :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, please create a bug report in trac saying that we need to rework Math.h
@sonney2k	and add that we should not have library calls in inline functions
@sonney2k	(otherwise we get hard to track linker deps in C++ extensions)
 blackburn	in one ticket?
@sonney2k	2
@sonney2k	now with check-examples enabled things become much harder
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess some text would not be bad :)
@sonney2k	like why rework and what should be done...
 blackburn	no idea what to rework
@sonney2k	blackburn, split the file up
@sonney2k	blackburn, removing inline is not sufficient btw
@sonney2k	these calls have to be in the .cpp file
 shogun-buildbot	build #63 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/r_static/builds/63  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	hope you satisfied :D
@sonney2k	yeah everything fails finally
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: perestroika
@sonney2k	blackburn, thanks
 blackburn	thanks to gorbachew :D
