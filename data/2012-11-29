 wiking	this is funny
 wiking	n4nd0: i've just found 3 different papers with 3 different author sets on 3 different publication years talking about essentially the same
 n4nd0	nice!
 n4nd0	what about?
 wiking	n4nd0: apparently i've found the solution for this approx
 wiking	indeed
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	what is it?
 wiking	1/\beta \log \sum exp(\beta * f(x,y,w))
 wiking	lim \beta -> \inf
 wiking	will result in
 wiking	max (f(x,y,w))
 wiking	i mean
 wiking	i've missed \delta(y,y_i)
 wiking	but you know what i mena
 wiking	mean
 n4nd0	yeah I kind of get the idea
 n4nd0	I don't know right now if that is the true answer for the limit
 n4nd0	but I believe you :)
 wiking	well in the paper they even have a proof for it
 wiking	so yeah i trust them as well
 wiking	actually i've read it
 wiking	it makes sense
 wiking	so anyhow
 wiking	we could add a softmax thing for so learning
 n4nd0	for the so-svm?
 wiking	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	do you get something similar to a CRF then?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	\beta = 0 CRF
 wiking	\beta = inf SSVM
 n4nd0	interesting
 wiking	and it's super easy to implement this with BMRM
 wiking	n4nd0: Entropy and Margin Maximization for Structured Output Learning
 wiking	check this paper
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	this paper is cool
 wiking	i've just realised that we can do MIL with latent framework :)
 n4nd0	what's MIL?
 wiking	multiple instance learning
 wiking	so you get n set of (x_1,...,x_n)
 wiking	and u know that each set has a label y
 n4nd0	haha it seems that new types of learning don't stop popping out
 wiking	but you don't know the exact label for each x_i
 wiking	and of course it could be that you get a set of x-es
 wiking	with label y_i
 wiking	but that some of those x-es are not really y_i
 wiking	We construct a one-dimensional synthetic dataset which illustrates the de- ficiencies of the MI-SVM. A positive bag consists of p positive instances and 50 - p negative (0 < p <= 50), a negative bag contains 50 negative instances. The individual instances are hard to classify: the positive instances are Gaussian dis- tributed with mean 0.6 whereas the negative instances are Gaussian distributed with mean 0, the variance for both classes is 1.
 wiking	this is what they do
 n4nd0	aham it sounds cool
 n4nd0	a way to get rid of data outliers maybe
 wiking	let see if i can do this
 wiking	should be easy to generate this dataset :)
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	time to sleep
 n4nd0	good night!

 sonne|work	previous?
 sonne|work	what?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	sonne|work: i mean in SGSparseVector you declare SGSparseVectorEntry as struct
 wiking	but then for example in File.h you refere to it as a class

 wiking	voila
 sonne|work	wiking: does it build now?
 wiking	it was building before
 wiking	just flooding with warnings about this
 wiking	yeah better thnx
 sonne|work	k

 wiking	ok i thnk i have an awesome example coming up for shogun
 wiking	it's even graphical
 wiking	so you can post it to the webpage
 blackburn	does it contain tits?
 wiking	blackburn: :D
 wiking	sonne|work: mmm i think there's a way to connect buildbots as well to the pull request hook in github
 sonne|work	wiking: ?
 wiking	sonne|work: well i've just seen this
 sonne|work	it is
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/181
 sonne|work	ahh
 sonne|work	ok so you mean even before commit
 wiking	sonne|work: and that link there for good to merge
 wiking	is not coming from travis
 wiking	it's from a buildbot
 wiking	sonne|work: indeed, so it's like travis
 wiking	sonne|work: ah ok i think i know how it works
 wiking	sonne|work: you need to define in service hooks
 wiking	a webhook url
 wiking	as it says
 wiking	"We'll hit these URLs with POST requests when you push to us, passing along information about the push. More information can be found in the Post-Receive Guide."
 wiking	sonne|work: and it seems there should be a module for this to be handled in buildbot

@sonney2k	wiking, I finally understand why the buildbot is failing on cygwin
@sonney2k	we use a reserved word
@sonney2k	__from! nothing should be __'t
 wiking	??
 wiking	lolface
 wiking	yeah that's uricamic's  coe

-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 1f7a6cc Soeren Sonnenburg: fixup cygwin build -> never use __reserved __keywords!
 wiking	hahah i bet blackburn woulld love this nameing: MILFeature ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, no blackburn introduced some convenience constructor +       TMultipleCPinfo(uint32_t __from, uint32_t _N) : _from(__from), N(_N) {  }
@sonney2k	and that kills it
@sonney2k	took me ages to find out :/
 wiking	:(
 wiking	yeah i would have never guessed that __* is reserved in cygwin's gcc
@sonney2k	wiking, btw I wrote some example for dynarray and likely found the issue
 wiking	sonney2k: great!
@sonney2k	we memset(0) the newly allocated memory
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i've seen that
@sonney2k	that doesn't work with objects of course
 wiking	but it's only memsetting the new area no?
@sonney2k	kaboom
@sonney2k	sure but that would be and SGVector sitting on that new area
@sonney2k	memset it
@sonney2k	and then at some point it gets destructed
@sonney2k	I can easily fix this - only question is if sth relies on the memset 0 behavior
 wiking	who's using DynArray?
@sonney2k	lots of stuff
 wiking	ah well then yeah good luck with debugging it out
 wiking	:(
 wiking	btw something like this would be fun as well
 wiking	http://lxr.linux.no/+trees
@sonney2k	good thing with the new malloc templates
@sonney2k	is though that one can fix it
@sonney2k	wiking, I actually think that this might not be a problem at all - let me commit and see what fails
 wiking	heheh glhf
 wiking	;)
 wiking	wtf: TypeError: not a numpy vector of appropriate type
