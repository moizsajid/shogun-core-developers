 thoralf	Hey.
@wiking	thoralf: yo
 thoralf	Yo Vik
@wiking	thoralf: i second that idea that we should have a thin object
@wiking	that would be the parent of objects like io and features
@wiking	learning from the story of structured labels
 thoralf	Cool.
 thoralf	SGThinObject and SGFatObject :)
@wiking	yeah something like that
@wiking	of course what we could do is that
 thoralf	I'm not sure how far we can get with as less effort es possible, because everything is so tight coupled...
@wiking	SGThinObject and then SGObject : SGThinObject
@wiking	and then some of the stuff are being directly inherited from SGThinObject
@wiking	the others remain...
 thoralf	Currently we have SGRefObject, which is *very* thin. ;)
-!- khalednasr [~k.nasr92@41.69.154.97] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	Only RefCounting, nothing else.  And getName() as well IIRC.
 thoralf	But what would be the use of this object?  It cannot be compared like other objects, it doesn't have serialization and (most important) if used in other fat objects, the fat object cannot be serialized completely, because it's recursive.

 thoralf	wiking: Still there?  The problem with serialization (for example) is, that an serializable object forces serialization of every contained object.
