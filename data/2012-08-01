 blackburn	wiking: ping
 blackburn	n4nd0: I want to make streaming stuff optional
 blackburn	what do you think?
 n4nd0	sorry I didn't hear the bell
 n4nd0	but I read your message
 n4nd0	blackburn: it makes sense to make it optional if it is not normally used
 n4nd0	but what will we will if it is optional?
 n4nd0	-> problems with people building shogun and wanting to use it (they won't find it by default)
 n4nd0	-> compilation time reduced??
 blackburn	yeah significantly
 n4nd0	do you think so?
 CIA-18	shogun: Christian Widmer master * rb1765dd / src/configure : fixed eigen3 detection for the case where includes are located in non-standard directory, e.g. ./configure --includes=/home/user/include/eigen3/ - http://git.io/8rihug
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rd866352 / src/configure : Merge pull request #682 from cwidmer/master - http://git.io/oNDHNA
 blackburn	problem is that it is not used at all
 blackburn	I bet just nobody uses it
 blackburn	and it is not really supported I am afraid
 n4nd0	didn't pluskid ask about it some time ago during his GSoC?
 n4nd0	something related to VW
 blackburn	well he introduced one algo which is online actually
 n4nd0	that would go to the optinal part too?
 blackburn	yeah probably
 n4nd0	apart from the compilation time, something else?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	nothing :D
 n4nd0	mmm ok
 blackburn	probably wrong idea :D
 n4nd0	I think it is a good idea
 n4nd0	but let say it this way
 n4nd0	why instead of making optional to use them
 n4nd0	making optional NOT to build shogun with it?
 blackburn	heh good
 n4nd0	it would be something like the disable-optimizations we normally use
 blackburn	we should find a way to separate interface file

 Cheng	pluskid: Hi, sorry was just chatting with someone in the corridor.
 pluskid	Cheng: then hi again :)
 pluskid	so shall we talk about our next plan?
 Cheng	pluskid: So, you've finished with RelaxTree?
 pluskid	I'm currently working on the feedback of my PR to get it merged
 Cheng	Good!
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:fd90:1089:27:b16] has joined #shogun
 Cheng	What next? fast label tree, hinge boost, adaptive codes, benchmarks.
 pluskid	maybe I will try to port some of my survey to the shogun-tutorial doc
 Cheng	That's what I have on my list.
 Cheng	Is this still correct?
 pluskid	yeah
 pluskid	the next might be hingeboost or fast label tree
 Cheng	Yes, porting your survey to the tutorial is a great idea.
 pluskid	considering we already have two trees, I might prefer hingeboost, but haven't decided
 Cheng	Yes, hinge boost would give a different class of algorithm.
 pluskid	at the same time, if we could get some help (e.g. reference code) from Gun for adaptive codes, that could also be taken with higher priority
 Cheng	It is worth emailing him to ask, because Gunnar is the kind of person who keeps everything.
 Cheng	Send him an email and copy me.
 pluskid	Cheng: OK, I'll do that later today
 Cheng	To benchmark or not to benchmark, that is the question.
 pluskid	Personally I support this idea
 pluskid	but I wish to postpone it
 pluskid	because I'm not very sure that reasonable results can be obtained within some fixed period of time
 Cheng	Postpone in the sense "not in GSoC"?
 pluskid	Cheng: no, I mean at the tail of GSoC
 pluskid	btw, I'm sort of forgetting the end date of GSoC
 pluskid	I'll check that now
 Cheng	Ok, but I was thinking that perhaps you may not have enough time if you don't drop one of the three remaining algorithms.
 pluskid	Cheng: yeah, you are right, I can't implement all of them
 pluskid	I spent a bit longer than expected to implement Relaxed Tree
 pluskid	and now I also think shogun-tutorial is important
 pluskid	Ah, end date is Aug. 20
 pluskid	pencil down
 pluskid	so I'm afraid there's only time for one more algorithm
 Cheng	I think you already have enough algorithms.
 pluskid	besides shogun-tutorial and benchmark
 Cheng	So if you do not implement any more, it would also be ok for me.
 Cheng	I think it is between Gunnar and hingeboost
 pluskid	Cheng: OK
 Cheng	if you want to implement one more...
 pluskid	anyway, I'll ask Gunnar for some suggestions first
 Cheng	Do you agree to forget about fast label tree?
 pluskid	yeah, seems we have to
 pluskid	and we have enough trees
 Cheng	When I suggested the benchmark, I was thinking mostly about its tutorial value.
 pluskid	Cheng: yes, too many algorithms also making users confusing
 Cheng	I don't think it is that important (for you) to do a proper benchmarking.
 pluskid	Cheng: you mean just some guidelines or examples to show to users?
 Cheng	First definitely example code.
 Cheng	But also some sort of way to decide what to use.
 pluskid	hmm, I agree with you
 pluskid	actually, I think many of the algorithms are not directly comparable, because they have their different characteristics and application domains
 Cheng	Here's a crazily super dream: http://plato.asu.edu/guide.html
 Cheng	I know we cannot achieve that kind of thing, but this would be something very useful everytime there are multiple algorithms for related problems.
 pluskid	wow, that site is cool
 Cheng	That's why perhaps "benchmark" was not the right word.
 pluskid	OK, I see now
 pluskid	btw: I also have an issue with benchmarking, it seems unrealistic to run (and tuning, cross-validation, etc.) MNIST on my laptop
 Cheng	How about USPS?
 Cheng	I think it is a smaller dataset.
 pluskid	I have access to a server to my previous school, but my access permission is too low to install softwares (like shogun)
 Cheng	Wait... what do you think should go into the benchmark?
 pluskid	so maybe we might use some smaller dataset
 pluskid	Cheng: I guess at least we should try hard to make the results best?
 pluskid	like parameter tuning
 Cheng	USPS digits is smaller, e.g. available at: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/data/
 pluskid	but that's also contradicting, because unlike experiments in a paper, where the performance is the most cared thing, I think we should also care about the running time here
 Cheng	I think a proper benchmarking will take way too long.
 Cheng	Definitely more than 20 days.
 pluskid	Cheng: yeah
 pluskid	Cheng: so do you have any suggestions here?
 pluskid	Cheng: what should we focus on in this "benchmark" and what can be relaxed?
 Cheng	pluskid: My idea is to write some example code for each algorithm.
 Cheng	The focus is on the tutorial nature.
 Cheng	Have two or three datasets, such that each algorithm can work on one or two of them.
 pluskid	Cheng: OK, so we polish and tweak the existing libshogun or python_modular example code, add comments and explanations, right?
 Cheng	It is ok to have a table with empty entries.
 pluskid	and we add suggestions for algorithm selection
 pluskid	OK, I think I'm sort of clear now
 Cheng	But the suggestions for algorithm selection, and also the table comparing runtime and accuracy should be in the tutorial (or somewhere similar).
 Cheng	I'm not 100% sure that these more complex examples should go into python_modular examples directory.
 Cheng	That's why I gave them a new name "benchmark".
 pluskid	Cheng: OK, I see
 Cheng	The reason for the python_modular examples is so that people can just hack them to use for their own purposes.
 Cheng	So, they need to run in a few seconds.
 Cheng	See my dilemma?
 pluskid	I think other people might also need example code in their section in shogun-tutorial, so we might end up with a new directory or a new shogun-foobar repo
 pluskid	Cheng: yeah, I see
 Cheng	I think right now, just do everything under the tutorial.
 pluskid	hmm, OK
 Cheng	So, have some more complex examples (e.g. with small amount of parameter tuning) in the tutorial.
 Cheng	I'm not also so clear about exactly what kind of tutorial will appear, but it would be nice to have some theory and some code too.
 pluskid	yeah, and some explaination of how the algorithm works
 Cheng	Like Marsland's book.
 pluskid	they already have some content there, but most are still empty
 Cheng	http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/smarsland/MLbook.html
 Cheng	As part if the multiclass chapter, it would be nice to have the "benchmark"
 Cheng	:-)
 pluskid	this book looks cool
 pluskid	I think my friends will like it when I recommend this to them :)

 Cheng	pluskid: So how about (1) tutorial, (2) one more algorithm, for the next 3 weeks?
 pluskid	difficulty with this kind of things is maintaining the code to be compatable with the latest code
 pluskid	Cheng: yeah, I think this is reasonable
 pluskid	Cheng: do you have priority over tutorial by putting (1) and (2)?
 Cheng	Not really. You can do whichever order you like.
 pluskid	Cheng: OK
 Cheng	Um... I should know this, but do you have to write a report or something for GSoC?
 pluskid	Cheng: I'm not sure, I guess no
 Cheng	One less thing to do. :-)
 pluskid	even if there's one, that should not be very difficult I think
 pluskid	something like the mid-term survey
 Cheng	So, you decide between hingeboost and polychotomies?
 Cheng	Doesn't have to be now.
 pluskid	not yet, I'll make the decision after feedback from Prof. Gunnar
 pluskid	anyway, I'll fix the code reviews of my PR first, Soeren gave me a lot of suggestions :D
 Cheng	I feel kind of guilty being a mentor who cannot really program in shogun anymore...
 Cheng	As long as you have some people to help you have fun, I think it is ok...
 pluskid	Cheng: haha, do mentors at shogun typically programming with the students?
 Cheng	Soeren does.
 pluskid	Cheng: Soeren have to be there, or else all of us will fill shogun with STL stuffs immediately haha :p
 Cheng	But mostly, the mentors are experts in the method, and not in C__
 pluskid	Cheng: and I think your suggestions are always very helpful for me
 Cheng	Well, if you can figure out how to swig STL to all target languages, then I'm sure it will not be a big problem.
 pluskid	haha, I'll not take that risk of nightmares of maintaining so many languages interfaces
 pluskid	Cheng: So I'm clear of all my questions, thank you very much for your time. Do you have any other stuffs that are to be discussed?
 Cheng	pluskid: I think we discussed everything.
 pluskid	cool!
 Cheng	pluskid: I'll pull the tutorial to have a look next week.
 Cheng	pluskid: if that is ok with you.
 Cheng	pluskid: or whenever you are ready, and tell me to.
 pluskid	Cheng: not sure there will be enough of multiclass stuff there by then
 pluskid	Cheng: OK, I'll write you an email when I have something there :)
 Cheng	pluskid: then some later time then...
 pluskid	ok
 n4nd0	pluskid: hi pluskid, do you how can I push a .mat to the repo?
 n4nd0	pluskid: I believe I have to do it pushing to the shogun-data repo and doing a PR
 n4nd0	I am not sure though
 pluskid	n4nd0: I think you have to fork shogun-data in github to make a PR
 pluskid	but I haven't tried that
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I think I have actually done it once
 n4nd0	haha I don't remember
 pluskid	I put some small toy dataset, but blackburn helped me to do that, so I didn't make a PR
 pluskid	if your .mat is not big, maybe blackburn can help you to put there directly
 pluskid	cloning a whole shogun-data is really slow for my internet connection
 n4nd0	I already have it here to tell the truth
 n4nd0	shogun-data
 pluskid	hmm, then that might be easier :)
 n4nd0	yeah, I will just add my file there
 n4nd0	thank you!
 pluskid	you are welcome :)
 n4nd0	pluskid: when are you going to USA btw?
 pluskid	n4nd0: fly is on Aug. 23
 n4nd0	pluskid: not that much left!
 pluskid	right after GSoC pencil down time
 n4nd0	it must be really exciting for you, right?
 pluskid	yeah, to tell the truth, I can't wait any more  :p
 pluskid	first time to be abroad
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	and to start your phd!
 n4nd0	awesome
 pluskid	n4nd0: btw, did you watch the movie "the PhD movie"?
 pluskid	movie for the "Piled Higher and Deeper" comics
 n4nd0	n4nd0: no I haven't
 n4nd0	is it good?
 pluskid	http://www.phdmovie.com/
 pluskid	it's interesting
 pluskid	reflect many of the "real life" of graduate students I think
 pluskid	though a bit exaggerating :D
 n4nd0	haha ok
 pluskid	though I like their comics better than their movie :D
 n4nd0	pluskid: where can I find the comics?
 n4nd0	I never heard about them
 pluskid	n4nd0: http://www.phdcomics.com/
 pluskid	http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive_list.php
 n4nd0	thank you
 pluskid	ur wel~

 n4nd0	hey blackburn

 n4nd0	I've just seen your comment
 n4nd0	but I must be already half-sleep :P
 n4nd0	what do you mean with it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I just posted it
 blackburn	which one?
 n4nd0	will it come back?
 blackburn	you commented out ifdef
 n4nd0	oh fuck
 blackburn	and in mosek.cpp too
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	it is because sometimes, I don't know why even if I put manually the USE_MOSEK in .config, shogun was not built for those parts
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw I bet it is a good experience for ya to play with mosek
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it has been useful I think
 blackburn	so mosek detection is bad?
 n4nd0	mmm not really
 n4nd0	it was something with the .config and the ifdefs
 n4nd0	that even if I had in my .config (manually introduced) -DUSE_MOSEK
 n4nd0	those parts were not compiled
 n4nd0	I ignore why
 blackburn	ohh your PR is terribly big
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I am sorry :(
 n4nd0	about the USE_MOSEK thing
 n4nd0	I think I should modify and amend to a commit
 n4nd0	otherwise, I am afraid that the buildbot will fail
 n4nd0	because it doesn't have mosek installed
 blackburn	feel free :)
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I will have to amend previous commits
 blackburn	ehmm do we have mosek detection at all?
 n4nd0	I did it some days ago
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	Soeren told me not worry about it
 blackburn	well I'll do that then
 n4nd0	that we didn't plan to include it
 blackburn	why?
 n4nd0	I don't know
 blackburn	so you wanted *not to have mosek in configure*?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	I had mosek in the configure
 n4nd0	but it is not autodetected
 n4nd0	for example
 n4nd0	I run ./configure --disable.... blah blah blah
 blackburn	right
 n4nd0	and later I modify the file .config created
 n4nd0	adding in INCLUDES -DUSE_MOSEK
 n4nd0	the corresponding compilation flags
