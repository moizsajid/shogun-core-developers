 sonne|work	van51: how is it going?
 van51	hey
 van51	sonne|work: I tried to make the test you said -- approximate the kernel matrix by increasing the dimension of the random feats
 van51	sonne|work: on some toy data
 van51	sonne|work: but it didn't approximate well some entries and neither did the feats by using the preprocessor
 sonne|work	van51: well plot the matrix!
 sonne|work	van51: from python it would just be
 sonne|work	from pylab import *
 sonne|work	imshow(matrix)
 sonne|work	and matrix you could get from kernel.get_kernel_matrix()
 sonne|work	or poly kernel on your dotfeatures
 sonne|work	with degree=1 as usual
 sonne|work	no normalization

@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
@wiking	thoralf: you know that if you add -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON with cmake then you can run ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck
@wiking	thoralf: which will actually run valgrind on all the unit tests
@wiking	i mean all the tests
@wiking	including unit tests
 thoralf	wiking: I did not.  Thanks for telling.
@wiking	nw
@wiking	of course the problem there will be that valgrind will be ran on the whole unit tests
@wiking	and not per unit test 'module'
@wiking	the idea is that we'll enable this on the buildbots
@wiking	but the last time i've tried
@wiking	when openmp was enabled
@wiking	one of tapkee modules went to infinite loop
@wiking	and valgrind never returned :(
 thoralf	wiking: I wrote a small test to identify errors automatically.  But I'll check above cmake options, since its better fitting my daily routine. ;)
@wiking	thoralf: we might just enable those ctest targets by default ... and not only with -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, that would be great.
 thoralf	wiking: Are the DASHBOARD_REPORTS automatically posted somewhere online?  I saw something with maeth.com in CTestConfig.cmake
@wiking	thoralf: no not realy... u have to do ctest -T Submit
@wiking	thoralf: but yeah the idea was that if anybody starts having problems with build/cmake then instead of copy pasting one could just simply post the whole cmake+build+test output to cdash (maeth.com)
 thoralf	wiking: Cool idea.

@wiking	sonne|work: ok so one thing about class_list.cpp.py
@wiking	sonne|work: blacklisting is a bit awkward now

 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hey there
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I have a class organization question
 lisitsyn	yes sure
 lisitsyn	what's it?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: so Andreas brought up that it would be good to have setters for the number of iterations, and tolerance (the params of the AJD method) from the ICA class and I agree
 pickle27	What I am debating is whether these setters go in the ICA base class or in each derived class
 pickle27	I think most ICA algs will have these params but some might not
 sonne|work	van51: can you put the images somewhere
 pickle27	so the choice is to have them in each derived class where they are necessary or have them in the base class and do some sort of "not impl flag" in derived classes which don'
 lisitsyn	pickle27: it seems to me that it is ok to have them even if they are not sued
 pickle27	use them
 pickle27	okay
 lisitsyn	pickle27: you can redefine them in the classes they are not used
 van51	sonne|work: atm all I have are text outputs of some matrices
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay that makes sense
 van51	sonne|work: bc I am trying to find why this avalanche effect takes place
 van51	sonne|work: do you want me to plot anyway?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I thought something like that was the best solution but thought I'd double check
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah sure
 pickle27	also lisitsyn did you see the base class PR? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1474 Im just wondering what they meant with the comments
 pickle27	is it the third argument that should drop the m_?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: no
 lisitsyn	pickle27: the third argument is a textual description
 lisitsyn	like "The matrix that contains some stuff"
 sonne|work	van51: or give me the ascii's :)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: oh so I should give it a proper description
 lisitsyn	pickle27: the second argument is ok
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah would be better
@wiking	ok
@wiking	update the notes for yesterday's meeting
 lisitsyn	pickle27: all the rest is ok
 lisitsyn	pickle27: it is just some note to remember that the name (the second argument) should be w/o m_
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay! I was thinking I might beef up the documentation a bit when I add these setters. its also less annoying to do now that there is a base class, less duplication

@wiking	no :(

@wiking	lol https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Future-of-Shogun-Brainstorming
@wiking	this is like 80% done
 pickle27	lisitsyn: wiking for my future involvement with shogun I quite like doing matlab -> shogun or python -> shogun ports
 pickle27	fyi
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ok so mentor me
 lisitsyn	I need realtime bgs
@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
 pickle27	so Im happy to help with such thinga
 pickle27	ah right wasn;t sure you were done with the question
@wiking	bgs?
 lisitsyn	wiking: background subtraction
 pickle27	lisitsyn: video data then? how big is the data? is it indoor or outdoor?
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: gpu it
@wiking	;)
 pickle27	as in resolution of the images
 lisitsyn	pickle27: let me send you a file
 pickle27	okay
 lisitsyn	https://twitter.com/CVsIntellect/status/372706530178502657 haha see I am kicking asses
@wiking	thoralf: btw that was an interesting one that the valgrind was not finding any leaking with Release :(
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, I was wondering, too.
 thoralf	wiking: But I don't know enough about valgrind&co to tell what caused it.
 thoralf	wiking: btw. was no leak but an invalid read/write
 lisitsyn	pickle27: please see your inbox
 pickle27	got it
@wiking	thoralf: make -j install # install required for "make test"
@wiking	thoralf: not true
 thoralf	wiking: But the (python?) examples will fail without make install
 van51	sonne|work: it was because of the preprocessor.. it also changes the feature matrix of the CDotFeatures object it is working on
@wiking	thoralf: mmm indeed but we should drop that one
@wiking	thoralf: because we are switching to from modshogun import ...
@wiking	afaik foor shogun 3.0 we should already remove that
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but we'll see
 sonne|work	van51: errm ?
 thoralf	wiking: It's just what I (painfully ;)) learned so far and wanted to share. ;)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay so indoor scene fairly controlled decently high res video
 sonne|work	van51: what preprocessor?
 thoralf	wiking: You can always change it and/or correct me if I'm wrong.
 van51	sonne|work: I was testing both the random fourier dot features and the random fourier preprocessor on the same target dimensions
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah all the videos are rather the same
 pickle27	lisitsyn: If you can I would use OpenCV probably the gpu bgs module
 lisitsyn	pickle27: no gpu unfortunately
 sonne|work	wiking: any news on the workshop video upload?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I tried MOG and MOG2 and GMG
 pickle27	lisitsyn: they didn't work well enough or were too slow?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: the main problem is that the color of the vehicle is quite similar to the color of the floor
 lisitsyn	so it slowly disappears :D
 lisitsyn	from the bg/fg mask
 pickle27	lisitsyn: ah right, the learning params are weird in OpenCVs implementation
 lisitsyn	pickle27: so I wonder if you know anything possible to be 25fps but based on some context around pixel
 lisitsyn	may be texture based or so
 sonne|work	van51: I still don't get it - so you had the preprocessor attached on the random fourier dot features?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I don't think you need something complicated you just need something you have more control over
 lisitsyn	pickle27: do you think GM model would be ok anyway?
 van51	sonne|work: I think this will explain it better : https://gist.github.com/van51/6366231 :)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: RPCA is not near to realtime right?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: specifically an alg that features an update mask so you don't learn from what you just classified as foreground
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh good idea I haven't though about that
 pickle27	lisitsyn: RPCA is real time after training, but training a model takes forever
 pickle27	I'd also recommend a saliency filter for post processing
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I don't know about these filters
 lisitsyn	what is it?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: its really basic, you run your bgs alg with a high and low thresh
 lisitsyn	ahh and how do I combine them?
 pickle27	then you do a grass fire type approach where you scan the high thresh map and look for a froegorund pixel and then fan out but then the pixels only need to beet the low thresh
 pickle27	so that all forground was connected to a high thresh pixel at some point
 sonne|work	van51: no :D
 pickle27	it can let you have a lower thresh and get the obj outline better
 sonne|work	van51: which line is the culprit?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: Im sending a paper
 van51	sonne|work: 63. it also set the dense_feats matrix
 lisitsyn	pickle27: thanks!
 van51	sonne|work: I thought it was just returning it
 pickle27	lisitsyn: its a survey paper but he does a really nice job describing the common post processing stuff
 lisitsyn	pickle27: how would you filter out some small blobs?
 pickle27	ahh an area filter, I'd use opencv's connected components
 pickle27	lisitsyn: Parks releases a lib of some basic techniques which I updated to modern opencv
 pickle27	https://github.com/pickle27/libBGS?source=c
 sonne|work	van51: but you never touch dense_feats afterwards?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: cool
 pickle27	the median alg might be a good one to try, super simple but should work for your indoor scene
 van51	sonne|work: I do in the next loop
 sonne|work	ahh
 sonne|work	missed the loop
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I also have some have done code for the post processing that I'll send you
 sonne|work	van51: btw the kernel->set_normalizer should be refactored to be void set_normalizer()
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh great :)
 van51	sonne|work: if it cannot fail, sure :)
 sonne|work	van51: well if it fails -> SG_ERROR
 pickle27	lisitsyn: the last thing I would recommend
 lisitsyn	pickle27: the main problem I see now is that sometimes some flares are here
 lisitsyn	and the floor is made of metal
 sonne|work	this bool return stuff is rather useless
 pickle27	lisitsyn: right
 van51	sonne|work: new results : https://gist.github.com/van51/6366217
 pickle27	I think this will help with that
 pickle27	so
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I don't know how to handle that yet
 lisitsyn	ah okay tell me
 lisitsyn	;)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: the thing with BGS is that when it comes to your application you probably want to have higher recall and lower precision to make sure you don't miss anything
 pickle27	like you are probably sending the foreground object to a tracker or something right?
 sonne|work	van51: please compute max(abs(ref_matrix-random_ff))
 lisitsyn	pickle27: no I need to detect it
 lisitsyn	pickle27: it is just a first step for me
 pickle27	lisitsyn: thats what I mean its a first step
 sonne|work	van51: and please use other data :)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ahh yeah okay
 sonne|work	van51: this kernel is basically a 0 everywhere and 1 on the diagonal
 pickle27	lisitsyn: so you really only need your BGS alg to get a good guess
 pickle27	I'd recommend making another system on top using machine learning to find the mistakes from BGS
 pickle27	some code is being linked in a sec
 sonne|work	van51: or make the width of the kernel to be about num_dim

@iglesiasg	hello hello
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah I need some detection on top of that
 lisitsyn	no idea what kind of though
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I'd use something similar to what they use here: https://github.com/MasteringOpenCV/code/tree/master/Chapter5_NumberPlateRecognition
@iglesiasg	wiking, more than 10 mails from Viktor Gal in my mailbox! :D
 pickle27	They run a segmentation (for you this is BGS) and then use a SVM to take all the candidates and decide which are actually licence plates
 pickle27	I used something like this here as well:
 van51	sonne|work: ok, will do
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah that sounds good
 sonne|work	van51: but it looks OKish - nice work!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I think some HOG would detect the vehicle
 pickle27	here I wrote on my blog about this
 pickle27	http://kevinhughes.ca/2013/02/21/frc-ultimate-ascent-vision-system/
 pickle27	what I did was still pretty simple but I think thats the framework you need
 sonne|work	gsomix: did you fix the locale bug?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: also you might find some good src code for newer algs on this site
 pickle27	http://changedetection.net/
 pickle27	BSG wise
 lisitsyn	pickle27: quite cool!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: thanks a lot
 pickle27	lisitsyn: np! I hope that helps
 lisitsyn	pickle27: actually the task is to determine whether the vehicle carries something
 pickle27	lisitsyn: ahh cool
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I have no idea whether svm can handle that
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah me either
 pickle27	lisitsyn: are you going to try and use Shogun at all? I've been wanting to do something combining opencv and shogun for a while

 pickle27	lisitsyn: opencv has adaboost we could probably prot over

@iglesiasg	pickle27, I think viktor has done some stuff with Shogun and opencv together

@iglesiasg	votjakovr, just tried compiling with -g and still no error :D
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: hi! hmm...
@iglesiasg	votjakovr, it is just for fun, not something really important though hehe
@iglesiasg	just curious about it
@iglesiasg	but anyway yes, what you said makes complete sense
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: yeah, but i still have no idea, why valgrind doesn't report an error in your example
@iglesiasg	votjakovr, yep, me neither
@iglesiasg	votjakovr, let me try if it happens when using SGVector
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I think I forgot checking in that PR the thing of m_ in SG_ADD
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, yeah sorry, in hushell's pull request

@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yep got it
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, thank you
@HeikoS	thanks for reviewing all that stuff btw :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: what do you think about all students reviewing each others notebooks for gsoc?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, very good idea
@HeikoS	you suggested that right?
@HeikoS	takes some time though
@iglesiasg	I don't know
@iglesiasg	maybe I did hehe
@iglesiasg	but one reading all the others is quite a bit
@iglesiasg	I would suggest just doing it randomly
@iglesiasg	I mean, if someone wants to read all of them, that's fine
@iglesiasg	but maybe each student could be assigned to another project and be expected to comment a little bit about it
@HeikoS	when do you think is a good idea to have the thing ready so that there is some time to review?
@HeikoS	also would be good if students read each others class documentations
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: should we maybe ask every student for a list of class (documentations) that the others should read and suggest improvements
@HeikoS	ok what about everyone does two?
@HeikoS	who is writing class based code?
@HeikoS	or who is not?
@HeikoS	foulwall is not right?
@HeikoS	but still his stuff should be documented
@HeikoS	maybe if we generate random paris of students to review each others dox?
@HeikoS	do you think people will like that?
@HeikoS	will probably be useful
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah its not about reviewing code
@HeikoS	more about reeviewing the docs so that people understand
@HeikoS	sometimes one has a very narrow view after working on it for months
@iglesiasg	in particular foulwall I think it is pretty important his stuff is well documented
@HeikoS	yewp
@iglesiasg	so that it is easy in the future for other people extend with more demos
@HeikoS	ok so then I will ask everyone to have things done one 1-2 weeks before deadlines
@HeikoS	so that that last two weeks can be spent on fine-tuning and reviewing own and other's docs
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, that sounds good to me
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: i've figured, if we create an array in heap, then valgrind reports about invalid memory read
@iglesiasg	votjakovr, aham that would make sense!
 lisitsyn	http://www.secretgeek.net/ex_ms.asp
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, haha man that's hilarious

 van51	sonne|osx: it did have a bug
@HeikoS	votjakovr: we could add a slag to the parameters, whether they are in std space or log-space

 van51	sonne|osx: yea I will update it soon and let you know :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: or we just say: kernel parameters are in std-space, all others in GP in log-space (thats correct right)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so then, you could just do the transformation by hand, i.e. translate log-parameters back to normal ones for kernels

@HeikoS	votjakovr: cool
@HeikoS	votjakovr: also try to figure out a way to initialise the parameters with values

@HeikoS	not some specified by a tree
 votjakovr	HeikoS: absolutely agree!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and this brings us to the biggest problem I currently have with this
@HeikoS	votjakovr: the way users have to specify the parameter trees
@HeikoS	votjakovr: this is not really necessary. I usually want to optimize all parameters right?

 pickle27	iglesiasg: okay well either way I'll wait til friday
@iglesiasg	pickle27, all right
@iglesiasg	pickle27, he told me he is very busy these days so probably it is a good idea to ask him about it in the meeting

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Viktor Gal :develop * 7711764 / src/shogun/base/class_list.cpp.py: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/7711764498e59a07d740c27c90b2ffac9782feea
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add HAVE_COLPACK to config_tests in class_list.cpp.py
@wiking	there
@wiking	that should fix lambday's problem... but he'll have to revert the last changes i requested :(
@HeikoS	wiking: merge his PR when as soon as you dare ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: he will get over it
@wiking	HeikoS: i'll wait for the reversion ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: we can do that thing properly ater on
@HeikoS	wiking: now I just need the sampler
@HeikoS	wiking: excited, because my PBS swarm works
@HeikoS	all I need is this log-determinant
@wiking	votjakovr: didn't u wanted NLOPT on travis?
@HeikoS	wiking: thats votjakovr
@HeikoS	he needs it
@HeikoS	so yes
@wiking	HeikoS: awesooome where's the python script
@wiking	HeikoS: ok let me generate the shiatz
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053046168.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@wiking	votjakovr: nlopt 2.3 is good enough?
@HeikoS	wiking: its quite some code
@HeikoS	wiking: I will put into a git soon
@HeikoS	just very raw prototype
@HeikoS	I dont think we should extend it
@HeikoS	rather use it as a basis to develop this stuff in shogun
 lambday	wiking: hi just saw your comment
@wiking	lambday: sorry about that
 lambday	wiking: lol no no not a problem
 lambday	the only problem is, I never reverted to an older commit before..
 lambday	:-/
@wiking	is there any special stuff from nlopt we need?
 lambday	with git
 lambday	I am figuring it out
@wiking	lambday: just do the changes again
@wiking	and commit it
@wiking	reversion is a bitch
 hushell	HeikoS: Hi, may I ask a short question?
@HeikoS	hushell: shoot
@wiking	and i'm afraid your branch is going to die
@wiking	in a way
 lambday	wiking: that's easier but there was something for git..
@wiking	so rather just redo and recommit
 hushell	HeikoS: why should we init every member in the init()?
 lambday	okay making these changes is easier actually - gotta change 5 lines
 hushell	HeikoS: I mean for different constructor, some of them may be initialized differently
@HeikoS	hushell: because everyone (including me and you) keep on forgetting to initialized members in classes and that causes memory errors which I spent many hours fixing recently
@HeikoS	hushell: you still can do that, just make sure you call init before
@HeikoS	then *everything* is initialised

 shogun-buildbot	<votjakovr@gmail.com>
@HeikoS	and then you can override
 hushell	HeikoS: I see, for safty reason
@HeikoS	but doing it when registering is good practice to guaranty that they are registered
@HeikoS	hushell: in the near future, forgetting it will break unit-tests but not yet
 hushell	HeikoS: SGVector is not necessarily being initialized, isn't it?
@HeikoS	hushell: its just a good practice thing
 votjakovr	wiking: yeah, nlopt 2.3 is ok
@HeikoS	hushell: SGVector does not need to be initialised since its on the stack and the default constructor does this for you
@HeikoS	hushell: only basic types and CSGObject
 gsomix	wiking, hey. it seems bug #1401 #1402 is fixed, right? http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/57/steps/test/logs/stdio
 hushell	HeikoS: okay, I got the point! Thanks!
@wiking	gsomix: dunno, but i've just restarted the travis osx job as well
@wiking	gsomix: but most likely yes
@HeikoS	hushell: not a big thing, just helps me in getting rid of all memory errors :)

 votjakovr	wiking: and i'd like to have it on travis :)
 lambday	changed
 lambday	testing on the new machine
@wiking	votjakovr: yeah first let me make it locally
@wiking	:)
@wiking	votjakovr: which class should use NLopt?
 votjakovr	wiking: GradientModelSelection
@wiking	votjakovr: ok lets see if it compiles
@wiking	;)
@sonney2k	whose is this RationalApproximationCGMJob.compute failing on osx?
@wiking	sonney2k: lambday
 lambday	wiking: yes
@sonney2k	lambday, http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/58/steps/test/logs/stdio
 lambday	sonney2k: checking
 lambday	direct_result evaluates to -inf !!!!
 lambday	direct result is what we get using eigen3
 lambday	wait I am checking more
 lambday	sonney2k: the reference value I am checking it against is the value computed using a direct eigen3 linear solver - which is giving -inf... I am not sure why that is... I am testing
 lambday	I never got this error on linux :-/
 lambday	sonney2k: a temporary solution would be to put the actual value to check it with, instead of using eigen3 to generate that value....
@sonney2k	HeikoS, still around?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add BUNDLE_NLOPT option to build and link NLopt as external project
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: enable BUNDLE_NLOPT on travis
@wiking	votjakovr: ^
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes but about to go, whats up?
@sonney2k	lambday, hmmhh maybe it is a numerically not so stable case?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, about booking flights?
@HeikoS	yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, if we want to share a car then we should sync
@sonney2k	if not then not :)
 lambday	sonney2k: HeikoS I don't think that is so... this is a simple diagonal matrix :(
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  we already agreed we want that right? I would also like to share the flight, otherwise its boring
@HeikoS	we can do shogun hacking in the plane :D
 votjakovr	wiking: thank you very much!!! :)
@sonney2k	so my plans were to leave on friday and then go back friday or so
@HeikoS	lambday: since when do you have the error?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so I should bring 3 notebooks just in case :D
 lambday	HeikoS: I didn't... sonney2k discovered this error on osx :(
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I am pretty much fine with everything
@HeikoS	flexible
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I will bring mine certainly :)
 lambday	I never noticed it
@sonney2k	lambday, I can run stuff on this osx machine if it helps...
@HeikoS	lambday: so its arch dependent?
 lambday	sonney2k: alright.. I will test and will let you know
@HeikoS	then it cannot be a numerical issue right?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, do you know when sergey is flying?
 lambday	HeikoS: its a unit-test.. I am checking a value generated from our algo against a direct eigen3 linear solver for complex.... the problem is... in osx, the eigen3 one is giving -inf as answer
 lambday	HeikoS: I don't have any idea why is that
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so friday-friday is ok for you?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so we two can go together
@HeikoS	sonney2k: are you maybe flying over london?
@HeikoS	then I can meet you there?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: better ask him yourself, I dont think he has planned yet,
@HeikoS	sonney2k: which dates are those?
@HeikoS	18-25
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	its fine
@HeikoS	time wise, I would prefer something human
@HeikoS	sonney2k: question is: are you going over london?
@HeikoS	or am I going over Berlin
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well we have to leave in the morning to arrive around 4-5 pm at the hotel an be in time for dinner
@sonney2k	HeikoS, are there direct flights from london?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: no idea, I can check tonight though
@HeikoS	which city?
@HeikoS	are we going to?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, SFO

 lambday	you guys are going for mentor summit? :)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: btw what about leaving one day earlier? to have things a bit more relaxed?
@sonney2k	lambday, yeah
 lambday	:)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: there are direct flights from london
@sonney2k	HeikoS, when?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: what when?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, when are the flights?
@sonney2k	I mean arrival / departure
@HeikoS	sonney2k: well we can choose
@HeikoS	http://www.britishairways.com/travel/fx/public/en_gb?eId=111011&timestamp=0828061850#
@HeikoS	does that link work for you?
@HeikoS	1145 - 1435
@HeikoS	for example
@HeikoS	on 18th
@HeikoS	that would also work for you to come here
@sonney2k	no doesn't
@HeikoS	since 1145 is not too early
@HeikoS	quite cheap
@HeikoS	is the one 14==-1650
@HeikoS	1400
@HeikoS	263 punds
@HeikoS	the 11-45-1435 is 464
@HeikoS	you can search for yourself
@HeikoS	some connection flights are also cheaper
@HeikoS	but I prefer a direct one
@HeikoS	sonney2k: have a look what would work for you, I have to go home now, should we discuss tomorrow afternoon?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, flights are pretty expensive over heathrow :/
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  how about from berlin?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: this is british airways which is a bit more exp
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I will google a bit tonight to find cheaper ones
@sonney2k	907 EUR
@sonney2k	HeikoS, how much is yours?
@HeikoS	cheapest is about 600
@HeikoS	more expensive is about 900-1000
@HeikoS	depends
@sonney2k	HeikoS, 700-800 is what I find otherwise
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I will google a bit tonight and let you know tomorrow
@HeikoS	you can do the same for berlin
@HeikoS	then we can compare
@HeikoS	maybe it makes sense to fly seperately
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well I selected the one that gets us to SFO at 14:35
@HeikoS	sonney2k: what about arriving one day earlier?
@HeikoS	then its easier to sync
@HeikoS	sonney2k: gotta run off now, sorry. see you tomorrow
 lambday	going for dinner - sonney2k: I will check into that issue.. will send you some tests for osx probably :/
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ok tomorrow then cu
@sonney2k	lambday, yeah I am not around today much longer anyway
 lambday	sonney2k: will mail you :)
