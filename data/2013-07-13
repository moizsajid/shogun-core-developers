@sonney2k	wiking, iglesiasg already at TU?
@sonney2k	van51, around?
@sonney2k	gsomix, how is the .csv stuff doing?
 van51	sonney2k: yea
 van51	sonney2k: hi
@sonney2k	van51, I am wondering a bit about the PR
@sonney2k	van51, so it is for dense features right?
 van51	sonney2k: yes
 gsomix	sonney2k, hi. I have some questions.
@sonney2k	I mean you compress dense features
@sonney2k	van51, I am not sure anyone would even do that
 foulwall	sonney2k , I almost finish the ocr demo, when I finish, i'll push it on nn.7nn.de and show you
@sonney2k	van51, I mean when you can laod the data into memory why not use it?
 van51	sonney2k: i did that because that's what we had discussed
@sonney2k	van51, it would make a lot of sense for sparse features though
 van51	sonney2k: but reasons for doing it
@sonney2k	foulwall, cool
 van51	sonney2k: would be to introduced this randomness from the dim reduction
@sonney2k	gsomix, where are they?
 gsomix	sonney2k, should csv reader work with quotes?
 van51	sonney2k: I am also working on a sparse features equivalent btw
 gsomix	sonney2k, what to do with multi-typed csv files?
@sonney2k	gsomix, would be cool
 van51	sonney2k: I'm not arguing it will be used.. you re probably right. I can just submit another PR later on about the sparse features
@sonney2k	gsomix, we don't have multi-typed in shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, I mean I can write methods for mono-typed csv - readVector and readMatrix. And some methods for reading cell by cell - readInt, readString...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: yeah! sorry for the delay, I was grabbing some food
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, what do you prefer? templated CSVReader class with SGVector<T> readVector() and SGMatrix<T> readMatrix() methods?
 gsomix	or not templated class with many readIntVector(), readByteVector()...
@sonney2k	foulwall, I showed parts of your demos at the workshop. People were very excited and liked it :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, what produces less code :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, there is no one who does understand better. food -> priority
 gsomix	sonney2k, today is coding session on workshop?
@sonney2k	van51, for sparse it makes a lot of sense
@sonney2k	gsomix, today and tomorrow yes
 van51	sonney2k: ok I'll have it done in a couple hours :)
@sonney2k	I am still in the train to get there
 van51	sonney2k: I'll close that PR
@sonney2k	van51, well maybe not
@sonney2k	it might make sense for some cases when you do streaming again
@sonney2k	or need speed
@sonney2k	or a classifier that requires little memory
 van51	sonney2k: streaming would be a different class though
 gsomix	sonney2k, cool. unfortunately I can only watch part of your and Sergey's reports.
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: so when are you coming? :)
@sonney2k	van51, true but it will be written in a way that it uses the same functions
@sonney2k	so not really code duplication
 gsomix	sonney2k, ahh, and one more question. should I replace FILE* by shogun's File class?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am in the train. I left directly from the swimming hall
@sonney2k	van51, so let me merge this then
 van51	sonney2k: but they are instance methods atm

@iglesiasg	sonney2k: cool!
@sonney2k	van51, well easy to fix right?
 van51	sonney2k: yeah I guess
 van51	sonney2k: btw a friend of mine is sitting an exam on Monday and I may have to help her
 van51	sonney2k: so I may be offline this weekend on irc
@sonney2k	gsomix, errm isn't CSVReader derived from CFile?
 van51	sonney2k: but I'll keep working
 gsomix	sonney2k, nope. should be? ok. :)
@sonney2k	van51, foulwall, gsomix I am going on vacations tomorrow (for 3 weeks) but I bought some prepaid card so I will have internet access usually around maybe 10 UTC / 19 UTC+
 van51	sonney2k: ah nice :) have fun :D
 van51	sonney2k: as long as you reply to emails I'm ok :p
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah well your class will basically replace ASCIIReader
 foulwall	:) sonney2k have fun
@sonney2k	sure email might be better for communication but of course chat is possible but not spontaneously
@sonney2k	gsomix, so this answers the question about templated vs non-templated :/
@sonney2k	CFile doesn't use templates
@sonney2k	so you also cannot
@wiking	mmm
@sonney2k	gsomix, so all you have to do is implement the get_ and set_* functions
@sonney2k	wiking, yes?
 gsomix	sonney2k, can I use some magic of macroses/defines?
@wiking	sonney2k: what does check_complex_supported_class suppose to do
@sonney2k	wiking, ask Heiko!
@wiking	sonney2k: we have a problem that:  TypeError: object of type 'filter' has no len()
@wiking	in python3
@sonney2k	gsomix, look at ascii reader and you will see that we do this too!
 gsomix	ah, ok. IIRC get_, set_ works with memory blocks directly. should replace by SGVectors?
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. ^__^'
@sonney2k	gsomix, but it doesn't use your line reader...
@wiking	ok i see lambday commmited
@wiking	i'll ask heiko
@sonney2k	gsomix, do it with pointers for the moment - a switch would mean you also have to change all *File Classes
@sonney2k	possible but quite some work
 gsomix	maybe I can to do this scheme: CFile (low-level functions for reading) -> CLineReader (with some method for reading lines and basic types) -> CSVReader (high-level reading of structured file).
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	gsomix, look at File.h
 gsomix	ok
 gsomix	sonney2k, I get what do you mean now.
 gsomix	I should not change CFile interface.
 gsomix	CFile -> CSVReader (that uses LineReader for parsing). right?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well we missed you
@sonney2k	you should consider to stop by for some short time at least
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I think I have seen mueggelsee when I was in plane
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, might be
 lisitsyn	I believe so :D
@sonney2k	berlin has lots of lakes
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: my vision is totally bad so I am not sure
 lisitsyn	but there was lake and we like landed in a minute
@sonney2k	mueggelsee is berlins biggest lake
@sonney2k	so chances are good that this was the one ;)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah no idea how do you get to the other side
@sonney2k	across the lake is just 3.5km
@sonney2k	but it is kind of an ellipsoid
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I mean if you swim 3.5km is like ehmm
@sonney2k	so this is the longer one
 lisitsyn	how many hours? 2? 3?
@sonney2k	maybe 1:15 to 1:30
@sonney2k	not so fast
 lisitsyn	oh really?
 lisitsyn	I am bad in such timing
@sonney2k	I guess the best swim the thing in half the time
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I have visited: zoo, siegessaeule, reichstag, brandenburger tor, bundesrat, alexanderplatz, checkpoint charlie
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: can you suggest anything particular to add?
 lisitsyn	we walked through tiergarten (all the streets here) and visited rosengarten too
 lisitsyn	berliner dom too
 lisitsyn	humboldt university etc
 lisitsyn	all the things on this street
@sonney2k	you are japanese!
 lisitsyn	friedrichstrasse I guess

 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I believe I am not :D
@sonney2k	I think you have seen more of berlin than me
 lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	well the region around hackischer markt is hip
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: we also have been to moabit
 lisitsyn	I don't want to get there anymore
@sonney2k	the western center around zoologischer garten / kudamm is not so much but also a tourist thing
@sonney2k	I think the nicest part really is around the 'Dom'
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: kudamm and zoo are just like in 1km from me so we walked here already
 lisitsyn	I am scaried with moabit
@sonney2k	with alexanderplatz, hackescher markt
@sonney2k	there is tons of museums at museumsinsel
@sonney2k	like pergamon museum (famous)
@sonney2k	not sure if you are into such stuff
 lisitsyn	I don't know too!
@sonney2k	that might be something but it is big...
@sonney2k	there is one thing if the weather is nice
@sonney2k	you could go to jannowitzbruecke again
@sonney2k	and take a boat ride
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh thanks for suggestions!
@sonney2k	these are pretty neat
@sonney2k	there is one tour that goes through 100 bridges or so
@sonney2k	through east/west
@sonney2k	so you will see everything again from the water
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: by spree or that channel between ku'damm and tiergarten?
@sonney2k	yeah spree and some channel
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: bus 100 is awesome I think we should ride it
 lisitsyn	have you tried it?
@sonney2k	http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/dampferfahrten/schiffstouren-schifffahrten/2484915-2502534-schiffstour-brueckenfahrt-23-kilometer-k.html
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes they kept that bus for tourists :)
@sonney2k	http://www.berlinberlin.de/Schiffahrten/brueckentour-berlin.html
@sonney2k	I guess you have seen potsdamer platz and the 'hauptbahnhof'
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah we have been to potsdamer twice or so
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: we had lunch at some 'FBI' cafe
 lisitsyn	with fernando
 lisitsyn	oh my god it was awful
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok actually that is the tour that I meant http://www.sternundkreis.de/de/Unsere-Touren/Innenstadt/Brueckenfahrt-ab-Friedrichstr./K235.htm
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, it takes 3.5 hrs
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah potsdamer platz is for tourists too
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: if you have some enemy
 lisitsyn	just say 'visit FBI at potsdamer platz'
 lisitsyn	and take rice with cous cous sauce
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: thanks for the tour suggestion
@sonney2k	you can buy tickets directly at jannowitzbruecke etc
 lisitsyn	that's nice
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: because I still don't know how to buy tickets for bus
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	anyway I think you have seen quite  alot already
@sonney2k	you could also visit 'gaerten der welt'
@sonney2k	some gardens
@sonney2k	I mean a biiiig park
@sonney2k	with lots of flowers maze's and stuff
 lisitsyn	let me check
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: my parents would be happy to see such photos haha
@sonney2k	http://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berlin/sights/garden/garten-der-welt

@sonney2k	or you could visit http://www.potsdam-park-sanssouci.de/
@sonney2k	or even better the TU berlin :P
 lisitsyn	haha okay I will consider that but can't promise anything
 lisitsyn	as I am not alone and vote :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, anyways have nice holidays I am tired now. That's been looong days
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well people are around 11-16 or so
@sonney2k	but wiking has to leave early
 lisitsyn	I see
@sonney2k	so rather have a 1-2 hour look in the morning and then do some sightseeing
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: alright
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: so then take some rest
@sonney2k	you could walk from ernst-reuter platz
 lisitsyn	nice holidays for you too
 lisitsyn	uh no idea where it is
@sonney2k	the place where love parade used to end
 lisitsyn	ahh strasse des siebenzehn juni
 lisitsyn	I have been quite near
@sonney2k	yes
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: my opinion is that it is the best street in berlin btw
 lisitsyn	(from what I have seen)
@sonney2k	I like unter den linden more
@sonney2k	but hey I must say that I am from the 'east'
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sowjetische!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: and I must complain deutsch is a bit complex sometimes
 lisitsyn	I have a few dictionaries on my phone
 lisitsyn	and no dictionary had gaenge
 lisitsyn	so when we was to traube restaraunt
 lisitsyn	(that's the only place I have seen that word)
 lisitsyn	I asked 'sorry what is gaenge' :D
 lisitsyn	shameful as usual
@sonney2k	nothing to worry about
@sonney2k	berlin is full of tourist in the summer
@sonney2k	so you are not alone and they want YOUR money so they have to behave so you cannot ask a question that is too ``stupid''
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you have seen I am like freezed due to limited languages experience
