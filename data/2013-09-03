@iglesiasg	hushell, hey there
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-107-20-114-62.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has joined #shogun
 travis-ci	[travis-ci] it's Heiko Strathmann's turn to pay the next round of drinks for the massacre he caused in shogun-toolbox/shogun: http://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/10907804

@iglesiasg	what happened with travis, we have lost it :(
 hushell	iglesiasg: :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: have you tried Mosek in the new build system?
@iglesiasg	hushell, so to set up Mosek with CMake
@iglesiasg	hushell, no, I haven't
 hushell	I can't find an option to set it up
@iglesiasg	hushell, because there is not such an option
@iglesiasg	the right way to do it would be adding a FindMosek.cmake file similar to the ones in the cmake/ directory
 hushell	in CMake, we should have a FIND_PACKAGE(Mosek), right?
 hushell	yes
@iglesiasg	hushell, if you want to just use it for yourself
@iglesiasg	you can probably set up something faster that works just locally
 hushell	or I write a FindMosek.cmake?
 hushell	okay, so I have to modify the CMakeList.txt?
@iglesiasg	hushell, well, if you think you can do that easily, go ahead
@iglesiasg	otherwise, I would say you rather focus on the stuff for the SO project :)
 hushell	I found the Makefile generated by CMake is hard to read
@iglesiasg	no idea how hard is to write a .cmake file
@iglesiasg	yeah sure, that Makefile is not to be read or edited hehe
@iglesiasg	that's why of using CMake
 hushell	:D
@iglesiasg	using a couple of set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ...)
 hushell	okay, I'll find a way to add -lmosek
@iglesiasg	pointing to your local dirs were your Mosek is placed should be enough to get it working locally
@iglesiasg	hushell, however there is another thing that is more important
@iglesiasg	so as you are experiencing yourself, our parameter learning methods for SO suck
@iglesiasg	BMRM works fine for the stuff that Michal tested but it seems non-trivial to get it working with new stuff
@iglesiasg	and my PrimalMosekSOSVM relies on Mosek, which is a pain too
 hushell	iglesiasg: I see
@iglesiasg	one important part of your project is focused on improving this
@iglesiasg	with subgradient descent and the Frank-Wolfe
@iglesiasg	subgradient descent should be easy, I think
 hushell	iglesiasg: I thought about implementing the SGD in one day to check my FactorGraphModel code
@iglesiasg	hushell, I think it would be a good idea to include a good SGD implementation
@iglesiasg	that works with all the models
 hushell	yeah, anything involves 3rd party code is painful
@iglesiasg	so I don't know
 hushell	iglesiasg: my idea is try your Mosek solver first and then go to SGD
@iglesiasg	I'd prefer if you could implement that and get it stable in Shogun rather than fighting to get Mosek to work with it
@iglesiasg	but as you wish
 hushell	since I understand your code more or less
@iglesiasg	feel free to comment and modify as you find suitable so it gets more understandable than less :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I think your cutting plane implementation is good
 hushell	yeah, the learning is more complex than inference, so if any part goes wrong, the whole story crashes
@iglesiasg	do you think so about learning and inference?
 hushell	iglesiasg: Thanks for the suggestions, maybe few hours everything be fine :)
@iglesiasg	I think that inference is the hard part
 hushell	iglesiasg: yes, but learning calls inference all the time
 hushell	this is very risky
@iglesiasg	hushell, why is it risky?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I mean if anything is wrong in inference
 hushell	just a feeling :)
@iglesiasg	hehe ok
 hushell	okay, I go ahead to fix my problem.
 hushell	iglesiasg: Good nite!
@iglesiasg	hushell, good luck, bye!

 gsomix	good morning
 besser82	mornin'
 gsomix	wiking, hey. I have a little problem related to cmake.
 gsomix	wiking, look
 gsomix	 CMake Error: Attempt to add a custom rule to output
 gsomix	 "/Workspace/shogun/build/src/interfaces/python_modular/Multiclass_includes.i.rule" which already has a custom rule.
 gsomix	after any changes in config with cmake/ccmake
 thoralf	Heyhey.
* gsomix away in uni
 thoralf	How bad.
* thoralf just burnt 180 CPU-hours just to make evaluation counts overflow. :(
 sonne|work	thoralf: how that?
 thoralf	sonne|work: I used int64_t for counting tp/fp/tn/fn
 sonne|work	so no way that this overflows...
 thoralf	You're right.
 thoralf	But it did.  Already looking for some implicit conversion...
 thoralf	sonne|work: tn = num_classes*num_labels - (tp+fp+tn); <-- only num_classes and num_labels are 32 bit.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Is it possible that some implicit cast happened?
 thoralf	tn = int64_t(num_classes)*int64_t(num_labels) - (tp+fp+tn); <-- I dont want to write this.
 thoralf	sonne|work: The result of (int32_t*int32_t) is int32_t, even if assigned to something bigger.
 sonne|work	thoralf: sure
 sonne|work	that is why we should do int64_t(int32_t) before
 thoralf	sonne|work: I could have seen this, but I was dump. ;)
 thoralf	sonne|work: Lesson learned.
 thoralf	Big data is not only about big machines. ;)
 thoralf	sonne|work: Would you argue against (1l*int32_t*int32_t)?
 thoralf	Too hacky? ;)
 thoralf	Hmm. 1l could depend on the platform.

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: that is weird! tit hsould!
 sonne|work	it should
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I couldn't reproduce the octave crasher either nor could pickle27
 sonne|work	so I guess it is some local issue
@iglesiasg	oh, ok
@iglesiasg	it does not prevent me from working with octave so I can live with it
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: you should try if a recent swig version would fix it and also that you don't have some clashes w/ other versions of libshogun
 sonne|work	and that you did compile on *this* machine you run octave on
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I compiled in the machine I am running octave, sure
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: iglesiasg: what would you use with boolean features?
 lisitsyn	supervised classification
@iglesiasg	mmm let's see
 lisitsyn	say 128 bits
@iglesiasg	why not an SVM?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I didn't say anything about it so far ;)
 lisitsyn	linear SVM?

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: binary classification -> SVM
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: haha
 lisitsyn	sounds like the only method?
 lisitsyn	well that's what I was going to use indeed
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what do you think about some distance based method like KNN?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: need real-time
 iglesiasg	using trees it should be possible
 lisitsyn	so either linear explicit feature map or linear
 lisitsyn	I'd like to save some time there
 lisitsyn	some preprocessing eats CPU too

@iglesiasg	and we should update the README
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: any idea about those failing builds ^
@HeikoS	I have no idea what causes this
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, me neither, ensemble unit tests
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: and whats with the python integration tests failing all of a sudden?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thats since here
@HeikoS	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/10890165
@iglesiasg	yeah I noticed that we lost travis yesterday
@HeikoS	string file modular
@HeikoS	argh these integration tests cause nothing but annoyance
@HeikoS	any idea why it fails?
@iglesiasg	no idea at all
@iglesiasg	it makes no sense for me
@HeikoS	Traceback (most recent call last):  File "tester.py", line 182, in <module>    got=get_split_string(f[1])  File "tester.py", line 106, in get_split_string    strs.extend(e.replace('\\n','\n').splitlines())AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'replace'
@HeikoS	no attribute replace?
@iglesiasg	including an octave modular example breaks python modular integration test
@iglesiasg	it is crazy
@HeikoS	probably some python things changed in travis or so
@iglesiasg	so is it broken in all the builds from that one_
@iglesiasg	?
@HeikoS	File "tester.py", line 106, in get_split_string
@HeikoS	strs.extend(e.replace('\\n','\n').splitlines())
@iglesiasg	you are right, it seems to be about Python
@iglesiasg	let me ask in travis IRC channel
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/42ca7de15c98c26cf75ad10e5b56109292058d69
@HeikoS	this is the commit responsible
@HeikoS	sonne|work: any idea?
@iglesiasg	aaah I see
@HeikoS	also, rather than using '\n', one should use os.linesep
@HeikoS	for platform safety
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, mm but I don't think it is just that commit
@iglesiasg	that was made 4 months ago
@iglesiasg	and travis have been green since that
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I know, but that is the line
@iglesiasg	got it
@HeikoS	so something probably has changed in travis
@HeikoS	and now this idea doesnt work anymore
@iglesiasg	that is it
@iglesiasg	I think your idea using os.linesep should be the right way
 votjakovr	HeikoS: do you have any ideas, why we are using MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes) instead of BFGS? NLopt provides both of them
@HeikoS	votjakovr: for ML2?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I have no idea why this decision was made ;)
@HeikoS	what is used in GPML and GPStuff?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: BFGS in GPML
@HeikoS	votjakovr: do you know about this mma method?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: not yet :)
@HeikoS	do you know how they compare to each other?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moving_asymptotes
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1620240207/abstract;jsessionid=A02B054610BF4FAA529A002CFC023A35.d03t04
 votjakovr	HeikoS: thanks, i'll check
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I have no idea
@HeikoS	votjakovr: is there any documentaion about the decision?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: nope
@HeikoS	votjakovr: is it easy to switch between the methods?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe we can add an enum that selects the method
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, just change enum
@HeikoS	votjakovr: then we can offer both and set a default value
@HeikoS	votjakovr: we can compare both methods on some easy and hard problems and then see
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah sure
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok cool
 votjakovr	HeikoS: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Algorithms
 votjakovr	HeikoS: we also could use other algorithms
 votjakovr	HeikoS: check local gradient-based optimization section
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I dont know too much about these unconstrained optimization problems
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so I would rather stick with the decision made in GPML
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, me too, i'd like to try to get the same result with GPML and then try some other methods and see the differences
@HeikoS	votjakovr: sounds like a good plan?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep, then i'll change default method to BFGS
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok, go ahead! btw are things already starting to work?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: sorry, not yet, working on it
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok, let me know how things develop :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: btw i also changed constructor in gradient model selection, which allows not to pass the tree
 votjakovr	HeikoS: and use all the parameters
@HeikoS	votjakovr: nice!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: does this "using all parameters" already work?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: not yet :)

@HeikoS	what does it do? compare gradients against finite difference approximation?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I think this should be moved to unit tests, they did not exist last year
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, great, i think so
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but we should do it in a gernal way
@HeikoS	votjakovr: imagine people implement the gradients in a wrong way
@HeikoS	votjakovr: we should check for this
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so woul dbe good to have a class that does this for all classes that implement gradients
 votjakovr	HeikoS: DifferentiableFunction ?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yes
@HeikoS	votjakovr: what do you think?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah i think that is good, to move these functionality there
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i mean there: http://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/evaluation/DifferentiableFunction.h

 pickle27	iglesiasg: nope no graphics in the upload
@iglesiasg	pickle27, all right, cool!
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I think there is a typo in the third block of code, the one that generates the first figures
@iglesiasg	Abdomonal -> Abdominal
 pickle27	ahh indeed
 pickle27	okay I will fix and make a PR soon, I asked Andreas to have a look so I'll wait for his feedback
@iglesiasg	good
@iglesiasg	pickle27, and the data file, is on purpose called foetal? I mean it because of the o
 pickle27	iglesiasg: thats the exact name of the file downloaded from the website, I just left it
@iglesiasg	good then!
@iglesiasg	pickle27, apologies for being annoying :)
 pickle27	iglesiasg: haha no I appreciate people taking the time to look through my stuff!
@iglesiasg	pickle27, it is nice
@iglesiasg	pickle27, how is it known that the baby's heart rate is twice the mother's?
@iglesiasg	just out of curiosity hehe
 pickle27	iglesiasg: I;m not sure but apparently it is a fact
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: my sister is pregnant and told me a few days ago ;)
@iglesiasg	hehe ok, so it is something well known
 pickle27	iglesiasg: Andreas did the analysis, Im not much of a bio guy
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, tell her that she can see her baby's heart rate using Shogun :)
 pickle27	HeikoS: haha yes
@HeikoS	haha :D

 pickle27	sonney2k: wiking iglesiasg did you guys see my PR for the ruby modular interface? Just wondering what people think
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I didn't check that one at all
 pickle27	okay cool, any thoughts on updating to nmatrix from narray>
@iglesiasg	I have no idea about that, sorry :S
@iglesiasg	what did this guy in the mailing list that seemed to know about Ruby say?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: not much, he was advocating a different but no longer maintained numerical lib
@iglesiasg	mm I see
 pickle27	for me the whole point is that nmatrix is active
 pickle27	in general python is much preferred to ruby for science so there isn't a great numerical lib
@iglesiasg	aham
@iglesiasg	I have no real preference about this
 pickle27	but nmatrix and sciruby are active and trying to change that
@iglesiasg	and honestly are you saying, I don't think that will be used a lot since Python is preferred
@iglesiasg	it can be good then to move to nmatrix and sciruby
 pickle27	iglesiasg: main reason I care is because my job next year will be in ruby
 pickle27	so just playing around really
@iglesiasg	pickle27, will you be doing machine learning in Ruby you think?
 pickle27	I do think it will be the right move eventually to go with nmatrix
 pickle27	ummm yeah I expect to be doing some machine learning
 pickle27	my job is web dev backend
