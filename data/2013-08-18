-!- Heiko [5accf27c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.90.204.242.124] has joined #shogun
 Heiko	lisitsyn: hey!
 lisitsyn	Heiko: hey again :)
 Heiko	how is it going?
 lisitsyn	still ok ;)
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I was kind of researching 'parameters' thing
 Heiko	you mean how shogun parameters?
 lisitsyn	I'd say I have been doing that for a while though
 lisitsyn	not really shogun but paraemeters in general
 Heiko	ok you mean how to register etc?
 lisitsyn	Heiko: what I came with is https://github.com/lisitsyn/stichwort
 Heiko	getter setter
 lisitsyn	yes more in this direction
 Heiko	sweet stichwort :)
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I broke my mind with casting idea - wanted to make it support implicit casts
 lisitsyn	like you assign keyword to int and get float
 Heiko	ah sweet that looks nice!
 Heiko	are there some more examples?
 lisitsyn	Heiko: not yet
 lisitsyn	well I added some unit-tests to be sure it works
 Heiko	ravis fails
 lisitsyn	Heiko: the workflow with that thing is
 lisitsyn	I know
 lisitsyn	I have C++11 issues :D
 lisitsyn	so you define keyword
 lisitsyn	Keyword<double> width("width", 10.0);
 lisitsyn	then you define function
 hushell	wiking: Does 'sudo make install' need to be executed before ctest?
 lisitsyn	hmm say
 Heiko	lisitsyn: so this uses maps internally?
 lisitsyn	bool train(Parameters ps);
 lisitsyn	you obtain the provided value with ps[width]
 lisitsyn	and call the function with
 lisitsyn	train({width=3.0})
 lisitsyn	Heiko: well it uses more C++ than I ever knew about :D
 Heiko	looks quite nice, why is not not yet in shogun?
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I guess it is crazy slow
 lisitsyn	Heiko: the main challenge with it is I try to keep the Parameter class non-templated
 lisitsyn	Parameter = Keyword<T> + T
 lisitsyn	i.e. width = 3.0 is the instance of Parameter
 lisitsyn	that uses some internal shit underneath
 lisitsyn	:D
 Heiko	sweet
 Heiko	speed is a concern though
 Heiko	setters should be fast
 lisitsyn	no that doesn't solve setters problem
 lisitsyn	as it has nothing to do with swig
 Heiko	ah ok
 Heiko	cool stuff though
 Heiko	c++11 is really cool
 lisitsyn	Heiko: actually it worked with older C++
 Heiko	finally one gets the syntactic stuff that one wants and that is possible to offer
 lisitsyn	the only difference was
 lisitsyn	train(kwargs[width=3.0])
 lisitsyn	not a big deal
 lisitsyn	Heiko: {} is possible due to std::initializer_list
 lisitsyn	Heiko: you may find std::optional<T> convenient too btw
 lisitsyn	but it is C++14 :D
 lisitsyn	lol
 lisitsyn	I pushed DIY version of it to my code though
 Heiko	lisitsyn: cool!
 lisitsyn	Heiko: std::optional is used to represent a value that might not be present
 lisitsyn	so you don't have to deal with pointers or whatever
 Heiko	lisitsyn: wow I wonder how you cam eup with all this cool stuff
 Heiko	very nice
 lisitsyn	Heiko: what exactly?
 Heiko	so how can we get rid of pointers in shogun?
 Heiko	:D
 lisitsyn	Heiko: no pointers are inside of shogun due to very OOP design
 Heiko	?
 lisitsyn	a lot of related objects
 lisitsyn	Heiko: what's the deal with pointers btw? :)
 lisitsyn	do you mean raw pointers we have?
 Heiko	yeah
 lisitsyn	shared_ptr :)

 lisitsyn	Heiko: we have to find a solution for setters/getters
 Heiko	lisitsyn: would be nice
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I hate them! :D
 Heiko	lisitsyn: btw I would still drop the grid-search things
 Heiko	yeah would be so nice
 Heiko	in particular for modular bindings
 lisitsyn	Heiko: each time I find a way it breaks with something else
 Heiko	although I guess proper examples which illustrate real problems would cause us to write all getters we need )
 Heiko	lisitsyn: I am counting on you!
 lisitsyn	Heiko: in python we might have svm.parameter(width=3)
 lisitsyn	as keywords can be converted to strings
 Heiko	should have something for all languages
 lisitsyn	and they are not to be defined anywhere
 lisitsyn	but this fails for java
 Heiko	I think its not a good idea to do things specific to single languages
 lisitsyn	most of things fail for java
 lisitsyn	yes totally bad idea
 Heiko	what about using strings?
 Heiko	is this too slow?
 lisitsyn	that's ok
 Heiko	say we have a c backend for it
 lisitsyn	well a bit slower
 lisitsyn	we have other problem here
 Heiko	question is does it matter if its slow?
 Heiko	which is?
 lisitsyn	how to get the type :D
 lisitsyn	just think about the declaration of such a function
 lisitsyn	? parameter(const std::string& name);
 Heiko	we have a parameter type
 Heiko	TSGDatetype
 lisitsyn	okay lets have
 Heiko	its possible to match things maybe
 lisitsyn	Parameter parameter(const std::string& name)
 lisitsyn	the problem is I don't see a way to go from
 lisitsyn	Parameter
 lisitsyn	to say double
 lisitsyn	getDouble();
 lisitsyn	that's the only way I see
 lisitsyn	Heiko: that's essentially the same problem I met in that stichwort
 Heiko	yeah true, I ea it could be solved with runtime errors
 Heiko	user can call the method which exist for everything
 Heiko	and then if types dont match there is an error
 lisitsyn	I was stucked with no possible virtual template methods
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I don't mind such way to do that
 Heiko	lisitsyn: ah I dont know
 lisitsyn	no I mean runtime errors
 lisitsyn	I am ok with them
 Heiko	lisitsyn: did you see my suggestion for the obtain from generic thing?
 Heiko	lisitsyn: almost the only way (runtime errors)
 lisitsyn	auto generate things?
 Heiko	lisitsyn: yeah
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	that's the same wall
 lisitsyn	runtime vs compile-time
 lisitsyn	Heiko: swig obsoletes CRTP so no static polymorphism for us :(
 Heiko	lisitsyn: but the idea should work, no?
 lisitsyn	yes sure
 lisitsyn	Heiko: what you suggest is totally ok and should work
 Heiko	lisitsyn: so should we do it?
 Heiko	would at least solve all the mailing list questions ;0
 Heiko	\;)
 lisitsyn	yes as we have no other solution
 Heiko	lisitsyn: ok then, will push it a bit more this week
 lisitsyn	Heiko: the only other solution I can think of
 lisitsyn	is to preprocess headers somehow
 Heiko	lisitsyn: yes I also thought about that
 Heiko	but its tricky
 Heiko	its a bit annoying that c doesnt allow to modify classes in a different file
 Heiko	but I guess there are reasons for that
 lisitsyn	shogun_class(SVM)
 lisitsyn	{
 lisitsyn	}
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I think we could do that like that ^
@iglesiasg	oh you guys are on!
@iglesiasg	:)
 lisitsyn	the definition of such a macro is
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes, hey
 Heiko	lisitsyn: but then we have another layer
 Heiko	and everyone has to use it
 Heiko	while obtain from generic is only for a few
 Heiko	so I rather prefer a solution with global functions
 Heiko	iglesiasg: hi!
 lisitsyn	Heiko: yeah but later we can add more functions
 lisitsyn	Heiko: I guess what he have is just a typical stuff in every big project :)
 lisitsyn	a lot of classes and you have to sort the shit out

 Heiko	see you Monday probably when I have my computer back :)
@iglesiasg	Heiko, you still on holidays?
 lisitsyn	alright
 Heiko	iglesiasg: well its weekend and my machine is at work
 Heiko	btw I think we should meet in person this year again
 Heiko	but ets discuss that next dev meeting
 Heiko	see you, have a good night

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, do you think we could update a few things in the buildbot to solve the crashes ^?
