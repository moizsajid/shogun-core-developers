@wiking	OXPHOS: if you are touching CHAIDTree
@wiking	do you mind to fix a bug there?
 OXPHOS	wiking: I can try
@wiking	OXPHOS: lemme dig it out
@wiking	OXPHOS: one is rather simple: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2016-07-13-010034-30511-1/report-e95725.html#EndPath
 OXPHOS	wiking: not sure how to read it..what is the problem there?
@wiking	see the 5 steps
@wiking	it basically describe you a situation
@wiking	where you gonna have a null pointer exception
@wiking	when you do CDynamicObjectArray* children=node->get_children();
@wiking	coz
@wiking	node_t* node=current
@wiking	but there's never a check whether current != NUL
@wiking	L
@wiking	got it?
 OXPHOS	so there could be situation when current=NULL
 OXPHOS	just we need a check there
 OXPHOS	wiking^
@wiking	yeah i mean the easiest is that you add an assertation
@wiking	in the beginning of the function call of CLabels* CCHAIDTree::apply_from_current_node(SGMatrix<float64_t> fmat, node_t* current)
@wiking	that current != NULL
@wiking	it's a simple input value check for the function
 OXPHOS	wiking: kk i see
 OXPHOS	wiking: and for the sgvector serialization - any comments on the refcount? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3226
@wiking	yeah i'm gonna look into that now
@wiking	ok so another thing is
@wiking	can you login here: https://scan.coverity.com
@wiking	with your github accoutn?
 OXPHOS	wiking: "You are not associated with any projects"
 OXPHOS	In order to start using Scan you need to be associated with at least one project.
@wiking	ah
@wiking	can you tell me what is your email address associated with your github account?
 OXPHOS	engelzora@gmail.com
 OXPHOS	I can do "add me to the project"
@wiking	send you an invite
 OXPHOS	wiking: thx. I logged in.
@wiking	ok can u see now the shogun project?
@wiking	you should be able to view the defects
@wiking	i wonder if you can open this link: https://scan8.coverity.com/reports.htm#v11736/p10202/fileInstanceId=12508917&defectInstanceId=4294867&mergedDefectId=135945
@wiking	but once you can go to the defects you should try to look at the 135945 CID
@wiking	that's the CHAID related resource leak
@wiking	the thing is that it's rather complicated :)
@wiking	OXPHOS: so ok for sgvect
@wiking	so the thing is that we serialize the sgvec as part of a model right?
 OXPHOS	yep
@wiking	say i have a LinearMachine that has a weight vector
@wiking	SGVector<float64_t>
@wiking	w
@wiking	so you need to serialize the refcount structure
@wiking	because in this case there would be refcount = 1
@wiking	but thin kabout a more complicated model
 OXPHOS	like?
 OXPHOS	btw I saw the leaks
@wiking	what do yo umean lik?
@wiking	*like
 OXPHOS	oh I was waiting for your example about the "more complicated model"
 OXPHOS	wiking^
@wiking	well more complicated can be
@wiking	that you have some Label vector
@wiking	and say those are referenced my the machines in the bagging machine
@wiking	bagging machine like RF
@wiking	so that label vector would have like
@wiking	refcount = as many trees there are in RF
 OXPHOS	yeah..
@wiking	so yeah you have to set serialize the ref count
@wiking	at least the count
 OXPHOS	okay. yeah i was thinking i have to
@wiking	like i twas in the old serialization case right?
 OXPHOS	right
 OXPHOS	lemme see how to do this inheritance serialization
@wiking	mmm i mean you dont need to serialize the SGRef object itself
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	that's one way
 OXPHOS	wiking: I just need the m_refcount, i.e. RefCount class right? but m_refcount is private in SGRef. so I guess I have to go through SGRef
@wiking	OXPHOS: i mean the best is if you actually serialize the inherited things automatically
@wiking	if possible
@wiking	because that way if later there's a change in SGReferencedData then we dont need to modify anything in the serialization code
@wiking	and you need to go through SGReferencedData
@wiking	"class SGVector : public SGReferencedData"
@wiking	OXPHOS: http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/polymorphism.html
@wiking	^ that's your howto
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	wait maybe not enough
@wiking	but yeah you can define releation like
@wiking	CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION(SGVector, SGReferencedData)
@wiking	CEREAL_REGISTER_POLYMORPHIC_RELATION(SGMatrix, SGReferencedData)
@wiking	RefCount is just a member of SGReferencedData
@wiking	but yeah i guess that'd need a serialization method as well :)
@wiking	btw
 OXPHOS	saw it . thanks!
@wiking	OXPHOS: http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/inheritance.html
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	i have a question
@wiking	so the template<Archive> save/load_cereal(Archive& a) methods are currently implemented in cpp
@wiking	right?
 OXPHOS	yes
 OXPHOS	for sgobject
 OXPHOS	it's in sgvector.h
@wiking	OXPHOS: yep yep i mean sgobject
@wiking	would it be hard to move it to sgobject.h?
@wiking	because the problem is that even if you expose now the templated version of the save/load thingy
@wiking	the user will have to recompile shogun
@wiking	if she wants to serialize it into a new Archive format
@wiking	right?
 OXPHOS	I think all existed/specified formats will be compiled in the begining?
@wiking	ok so let me put it this way
 OXPHOS	the only solution i can see is to move the SGObejct::self from .cpp to .h. Not sure how bazdback like this
@wiking	there are now 3 formats
@wiking	right?
 OXPHOS	yes
@wiking	so what if i have a new Archive format
@wiking	a custom one
@wiking	because i'm a user like that
@wiking	and i wanna use that for serializing shogun
@wiking	objects
 OXPHOS	Yeah the codes has to be modified and everything will be re-compiled because it's SGObejct
@wiking	in that case the only option is that actually i make that part of shogun
@wiking	(the new format)
@wiking	and then i need to recompile
@wiking	ok so but if the templated load/save would be implemented in header
@wiking	this coudl be avoided right?
 OXPHOS	I think so
 OXPHOS	yeah right
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	the question is
@wiking	what is preventing us to be able to do this switch?
 OXPHOS	I need to iterate through the map, which is defined in .cpp
 OXPHOS	it's in a pimpl
 OXPHOS	wiking^
@wiking	ParametersMap?
 OXPHOS	wiking^ yes..it's self::map[basetag, any]
@wiking	ok i suppose we dont want to expose the self in .h because of map/unordered_map
@wiking	but lemme ask about this bazdback
@wiking	:)
 OXPHOS	kk
@wiking	so lets not merge that until we can resolve that either way
@wiking	:p
@wiking	i guess 12 hours more max

@wiking	i might be able to help
 sanuj	wiking, he suggested me to use sfinae to solve the plugin bug
@wiking	ah
 sanuj	i have read about sfinae and understand it a bit
@wiking	 yeah and wher ehave you got stuck with it?
 sanuj	but not sure how to solve that bug using sfinae
@wiking	i mean sfinae is all about not erroring when there's an unsupported type
 sanuj	wiking, https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/147180067#L1394
@wiking	just simply silently NOP

@wiking	sanuj: btw do you know of a good substitution for std::hash in none-c++11 case?
@wiking	you mean this
@wiking	/opt/shogun/src/shogun/lib/any.h:149:34: error: no match for 'operator==' (operand types are 'std::function<shogun::Some<shogun::MockBaseClass>()>' and 'std::function<shogun::Some<shogun::MockBaseClass>()>')
@wiking	?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	but i'm not comparing std::function anywhere explicitly
@wiking	what do you compare then?
@wiking	i know that you do a
@wiking	ASSERT_EQ()
@wiking	right?
 sanuj	EXPECT_EQ
@wiking	or that
@wiking	yeah
 sanuj	wiking, but the compiler error is not from there
@wiking	btw
@wiking	in any.h
@wiking	#include <string.h>
 sanuj	wiking, it happens while compiling this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3370/files#diff-7e05729c8a117ab30510a77a08865f33R1
@wiking	shouldn't that be <cstring>
@wiking	to be correct?
 sanuj	wiking, actually yes, i'll fix that
@wiking	k
 sanuj	wiking, but how to go about debugging this
 sanuj	how to use sfinae
 sanuj	is it for debugging or preventing the bug from happening?
@wiking	latter
@wiking	i mean you wanna be able to compile this code
@wiking	            return typed_storage == typed_other_storage;
@wiking	here typed_storage = std::function<shogun::Some<shogun::MockBaseClass>()>
@wiking	right?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	wiking, so i need to use sfinae in any.h so that it compiles

@wiking	sanuj: used to
@wiking	not lately

@wiking	:D
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	wiking, what's your phd on?

 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
@wiking	sanuj: medical image processing
@wiking	OXPHOS_: what you can do
@wiking	is do a clang++ -E
@wiking	that'll basically generate the whole file
 sanuj	wiking, i got an intern at this lab camp.lcsr.jhu.edu/intern/
@wiking	jhu is cool
 sanuj	they do robotics and vision in medicine
@wiking	OXPHOS_: so with that (g++ or clang++) doesn't matter
@wiking	-E will just generate the file, i.e. resolve all the macros
 OXPHOS_	wiking: thanks! lemme try
 OXPHOS_	sanuj: congrats!
 sanuj	OXPHOS_, thanks :D
 sanuj	wiking, you know any online sources from where i can learn about vision stuff related to augmented reality?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	scholar.google.com
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	:D
@wiking	you think i'm joking :)
 sanuj	nope :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: bazdmeg here?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeap
 sanuj	lisitsyn, in any.h, i did this
 sanuj	        bool equals(void** storage, void** other_storage) const
 sanuj	        {
 sanuj	            if(util::EqualExists<T>::value) {
 sanuj	                T typed_storage = *(reinterpret_cast<T*>(*storage));
 sanuj	                T typed_other_storage = *(reinterpret_cast<T*>(*other_storage));
 sanuj	                return typed_storage == typed_other_storage;
 sanuj	            }
 sanuj	            return true;
 sanuj	        }
 sanuj	where EqualExists checks if operator== is present
 lisitsyn	does it work?
 sanuj	no
 lisitsyn	I'd guess so
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	gives same compiler error
@wiking	lisitsyn: so question
 lisitsyn	quite obvious
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what exactly were you suggesting yesterday
 lisitsyn	wiking: what q?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: sfinae!
 lisitsyn	bool equals(void** storage, void** other_storage) const
 lisitsyn	this should be different when it comes to T
 lisitsyn	that doesn't support
 lisitsyn	==
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so i just make another "equals" implementation which just returns true ?
 sanuj	yeah
 lisitsyn	sanuj: oh this is quite dangerous
 lisitsyn	I'd prefer keeping it unimplemented
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you don't want to  implement operator== for any?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you'd need two declarations of operator==
 sanuj	or do i just declare a specialization of equals for std::function and not implement it?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah rather that
 sanuj	but is this sfinae?
 lisitsyn	bool equals(void** storage, void** other_storage, bool supports_equal=util::EqualExists<T>::value) const
 lisitsyn	I'd suggest something like that
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how will i use the supports_equal value in the function equals?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you don't use it
 lisitsyn	you just put default value there
 lisitsyn	so compiler chooses the right implementation
 sanuj	okay, let me try that
 sanuj	lisitsyn, is this function specialization based on its argument "supports_equal" rather than its template argument T?
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	or you can go with some other approach
 lisitsyn	not sure which is best here
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i think it's good to check for the existence for operator==
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but if we leave it undefined for the cases when operator== doesn't exist then how will it decide whether it's equal or not?
@wiking	lisitsyn: so in order to be able to put the template implementation of the serialization function of SGObject into the header (that way no need to recompile the whole library if one comes up with a new Archive type
@wiking	this requires self, i.e. the parameterMap to be defined in the header right?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: ^
@wiking	lisitsyn: pingooooo
 sanuj	wiking, is it possible to do function specialization based on its argument "supports_equal" rather than its template argument T?

@wiking	lisitsyn: okok so read those when u can and react
@wiking	(and comment on my pr)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3396
@wiking	i dont remember when was my last time
@wiking	that i sent a pr
 lisitsyn	wiking: SELF!
 lisitsyn	all the way
 lisitsyn	wiking: well this looks good
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.204.242.64] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	exactly what this is for
@wiking	ok cool
@wiking	i'll wait for travis
@wiking	but then i'll merge
@wiking	lisitsyn: but yeah any ideas about template<Archive>...?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah just read it but sorry don't really get the problem
 lisitsyn	is there some code?
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	lemme find the pr
@wiking	ok look here
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3375/files#diff-9c3599c0d2090e493be261b079e9b63eR523
@wiking	see the template<class Archive> void CSGObject::cereal_save(Archive& ar) const; is implemented in .cpp
@wiking	so now this is a shit
@wiking	if somebody comes with a new Archive format
@wiking	not the 3 default ones
@wiking	cereal::BinaryOutputArchive, cereal::JSONOutputArchive, cereal::XMLOutputArchive
@wiking	because if you specify a new serialization format
@wiking	then you have to recompile shogun
@wiking	while if the templated save/load would be implemented in SGObject.h
@wiking	see what i mean?
 lisitsyn	uh
 lisitsyn	so we want to support just any possible Archive?
 lisitsyn	I didn't know we do want it, now I get it
 lisitsyn	wiking: do we really want to support arbitrary Archives?
@wiking	i mean why not? :)
@wiking	i mean i dont care into what format the user wants to serialize
@wiking	if he want to serialize directly into memcached or redis
@wiking	i dont care
@wiking	if he implements the Archive interface he can do it
 lisitsyn	ok I get it
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok we need to bridge the gap between templated archive
 lisitsyn	and hidden .cpp things
 lisitsyn	wiking: argh
 lisitsyn	this is tough
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am not really a fan of what kind of rape happened to 'any'
 lisitsyn	:D
