 sonney2k	theoryno3, time to show us your leet skillz then ;-)
 theoryno3	sonney2k, Haha you must mean "l33t" ;-)
 sonney2k	indeed
 siddharth	sonney2k, I already have shogun working on my linux but I installed it before you transitioned shogun repositories to git
-!- dvevre [b49531e3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
 siddharth	so is it necessary to checkout shogun from git and compile?
 sonney2k	siddharth, yes sorry but it was about time to switch...
 sonney2k	siddharth, it is very easy too luckily
 sonney2k	just issue: git clone git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sonney2k	then compile as usual
 siddharth	ok :)

-!- makokal [~nyumbanil@te52.informatik.uni-bremen.de] has joined #shogun
 sonney2k	yes
 hiteshk	I had some questions about implementing machine learning algos project
 hiteshk	I had mailed the mentors mentioned on the website two days ago but no reply

 makokal	hi
 makokal	I also wanted to ask about some of the projects
 makokal	I wanted to work online learning
-!- siddharth [~siddharth@117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun
 sonney2k	makokal, ok makes sense - so what would you propose? a bit of the framework and some code pulling from vowpal wabbit
 makokal	exactly, I have pulled the code from vowpal and starting looking into it today
 makokal	to get a feeling
 makokal	then I can see a concrete way to go
 sonney2k	I think it would make sense to organize it in some way where you have streaming features, i.e. the learning algorihtm can only say: please give me the next example
 sonney2k	and that's it
 sonney2k	than write some functions that stream from files, network sockets or so (whatever vw does)
 makokal	ya
 makokal	I'm still getting my head around whats exists so far
 makokal	thanks sonney2k for the bits
 sonney2k	makokal, np ...
 sonney2k	hiteshk, whom did you email?

 hiteshk	I mailed Vojtech Franc
 hiteshk	and  Soeren Sonnenburg
 sonney2k	hiteshk, I am Soeren... so I must have missed the email
 hiteshk	I am interested in the project Implement SVMbright a GPL'ed version of SVMLight and make it publicly available and have read the Joachims98 ref that you have given
 hiteshk	I am quite versed with SVMs , could you tell me what I should write in my proposal
 sonney2k	hiteshk, well then the the plan how you would implemt all the parts of the svmlight paper
 sonney2k	you cannot look at the svmlight source code for that though
 hiteshk	svmlight paper is the same as Joachims98 ref right , do you want me to tell plan the language and the timetable
 sonney2k	well C++ and finish before the end :)
 sonney2k	I guess, 1) basic chunking algo 2) selection of working set 3) kernel caching 4) shrinking 5) linear case speedup and porting of some things from svmlight (that I wrote) to svmbright

 hiteshk	the algos are written in the paper , so what do I write in my proposal
 sonney2k	?
 sonney2k	well how you would implement them?
 sonney2k	e.g. function names, time line / how you keep e.g. alphas such things
 hiteshk	Ok , so a detailed design
 sonney2k	I mean the algos in the paper are not C++ but just pseudocode.
 hiteshk	ya got it , I also wanted to know about Implement framework for online learning project

@sonney2k	otherwise it is not really motivating...
 siddharth_	sonney2k, yes I want to do SVM related work...so I am looking into that
@sonney2k	simplesvm maybe http://mloss.org/software/view/26/
 siddharth_	sonney2k, thanks...Also how to report success for installing shogun
 siddharth_	should we provide something or words would do :P
@sonney2k	words do (I hope I don't regret this ;)
