 wangyi160	hi,yo
 wangyi160	anybody here
 wangyi160	I have a question, I am using java interface, where is Load.load_numbers, it is very confusing in the example
 wangyi160	I use DoubleMatrix.loadAsciiFile to replace that, but seems wrong

 n4nd0	blackburn: hi!
 blackburn	hi
 n4nd0	blackburn: I cannot manage to fix a compile error I am getting for the example with the Mahalanobis distance
 blackburn	heh let me try to help
 n4nd0	blackburn: the include directive to the header file MahalanobisDistance.h is working fine
 n4nd0	blackburn: but I still get 'CMahalanobisDistance' was not declared in this scope
 n4nd0	blackburn: and the class is defined in that header
 blackburn	please paste source somewhere
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uVR6
 n4nd0	and the header goes here
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uVS3
 n4nd0	I thought it might be cause by the ifdef HAVE_LAPACK directive
 n4nd0	put the error persisted when I commented it out :S
 n4nd0	but*
 blackburn	ok let me think
 blackburn	n4nd0: does your snippet work with euclidean distance?
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	strange, can't see any error
 blackburn	could you please paste the .cpp as well?
 n4nd0	here it is http://snipt.org/uVV4
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am doubting whether the ifdef HAVE_LAPACK in the .cpp file might be a problem
 blackburn	n4nd0: shouldn't be if you have lapack
 blackburn	it should be here for sure
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 blackburn	hm
 blackburn	n4nd0: chekc interfaces/modular/Distance_includes.i
 blackburn	and interfaces/modular/Distance.i
 blackburn	and add your distance to make it available from modular (python,etc)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have done it now but the error is still there
 n4nd0	but I guess I have to compile shogun first again
 blackburn	no, it won't help with this error
 n4nd0	mmm then it's bad
 blackburn	I currently can't see any reason why it fails :(
 n4nd0	blackburn: you were right, it didn't make the trick to compile :(
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have no idea why can it be wrong
 blackburn	try to use it from python
 blackburn	when things could get clearer
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: you like more python definetely ;P
 blackburn	sure, but I just want to check your distance is being included
 blackburn	btw you will like it too if you don't
 n4nd0	I like it but I have more experience with C++ now
 n4nd0	but I want to improve my python skills
 n4nd0	I'll be back later
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	I'll try to find out error

 wangyi160	hi
 blackburn	wangyi160: hi
 wangyi160	Oh, finally, I found it in the examples/java_modular folder... it seems I should import the whole folder into eclipse..
 wangyi160	why no one answer me... no help, only help myself

 blackburn	hah
* blackburn is curious where is the question :D
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: so the instruction from shogun.Distance import MahalanobisDistance works fine from python
 n4nd0	blackburn: that is at least a good new I guess :)
 blackburn	yeah good news
 n4nd0	blackburn:time to debug then! it looks like my Mahalanobis distance gives always zero as a result :S
 blackburn	haha good distance
 n4nd0	haha eveything is close :P
 n4nd0	blackburn: now that I think of it, is there any way to debug the code written in C++ from a example written in python?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't know if I make my point clear...
 blackburn	well I usually do some debug print
 blackburn	it usually helps, but sometimes C++ example is required..
 n4nd0	blackburn: all right, so just using printf/cout in the C++ code I will get the traces when I execute the example with python?
 blackburn	no, use SG_PRINT
 n4nd0	SG_PRINT("Test message", stdout)?
 blackburn	w/o stdout part
 n4nd0	does it work with printf formatting style?
 n4nd0	SG_PRINT("%d", 5)?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	cool, thank you

 n4nd0	blackburn: another question :P
 blackburn	shoot
 n4nd0	blackburn: so when one is working with just one file within the project doing some debugging, like I am doing right now with this mahalanobis distance
 n4nd0	blackburn: is there any way to just build that part so the modifications can be tested faster?
 blackburn	not really, when you change .h interfaces will recompile
 blackburn	but changing .cpp's will not cause interfaces recompile - would be much faster
 n4nd0	but it is the same process then
 n4nd0	make, make install?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	just try to change only cpp
 blackburn	interfaces won't recompile
 blackburn	it is the slowest step here
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	to run configure also makes the recompilation right?
 n4nd0	I mean that it forces it
 blackburn	yes
-!- delcoder [~ishaan@115.242.104.177] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: man, why can I do RealFeatures(fm) if fm contains just one feature vector?
 n4nd0	ups can't I wanted to say
 blackburn	it should be matrix
 blackburn	I guess numpy treated it as vector
 n4nd0	I will try to make a cast then ... but I am actually loading it using LoadMatrix
 blackburn	numpy tends to do this thing sometimes

 n4nd0	blackburn: I was checking the copy constructor of the class SGVector
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	what's up with it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: shouldn't it copy the contents to another portion of memory?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't think it does that
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	I guess clone is supposed to do that
 n4nd0	yeah I tried with that too
 n4nd0	but clone is actually cloning the T*, not the SGVector structure itself
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 blackburn	I can see it does exactly what you want..
 n4nd0	you mean clone_vector in SGVector?
 n4nd0	maybe there is a method clone I didn't see
 blackburn	yes, clone
 blackburn	not clone_vector
 n4nd0	aha, all right, I didn't see that one
 n4nd0	sorry
 blackburn	no problem :)

 n4nd0	blackburn: fixed :) I am obtaining nice distance values now
 blackburn	nice
 n4nd0	one question about the design
 n4nd0	this Mahalanobis distance looks to be defined both for distance from a point to a distribution and for distance between two distributions
 n4nd0	is it interesting to have both or point to distribution is ok?
 blackburn	I think it should be distance rhs -> lhs pointwise
 blackburn	i.e. lhs should be considered as distribution
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	the function compute receives two indexes as arguments because of inheritance, one of them is not used then
 n4nd0	no problem with that right?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	it is ok I guess
 n4nd0	I found it weird that I can use the code with no problem from python but it was not working before in the C++ example
 blackburn	don't worry we will find out what is wrong with it
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will do a pull request then
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: by the way, should I write sth in author and copyright?
 blackburn	yes, your name :)
 blackburn	I hope it fits into one line ;)
 blackburn	joke :)
 n4nd0	haha it does ;)
 n4nd0	a bit longer than the usual ones, but it does
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	what is J. btw?
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	btw my name has patronymic, so I am Sergey Olegovitch Lisitsyn :) going long as well
 n4nd0	Jos?
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	Fernando Jo?e Iglesias Garc?a
 n4nd0	:P
 blackburn	I heard brazil guys have even more names
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	yeah it might be
 blackburn	I am curious
 blackburn	do you understand portuguese?
 n4nd0	I can understand quite a lot actually
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	but I used to hang out with people from Brazil when I lived in Spain
 blackburn	I used to try to learn portuguese
 blackburn	(failed,yeah)
 n4nd0	oh cool
 blackburn	and no time anymore to do such things haha
 n4nd0	do you manage to understand then "ai se eu te pego"?
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	no, do not understand anything
 blackburn	well soeren has been learning russian for X years
 blackburn	and I have been learning german at school
 n4nd0	and do you manage with German and he with Russian?
 blackburn	and actually we both do not really understand each foreign lang :)
 n4nd0	I think Russian must be really difficult!
 blackburn	I'll took some spanish lessons from you ;)
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	no idea, could be :)
 n4nd0	I am still fighting against Swedish :O
 blackburn	how long have you been in Sweden?
 n4nd0	this is my second year studying here
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	I have been for about 18 months now I think
 blackburn	ah not really long
 n4nd0	I came back to Spain during summer and so on
 blackburn	so you are going back to spain this summer again?
 blackburn	I wonder why you have choosed to study in sweden :)
 n4nd0	the university is really well-known in the university I came from
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	I wanted to go to the nordic countries
 n4nd0	but I was not very sure to which one
 blackburn	not cold enough? :)
 n4nd0	so this university made the final decision
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	we have some cold towns here
 blackburn	;)
 blackburn	I live in not-very-cold-enough one though
 n4nd0	it is fucking cold in winter but the worst thing for me is the sun ...
 blackburn	what's up with the sun?
 n4nd0	one needs almost to pray to see it during winter
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	too few hours of sun for me
 n4nd0	never thought that it would affect me but it actually does
 blackburn	funny, never thought it can affect so hard
 n4nd0	where do you come from in Russia? I have a couple of friends from Moscow and Volgograd living here in Stockhollm
 n4nd0	Stockholm*
 blackburn	I live in Togliatti
 blackburn	and study in Samara
 blackburn	so going back and forth
 blackburn	it is pretty near :)
 n4nd0	good
 blackburn	I'm going to commit some things too soon
 n4nd0	what have you been working on?
 blackburn	generic multiclass things
 n4nd0	haven't heard about them
 n4nd0	what are they in particular?
 blackburn	ah just some classes making possible to use binary classifiers
 blackburn	as multiclas
 blackburn	s
 blackburn	OvR, OvO
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	time to bed
 blackburn	good night
 n4nd0	good night
 n4nd0	and thank you for all your help ;)
