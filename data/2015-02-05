@wiking	mm
@wiking	there was somewhere once a blogpost about shogun + java
@wiking	and even we took it in
 AndreLopes	i need to find that  modshogun.so file
@wiking	for one of our docs
 AndreLopes	Oh..
 AndreLopes	Any ideas?
@wiking	###object oriented java/swig interface:
@wiking	$ mkdir build && cd build $ cmake -DJavaModular=ON .. $ make $ sudo make install
@wiking	to test if it is working try
@wiking	$ export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jblas.jar:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular/shogun.jar:. $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUNDIR/src/shogun:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular $ javac ../examples/udocumented/java_modular/classifier_libsvm_minimal_modular.java $ java classifier_libsvm_minimal_modular
@wiking	shit
@wiking	so
 AndreLopes	The problem happens when running the example
 AndreLopes	it cant  find modshogun.dll or modshogun.so i gu
 AndreLopes	I guess
@wiking	have uhttps://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/INSTALL#object-oriented-javaswig-interface
@wiking	have u checked this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/INSTALL#object-oriented-javaswig-interface
 AndreLopes	yes i have
 AndreLopes	I think its not searching for the libraries at the correct location
 AndreLopes	"In case header files or libraries are not at standard locations one needs to manually adjust the libray/include paths. This can be done with -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/my/include/path (for includes) and -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/library/path"
 AndreLopes	im not sure how to do that
@wiking	mmm wait
@wiking	have u installed shogun?
@wiking	make install?
 AndreLopes	yes
 AndreLopes	the .jar is built
@wiking	is libshogun.so is in /usr/local/lib?
@wiking	or where did it get installed?
@wiking	same for the jar?
@wiking	where is the jar

-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@122.168.108.183] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	I've updated https://mloss.org/software/
 sonne|work	We need somebody to announce this on the mailinglists...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: this guy is really nasty
@lisitsyn	forces me to research the error before merging
@lisitsyn	(guy from swig)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: will* ?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: "wsfulton"
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: do you know what the state of decision trees in shogun is now?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yes that is THE BOSS :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: ask fernando by mail he will tell you more about DTs
@lisitsyn	he avoids irc at job but he will answer quite fast
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: have you read the jmlr paper stating that svms and random forests are most versatile / successfull?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: they said that the R cran random forest package is the best they found so I would want to compare and maybe within this gsoc get this to shogun
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: hmm I think we have RF
@lisitsyn	but comparing it is a thing to do
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well yeah how good are they
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: is parijiat still around?
 sonne|work	the shogun RF guy I mean
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I think no
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: did anyone survive from last gsoc?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I will write him an email nevertheless
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: well lambday but he is with us like for a while
@lisitsyn	my student is really really gone
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yeah lambday is a long time hero :)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: really really??! dead?
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	no I really hope no
@lisitsyn	I mean he even doesn't answer comments in his long standing PRs
@lisitsyn	I guess he is in "fsck this sht" mode :D

 sonne|work	your student
@lambday	sonne|work: lol my student
@lambday	I should really update the NEWS when I do something :D can't see my name much - makes me sad
 sonne|work	lambday: I never do this either... but you really should!
@lambday	sonne|work: you're the boss! the name itself carries your name. you don't need that :D
 sonne|work	lambday: well probably  your are right
 sonne|work	lambday: I wish someone would be doing publicity beside me though :)
@lambday	sonne|work: have you heard of our week-long hackathon plan?
@lambday	heiko was planning that
@lambday	(you were away for a while - that's why asking)
@lisitsyn	guys you will laugh but I have C++ question
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	mac includes AssertMacros at some point
@lisitsyn	and I am like trying to understand when does it include this header
@besser82	lisitsyn, lemme hear you say `What?` =)
@besser82	lisitsyn, where and when does this header go included?
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	can't reproduce that yet
@lisitsyn	outside of shogun
@besser82	mkay...
@lisitsyn	find /usr/include -type f | xargs grep AssertMacros
@lisitsyn	doesn't help
@besser82	From my knowledge that header get's included from stdlibc++  ;)
@besser82	same on Linux / gcc-c++ here
@besser82	always happenes, if you use some function fron stdlibc++ and don't specify "-DNDEBUG" definition during compile time
@besser82	it's not on all srdlib functions, but on some; don't know which trigger that  :(
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@lisitsyn	besser82: lemme try thanks

@besser82	lisitsyn, did work?  :P
@lisitsyn	besser82: not yet
@besser82	lisitsyn, can you paste error, plz?  maybe I have an idea  ;)
@lisitsyn	besser82: I have no error
@lisitsyn	I need to have that error
@lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	lisitsyn, so what's your problem then?
@besser82	:P
@lisitsyn	besser82: I need to proof the swig boss that check is a bad name for function
@lisitsyn	as it is defined in AssertMacros
@besser82	ahh ^^
@lisitsyn	but he believes I included it somewhere in my code so I have to care
@lisitsyn	gosh open source inertia :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, show him stdlibc++-docs  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, that behaviour is documented
@besser82	lisitsyn, AssertMacros get included if `-DNDEBUG` isn't specified amoung $CXXFLAGS
@lisitsyn	I am trying to reproduce that
@lisitsyn	no success yet
@besser82	lisitsyn, documentation might be in stdlibc as well...
@besser82	lisitsyn, since those macros are part of iso-c, possibly ansi-c as well
@lisitsyn	besser82: no they are just apple
@lisitsyn	they renamed it already
@lisitsyn	but back-compat
@besser82	i see
@lisitsyn	why on earth someone named a macro 'check'
@lisitsyn	so much aesthetic very wow

@lisitsyn	besser82: yeah but when does it include this header?
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/swig/swig/pull/324
@besser82	*      By default all macros generate "production code" (i.e non-debug).  If
@besser82	 *      DEBUG_ASSERT_PRODUCTION_CODE is defined to zero or DEBUG is defined to non-zero

@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@lisitsyn	besser82: so -DDEBUG
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes ^^
@lisitsyn	still works :D
@lisitsyn	how to break that stuff
@lisitsyn	c++ -O3 -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp -DDEBUG && ./main
@lisitsyn	main.cpp contains check(PyObject* obj)

@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@lisitsyn	besser82: still compiles
@lisitsyn	something is missed
@besser82	mhhh...
@besser82	lisitsyn, code **must** use Carbon-Framework...  not cocoa
@besser82	lisitsyn, and that's why it will only apply for 32-Bit-Compiled-Code if MacOSX >= 10.6
@lisitsyn	but why happens on shogun?
@besser82	mhhh...  no idea, yet...
@besser82	possibly because of using non-apple stdlibc++?  :P
@lisitsyn	if I include it directly
@lisitsyn	it fails
@lisitsyn	but how to get it included implictly arghargarghargh
@besser82	write c-code  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@besser82	lisitsyn, or include stuff written in c
@besser82	lisitsyn, or build using c-compiler

@lisitsyn	didn't change the game
@besser82	lisitsyn, try to fix it in shogun :P
@lisitsyn	besser82: yeah I give up :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, adding %{#define __ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES 1%} on top of modshogun.i should do it  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, adding %{#define __ASSERT_MACROS_DEFINE_VERSIONS_WITHOUT_UNDERSCORES 0%} on top of modshogun.i should do it  ;)
@besser82	must be zero ^^
@lisitsyn	yeah that's easier
@besser82	my bad
@lisitsyn	than patching swig
@besser82	yes, definitely  :P
@lisitsyn	because this guy will drain my blood until I understand
@lisitsyn	why this damn header is included
@besser82	if that proposal from me doesn't work, the error must be in swig  :P
@besser82	because adding on top of modshogun.i will make sure it's defined, before any shogun-headers are included;  there will be includes from swig code prior to this, only  ^_^
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@lisitsyn	for the sake of humanity renaming check is easier

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix build of modular interfaces with SWIG 3.0.5 on MacOSX
@lisitsyn	lets check
@besser82	lisitsyn, that is what should go into swig as well  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, in a way it will be insinde every swig-generated code at top-most position  ^^
@besser82	lisitsyn, or swig-code needs to be changed at a kazillion different spots  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, with that commit should be able to proof, that it is a problem with Accelerate-Framework
@lisitsyn	besser82: good reason to write in german or latin or portuguese
@lisitsyn	this way you never collide with anything
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, ueberpruefe(PyObject* Gegenstand)   :P
@lisitsyn	looks good
@besser82	lisitsyn, won't collide with any stdlib  ^_^

 sonne|work	AndreLopes: I thought I gave you the solution for that yesterday?! No idea about how to do that in netbeans though
 AndreLopes	I have to add it manually to the classpath
 AndreLopes	idk where the modshogun.so is
 AndreLopes	i need to find that file

 aditya95	Hello, i've been going through the repository for about a week and am finding it quite difficult to wrap my head around all the linkages between files. The notebooks help, but i don't know where to be looking for the issues in the github issue list. Any systematic way you would suggest to get a better feel of how the toolbox works?

 AndreLopes	Guys
 AndreLopes	when shogun does this :
 AndreLopes	DoubleMatrix traindata_real = Load.load_numbers("../data/fm_train_real.dat");
 AndreLopes	  DoubleMatrix testdata_real = Load.load_numbers("../data/fm_test_real.dat");
 AndreLopes	Those files must be.... where exactly?
 AndreLopes	Are they downloadable ?

@sonney2k	AndreLopes, do git submodule update --init in the git root dir
 AndreLopes	im using fedora ...
 AndreLopes	and netbeans im not sure what you mean
@sonney2k	aditya95, did you have a look at the many examples and the doxygen doc?
@sonney2k	that certainly should help
 AndreLopes	qah you mean git control version
 aditya95	sonney2k : no i didnt, should've been more rigorous. thanks!
