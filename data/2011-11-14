 sonne|work	yeah...

 blackburn	sonney2k: sonne|work !
 blackburn	is it working now?
 sonne|work	looks like...
 blackburn	no leaks?
 sonne|work	no idea if the memory leak is back
 blackburn	sonne|work: can you please try valgrind --leak-check=full kernel_custom_modular or so?
-!- blackburn is now known as blackburn|work
 blackburn|work	:D
 sonne|work	please do ...
 sonne|work	I don't have time for that right now
 blackburn|work	I have no shogun available
 blackburn|work	okay
 sonne|work	then grab it :)
 blackburn|work	I'll have to install cygwin, etc
 sonne|work	you know it is open source ;-)
 sonne|work	yeah - but it will work :)
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: I have too bad connection for downloading whole cygwin and shogun :)
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: okay I'll test it this night
 blackburn|work	but it would be bad if it was leaking again
 sonne|work	better than crashing at least
 sonne|work	but my guess is that it isn't leaking
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: leaking = crashing for me :)
 sonne|work	well YMMV
 sonne|work	blackburn|work: did you ever do object detection in images?
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: I'm currently starting to participate in project where we will do that
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: but I have looked through literature already
 sonne|work	so you know HOG features and LBP ?
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: all I know is they exist :D
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: are you doing ~ thing?
 sonne|work	I think this would be a nice application
 sonne|work	all these features are in opencv I guess - so easy to extract
 blackburn|work	ah, for shogun?
 sonne|work	I mean say I would want to track an object
 sonne|work	or detect traffic signs...
 blackburn|work	I thought you are doing it on your job
 blackburn|work	I guess you can't tell me what you do on job haha
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: yes, I will work on traffic signs detection + recognition
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: binding opencv and shogun is quite interesting, I agree
 sonne|work	I mean we just use their features for images ... should be easy
 sonne|work	problem is all the insight about CV
 sonne|work	new field to me
 blackburn|work	for me too
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: btw we (project group) want to find a way to not use HOG due to its time complexity
 blackburn|work	it would be too slow for real-time traffic signs
 sonne|work	doesn't sound so slow
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: right but no way to calculate HOG of the whole image.. same thing with SIFT
 blackburn|work	I do not know much yet

 blackburn|work	I guess the only way is to try almost everything :)
 sonne|work	blackburn|work: I really think computing HOG should be do-able...
-!- supernaught [~hal@host3-196.wifi.ubc.ca] has joined #shogun
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: hmm okay I'll look through it more carefully
 blackburn|work	sonne|work: so are you doing it at job? ;)

 blackburn	sonne|work: how difficult it would be to make shogun compile-able under windozze without cygwin?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can't make shogun on cygwin due to no version_string.h file.. how to avoid this?
 blackburn	why is it working with linux?
 blackburn	whoaa overwhelming warnings
 blackburn	failed
 sonne|work	no idea
 sonne|work	but go to shogun/
 sonne|work	then make lib/versionstring.h
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah did already
 blackburn	but CombinedBlaBlaBla kernel failed to compile
 sonne|work	not here
 sonne|work	what is the error BLABLA?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	okay I'll copy
 blackburn	a lto of errors
 blackburn	sonne|work: what 'not here'?
 blackburn	c++: unrecognized option `-pthread' kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position independent) In file included from kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:11: ../shogun/lib/common.h:48:8: warning: undefining "__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS" kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:19: error: `CCommUlongStringKernel' has not bee n declared kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.cpp:20: error: ISO C++ forbids declaration 
 sonne|work	huh?
 sonne|work	don't you have shogun/kernel/CommUlongStringKernel.h   ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have
 sonne|work	but how come it doesn't know about this class then?
 blackburn	sonne|work: no idea..
 sonne|work	and besides it was working on my windows box
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'll make a try on my notebook's win7
 blackburn	sonne|work: got it
 blackburn	sonne|work: uint64_t is disabled
 sonne|work	err and?
 blackburn	sonne|work: CommULongblabla is derived from StringFeatures<uint64_t>
 sonne|work	and?
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	I got wrong
 blackburn	uint64_t is enabled
 blackburn	then no idea what is wrong
 sonne|work	these uint* enabled/disabled stuff should only affect the interfaces
 sonne|work	not shogun
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	removed it temporary
 sonne|work	which version of g++ is this?
 blackburn	Thread model: posix gcc version 3.4.4 (cygming special, gdc 0.12, using dmd 0.125)
 sonne|work	ok then
 sonne|work	use gcc 4.x!
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	okay
 sonne|work	I am pretty sure gcc 3.x is #*($$UY(!
 blackburn	oh okay
 sonne|work	I am a bit surprised - I thought gcc4* is in latest cygwin for a few years? how come you got gcc3?
 blackburn	sonne|work: checked in gcc
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbL2wWy8KUM
 sonne|work	HOG features in real time...
 blackburn	sonne|work: sure but CUDA on quadro
 sonne|work	yeah sure
 sonne|work	I guess you can easily do the usual cascade/prefiltering
 sonne|work	anyways
 blackburn	I know that there are israeli embedded device with no cuda, etc
 blackburn	making lane detection, etc
 blackburn	oh I really want to test HOG on images
 sonne|work	some other intersting features are ORB features
 sonne|work	similar to SIFT but patent free
 sonne|work	and LBP
 sonne|work	I guess these should be powerful enough to do any kind of detection
 sonne|work	the last slide looks impressive (the avg gradient) http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/voc2006/slides/dalal.pdf
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	sonne|work: nice
 sonne|work	kind of an alien :)
 blackburn	I hope it would work for road signs as well
-!- alesis-novik [~alesis@dhcp-90-089.inf.ed.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn: I mean one could at least try
 blackburn	I should try
 sonne|work	looks like opencv even has some python bindings for these features...
 blackburn	???
 blackburn	???
 blackburn	???
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	 
 sonne|work	dadada
 blackburn	net
 sonne|work	network?
 sonne|work	:P

 blackburn	sind sie mude? ich bin mude!
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	er du mude?
 blackburn	sie = you in plural, right?
 blackburn	Sie = You in singular
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	well sie
 blackburn	sonne|work: is "er du"  correct?
 sonne|work	sie == du
 sonne|work	bist du muede would be the right thing
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	I always laugh on 'gluklich' word
 blackburn	sonne|work: ???? in russian slang is some gallucination :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, so whats up with the leak(tm)
@sonney2k	all good now?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll check soon
 blackburn	just came home
@sonney2k	I am a bit worried about the clang == crash issue
 blackburn	huh 10-50 and I came home
@sonney2k	looks like things are not crashing under debian sid :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll check for leak in a min
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've got access to color FERET database
 blackburn	8.5GB!!!
@sonney2k	is this public?
 blackburn	sonney2k: semi-public I would say - you need to require access
 blackburn	sonney2k: python went smoothly
 blackburn	sonney2k: leak(tm) is gone
@sonney2k	clang's warnings found another round of bugs...
@sonney2k	great!
 blackburn	I'm now off cause I'm deadly hungry but later we would fix some
 CIA-37	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r6c75752 / src/interfaces/ruby_modular/swig_typemaps.i : use strcmp for string comparison in ruby typemaps - http://git.io/RV3F8w
 CIA-37	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r56afbe6 / (2 files in 2 dirs): enable set_shifts in wds examples - http://git.io/qy8iGw
 blackburn	sonney2k: ready for bugfixing
 blackburn	sonney2k: :(
 shogun-buildbot	build #47 of nightly_default is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/47
@sonney2k	blackburn, feel free ... I noticed that sth. is wrong with lua - crashes / memory hog ...
 blackburn	I don't know what are the bugs
 blackburn	lua crashes?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	was it working?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	run make check-examples and you will see - then we have the lib/versionstring.h issue
@sonney2k	then some old tests fail
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you remember if we fixed all tests before we release 1.0.0?
 blackburn	sonney2k: which tests?
@sonney2k	ahh btw you need to do your examples / tests for dimred methods...
@sonney2k	the tests you get when you run make tests
 blackburn	sonney2k: they compare with tests from data, right?
@sonney2k	tests are based on data if you meant that
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you have a few minutes on next week to review my paper on KLTSA?

@sonney2k	I will try my best... but I am not an expert on this subject I am afraid
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is nothing very deep here, just simple trick
 blackburn	I will try to publish it on arxiv
 blackburn	and then cite in paper with chris
@sonney2k	well arxiv is not a journal or anything just some repository
@sonney2k	so it is not counted as a paper... but techreport
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: but recall I'm newbie and my tech report will look like a shit w/o reviewing
 blackburn	sonney2k: so let it call tech report but anyway I would appreciate :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no time/skillz to make truly paper and I don't think this idea worths a paper
@sonney2k	blackburn, go fix your tests
@sonney2k	otherwise we will never be able to release 1.1
 blackburn	phew
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?? ????
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://images.wikia.com/muppet/images/d/d1/Zeliboba.JPG it is you
@sonney2k	I am more like http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/total-war-shogun-2-walkthrough-box-artwork-small.jpg
@sonney2k	anyways time to sleep
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	you are
 blackburn	http://images.wikia.com/muppet/images/d/d1/Zeliboba.JPG
 blackburn	you get me frustrated and not believing I could do anything!
 blackburn	I would better go sleep
