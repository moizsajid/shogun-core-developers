@lisitsyn	lambday: guess what's this
@lisitsyn	We study this graphical model from the perspectives of algebraic statistics and tropical geometry, starting with the observation that its Zariski closure is a Hadamard power of the first secant variety of the Segre variety of projective lines.
@lisitsyn	what's the graphical model they talk about? :D :D

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, whats this linalg patch and is it merged yet? or why not?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what linalg patch?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: there is a load of them
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, not one big piece?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, are things already merged ?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes a bit of them
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: lambday works on that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, excellent
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: its basic linalg operations with eigen and opencl
@lisitsyn	with the same interface
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: iirc the idea is to not employ virtual functions and use templated stuff
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we are half way to have gpu neural nets
@lisitsyn	most things are merged already
 lambday	lisitsyn: sonney2k back
 lambday	sonney2k: yes that's what we are trying to do here - a unified interface for most commonly used linalg operations
 lambday	sonney2k: I've started writing a wiki https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/README_linalg
 lambday	lisitsyn: graphical model!!
 lambday	lisitsyn: no clue :/
 lambday	lisitsyn: Geometry of the restricted Boltzmann machine :P
 lambday	what's this stuff?
 lambday	lisitsyn: did you do any work on submodular optimization?
 lambday	I wrote a feature selection library for linear regression problems https://github.com/lambday/tesseract
 lambday	maybe we can include some of it into shogun as well

@besser82	wiking, no worries ^^  I just ffwd-merged all commits from 'develop' into 'feature/CMake'
@besser82	wiking, there are some minor changes needed for CMake >= 3.1.0, mostly policy-stuff
@besser82	wiking, which are perfectly compatible with older CMake
@besser82	wiking, and I finally wanted to do some polishing on CMake-stuff
@besser82	e.g. add generated PkgConfig-file and possibly some find_package(Shogun)-magic ^^
@wiking	yeey
@sonney2k	besser82, that would be cool...
@lisitsyn	find_package should be easy?

 ephas	Hi, I have come across some strange (counter-intuitive) behaviour.  I am using MKL with the Python interface - I have two kernels, A and B.  When I test them individually, A outperforms B (according to accuracy and AUC), and MKL outperforms each individual kernel.  I then extract the weights using get_subkernel_weights() and am assuming that the returned weights correspond to the order I attach the kernels, e.g. if I attach A and the
 ephas	to A and B.  When looking at the weights, B seems to be getting a higher weighting.  Can this be possible given that A outperforms B?
