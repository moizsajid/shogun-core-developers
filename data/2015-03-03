 miniyou	Hi! I know shogun isn't supposed to be easy in cygwin, but I'm _so close_. During build, when progress is at 100%, the file modshogun.i can't be found: thing is, the path printed is correct except it has backslashes instead of forward slashes. It is relative, I guess cygwin only corrects for it if it's an absolute path. No idea where the backslashes come from, or why the first 99% of the build worked fine. Any ideas?
@lisitsyn	miniyou: could you please paste the error somewhere?
 miniyou	http://pastebin.com/WUh2BR7i
 miniyou	Sorry about cygwin output being in Swedish, I hope it's clear though
@lisitsyn	no problem
