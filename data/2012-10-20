@sonney2k	wiking, blackburn look - I polished the website a bit http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/weblog/shogun
 wiking	sonney2k: heeey!
 wiking	so you are here now?
@sonney2k	I need to sleep now... 5 am here and the gsoc bus is leaving in 3.5 hrs
@sonney2k	cu
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	hahah ok
 wiking	gnite
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, hey
@sonney2k	do you have a minute?
@sonney2k	could you edit http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irc
@sonney2k	and make the irclogs point to the new page (I used beautiful soup again to convert it into our style)
@sonney2k	the new page is http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclogs/
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay
 blackburn	let me recall how to log in :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: it took time to find that crazy german password you gave me :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: done
-!- sonne_ [~sonne@216.239.55.198] has joined #shogun
 sonne_	huuuaaaahh
 blackburn	sonne_: heh
 blackburn	what's that about?
 sonne_	blackburn, I am on my netbook
 sonne_	old hardware old configs :)
 sonne_	blackburn, did you see my attempts of polishing the website
 sonne_	(instead of sleeping)?
 blackburn	sonne_: yeah, I did fixed that link you asked
 sonne_	blackburn, cool
 sonne_	I don't trust to do it over wlan here
 blackburn	irclog page looks nice
 blackburn	a lot of hax0rs
 blackburn	:)
 sonne_	blackburn, I will improve it a bit hopefully
 blackburn	are you at summit?
 sonne_	blackburn, btw it would make sense to move others info also to the contact front page
 sonne_	yes
 sonne_	blackburn, can you do that?
 sonne_	I guess that is the reason we have so few people writing to the mailing list
 blackburn	like heiko and?
 sonne_	we should have that in the very front
 sonne_	ahh yes good idea
 sonne_	you both certainly too!
 blackburn	where to put us?
 blackburn	to 'contact'?
 sonne_	blackburn, at the very bottom
 blackburn	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irc
 sonne_	mailinglist should be encouraged first
 sonne_	then irc
 blackburn	right
 sonne_	blackburn, another thing
 blackburn	I do not understand how to change order :/
 sonne_	I talked with carol smith and I learned that there will be a google documentation sprint in california end of the year
 sonne_	where people can apply and write documentation in just a few days
 sonne_	google covers housing etc
 blackburn	huh!
 sonne_	question is blackburn would you be interested?
 sonne_	and fernando, heiko (who else?) too?
 blackburn	sonne_: so google covers all travel expenses and etc?
 sonne_	we would need at least 4 people I think
 blackburn	sonne_: it sounds pretty interesting
 sonne_	well they cover housing etc - travel one can apply but we will somehow manage (worst case we have to pay it with our gsoc money - though I would prefer to have a shogun mini conference next year with all of you)
 sonne_	blackburn any ideas who else would be interested?
 blackburn	sonne_: well only heiko, me, fernando and wiking are around
 sonne_	I mean we can all help giving input (phd thesises etc)
 sonne_	maybe wiking would be too?
 sonne_	blackburn, maybe we could ask all the other students?
 sonne_	blackburn, could you do that?
 sonne_	wiking, still sleeping?
 blackburn	sonne_: I don't mind - but I have to learn a bit more what is it
 blackburn	so google covers housing and we are all going to the same place
 blackburn	and write doc?
 sonne_	blackburn, yes - you sit at googleplex in some room with heiko and the others and write doc for a few days and google pays hotel etc
 blackburn	sonne_: are you in?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	booooo
 wiking	no i'm not sleeping
 sonne_	blackburn, hard to tell... my gf might kill me
 wiking	sonney2k: here ?:)))
 sonne_	handling kids + work is tough
 sonne_	wiking, would you be interested too?
 wiking	inwhat/
 wiking	sorry i wasn't following
 wiking	just got back
 sonne_	please read the few lines above
 sonne_	 doc sprint
 sonne_	at googleplex
 blackburn	I have to solve 'an army problem' faster :D
 blackburn	sonne_: so it is december?
 wiking	in ca?
 sonne_	blackburn, I am trying to find out...
 sonne_	yes
 sonne_	found the mail
 sonne_	I will forward it to you
 wiking	i mean getting to googleplex (CA) in december is not the cheapest :)
 wiking	but yeah none the less sounds good
 wiking	depends a lot on the dates though
 sonne_	december 3-7
 wiking	mountain view?
 blackburn	omg
 blackburn	I wish I knew about that earlier
 wiking	mm ok the the plane ticket is not sooo horrible as i thought
 wiking	580 for the return
 wiking	sonne_: have shell access atm?
 sonne_	this netbook doesn't even have blackburns email address
 sonne_	*arg*
 blackburn	912 euro for me :D
 sonne_	for heiko about 700 I guess
 blackburn	sonne_: I can't promise anything 'document'-wise
 sonne_	but 4 days hotel is certainly more expensive - but google covered
 sonne_	blackburn, what do you mean?
 blackburn	sonne_: I am not in EU you know
 blackburn	and it would need quite more actions to get me to USA
 sonne_	blackburn, can you fix that problem before?
 blackburn	I have to think about that
 blackburn	sonne_: all the planes are going through london anyway :D
 blackburn	sonne_: in best case it costs 1K$ for me
 blackburn	and takes 35 hours :D
 blackburn	through JFK
 blackburn	sonne_: will I be able to receive invitation to get visa?
 sonne_	that should not be the problem
 blackburn	one can not simply get visa :D
 blackburn	being russian
 wiking	sonne_: can u fire up the buildbot? :)
 sonne_	blackburn, ok you are in principle interested right? wiking you too?
 sonne_	then lets see what the others say
 blackburn	yes I am interested but I have to think and estimate whether I can do that
 wiking	sonne_: pretty much depends what happens with my papers in the next 2-3 weeks
 blackburn	Please note proposals are due by October 26, so get yours in ASAP!
 blackburn	omfg
 wiking	sonne_: and when u have time check this one out: https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/builds/2852182
 sonne_	wiking, but you are in principle interested right?
 wiking	sonne_: in principle yes
 sonne_	wiking, please wait I have to first finish the talk with blackbeard :D
 sonne_	blackburn, regarding the website
 wiking	:>>>
 sonne_	I meant to just copy the page over and remove the other contact subpage
 blackburn	ha
 blackburn	django admin is so classy
 blackburn	sonne_: how can I get visa in less than month?
 blackburn	:D
 sonne_	blackburn, figure it out - no idea
 blackburn	in general it takes month so I am bothered with that
 wiking	blackburn: u can get a 5 days visas
 blackburn	wiking: is that faster?
 wiking	no
 wiking	it'll cost u some for sure
 wiking	:(
 blackburn	what is the advantage then? :D
 wiking	nothing
 wiking	they might not refuse it
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	since u know that u have to pay
 wiking	and they can still refuse to give it to u
 wiking	and then u've lost your money
 wiking	and no visa
 blackburn	pretty nice
 wiking	yeah welcome to the us of fucking a
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	does some invitation or anything makes sense to they?
 sonne_	wiking, alright - so what I wanted to ask is what is the setup of the buildslave?
 wiking	yeah
 sonne_	I mean what commands shall it run
 wiking	blackburn: it does the more the better
 wiking	but still can refuse it
 sonne_	you only gave me the passes
 sonne_	but no more
 wiking	sonne_: ok
 wiking	for configure
 sonne_	wiking, and I also wanted to ask you about unit tests
 wiking	the usua configure line u use when u only build cmd_static
 wiking	and prepend that command with this
 sonne_	wiking, I want to make them *mandatory* e.g. enable them when building and for new code
 sonne_	wiking, please email this
 sonne_	I will need it on the other machine
 sonne_	wiking, that is the reason I couldn't set it up last night
 wiking	scan-build ./configure ...
 wiking	ok
 wiking	just a sec then
 wiking	sonne_: check travis
 wiking	you'll love that for that
 wiking	;)
 sonne_	wiking, buildbot etc is not the issue - we need the integration test to run when one enters make
 sonne_	directly at compile time
 sonne_	otherwise people don't see that things fail
 sonne_	also we have to somehow figure out how to run a full valgind on make check-examples etc
 sonne_	blackburn, this reminds me - whats wrong with the build currently?
 blackburn	sonne_: WIP of heiko
 blackburn	:D
 sonne_	blackburn, did you email heiko?
 blackburn	he started to fix streaming features
 wiking	sonne_: sent
 blackburn	well he knows
 blackburn	he works on that
 sonne_	it is really important that we get it to green asap
 sonne_	otherwise we don't know about the new bugs wiking wants to introduce :D
 sonne_	wiking, thx
 wiking	sonne_: i mean the travis shit is great because it's heavy intergration with github
 wiking	so check this out for example
 wiking	sonne_: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1329
 wiking	sonne_: check the bottom of the PR description
 wiking	sonne_: " Good to merge -- The Travis build passed (Details)"
 wiking	sonne_: so once somebody sends a PR to you
 wiking	travis hooks automatically fire up
 wiking	and try to build the project with that PR
 wiking	and will give you somethign like this: https://travis-ci.org/#!/matplotlib/matplotlib/builds/2676515
 sonne_	wiking, cool!
 wiking	as you can see it built fine
 wiking	so it'll indicate it on the PR page
 sonne_	wiking, where is travis running?
 sonne_	did you set it up?
 wiking	sonne_: cloud
 wiking	sonne_: i have the necessary code for integrating it with shogun
 wiking	i can send in the PR for that
 wiking	the only thing is that only you can set up the hooking
 wiking	between the travis and github (with the account of shogun-toolbox)
 wiking	or with the account which has admin rights over
 sonne_	that is not the issue
 sonne_	I could do this right away
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 wiking	ok
 wiking	shoudl i send the pr then now?
 sonne_	(thanks to google chrome)
 sonne_	sure
 wiking	it's sitting in my master repo
 wiking	ok i'l explain what u need to do
 wiking	in the PR
 wiking	sonne_: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/797
 wiking	sonne_: read before merging
 blackburn	why there are SO MANY DIFFERENT VISAS
 blackburn	crazy state..
 wiking	sonne_: ah yeah that turn on/off thing is on the travis profile page...
 wiking	ah yeah thi sis the pr : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/797
 wiking	;)
 wiking	heheheh travis says it's good to merge ;)))))
 sonne_	wiking, is it sufficient to have shogun src code synced with travis?
 sonne_	or do we need shogun-data etc too?
 wiking	sonne_: it'll do that automatically
 wiking	just add shogun
 wiking	no need for shogun-data
 wiking	it'll recognize that there's a .gitmodules in the repo so it'll clone those as well
 wiking	so i mean just turn on the thing for 'shogun' repo
 sonne_	wiking, that is so F****g uebercool
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	indeed
 sonne_	why didn't you tell us earlier?
 wiking	i still have to fix clang bulding
 sonne_	wiking, could that thing run also valgrind stuff?
 sonne_	I mean we need quite some resources...
 wiking	yes
 wiking	it could
 wiking	the only thing is
 sonne_	yes?
 wiking	that there's a hard deadline
 wiking	for each build instance
 wiking	25 minutes
 wiking	although i saw projects like rails/rails for 51 minutes
 wiking	so i'll still try to push around
 sonne_	wiking, ok
 wiking	let's see the builds
 sonne_	it would likely run all the libshogun integration tests and unit tests even under valgrind
 sonne_	yeah that first
 sonne_	I will get some lunch here now
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	w8
 wiking	you might need to do something
 wiking	first :)))
 sonne_	yes?
 wiking	do this
 sonne_	kissing your ass is out of question
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 sonne_	though I *loooove* this change
 wiking	in there Admin
 sonne_	?
 wiking	on the right
 wiking	Service Hooks
 wiking	i mean on the left
 wiking	do you have it?
 wiking	and the bottom of that page
 sonne_	yeah in there
 wiking	you should see Travis
 sonne_	where is the cia bot btw
 wiking	is it green?
 wiking	if yes
 wiking	then click on it
 sonne_	the bot yes
 wiking	is it ticked out
 sonne_	travis not
 wiking	the 'Active'
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	travis should be
 wiking	is it red?
 sonne_	no user no token - nothing
 sonne_	grey
 wiking	oh shit
 wiking	are u checking it with the right account?
 wiking	i mean github account
 sonne_	sure
 wiking	but i guess u do
 wiking	then go back to https://travis-ci.org/profile
 wiking	and check if shogun-toolbox/shogun
 wiking	is turned on
 sonne_	wiking, ok turned it on again
 sonne_	now it is green
 wiking	ok great
 wiking	so go back to the admin hook page
 wiking	on github
 wiking	and click on the green travis
 wiking	and there force build :)
 wiking	so basically i think something like
 wiking	Update...
 wiking	you have a buttom there
 wiking	you see it?
 wiking	no
 wiking	test hook
 wiking	that should be the name of the button
 sonne_	argh http://cia.vc
 sonne_	maintainer ill
 sonne_	wiking, I pressed test hook
 sonne_	now what?
 wiking	ok
 wiking	now we should see the magic
 sonne_	wiking, where?
 wiking	https://travis-ci.org/#!/sonney2k/shogun
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	it seems the hook is not attached to the shogun-toolbox account
 wiking	but there it goes
 wiking	it's started
 shogun-buildbot	build #455 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/455  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>, Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	sonne_: it's not the right repo :(
 sonne_	wiking, ahh I see
 sonne_	hmmhh now idea how to switch profiles
 wiking	:>>
 wiking	yeah you'll have to figure that one out :)
 wiking	as this repo build will fail
 wiking	since it doesn't have the .travis.yml file
 wiking	so it doesn't really know what to do with the repo other than checking it out
 wiking	btw i've just found out about travis when i've seen this article
 wiking	sonne_: you'll like it imho: http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/
 wiking	amazing patch :D
 wiking	btw
 wiking	i think github is really having issues lately: 129 KiB/s when cloning :)))
 wiking	blackburn: http://researchinprogress.tumblr.com/post/33946389387/we-regret-to-inform-you-that-you-paper-has-not-been
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	wiking: that's me with the ice cream
 blackburn	but I like professor pic most
 wiking	:>>>
 blackburn	okay my research completed - it seems to be possible to get visa and foreign passport in month
 blackburn	but pretty hard
 sonne_	wiking, alright now it shoudl work
 sonne_	but where do I see it?
 wiking	sonne_: https://travis-ci.org/
 wiking	ctrl-f shogun
 wiking	https://travis-ci.org/#!/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 wiking	there you go
 wiking	!!!
 wiking	hurraaaay
* sonne_ is starving
 wiking	sonne_: go have lunch
 wiking	thnx a lot for setting up
 wiking	let's discuss the rest later
 wiking	about the testing etc
 wiking	because with this thing now we can really do some nice funky things
 wiking	i.e. forcing in a PR that it build with travis
 wiking	and in travis we force to run unit testing
 wiking	etc
 sonne_	wiking, yeah but you could already get gmock etc stuff to work on configure as a starter
 wiking	;)
 sonne_	yeah
 sonne_	alright
* sonne_ off for food
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll start that

 wiking	btw it's fucking lol
 wiking	blackburn: check out the difference between clang vs gcc
 blackburn	where?
 wiking	https://travis-ci.org/#!/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/2869073
 wiking	in a minute clang will finish

 wiking	heheh
 wiking	15 vs 17
 wiking	yey niiice

 wiking	actually in the meanwhile with the other changes it seems the clang error has been fixed

 blackburn	merged
 wiking	goodie :)
 blackburn	travis is pretty cool
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but seems now they are having a bit of a problem with bandwidth
 wiking	yesterday it was much faster... the clone
 wiking	oh lool
 wiking	i wonder why does it do this as well

 wiking	so it builds the merge of the PR as well
