 tomv_	hello. I am trying to compile shogun 2.0 for Debian (using the 1.x packages as base). Unfortunately, the python-modular seems to have problems with string.h vs. cstring. Have you seen (and possibly resolved) this?
 blackburn	tomv_: hey
 blackburn	tomv_: could you please paste the error?
 tomv_	In file included from modshogun_wrap.cxx:9562:
 tomv_	/usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.7/../../../../include/c++/4.7/cstring:101:3: error: declaration conflicts with target of using declaration already in scope
 tomv_	  memchr(void* __s, int __c, size_t __n)
 tomv_	and some more of the same variety.
 tomv_	this is with clang
 tomv_	clang++ -g -fPIC -O0 -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=shogun -DSHOGUN -DLINUX -DUSE_BOOL -DUSE_CHAR -DUSE_UINT8 -DUSE_UINT16 -DUSE_INT32 -DUSE_INT64 -DUSE_UINT64 -DUSE_FLOAT32 -DUSE_FLOAT64 -DHAVE_POWL -DHAVE_LGAMMAL -DHAVE_SQRTL -DHAVE_LOG2 -DHAVE_PTHREAD -DHAVE_HDF5 -DHAVE_JSON -DHAVE_XML -DHAVE_ATLAS -DHAVE_LAPACK -DHAVE_SUPERLU -DHAVE_ARPACK -DUSE_GLPK -DUSE_LZO -DUSE_SNAPPY -DUSE_GZIP -DUSE_BZIP2 -DUSE_LZMA -DHAVE_LARGEFILE -DUSE_SHORTREAL_KERNELCACHE -DUSE

 tomv_	(sorry for the flooding)
 blackburn	tomv_: I've never seen such error to be honest.. but let me try to help you somehow
 tomv_	well, I have seen somewhere that clang has stopped using std:: or somesuch.
 tomv_	I think it might be that you can only include ctring and string.h in a certain order or something.
 blackburn	tomv_: okay I think we can find some solution
 blackburn	tomv_: could you please remove line 71 in src/interfaces/python_modular/protocols_helper.i?
 blackburn	then try to recompile - should work
 tomv_	doesn't look good.
 blackburn	tomv_: still? bad bad
 tomv_	but something went wrong with regenerating the .cxx from .i, I'll check this some more an be back in a minute.
 blackburn	tomv_: what is the error now?
 blackburn	if it doesn't help could you also try to replace that line with #include <string.h>?
 blackburn	i am not sure about that but it doesn't happen to reproduce on my machine so I'd need you help there
 tomv_	blackburn: thanks! the problem just now was that the debian packaging copied around the .i and so it always took the copy of the old version. I am sure that the error will either be resolved or different now.
 blackburn	tomv_: nice
 tomv_	I'll let you know which once I know. :)
 blackburn	tomv_: sure - I am going to get some sleep in 15-30 mins though but just paste it here I'll read that later (or post on the mailing list)
 tomv_	ok.
 tomv_	I'll probably not try too long, but report tomorrow. good night and thanks!
 tomv_	now I 'make clean'ed too good and it recompiles shogun, so it'll be tomorrow. good night!
