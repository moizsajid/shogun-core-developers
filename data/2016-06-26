@wiking	Saurabh7__: y0
 Saurabh7__	wiking: yo
 Saurabh7__	sry having bfast :)
@wiking	Saurabh7__: ok so i replied in the PR
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	but we should discuss things about the trees
@wiking	as there are some stuff that needs to be fixed there
@wiking	(see those static analytics errors as well)
@wiking	lemme know when it's a good time for you
 Saurabh7__	brb 5 min
@wiking	k
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@x5ce58487.dyn.telefonica.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 Saurabh7__	wiking: there ?
 Saurabh7__	so you mean the feature type itself
 Saurabh7__	current implementation assumes some feature might be nominal , some continous
 Saurabh7__	i.e feature1 is nominal, feature2 is continous
 Saurabh7__	wiking: so you think we should allow stringfeatures and convert them internally ?
@wiking	convert?
@wiking	what do you mean?
@wiking	i mean the thing is that trees should work
@wiking	out of box on values like hot, cold etc
@wiking	right?
 Saurabh7__	yes thats right
@wiking	ok so that's wha ti mean by
@wiking	we shoudl support string features out of box
@wiking	in case of trees
@wiking	we shoudl not require anybody to encode them as floats or something
@wiking	since trees usually should be able to handle string features
@wiking	i mean the ohter thing is
@wiking	CombinedFeatures
@wiking	shoudl be supported by trees
@wiking	which could consist of StringFeatures and DenseFeatures
@wiking	and i've added some errors that are detected by static analysis of the code
@wiking	that should be fixed as well
@wiking	but more importantly
@wiking	in trees we should totally fix this error
@wiking	that we only support dense features
 Saurabh7__	ok , combined features look good, we already know the underling types
@wiking	yep
 Saurabh7__	rather than the current way of passing a bool vector
@wiking	but currenlty we cannot support string features
@wiking	right?
 Saurabh7__	no
@wiking	ok so that should be priority here
@wiking	to add support for that
@wiking	as it's a bit nonesense
@wiking	i mean it's great these speedup improvements
@wiking	but then again this is a fundamental thing
@wiking	:)
 Saurabh7__	yes
@wiking	i mean you dont have to do this within this pr
@wiking	lets have those static analysis errors fixed in CARTree
@wiking	but then i really reckon the next step should be fixing this in CART
@wiking	(and in all other trees)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1159 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test test_1 notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/1159  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Sanuj <sanuj.sharma.in@gmail.com>, Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, OXPHOS <engelzora@gmail.com>

@wiking	Saurabh7__: still here?
 Saurabh7__	wiking: yes
@wiking	ok so another question
@wiking	shouldn't we actually make the RandomForest if not templateable
@wiking	but at least to set the tree implementation
@wiking	have like CART as a default tree
@wiking	but have the option to use different tree implementation
 Saurabh7__	ah so different trees
@wiking	yeah because you could use
@wiking	C4.5
 Saurabh7__	yes that could be
@wiking	or C5.0 for a random forest
@wiking	or chaid for that matter
@wiking	i mean the BaggingMachine is flexible
@wiking	it can do bagging with *any* machine
@wiking	now RandomForest should be a bagging machine with for all trees
@wiking	maybe have a default tree it would use
@wiking	but then again the user should be able to override this easily
@wiking	imo
@wiking	since there are sometimes cases when other trees are more appropriate
 Saurabh7__	that makes sense, can be done by setting machien parameters differently
 Saurabh7__	for random forest depending on the tree
@wiking	yep

@HeikoS	Saurabh7__:
@HeikoS	sanuj:
 sanuj	HeikoS, hallo
 sanuj	i was not able to solve the any.h destructor bug
@HeikoS	sanuj: did you debug it?
 sanuj	yes, i did that
@HeikoS	so our question was: why is it called, from where
 sanuj	need to share a link
@HeikoS	kk
 sanuj	HeikoS, when this happens https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-9c3599c0d2090e493be261b079e9b63eR39
 sanuj	this is called https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8ea96286d95b52029d31636117e0fe55R140
 sanuj	and i think the destructor was called from here
@HeikoS	this is because the old one is overwritten?
 sanuj	not sure, but how is it overwritten?
@HeikoS	sanuj: map[tag]
@HeikoS	might contain another any
@HeikoS	sanuj: so we have to solve this
 sanuj	map[tag] should be empty right
@HeikoS	sanuj: yeah it should
 sanuj	it is the first time something is set
@HeikoS	why would the destructor then be called?
@HeikoS	is the assignment operator maybe doing it?
 sanuj	HeikoS, shall i share the logs of ddd with you?
@HeikoS	causing it
@HeikoS	sanuj: we have two options
@HeikoS	you figure it out, or I have a look
@HeikoS	I prefer you doing it :D
@HeikoS	but for that, you need to dig a bit
 sanuj	HeikoS, setting was working fine before i made these changes....destructor was not being called before
@HeikoS	sanuj: these changes as in?
 sanuj	let me call ddd again, i did this yesterday so forgotten some stuff
@HeikoS	what are "these changes"
 sanuj	HeikoS, new protected set and calling set in init_params() with member variables
-!- oxphos [c68f0c0c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.198.143.12.12] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	sanuj: I see
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok then, I suggest:
@HeikoS	sanuj:  you (partly) revert them for bug hunting
@HeikoS	make it like this
@HeikoS	sanuj: or actually, one more question
 oxphos	@HeikoS hey I'm on my cellphone
@HeikoS	so registering *member* variables inside a class worked before you made "these changes"?
@HeikoS	oxphos: I see, hi! :)
@HeikoS	oxphos: no worries then, just wanted to discuss a bit
@HeikoS	oxphos: but no point on cellphone
 sanuj	HeikoS, i was never registering member variables before
@HeikoS	sanuj: why did you say that it worked then?
 sanuj	and there is one more thing that worries me
 sanuj	HeikoS, it was able to set random parameters
 sanuj	before
@HeikoS	sanuj: we need to be a bit more systematic if we want to solve this
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	sanuj: so let's do this then: make a backup of the changes you did
@HeikoS	then revert them
@HeikoS	then try to register a member variable
@HeikoS	I am pretty sure you will get the same error
@HeikoS	but we need to check
 sanuj	okay, i also think so
@HeikoS	and then finding it, we are not distracted by your latest changes
 sanuj	let me do it
@HeikoS	sanuj: we need to reduce the search space of potential error here
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	too many things at once and it is not clear what causes what
@HeikoS	this statemeht "it worked before these changes", is neither checked nor true at this moment
@HeikoS	so careful when thinking about things
@HeikoS	need to really be sure whats going on
 sanuj	HeikoS, sure sure
@HeikoS	if one convolutes things in ones mind, then finding errors becomes very hard
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	right now we are not sure whether it is your update or a general problem that causes this member registering error
@HeikoS	or maybe even the framework is not designed for registering member variables?
 oxphos	HeikoS okay will revise the schedule in 6h and will be back to laptop client tmr
@HeikoS	not clerar
@HeikoS	oxphos: cool! perfect
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool then, Ill see you later, lets keep going on this, try to think about what good next steps could be, dont stop if there is a problem
@HeikoS	finally, if nothing else works, you can push everything to a local feature branch in your own shogun fork
@HeikoS	sanuj: and then I can clone that and debug locally
@HeikoS	good?

 BZDMG	sanuj:
 BZDMG	what's the bug you're talking about
 sanuj	BZDMG!!!
 sanuj	BZDMG, https://gist.github.com/sanuj/695d881295c060d5fbb99abd3552fcbb
 sanuj	see error_2.txt
 sanuj	BZDMG, it happens when _set is called in init_params() of MockObject
 BZDMG	ok where is the actual one
 BZDMG	MockObject?
 sanuj	apparently Any destructor is called and deletes the member variable
 sanuj	sending link
 sanuj	BZDMG, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-4a319646835bd87fa05b41d8b1872184R22
 BZDMG	you didn't call CSGObject ctor
 BZDMG	in the MockObject ctor
 BZDMG	I think the map is not really initialized
 sanuj	so in this commit i have added a protected _set() in SGObject
 sanuj	i undid this commit on my local
 sanuj	and did the same thing with the old public set() in SGObject
 sanuj	that seems to be working without SGObject ctor
 BZDMG	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-4a319646835bd87fa05b41d8b1872184R9
 BZDMG	you should call it anyway
 sanuj	okay
 BZDMG	I am not sure I understand what you did
 BZDMG	what commit? :)
 sanuj	BZDMG, this commit https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/commits/380f576e3615aea29b56f0afb721efe5485510ae?diff=unified
 BZDMG	ehrr that's too many changes
 BZDMG	did ctor help?
 sanuj	wait let me switch branches and build it
 sanuj	BZDMG, it's building, will take time
 BZDMG	okie
 sanuj	BZDMG, how's work?
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 BZDMG	sanuj: bit busy as you can see haha
 sanuj	:D
 BZDMG	starting some project soon
 sanuj	okay
 BZDMG	will be better soon
 sanuj	BZDMG, do you read deepmind's papers?
 BZDMG	nope
 BZDMG	why?
 sanuj	just asking
 BZDMG	they are doing some atari reinforcement learning :)
 sanuj	you are interested in deep learning
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	but some recent work is different
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@x5ce58487.dyn.telefonica.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 sanuj	things like
 sanuj	neural turing machine (2014)
 sanuj	neural programmer-interpreters
 sanuj	and memory augmented nn
 sanuj	are cool
 sanuj	BZDMG, shogun doesn't have RNNs and LSTMs
 BZDMG	yeap
 BZDMG	actually I am not a fan of that synthetic stuff like neural turing machine
 sanuj	BZDMG, were you ever talking about using tensorflow in shogun?
 sanuj	haha
 BZDMG	yeah I thought of that
 BZDMG	but heiko said optimizer is in python
 BZDMG	so we can't really do anything useful just from C++
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	BZDMG, still segfaults
 BZDMG	sanuj: is it the same error?
 sanuj	BZDMG, yes
 BZDMG	sanuj: I am pretty sure something is not initialized
 BZDMG	you should probably check it with gdb
 sanuj	i did that
 sanuj	gives you lots of stuff
 sanuj	i used ddd
 BZDMG	sanuj: well may be you can print `self` in init_params
 BZDMG	are you sure you've added base class ctor call and recompiled it?
 sanuj	BZDMG, i did this
 sanuj	CMockObject() : CSGObject()
 sanuj	    {
 sanuj	        init_params();
 sanuj	    }
 BZDMG	looks valid
 BZDMG	it should not work w/o
 BZDMG	or work by chance
 BZDMG	which is not any better
 sanuj	BZDMG, did you see protected _set that i added in SGObject?
 BZDMG	yeah but I am a bit lost in _set set and _set
 sanuj	i think protected _set() might be calling itself instead of private _set()
 BZDMG	oh my god
 BZDMG	are they of the same name ?
 BZDMG	private and protected?
 sanuj	yes :/
 BZDMG	please dont do this :D
 BZDMG	better call it kawabanga
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	i'll call this add
 BZDMG	call it set_init
 BZDMG	add
 BZDMG	whatever
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i thought it would differentiate with arguments
 sanuj	let me see if this is causing the error
 BZDMG	even if it does it is way too dangerous
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	building will take time again
 sanuj	BZDMG, btw is "add" fine or shall i call it something else?
 BZDMG	add is fine to me
 sanuj	BZDMG, if this is going to be the problem then i might bang my head on the wall :P
 BZDMG	lol
 sanuj	BZDMG, does it happen to you that you made some really silly mistake and spent lots of time debugging it ? :D
 BZDMG	yeah
