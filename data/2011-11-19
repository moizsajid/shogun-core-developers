 Lina	Hi
 blackburn	hi
 blackburn	Lina: guess who
 Lina	hi
 Lina	i downloaded and compiled everything from blank
 blackburn	Lina: and it still is not working?
 Lina	blackburn: no
 blackburn	bad bad
 blackburn	".depend"?
 Lina	yes, same error
 Lina	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `.depend', needed by `libshogun.so.11.0'.  Stop.
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	let me check again
 blackburn	Lina: did you download it with git?
 blackburn	i.e. not as archive but git clone?
 Lina	no, i downloaded it directly from https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/downloads
 blackburn	Lina: could you please git clone it?
 Lina	yes, i will try
 blackburn	Lina: it could help us to find out which commit caused your error
 Lina	ok, that seems to work
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@49.249.160.24] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 Lina	it is compiling
 blackburn	Lina: hmm I don't know the cause but let it go away at least for now
 Lina	thanks
 blackburn	if you have time (I have) we could discuss how to fix your issue
 Lina	sure
 blackburn	Lina: could you please try to run your script without System.gc and check memory usage with top
 blackburn	?
 Lina	yes, if the compilation is done, i will test it
 Lina	i'll let you know
 blackburn	heh yes
 blackburn	it is pretty slow
 Lina	yes
 blackburn	Lina: btw you can use --disable-optimization to speed up your compilation
 blackburn	in configure
 blackburn	Lina: how soon you need to get these results?
 blackburn	I can help you with rewriting it into more stable python or even C++
 blackburn	don't afraid python it is easy :)
 Lina	thanks :-)
 blackburn	so what should I do?
 blackburn	although my real work is heavily engaged with java ee I really don't like it :D
 Lina	i need the results soon, since i am collaborating with somone
 Lina	haha
 blackburn	and java interface is result of this gsoc
 blackburn	we have some issues already so it is pretty fresh
 Lina	if there are still memory leaks when running the script, then i have no other choice..
 blackburn	Lina: it would be really better to use python, you will like it
 Lina	:-)
 blackburn	oh it doesn't looks like I'm talking about python if we remove 'python'
 blackburn	Lina: pros is you don't have to loadlibrary, set paths, etc
 blackburn	Lina: did it compile already?
 Lina	yes, but i have to do the confgure again and set "prefix" since i am not able to do make install otherwise
 Lina	i have no root access on this computer
 blackburn	Lina: oh don't you use your notebook now?
 Lina	no
 blackburn	Lina: ok
 blackburn	Lina: what is os on that machine?
 shogun-buildbot	build #52 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/52
 blackburn	surprise haha
 blackburn	oh did I broke kernelpca
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@49.249.160.250] has joined #shogun
 Lina	Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64
 blackburn	Lina: and distrib?
 Lina	Debian 2.6.32-35squeeze2
 blackburn	okay
 Lina	sorry, setting the prefix in ./configure does not help either
 Lina	when i make install, i get install: cannot remove `//usr/local/lib/R/site-library/sg/libs/sg.so': Permission denied
 blackburn	Lina: hmm do you configure it with R?
 Lina	--interfaces=cmdline_static,python_static,r_static,python_modular,ruby_modular,java_modular
 Lina	yes
 Lina	so, i try it without R
 blackburn	Lina: why? do you need all of them?
 blackburn	it takes \infty time to compile all of them :)
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.240.27] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 Lina	no, there was no reason for it ;-) in case i need another module...
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.240.27] has joined #shogun
 Lina	ok, done
 Lina	i am running the script now
 blackburn	Lina: hooray :)
 Lina	:-)
 blackburn	Lina: what is memory usage?
 Lina	2.3g
 Lina	but it keeps increasing
 blackburn	Lina: oh
 blackburn	Lina: do you have valgrind on that machine?
 Lina	yes, seems to be installed
 blackburn	examples/undocumented/libshogun/
 blackburn	make
 blackburn	valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=log.log ./mkl_memleak_test
 Lina	hmm,  c++ -O3 -g -I/usr/include  basic_minimal.cpp   -lshogun -L/usr/lib  -o basic_minimal basic_minimal.cpp:1:30: error: shogun/base/init.h: No such file or directory basic_minimal.cpp:3: error: 'shogun' is not a namespace-name basic_minimal.cpp:3: error: expected namespace-name before ';' token basic_minimal.cpp: In function 'int main(int, char**)': basic_minimal.cpp:7: error: 'init_shogun' was not declared in this sc
 Lina	when doing make
 blackburn	ohhh
 blackburn	where is shogun installed?
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.240.27] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 Lina	in my home directory
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.240.27] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	damn
 Lina	?
 blackburn	Lina: pidgin is buggy :)
 Lina	i see :-)
 blackburn	Lina: you need to specify paths I guess
 Lina	which ones?
 blackburn	LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 blackburn	Lina: is shogun headers in /usr/include?
 Lina	no
 blackburn	Lina: where is it?
 blackburn	then change it in examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile
 blackburn	line 2 or so
 Lina	ok
 Lina	compiling..
 blackburn	nice!
 Lina	hm, it seems like valgrind is not installed; /usr/lib/valgrind and /usr/lib64/valgrind only contain the file python.supp
 blackburn	:(
 blackburn	Lina: so you can't do valgrind?
 Lina	no
 blackburn	Lina: bad.. okay should I rewrite your example into python?
 blackburn	or do you want try it more? :)
 Lina	i am not sure if it makes sense to try it more
 Lina	what do you think?
 blackburn	Lina: it would be at least faster
 blackburn	Lina: what if I send it tomorrow?
 Lina	to write it in python you mean?
 blackburn	Lina: yes
 blackburn	I guess it should take less than hour
 blackburn	Lina: deal? :)
