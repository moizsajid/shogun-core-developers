 blackburn	sonney2k: here?
@sonney2k	there
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	sonney2k: give me a little advice: in which type should I return ROC?
@sonney2k	blackburn, auROC or the curve?
 blackburn	curve
 blackburn	float64_t* get_ROC()
 blackburn	or
 blackburn	float64_t* get_ROC(int32_t& len)
 blackburn	or
 blackburn	get_ROC(float64_t* ar, int32_t& len)
 blackburn	or some other way
 blackburn	which is looking better for you?
@sonney2k	blackburn, as 2d matrix... so just void get_ROC(float64_t** roc, int32_t* rows, int32_t* cols)
 blackburn	is it necessary to return rows? it's always 2
@sonney2k	(or safe one * and use ref's -> & )
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	okay, thank you
@sonney2k	thank you!
 blackburn	for? ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: evaluate() for auROC, right?
@sonney2k	yes
 dvevre	sonney2k: changed the parser code somewhat yesterday, will make the changes in the StreamingFeatures today
 dvevre	did you see the commit?
@sonney2k	dvevre, yes - can't wait to see the streamingfeatures change :)
@bettyboo	yeah
-!- akhil_ [75d35896@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.88.150] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 dvevre	it'll be done by tonight, hopefully..
 blackburn	sonney2k: you said ROC in PerfMeasures is 'more' right
 blackburn	it seems don't
@sonney2k	blackburn, great - then there is a bug.
 blackburn	looks like it will fail in case of equal outputs too
 blackburn	not fail, but will skip some column in matrix
 blackburn	the probability of equal outputs is pretty damn small though :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, no it is not...
 blackburn	it not? hm
 blackburn	well so it is more important than I thought
 blackburn	sonney2k: is 'int32_t fp=0, tp=0, i, length;' a bad style?
@sonney2k	sonney2k, yes, I don't like that - can be confusing to read
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	have to finish work on ROC tomorrow, study took away all my time :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: you have so dense discussion in 'streaming features' pull request
 blackburn	wow, ~1.6K lines
 alesis-novik	Good evening
* blackburn is staring on word 'evening' and yawning
 alesis-novik	For me it's early afternoon
 blackburn	;)
 blackburn	alesis-novik, sonney2k, dobroy nochi
 blackburn	good night everyone
 blackburn	see you
@sonney2k	he
@sonney2k	cu
@sonney2k	I will go to bed too
@sonney2k	btw added the planet
 alesis-novik	Night
@sonney2k	I mean rss stuff

@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/planet/
@sonney2k	so now I am waiting for your blog / feeds
@sonney2k	ahh and the bts trac too
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, I won't have too much time these next few weeks because of exams, so I won't be coding as much
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/trac
@sonney2k	noted
 dvevre	trac isn't as active as it should be
@sonney2k	dvevre, well just set up right
@sonney2k	it used to be a spam sink
 dvevre	sonney2k: yeah.. i saw some interesting stuff on it earlier ;)
@sonney2k	now hopefully better - but only useful for long term planning / difficult to trac down bugs
-!- sploving [~sploving@124.16.139.196] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	dvevre, it was totally impossible to file a bug in previous trac
@sonney2k	it was taking any report as spam
@sonney2k	(as there were 99.99% spams only)
-!- sploving_1 [~sploving@124.16.139.196] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
 dvevre	sonney2k: so the new setup is spam-resistant?
@sonney2k	dvevre, it is using akismet
@sonney2k	so much better probably
@sonney2k	anyway - l8r
@sonney2k	need sleep
 dvevre	bye
 alesis-novik	Night
