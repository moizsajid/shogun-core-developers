@sukey	New Comment on Pull Request "Hey @Saurabh7 sorry for being annoying again but just a minor comment. Isn't it possible to use the `SGMatrix<float64_t> result` matrix from here itself and then use an Eigen map for it for operations that follow? If operator `=` does a deep copy for Eigen (required in the expression `map_result = (map_l.transpose()*map_r).template cast<double>();`, then we're good, right? Saves an extra alloc and copy. Can you please check
@sukey	doable?" by lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3427#discussion_r87139393

@sukey	New Comment on Pull Request "Hey @Saurabh7 ! Sorry again for being a PITA (I should have commented on this before) but doesn't `map_result = map_result.array().sqrt();` create a temporary matrix and then do a deep copy? In that case, would it be possible to have an in-place operation for element-wise sqrt for the `result` SGMatrix? Maybe use our `linalg` methods?" by lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3427#discussion_r87143361

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, trump will be president. So not for long and you will have no issues to come to the states :=)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: absolutely
 lisitsyn	hahah
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, might be that you have to wear a putin mask
@sonney2k	and ride a whale or horse or sth
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: the greatest victory of russian foreign politics  :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, absolutely
@sonney2k	I am thinking of changing my profile picture to look like a certain blond guy ;P
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, is putin also more popular among woman?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: not sure
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, maybe he didn't find the right words...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: well he is like 85-90%
 lisitsyn	it doesn't matter who are these 10%
@sonney2k	looks like trump is superior after all in finding the words attracting woman
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah grab them
@sonney2k	grab them by..
 lisitsyn	that's what you do
@sonney2k	yeah maybe irrelevant then
@sonney2k	the world just needs the best teachers it can get
 lisitsyn	heh
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I certainly need to learn horse riding, submarine diving,...
@sonney2k	what else did he do?
@sonney2k	the brain we leave to trump
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: grab some amphora
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: fly su-27 or mig-29
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, easy. doing that freediving down to 50m
 lisitsyn	a lot of things
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, don't we have something more advanced like flying autopiloted space ships?
 lisitsyn	not yet!
@sonney2k	or google autonomous cars w/o a steering wheel and causing an accident
@sonney2k	man I need challenges!
@sonney2k	real ones
@sonney2k	those migs are too easy too steer anywyas
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: well try to manipulate us elections
 lisitsyn	he managed to
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	ok I kind of admit this is an advanced subject
@sonney2k	how many machine learners where involved on either side?
@sonney2k	did he hack clinton's NN?
@sonney2k	adversial learning?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: she has good old svm
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw at NIPS this year?
 lisitsyn	poison attack
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: for sure!
 lisitsyn	you?
@sonney2k	no. sold out
@sonney2k	and too late
 lisitsyn	meh
 lisitsyn	I registered early for this very reason
@sonney2k	didn't expect that nor was I ready for it mind wise
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I observe kinda shitstorm in twitter
 lisitsyn	:D

 sonne|work	HeikoS: where do we put the old demos?
 sonne|work	(on the website I mean)
@HeikoS	sonne|work: nowhere
@HeikoS	they are broken
 sonne|work	and how do we get all the examples converted?
@HeikoS	suggestions?
 sonne|work	wiking showed my one and it was working..
@HeikoS	example converting happens by gsoc students mostly
@HeikoS	and by us hopefully
@HeikoS	we still have the python examples
@HeikoS	I want to put a link somewhere for the meantime
@HeikoS	good point in fact
@HeikoS	ill do that today
 sonne|work	http://demos.shogun-toolbox.org/regression/svr/
 sonne|work	that stuff is still nice..
@HeikoS	oh yeah
@HeikoS	I agree
@HeikoS	should put it back
@HeikoS	problem is maintainance
@HeikoS	I tried a few a while ago
@HeikoS	and all were broken
 sonne|work	yes but they still work..
@HeikoS	which is worse than not having any online
@HeikoS	you got an idea how to check whether they work?
 sonne|work	maybe we need to add a test for them then
 sonne|work	yeah separate the in this case svr regression call
 sonne|work	and just call it in some test
@HeikoS	I guess yes
 sonne|work	with dummy data
 sonne|work	shouldn't be hard
@HeikoS	yeah cool, will check that out
@HeikoS	we want to put a link back in the showroom
 sonne|work	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/contributions is broken
 sonne|work	(the link in) See our list of integrated external libraries.
@HeikoS	is that linked from anywhere?
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	thanks!
@HeikoS	can you file an issue on the web2 repo?
@HeikoS	ah now
@HeikoS	its in main repo
@HeikoS	the page is now in wiki
@HeikoS	I will fix
 sonne|work	yeah I fiddled with it yesterday
 sonne|work	notebooks have a title now
 sonne|work	and api lists the full class list
@HeikoS	ah cool!
@HeikoS	nice one!
@HeikoS	didnt see yet
@HeikoS	thats really good
@HeikoS	for examples
@HeikoS	there is two components of a cookbook page
@HeikoS	1.) code listing
@HeikoS	2.) markdown page
@HeikoS	what takes time to write is 2
@HeikoS	what is important internally is 1 (since testing=)
@HeikoS	so I was thinking of just putting the plain listing if not markdown page exists
@HeikoS	and have a list in the examples page "all"
@HeikoS	sonne|work: btw you realise that now
@HeikoS	we have integration testing across all modular targets?
@HeikoS	they are all compared against the cpp output
 sonne|work	sry off for food
@HeikoS	enjoy!
 Saurabh7	gp demos still working :)
 Saurabh7	need some tests
@wiking	wooooooooooooooooho
@wiking	we won :>
@wiking	:PPPPPPPPPPPP
@wiking	ok i was just joking ....
@wiking	sonne|work, here?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
@wiking	ok jsut sent u an emai
@wiking	l
 sonne|work	wiking: then years later after the NSA and various spam filters did proper spell checking ... it will eventually arrive
@wiking	:>
 sonne|work	HeikoS: but cool stuff regarding the integration tests
@HeikoS	sonne|work: yeah now we can really claim that we are multi interface since we know we get the same thing
 sonne|work	yeah that is outstanding...
@HeikoS	now we need to port examples
@HeikoS	as I said
@HeikoS	not need to write the fancy markdown pages in the cookbook
@HeikoS	but just copy pasting the examples
@HeikoS	very easy from python
@HeikoS	and that extends test coverage big time
 sonne|work	don't really understand how...
@HeikoS	what how?
@HeikoS	how to port?
@HeikoS	or why it extends test cov?
@HeikoS	for testing, tell in some sense it doesnt as results should be covered by unit tests and most typemaps are already tested with the existing examples
@HeikoS	but still, it is good to explicitly know that everything gives same result
 sonne|work	yes how to port examples
 sonne|work	I mean there is just this small set now..
 sonne|work	this and the demos and a fully working website would be nice at least..

@HeikoS	wiking: second is this parameter stuff
@HeikoS	wiking: I think before we think about how we do this, we need some discussion on our motivation there
@HeikoS	wiking: because we are entering probabilistic programming language land with this
@HeikoS	and the question is whether this is useful for us
@HeikoS	or whether some simpler things might be sufficient
@HeikoS	I currently can think of two advantages that parameter domains would have for us
@HeikoS	1.) setting paramters has automatic checks .... pretty minor
@HeikoS	1a. model selection might be a bit easier compared to these model selection trees.
@HeikoS	2.)
@HeikoS	automatic change of parametrisation under the hood
@HeikoS	this is really useful when gradients are computed
@HeikoS	i.e. any optimization or sampling algo
@HeikoS	the thing I realised yesterday:
@HeikoS	Shogun is more a collection of hard-coded efficient algos
@HeikoS	point 2.) only is useful if we have a way to define models in shogun
@HeikoS	and then want to optimize them (like a probab. prog. lang)
@HeikoS	the GP stuff could be a use case here
@HeikoS	but generally, I have doubts
@HeikoS	we dont do this at many places
@wiking	but allowing it
@wiking	wouldn't hurt no
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	no i agree
@HeikoS	 but its a massive undertaking
@HeikoS	whereas point 1 is simple
@wiking	yeah but that's like
@wiking	version 6.0.0
@wiking	or 7.0.0.
@wiking	i mean this is just simple discussion
@wiking	we should not limit ourselves
@wiking	to easy stuff
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	I mean if we want to move shogun more towards a modern architechture where all models are defined in a non c++-code way, and inference/optimization be automatic, then it makes sense to do that
@HeikoS	but do we want to?
@HeikoS	And closely related: is that feasible?
@HeikoS	since it would require to rewrite almost all algorithms
@wiking	yes
@wiking	:)
@wiking	and if worst case not
@HeikoS	we cant just use libsvm anymore
@HeikoS	and currently, only GP would benefit
@HeikoS	so I just challenge whether that is a good idea
@wiking	yeah but we could chagne things right?
@HeikoS	there is tensorflow, gpflow, etc
@wiking	i mean i fucking hate libsvm
@wiking	for the fact
@HeikoS	these libraries explicitly do that kind of stuff
@wiking	that there's *Everything* hardcoded
@wiking	not even a simple linalg thing can be plugged in or out
@HeikoS	I know
@HeikoS	Well Shogun is like that
@HeikoS	if we want to change, that's essentially a re-write
@HeikoS	I am happy to discuss that
@HeikoS	but
@HeikoS	just wanted to point that out
@wiking	yep
@wiking	but now we have bigger issues
@wiking	so lets this discussion run
@HeikoS	yeah as well
@wiking	dont kill it just yet
@wiking	see where it leasds
@HeikoS	nono
@wiking	*leads
@HeikoS	I mean I discuss it at this moment right? :)
@wiking	ue yep
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	i dont get it
@wiking	why this only fails in osx
@HeikoS	wiking: man this PR ;)
@wiking	"In fact I just realised all notebooks will have broken links.

@wiking	what?

@HeikoS	wiking: ok lets see what else did I want to bring up
@HeikoS	Shall we announce release on mailing list?
@HeikoS	and everywhere?
@HeikoS	or rather wait to 5.1?
@HeikoS	with all the GSoC stuff in it?
@HeikoS	wiking: I was thinking of getting into that linalg merge next
@HeikoS	wiking: other suggestions?
@HeikoS	wiking: btw there are more broken links in that intro notebook

@wiking	like
@wiking	can you copy the LINK
@wiking	not where it is
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CStringFeatures.html
@HeikoS	this one we had
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CBinaryLabels.html
@HeikoS	this one works now
@HeikoS	(notebook renders it wrong)
@HeikoS	wiking: btw
@HeikoS	wiking: do you have ideas on
@wiking	okok
@wiking	this is the same story
@wiking	i have a fix for it
@HeikoS	how to unify cookbook and doxygen
@HeikoS	would be cool not to write everything twice
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ^
@wiking	HeikoS, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web2/commit/30d109eea00686df858c033652d68c485da2b354
@wiking	this will be deployed in a minute
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@HeikoS	wiking: so we have the information in cookbook: high-level desription, math, papers
@HeikoS	and in doxygen we also have: API details, like "this method does this, overload it blabla", that is more c++ related
@HeikoS	So I wonder
@HeikoS	whether we can re-use
@HeikoS	and this way, cookbook polishing also polishes API docs
@HeikoS	at least parts of it
@wiking	re-use what way
@wiking	be less high level
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	1sec
@HeikoS	http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/examples/binary_classifier/kernel_svm.html
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/api/latest/classshogun_1_1CSVM.html
@HeikoS	redundant!
@HeikoS	double maintenance, double polishing, double writing
@HeikoS	Could the cookbook re-use parts of doxygen
@HeikoS	@brief
@HeikoS	http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/examples/regression/random_forest_regression.html
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/api/latest/classshogun_1_1CRandomForest.html
@HeikoS	http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/examples/multiclass_classifier/random_forest.html
@HeikoS	does it make sense, or shall we just stick with current approach?
@HeikoS	better decide (and potentially change) that soon, before it becomes impossible
@wiking	btw
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.h#L201-L202
@wiking	why reference of the matriceis?
@HeikoS	I dont know what you mean
