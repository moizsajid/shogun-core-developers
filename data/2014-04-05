 thoralf	Hey.
 kislay	thoralf, hi :)
 thoralf	kislay: Good morning!
 thoralf	Different time zone I guess. ;)
 kislay	thoralf, good afternoon from here :D
 thoralf	Yeah. :D
 kislay	thoralf, you belong from Europe, aren't you?
 thoralf	Yes, Germany.
 thoralf	UTC+2
 thoralf	(summer time since last sunday, rest of the year UTC+1)
 kislay	thoralf, never knew that even time zones are this complicated :)
 thoralf	kislay: How is your project going?
 kislay	thoralf, I am working on few issues.
 thoralf	Any problems there?
 kislay	thoralf, I have done quite a bit of documentation part, for eg: a ipython notebook and django demo stuff. But I want to dive in some C++ code. Any pointers please?
 kislay	thoralf, how should I start?
 thoralf	kislay: I guess it's best to look into one of the examples (libshogun/undocumented directory)... there are many, so you can choose which part of shogun you want to understand.
 thoralf	First you should understand SG_REF/SG_UNREF, because we have this magic thing which cleans references automatically.
 thoralf	Turn on debugging and watch out for "SGRefObject created/destroyed" messages.
 kislay	thoralf, in the examples you mean..
 thoralf	While executing one of the examples, yes.
 thoralf	So you see when objects are destroyed and created.  This is a bit tricky -- it will save you some pain understanding it first. ;)
 kislay	thoralf, got it.
 kislay	thoralf, Do you think a taking up a issue will speed up things?

 thoralf	What also helps is to setup an own project directory, where you can create your own test-c++ programs.  Though changing the examples in shogun would also be possible, it will require you to always recompile more stuff.
-!- prams [~pratheekm@122.167.192.188] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	This is annoying because waiting 2 minutes after fixing a simple issue is not acceptable. ;)
 thoralf	kislay: Let me check if there are issues related to this.
 kislay	thoralf, yup . Thanks for the info. It will be a good headstart :)
 thoralf	kislay: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2054 <-- An issue I created.  It's more about documentation, but also involves what I said: Setting up a separate project outside shogun sources.
 kislay	thoralf, yeahh :)
 thoralf	kislay: Who are you on github?
 kislay	thoralf, kislay is kislayabhi on github :D
 kislay	thoralf, okay. I went through the details you provided there on the issue tracker.
 thoralf	kislay: I see two open pull requests.  What's missing to close them?
 kislay	thoralf, Is one related to some PCA notebook. I think it got polluted.
 thoralf	Okay, can you close the polluted one?  So we have only have active PRs on the TODO list.
 kislay	thoralf, sorry. I did it just now.
 thoralf	No worries. :)
 kislay	thoralf, which other one are you seeing?
 thoralf	Just some housekeeping. ;)
 thoralf	https://github.com/kislayabhi <-- click "period: 1 month" next to on "contribution activity", then you should see your recent PRs.
 kislay	thoralf, any specific example that you want me to work on related issue.
 thoralf	Talking abbout #2054?
 kislay	thoralf, yup.
 thoralf	The binary example is totally fine.
 thoralf	If it's too easy, we can pimp it afterwards. ;)
 thoralf	Or do you have other examples in mind?  What's your interest?
 kislay	thoralf, hehe, PCA for sure!!
 thoralf	You can even do something with GPs or PCA.
 kislay	thoralf, First I need to get a hang of the issue!
 thoralf	The thing is, that this one should explain how to solve one more-less common problem with shogun.  It wouldn't make sense to have many hundred lines of code, because this should end up in an example.
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@host210-17-dynamic.49-79-r.retail.telecomitalia.it] has quit [Quit: PirosB3]
 thoralf	sorry,  not example.  tutorial
 kislay	thoralf, yup. correct me if my understanding is wrong: You want a tutorial for new users to deal with different ways a shogun method/class can be used.
-!- newlido [~quassel@193.227.20.2] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	kislay: Yes.  Imagine a new user asks: "I have a C++ program and I want to use shogun to train a whatever-classifier on own data?"
 thoralf	Or PCA or or or ;)
 kislay	thoralf, then that user is in trouble!!
 thoralf	lol
 kislay	thoralf, I must help them.
 thoralf	In which case ;)
 kislay	kislay, hmm.. I am getting the gist of your point!
 thoralf	kislay: Talking to yourself? ;)
 kislay	thoralf, haha :D
 kislay	thoralf, As a new user, I need to ask myself a lot. This helps a great deal to produce lucid code!!
 thoralf	Yes.
 thoralf	Just something "how would a shogun developer do this", so you have something clean to start from.
 thoralf	And then dive into the details *after* having compiled something.
 thoralf	Not debugging weeks until you get something compiled. :)
 thoralf	kislay: My suggestion for the tutorial would be github MD files.  Then we can convert them to html and include it on the website quite easy.
 kislay	thoralf, got it. Er.. which compilation you are talking about?
 thoralf	Well, assume that the user already compiled shogun and installed it somewhere.
 thoralf	Let's say the headers are in /home/user/shogun/includes while the library is in /home/user/shogun/lib/libshogun.so.16.1
 kislay	thoralf: so, the user needs to use them
 thoralf	I don't understand?
 kislay	thoralf, sorry again. What you meant by this "And then dive into the details *after* having compiled something."
 thoralf	I meant, it's easier for the user to dive into the details if he has something running.
 kislay	kislay, okay okay.
 kislay	thoralf, okay
 kislay	got ir
 kislay	it*
 kislay	thoralf, Now I have a clear picture. :)
