 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Small script to produce html for the markdown files in the repo
 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Update gitignore to ignore notebooks and the html-from-markdown files
 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Fernando Iglesias :master * f27e933 / pages/views.py,shogun/urls.py,templates/markdown.html: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web/commit/f27e93350e1fd7a5204342789db041590a8a657b
 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Create new markdown template and update views and urls to show the html
 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: files rendered from markdown

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Store markdown transformed to HTML inside templates instead of static.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Include html in markdown template instead of reading in the view.

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: Instead of retrieving md files from their url, look for them recursively given a root directory.

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, what do I need to run now exactly?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, python util/markdown.py will generate the markdown files
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, that will work right away if the machine where it is run has the Shogun repo in the directory pointed by SRC_DIR in shogun-web's shogun.settings
@iglesiasg	otherwise, just do python util/markdown.py <root dir to Shogun>
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no module named github
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, forgot to commit it?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, nope, it needs to be installed
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, which package?
@iglesiasg	pip install github should work I think
@iglesiasg	let me recheck
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sorry
@iglesiasg	pip install PyGitHub
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, please write that down somewhere
@sonney2k	we will forget...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sure, one second
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, please also commit SRC_DIR='/home/shogun/modshogun/shogun' for production case
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, it ran through
@sonney2k	with one error
@sonney2k	Decoding ERROR. Could not render to HTML LICENSE_SVMlight.md.
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so where can we find the page now?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I got that error too. I am not sure what is wrong with that one. But probably we don't want/need to put it live in the website in HTML anyway
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, what is the url to see the pages?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, try for instance http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/README
@iglesiasg	check the PR for some others
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok fine except that the links dont' work
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/README_developer.md
@iglesiasg	without md
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well just click on README
@sonney2k	and then the readme_developer
@sonney2k	the link is wrong inside
@iglesiasg	aaah all right
@iglesiasg	those ones do not work true
@iglesiasg	mmm how can we fix that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, keep the .md suffix?
@iglesiasg	I guess so
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, once these minor things are fixed
@sonney2k	next step would be to replace redundant website content with the stuff we have - not clear how exactly but it is better to just maintain one place...
@iglesiasg	indeed
@sonney2k	hmmhh these READMEs are kind of a mix of overview and documentation
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	bed time for me
@sonney2k	cu
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and thanks for your work!!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, my pleasure!
@iglesiasg	good night!

 clueless	Ubuntu 12.04, the link libshogun.so.15 exists in /usr/local/lib/ alongside libshogun.so.0 and the link libshogun.so.
