@sonney2k	blackburn, good news - we will have another 3 build slaves at tu for osx / windows / linux :)
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	how soon?
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	few week(s) I guess
 blackburn	bad
@sonney2k	blackburn, no no - that's actually great!
 blackburn	but it would be after our release
 blackburn	sonney2k: so is TU any interested of shogun?
@sonney2k	blackburn, everything will be after our release now
 blackburn	what is the everything?
@sonney2k	all new features / hardware / support whatever
@sonney2k	blackburn, I expect many questions on the mailinglist once the new version is out
 blackburn	we probably should post changes on the ml
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have a changes mailinglist
 blackburn	?!
@sonney2k	blackburn, shogun-commits@shogun-toolbox.org
 blackburn	commits?
 blackburn	btw how many subscribers are there?
@sonney2k	whenever one commits sth then it is posted to this list
@sonney2k	(I always keep track via this)
@sonney2k	one could add build failures too btw :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, shogun list or commits?
 blackburn	shogun list
@sonney2k	192
 blackburn	huh I thought >500
@sonney2k	no there where never that many
 blackburn	*parse error*
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you suggest any other important feature of genomic data?
 blackburn	except GC content
@sonney2k	in tss there is TAAAT or TATA or variants of this sth like 30bp before the tss
* blackburn 's brain exploded

 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb378001 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/structure_dynprog_modular.py :
 CIA-87	shogun: add scipy compatibility wrapper for mat_struct
 CIA-87	shogun: this should fix the python_modular dynprog example on newer scipy's - http://git.io/QvNw2g
@sonney2k	blackburn, you did a *great* job in reducing all these warnings
@sonney2k	big kudos for that!
 blackburn	sonney2k: it was pretty simple in compare to writing a full doc haha
@sonney2k	blackburn, all green so far http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/waterfall :)
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm still thinking about integration of dim reduction things and heiko's stuff
 blackburn	and I don't like that there is no out-of-sample extensions for lle/mds/etc
 blackburn	I simply can't come up with idea how to do that
 blackburn	i.e. init can't return/modify given features but where to store embedding..?
 shogun-buildbot	build #89 of python_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/python_modular/builds/89
@sonney2k	yay!

@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not sure how to do it best either
 blackburn	me too
 blackburn	and I fell myself like marvin today (again)
@sonney2k	blackburn, you better create a new branch and implement something you have fun with
@sonney2k	blackburn, getting close to a release is usually painful
@sonney2k	this one is the most painful every though - just extremely many changes
@sonney2k	and I would have wished that we had all the infrastructure before GSoC
@sonney2k	now with trac/git/buildbot/irc and mailinglists all up, it would be much more simple
 blackburn	I don't know what to do now
@sonney2k	blackburn, fix java examples
 blackburn	ah yes
@sonney2k	some crash / don't run
@sonney2k	seems like ruby works nicely
@sonney2k	I couldn't figure out how to install csharp stuff
@sonney2k	and where to
 blackburn	absolutely no idea
@sonney2k	that is the last interface missing to be included for real...
 blackburn	all the students have gone :D
@sonney2k	Yeah I guess that's life - though having you in the team is a very positive exception
@sonney2k	and who knows I think heiko and f-x will occasionally contribute
@sonney2k	blackburn, for me now the most important thing is a new webpage structure
@sonney2k	like make doc needs to properly create a documentation
 blackburn	yeah current webpage sucks
@sonney2k	and install it to the webpage
@sonney2k	blackburn, how about /doc - for the most current doc
 blackburn	double sucks
@sonney2k	and then /doc/<shogun_version> for the older ones?
@sonney2k	blackburn, double?
@sonney2k	webpage you mean
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	everything sucks :D
 blackburn	webpage is non informative
 blackburn	doc is outdated
 blackburn	yeah idea about moving doc is good
@sonney2k	blackburn, how about you design a new webpage layout?
@sonney2k	(after you've done the java example fixes)
 blackburn	I'm too lame to do this well :(
@sonney2k	we could use jquery to have screenshot/slidshow on the front page
 blackburn	well I could but it would take much time
@sonney2k	blackburn, well then find some inspiration somewhere and tell me
@sonney2k	no it is easy
@sonney2k	I programmed my homepage within 1 day or so
 blackburn	easy but I don't like web and aren't familiar with any beautiful web
@sonney2k	(w/o content - the django based framework behind)
 blackburn	jquery/blabla things
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but you can search for a site that you like (layout wise) and show me
 blackburn	ah okay
@sonney2k	then we can inherit the good ideas
 blackburn	good site is really important
 blackburn	sonney2k: are shortreal distance matrices any needed?
@sonney2k	well they are memory efficient - so why not keep them?
 blackburn	I'm currently refactoring cdistance
 blackburn	okay I'll copypaste it
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need to remove SG_PROGRESS things from cdistance, is it ok?
@sonney2k	blackburn, or use templates...
 blackburn	I can't check SG_PROGRESS in parallel threads..
@sonney2k	blackburn, well you could for the thread that runs in the main thing
@sonney2k	anyway need to sleep now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
