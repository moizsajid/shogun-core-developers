@sonney2k	please improve it
 wiking	will try
 wiking	just trying to finish up a paper here
 wiking	:)))
@sonney2k	good luck
@sonney2k	n4nd0, fern4ndo really did a great job... he wrote a quite flexible system
 blackburn	sonney2k: bern4rd :D
@sonney2k	alright have to change notebooks
@sonney2k	bern4ard
@sonney2k	lack of sleep....
 blackburn	bernardo :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can I send email from that email?
 wiking	blackburn: the from field in a mail you can put anything ;)
 blackburn	well yeah with some hacks
 blackburn	but normally?
 wiking	no hacks

 blackburn	Y one could ever use email programs in 2012
 blackburn	:D

 sonne_	hmmhh I think we should use d3js / mathjax for our html documentation...
 sonne_	err website
 sonne_	not the real doc
 wiking	true
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I got the mail

 ptizoom	hello
 ptizoom	to all the sonne*
 ptizoom	ptizoom is still around and somewhat try to discover the art of machine learning...
 ptizoom	I try to match the best LR parser (with shift, reduce,goto) to some counts of occurrence strings_b "is just after" string_a...
 ptizoom	and construct, thereof, with such bi-gram likely set of terminal tokens...
 ptizoom	I am sure shogun will come into play ... somewhere?

 blackburn	wiking: I've got a clearcase work again!
 blackburn	n4nd0: I have one idea
 blackburn	not sure whether it is not crazy, probably it is
 blackburn	can we develop a structured model that fits skeleton of a human body?
 blackburn	from say multiple cameras, I have such data around
 wiking	yes
 wiking	u could do that
 n4nd0	blackburn: it sounds fancy
 n4nd0	are you thinking of something like pose tracking?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	well one pic should be enough
 blackburn	but I do not like to cheat so lets try to develop it
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think pose tracking is a bit challenging so as to be ready for Friday :O
 blackburn	n4nd0: we have 'true' data
 blackburn	I think it is possible to fit it to train data
 blackburn	n4nd0: sonney2k: I've discussed with guys who have been to USA, they say it is impossible to get a visa in my 'situation'
 n4nd0	blackburn: :(, your situation = the time span you have?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	more specifically no foreign passport yet which takes a few weeks
 n4nd0	that's bad
 n4nd0	do you know if you can get something temporary?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	probably not
 wiking	mmmm either the dot product in eigen has something going on
 wiking	or i dont know
 blackburn	eigen's dot product is ok I think :)
 blackburn	we use it in all linear models IIRC

 wiking	hahha
 wiking	how is this possible
 wiking	same input
 wiking	different output
 wiking	with mosek
 wiking	:)
 wiking	it optimizes differently
 wiking	but the whole thing is exactly the same :D

 blackburn	wiking: A MIRACLE - I found out how to find a commit I wanted to find in clearcase :D
 blackburn	holy day
@sonney2k	blackburn, try it anyway
 blackburn	sonney2k: about visa?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yup
@sonney2k	I asked a bit further
 blackburn	I ordered a foreign passport, once I get it we will see if there is enough time
@sonney2k	usually up to 30 organizations apply
@sonney2k	about 5 are accepted
 blackburn	ahhhh
@sonney2k	(similar ratio as gsoc)
 blackburn	so we have no chance
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	well we have but not the big chance
@sonney2k	and notifications will be sent out within 1 week
 blackburn	1 week?!
@sonney2k	so it is looking quite good
 blackburn	ahh within
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I thought 1 week *before*
 blackburn	sonney2k: so do we have 4 shoguneers?
@sonney2k	blackburn, wiking, n4nd0, heiko
 blackburn	heiko is out with NIPS
@sonney2k	blackburn, is that decided already?
 blackburn	I am very probably out with no visa
 blackburn	sonney2k: about heiko? well he will be visiting NIPS
@sonney2k	blackburn, when did he say that?
 blackburn	hmm am I wrong?
@sonney2k	<heiko1> well, then us three at least
@sonney2k	that is the last thing I heard from him
@sonney2k	(that was before n4nd0)
 blackburn	hhmm okay
 blackburn	anyone else?
 blackburn	sonney2k: does chris want?
@sonney2k	seems not
@sonney2k	maybe me but not too likely
 blackburn	I am unable to say anything before middle of november
@sonney2k	doesn't matter
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	well we apply assuming that everything works out - if not well bad luck. we cannot do anything about it
 blackburn	ah okay

@sonney2k	ptizoom, do you understand why v_array doesn't work with perl?
@sonney2k	(I don't get it)
@sonney2k	ptizoom, ahh I understand. it clashes with parse_label ( a perl function)

@sonney2k	ptizoom, I managed to get perl / pdl include path etc autodetection for configure working
@sonney2k	so what is left to do now is typemaps typemaps typemaps

 ptizoom	hio
 ptizoom	sonney2k: donot mind you give your patch for the config...in effect your git dev branch ... !
 ptizoom	also you have 2 ways of getting typemaps... make it pure perl, or use it through pdl.
 ptizoom	and remind kindly , I have only done (still buggy!) dense string/vector/matrix conversions.
 ptizoom	remains... sparse stuff, and general dims arrays. IO FILE* and CODE callback have not been thought through.
 ptizoom	also the little bits for "warn" and "print" callbacks through threads... I cannot understand Perl_IO yet!
-!- naywhayare [~ryan@spoon.lugatgt.org] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 ptizoom	and I thought reusing PDL is more attractive than pure perl...it is like adding salt and sugar together.

 wiking	blackburn:
 wiking	0.00000303491
 wiking	this is considered a big error or?
 blackburn	wiking: ehm error of?
 wiking	well this is the difference
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@122.174.101.163] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 wiking	between my code and the reference code
 wiking	supposedly the same dot product
 wiking	of the a sparse vector
 blackburn	hmm
 wiking	abs(dot(v,v)-dot(v',v'))
 blackburn	depends on scale of vectors..
 blackburn	are they L2=1?
 blackburn	arh
 blackburn	they are not
 blackburn	what is abs(dot(v,v)-dot(v',v'))/dot(v,v)?
 wiking	7.8062538e-10
 blackburn	pretty small relative error then
 wiking	well all in all this accumulates
 wiking	to a quite bit of an error on the learning part
 wiking	:(
 wiking	but then i guess there's not much i can do about it at this point ...
 wiking	:)
-!- naywhayare [~ryan@spoon.lugatgt.org] has joined #shogun
 wiking	ahahahah
 wiking	LOLFACE!
 wiking	float -> double error :D
 blackburn	ha
 blackburn	I thought about that
 blackburn	floats sucks
 wiking	this really fucked me up a whole fucking day
 wiking	or even a 1.5 :(
 wiking	ok i should test this new sosvm solver
 wiking	with other data :P
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	SLEP guys get upset with me because of lost citation :D
 blackburn	I hope they will accept my sorry
 blackburn	sonney2k: seen mail?
 wiking	O-SVM: 89.80
 wiking	BMRM:   88.60
 wiking	CC:   90.30
 wiking	MC:     40.50
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	sweet
 blackburn	wiking: what is the data and what is going on?

 wiking	blackburn: i've just added that new so classifier to so_multiclass.cpp
 wiking	to see if it at all works
 wiking	now i'm trying to recover svmlight
 wiking	so that this new solver can work with svmlight as well
 wiking	not only with msoek
 wiking	*mosek
 wiking	i need an optimizer that solves this
 wiking	min 0.5 w*w + C sum_i C_i \xi_i s.t. x_i * w > rhs_i - \xi_i
