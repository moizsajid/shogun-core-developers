 blackburn	HELLO
-!- yoh_ [~yoh@washoe.dartmouth.edu] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: around?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: at skype with Nico :)
 blackburn	oh any news on SO improvements?
 blackburn	does he have any cool ideas?
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: yoh
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have been asking here about the bundle methods
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have the ideas more clear now :)
 blackburn	what about subtracting <w,Psi(x,y_truth)> in argmax?
 n4nd0	yeah we talked about that
 n4nd0	he said that the score in the ResultSet (the return value of argmax) can be defined as we like
 n4nd0	so yes, we can make that the score is
 n4nd0	score = <w,Psi(xi,y)> + Delta(yi, y) - <w,Psi(xi,yi)>
 n4nd0	that way in the generic risk we'll just do
 n4nd0	call to argmax
 n4nd0	and
 n4nd0	risk += ret->score
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you like it like that?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes that's ok
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	n4nd0: but we need to not forget about subtracting loss from multiclass model
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, sure
 blackburn	however this is kind of inefficient it is more general this way
 blackburn	n4nd0: what about HM SVM?
 blackburn	is it correct now with provided risk function?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	the only thing is that now (in the PR I submitted) the loss is taken into account twice
 n4nd0	but I'll fix that within minutes now
 n4nd0	nicococo: anything to add? :)

 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you think?
-!- nicococo [~nico@guest0.ml.tu-berlin.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
 n4nd0	does it sound good?
 blackburn	n4nd0: about what?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	about having this working well finally
 n4nd0	supported by Nico, it gives more confidence that it is ok
 blackburn	well yeah I don't mind to make it work :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: can you please also document in argmax description
 blackburn	that in training mode it computes blablah
 blackburn	with blahblah assumption
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	I will add director SO model
 blackburn	once we have everything working
 blackburn	this would be really kind of killer feature I hope
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah the SO director is very interesting
 n4nd0	I told gsomix about it
 n4nd0	blackburn: SO model and StateModel is very interesting too!
 blackburn	well it is pretty easy to set up, not really needed any gsomix's expertise :)
 blackburn	director StateModel?
 n4nd0	I would welcome StateModel very very much
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	it is HM right?
 n4nd0	you know when you use the HM-SVM you need another piece
 blackburn	so i.e. if you have 3 states
 blackburn	you would need that
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	apart from the number of states, the type of model too
 blackburn	okay lets implement that too
 blackburn	ah llike semi markovian?
 n4nd0	e.g. in speech recognition people used right Markov models
 n4nd0	the transitions to the left (think of a Markov chain of states) are not allowed
 blackburn	I think about starting PGM course *seriously* this time
 n4nd0	yeah me too
 n4nd0	end of September
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: well I don't care about that competitive stuff
 blackburn	lections are here anyway
 blackburn	err lectures
 n4nd0	true
 blackburn	and you always can submit code
 n4nd0	we should try to take to it and motivate each other not to drop it
 blackburn	motivation should come from research interest
 n4nd0	that one seems so far away...
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 n4nd0	I see research something sooo far
 blackburn	no it is already here in front of you
 blackburn	staring into your eyes :)
 n4nd0	haha we shall see
 n4nd0	the compilation time in my computer kills me
 n4nd0	it makes me lose time for real
 blackburn	--disable-optimization, multiple threads?
 blackburn	ccache?
 blackburn	are you using that
 blackburn	or are you talking about interfaces?
 n4nd0	I use ccache make -j2 normally
 n4nd0	disable-optimization on
 n4nd0	normally just with python-modular support
 blackburn	well what can I suggest is to use libshogun only
 blackburn	or lets try to find a way to split interface file
 blackburn	n4nd0: hah were you here already then we disabled optimizations in interfaces?
 blackburn	before it took 2-3 times more
 n4nd0	I don't think so
 n4nd0	really?
 blackburn	we are now using -O0 in interfaces
 blackburn	but before it was global
 blackburn	-O3 or -O0
 blackburn	for everything
 n4nd0	can imagine
 blackburn	n4nd0: but in general I agree we really need to improve dev experience
 blackburn	n4nd0: what mostly slows down compilation is template classes
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	n4nd0: one of reasons I felt a little pain in my bottom when you introduced matrix features :D
 n4nd0	it could be so cool if it is just re-compiled what is changed
 n4nd0	when one changes a header file, all over again
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	they were required I think, didn't find anything that could do the job
 n4nd0	though I looked for it!
 blackburn	yes, dense wouldn't work
 blackburn	okay dense subset is not really needed we could merge it to dense
 blackburn	argh no pluskid around
 blackburn	okay I have to add a unit test then
 n4nd0	blackburn: PR updated
 blackburn	okay let me check

@sonney2k	yoh_, I think you can safely assume that debian wheezy will have shogun from squeeze
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@178.45.65.87] has joined #shogun
 yoh_	sonney2k: 0.9.3? how ? atm there is no single version in wheezy and only viable one to enter is in unstable/sid which is 1.1.0...   or do you mean that wheezy will not have any version? ;)
 yoh_	btw -- probably for my own sake I will just build backports of 1.1.0 and distribute from neuro.debian.net
 blackburn	yoh_: why not 2.0?
 yoh_	blackburn: is it released? well tested? is there a debian package? ;)
 blackburn	yoh_: is that done for 1.1.0? :D
 blackburn	2.0 will be released on 1st of sept
 yoh_	blackburn: 1.1.0 was out there for a while so hopefully it is a bit more tested ;)
 blackburn	yoh_: no it is not
 blackburn	I am sure 2.0 have less bugs than 1.1.0
 yoh_	blackburn: it would be great! ;)  so, ok -- is 1.1.0 worth hassle over 0.9.3?
 blackburn	yes, sure
 blackburn	but 2.0 is worth even more :)
 blackburn	not feature-wise but bug-wise
 blackburn	there were a few bugs that has to be merged 1.1.0 if it was supported
 blackburn	to 1.1.0*
 blackburn	yoh_: 0.9.3 has no java, no ruby.. etc
 blackburn	yoh_: two major (I do mean major) new features are director swig stuff and structured output framework
 yoh_	good ;-) FWIW: myself I care about python  ;)
 blackburn	yoh_: then directors are for you probably
 blackburn	and zero-copy features
 blackburn	yoh_: directors allow you to take care of e.g. kernels computing using python code
 blackburn	or to define structured model via python code
 blackburn	(in case you didn't know what it is) :)
 yoh_	so, 1st of sept there also would be debian packages uploaded? ;)
 blackburn	yoh_: I am just a stupid developer, let you rather ask soeren about that :)
 yoh_	sonney2k: btw -- from the debian build log it is not clear -- are you running unit/regresion tests at pkg build time?  it might be cool if you did ;-)
 blackburn	to be serious I am unsure about that - sonney2k takes care about that
 blackburn	yoh_: can I see these logs?
 yoh_	blackburn: no way -- they are a property of the communist part of C.!
 yoh_	nah... of D.!
 yoh_	;) https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=shogun&arch=armhf&ver=1.1.0-6&stamp=1345539853
 yoh_	more from here: https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun
 blackburn	oh my it is pretty big
 blackburn	super lu is absent
 blackburn	strange, okay not a problem
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rcbc0150 / src/shogun/structure/StructuredModel.cpp : Changed type of loop variable in StructuredModel - http://git.io/JZa_1g
@sonney2k	yoh_, of course we don't run any tests... otherwise the build will take >1d on arm etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you willing to have modsel typemaps in 2.0?
 blackburn	we have to freeze at some point
 blackburn	sonney2k: has TU bb gone?
 blackburn	cygwin one
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, extra typemaps for these kind would be nice but if they dont' make it we put them in 2.1 right?
@sonney2k	or 2.0.1
 blackburn	exactly
 blackburn	but 2.0 should be more or less stable
@sonney2k	blackburn, however these are totally non-intrusive and won't hurt if not yet ready
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	as stable as possible
 blackburn	I have time now but a little lost what to do
 blackburn	now I am finishing multiclass output requested by yoo a few times
@sonney2k	blackburn, update NEWS? try to get tests to work perfectly (even old ones?)
 blackburn	oh NEWS
 blackburn	I love to update news :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: however warnings are at soft zero
 blackburn	that's actually nice
 blackburn	ahh I need to implement director structured model
 blackburn	very important thing to have
@sonney2k	yeah but could as well be in 2.0.1
@sonney2k	tests / doc is probably most important now
 blackburn	no, disagree here
 blackburn	sounds very important
 blackburn	however
@sonney2k	blackburn, very few people will use directors!
 blackburn	may be I am wrong
 blackburn	sonney2k: BMRM + python code sounds vvverrry interesting
 blackburn	pure prototyping
@sonney2k	ahh and we have to write some blog entry with nice figures ...
@sonney2k	though I didn't receive any further ones...
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	well I really thought about that
 blackburn	but still so hard to came with any idea for me
 blackburn	:(
@sonney2k	blackburn, well multiclass is easy ... just illustrate e.g. 3-5 gaussians and decision surfaces for all the MC methods
@sonney2k	multitask is more difficult
 blackburn	hmm multitask could be
@sonney2k	but one could create one toy example showing the solution for the 'vanilla' svm and one for a dual task one
 blackburn	like
@sonney2k	so show how solutions changes...
 blackburn	pictures coming from 3 sources
 blackburn	I'll try something
 blackburn	dimension reduction is the easiest here
@sonney2k	for SO  / latent variable SO we really need some fancy example like license plate recognition, speech recognition, background detection (in images)...
@sonney2k	but that is lots of work
 blackburn	sonney2k: good example, sound like Phd
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	not when you have all the methods available already
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is of same effort as your traffic sign detector
 blackburn	sonney2k: I still didn't get how could that even work (background detection with SO)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I totally failed with L1/Lq btw :(
 blackburn	I thought it is worth to regularize cells with L2
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is a segmentation problem you have to decide for each pixel if it is background or foreground
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, I understand
 blackburn	but how technically not yet
@sonney2k	however doing so independently (naiive way) misses correlations... so SO can help here
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not an image guy so better ask wiking - he did things like this IIRC
 blackburn	sonney2k: can that be done with HM having #pixels states?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh for GPs we have nice figures right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, between 2 ... #pixels states :D
@sonney2k	#pixels sounds a bit stupid
 blackburn	why?
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	so hidden states are
@sonney2k	would then be like SVM
 blackburn	back and fore?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	what are observations?
 blackburn	pixels?
@sonney2k	but maybe some more
 blackburn	intensities?
 blackburn	or some fancy stuff like hogs would work too?
@sonney2k	some features computed based on pixels / neighborhood
@sonney2k	I would guess so
 blackburn	lbp etc?
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	I could develop an example then
 blackburn	if I understand correctly
 blackburn	we have everything
 blackburn	to do that
@sonney2k	well one thing maybe not
 blackburn	which one?
@sonney2k	I only understand how things work for 1d images
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	so you would go through an image from left to right
 blackburn	1d images?
 blackburn	lol
@sonney2k	(one line only :)
@sonney2k	and get a state sequence F-B-B-B-B-F-F ... etc
 blackburn	why not to flatten it row by row then?
@sonney2k	blackburn, the dependencies matter
 blackburn	ahh wait wait
 blackburn	so we observe only neighborhood
 blackburn	of each pixel
 blackburn	not the whole image
 blackburn	right?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	I start to understand these pictures I have seen with CRFs segmentation
 blackburn	there they had 9 observations and some network of it
@sonney2k	but in SO you have the state model (simplest 2 states F & B)
@sonney2k	and you learn some weights going from F -> B and back
@sonney2k	so this somehow needs to be taken into account
@sonney2k	yeah it is more like a network
@sonney2k	(e.g. markov network)
 blackburn	okay I see
 blackburn	you made me interested I should try
@sonney2k	blackburn, in this sense speech recognition is much simpler
 blackburn	this is the application I do not understand even more
 blackburn	in means of features
 blackburn	how do they construct features?
@sonney2k	you just have a number of states (phonems) and combine these phonems into most likely words
 blackburn	how do they detect phonems?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well a sample of a phonem
 blackburn	is it a solved problem?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	okay I see
@sonney2k	well basically you have some known phonems in training
@sonney2k	and then you can fit gaussians or so on them
@sonney2k	(HMMs with guassians are the standard approach for that task)
 blackburn	sonney2k: can I fit segmentation HM with one image?
 blackburn	would that work at all?
 blackburn	not in generalization means but at least would it segment the image I used?
@sonney2k	well if you used say 30% of the image for training then maybe
@sonney2k	blackburn, the methods here are all supervised
 blackburn	in other words
@sonney2k	so not like a HMM that could (in theory) also segment the image in one go
 blackburn	would it reproduce the same pattern?
 blackburn	at least approximately
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	sounds like pretty interesting thing
@sonney2k	depending on #states it will reproduce the exact image :D
 blackburn	I have to do that because I hardly believe :D
@sonney2k	let me better work on the website...
 blackburn	instead of?
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have any (just any) idea what could make our HMM class fail?
 blackburn	I assume it was working before?
@sonney2k	blackburn, does it fail now?
 blackburn	test - yes
@sonney2k	ahh test... ohh well it is difficult. randomly initialized parameters NP hard problem...
@sonney2k	I would need to check...
@sonney2k	if the 3 dice problem still works then it is good though
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	(3 dice with different distributions are drawn lots of times - a 3 state HMM can learn the distribution of the dice figures and when they were drawn)
 yoh_	sonney2k: well -- it would be neat if tests were run... at least selectively for some architectures... and yeah -- it does take a while to build some of my packages on ARM because of that... ARM people should make faster chips/ports ;)
 yoh_	imho it is better to make machines sweat than later on troubleshoot bug reports (although it is indeed unlikely to see shogun users on eg s390 ;) ) ;)
 blackburn	We have processed the evaluation for your project named Implement multitask and domain adaptation algorithms with Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox.
@sonney2k	blackburn, and failed as usual ;-)
@sonney2k	I have 8 emails of this kind
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do I manage to fail it year by year?
 blackburn	I am tired of it already :(
@sonney2k	at least now the Rubel rolls right :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://94.23.237.10:5000/
* sonney2k Zzzz...
 blackburn	sonney2k: doesn't work for me

 heiko1	dude this is horros on the mobile keyboard :)
 heiko1	thesis is coming along, has been a prett yintense week
 blackburn	I imagine
 heiko1	as always: its more work than I thought :)
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko1	but still 2 weeks left
 heiko1	so this will be ok
 blackburn	I thought I will do my bachelor thesis in a week LOL
 heiko1	thats optimistic :)
 blackburn	very
 heiko1	but I have talked to people who havent start writing things down yet

 blackburn	I knew quite a few guys who acted this way
 blackburn	they are in army now
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	lol :)
 blackburn	won't work for you though
 heiko1	no too old already
 heiko1	(and did civil service)
 blackburn	I have 6 more years of hiding
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	oh man
 heiko1	come to Germany :)
 blackburn	heiko1: well it won't work :)
 blackburn	everybody would come to germany if it allows to avoid army :D
 heiko1	ok
 heiko1	is your thesis processed already?
 blackburn	there is a traditional russian way
 blackburn	processed in which mean?
 heiko1	like feedback
 blackburn	I am unsure what do you mean :)
 blackburn	feedback from?
 heiko1	supervisors
 heiko1	like marks
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	yes I defended it already
 heiko1	oh really, nice
 heiko1	congrats then :)
 blackburn	hah thanks
 blackburn	but I am a bachelor for two months already
 heiko1	cool
 heiko1	whats next?
 blackburn	masters here
 heiko1	computer science?
 heiko1	what courses and stuff?
 blackburn	oh well
 blackburn	you know we are crazy here
 blackburn	I will study just what they give me
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	and that is?
 blackburn	I have nothing to choose but it should be related to supercomputing
 blackburn	I don't care much about that - I am coming along with shogun and other stuff
 blackburn	I already had to learn everything by myself
 heiko1	ok
 blackburn	so no reason to change that
 blackburn	:)
 heiko1	well then :)
 blackburn	heiko1: what about you then? :)
 blackburn	are you going to do phd there?
 heiko1	well, thesis first
 heiko1	I got a small RA position here for about half a year afterwards
 heiko1	and then I need another one :)
 blackburn	research assistant?
 blackburn	I have no clue what it is
 heiko1	but i will apply for a phd that starts in sept
 heiko1	yeah assistant
 blackburn	so it is just like a normal job?
 heiko1	no its uni and research stuff
 heiko1	but applied
 heiko1	kernel methods to detect xy
 blackburn	yeah I mean normal research job
 heiko1	yes
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	is it well-paid in england btw?
 heiko1	yes, especially in london
 blackburn	I heard londongrad is not cheap to live
 blackburn	:)
 heiko1	no, its not cheap at all
 heiko1	but my girlfriend has a well paid job, and I will join in that fashion, so its fine -- finally last year was so anoyying money wise
 blackburn	what does she do?
 heiko1	she works in the citi, for a digital media data mining company
 blackburn	wow so a data mining?
 heiko1	well, old fashioned data mining
 heiko1	nothing advanced
 heiko1	but collecting data
 blackburn	still geeky
 blackburn	:)
 heiko1	shes more in the organisation and planning
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	is she german too?
 blackburn	I am currently debugging MC output stuff
 blackburn	which collects ROCs
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	monte carlo ?
 heiko1	multiclass :)
 blackburn	multiclass :)
 heiko1	sorry
 blackburn	but I don't mind to have some monte carlo out there
 blackburn	may be some casino royale
 heiko1	Oh, I want to work on the labels a bit on the weekend
 blackburn	would be interested
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	lol :)
 blackburn	have you seen Ernst&Young guy?
 blackburn	in the ML
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	pretty cool :)
 heiko1	machine learning arrives in the consulting
 blackburn	we are all perplexed how can it be used
 heiko1	dont know
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko1	all the bankers are using (bayesian) linear regression
 blackburn	we was puzzled with the fashion he names himself
 heiko1	one of our profs here always tells us whats going on in the citi
 heiko1	linear regresseion :)
 blackburn	heh
 heiko1	I did not get your last scentence
 blackburn	he names himself
 blackburn	arthur (sean)
 blackburn	at first he wrote sth like
 blackburn	cheers, sean
 blackburn	but email is arthur
 blackburn	that's kind of puzzle :D
 heiko1	ah, mmh no idea
 heiko1	blackburn, what about the labels
 heiko1	with the confidences /scores
 blackburn	ah
 heiko1	have you seen s?rens email?
 blackburn	oh bad bad
 blackburn	which one?
 heiko1	I liked the idea of registering multiple vectors with a name
 blackburn	I remember one
 heiko1	and then you set the "current" one
 heiko1	and call a method
 heiko1	this way you can switchj
 blackburn	the most confusing thing for me is that we all wanted to release
 heiko1	yeah maybe leave that then
 heiko1	the method is there
 heiko1	though its only for binary
 blackburn	I have checked multiclass stuff a little
 heiko1	argh there is still the migration stuff
 blackburn	oops
 heiko1	that will be horrible
 blackburn	so do we need to set up all the maps now?
 heiko1	all these changes to the vectors cause loads of memory bugs
 heiko1	dont know yet
 heiko1	if we can migrate, maybe
 heiko1	but I think this wont work
 heiko1	so we will break
 heiko1	and start from scratch
 heiko1	that stuff is a mess, especially in c++ without any libraries
 blackburn	argh mkl storage fails with mkl multiclass
 heiko1	and whenever somethings changed, it fails
 heiko1	oh reall, what happens?
 blackburn	some error message I can't see
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	ahhhhh
 blackburn	heiko1: it handles MKLMulticlass as multiclass
 heiko1	and then?
 blackburn	hmmm
 blackburn	something strange happens then
 heiko1	mmh, if errors should be easy to track
 blackburn	heiko1: we should mark down all these *outputs as experimental stuff
 blackburn	to aavoid some psycho trying to find us and eat
 heiko1	mmh
 heiko1	I mean the idea is that only classes that are supported work with it
 heiko1	so every class gets another implementation of the output class
 heiko1	the output class can ignore things
 blackburn	heiko1: are you able to check code?
 heiko1	yeah, I want to go to bed, but send it :)
 blackburn	ah nevermind I'd rather paste
 blackburn	 84 ????????????SG_PRINT("%smulti-class machine %d:\n", i);
 blackburn	something is wrong out there
 blackburn	what was the intention?
 blackburn	there are two formatters but one var

 blackburn	n4nd0: !
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey!
 n4nd0	are we all happy with the final evaluations? did everyone pass?
 blackburn	yes I think so
 heiko1	should :)
 heiko1	at least I am happy
 blackburn	I wanted to develop a simple application that segments an image
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 blackburn	so it is a two state model I guess
 blackburn	I wanted to ask if we are ready for that
 blackburn	can that be done using current framework?
 n4nd0	I have not much idea about image segmentation
 n4nd0	can you tell me more about the application?
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay let me try to describe
 heiko1	blackburn, talk to you later, I need to sleep
 blackburn	heiko1: okay sure
 n4nd0	heiko1: good night!
 blackburn	n4nd0: simplest case is image having foreground and background
 heiko1	night guys! :)
 blackburn	nite heiko1
 blackburn	n4nd0: so two hidden states
 blackburn	and each pixel has its own state
 blackburn	observations are not so clear to me though
 n4nd0	blackburn: the actual values of the pixels I guess
 blackburn	yes but in neighborhood of each pixel
 blackburn	I guess
 n4nd0	and probably something that gives infor  about the pixels around
 n4nd0	exatly
 n4nd0	exactly*
 blackburn	I still have weak belief how can that work :D
 n4nd0	I'd say that the framework should work for that
 n4nd0	but we need to find some information about the features that people use for this
 blackburn	it is not a problem lets try to come along with pixels
 n4nd0	blackburn: have you read about it in some paper?
 blackburn	no, not really we discussed it with soeren
 blackburn	so it comes from air
 blackburn	and can be wrong :D
 n4nd0	I think so far sounds reasonable
 blackburn	I have to draw

 n4nd0	but more research on the topic is probably necessary though
 blackburn	I had a link somewhere
 blackburn	to web service allowing to draw
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you know any service like that?
 n4nd0	mmm no
 blackburn	http://www.twiddla.com/496234
 blackburn	n4nd0: here you  go
 blackburn	n4nd0: waiting for you ^ :)
