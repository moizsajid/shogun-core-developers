@wiking	heh http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-license/index.html
@wiking	:>
@wiking	interesting parts
 lisitsyn1	wiking: jquery!
@wiking	this actually makes me wonder why dont we offer at least a part of the lib under bsd licence
 lisitsyn1	wiking: because we desperately don't want somebody to use our software ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn1: btw: this is fucking crazy: http://bit.ly/17V70FQ
@wiking	lisitsyn1: this query actually uses different metadata providers
@wiking	like dbpedia and linked movie db
@wiking	to generate this information
 lisitsyn1	wiking: liblinear in da iphonez
 lisitsyn1	uhm I don't get it
 lisitsyn1	wiking: what is it at all?
@wiking	the query is:  all the actors of Star Trek: The Motion Picture and their birth day.
 lisitsyn1	oh I see
@wiking	this information is in 2 different databases: wikipedia and linked movie database
@wiking	and semantic web + sparql actually allows u this
 lisitsyn1	wiking: and this is made of some semantic shit?
@wiking	to create queries like this
 lisitsyn1	cool
@wiking	fucking amazing
 lisitsyn1	yes quite good
@wiking	i was just looking into this shit for 2 days
@wiking	and it's amazing how much semantic web endpoints are available
@wiking	:)
@wiking	and let's not talk about semantica reasoning :)
@wiking	*semantical
@wiking	fucking crazy shit
@wiking	lisitsyn1: http://pastebin.com/DEECEttn
@wiking	the actual query
@wiking	:)
@wiking	u can feed this into this: http://sparql.org/sparql.html
@wiking	lisitsyn1: or at least lgpl

 lisitsyn1	wiking: or at least mit/bsd ;)
@wiking	:)
@wiking	btw can i link shogun-toolbox github user with index.docker.io to start creating trusted builds? ;)
@wiking	awesome stuff from docker ;0
@wiking	:)
@wiking	"This service can build Docker containers from your source code and Dockerfile automatically. After you have linked your repository we can automatically build a new container every time you commit code to your repository."
@wiking	i.e. just like travis the service automagically updates the docker image ;)

-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.174.206] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
@sonney2k	wiking, better ask the github guys - in any case you have 2 roles now the shogun and your personal one
@wiking	yep
@wiking	realised
@wiking	but i cannot force to add it to shogun profile
@sonney2k	wiking, #github?
@wiking	yep trying that
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.175.197] has joined #shogun
@wiking	sonney2k: we should update the gravatar image to a higher resolution
@wiking	btw g+ is crazy Your profile was suspended because it violates our names policy
@wiking	*this is shogun-team* :)
@sonney2k	wiking, but our youtube thing still works right?
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah of course that's unrelated of g+
@sonney2k	wiking, not really of course nowadays with google...
@wiking	Server Error (500)

@wiking	ok we have a feature missing in the index.docker.io
@wiking	so we'll have to wait for being able to link with an organizational account... in order to have trusted builds :)
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah we need packages packages packages
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	sonney2k: i see no need for packages anymore with docker :P
@wiking	it's actually a selfcontained package
 lisitsyn1	developers developers
 lisitsyn1	developers developers
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah you! you are probably the only one here who knows how to use docker stuff
@wiking	sonney2k: come on man
@wiking	sonney2k: it even has a .deb pkg
@wiking	:)
@wiking	as well a fedora
@wiking	and for all other linux distros
@wiking	apt-get install docker
@sonney2k	wiking, then write some README_docker.md
@sonney2k	I bet none of us core devs even knows what to do
@wiking	sonney2k: even wrote an email
@wiking	on the mailing list
@sonney2k	wiking, I remember
@wiking	btw maybe there are to many README_* shits
@wiking	should we just add wiki pages or something?
@wiking	btw!!!
@wiking	when do we have the next dev meeting?
@sonney2k	wiking, i also don't like the number of README_*'s
@sonney2k	but would you put this in doc where no one finds it?
@sonney2k	wiking, no wiki page no :)
@sonney2k	wiking, plan is to render the *.md pages (with links!) on the website
@wiking	sonney2k: or docs?
@wiking	sonney2k: have one README.md
@wiking	and it refers to other mds
@wiking	but they are under docs
@wiking	(or doc)
@sonney2k	fine with me
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw what is the status of the markdown endeavour?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, nothing new
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so your suggestion yesterday was not to use the markdown js by the python package for markdown, right?
@iglesiasg	but I don't understand, it should be possible to do with the js as well!

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes - I mean I am not too comfortable with rendering it as .js - think of someone who doesn't have js enabled
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.181.129] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	uehm no enabled js?
 lisitsyn	in 2013?
@iglesiasg	we already have other js stuff in the webpage
 lisitsyn	we should think of supporting zx spectrum then :D
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes but not as hard requirement to view basic content on the page
@sonney2k	noscript
@sonney2k	lots of people use this plugin
 lisitsyn	oh well..
