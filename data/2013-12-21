 pickle27	looks like I'm not the only one who hasn't had much time for shogun recently https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/graphs/commit-activity
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hey there
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: you are right ;)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: how is it going?
 pickle27	quite good! whats new with you?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: nothing interesting to be honest :)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: trying to catch up with pre-new-year things
 lisitsyn	are you on holidays already?
 pickle27	office doesn't technically close til the 25th but its getting pretty slack
 lisitsyn	I see
 pickle27	this was friday https://twitter.com/shopifyapi/status/414093463500517376
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hah
 pickle27	life is good but I
 pickle27	I
 pickle27	I've been spending most my time on work related side projects and learning
 pickle27	doesn't leave much time for shogun :(
 pickle27	I still want to add my opencv integration stuff!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah would be good to have that layer
 lisitsyn	though I have absolutely no idea how to design it
 pickle27	yeah, I have that gist but how we integrate still needs to be planned
 wiking	iglesiasg pong
 sonney2k_	pickle27, ho ho ho ;)
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, still have deadlines?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: a bit better
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: I keep your notebooks request in mind ;)
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, yes yes please :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: just recall holidays here are from jan 1st
 lisitsyn	no xmas :)
 lisitsyn	well there is xmas but it is in january :D
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, very good
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, I consider doing a shogun 3.1 release over x-mas
 lisitsyn	alreadY?
 sonney2k_	yeah I know we are long overdue
 sonney2k_	we should have had bugfix releases way earlier...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: but 3.1? is that a good version for a bugfix release
-!- besser82 [~besser82@fedora/besser82] has quit [Quit: freedom, friends, features, first ---> fedoraproject.org]
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, problem is that this is no longer a bugfix release
 sonney2k_	but features too :/
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: yeah
 lisitsyn	true
 lisitsyn	okay then it is ok
 sonney2k_	doing a release is still too much work
 sonney2k_	we really need to simplify that still

 wiking	iglesiasg: u were looking for me?
@iglesiasg	wiking, oh yes. I actually thought about mailing you but forgot
@iglesiasg	wiking, I tried to compile against Mosek but miserably failed
@iglesiasg	wiking, have you done that some time using cmake?
 wiking	iglesiasg: oh, which?
@iglesiasg	wiking, mosek 7
 wiking	iglesiasg: yeah i did... you need to set some MOSEK macro
 wiking	and that's all
 wiking	cannot remember exactly which
@iglesiasg	wiking, I set this MOSEK_DIR
 wiking	and since my system just crashed like 2 days ago
 wiking	i dont have zsh history :P
@iglesiasg	wiking, cmake variable to the directory of my mosek installation
 wiking	iglesiasg: yeah i think so
 wiking	i've set that to be
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	shit i dont have mosek either
@iglesiasg	wiking, hmmm however, after configuration and generation the other two mosek variables are NOT_FOUND
 wiking	iglesiasg: by cmake?
@iglesiasg	wiking, yep
 wiking	iglesiasg: because then the MOSEK_DIR is not set to the right place
 wiking	i mean not to the right level in the mosek dir hierarchy
@iglesiasg	wiking, I see. I tried with a couple of directories
@iglesiasg	wiking, let me tell you which ones
@iglesiasg	so I have my mosek root dir
@iglesiasg	I tried with that one and also
@iglesiasg	$mosek_root_dir/7/tools/platform/linux64x86
 wiking	mm
 wiking	lemme check on github
 wiking	as i have no clue really atm
@iglesiasg	wiking, aham! I should be possible to find this out from the FindMosek file?
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	 if (MOSEK_DIR)
 wiking	    find_path (
 wiking	      MOSEK_INCLUDE_DIR
 wiking	        NAMES mosek.h
 wiking	        HINTS "${MOSEK_DIR}"
 wiking	        PATH_SUFFIXES "${MOSEK_TOOLS_SUFFIX}/h"
 wiking	        DOC "Include directory for MOSEK libraries."
 wiking	        NO_DEFAULT_PATH
 wiking	    )
 wiking	so as u can seee
 wiking	according to this
 wiking	MOSEK_DIR=$mosek_root_dir/7
@iglesiasg	wiking, let me try
 wiking	as MOSEK_TOOLS_SUFFIX will be tools/platform/<os><arch>
 wiking	yeah try that
 wiking	should wok
@iglesiasg	wiking, awesome
 wiking	work
@iglesiasg	you did it :)
@iglesiasg	at least I can see that the other MOSEK* variables are set now
 wiking	yeah not soooo surprising as it worked before :P
 wiking	it should work really

@iglesiasg	wiking, btw, I had to include /home/iglesias/workspace/mosek/7/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin in LD_LIBRARY_PATH to success compilation
@iglesiasg	wiking, shouldn't this be handled automatically?
 wiking	iglesiasg: noup
 wiking	iglesiasg: it's with every library which is not in the default libary path
 wiking	you have to do this
 wiking	and i believe /home/iglesias/workspace/mosek/7/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin  isn't among your library path ;P
@iglesiasg	wiking, aham I see
@iglesiasg	haha no
 wiking	if u would install mosek under /usr/local/lib
 wiking	then you wouldn't have any issues like this
 wiking	or like /usr/lib
@iglesiasg	wiking, the whole mosek dir should go under /usr/lobal/lib?
 wiking	nono
 wiking	just the libs
 wiking	;)
@iglesiasg	aaaah ok
 wiking	i.e. /home/iglesias/workspace/mosek/7/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin
 wiking	or just symlink
@iglesiasg	it makes sense
 wiking	anyhow this shouldn't be handled by shogun
 wiking	sonney2k_: can u send me this urgently if i ask u very nicely: http://www.ebay.de/itm/Apple-MacBook-PRO-13-A1278-HDD-flex-cable-821-0814-A-Festplatte-Anschluss-Kabel-/171174479138?pt=DE_Computer_Sonstige&hash=item27dacb4522
