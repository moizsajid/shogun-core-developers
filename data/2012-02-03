 policecar	hey hey
 policecar	i'm trying to do model selection w/ cross-validation, LibSVMMultiClass and a Gaussian kernel in python. i've tried to follow your examples closely for starters but i always get a "parameter with name C does not exist" error.
 policecar	i was wondering if i'm not instantiating the classifier correctly. how would i do that if i have a range of values rather than a single value per parameter?
 blackburn	hey
 policecar	hey
 blackburn	too bad there is no heiko here
 policecar	is he the guy to ask? ; )
 blackburn	sure, he is an author of the CV stuff
 policecar	d'you think he'll come by sometime?
 blackburn	well let me try to help you
 policecar	ok, kewl
 policecar	should i paste code?
 blackburn	yeah would be start point for us
 policecar	the basic structure is the following
 policecar	root = ModelSelectionParameters()
 policecar	C = ModelSelectionParameters( "C" );
 policecar	root.append_child( C )
 policecar	C.build_values( 1, 11, R_EXP )
 policecar	gauss_kernel = GaussianKernel()
 policecar	kernel = ModelSelectionParameters( 'kernel', gauss_kernel )
 policecar	root.append_child( kernel )
 policecar	width = ModelSelectionParameters( 'width' )
 policecar	width.build_values( 1, 2, R_EXP )
 policecar	kernel.append_child( width )
 policecar	classifier = LibSVMMultiClass()
 policecar	feats = RealFeatures( features )
 policecar	labels = Labels( labels )
 policecar	splitting_strategy = StratifiedCrossValidationSplitting( labels, 10 )
 policecar	evaluation_criterium = ContingencyTableEvaluation( ACCURACY )
 policecar	hm, not the best place maybe, i'm being throttled due to flooding
 blackburn	hoho
 blackburn	:)
 policecar	wrt classifier, i also tried adding the following lines, to no avail
 policecar	classifier.set_C( 0.0, 1.0 )
 policecar	classifier.set_kernel( gauss_kernel )
 blackburn	there is set_C1 and set_C2
 blackburn	but why set_kernel fails - no idea
 policecar	i dunno if it fails, i just still get the same error msg that parameter named C doesn't exist
 blackburn	ah
 policecar	one could also try walking the reverse way... the error is thrown by Parameter.cpp if !own
 policecar	and try to figure when and why that is the case
 blackburn	I feel shame for having difficulties with toolbox where I am a developer
 blackburn	:D
 policecar	oh no
 blackburn	hmm
 policecar	but it's a complex collection
 blackburn	policecar: are you subscribed to the mailing list?
 policecar	no
 policecar	i searched for the problem online, and got results from the mailing list i think but i'm not a subscriber
 policecar	so far i communicated here and on github
 blackburn	policecar: that would be nice if you subscribe and ask your question on the mailing list
 blackburn	then others would find how to solve the problem later
 policecar	alright
 policecar	will do
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	I think Heiko will answer rather rapidly
 blackburn	unfortunately have to go now
 blackburn	see you later

 eric	hi
-!- eric is now known as Guest54284
 Guest54284	would like information for linking shogun library with cmake
 Guest54284	anyone did this before ?
 sonne|work	Guest54284: never tried but it is just -lshogun if you want to link against it
 Guest54284	I am working on a C++ project for computer vision
 Guest54284	using many C++ libraries
 Guest54284	what advice could you tell me using shogun ofr calssification
 Guest54284	my application is realtime
 Guest54284	Should I use directly shogunlib (c++)
 Guest54284	or better use modular interface ?
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@210.212.58.111] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	most certainly libshogun from C++ is what you want
 sonne|work	Guest54284: for prototyping you could try a modular interface (like python_modular)
 sonne|work	it is very easy then to switch to C++ later (same syntax)
 Guest54284	ok thanks a lot
 Guest54284	great work btw
 Ram108	sonney2k: hi i need some help regarding how to make a code shogun like
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@194.78.35.195] has left #shogun []
 Guest54284	hi again, got lots of undefined "clapack" when compiling some shogun example
 Guest54284	however I compile and install shogun without any error

 eric	hi there
-!- eric is now known as Guest7912
 blackburn	hi
 Guest7912	question about shogun compilation
 blackburn	shoot
 Guest7912	I didn't manage to compile with numpy support
 Guest7912	numpy + matplotlib installed
-!- Ram108 [~amma@219.64.147.192] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
 blackburn	was it detected while configure?
 Guest7912	but ./configure send NO python numpy support
 blackburn	what is os you use?
 Guest7912	ubuntu 64b
 blackburn	then sudo apt-get install python-dev
 Guest7912	done
 blackburn	that's the required thing
 Guest7912	I know
 Guest7912	have reinstall completely
 blackburn	so, is it 'NO' still?
 Guest7912	yes that's why I'm here :p
 Guest7912	crazy thing
 blackburn	hmm
 Guest7912	what difference give ./configure --target=amd64 ?
 blackburn	well I've never used it..
 blackburn	why do you want to specify target?
 Guest7912	coz simple ./configure give host architecture i386 ..
 blackburn	hmm
 Guest7912	I just download the lastest git version
 Guest7912	and same errors ..
 Guest7912	should I write the output of ./configure here ?
 blackburn	not here but please paste it somewhere
 blackburn	strange that i386 was detected, shouldn't be, we will try to fix
 Guest7912	lastest git code give me the right architecture x86_64
 blackburn	ah then use latest :)
 Guest7912	but still no python support detected
 Guest7912	I just tried with another lib and no numpy support detected again ...
 blackburn	wait a min
 Guest7912	then smthg wrong with MY config
 blackburn	could you please
 blackburn	run python
 blackburn	and enter
 blackburn	import numpy
 Guest7912	ImportError: /usr/lib/liblapack.so.3gf: undefined symbol: ATL_chemv
 blackburn	hah ok
 Guest7912	lapack-dev installed btw
 Guest7912	so is libatlas-dev
 blackburn	hmm something went wrong with numpy+atlas/lapack
 blackburn	could you please remove libatlas
 Guest7912	should I remove atlas ?
 Guest7912	okok
 blackburn	and try to import numpy once again
 Guest7912	AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'core'
 blackburn	what is your ubuntu version btw?
 Guest7912	ImportError: /usr/lib/liblapack.so.3gf: undefined symbol: ATL_chemv again
 Guest7912	11.10
 blackburn	did you install anything related by hand?
 Guest7912	ffmpeg ?
 blackburn	damn that's crazy
 blackburn	so you told me you reinstalled things already
