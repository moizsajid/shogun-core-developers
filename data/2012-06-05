 n4nd0	heiko: good night, a bit late though :S
 blackburn	hah! I managed to introduce some group theory in thesis
 n4nd0	group theory?
 blackburn	yes :D
 blackburn	cyclic group of gradient operators
 n4nd0	I think I had never heard about group theory before
 blackburn	really?
 n4nd0	really
 blackburn	heh funny
 n4nd0	take a look at this
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/vaaO8
 n4nd0	at the messages with SG_PRINT in particular
 n4nd0	I don't really like the idea of printing these messages everywhere, it makes the code kind of unreadable
 n4nd0	but they make the checks everywhere in MOSEK examples
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you think?
 blackburn	who did that?
 n4nd0	that code is mine
 blackburn	well having informative messages is cool
 n4nd0	I don't really like to have them everywhere in the code
 blackburn	what is alternative?
 n4nd0	I was looking for some cool idea of yours :D
 blackburn	macro?
 blackburn	REQUIRE(condition, message)
 n4nd0	pse I don't know, maybe
 blackburn	e.g.
 n4nd0	looks better than what I do now to tell the truth
 blackburn	REQUIRE(mosek->get_rescode()==MSK_RES_OK, "Result code is not OK");
 n4nd0	all right, I had enough for today
 n4nd0	too tired :S
 n4nd0	good night!

 n4nd0	good morning wiking, how is it going?
 wiking	n4nd0: heheh great
 wiking	already awake for 3 hours now :)
 n4nd0	wow you started early today then!
 n4nd0	same time there? 07:53 here
 wiking	yep
 wiking	same time
 n4nd0	jet lag?
 n4nd0	I just wondered if you took a look to the so framework that is ready so far
 n4nd0	if everything is fitting well for your latent-svm

@sonney2k	heiko1, they all hang on buildbot (and on my machine too)
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	I for some reason did not see that
 heiko1	I already spotted the bad line

 foo__	hi
 foo__	I have questions about "StringFeatures::obtain_from_char_features" method.
 foo__	I get this error : SG_ERROR( "symbol does not fit into datatype \"%c\" (%d)\n", (char) max_val, (int) max_val);
 foo__	I use StringFeatures<uint16_t> and obtain_from_char_features to get 2-mer frequence histogram features, is that correct ?

@sonney2k	heiko1, ok - good luck for tomorrow
 heiko1	sonney2k, thanks! :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, hey. how are you?
@sonney2k	gsomix, fine :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, I hope you made some big progress while I am absent :D
@sonney2k	...and passed all your exams of course !
 gsomix	sonney2k, unfortunately, only exams.
 gsomix	but I'm working now

@sonney2k	heiko1, you are the owner of shogun/statistics basically
 heiko1	sonney2k, yes, why?
@sonney2k	heiko1, I am cleaning up CMath - where would you want to see entropy() / relative entropy() / fishers exact test for whatever ?
 heiko1	Yeah these should go to statistics in my eyes
 heiko1	and keep a wrapper in CMath but put a deprecated or so
@sonney2k	heiko1, where in statistics?
@sonney2k	I will just remove them
 heiko1	perhaps one can split up the statistics later
 heiko1	oh well there is only one file for the CStatistics class
 heiko1	the stuff in the statistics folder is for the new tests
 heiko1	But I want to merge later
@sonney2k	heiko1, shogun/statistics?
@sonney2k	ahh
 heiko1	no in math
@sonney2k	shogun/math/Statistics
 heiko1	there are all the basic functions
@sonney2k	hmmhh why is it not in shogun/statistics/Statistics.h etc?
 heiko1	because I added the statistics folder recently (fraft)
 heiko1	draft
 heiko1	I want to do that
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	so lgamma/ tgamma etc should also go into CStatistcs right?
 heiko1	also there is a difference between these advanced stat methods and the basic functions like mean/variance/fisher etc
 heiko1	yes
@sonney2k	heiko, ok thanks - then I will put it in there
 heiko1	sonney2k, alright!

 blackburn	hey there
 gsomix	blackburn, yo
@sonney2k	blackburn, about GMM - if you have time to fix it - please do.
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	-inf time
@sonney2k	hehe
 blackburn	these days
 blackburn	2 more I guess
 blackburn	finally preparing thesis
@sonney2k	then its destiny is sealed
 blackburn	I just was surprised you removed whole GSoC project :)

 n4nd0	sonney2k, gsomix: about the director classes, I think it could be a good idea to give support for the argmax function used in SO
 n4nd0	for the other ones (delta loss, joint feature) it could be useful too
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you think?

-!- puffin444 [472e31fb@gateway/web/freenode/ip.71.46.49.251] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	wiking: about Psi(x,y) and Psi(x,y,h), sonney2k suggested to use a implicit representation for the joint features
 n4nd0	following the idea of COFFIN
 n4nd0	something similar to what is done with CDotFeatures I believe
@sonney2k	n4nd0, agreed
@sonney2k	n4nd0, gsomix - the earlier/more we can use the new director stuff the better
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will devote time to the COFFIN issue once I have tested and debugged the current implementation with multiclass classification
@sonney2k	n4nd0, sure get the beast to work first :D
@sonney2k	wiking, thanks for the update
 n4nd0	can someone please help me with this error?
 wiking	sonney2k: no worries
 n4nd0	../../shogun/mathematics/Mosek.h:66: Error: Syntax error in input(3).
 n4nd0	make[1]: *** [modshogun_wrap.cxx] Error 1
@sonney2k	wiking, good to see you being back on track now
 n4nd0	and the line it is referring to is
 wiking	sonney2k: yep just i'm still waking up at 4am :D
 n4nd0	static void MSKAPI print(void* handle, char str[]);
@sonney2k	wiking, and for the future - please send us incremental pull requests
 wiking	other than that i'm good :P
 wiking	sonney2k: well i won't until i don't have something really useful
@sonney2k	no need to do full rebases then
 wiking	sonney2k: but yeah i'll first have to do the full reforking
@sonney2k	wiking, well we expect everyone to succeed anyways
 wiking	sonney2k: so that i'll be able to do a pull request one day
@sonney2k	so there is no reason in not submitting patches (that don't break other stuff) one by one
 wiking	yeah sure
@sonney2k	wiking, I think all you need to do is git format-patch on the old clone and then apply it to the new one
@sonney2k	wiking, n4nd0 went through this btw
@sonney2k	and all other too :)
 wiking	sonney2k: yep i was hoping for that
@sonney2k	others
 wiking	yeah i guessed :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, my suggestion is to ignore the whole mosek class
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I'll try with that
@sonney2k	n4nd0, %ignore CMosek; is the syntax
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you plan that we'll include this use of Mosek in the "final" version?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we can keep it but as I said almost no one can use it
@sonney2k	certainly not me, not the buildbot, ...
 n4nd0	n4nd0: yeah, we really need something to solve this QP
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well if there is time we can create some kind of optimizer interface that wraps the common tasks
@sonney2k	n4nd0, maybe this is post GSoC though...
@sonney2k	we have cplex as interface too
 n4nd0	sonney2k: Nico told me you discussed with him about it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you think that will imply lot of work?
 n4nd0	difficult?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well if it is 'just' one certain variant - say general QP with linear inequality and equality constraints + box constraints - no
@sonney2k	but there is lots of stuff underneath
@sonney2k	...hotstarts
@sonney2k	...type of optimizer (dual simplex, interior point,...)
@sonney2k	...presolver
@sonney2k	all that can make a huge difference in speed
@sonney2k	wiking, I hope you agree it is better to not have a 100MB crap data file in shogun's src code repo... so this repository recreation was really needed and worth the pain
* sonney2k has ping turn around times of 3600ms - yay
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you still at hiddensee?
@sonney2k	of course
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	totally hidden in the dune
@sonney2k	...sunset is just over
