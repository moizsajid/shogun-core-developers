@HeikoS	wiking: yeah!!!!
@HeikoS	meta examples now work with python3
@HeikoS	wiking: (if python-ply is installed)
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool
@HeikoS	wiking: the check is not working yet though ....
 sanuj	HeikoS: I'll work on adding eigen3 llt in krr
 sanuj	HeikoS: shall i add it in linalg and then use that in krr?
@HeikoS	sanuj: use eigen3 in krr for now
@HeikoS	and then add it to linalg anyways ... for the GPs
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	but KRR should continue to work without linalg for compat. reasons
@HeikoS	we dont want to break things and it is no big deal to change later
 sanuj	understood
@HeikoS	sanuj: but GP framework is based on linalg anyways, so we can use the LLT from linalg
 sanuj	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	as it is already unavailable without c++11 anyways
 sanuj	HeikoS: and i'll write my next cookbook page on SVMs
 sanuj	i'll start writing my gsoc proposals this weekend
@HeikoS	sanuj: great, looking forward to it

@HeikoS	lambday: so as I was saying, how shall the linalg functione be called?
@HeikoS	because spcifying the backend kind of defeats the purpose of being backend independent
@lambday	HeikoS: if eigen3 is default, to call eigen3 version you just do linalg::foo(...)
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@lambday	but to call viennacl, you specify the backend
@lambday	or native, for that fact
@HeikoS	lambday: since we dont want to automatically replace all calls via viennacl
@HeikoS	lambday: and this is why you are saying we dont need global backends
@HeikoS	and no vianna cl build?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah I really don't think it is of any practical use
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@HeikoS	lambday: what about this:
@lambday	there is no use-case when we'd want all our backends to be gpu
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	actually, it is fine
@HeikoS	putting things on the GPU is always an explicit decision
@HeikoS	ah yes, but here is a case I was thinking of
@HeikoS	say we implemented an algorithm using viennacl backend
@lambday	HeikoS: the other way it can be handled is to just overload the methods..
@HeikoS	no 2 cases might be a problem:
@lambday	linalg(SGType) calls eigen backend, linalg(GPUType) calls viennacl backend
@HeikoS	1.) we find a better library for doing gpu  backends ... then we have to change the algorithms, which is against the design pattern on linalg. so maybe rather than viennacl, we should call it GPU backend or so
@HeikoS	2.) what a user doesnt have a GPU
@HeikoS	then there needs to be the fall back option of running the same code on shared memory with the CPU
@HeikoS	again without changing the algorithm code
@lambday	HeikoS: viennacl+opencl can work on cpu as well
@HeikoS	ok, but do you see my point?
@HeikoS	we are kind of mixing hardware backends with software backends
@HeikoS	while hardware backend is clear when algo is written, software backend should be possible to change without touching the algorithms
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah I see what you mean..
@lambday	HeikoS: the dependency kind of have to be like eigen3... for all cpu computation we rely on eigen, for all gpu backends we rely on viennacl
@lambday	cause, the other better backend may not be as flexible as viennacl and may simply fail when no GPU is there
@lambday	viennacl can manage working on cpu as well
@HeikoS	I would offer a general (lib free) GPU backend that
@HeikoS	-uses viennaCL on GPU by default
@HeikoS	-uses viennaCL on CPU if no GPU is present
@HeikoS	-uses CPU backend if none is available
@HeikoS	and the general CPU backend
@HeikoS	-defaults with eigen3
@HeikoS	-we might add other libs to support its operations
@wiking	asdf
@wiking	FUCKING APPLE
@wiking	:)
@wiking	whats the problem with viennacl as gpu backend?
@HeikoS	wiking: just talked to lambday
@HeikoS	wiking: we want to refactor linalg a but
@HeikoS	bit
@HeikoS	wiking: the idea is to separate backend abstraction for library and hardware
@HeikoS	wiking: in algorithms, one only chooses which hardware backend is used, i.e. cpu or gpu
@HeikoS	wiking: and for each of those, cmake decides for a particular library at compile time
@HeikoS	currently it is all a bit mixed up
@HeikoS	we will do a one file prototype to illustrate the ideas
@HeikoS	with all the fallback options
@HeikoS	and then when compiling, based on what libraries and hardware is available, all those things are populated
@HeikoS	but then algorithm implementation in shogun only specifies cpu or gpu, not library
@HeikoS	this also means: no global viennacl backend anymore
@HeikoS	but you will see the prototype
@lambday	I'll try to cook something up by the end of this week for the prototype and share with you guys
