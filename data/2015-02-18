@lambday	rock_curve: hola
@rock_curve	lambday: hey
@lambday	rock_curve: did you register as a mentor already?
@rock_curve	lambday: no only as admin
@lambday	rock_curve: do I have to register here? https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/profile/register/org_member/google/gsoc2015
@rock_curve	I think so
@lambday	rock_curve: mentors also get tshirts?
@lambday	cool
@rock_curve	lambday: yes except some countries
@rock_curve	argentina, brazil, russia etc
@rock_curve	india works
@lambday	russia!!
@lambday	rock_curve: for students as well?
@rock_curve	lambday: yeah no t-shirts since 2012
@rock_curve	:D
@rock_curve	rock_curve: my t-shirts are delivered to sonney2k
@rock_curve	lambday: ^
@lambday	rock_curve: haha awesome! :D
@lambday	rock_curve: btw heiko and viktor discussed regarding the parallel engine idea over mail - viktor suggested that having mesos will solve it all
@rock_curve	some day I will be in berlin again I think
@rock_curve	lambday: yes mesos will solve everything
@lambday	rock_curve: you will be as in? visiting or staying?
@rock_curve	lambday: no just visiting :D
@lambday	rock_curve: hah
@lambday	rock_curve: did you think anything about PhD?
@rock_curve	lambday: well
@rock_curve	don't know
@rock_curve	:D
@rock_curve	lambday: I had crazy thoughts on philosophy phd
@lambday	rock_curve: lol don't worry you're fit for that too :D
@rock_curve	lambday: I am interested in aesthetics
@lambday	beauty man :D
@lambday	be a fashion show judge - will totally pay off for the knack :D
@rock_curve	lambday: yeah I am curious what is beauty
@rock_curve	haha no that's cool but different thing
@lambday	rock_curve: can't deny the "beauty" part of that though :P
@rock_curve	lambday: I mean I am really curious why, say, pollock paintings are so cool
@rock_curve	I find these questions more interesting than gaussian latent megamodel
@rock_curve	:D
@lambday	rock_curve: you mean to say which chemicals in our brain produces the "feel good about that" feeling? :D
@rock_curve	lambday: ohh that's very materialistic!
@lambday	rock_curve: haha! well, that's the science of it :D
@rock_curve	lambday: yes but you can't decide anything on that level
@lambday	dopamine I guess
@rock_curve	lambday: it's like researching car by its atoms
@rock_curve	on such level of detail you ain't gonna understand process
@lambday	rock_curve: now you talk like a philosophy major :D
@rock_curve	lambday: ok then tell me why dopamine is produced in any other educated brain that see a picture
@rock_curve	on neural level they are completely different
@rock_curve	no common configuration on low level
@rock_curve	but that works on high level
@rock_curve	that's what I mean :)
@lambday	rock_curve: lol I see your point
@lambday	rock_curve: I don't think beauty can **have** a common config
@lambday	what is beautiful to me may seem totally shitty to you
@lambday	imagine a jazz lover listening to 50cent
@rock_curve	lambday: well that's a question
@rock_curve	there are things everybody loves
@rock_curve	but most are different yes
@rock_curve	lambday: apparently there is something common
@rock_curve	and that's why it is worth investigating
@rock_curve	I mean if it was like everyone is really different then it would be described by dopamin
@rock_curve	or like his neural net is trained to produce happiness on that
@rock_curve	lambday: the most fascinating thing for me now is ortega y gasset's idea on dehumanization of art

@rock_curve	lambday: lost you
@rock_curve	:D
@lambday	rock_curve: lol yeah I came to a meeting :D
@lambday	rock_curve: will get back on that topic :P
@rock_curve	lambday: I can give you access to that thing that connects to irc
@rock_curve	irc bouncer
@rock_curve	I have an instance on digital ocean that does it for me
@rock_curve	:D
@lambday	rock_curve: irc bouncer? for always online irc handle?
@rock_curve	lambday: yes
@lambday	rock_curve: yeah that would be really useful :D
@lambday	rock_curve: so its a remote client which is logged in always
@lambday	what happens when I actually physically wanna see what's going on there?
@rock_curve	lambday: when you connect you receive messages that were here while you was offline
@lambday	rock_curve: cool!
@rock_curve	lambday: I am connected through this right now
@lambday	rock_curve: do I have to install something locally as well?
@rock_curve	lambday: no just use different irc address
@lambday	rock_curve: guide me o' master
@rock_curve	lambday: ok I am leaving home now can add account in a few hours
@lambday	rock_curve: alrighty
@rock_curve	lambday: bad thing is that I will know your pass ;)
@lambday	rock_curve: lol I trust you with that :D

@HeikoS	which is? :)
@rock_curve	lets make a gsoc application
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	thats for today
@HeikoS	so
@HeikoS	Ill register in melange
@HeikoS	done

@HeikoS	melange account
@rock_curve	your?
@HeikoS	yeh
@HeikoS	HeikoS
@HeikoS	did someone already register Shogun?
@rock_curve	yes
@HeikoS	where can I see that
@HeikoS	I saw someone did
@rock_curve	sonne
@HeikoS	was that you?
@rock_curve	you sure it is HeikoS?
@HeikoS	can you add me as mentor?
@HeikoS	or admin better
@rock_curve	can't send you this thing
@HeikoS	yes its HeikoS
@HeikoS	what thing?
@rock_curve	"HeikoS" is not a properly-formed identifier.
@rock_curve	can you change that?
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	"heiko"
@HeikoS	thats my user name
@rock_curve	man!
@rock_curve	:D
@HeikoS	public name is HeikoS
@rock_curve	done
@rock_curve	see mail
@HeikoS	no email yet
@HeikoS	....
@HeikoS	still not
@rock_curve	HeikoS: hmm try to look into my dashboard
@rock_curve	probably no email
@rock_curve	my connections
@HeikoS	nothing in there :(
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	there we go
@HeikoS	just chagned
@rock_curve	ok
@HeikoS	requested role
@HeikoS	pls do admin
@HeikoS	want to get emails
@rock_curve	already
@HeikoS	ok got it
@HeikoS	should I iterate over the thing a bit?
@HeikoS	where did we store last year's proposal?
@HeikoS	git?
@rock_curve	HeikoS: it is already filled in
@rock_curve	HeikoS: go to managed orgs
@HeikoS	yeah but we want to save the changes for next time
@rock_curve	and click on shogun
@rock_curve	hmm
@rock_curve	yeah we have shogun-publicity
@HeikoS	so not edit in melange, but rather in git
@HeikoS	and then changes are stored
@rock_curve	then use it
@HeikoS	did you yet change anything?
@rock_curve	no
@HeikoS	ok good
@rock_curve	HeikoS: I'll put logo
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	ill iterate a bit over the git documents
@rock_curve	HeikoS: I don't remember
@rock_curve	did we go with variational recommendations?
@rock_curve	HeikoS: we had no student on that, right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	Wu did
@HeikoS	the GP stuff
@rock_curve	hmm
@rock_curve	HeikoS: ah so we renamed it
@rock_curve	HeikoS: not about recommendations but variational stuff in general
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	almost done with editing
@rock_curve	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2677/files
@rock_curve	this is much simpler
@rock_curve	:D
@HeikoS	rock_curve: I pushed an update
@HeikoS	can you fill that in?
@HeikoS	change some things here and there
@HeikoS	put new links, last years GSoC, etc
@rock_curve	HeikoS: an update to shogun-publicity?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	actually
@HeikoS	nevermind
@HeikoS	I can change that
@rock_curve	ha
@rock_curve	yeah thanks
@rock_curve	I don't have it anyway
@rock_curve	would take time to set up
@HeikoS	rock_curve: where is this text coming from?
@HeikoS	Improving shoguns infrastructureIntegration of existing and new machine algorithms.
@HeikoS	1

@HeikoS	you know the one that shows up
@HeikoS	its not in the application

@lambday	HeikoS: hey
@lambday	HeikoS: I updated a few things on linalg ideas wiki
@lambday	HeikoS: I'm thinking that we should include iterative solvers as well - from eigen3 and viennacl
@lambday	its high time I learn some viennacl myself :D
@lambday	lisitsyn: hola
@lambday	lisitsyn: Wu has made some suggestions regarding in-place linalg operations for GPU https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2676
@lambday	lisitsyn: could use your notes on that
-!- kshitijk [~kshitijk@115.249.18.25] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	lambday: hmm yeah inplace is cool
@lambday	lisitsyn: could you please just go through last few comments
@lambday	also, I am thinking that elementwise operations should look something like linalg::element_wise<square>(A)
@lambday	not sure about row-wise/col-wise ops yet
@lambday	element_wise will take unary and binary functors as templates :/
@lambday	linalg::element_wise<product>(A, B, result)
@lambday	or in place
@lisitsyn	lambday: exactly
@lisitsyn	lambday: that's pretty cool way to do that
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah I think so too..
@lambday	lisitsyn: btw loved your from, to :P
@lisitsyn	lambday: ha
@lambday	lisitsyn: you have any idea reagarding the IO-efficient blocking tricks Wu is talking about?

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: still there?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	Ill forward you an email
@lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we need a user guide
@HeikoS	that lists all the methods we have
@HeikoS	like this : http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
@HeikoS	GSoC students can write this
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	but how to organise
@HeikoS	?
@lisitsyn	hmm
@HeikoS	The thing is: in order to stay maintainable, we need to include this in the build
@HeikoS	we had this idea with doxygen
@HeikoS	where one can include concrete example code in the docs
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we can jump to sphinx
@HeikoS	but that is so hard to edit
@HeikoS	lots of overhead
@HeikoS	remember what I mean?
@lisitsyn	it looks better and supports markdown
@HeikoS	doxygen support markdown
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	we should do something about this before GSoC
@HeikoS	we need a list with all methods in a neat form like the scikit people have
@HeikoS	and with code snippets that do things
@HeikoS	that are included in the build
@HeikoS	so best thing would be to include the modular example code in the page
@HeikoS	maybe rewrite here and there
@HeikoS	but yeah
@HeikoS	wrote this a while ago
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2602
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2600
@HeikoS	second one is the one I mean

@lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: hi!?
@lambday	HeikoS: I'll do that asap
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things?
@HeikoS	lambday: what do you think of this:
@lambday	HeikoS: things are good :)
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2600
@HeikoS	use this to generate a clone of this: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
@lambday	HeikoS: checking
@HeikoS	idea: use doxygen to write documentation. Code in there comes from actual examples so is executed in build. we need a documentation that lists all methods
@lambday	HeikoS: their docs are super cool
@HeikoS	lambday: do you think this doxygen way to do things is feasible?
@lambday	HeikoS: umm.. that would include writing a whole tutorial type of things with the class documentation right
@HeikoS	lambday: not quite
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
@HeikoS	have a look here
@HeikoS	it would involve writing  pages like this one
@lambday	HeikoS: oh wow.. this looks good
@lambday	HeikoS: so one root page can have multiple subpages for different methods?
@HeikoS	yeah, same structure as the scikit one
@HeikoS	and then the coolest thing ever
@lambday	HeikoS: that's awesome
@HeikoS	there will be a header link where one can change the language
@HeikoS	since the examples are implemented in the meta language
@HeikoS	so doxygen can generate this automatically for all languages
@lambday	HeikoS: greatest idea ever!!
@lambday	HeikoS: this really shows off shogun's true power
@HeikoS	so then we do the document structure ourselves
@HeikoS	yeah exactly
@HeikoS	we get a list of supported algos along with the fact that any languages can be sued
@HeikoS	used
@HeikoS	even tempted to make this a GSoC project
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@lambday	HeikoS: absolutely
@HeikoS	but maybe we can also just make applicants write some bits of it
@HeikoS	because its a lot to do for a single person
@HeikoS	not really coding
@HeikoS	though examples have to be written (in meta language
@HeikoS	)
@HeikoS	Shogun missionary 2
@HeikoS	mmmh
@lambday	HeikoS: well, porting all shogun examples in the meta languages developed is some coding :D
@lambday	yeah
@HeikoS	yeah true
@lambday	lol you type a lot faster than me :D
@HeikoS	hahah just had too much coffee :)

@lambday	HeikoS: anyway this is a super cool idea.. people use scikit learn more because they can figure out on their own what to do/how to do/where do we find stuffs
@HeikoS	yeah exactly
@lambday	hats off to him and you
@HeikoS	also just got an email by a guy being a potential mentor who complained that it is not even clear which methods are implemented in Shogun
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah... an entire class list is not a good place to do that
@HeikoS	and then the notebooks could be used to do more involved stuff
@lisitsyn	back
@HeikoS	I mean we have this
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/libshogun_examples.html
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/python_modular_examples.html
@HeikoS	but its horrible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday rather than having a project on this
@lisitsyn	?
@HeikoS	what about making every student write at least one little section each week?
@lisitsyn	good
@lisitsyn	g??d
@HeikoS	so then everyone learns about ML
@HeikoS	and m?re interaction is g?ing on
@lisitsyn	m?chine l?arning
@HeikoS	Ok Ill set up a prototype
@lambday	HeikoS: awesome idea!
@HeikoS	lambday: I probably need some help with structuring things from you guys
@HeikoS	Ill set up a PR now
@HeikoS	can we discuss in say an hour?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: will be in underground
@lisitsyn	in da tube
@HeikoS	lambday: so question 1 :)
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	how to generate multiple of these doxygen pages that replace
@HeikoS	\snippet classifier_libsvm_probabilities.cpp headers
@HeikoS	with
@HeikoS	\snippet classifier_libsvm_probabilities.py headers
@HeikoS	it would be cool if we did not have to have multiple doxygen files
@lambday	HeikoS: jinja2?
@HeikoS	maybe an indea
@HeikoS	lambday: though it would be cool to keep things super super simple to write
@HeikoS	ideally, we edit the pages from a wiki
@HeikoS	what do the scikit people use do you know?
@lambday	HeikoS: nah.. but I can check their src
@HeikoS	thing is also the plots the scikit documentation has are amazinh
@HeikoS	but we can only do them from python
@HeikoS	so what do we do with them?
@HeikoS	thinking more and more maybe this could be a GSoC
@HeikoS	and then we develop a little mini framework for this
@HeikoS	which uses jinja2 etc
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f052088178.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@HeikoS	hmmm
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah... about plots I'm not sure.. you're planning to do it in the same way that we do in ipython notebooks?
@lambday	in scikit they just show the plots
@HeikoS	maybe more like this:
@HeikoS	yeah
@lambday	'they don't tell how to generate those plots
@HeikoS	really?
@HeikoS	Ah I did not know
@HeikoS	I thought they were generated from the code
@HeikoS	ah no
@lambday	HeikoS: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	every plot has a link to code that generated it
@lambday	HeikoS: well I am also just now noticing
@lambday	ohh
@lambday	HeikoS: so plot can be python
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	so they have actually 2 things
@HeikoS	this
@HeikoS	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	which just contains code snippets
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah ... in the main page no code for plotting
@HeikoS	and then they have these examples  from which they show the plot
@HeikoS	but one has to click
@HeikoS	quite clever
@HeikoS	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#example-linear-model-plot-ols-py
@lambday	haha
@HeikoS	and the examples are executed
@HeikoS	it shows runtime on the bottom
@HeikoS	But the example obviously is too long for the main text
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah - its better actually this way
@HeikoS	I wonder how they maintain the main text code snippets
@HeikoS	they are more like our API examples
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is srini a potential mentor?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
@HeikoS	but he will not join now I am sure
@HeikoS	this annoys him
@HeikoS	I know that from last year when I tried to convince him
@lisitsyn	what annoys?
@HeikoS	and its always the same
@HeikoS	"no documentation", "unable to install"
@HeikoS	for years now
@lisitsyn	oh I see
@HeikoS	he wanted to check the NNs we have
@HeikoS	but no list
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@120.59.231.218] has joined #shogun
@lambday	HeikoS: is it a good idea to use doxygen?
@HeikoS	lambday: not sure
@HeikoS	lets discuss
@lambday	HeikoS: I don't have much exp on that
@lambday	kevin is the guy
@HeikoS	lambday, lisitsyn lets brainstorm a bit and solve this conceptually
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you  mentioned this sphinx
@lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can this help us?
@lisitsyn	because sphinx looks cool
@lisitsyn	:D
@lambday	lisitsyn: any example sites?
@lisitsyn	hmm yes
@lisitsyn	lambday: http://yelp.github.io/MOE/
@lambday	lisitsyn: hah niccee
@HeikoS	it for sure looks cooler than doxygen
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so if we used that, do we then only use doxygen for class documentation?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think it can do something on that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: examples?
@lisitsyn	let me search
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday in any case, *how* we do things is not so important in my eyes, just distracting. Questions is *how* we document
@HeikoS	and how we make it happen
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: sphinx http://docs.opencv.org/
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can we generate this from our current source code docs?
@lisitsyn	no idea
@lisitsyn	have to check
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: next thing that would be cool
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/tree/master
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	if we could use the github md editor to write documentation
@HeikoS	but then they somehow get linked back
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	on top of doxygen
@HeikoS	exactly
@HeikoS	so what are the goals we aim to get?
@lisitsyn	ok I have no idea now
@HeikoS	1. We clone this http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
@HeikoS	structure wise
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	list of machines
@HeikoS	2. All the code snippets in there come from meta language examples, every code snippet has a header where one can switch the modular target
@HeikoS	so in this documentation, one can switch language easily
@HeikoS	the code snippets are mostly API examples and to illustrate
@HeikoS	we can use doxygens (or other) ability to only show snippets from a larger code file, text can be written around it
-!- drawert [c65b040e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.198.91.4.14] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	3. There are pictures with output of more complex examples
@HeikoS	like in scikit docs, we can use python for the plots, too
@HeikoS	which means we need plotting code in python
@HeikoS	but still would be cool to swap language in the longer examples
@HeikoS	If we have this and manage to populate it, we will be the greatest ;)
@HeikoS	4. It is able to populate this via the github wiki editor
@HeikoS	(which might be challenging in practice)
@HeikoS	No need to have this
@HeikoS	we can use md files
@HeikoS	so Questions:
@lambday	markdown parsers can be used there
@HeikoS	what does that mean?
@lambday	oh but then we won't be able to edit from github wiki
@HeikoS	Maybe its fine
@HeikoS	Question is: which system should we use to write these pages
@HeikoS	It needs:
@HeikoS	markdown support
@HeikoS	able to put in snippets of code, that are somehow marked in example files
@HeikoS	second:
@HeikoS	we only want to write the doc entry *once*
@HeikoS	and reference snippets that were marked in the meta language example
@HeikoS	and the system then generates a listing box with the links for changing language
@HeikoS	first point works with doxygen
@HeikoS	second does not really
@HeikoS	could make this work via jinja
@HeikoS	but the problem then is
@HeikoS	that the system gets messy to use
@HeikoS	which means nobody will use it
@HeikoS	so what to do there?
@HeikoS	write a little mini framework that does this?
@HeikoS	we can start from here:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
@HeikoS	so if in there, we would put
@HeikoS	\snippet classifier_libsvm_probabilities.sg headers
@HeikoS	and then use some grep/jinja magic to replace the .sg with the automatically generated listings
@HeikoS	then we would get multiple pages
@HeikoS	but doxygen does not offer a nice way to switch
@HeikoS	we need some kind of bar in the top of the page that globally selects target language
* HeikoS spams
@lambday	HeikoS: why globally
@HeikoS	lambday: imagine someone only wants to look at octave
-!- pickle27 [~pickle27@192-0-134-235.cpe.teksavvy.com] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	he doesnt want to click octave for any listing
@HeikoS	pickle27: hi!
@HeikoS	pickle27: read the logs of the last 30 mins, some good idea going on here, and we need your help :)
 pickle27	hey
@lambday	oh yeah that makes sense
 pickle27	can you give me a tldr?
 pickle27	I just got back from 2 week vacay
@HeikoS	pickle27: yes
@HeikoS	oh haha :)
 pickle27	and I am catching up on everything
@HeikoS	pickle27: Ill write it up later
@HeikoS	pickle27: and share
@HeikoS	lambday: so if we use jinja to create multiple doxygen sites
@HeikoS	that would be possible
 pickle27	thanks
@HeikoS	there is some root where one can select language
@HeikoS	and then comes to the generated sites
@lambday	HeikoS: multiple static html pages??
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe?
@HeikoS	lambday: would at least work
@HeikoS	lambday: but not pretty right?
@lambday	umm nah there must be a better way
@HeikoS	lambday: are there maybe some markdown objects that can do such things?
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	so doxygen can only generate static htmlk
@HeikoS	html
@lambday	yep
@HeikoS	we would need dynamically generated sites then
@HeikoS	now my expertise ends
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	:(
@lambday	lisitsyn: sphinx does that?
@lisitsyn	why dynamic?
@lisitsyn	sphinx is as static
@lambday	pickle27 is the guy :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: for that language switching business
@HeikoS	pickle27: ok let me summarise now
@HeikoS	would be cool to get your input
 pickle27	kk
@lambday	lisitsyn: imagine we support 10 languages.. do we really wanna generate 10 static html pages for that?
@lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	pickle27: so we want to clone this: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	there are two types of code listings in there, snippets and full examples if you click on the pictures
@HeikoS	we want the same for shogun
@lambday	lisitsyn: lol :D
@HeikoS	but there should be some bar at the top, where one can change the language of the snippets
@HeikoS	pickle27: since the meta language project is done, that is possible
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: dynamic like javascript?
 pickle27	cool
@lisitsyn	or what?
 pickle27	web wise its pretty straight forward
@HeikoS	pickle27: but how to do the website, what system to ouse?
@HeikoS	we want to be able to write *one* md page per method
 pickle27	you could do it a lot of different ways
@HeikoS	and then somehow reference snippets from the example in the meta language
@HeikoS	and then based on the user selection, the snippets are pasted from the different target listing
@HeikoS	pickle27: has to be easy to use, too, so something like this
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
 pickle27	I like where lisitsyn was going with statically generating it
@HeikoS	pickle27: so this gist shows how to do it in doxygen for a fixed language
 pickle27	then we can't break it :p
@lisitsyn	just generate all the stuff
@HeikoS	then we could use doxygen
-!- xAndreLopesx [b194c420@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.177.148.196.32] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	just need to generate all the doxypages and replace the source code of the snippet
@lisitsyn	sorry guys heading home
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: bye
@HeikoS	pickle27: so what do you think?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: will you be online in 2 hrs?
 pickle27	yeah sounds good
@HeikoS	is the gist the way to go? along with some mechanism to create copies of the doxypage with the listing filename chnaged?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe
@lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: depends on whether I go climbing :)
@lisitsyn	lets update this
@lisitsyn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_(toolbox)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: go for it :)
@lisitsyn	lets make it huge
@lisitsyn	ok
 pickle27	doxygen is kind of old school
@HeikoS	pickle27: suggestions?
@lisitsyn	sphinx!
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	pickle27: cool thing:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
 pickle27	what about jekyll
@HeikoS	this is just an md file
 pickle27	http://jekyllrb.com/
@HeikoS	so as long as these things work:
@HeikoS	"\snippet classifier_libsvm_probabilities.cpp headers"
@HeikoS	we are fine
 pickle27	and we can host on github
@lisitsyn	pickle27: but it doesn't scan all the classes
@lisitsyn	for their doc
@HeikoS	keep in mind this is not class docs
@lisitsyn	we still need to have class reference
@HeikoS	they can stay doxygen for now
@HeikoS	we want a manual
@lisitsyn	a manual is sphinx or jekyll
@HeikoS	that is not this here: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/python_modular_examples.html
@lisitsyn	no other sane way
 pickle27	yeah if we want class links then doxygen works
 pickle27	I was thinking this was more of a curated example set kind of like the notebooks etc
@HeikoS	yeah like the scikit
@HeikoS	pickle27, lisitsyn so whats different between jekyll or sphinx
@HeikoS	pickle27: what does this hosting on gitub imply?
 pickle27	jekyll takes plain text and makes a static site
@HeikoS	how would the gist example look in jekyll?
 pickle27	github can host a static page for you from a repo
 pickle27	I am not sure I'd have to look into it
 pickle27	then when you push to the repo the site updates
@HeikoS	pickle27: ah thats amazin
 pickle27	yeah it is quite nice
 pickle27	but you can only write html and javascript they can't run anything else
@HeikoS	pickle27: is that a problem?
 pickle27	I think what might be best is to put some kind of post process after doxygen
 pickle27	HeikoS: not really for the docs but for the main site we run some stuff background wise
 pickle27	I was thinking about how we might do our whole site from github pages
 pickle27	that is what a lot of web open source projects do
 pickle27	but yeah maybe jekyll on top of doxygen
 pickle27	jekyll can add javascript and styles etc to the doxygen base
@HeikoS	pickle27: so you would keep doxygen for the manual?
@HeikoS	thing is I want to avoid doing something that we cannot use if we switch the system
 pickle27	keep doygen for generating the plain html from the source code and then post process in jeykll to make it look better
 pickle27	I dunno I am brain dumping here
@HeikoS	cool thing here is that this is just md, https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
@HeikoS	any system that can parse this and generate a static page is fine
@HeikoS	and we generate multiple of them via post-processing with jinja
 pickle27	yeah that works too
@HeikoS	and that can be postprocessed then
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	one thing
@HeikoS	pickle27: it would be amazing to have like a header bar where use can select the language
 pickle27	so if that works we just need to host it and add styles?
@HeikoS	check here
@HeikoS	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	they have this thing to remove the <<< from the python snippet
@HeikoS	something like that for all languages, but maybe globally
@HeikoS	so all snippets change
 pickle27	yeah so what I would do there is include all the languages in the md file
 pickle27	and somehow make it generate them in different divs
 pickle27	then do something like this
 pickle27	http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
-!- abinashm [uid66179@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-dgstmgfmchomthlq] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	pickle27: these tabs you mean?
 pickle27	yeah
@HeikoS	pickle27: thing is
 pickle27	we can re-style them
@HeikoS	imagine a user wants to have octave
@HeikoS	he doesnt want to press on octave button on each snippet
@HeikoS	just once
@HeikoS	so thats why like a header or so with these would be cool
 pickle27	sure we can js a global bar
 pickle27	thats easy to do
@HeikoS	and that would change the static html site?
 pickle27	what we need is to have each language in a div with the id or class set to the language
@HeikoS	pickle27: multiple files not good?
 pickle27	then we write a bit of javascript that we include on the page
@HeikoS	pickle27: would be in fact easier
@HeikoS	remember the developers have to write this here:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
 pickle27	we use javascript to control which div is visible is all
@HeikoS	in there I would just put
@HeikoS	\snippet classifier_libsvm_probabilities.cpp headers
@HeikoS	with .sg instead of cpp
@HeikoS	and then postprocessing does the rest
 pickle27	yeah post process would need to include every language file
 pickle27	so we can say what is visible
@HeikoS	if we have to put all the stuff in there, that might be messy?
 pickle27	for a static site
 pickle27	nah I dont think so
@HeikoS	but the file itself is markdown
@HeikoS	how to put all listings in there?
@HeikoS	but actually better as only one copy of the file
@HeikoS	how does the div thing work?
@HeikoS	how would it look like?
-!- drawert [c65b040e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.198.91.4.14] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@lambday	it would just hide other language ids
 pickle27	this ^
 pickle27	we need to load all content and then control visibility
 pickle27	I would say we write some sort of macro for whatever processes the md files to automatically include all the languages
@lambday	we can have a script to generate different divs with different ids for different langs
@HeikoS	I dont know this thing, could you paste an example?
 pickle27	errr one sec
 pickle27	it would look like this http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0K176S9
@HeikoS	I meant more the code
@HeikoS	how the file with all content would look like
 pickle27	yup working on it
@HeikoS	ah ok
@HeikoS	thanks
@HeikoS	what should I look at at this page?
 pickle27	here
 pickle27	http://pastebin.com/ucdRWrrn
@HeikoS	pickle27: and the postprocessed doxygen file?
 pickle27	thats the html we need in the end
@HeikoS	but I still dont get one thing
@HeikoS	are there multiple html files?
@HeikoS	or just one?
@lambday	for each example you have one
 pickle27	kinda depends how we lay it out
 pickle27	I would agree with lambday one file for each example
 pickle27	we can concat them later if they are all on one page and use them as partials
@HeikoS	so how does the pipeline go
@HeikoS	we start here
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/97cee3b334bf78d69466
@HeikoS	this is the md file
-!- hiii [74ca656a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.116.202.101.106] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	then a script runs over it and replaces *.sg with all the listings
@HeikoS	that we have
 pickle27	yeah something like that
@HeikoS	so then we have multiple of those md files
@HeikoS	each of which with a different snippet listing filename
@HeikoS	doxygen generates static html pages for each of them
@HeikoS	We have a set of html files
 pickle27	yeah unless we can generate the original md file too
@HeikoS	those are then put into the tab by the js code you sent
@HeikoS	what do you mean generate the original md file?
 pickle27	like if we want to do this for all examples then we could put the text in the .sg file and extract it
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	I kind of dont want to do that
@HeikoS	Would like to have a seperate set of examples just for the manual
@HeikoS	and then longer examples (the ones we currently have) that generate a plot or so
 pickle27	or we could still put the code in the .sg and then have a whitelist for the manual
@HeikoS	and then distributing the exisitng examples into that categoriy
@HeikoS	how do you mean?
@HeikoS	I think the end goal is to have a site like the scikit one
@HeikoS	and the entries are hand-crafted
@HeikoS	or
@HeikoS	what about this:
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	maybe the sg file contains the markdown code at the beginning to have things together?
@lambday	do wew need to generate multiple md files?
@HeikoS	But I think thats not so nice
@HeikoS	rather write the manual entries by hand
@HeikoS	quickly summarise what the method does
@HeikoS	give some mini snippets how to use it
@HeikoS	not a while example file, thats the point
@HeikoS	just a selection of some code (that is though executable to maintain)
@lambday	just the snippet part should be copied ands pasted over the same md ... then some div magic
 pickle27	ah okay gotcha
 pickle27	didn't realize the snippets were not the examples
 pickle27	yeah I think we have the overall idea nailed out
@HeikoS	pickle27: idea is to have markers in the .sg file
@HeikoS	see the gist I sent
@HeikoS	second file
@HeikoS	and then reference that from the manual text
 pickle27	yeah I think this will work
@HeikoS	pickle27, lambday one more thing I would like to ask you about
@HeikoS	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	there are these plots
@HeikoS	and one can click to get the code that generated the plot
@HeikoS	this is different to the snippets
@HeikoS	It would be cool to have something similar
@HeikoS	but how to do?
@HeikoS	since plots can only be done in python
 pickle27	I would just link to a python script then
 pickle27	or plot in something else for the manual
 pickle27	like d3 / nvd3
 pickle27	and just output json from the snippet
 pickle27	probably best to stick with python and link to the single script though
@HeikoS	the scikit people have two things per method
@HeikoS	1. snippet 2. long example that generates plot
@HeikoS	= more work than one
@HeikoS	but maybe best way
@HeikoS	long example can be python
@HeikoS	have to use that for the plot anyways
@HeikoS	snippets are multiple languages
 pickle27	I think that makes sense
@HeikoS	any idea how to get the image in  in a systematic way?
-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@182.70.232.149] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	so we now have written the doxypage in md
@HeikoS	at some point, we put like
@HeikoS	argh
@HeikoS	irc commands
@HeikoS	a line like
@HeikoS	exampleimage     log_regression.py
@HeikoS	with a slash in front
@HeikoS	that could be in the md
@HeikoS	and then somehow, the picture gets included
@HeikoS	or, we just refer to notebook?
 pickle27	yeah something like that could work
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	seems messy
@HeikoS	the scikit people have these example sections
@HeikoS	http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	bullet points with examples
 pickle27	yeah loading images by path is a bit messy but there isn't really another way
 pickle27	we just need to ensure that the images get made properly
@HeikoS	that leads to a page which contains the plot and the script output and the sourcce code below
@HeikoS	and they then just include that same plot in the manual itself
@HeikoS	mmmh
@HeikoS	maybe that can be done later
@HeikoS	could be added after first thing is working
@HeikoS	right? should be possible to extend somehow
 pickle27	I actually have to run, let me know what you come up with and I can happily help review etc but no time to work on it myself
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	Ill try to set up a prototype
 pickle27	all my shogun time needs to go to the website v2
 pickle27	later!
@HeikoS	yeah :)
@HeikoS	bye!
@HeikoS	lambday: still there?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@lambday	finished dinner in between :D
@HeikoS	what if there were no pictures at the manual for now
@HeikoS	hewhe :)
@HeikoS	what did you ahve?
@lambday	HeikoS: Indian :D and not the spicy things people assume :D
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah it can be done later.. but would be better if we think about it before hand
@HeikoS	I like indian food
@HeikoS	I agree
@HeikoS	I like to think from the perspective of the person a) reading it and b) writing the manual entry
@lambday	HeikoS: I'm am not getting how multiple md files can be parsed into one html by doxygen..
@HeikoS	so from a) we definitely need pictures
@HeikoS	lambday: I think we would have to have mutliple static html files
@HeikoS	and then pickle27 s js magic deals with them somehow
@lambday	HeikoS: but also duplicating the text surrounding to the snippets?
@lambday	they get copied too?
@HeikoS	I guess yes
@HeikoS	doxygen can only process the md files themselves
@HeikoS	or maybe put all snippets?
@HeikoS	and then they get cut out
@HeikoS	but I dont know to make doxygen do that
@HeikoS	like the static version more as I understand it :)
@HeikoS	and if no js is available this still works
@HeikoS	and one has clean single sites, not a big one with everything
@lambday	hehe..but hiding thing is cool...
@lambday	drop down menus work similarly I assume
@HeikoS	any idea how to make doxygen output html that can be postprocessed in this way?
@lambday	they have all the text there itself.. they just hide certain parts
@HeikoS	I see
@lambday	nada
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@120.59.231.218] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
@lambday	the reason you want doxygen is because of its md parsing capability
@lambday	I didn't understand how postprocessing would work though
@HeikoS	in the gist
@HeikoS	postprocessing creates a number of copies of the md file
@HeikoS	each of which contains *.py rather than *.sg
@lambday	nah I meant to say - once doxygen generates the static html.. after that what?
@lambday	isn't it possible to tell doxygen to create some predefined snippet with some spcific id/class
@lambday	I meant to say - you have this md file ... then a post processing script copies and pastes the snippet over and over for all the languages.. and somehow doxygen/something else is instructed to generate different divs with those snippets.. different ids/class
@lambday	then with one html you have it all - text just once.. just the appropriate snippet shown for selected lang
@lambday	each example one html
@lambday	js can take care of hiding
@HeikoS	yeah in this view I meant, there is one html per target language
@HeikoS	in yours, there is one html file with all listings
@HeikoS	and then some are hidden
@HeikoS	which is way nicer
@lambday	HeikoS: I don't know what to use technically to achieve this - but should be possible
@HeikoS	lambday: I dont think doxygen can do this
@HeikoS	but it would be awesome right
@HeikoS	?
@lambday	if we have different htmls.. then the links has to be taken care of as well
@lambday	yeah
@lambday	switching language idea is a killer :D
@HeikoS	hehe :)
@HeikoS	so what about this:
@HeikoS	postprocessing generates all these html files
 xAndreLopesx	hi
@HeikoS	and then post - postprocessing merges them into one
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: Hi!
 xAndreLopesx	im reading the chat log... you guys are working on javadoc and other lkanguages doc?
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: doxygen
 xAndreLopesx	awesome!
 xAndreLopesx	so yes, right?
@HeikoS	we want to build a clone of http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	but with shogun
@HeikoS	and with a 1-click way of changing the code language
 xAndreLopesx	oh
 xAndreLopesx	i thought you guys were talking about docs
 xAndreLopesx	:P
@HeikoS	yeah we do
@HeikoS	thats docs
 xAndreLopesx	ah
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: have a read through the last hour ;)
@lambday	post post processing haha :D
 xAndreLopesx	the last hour was erased
 xAndreLopesx	i have just partial log
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: its in the channel logs
 xAndreLopesx	im using kiwi irc
 xAndreLopesx	ah
 xAndreLopesx	ok
@HeikoS	http://bit.ly/1eBecWl
@lambday	xAndreLopesx: http://bit.ly/1eBecWl
@HeikoS	lambday: thats possible right?
 xAndreLopesx	javadoc S2
@HeikoS	since we can look for the html output of doxygen that starts a snippet
@HeikoS	and then replace with this div thing of all languages
@HeikoS	though not clean
@lambday	HeikoS: hehe yeah.. have some way to tell code part from the snippet part in the html
@HeikoS	lambday: its possible but hacky
@HeikoS	so not nice
@HeikoS	lets assume we do multiple static html files for now
@HeikoS	and the header just causes the system to load the appropriate ones
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah that's technically possible
@HeikoS	so fine
@HeikoS	so we have sorted a) from above
@HeikoS	what about the pictures
@HeikoS	so there we could link to generated images from the examples
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@59.177.199.201] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	but then we need to write things in python
@HeikoS	so we need two code files for each method
@HeikoS	one is just the snippet stuff, minimal
@HeikoS	the other one (optional) is the thing that generates the image
@HeikoS	and we generate pages like this http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html
@HeikoS	and then somehow put image+link in the main manual
@HeikoS	ok I will draft a prototype
@HeikoS	lets see where we get
@HeikoS	need a break now
@HeikoS	Ill put this into the wiki
@lambday	yeah.. we generate these images each make doc? or just statically have those images along-with the pyscripts
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. :D
@lambday	HeikoS: coffee?
@HeikoS	haha no I had enough, water :)

 xAndreLopesx	DoubleMatrix.loadAsciiFile requires the full path?
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: not sure, check jblas documentation
@HeikoS	I guess this is java?
-!- hiii [74ca656a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.116.202.101.106] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 xAndreLopesx	yes
 xAndreLopesx	its java
 xAndreLopesx	it seems it does use full path :(
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: annoying
@HeikoS	maybe open a bug report for jblas?
 xAndreLopesx	will do
@HeikoS	lambday: there is another question: still around?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah'
@HeikoS	have a look at
@HeikoS	say http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html
@HeikoS	they use toy data
@HeikoS	and its immediately clear what this consists of and in what format it is
@HeikoS	now our meta examples look like:
@lambday	HeikoS: synthetic data?
@lambday	oh no
@lambday	diabetes
@HeikoS	https://github.com/sorig/shogun/tree/develop/examples/example-generation
@HeikoS	they load files
@HeikoS	I wonder whether this is good for such documentation?
@HeikoS	see what I mean?
@HeikoS	and another thing
@lambday	HeikoS: umm no. I think while explaining a method, minimal importance should be given to the data... creates less confusion to the readers
@lambday	if that's what you mean
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	so you think loading files is ok?
@lambday	HeikoS: what alternative idea you have? generating small dataset in the program itself?
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	but thats not possible with meta language
@lambday	HeikoS: would loading be a problem for sg programs?
@lambday	i see
@lambday	generating data is not possible either
@lambday	unless its all shogun code
@lambday	but for python we use numpy etc for that
@HeikoS	generating would be if we added a class
 xAndreLopesx	Can i make a quick question?
 xAndreLopesx	perceptron.train(); I noticed it locks the thread.. How can i get the error rate?
 xAndreLopesx	And its possible to get the error rate during training ?
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: unfortuately not, but I think you can set a max number of iterations
 xAndreLopesx	even using C++ ?
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: the perceptron implementation we have is very crappy, it is not really useful, rather use another linear method, perceptron is not a good choice anyways
@HeikoS	though we need to clean this up
 xAndreLopesx	im just running the example..
 xAndreLopesx	ok
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: nope even in c++
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	the example should work
 xAndreLopesx	Going to try neural networks then. Im used to Encog.
 xAndreLopesx	Lets see what i dig, im new to shogun :)
@HeikoS	yeah go to NNs :)
@HeikoS	all new
@HeikoS	(and hopefully proper)
@HeikoS	svms all work for sure
@HeikoS	and super mature and stable
@lambday	HeikoS: added a class where?
@HeikoS	lambday: shogun c++ class to generate toy data
@HeikoS	but not really good, we can just load I agree
@lambday	HeikoS: oh.. yeah.. then meta can handle it
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. these are standard datasets right..
@lambday	if we can load then it would be good
@HeikoS	yep works
@HeikoS	Ill show you an exampl ein 10 secs
@lambday	wow :D
 xAndreLopesx	DynamicObjectArray :O
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/93062ce150158a9cea03
 xAndreLopesx	so DynamicObjectArray holds CSGObjects
 xAndreLopesx	right?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	so any shogun object
@lambday	oh yeah we have files :D
@HeikoS	with reference counting
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: in java you dont need that
 xAndreLopesx	The ANN is asking for DynamicObjectArray as a parameter or nothing at all
 xAndreLopesx	im not sure whats the method to add layers and neurons :O
@HeikoS	Ah
@HeikoS	Ok so create one :)
 xAndreLopesx	There is this
 xAndreLopesx	set_layers(DynamicObjectArray doa)
@HeikoS	methods are documented here:
 xAndreLopesx	http://shogun.ml/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CSGObject.html
 xAndreLopesx	this page, right?
@HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CDynamicObjectArray.html
@HeikoS	yeah
 xAndreLopesx	so this DOA will hold the layers, right?
 xAndreLopesx	:P
 xAndreLopesx	got it
 xAndreLopesx	yay its not so jhard after all :P
@HeikoS	check the notebooks on NNs
@HeikoS	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook/
@HeikoS	same syntax when you use Java
 xAndreLopesx	thats way better :)
@lambday	lol I remember when I came here for the first time :D
@HeikoS	lambday: hehe how was it?
@lambday	HeikoS: I guess you answered my queries there as well :D
@lambday	I wanted to implement a string kernel using shogun
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	thats on stack overflow right?
@lisitsyn	hola
@lambday	HeikoS: its not in shogun as well :D
@lambday	lisitsyn: hola amigo
@lisitsyn	so
@lambday	oops it *is* in shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its all solved
@HeikoS	see our website
@lisitsyn	really?
@lisitsyn	what
@HeikoS	lambday: wrote all examples in 2 hrs
@HeikoS	magic script
@lisitsyn	what solved?
@HeikoS	we now have a manual
@lambday	HeikoS: whoa!!
@lisitsyn	where?
@HeikoS	www.distant_future.com
@lambday	lisitsyn: lol you missed the show :D
@lisitsyn	ohhh english humour
@lisitsyn	ohkay
@lambday	I got to understand how this meta language works!
@HeikoS	I am prototyping
@HeikoS	but gotta go soon
@lambday	HeikoS: trekking?
@HeikoS	climbing :)
@lambday	oh but in london it must be 7
@lambday	niceee!
 xAndreLopesx	shogun is implemented in C++ right?
@lambday	yessir
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah it is
@HeikoS	late
 xAndreLopesx	where is the activationFunctions :O
@HeikoS	xAndreLopesx: C++11 rules!
@lisitsyn	auto auto = auto();
@lisitsyn	that's my favourite program in C++24

@lambday	lisitsyn: lol
@lisitsyn	lambday: you've got to use mvalue
@lambday	xAndreLopesx: haha :D
 xAndreLopesx	I have seen it in my nightmares
 xAndreLopesx	robots coming from the sky.
@lisitsyn	after introducing rvalues in addition to lvalues
@lisitsyn	they added mvalue
@lisitsyn	this is meta-transcendent value of horror
@lisitsyn	it does some kind of random type inference
@lisitsyn	it is quite simple when you realize it is a functor on top of that Strathmann manifold
@lambday	hahahaha :D
@lambday	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	hahaha
@HeikoS	Strathmanian manifold
@lisitsyn	Strathmanian is a determinant of third order curvature matrix of Strathmann manifold
@HeikoS	how can I make doxygen produce output when I have only one input file?
@lisitsyn	see Strathmann 2019
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it can only work on two files
@HeikoS	hehe
@lambday	you're on the roll :D
@HeikoS	doesnt produce anything
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok I stop :D
@lisitsyn	what's the problem?
@HeikoS	ls
@HeikoS	Doxyfile_en.inDoxyfile_en.in~  html  knn.md  knn.md~knn.sglatex
@lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	doxygen Doxyfile_en.in . html
@HeikoS	the index.html is empty
@HeikoS	# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
@HeikoS	# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you are welcome! ;)
@lisitsyn	so helpful I am
@HeikoS	indeed
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you just try to explain me a problem until you realize how to solve it
@lisitsyn	the dummy listener method
@lambday	HeikoS: how does the html look?
@HeikoS	empty
@HeikoS	need to put code
@HeikoS	just trying
@lambday	umm I thought it worked :D
@lisitsyn	tldr
@lisitsyn	what you decide?
@HeikoS	just a sec
@HeikoS	almost done
@HeikoS	ok
@lambday	md like HeikoS has --> script to generate multiple such mds for each supported lang --> pass it to doxygen --> generate static htmls ---> [optional] merge them together to hide these snippets under some div with different id/class ---> use js to hide the rest of the snippets except for the currently selected one
@HeikoS	now one more thing
@lambday	whoa this itself is tl
@lisitsyn	good
@lisitsyn	now I understand

 xAndreLopesx	im not sure what are labels in shogun
 xAndreLopesx	@lisitsyn
@lisitsyn	xAndreLopesx: labels are target variables like class or probability
 xAndreLopesx	i never used them on ANN's
 xAndreLopesx	im a bit confused :(
@lisitsyn	xAndreLopesx: well you probably want to predict something? ;)
 xAndreLopesx	yes
 xAndreLopesx	im making a stupid input-sum with 1 output
@lisitsyn	when you train labels contain what you want to get
 xAndreLopesx	ah
 xAndreLopesx	so the labels are just the result i expect?
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	and the result you get as well
 xAndreLopesx	got it
@lisitsyn	when you classify some data you also get labels
 xAndreLopesx	for clustering, correct?
 xAndreLopesx	or SOM?
