@wiking	why do you use still 3.1.1 version?
@wiking	why not 4.0.0?
 nileshK	yeah, I was unable to compile
 nileshK	the 4.0.0 version
 nileshK	I was getting some compilation with qsort something
 nileshK	I got this version on the quickstart guide.
 nileshK	I want a version of Shogun where I can easily get LpBoost working
 nileshK	I have just been able to get the minimal part running

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@lisitsyn	can I help with that stuff?
@lisitsyn	need some guidance to dive in
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	I need help! :=)
@HeikoS	Want to get some intro?
@HeikoS	this is about hackinh sphinx
@HeikoS	I can tell you where I am
@lisitsyn	yes please
@HeikoS	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/1NmjM50DtMA
@HeikoS	so
@HeikoS	sphinx can do templates
@HeikoS	see this one:
@HeikoS	https://github.com/karlnapf/shogun_manual/commit/518a5204f687472156e12bca3628b2bd55f97c4c
@HeikoS	the page.html is used to render the pages
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok so you need a jinja
@HeikoS	as you can see, its quite easy to put the things in there
@HeikoS	sphinx is based in jinja
@lisitsyn	to render a page that supports switching langs
@HeikoS	no sphinx can do all that
@HeikoS	if the {{body_python}} was defined
@HeikoS	then we would be done
@HeikoS	but one can only call {{body}} currently
@lisitsyn	oh
@HeikoS	understand?
@lisitsyn	where body_python comes from?
@HeikoS	I put it
@HeikoS	by hand
@HeikoS	the remplate wont change its used for all sites
@HeikoS	so quite nice
@HeikoS	we just need to create the corresponding body
@HeikoS	now
@lisitsyn	hmm I'd avoid that
@lisitsyn	why not to have some 'bodies'
@lisitsyn	and iterate over that?
@HeikoS	that doesnt matter its a detail
@HeikoS	not important now
@HeikoS	this is just straight jinja2 templating
@HeikoS	the problem is a different one
@lisitsyn	seems important as while we have body_* we can't iterate over that
@lisitsyn	ok then
@lisitsyn	I don't get the problem ;)
@lisitsyn	what's it?
@HeikoS	i did not tell you yet
@lisitsyn	oh ok :)
@HeikoS	do you have sphinx installed?
@lisitsyn	can install that
@HeikoS	open sphinx.builders.html.py
@lisitsyn	where?
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/karlnapf/shogun_manual
@lisitsyn	here?
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	just plain sphinx
@HeikoS	need to dive into its source code
@lisitsyn	uhm
@HeikoS	as not properly documented
@lisitsyn	I am not sure I have such a file
@HeikoS	it comes with spinx
@lisitsyn	oh sorry
@HeikoS	got it?
@lisitsyn	I brewed wrong sphinx
@HeikoS	let me know once you have it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: a sec
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay I am here
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	so where the body is created is the function write_doc
@HeikoS	def write_doc(self, docname, doctree):
@HeikoS	see it?
@HeikoS	now see here:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/d231d9d5587671645e73
@HeikoS	I added some functions to it
@HeikoS	that manipulate the doctree, replace language specific parts, and then puts multiple "body" fields into the context dictionary
@HeikoS	so far so good
@HeikoS	but the problem is: the doctree already contains the parsed sphinx .rst file
@lisitsyn	okay I found write_doc
@HeikoS	the function bascially takes the document tree representation, and produces the html
@HeikoS	handle_page call at the end adds it
@HeikoS	and ctx is a dictionary with the template arguments that will be replaced via jinja2
@HeikoS	so ctx['body'] containts the html code that one can put in with {{body}} in the page.html
@HeikoS	get it?
@lisitsyn	yeah probably
@HeikoS	ok
@lisitsyn	I need some explanation what .rst is
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	see here:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/b97c4a07fcbd99595496
@HeikoS	its the way to write the page
@HeikoS	its where the code listings are included
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah you have to look at raw
@HeikoS	https://gist.githubusercontent.com/karlnapf/b97c4a07fcbd99595496/raw/a85f1dc49dfd88614b892c45c9941b3e713df8b0/knn.rst
@lisitsyn	looks like markdown
@lisitsyn	similar to
@HeikoS	its super similar
@HeikoS	its a superset though
@lisitsyn	alright
@lisitsyn	it it transformed to html
@lisitsyn	it is*
@lisitsyn	right?
@HeikoS	so now this literalinclude thing is transformed to syntax tree
@HeikoS	then syntax tree is put into body
@HeikoS	I already know how to put in multiple body fields
@HeikoS	but they are all based on the syntax tree which already contains the parsed python code
@HeikoS	so need access to the function that parses
@HeikoS	once we have that, its done
@HeikoS	somehow combine all
@HeikoS	so if you could check whether you can hack this thing to that the ctx dictionary in write_doc contains "body_python"
@HeikoS	then all good
@HeikoS	its inserted into the template then
@HeikoS	and the page already works I have it running here locally
@HeikoS	which is cool as only a single sphinx make html produces all languages
@HeikoS	then just need to do some finetuning, but not important for now
@HeikoS	important is to get the syntax tree for the different files
@lisitsyn	ok I think I understand
@HeikoS	check this thing, it contains the way to add body_python etc
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/d231d9d5587671645e73
@lisitsyn	ah so you patched sphinx to do that
@HeikoS	but since the function receives the doctree as input (already parsed), it might not work this way
@HeikoS	one can also write sphinx extensions:
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extensions.html#extensions
@HeikoS	I think that might be the cleaner way
@HeikoS	we can then just define our own .rst command
@HeikoS	and then simply iterate
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: check this
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/tutorial.html
@HeikoS	might be the way
@lisitsyn	yeah looks like
@lisitsyn	need to glance over it a bit
@HeikoS	somehow overload the :literalinclude
@HeikoS	new command
@HeikoS	:shoguninclude
@HeikoS	where the python code calls the :literalinclude
@HeikoS	but I think we also need to mofy the html builder to include multiple body fields
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw the code I sent in gist is not patching sphinx
@HeikoS	one can overload the class and tell sphinx to use it
@HeikoS	so thats fine
@lisitsyn	can we write :ourownliteralinclude?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I guess :ourownliteralinclude would just concatenate multiple :literalinclude
@lisitsyn	it seems that we shouldn't multiply boides
@lisitsyn	bodies*
@lisitsyn	but just create a tab for each lang
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: can this command be defined with jinja?
@HeikoS	which command
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: currently we have global tabs
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: myliteralinclude
@HeikoS	with a single body, tabs have to be local
@HeikoS	which is fine
@lisitsyn	as wiking I like tabs just right to code more
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I dont know, but I dont think thats the idea
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well I was just going for easiest
@HeikoS	I think global is better in fact
@HeikoS	user doesnt want to change locally for every snippet
@HeikoS	but only once
@lisitsyn	no
@HeikoS	but thats super easy to do with template
@lisitsyn	we put it to parameter
@HeikoS	yeah
@lisitsyn	&lang=py
@HeikoS	but thats all not important
@HeikoS	as its so easy to change
@lisitsyn	once selected
@HeikoS	meat is in this problem here
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: can we define a command :myinclude that is rendered by jinja template?
@HeikoS	so then your :shoguninclude would create the html tabs
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I dont think it works that way
@HeikoS	have a look at
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_directive
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: more this:
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/index.html#dev-extensions
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it all works via nodes and python code
@HeikoS	so quite flexible
@HeikoS	one can iterate over all parameters
@HeikoS	we could do:
@HeikoS	.. shogun:: examples/knn
@HeikoS	  :start-after: ![load_data]
@HeikoS	  :end-before: ![load_data]
@lisitsyn	yes I think that's the idea
@HeikoS	which then iterates over all languages and calls the same code as in :literalinclude
@HeikoS	so why need jinja here?
@lisitsyn	hmmm how do we define
@lisitsyn	how it is being rendered
@lisitsyn	if it is just in body?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: in other words
@lisitsyn	say you have this shogun directive
@lisitsyn	it loads all examples/knn.[lang]
@lisitsyn	right?

@HeikoS	BuilderThe builder object (usually called builder) is an instance of a specific subclass of Builder. Each builder class knows how to convert the parsed documents into an output format, or otherwise process them (e.g. check external links).If you have the application object, the builder is available as app.builder.
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@lisitsyn	ok then where is the format is defined?
@HeikoS	the builder thing would then do the tabbing
@HeikoS	Builder
@lisitsyn	ohh
@lisitsyn	complex thing
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	is there a jinja builder?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no need
@lisitsyn	how do we write html then?
@HeikoS	you have python
@HeikoS	you overload some methods
@HeikoS	write_doc method
@HeikoS	dont think thats a lot of work
@HeikoS	OR
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	just overload
@lisitsyn	ok theeen
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: wanna have a go on this?
@lisitsyn	yes want to try
@HeikoS	Ill have dinner now but would be back in an hour or so to help?
@HeikoS	I want to tackle this today! :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok I'll try just now
@HeikoS	how long are you staying? :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: for some random time
@lisitsyn	gf could force me to talk
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	but I can continue tomorrow anyway
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok
@HeikoS	well ill have a look on the chat
@HeikoS	share whatever you got
@HeikoS	Ill work a bit more on it later
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I just need a way to generate that stuff
@lisitsyn	is cloning your repo enough?
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	do
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sphinx-quickstart
@HeikoS	and then copy the knn.rst in
@HeikoS	Ill add cource of the python and octave
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where to call sphinx-quickstart?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any dir
@HeikoS	and then populate with those files here:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/b97c4a07fcbd99595496
@HeikoS	the html go to source/_templates
@HeikoS	the .rst go to source
@HeikoS	and the examples to any folder of choice (matching the knn.rst)
@lisitsyn	ohh
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good?
@lisitsyn	okay
@lisitsyn	yes I think I got it
@HeikoS	its just a minimal working sphinx config
@HeikoS	and the layout.html adds the bootstrap javascript
@HeikoS	and the page.html contains the layout for the tabs
@HeikoS	if you want to activate the bootstrap tabs, then you have to run
@HeikoS	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
@HeikoS	and then navigate the the build/index.html
@lisitsyn	ok got it

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any progress?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: just set up this thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: shall we maybe synch
@HeikoS	sync?
@HeikoS	push to repo and then push incremental changes
@HeikoS	to see whats going on?
@HeikoS	or wanna stay in private?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: repo is better for sure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: wanna push?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah just a sec
@HeikoS	cool
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm I see just tabs
@lisitsyn	I guess something is b0rken
@HeikoS	that means the body twas not found
@HeikoS	do you have body_python ?
@lisitsyn	ah
@HeikoS	or just plain body?
@lisitsyn	plain
@HeikoS	no that should do it
@HeikoS	I can also set up example and push?
@HeikoS	maybe better?
@HeikoS	as I already got it working?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: would be better
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you want all the doc be in sphinx?
@HeikoS	yes for now
@HeikoS	about to push ...
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no I mean in general
@HeikoS	I dont care about this atm
@HeikoS	probably in doc/manual/
@HeikoS	I want this to be seperate from doxygen
@HeikoS	and then populate/experiment
@HeikoS	and then maybe at some point use it for class docs also
@lisitsyn	so doxygen stays for class reference?
@HeikoS	but no need to do that now
@HeikoS	can change later
@HeikoS	purpose is kind of different
@lisitsyn	just want to understand what you think
@HeikoS	but it would be cool to have a uniform design
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	this is an addition for now, so not replacing anything
@HeikoS	But I want to move *all* doxygen documentation that is not md-file or class docs to sphinx
@lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	md files come from doc submodule
@HeikoS	and class docs are fine for now
@HeikoS	serve purpose
@HeikoS	we should also add a :shogunclass directive
@HeikoS	that links against class docs for a class
@HeikoS	rather than using hard-links in the examples
@HeikoS	but let me push
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok
@HeikoS	clone it
@HeikoS	go to sphinx dir
@HeikoS	type make html
@HeikoS	and then python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
@HeikoS	then you will see the tabs
@lisitsyn	cool thanks
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: for now I left the global tabs
@HeikoS	but they all just include {{body}}
@HeikoS	see page.html
@HeikoS	lets try to write this extension together
@HeikoS	maybe for now clone the :literalinclude?
@HeikoS	and then modify?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok it works
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where literalinclude is defined?
@HeikoS	his is what you can do in an extension: First, you can add new builders to support new output formats or actions on the parsed documents. Then, it is possible to register custom reStructuredText roles and directives, extending the markup. And finally, there are so-called "hook points" at strategic places throughout the build process, where an extension can register a hook and run specialized code.
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/index.html#dev-extensions
@HeikoS	lets do this :
@HeikoS	http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/tutorial.html
@HeikoS	so we need this setup function first
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@120.59.75.255] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
@lisitsyn	hmm
@lisitsyn	looks simple lets try
@HeikoS	where does this file go?
@HeikoS	just python path?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am not sure
@lisitsyn	have the same question
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think source
@lisitsyn	conf.py is already here
@HeikoS	kk
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: lets just copy paste
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I added this thing
@lisitsyn	nothing happened
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	I think this todo.py adds directives
@HeikoS	in the conf.py we might be able to add the extension
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am not sure it is loaded
@HeikoS	extensions = [
@HeikoS	    'sphinx.ext.mathjax',
@HeikoS	    'todo'
@HeikoS	]
@HeikoS	in conf.py
@lisitsyn	ahhh
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	no module named todo
@HeikoS	move to makefile dir
@HeikoS	then youll get another error ;)
@HeikoS	got it?
@HeikoS	todolist not defined?
@HeikoS	they say in the tutorial: We need to create the two node classes todo and todolist later.
@lisitsyn	ah yeah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: then it just catches modules from currentpath + PYTHONPATH
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but thats fine
@lisitsyn	yeah more or less
@HeikoS	the thing can be in makefile dir
@HeikoS	or somewhere else
@lisitsyn	we just modify PYTHONPATH
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	ok so next step is to define the classes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: pythonpath again I guess
@HeikoS	I copied this to the same file
@HeikoS	to the beginning
@lisitsyn	yeah that' s good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but also doesnt work yet
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I put all the things below
@lisitsyn	works
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can you past your file in some gist?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  I get
@HeikoS	  File "/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_manual/sphinx/todo.py", line 4, in setup
@HeikoS	    app.add_node(todolist)
@HeikoS	NameError: global name 'todolist' is not defined
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: https://gist.github.com/lisitsyn/a885cd193a4b1b7fae79
@HeikoS	doesnt work
@HeikoS	sigh
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	my mistake
@HeikoS	works
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok then it is quite simple
@lisitsyn	following this example we can add shoguninclude thing
@HeikoS	did you try to use it?
@HeikoS	ill try
@lisitsyn	not yet
@HeikoS	dont get a todo list
@lisitsyn	yeah me too
@HeikoS	but dont know the syntax of the directive
@HeikoS	   .. todo:: asdasd
@HeikoS	   .. todo:: asdasd2
@HeikoS	   .. todolist
@HeikoS	I suggest we try to add tabs around the todolist :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: :todo_include_todos: true
@lisitsyn	according to http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/todo.html?highlight=todo#module-sphinx.ext.todo
@HeikoS	config?
@lisitsyn	yeah I guess
@lisitsyn	hmm still not
@HeikoS	I get lots of non existing references when building
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ha!
@lisitsyn	worked
@HeikoS	push!
@lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	and then we can add the tabs to the todo list
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: a second
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you have push rights
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: done
@lisitsyn	try that
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: use make preview
@lisitsyn	that's just make html and python -m thing
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	pulled
@lisitsyn	ok that's pretty straightforward
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: let me take care of this but tomorrow morning
@HeikoS	wanna stop?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: gf is waiting sorry :)
@HeikoS	no worries
@HeikoS	I might play a bit
@HeikoS	have a good night!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think that's the way to go
@lisitsyn	I guess sphinx people would suggest the same thing
@lisitsyn	ok see you tomorrow
@HeikoS	see you!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: still here?
@lisitsyn	https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge lets beat people on this small data
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: your GP expertise should rock here
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	would love to
@HeikoS	but time issues as usual
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: be my shogun consultant then
@HeikoS	sure :)
@lisitsyn	I love small data
@lisitsyn	building infinite dimensional models is like touching the god
@lisitsyn	so I start with kernel svm
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what kernel rocks for 0,1,2,...~40 counters?
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	uh thats discrete
@HeikoS	use Gaussian
@HeikoS	is it ordered?
@HeikoS	then Gaussian is fine
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Class_9
@lisitsyn	typisch vector
@HeikoS	use gaussian as a baseline
@HeikoS	will do good
@HeikoS	to me it seems sparse?
@HeikoS	actually
@HeikoS	try a linear model
@HeikoS	liblinear
@HeikoS	should do as well
@HeikoS	then compare to Gaussian
@HeikoS	then compare to random forest
@HeikoS	we need this supervised learning framework
@HeikoS	for shogun
@HeikoS	where all models are fitted, parameters learned automagically
@HeikoS	and then boosting or so learns the weights
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the more kaggle tries I do the better I understand how should it look liek
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I bet linear would not win here
@HeikoS	try
@HeikoS	baseline for sure
@lisitsyn	# features <<< # vectors
@lisitsyn	38 features
@lisitsyn	60K train examples
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: obviously more complex thing is possible
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: would this diffusion kernel rock here?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have been thinking about it as a panacea for such discrete features haha
@lisitsyn	they look very math :D
@HeikoS	the diffusion kernel is for unordered discrete data
@HeikoS	if you have an ordering its fine to embed into real space
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	but shogun doesnt have categorial feature representation that is good
@HeikoS	if we had
@HeikoS	I could implement the diffusion kernel
@HeikoS	which is very good
@lisitsyn	did you try it on any task?
@HeikoS	better then 1-in-n encoding and then gaussian
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	uci dataset
@HeikoS	mushrooms
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you think there is possible linear approximation ?
@lisitsyn	like random gaussian features or HKM
@HeikoS	yes for sure
@HeikoS	though not that clear
@lisitsyn	is it known already?
@HeikoS	dont know
@lisitsyn	lets formulate if not
@lisitsyn	and win all the kaggles
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'd google for that tomorrow
@lisitsyn	ok I think I am in danger if I keep using my notebook now
@lisitsyn	see you tomorrow :)
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	good luck
