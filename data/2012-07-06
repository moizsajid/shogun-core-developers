 blackburn	sonney2k: I failed to notice fluctuations in confs
 blackburn	aham! found one
@sonney2k	well nr +1=  2979 fluctuates
@sonney2k	that cannot happen...
 nietpiet	I tried to monitor the process with top and it seemed single threaded, but the kernel loading takes most of the time so it is hard to see, i can print some debug output if that helps? (blackburn taught me how :) )
 nietpiet	I can make the C value a bit higher so it takes longer? Easier to monitor with top :)
 blackburn	nietpiet: one thread will be used is you set it
 nietpiet	oh.. and i just print the first 100 confidence scores.. i could print more?
@sonney2k	nietpiet, I would prefer if you store them and compute numpy.max(abs(out1-out2))
 nietpiet	ok
@sonney2k	nietpiet, please upload your script to dpaste
@sonney2k	I simply cannot imagine that it doesn't give exact same results
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r463293d / src/shogun/machine/KernelMachine.cpp : enably apply() w/o arguments to work with custom kernels - http://git.io/0hjzIA
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ I hope that fixes it - nietpiet can you try?
* sonney2k argh
@sonney2k	it is getting too late
@sonney2k	I need sleep
@sonney2k	cu
 nietpiet	@sonney2k, I will upload it, but it is a bit messy now, as you can imagine.. http://pastebin.com/EJ7nrM5z
 nietpiet	numpy.max(abs(out1-out2)) for the consequative runs gives 0.0 ; 1.0 ; 1.0 ; 2.00000023656

 n4nd0	sonney2k: good night
 blackburn	nietpiet: well it must fix exactly the same thing you fixed before

 hsyal	hey n4nd0 , hows your gsoc going ??
 n4nd0	hsyal: hey! it is going fine, what about you?
 n4nd0	still in amazon?
 hsyal	yeah..
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	what are you doing around there?
 hsyal	need your help
 hsyal	some android stuff
 n4nd0	I am not mobile developer to tell the truth .. but tell me
 hsyal	no no.. I need some help on ML only
 n4nd0	ah all right
 hsyal	I wrote "some android stuff " to answer your question
 n4nd0	yeah, got it ;)
 hsyal	Actually I need to some to apply some regression stuff
 hsyal	on some data
 n4nd0	ok
 hsyal	I need some algo which is non-linear,
 blackburn	KRR, SVR
 hsyal	hey blackburn , thanks...
 hsyal	can I extract parameters from those algos
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	parameters like?
 hsyal	by parameters I mean theta's
 hsyal	generated in hypothesis function
 hsyal	Actually I am not in touch with ml, so forgot all jargon.
 blackburn	if you want to learn some model (like quadratic or so) you may use some hand-tailored solution I think
 blackburn	just formulate loss function and pass it to some optimizer
 hsyal	okay...
 hsyal	but it would take time
 blackburn	I am not sure about extracting parameters from alphas, n4nd0 are you?
 hsyal	Actually, I want to embed that hypothesis function inside android program.
 hsyal	So if have any other ideas please do share
 blackburn	http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html#least-square-fitting-leastsq
 n4nd0	blackburn, hsyal I don't really know either
 blackburn	hsyal: it really depends on the model you use
 blackburn	in KRR/SVR with say gaussian kernel you have model that can't be described somehow else
 blackburn	only using alphas and feature vectors you had
 hsyal	blackburn, what about linear regression in shogun, liblinear n ol
 blackburn	hsyal: you said you want non-linear ;)
 hsyal	can they give me hypothesis function..
 blackburn	hsyal: yes, linear
 blackburn	if you have much dimensions it would work
 hsyal	yeah, but I can compromise on that ..
 n4nd0	hsyal, blackburn: now that I think of it, maybe GPs could be useful
 hsyal	GP ?? forgot what it was..
 blackburn	hsyal: gaussian processes
 hsyal	ohhh.
 blackburn	hsyal: just try linear and if you are not satisfied with performance go for nonlinear
 hsyal	and one more thing do you have any piecewise linear regression algo in shogun
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	I don't know any to be honest
 hsyal	Is that any better than non-linear, actually i dont even know what it is
 hsyal	just read it in one paper
 hsyal	and btw hows your work going in gsoc , blackburn
 n4nd0	see you later guys
 blackburn	hsyal: pretty fine

 n4nd0	why?
 vojtech	I though you are connected via server cameron.freenode.net [Vilnius, Lithuania, EU] but it seems to be the IRC server, right?

 vojtech	n4nd0, the first line (i.e. the equality) just expresses the fact that the loss is paid for the labeling with the maximal scoring function
 vojtech	n4nd0, the second (i.e the inequality (4)) is obtained by replacing one of the maximization with only one element of it

 gsomix	sorry for highlightnig
 blackburn	gsomix: I heard sonney2k loves it so feel free to highlight
@sonney2k	blackburn, :P
@sonney2k	gsomix, is the vector3d_get_item set_item stuff really needed?
@sonney2k	I mean shouldn't swig do this?
@sonney2k	ahh no you didn't overload operators so no
@sonney2k	so you would have to do a.set* a.get*
 gsomix	sonney2k, internal_data is protected
 gsomix	not "swigged"
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep, I can overload get/set slots.
 gsomix	but I need some method to work with internal_data from interface file.
@sonney2k	gsomix, but you have get_data_value and set_data_value
 gsomix	yes
@sonney2k	so you can do this without these functions
 gsomix	awww, sorry. don't parse right.
 gsomix	I will try to overload operators.
 gsomix	get_item/set_item are not really needed
-!- sks [~sks@14.97.18.251] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, it is not essential though
 gsomix	yes. I just have try overload sequence protocol functions. e.g. for slices
 gsomix	*tried
 gsomix	I also think that overload of old buffer protocol functions is needed.
 gsomix	e.g. for numpy.frombuffer(my_super_class)
@sonney2k	gsomix, you mean for python2.X ?
 gsomix	2.6<
@sonney2k	gsomix, wait no
@sonney2k	we require python 2.6 anyways
 gsomix	and for numpy.frombuffer(my_super_class)
 gsomix	it uses old buffer protocol
 gsomix	I don't know why.
@sonney2k	gsomix, wait
@sonney2k	there are 2 versions
@sonney2k	the oldest one is the numpy array protocol
@sonney2k	then there was the PEP with the buffer protocol for python 2.X
@sonney2k	and then the newer python3 stuff
@sonney2k	I think we should only support python2.x (x >=6) and python3
 gsomix	ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw which slot do you have to override to get slicing to work?
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw when that stuff works reliably it will also fix the director dot feature issues - if you do buffer protocol support for the SG* datatypes
@sonney2k	gsomix, anyways again *excellent* work
@sonney2k	next steps would then be to implement that stuff for CDenseFeatures  (aka RealFeatures, ByteFeatures etc in python)
@sonney2k	then add some examples and then later do the same for the SG* data types and CustomKernel and CustomDistance (both based on SGMatrix)
 gsomix	 >> to get slicing to work?| I didn't. Just enabled sequence protocol with getter/setter (vector3d_get_item). wait... hmm
-!- sks [~sks@14.97.18.251] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
 gsomix	sonney2k, again, bad docs. I just need to overload sq_slice slot.
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
 gsomix	blackburn loves slices
@sonney2k	gsomix, I do too
 gsomix	ok
 blackburn	everybody do
@sonney2k	and it is soo easy to support them I think
 gsomix	yes!
 gsomix	cool stuff
@sonney2k	gsomix, my suggestion is that you do this for densefeatures as next step then and then we find another challenge for you
 gsomix	ok
@sonney2k	like these typemaps for model selection
 blackburn	to integrate shogun as kernel module
@sonney2k	blackburn, wait the kernel as a shogun module ;-)
@sonney2k	no but seriously, directors, buffer protocol support and these modelselection typemaps will increase useability by 1000% in python_modular
@sonney2k	blackburn, I cannot currently think of other useability enhancements except for better docs and fixing the test suite
@sonney2k	and better error messages
 blackburn	deb
@sonney2k	daily .deb you mean
@sonney2k	well yeah...
@sonney2k	but that is relatively easy given that we have some packaging running already
 blackburn	no idea whether we really need it
@sonney2k	blackburn, it certainly is very convenient to have though for newcomers
 blackburn	actually our users are not like vlc or so users
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but they are also more on the theory side and struggle with install issues
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw with all your reading swig docs - do you know whether it nowadays natively supports doxygen?
@sonney2k	we have some hacks for that but just creating these docs in a python script takes 1 minute...
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I have one problem I could never solve: avoiding to copy memory between shogun feature objects and numpy matrices
 blackburn	no way
 gsomix	sonney2k, unfortunately I don't know.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, hehe I think this could be possible
 blackburn	how to let memory stay when np matrix is deleted&
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	of course one has to specify the fortran flag to numpy matrices
@sonney2k	otherwise it is not the same memory block
@sonney2k	and no gaps etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, well Py_INCREF(matrix)
 gsomix	blackburn, refcount for memory blocks?
@sonney2k	and Py_DECREF in destructor
@sonney2k	blackburn, non trivial business I guess but our hero of the day needs some serious challenges
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am just unsure we really need it
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you have a 5G numpy matrix in memory that you want shogun to work with you wouldn't say this :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, is memory copying in numpy.array(some_with_buffer)?
 blackburn	sonney2k: memory is cheap today :D
@sonney2k	gsomix, I think so yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, bad excuse - how much memory do you have in your notebook?
 blackburn	sonney2k: 8GB
@sonney2k	so then a 7GB matrix it is :D
@sonney2k	and don't tell me memory is cheap now!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will use C++ then :D

 gsomix	>> I think so yes | hmmm.
 gsomix	sonney2k, I don't think so.
 gsomix	but I need to look into numpy code.
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha
@sonney2k	blackburn, ask cwidmer whether he would like that feature - *I* already know the answer :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: which feat? non-copy?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	I don't mind it while I don't have to do that :D
@sonney2k	I think that should be some global flag or some boolean
@sonney2k	(some boolean in each object)
* sonney2k continues work on the buildbot
 blackburn	sonney2k: why sometimes SG_ERROR is not being showed?
@sonney2k	blackburn, that cannot be
@sonney2k	blackburn, must be some corruption before
 gsomix	sonney2k, there is copy flag in numpy.array constructor.
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but that happens sometimes - I do not understand why
 gsomix	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/Ax0ZhNtC
@sonney2k	gsomix, so we could use the same...
 gsomix	yes
 gsomix	it just uses buffer protocol.
@sonney2k	gsomix, when copy=True?
@sonney2k	or always?
 gsomix	sonney2k, always.
 gsomix	but with copy=True memory is not copying
 gsomix	awww typo
 gsomix	*copy=False
@sonney2k	gsomix, but how do they lock memory?
@sonney2k	I mean they need to be sure it is not destroyed...
 gsomix	maybe Py_INCREF(exporter) in getbuffer function?
 gsomix	I really don't know
 gsomix	I need time to learn how this works
@sonney2k	gsomix, problem with swig and objects is certainly that we don't currently know how to DECREF
@sonney2k	just because we never store the original PyObject ptr
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes you are right incref the exporter should do it
@sonney2k	gsomix, but you need to decref it somehow - I hope that is done on decref'ing view?
 gsomix	sonney2k, PyBuffer_Release can decref exporter.
 gsomix	about bf_releasebuffer:
 gsomix	This function MUST NOT decrement view->obj, since that is done automatically in PyBuffer_Release() (this scheme is useful for breaking reference cycles).
 gsomix	PyBuffer_Release() is the interface for the consumer that wraps this function.

@sonney2k	gsomix, cool
@sonney2k	gsomix, we need to somehow ensure that we don't allow any kind of data modifications if we have copy=false
@sonney2k	so preprocessors changing shape or even freeing memory -> blackburn HAHA
@sonney2k	are a no go then

@sonney2k	blackburn, any comments about the cygwin buildbot? should we really try to run all the stuff we currently do also on cygwin?
@sonney2k	I am a bit worried that the build bot might be too slow
@sonney2k	(due to cygwin being slow)
 blackburn	sonney2k: no we shouldn't
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, so what then?
@sonney2k	deb1 - deb3 -> cyg1 - cyg3 ?

@sonney2k	no nightly stuff?
 blackburn	I'd like to put 'if you are using windows' and a link to this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1BmY_HrAlw into disclaimer
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you get TU bot to wrk?
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is running since yesterday
@sonney2k	I now just compiled buildslave on the cygwin bot
 wiking	uristenmegbasztaaaaztaabudoszKURVA VILAGOT azt bassza meg
 blackburn	hungarian obscene lessons
 blackburn	kurva sounds bad for sure
 wiking	gsomix: clabels::get_num_labels isn't const?

 wiking	i mean it is not at the moment but i was just wondering if there's a reason for it that i'm too blind to realise why
 wiking	like the other memcpy story
 wiking	...
 blackburn	wiking: no reason - there is a guy that doesn't like const
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	just that i've got into a catch 22 situation
 blackburn	hah but actually
 blackburn	catch 22?
 gsomix	wiking, I dunno, lol
 wiking	blackburn: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22
@sonney2k	blackburn, did const ever rescue you?
 blackburn	wiking: hah! I have been reading this book in russian before
 blackburn	didn't recognize though :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: my feets did a few times but const didn't for sure

@sonney2k	constantinople
 wiking	gsomix: i mean i really like the other changes, thnx a lot for that
@sonney2k	constantinope
 blackburn	wiking: which changes?
@sonney2k	ahhh
* gsomix left to watch Futurama...
@sonney2k	swig on cygwin is 2.0.0 in the *experimental* distribution
@sonney2k	gsomix, I watched them all
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you mind I add YES and NO as true and false synonyms somewhere?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	my biggest favorite is "Roswell that ends well"
 wiking	blackburn: the const changes in some of the apis
 blackburn	wiking: why do you care SO much?
@sonney2k	gsomix, and I love the http://r33b.net/
 wiking	blackburn: because trying to merge... and i've got a segfault atm
 blackburn	??
 wiking	unrelated actually :0
 blackburn	because of const?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	no that linking problem
 gsomix	sonney2k, \(^_^)/ I have not watched only 6 season.
 blackburn	ALL GLORY TO THE VALGRIND
 wiking	*was
 wiking	but now it's an actually segfault
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah you were too young :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, lets do one thing with the cygwin buildbot
@sonney2k	build libshogun!
 blackburn	sonney2k: makes sense
@sonney2k	all the rest currently has problems
 blackburn	sonney2k: but I really think we should put F OFF for windows users :D
@sonney2k	when swig 2.0.4 or greater is available we do python_modular
 blackburn	before I thought it is cool to support windows
 blackburn	now I do not
* sonney2k tries to compile shogun on cygwin
 wiking	doh
@sonney2k	blackburn, failed on make depend
@sonney2k	OM*G

 wiking	in DynamicObjectArray the get_num_elements returns 0 for me if there are no elements in it... although i've called the ctor with a given array size... is this intentional?
