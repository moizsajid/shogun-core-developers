 sanuj	Saurabh7: hey
 sanuj	what's the timezone for the doodle meeting thing
 Saurabh7	sanuj: yo
 Saurabh7	utc i think
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	wiking: ping me when you are available :)
@wiking	bping
@wiking	ah doodle
@wiking	yes
@wiking	lemme see didn't fill out
 sanuj	wiking: i grepped "()=0" or "() = 0"
 sanuj	found some files
 sanuj	one is MulticlassMachine.h
 sanuj	the class hierarchy goes like CMulticlassMachine --> CBaseMulticlassMachine --> CMachine --> CSGObject
 sanuj	then shall i add all these classes to the base-shogun list?
 sanuj	wiking: ^^\
 sanuj	Saurabh7: did you look at these warnings?
 sanuj	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2853/steps/libshogun/logs/warnings%20(10)/text
 Saurabh7	sanuj: no, whats that ?
 Saurabh7	oh right, dunno seem to be caused by cdflib
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	Saurabh7: can we replicate these warnings on our pc?
 sanuj	i was thinking for fixing them right now
 sanuj	i'm building it....let's see if i get the warnings
 Saurabh7	sanuj: those might be compiler specific
 sanuj	i see
 Saurabh7	anyways first few look straightforward if we can add parentheses
 Saurabh7	in expressions arnd && and others
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	should be easy to fix
 sanuj	i just want to replicate the warnings on my pc first so i no for sure that it's fixed before i send a PR
 sanuj	know*
 Saurabh7	adding parentheses is good anyways :)
 sanuj	aight

 sanuj	today is the day to experiment with multiple irc clients :P
 Saurabh7	irssi is pretty cool i ditched others
 sanuj	too much commands
 sanuj	Saurabh7, does it show logs?
 sanuj	irssi
 Saurabh7	sanuj: you mean logs from  when you were last around ?
 sanuj	yeah
 Saurabh7	I havent set it up why would you need that tho
 sanuj	oh i was just asking
 sanuj	i'm getting these warnings on my local also
 sanuj	fixing them now
 sanuj	lunch break :D

 sanuj	how to generate documentation
 sanuj	what's the make flag for it
 sanuj	i tried make doc
 sanuj	i think it worked

 sanuj	enough warning fixing for one day
 Saurabh7	:D
 Saurabh7	ah didn't realise kernels had subsets too
 Saurabh7	zz
 sanuj	Saurabh7, do you know SWIG?
 Saurabh7	have to do all over again :)
 Saurabh7	sanuj: a bit
 sanuj	hmm
 Saurabh7	what are you trying?
 sanuj	i'm trying to write swig interface for my TAG prototype
 sanuj	let me give you the link
 sanuj	Saurabh7, https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/tree/master/tags-string
 sanuj	i haven't started writing the interface for this
 sanuj	did it for much easier code and generated python bindings
 sanuj	which had no classes or templates
 sanuj	now i need to write it for my tags-string prototype
 sanuj	i tried to decipher some of the swig code in shogun
 sanuj	but it's huge
 sanuj	don't know where to begin
 Saurabh7	sanuj, have a look at some of shogun's templated classes then
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	Saurabh7, which cookbook page are you writing?
 sanuj	i was thinking of writing it on GMMs
 sanuj	need to confirm that with Heiko

 sanuj	HeikoS, hi
 sanuj	can i write a cookbook page on GMMs?

 lisitsyn	sanuj: feel free ;)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay thanks :)
 sanuj	also i wanted to ask
 lisitsyn	yes?
 sanuj	how to decipher shogun's swig code
 lisitsyn	haha decipher
 sanuj	reading swig docs gets boring...examples will help
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	sanuj: did you  manage to create some simple example yet?
 sanuj	yes i have done that for python
 sanuj	only functions
 lisitsyn	ok
 sanuj	no classes or templates
 lisitsyn	what about classes?
 sanuj	i need to do that
 sanuj	was reading this for that
 sanuj	http://www.swig.org/Doc3.0/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_nn38
 sanuj	i was hoping to find similar implementation in shogun code
 sanuj	to get a better idea
 lisitsyn	sanuj: well we don't do anything but just rename our classes
 lisitsyn	to remove C from CClass
 lisitsyn	CSVM -> SVM
 sanuj	yeah
 lisitsyn	this is why we have %rename
 lisitsyn	but we don't have anything else on classes I think
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 sanuj	what are all those .i files in src/interfaces/python_modular
 lisitsyn	sanuj: just the same thing as you write for your example
 lisitsyn	but splitted by modules
 lisitsyn	they are all included so it's just to split things
 sanuj	for my simple swig example
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	i just had to include headers
 sanuj	and declare all the functions
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	we have other things but they are unrelated for now
 lisitsyn	just add some class and you should get a wrapper
 lisitsyn	templates are easy as well
 sanuj	i know that templates are instantiated with all types in swig
 lisitsyn	you just have to specialize them with a declaration
 lisitsyn	I think it is better to be explicit
 lisitsyn	say you have template<typename T> func(T);
 lisitsyn	you just put there two lines
 lisitsyn	template<> func(int);
 lisitsyn	template<> func(double);
 sanuj	yes
 lisitsyn	this means you just 'export' two of them
 sanuj	you were anticipating a problem with swig for string based parameters right?
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	you can't infer the type by string
 lisitsyn	so you would have to return something generic
 lisitsyn	I mean get(string) can't return correct type
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	it can return just some generic holder like any
 lisitsyn	then you have to cast it
 sanuj	so lets go step by step
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	1) generate a wrapper for a class
 lisitsyn	2) make it a template
 lisitsyn	3) declare a few specialization of this template
 sanuj	okay, first i'll get this done with my already existing string-tags prototype
 sanuj	then i'll look further into things
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	sanuj: to work with string
 lisitsyn	create a class
 lisitsyn	basically you can use any
 lisitsyn	'any'
 lisitsyn	but add a few *special* impls of cast
 lisitsyn	asInt = as<int>
 lisitsyn	asDouble = as<double>
 lisitsyn	see what I mean?
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: do you see why we have to specialize these casts?
 sanuj	no
 sanuj	i don't remember your any implementation
 lisitsyn	sanuj: then ask ;)
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	which one did you use?
 lisitsyn	in this repo I see this thing from aer
 sanuj	i think i got it from aer
 lisitsyn	template <typename T>
 lisitsyn	T& as() const
 lisitsyn	but as I said before you have to specialize for swig
 lisitsyn	this would be ambiguous for swig
 lisitsyn	so you have to specialize them with other name
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	i see now
 sanuj	like templates you need to specialize for swig
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	but as<int> and as<float> would be just the same for swig
 lisitsyn	so you have to add asInt, asFloat, etc
 sanuj	we need special implementations
 lisitsyn	then it would look like
 lisitsyn	get("my parameter").asInt()
 lisitsyn	this would return int or fail
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	get("my parameter") would not work with swig
 sanuj	so we need asInt() as well
 lisitsyn	 no it would work but
 lisitsyn	you can't do anything with that generic value
 lisitsyn	maybe you can print it
 lisitsyn	but you have to cast it if you need its typed value
 sanuj	okay :)
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ok so the plan is to make things like (10 + object.get("x").asInt()) work
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	i'll make it work in python
 sanuj	python is fine right?
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	sanuj: and lets speed up a bit, please let me know if you're stuck
 sanuj	lisitsyn, yes, that's what i'm trying to do
 sanuj	i got back home yesterday
 lisitsyn	cool
 sanuj	now will be able to give more time to shogun
 sanuj	i had exams and submissions before that
 lisitsyn	I see
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do you also code in c++ for yandex?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah sometimes
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: mostly in python though
 lisitsyn	because it is faster to write :)
 sanuj	oh yes
 sanuj	going for dinner
 sanuj	will be back soon
