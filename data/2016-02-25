@HeikoS	drwiking: jojo
@HeikoS	yes !
@HeikoS	nice one
@HeikoS	drwiking: I thought we could also add a file for the preample and load things from there .... cleaner
@HeikoS	drwiking: but thanks a lot
@HeikoS	saw that the generated examples are now part of "make test" on travis?
@HeikoS	just need to add all languages now
@HeikoS	and then slowly replace all the old examples by generated ones
@HeikoS	going to increase coverage a lot in the exotic interfaces, as well as simplifies things since we only have to maintain one set of examples
@HeikoS	AND it is used for API doc in the cookbook
@HeikoS	so general win

@HeikoS	drwiking: what about the upload thing
@HeikoS	drwiking: uploading cookbook html o a webserver
@drwiking	ok
@drwiking	from travis/
@drwiking	?

@HeikoS	drwiking: yes first step, to be able to review patches for cookbook
@drwiking	ok
@drwiking	so we need
@HeikoS	drwiking: second step: make the buildbot upload the cookbook latest version in the nightly build
@drwiking	i guess different output
@HeikoS	the third travis build generates the html
@drwiking	but wait
@HeikoS	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/111699488
@HeikoS	drwiking: yes, is hat to contain the revision in the travis uploads
@HeikoS	the buildbot nightly goes to a fixed url just as the doxygen docs
@drwiking	ok
@drwiking	i need to understand
@drwiking	what's with travis
@drwiking	:(
@drwiking	i mean where we should presist the html
@drwiking	to be reviewed
@drwiking	i guess we should
@drwiking	have a temp space on one of the machines
@HeikoS	drwiking:
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	some folder that has a public html link for some time
@HeikoS	until the patch is merged basically
@HeikoS	or max a month or so
@HeikoS	drwiking: lisitsyn suggested to use cron to clean them up
@HeikoS	drwiking: btw also got some good news from NIPS: we asked ralf herbrich (head of amazon berlin) to get some aws hours, and he agreed to quite a significant amount. I will try to get this going soon. We could use this for the cloud thing maybe
