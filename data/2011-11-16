 blackburn	sonne|work: sonney2k before fixing tests I need to get rid of issue reported by madeleine
 blackburn	so do not expect tests will be ready before this weekend
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	which issues does she have?
 sonne|work	she should better post on the mailinglist...
 blackburn	memory leak was solved
 blackburn	no it is a crash
 blackburn	well I care too much I guess
 blackburn	so she wrote directly to me
 blackburn	anyway as you said you have no time so I'm the only one able to try to solve this issue
 sonne|work	I take bugfixes seriously - so she should post to the ML
 blackburn	I can forward our thread to you if you want
 blackburn	next time I'd suggest she to write to mailing list too
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	note that I used to reply to private shogun emails a lot - but now there are just too many
 sonne|work	so it is only possible to do this via the mailinglist
 sonne|work	this way it is documented in the ML archive
 blackburn	forwarded a problem
 sonne|work	and available for the future
 blackburn	mostly crap
 blackburn	I don't think it is possible to find something there
 blackburn	or I have no skillz for this crazy task
 blackburn	I don't know
 sonne|work	blackburn her bug is easy to solve - she forgot to call init_shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: we do not need to call init_shogun with java_modular
 sonne|work	yes we need to
 blackburn	and exactly the same .java works on notebook
 sonne|work	all examples have it
 sonne|work	modshogun.init_shogun_with_defaults()
 sonne|work	modshogun.exit_shogun();
 blackburn	&!
 blackburn	okay I'll write to her
 blackburn	sonne|work: how can it work without?
 sonne|work	I think she was just lucky that nothing got outputted to the screen
 sonne|work	ok back to work
 blackburn	sonne|work: no
 blackburn	it is in script
 blackburn	so the problem is not easy to solve
 sonne|work	no I mean shogun does not use SG_PRINT
 blackburn	it fails on some MKL activity
 sonne|work	yeah I guess it outputs sth
 sonne|work	anyway let her try with init_* and report back
 blackburn	sonne|work: init and exit is here, she did not forgot it
 blackburn	!
 sonne|work	I don't have taht script
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have and it is in
 blackburn	it is a bug related to some versions/archs or so
 blackburn	cause the same scripts works fine on notebook
 sonne|work	I need the script to be of any help
 sonne|work	but now I have to work!
 blackburn	ok
