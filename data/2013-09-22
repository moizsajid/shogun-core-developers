 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok
@sonney2k	HeikoS, why this? I mean tests are still run on the buildbot which tests tons of other stuff too
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I think travis is only useful to get a rough idea if this patch is OKish
@HeikoS	sonney2k: its just that people tend to focus more on travis, so it would be good to have them there to immediately get a quick check
@sonney2k	I actaully don't look at travis
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah exactly, so have them in to see whether one forgot for example to update
@HeikoS	sonney2k: others do
@HeikoS	so whats the downside of having them in?
@HeikoS	because its essentially free
@HeikoS	so why not?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, runtime and such numerical precision issues
@HeikoS	sonney2k: numerical precision will be solved soon
@HeikoS	sonney2k: runtime should be fine for now
@sonney2k	well I don't care much to me what the buildbot says is what is important because we test a lot more
@sonney2k	but I see the benefit in a quick pretest and that is what travis is for me
@HeikoS	sonney2k: integration doesnt take too long. You might not care, I do care about having them on travis. Since they break all the time, I want to know as early an convenient as possible. So I vote for putting them in. Not a big thing though
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I like the constructor :) gotta go now, see you tomorrow. Please let me know where you are at the end of your day via email.
@HeikoS	sonney2k: bye
 votjakovr	HeikoS: see you :)

 wiking	oh buildbot buildbot...
 wiking	what have u done...:>

@sonney2k	wiking, ?
 wiking	nada
@sonney2k	wiking, lisitsyn tried to get the gdb stuff in
@sonney2k	wiking, he submitted for integration tests but not unit
@sonney2k	wiking, do you know where the unit test command is run?
 lisitsyn	yeah the usage is pretty simple
 lisitsyn	but I don't know where to put it
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean filters need to be set?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1866/steps/test%20python%20modular/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	seen this?
@sonney2k	1200s timeout...
@sonney2k	why is heiko saying modular is broken?
 lisitsyn	uh
@sonney2k	the buildbot could compile them?!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it worked here
@sonney2k	here too
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, tell him :)

@sonney2k	HeikoS, try git clean -dfx
@sonney2k	HeikoS, modular interfaces compile for us
@HeikoS	weird
@sonney2k	HeikoS, maybe some cmake dependency is not working or you didn't re-run cmake
@HeikoS	I did a new build dir
@HeikoS	though no git clean
@HeikoS	sonney2k: btw greetings from portugal :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, maybe in tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, line 85
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes but that runs all tests
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we don't run all tests in one go remember?
 lisitsyn	yes thats why I don't understand
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I think that would do it since only the filter determines what to run
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so just give it a try and create some invalid memory access or so for gdb to test

@sonney2k	HeikoS has to take over

 foulwall	hi sonney2k
@sonney2k	foulwall, hi!
@sonney2k	foulwall, how is it going?
 foulwall	How can I do with clustering hierachy demo? is there any existing demos?
@sonney2k	Any news already on the arts/asp stuff?
 foulwall	I sent a pr this morning.
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	nice
@sonney2k	foulwall, yes there is an example but only in octave_modular
 foulwall	and Do I have to create a two figure layout for displaying donor and acceptor in asp demo??
 shogun-buildbot	build #177 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/177
 foulwall	Currently I make a dropdown list for donor and acceptor choosing
 foulwall	sonney2k: and one more question. Can I add shogun repo as a submodule in shogundemo? so that I can load the applications as package?
 foulwall	I'll have a look at that matlab demo and finish hierachy demo today
@sonney2k	foulwall, for the tree I need to have a look. will do this evening
@sonney2k	foulwall, for donor/acceptor it would be nice if it was one figure with two curves in it (say red acceptor / blue donor or so)
 foulwall	ok sonney2k .
 foulwall	I'll modify it and send a new pr. in class now, will do it ASAP
@sonney2k	foulwall, about submodule - maybe it would be better to have an environment variable specifying where the application dir is
@sonney2k	foulwall, yes sure
 foulwall	ok I'll have a try
@sonney2k	foulwall, maybe it would be best to have a settings.py or so that you import that sets e.g. adds some paths to the PYTHONPATH environment variable / does other setting adjustments

@iglesiasg	sup guys
 besser82	sonne|osx, wiking, iglesiasg: Has anybody ever asked SVMlight maintainer about making it avail. under GPLv3+ or related lic?
@iglesiasg	besser82, not AFAIK
@iglesiasg	no idea what's the opinion of Joachims about that
 besser82	sonne|osx, wiking, iglesiasg: So I'll do :)
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	besser82: sonney2k BEGGED to gplize it
 lisitsyn	no way
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, any special reason?
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: would be interesting to know....
 lisitsyn	well he is not having fun of open source
 lisitsyn	no idea
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: Let me talk to him, possibly there might be any chance ;)
 lisitsyn	well feel free :)
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: most people doing such non-commecial licesense are afraid of having the code bundled into some comm. app from whereever ;)
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	I'd actually be happy if my code is bundled to some commercial app
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	why not :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: they are not informed about GPLv3+ demands to have the code using it to be GPL'ed as well
@iglesiasg	yes, me too
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, but we are not famous :D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: AGPLv3+ would even go that far to demeand public release all changes made to orig. code  ;)
 lisitsyn	yeah I know
 besser82	lisitsyn, iglesiasg: that possibly might be some reason to change Joachims mind ;)
@iglesiasg	one question though
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, SVMLight is open source, right?
 lisitsyn	no
 besser82	iglesiasg: no way
 lisitsyn	you may download the sources but it is not open source
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	iglesiasg: you are allowed to use for personal / research stuff, but no redist && no commercial
@iglesiasg	I am pretty bad at licensing terms
@iglesiasg	so that the code is open (as that you can go ahead and read the source), doesn't mean it is open source?
@iglesiasg	besser82, lisitsyn ^
 besser82	iglesiasg:yes
 besser82	iglesiasg: having the code published doesn't mean it to be open source
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no, open source is sth that is published under proper open source license
 lisitsyn	MIT BSD GPL whatever
@iglesiasg	besser82, aham. Total misconception from my part then
 besser82	iglesiasg: np
@iglesiasg	but one catch I see
 besser82	iglesiasg: which?
@iglesiasg	if the code is readable but not open sourced
 besser82	iglesiasg: yes...
@iglesiasg	what is it that prevents anyone from just going ahead and copy paste it?
 lisitsyn	the author didn't give you rights
 besser82	iglesiasg: basically nothing, but law if author get aware ;)
 lisitsyn	in any license it is stated
 lisitsyn	you are free to blablabla
@iglesiasg	aham
 lisitsyn	if there is no such thing
 lisitsyn	you are not allowed to do that
@iglesiasg	what if one tries to hide that is it actually a copy?
@iglesiasg	changing variable names, etc
@iglesiasg	I wonder where the limit is
 besser82	iglesiasg: binary diff?
 lisitsyn	hehe
 lisitsyn	good question
 lisitsyn	it is called derivative work
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: not even close !
 lisitsyn	why?
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: derivative work needs substatial changes
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: not even changing var / func names ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: won't it be considered derivative?
 lisitsyn	anyway if you just rename variables
 lisitsyn	you are still under the law
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: derivative would be if you would change substatial portions of it, but keeping some subfunctions or such ;)
@iglesiasg	I see
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: law && copyright && license of upstream author still apply ;)
@iglesiasg	I guess the frontiers there are somewhat blurry
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: possibly
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: basically if you have any portions of original code left
 lisitsyn	it still 'works'
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: a sure derivative work would be implementing SVMlight with own code written from scratch ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, what?! Even if you do that the upstream author license applies!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: ehm how can license apply here
 besser82	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: yes, the algorithmn itself is still under upstream lic ;)
 besser82	...brb...   ---> luch ;)
 besser82	...brb...   ---> lunch ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82,  enjoy!

 lambday	sonne|osx: SGVector doesn't support int64_t as index, right?
