 blackburn	sonney2k: I have found worse doc than shogun have: netcracker :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh - I guess the project is bigger so it is more difficult to have doc coverage
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw how is your 1 patch per day going :D
 CIA-3	shogun: Evan Shelhamer master * r486a452 / (doc/pages/Installation.mainpage src/INSTALL): Updated install docs w/ current interfaces names, homebrew suggestion for OSX - http://git.io/YSZEtA
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8adcc9d / (doc/pages/Installation.mainpage src/INSTALL):
 CIA-3	shogun: Merge pull request #322 from shelhamer/install_docs
 CIA-3	shogun: Updated install docs w/ current interfaces names, homebrew suggestion - http://git.io/xwyiHQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: in progress
 blackburn	shiiit I've got vertical stripe on my lcd screen
@sonney2k	I guess you need to reboot
 blackburn	I need to replace my screen..
 blackburn	sonney2k: superlu success
 blackburn	33s for 6K
 blackburn	sklearn took 90s
@sonney2k	sounds good
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	but I have to investigate why the fuck the results *are* different
 blackburn	got it
 blackburn	sonney2k:
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 58.796179s
 blackburn	SKLEARN Took 236.027341s
@sonney2k	4 times faster - neat
 blackburn	who's your daddy
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	hatehatehate
@sonney2k	hate?
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rf694cb6 / (152 files in 10 dirs):
 CIA-3	shogun: Replace void foo(void) -> void foo() and finish template .h -> .cpp
 CIA-3	shogun: transition in shogun/features/* - http://git.io/5Mg7XQ
@sonney2k	who is to be hated?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've been hating myself for a while
 blackburn	I broke arpack code and it took a 0.5h to fix that
 blackburn	still unstable ^(
 blackburn	:(
@sonney2k	hmm ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: I had a conversation with one professor here, may be I will do some road sign recognition as my bachelor work
 blackburn	he is the only man knowing what SVM is :D
@sonney2k	fun :)
@sonney2k	I wish I was young again to spend some more time :)
@sonney2k	on such things
 blackburn	V. A. Fursov, I. A. Kulagina, and N. E. Kozin. Building of Classifiers Based on Conjugation Indices. Optical Memory and Neural Networks (Information Optics) Vol. 16 No. 3 2007
 blackburn	Vladimir Fursov, IrinaKulagina, Nikita Kozin.. Building of Classifier Based on Conjugation Indexes. Proceedings of The 5-th International Conference on Machine Lerning and Data Mining. Leipzig, Germany, 18 - 20 July, 2007, p. 231-235.
 blackburn	that is two papers describing some idea he have
 blackburn	I'm sure it will be in shogun if idea worths something :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I wish to commit superlu stuff but it is not stable yet, damn!
@sonney2k	then get it stable!
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea what is wrong
 blackburn	there are near-singular matrix being LU-factorized and etc
 blackburn	a lot of numerical issues
 blackburn	sonney2k: got it!
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	+1e-9 save me
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	I would have suggested that :D
 blackburn	Computing embedding of 6000 vectors using LTSA
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 7.369902s
 blackburn	SKLEARN Took 85.428765s
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay who am I? :D
@sonney2k	daaaaady
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	surprise to get such a small time for ltsa
@sonney2k	due to the +1e-9 trick?
 blackburn	not really, it just stabilized
 blackburn	before it was measures for LLE
 blackburn	LTSA is computationally easier
 blackburn	I have no idea why it is so slow in sklearn
 blackburn	sonney2k: some more improvements and it is worth to write a paper I hope
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I got rid of all templated code from .h file in shogun/features
 blackburn	yeah I have seen that
@sonney2k	the code is now much better to digest now
 blackburn	sonney2k:
 blackburn	Computing embedding of 8000 vectors using LTSA
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 12.350444s
 blackburn	SKLEARN Took 189.827115s
@sonney2k	but result is the same?
 blackburn	exactly
@sonney2k	blackburn, let them know
@sonney2k	... if you want competition :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm doing it in attempt to write a paper with chris
 blackburn	so they would see how slow their ltsa is in a paper
 blackburn	drtoolbox (that thing with INFINITY methods) have pretty fast code btw
 blackburn	I will measure it too
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about 'options' structures?
 blackburn	http://pastebin.com/xMm9tpRZ
 blackburn	something like that
@sonney2k	I don't understand - you want to set options for arpack or what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I would love to use struct instead of a lot of args
 blackburn	easier to extend, etc
@sonney2k	it makes sense when you simultaneously have to set many options
 blackburn	sonney2k: already ~10 params
