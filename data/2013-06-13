 hushell	iglesiasg: You said hi to me last week, but I missed :(
@iglesiasg	hushell: yeah! I was going to ask you something about optimization
@iglesiasg	but I ended up convincing myself about it :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I am not very familiar with opt :(
 hushell	iglesiasg: about SSVM?
@iglesiasg	hushell: it was something about the cutting plane algorithm for SSVM
@iglesiasg	yeah
@iglesiasg	but never mind, it is fine now :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: then I know a little bit :)
 hushell	But I am sure Patrick knows much more than me
 patrickp	iglesiasg: for next time, feel free to send me an email, I'll try to answer in a timely manner :)
