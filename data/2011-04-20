 Tanmoy	hi all
-!- sploving [sploving@210.77.26.125] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	sploving, long time no see...
 sploving	sonney2k, yeap
@sonney2k	glad to see you again.
 sploving	preparing for a paper
 sploving	me too
 sploving	our org have 5 slots. do you think that is enough?
@sonney2k	sploving, enough for what?
@sonney2k	we are actually quite happy to having received so many slots - new orgs usually get 1-2
 sploving	so many proposals too 70
@sonney2k	yes true... I have heard of other orgs that had >120 proposals and received only 2 slots though
@sonney2k	so we shouldn't complain
 sploving	I heard that the slots number is fluid until the final announcement
 sploving	but most of time, it will not change, right?
@sonney2k	sploving, it can only increase (though not in our case)
@sonney2k	well we can give away slots too if we think we don't have enough strong candidates
 siddharth	hi all
 sploving	hello siddharth
@sonney2k	in the end it is critically important to us that every candidate we get succeeds. otherwise we won't be accepted into upcoming GSoC's...
 siddharth	sonney2k, I have fixed the errors and included new class CLoss...I have also added the function vector_multiply()...now have to test the patch
 siddharth	so should I pull request or after testing?
@sonney2k	pull request now and do the testing while I try to have a look at it... no promises that I can do it now though
 sploving	sonney2k, if an org has some project fail, then in next year, it will have fewer slots, not accepted. This is my understanding
 siddharth	ok
@sonney2k	sploving, or not at all be accepted - ubuntu / gimp ...
 sploving	oh. so strict.
@sonney2k	(even though I am not sure if this is really true - that is what I heard though)
 siddharth	sonney2k, did pull request
@sonney2k	thx
 siddharth	sonney2k, may I test on my patch after 2 days...as I have an important deadline on 22nd...Though I can fix errors in my patch now
@sonney2k	sure
 siddharth	thanks :)
@bettyboo	funny

@sonney2k	siddharth, looks much better now. What is missing though is to define one abstract CLoss class and then have several classes that derive from there and provie the loss and dloss() functions
-!- dvevre [b49531e3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	provide
 siddharth	sonney2k, sry was not here
 siddharth	What do u mean by 'several' classes... I mean we can have a derived class which will provide the loss and dloss function
@sonney2k	siddharth, you could have a class CLoss (just as interface) and a class CLogisticLoss derived from it
@sonney2k	...that implements the interface
 siddharth	ok will make Closs as abstract class

 dave718	Is it possible to use a masked set of features for training?  E.g. would like to do cross-validation with a RealFileFeatures dataset, but ideally would like to avoid having to generate multiple copies of the dataset.
 dave718	Is there any way to tell the classifier to exclude a certain range of vectors?

 blackburn	ok, will discuss later ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, discuss what?
 blackburn	hehe.
 blackburn	may be you will have some ideas.. about it's design
 blackburn	cause there are some different ways to represent graph, etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, did I miss anything
 blackburn	sonney2k: eh.. you don't. I mean I'm going to implement graph class
 blackburn	for example I don't know to store pointers in graph nodes or to store only some numbers
@sonney2k	graph like in ROC curve or real graph
@sonney2k	real ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is more efficient to only ever store indices
@sonney2k	so have an array of nodes and then have an index into it
 blackburn	but there is a need of enumerate objects, etc
 blackburn	anyway sounds more proper to me too
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you plan to use graphs somewhere?
 blackburn	because I need to decide what capabilities should it provide
@sonney2k	not yet :-) you could predict graphs or compute graph kernels ;)
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	sonney2k: will start working on CGraph after ROC
@sonney2k	FYI: I just heard on #gsoc that all orgs got the number of slots they requested except for new ones (they got only 1-2 with a few exceptions).
@sonney2k	blackburn, you need that for your dim reduction stuff?
 blackburn	sonney2k: graph? yeap
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw, I fixed *all* tests
 blackburn	it is cool
 blackburn	have I done something wrong (of what I don't know yet)?
-!- dvevre [~shashwat@180.149.49.229] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: about your information, why did you say it and how many did you requested?
-!- Mengyun [~dorothyk@S0106001a803d4363.vc.shawcable.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't think so - all good. Heiko added some tests that triggered bugs I had in my code
 blackburn	Heiko? don't see his commits :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think it is good to know
@sonney2k	blackburn, he is on vactions
@sonney2k	vacations that is
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean we already know that we the happy ones with 5 slots ;)
 blackburn	I finally has get rid of my cold but haven't much time for developing just now, will at this weekend..
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it was an official statement by the google guys - the other information was just from some paper
 blackburn	ah, I see
 blackburn	anyway we are lucky
-!- Mengyun [~dorothyk@S0106001a803d4363.vc.shawcable.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	and no conflicts so far.

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you mean duplication conflicts?
-!- dvevre [~shashwat@180.149.49.229] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	yes - none so far
 blackburn	hm. forgot to implement precision
 blackburn	it seems to be important measure
@sonney2k	PRC - just use the formula in the python script
 blackburn	sonney2k: I trust python script with accuracy now :)
@sonney2k	sonney2k, at least sth :)
@bettyboo	sonney2k, funny
-!- Tanmoy [75d35896@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.88.150] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 blackburn	and before PRC I should implement ROC
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but it could be that the roc script in the c++ file is more correct
 blackburn	sonney2k: will look at it
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the most convenient way to return ROC graph?
 blackburn	I mean there is irregularity on both axes and we should return points..
@sonney2k	sonney2k, ehh irregularity? there should be as many points as there are labels...
 blackburn	in perfmeasures it did with 2-d array
@sonney2k	blackburn, makes sense 2d matrix
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean scores are irregular. and we can't return only y-axis
 josip	sonney2k: as many labels + 1 I think
 blackburn	okay, will do it the same as in perfmeasures
 josip	the code now works with a (N+1)x2 matrix iirc
@sonney2k	n+1 - could be
 josip	as you do n thresholds for each label and one for (0,0)
 josip	or rather (1,1) depending on what you threshold
@sonney2k	(0,0) and (1,1) are definitve end points
 josip	yup
@sonney2k	blackburn, the script in shogun should compute the convex hull of the roc curve only a realizable one
 blackburn	realizable?
@sonney2k	the one in the python script has problems when there are multiple outputs that are equal
 blackburn	eh.. okay
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is an under / over estimated roc that one can compute and one that is convex hull - read fawcetts paper if you are interested http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEEQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.98.4088%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&rct=j&q=roc%20analysis&ei=LD-vTb7aN8TJswar-bzhDA&usg=AFQjCNHO-_yjWAJrRVnJms7MbcqaJkd8eg&sig2=irwOHUW4s6HfQSjdEoMDNw&cad=rja
 blackburn	already reading it ;)
 blackburn	thank you
 josip	computing the convex hull is faster than the trapezoid algorithm?
 josip	ignore my previous question

-!- dvevre [~shashwat@180.149.49.229] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn,  in principle one would have to do it for PR curve too - but no idea how that works
@sonney2k	josip, equivalent :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok, will see, now will just make ROC, later auROC
@sonney2k	blackburn, when you have the ROC Curve auROC is easy
 blackburn	it seems so, but don't understand about decision between trapezoid and convex hull..
 blackburn	will understand it after some readings ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw, seems ROC will not be implemented in ContingentTableEvaluation
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course not :)
@bettyboo	:>
@sonney2k	extra class
@sonney2k	like PRC
 blackburn	did it, but have been thinking about its merging - and it makes no sense at all

 blackburn	sonney2k: how can I help you with project in may?
 blackburn	or it was an another joke? :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not sure I understand the question? You don't have enough tasks to solve yet?
 blackburn	sonney2k: so it seems to be an another joke :) you said I could help you after your child is born
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh well discuss with the students that are looking for help of course and solve their problems :)
 blackburn	students? eh?
* sonney2k is looking at the commit count
 blackburn	ah, nevermind, another joke I accepted as serious offer ;)
@sonney2k	you have 72 commits already - by far more than all others
 blackburn	I mean there won't be more than 6-7 students
@sonney2k	5
 blackburn	*may be some will stay
 blackburn	but possibility is about zero, yeah ;)
@bettyboo	rahaha
 blackburn	sonney2k: and how can I help them? there would be mentors for it, etc
@sonney2k	of course I will try to give some feedback - but it is tough in the first 2 weeks. won't have much if at all sleep
@sonney2k	blackburn, usually it helps to just discuss about ideas with someone
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	ideally all the accepted students discuss publicly on the mailinglist about their plans
 blackburn	sonney2k: in that case of course i would be happy to help you
@sonney2k	and write (very short!!!) what they did/plan to do this week
 blackburn	but I haven't much authority for doing this just like you
@sonney2k	and of course IRC for faster round trip times
@sonney2k	I do lots of mistakes...
@sonney2k	all that is needed/wanted is some common sense
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think posting weekly plan to ML is a good idea?
@sonney2k	in the beginning definitely
@sonney2k	when everyone is working as expected we might loosening this criterion
@sonney2k	recall that we need 100% success ....
 blackburn	okay, induced me ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have an idea of develop some latex template for weekly report, how you mind it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ascii to the mailinglist only
 blackburn	as you wish :P
@sonney2k	no one can read more then a few sentences
@sonney2k	s/can/wants to/
 josip	another idea is to keep a public blog
 josip	+ code reviews
 josip	we did something like this last year and it worked nicely, as you get plenty of feedback
 josip	and put all of the blogs on a planet (the aggregation software)
@sonney2k	josip, yeah but a mailinglist at least has the interested people reading what you write
@sonney2k	josip, we are not big enough to have that...
@sonney2k	josip, that would make a lot of sense for e.g. debian or such big orgs
 josip	yes, it's not that it's hard to track 5 blogs, but due to the laziness factor it might be convenient
 josip	and it's super easy to setup
@sonney2k	the machine learning community is already a niche and shogun is even more
 josip	well, if people are used to the ml, then that might be best I suppose
* blackburn likes the idea of blogs
@sonney2k	hmmhh is any of you seriously blogging?
* josip not
* sonney2k not
* blackburn not
@sonney2k	ok then mailinglist
@sonney2k	(easy)
 josip	but gsoc-specific blogs might be doable
 blackburn	:D
 josip	hehe, yeah :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have some fixes for already implemented ContingencyTableEvaluation
 blackburn	sonney2k: shall I make a pull request for it or unite it with ROC?
 lionelc_	I think it would be a good idea to have a blog such as blogger.com or wordpress.com
@sonney2k	blackburn, make a pull request - the smaller the better
 blackburn	ok
@sonney2k	lionelc_, I am not against having a blog if you guys blog about what you do (or someone blogs at all).
@sonney2k	It is just that I am too lazy for that and writing an email with 3-5 sentences is much easier to *me* personally
 josip	well, because weekly reports can get lengthy we did this last year: brief summaries on the mailing list and the long version on the blog
 lionelc_	yep... I mean in a blog students at least can post html instead of plain ascii, possibly with some social buttons. a "like" button may make students more motivated
 lionelc_	sonney2k: so for a quick review of 3-5 sentences from mentors, it can be done via comments
@sonney2k	alright then lets have both and some kind of planet shogun thing
@sonney2k	josip, any idea how to set that up
@sonney2k	I wouldn't even mind to include students willing to contribute but not accepted into GSoC
 josip	http://www.planetplanet.org/ if I'm not mistaken
@sonney2k	but I don't have a blog and I am to lazy anyways to write text for humans :)

@sonney2k	so I ran everything through google translate - and indeed it matches the topic :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, have a nice sleep
 blackburn	sonney2k: good night
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.2.228] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 lionelc_	blackburn: have a nice sleep. see you here tomorrow
@sonney2k	josip, that url is hilarious :)
@sonney2k	link that is
 lionelc_	sonney2k: you mean you ran everything via google English-Chinese translate?
@sonney2k	lionelc_, how would you check that it is not curses and complaints?
 lionelc_	sonney2k: ummm... never did so. but I think I can set a range of key words, and do pattern matching
@sonney2k	lionelc_, what does http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc_cn/index.html tell you?
@sonney2k	I cannot even read anything
@sonney2k	except short double etc
@sonney2k	which reminds me that this page is outdated
@sonney2k	*crap*
 lionelc_	sonney2k: obviously there are no courses/complaints there
@sonney2k	heh :D
 lionelc_	just a description of what Shogun can do. and yes, it is outdated
 lionelc_	sonney2k: the "installation" part is too short, which can distract many potential Chinese users if they fail in installation
@sonney2k	I welcome any doc related contribution!
 josip	sonney2k: do you happen to know any good ML people at ETHZ?
 josip	I know Andreas Krause is there and they have the ML Group with Prof. Buhmann . Anyone else?
@sonney2k	I know Cheng Soon Ong there - he is also with JB
 josip	and Peter Buhlmann from the Stats group
 josip	hm, thanks. It seems like a nice place
 lionelc_	sonney2k: also, if some tutorials on SVM itself can be added there, at least some links, then they can be helpful
 josip	I hope I'll like it
@sonney2k	lionelc_, patches welcome
@sonney2k	lionelc_, I guess one could write a book about all the things in shogun...
 lionelc_	sonney2k: lol. what I proposed should be done by the webmaster, who can edit the webpages
 lionelc_	sonney2k: I think you have someone who specially manages the website?
@sonney2k	lionelc_, no I don't want to do this
@sonney2k	and btw. the website is generated from doxygen docs
@sonney2k	in doc/pages dir
 lionelc_	sonney2k: I see
@sonney2k	lionelc_, so patches welcome :D
