 sonne|work	beschraenkter

 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	two mistakes in place lol
 blackburn	I hardly can pronounce that
 sonne|work	blackburn: for some reason I want to get back to hardware business... just ordered a raspberry pi
 sonne|work	and will likely order lots of leds/transistors/resistors/chips and other basic equipment and an arduino board
 sonne|work	that should be fun to control the lights of the fish tanks with the raspberry pi :)
 sonne|work	maybe a bit overkill to have wireless lan and all that but hey what could be more fun?
 blackburn	oh I want raspberry too actually
 blackburn	no idea how can I apply it and what for though
 sonne|work	well it runs linux and has some >8 GPIO pins
 sonne|work	so you can do anything
 sonne|work	but I guess arduino board is easier
 blackburn	yeah but anything is still way too broad for me
 blackburn	actually I am a litlle from computer vision so may be attaching a camera..
 sonne|work	blackburn: it is better that you work on shogun while I am distracted w/ hardware business
 blackburn	last week or even more were so crazy
 sonne|work	blackburn: but attaching a camera is what you can do on your normal notebook
 blackburn	well I can't put my notebook to DER ZIMMERDECKE
 blackburn	I love german words lol
 sonne|work	an die zimmerdecke :)
 blackburn	ah I am lame anyway
 blackburn	one can not simply recall der/die/das thing in german :)
 sonne|work	der, die, das - das macht spass :D

 blackburn1	sonney2k: converting strings is a kind of pain
 blackburn1	to referenced data
 blackburn1	:)
 naywhayare	CKMeans::clustknb(bool use_old_mus, float64_t* mus_start) seems to imply that by setting use_old_mus to true and passing a set of centroids with mus_start, I can get k-means to cluster using those centroids as starting points
 naywhayare	but this is not documented; can someone confirm whether or not this is true?
 naywhayare	I'd prefer not to waste an hour or two digging down a rabbit hole I don't need to
 naywhayare	so thanks in advance for any help
