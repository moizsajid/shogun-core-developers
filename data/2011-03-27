 sonney2k	skydiver, thx
 skydiver	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/developer__tutorial.html - also should be fixed with http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/developer_tutorial.html
 sonney2k	skydiver, I am just running a link checker
 skydiver	i have question about gsoc idea: "Implement Kernel Feature Analysis (KFA)"
 skydiver	unfortunately i don't have access to mentioned article http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/CVPR.2006.43

@sonney2k	Did anyone try to login the new google melange gsoc site?
 AdaHopper	Sorry sonney, I just gone out
 AdaHopper	I would like to implement one of the new machine learning algorithms
 AdaHopper	I don't know if you received some applications before, or if you have some preference between them
 AdaHopper	so I could get ready a better application
 siddharth	hello
 siddharth	How to apply for shogun through Google Summer of Code?
 AdaHopper	by the way, I just logged at the new google melange site.
@sonney2k	siddharth, that is a good question... I am not sure if this is possible already - probably tomorrow there should be some apply link according to #gsoc
@sonney2k	AdaHopper, you should email chris about this, he is mentoring this.
@sonney2k	(or will be)
@sonney2k	yoh, around to talk about git?

 yoh	sonney2k: uff, git again ;)
 yoh	sonney2k: I am somewhat around (conditioned on family dragging me away from the laptop)
@sonney2k	yoh, no idea who suggest to switch to git ;-)
@sonney2k	yoh, family is luckily asleep here
 yoh	sonney2k: it was the inner voice I bet
@sonney2k	luckily  they admittedly seem to sleep a lot
@sonney2k	yoh, well I'd like to finish the git transition
@sonney2k	not sure if you have received my reply (email?)
 yoh	yeah -- those precious hours after everybody (but yourself) closes their eyes to enjoy lovely dreams ;)
 yoh	received... just opened
@sonney2k	... and all powered by black tea and tons of chocolate...
@sonney2k	yoh, in short I'd like to get shogun (Source) repo to minimal size
@sonney2k	so I don't mind trashing github again but I am not sure how to do it and what will happen with the shogun-toolbox.org git mirror (that has some remote branches)
@sonney2k	regarding data I would just keep it in git and ftp.
 yoh	ok -- read email
@sonney2k	but git annex really sounds cool
 yoh	so, if you rewrite git repository while pruning some files it better be done on the repository with all the branches of interest available locally I think... e.g. pretty much in the state of right after svn2git... then rewrite, gc, repack, reinit repositories on github and shogun-toolbox.org, and push fresh nice tidy local one to both of those remotes
-!- mode/#shogun [-o sonney2k] by ChanServ
 yoh	sounds reasonable?
 sonney2k	in principle yes
 sonney2k	the only problem I see is that svn2git creates a remote repository
 yoh	meanwhile just experiment with rewrite -- see how much space would you save? you might recall some other data files which were committed/removed
 yoh	never used svn2git -- remote one is for incremental syncs from SVN?
 sonney2k	so it is that structure that I find on the server - and I definitely have to git clone this
 yoh	are you planing on fetching new commits from SVN using svn2git ?  then you would need to research how to make it work on rewritten one... with 'git svn' it would have been quite easy
 sonney2k	no svn is *DEAD*
 yoh	ah, cool
 yoh	not sure what you meant with "so it is that structure that I find on the server - and I definitely have to git clone this"
 sonney2k	yoh, svn2git operates on the subversion tarball (the true archive) and comes up with a .git thingy that you can directly put on the sever
 sonney2k	server
 sonney2k	in case of shogun this contains
 sonney2k	branches
 sonney2k	config
 sonney2k	description
 sonney2k	HEAD
 sonney2k	hooks
 sonney2k	info
 sonney2k	marks-shogun.git
 sonney2k	objects
 sonney2k	refs
 yoh	not sure what is marks-shogun.git
 yoh	probably some symbolic-ref (like HEAD)
 sonney2k	yoh, some file with a number and a hash
 yoh	but otherwise it is just a generic git repository structure
 sonney2k	maybe
 sonney2k	yes it is
 sonney2k	svn2git gets all the tags right (even when modifications exist it seems)
 sonney2k	and branches are remote branches
 sonney2k	  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
 sonney2k	  origin/boost_serialization
 sonney2k	  origin/galaxy
 sonney2k	  origin/master
 sonney2k	  origin/structure
 yoh	what are remote branches in case of SVN? ;)
 yoh	is that already on a clone?
 sonney2k	yes
 yoh	what if on the server in that git directory you do: git --bare branch
 yoh	in any case -- not a biggie since number of branches is small so you could just check them out manually locally before doing the rewrite, or you could just copy that git directory as your .git into a directory to mimique local clone I guess... let me check
 sonney2k	yoh, can I do that without risk?
 sonney2k	yoh, no copying does not work
 yoh	risk of what? just keep a copy of it for your sanity sake ;)
 yoh	ok chief -- give me a tarball of that repository and I will do ;)
 sonney2k	yoh, ahh well - I only have hundreds of copies
 yoh	copying works -- just need few changes in config
 yoh	switch from bare to non-bare and remove shared flag as well so it looks like a local clone with a checkout tree, then do git checkout master upstairs (i.e. in the directory where you copied that directory as .git)
 sonney2k	well it is this one http://shogun-toolbox.org/gitweb/?p=shogun.git;a=summary
 yoh	right, but I can't scp it "for completeness"
 sonney2k	yoh, I see. I am creating a tarball.
 yoh	if I clone (which I have from github) lazy me would  need to do those manual checkouts of all 4!!! remote branches ;)
 sonney2k	does github also have the remote branches?
 yoh	gkhm... use of "remote branches" confuses me ;) whatever is a branch on github locally would be a remote branch for me whenever github is added as a remote (e.g. origin by default)
 sonney2k	yoh, well the branches on shogun-toolbox :)
 yoh	so yes -- it ha sthem all I guess
 yoh	* master remotes/gh-yarikoptic-temp/master remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master remotes/origin/boost_serialization remotes/origin/galaxy remotes/origin/master remotes/origin/structure
 sonney2k	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/sg-git.tar
 sonney2k	there you go
 yoh	ok -- gimme a few minutes of joy and waiting ;) will probably do on the box with a few cores (git repack I believe is multithreaded)
 yoh	so it wasn't even shared -- you could have problems with multiple people committing under their own logins...
 sonney2k	?
 yoh	for "push" rights into the repository by different people
 yoh	https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#How_do_I_share_a_git_public_repository_and_use_it_in_a_CVS_way.3F
 sonney2k	I still don't understand - no idea what you are talking about
 yoh	whenever you init git repo, you could use 'git init --shared'

 yoh	someone would need to check what would need to be adjusted to switch existing one to shared mode -- I recall that few things needs to be twicked... or it will be noone but you directly pushing into that repository on shogun-toolbox.org via ssh?
 yoh	so -- those files you listed in the email are the only ones to be removed?
 sonney2k	yoh, I intend to give a handful of people push rights...
 sonney2k	I didn't even know that there is a difference in git for this setup...
 yoh	well -- if you take github as the primary one, you could easily setup different groups with different rights (eg pushing)
 sonney2k	yoh, well I suggest to grep for .bz2 files the files might have occurred under different paths / names
 yoh	but all that will be easy to fix anyways... so no worries...  ok -- so all those listed + bz2, right?
 sonney2k	yoh, yes
 sonney2k	I just checked again. the biggest ones are the ones in the asp dir (or asplicer at some previous point)
 sonney2k	and the ones from the msplicer dir
 sonney2k	there are lots of others that are slightly big when uncompressed but small when compressed (test suite) so no need to remove them
 yoh	ok -- filterbranch is running
 yoh	I just did that list + any .bz2 ... or do you mean that some bz2 should have been saved?
 sonney2k	yoh, if I get this right this will only remove the commits with the files right?
 yoh	no -- commits will be there -- just without those files ;) so if commit was only about those files -- it will be empty commit
 yoh	those could be skipped if you like (I recall there is aprameter)
 sonney2k	no they can all go
-!- sergey_lisitsyn [6de2681f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.109.226.104.31] has joined #shogun
 sonney2k	that is what I meant :)
 sergey_lisitsyn	hello
 sonney2k	yoh, regarding github - I currently want to turn this into my primary source
 sonney2k	but still I'd like to have shogun-toolbox.org's git to be a up-to-date mirror
 sonney2k	sergey_lisitsyn, hi...
 yoh	sonney2k: no problem, you can push changes to as many remotes as you like -- you just need a habbit (or helper tool) to do so
 sonney2k	yoh, can I in github configure branches that only the respective student has push access for?
 sonney2k	yoh, well I could also have a cron job doing this on shogun-toolbox.org
 yoh	do you mean per-branch? ... in any case-- I would recommend github because it makes it really easy for people to work on their own clones (so your students just clone your repo directly on github into their accounts) and then for you to see the 'Network'
 sergey_lisitsyn	sonney2k: a little question: that description on shogun GSoC page was long ago or it appeared recently? I'm confused that I haven't seen it before
 yoh	so no need to grant students push access
 sonney2k	yoh, I see
 yoh	let them push into their very own clones
 yoh	then add them as remotes to your own local checkout and you will be able to merge or cherry-pick hteir changes
 sonney2k	sergey_lisitsyn, err sorry? I don't understand the question.
 yoh	and on github they could submit official pull requests for such merges... and github provides convenient code-review facilities so you could discuss those right there in place
 sergey_lisitsyn	sonney2k: that one: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/shogun
 sonney2k	sergey_lisitsyn, we had this description in the application template form. Since I couldn't find a link to this in the new melange I included this in the raw description.
 sergey_lisitsyn	sonney2k: okay, thank you
 sonney2k	sergey_lisitsyn, so yes it is 'new' on this page but old otherwise
 sonney2k	yoh, sounds cool
 sergey_lisitsyn	I think I forgot to make acquaintance :)
 sonney2k	yoh, the only thing that worries me is that if someone deletes his account/repository that I don't have anything...
 sonney2k	(I mean maliciously... of course I have high hopes that won't happen)
 sonney2k	yoh, btw, please email me the git commands you have issued once you are done...
 sergey_lisitsyn	sonney2k: may I ask another question?
 sonney2k	sergey_lisitsyn, just ask
 sergey_lisitsyn	okay :) so, will students commit code right in that svn trunk or it will be some another way?
