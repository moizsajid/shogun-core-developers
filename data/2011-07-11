@sonney2k	hi heiko
 heiko	hi sonney2k
 bettyboo	heiko, smoochy
@sonney2k	if you have small patches to merge already - would be nice
@sonney2k	(not to get such a big one in the end again)
 heiko	yes I got a lot
@sonney2k	I was afraid of that
 heiko	the problem is when I touch one part, the others will not work anymore
 heiko	so I ended up in lots of changes again this time
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah I know my bad...
 heiko	currently everything in libshogun is working
 heiko	but my python stuff is not
 heiko	perhaps I already send this and correct?
@sonney2k	heiko, but that is already worth a pull request
 heiko	ok then here it comes:
@sonney2k	and you python code is new anyways and not used so far...
 heiko	ok sent
 heiko	nearly all changes are in my own classes
 heiko	and the examples do work with this base
 heiko	Next, there will be some interface changes
 heiko	with the DynArray vs DynamicObjectArray stuff:
 heiko	I would like to stay with DynArray internally for now, because it works and is memory neutral.
 heiko	I will only change the methods that interact with python
 heiko	to get the example wokring this week
@sonney2k	heiko, why did you not use SGObject's for DynamicObjectArray but made it templated?
 heiko	and then stepwise change the internal stuff (like tree multiplication and stuff) later
* blackburn wants to run from his country
 heiko	because of type safety
 heiko	remember, we talked about this a few days ago
 heiko	?
@sonney2k	heiko, I don't understand
@sonney2k	type safety?
@sonney2k	now you can pass arbitrary objects to the dynamicobjectarray - right?
@sonney2k	so types can be off
 heiko	now, I added runtime checks that these are only CSGObjects
 heiko	but now I can call methods on the elements
@sonney2k	if you directly use SGObject then these checks are not necessary
 heiko	without having to cast
 heiko	if I do the non-generic variant I would always have to cast an element of the array to its actual type
 heiko	What I wanted to do is something similar to:
 heiko	java:
@sonney2k	I understand the problem
 heiko	DynamicObjectArray<T extends CSGObject>
@sonney2k	though we have done the same for lists
@sonney2k	err I meant to say in lists we do it with SGObject and now in the array not
@sonney2k	that is confusing
@sonney2k	I see the benefits but also the cons
 heiko	Both solutions end in runtime errors if used wrong
 heiko	mmh, well I could change it again, but the template solutions saves you from casting, and also if one would like to have an CSGObject array, one could do by setting T=CSGObject
 heiko	I have a lunch date now, are you still there in one hour?

 heiko	ok, I will do this this noon

 heiko	ModelSelectionParameters and ParameterCombination

@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	heiko, ^
 heiko	hej
 heiko	about this template vs cast stuff
 heiko	I use the structure at lots of places in my get_combinations code
 heiko	also nested templates
 heiko	and if I put away the template (what I just did) this becomes really messy
 heiko	like an array of arrays of Parametercombinations
 heiko	and no type safety
 heiko	I really like the typed stuff more
 heiko	I think there are just lots of traps when it is not typed
 heiko	which I do not see if its the other way round
 heiko	Also, I do not understand what speaks for the "weak typed" variant. Are there any advantages?
-!- in3xes_ [~in3xes@59.163.196.121] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	heiko, when you do dynamic_casts should you not also check fot std::bad_cast ?
@sonney2k	heiko, otherwise OK then your code :)
 heiko	but dynamic_cast returns NULL if it fails or not?
@sonney2k	seems not, http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071106101012AAggZAk
 heiko	oh ok, for references
 heiko	I only cast pointers
@sonney2k	I see

@sonney2k	heiko,  I couldn't compile with python
@sonney2k	I applied some minor fixes to get it to work.
 sploving1	sonney2k,
@sonney2k	sploving1, ?
 sploving1	 javac ../../examples/undocumented/java_modular/classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.java
 sploving1	my dir is testsuite/java_modular
 sploving1	then .class file is generated in testsuite/java_modular dir
 sploving1	then I use java classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular
 sploving1	it said: Unable to create matrix from ../data/fm_train_real.dat: ../data/fm_train_real.dat (No such file or directory)
 sploving1	sonney2k, any idea?
 sploving1	sonney2k, now I am testing generator.java
 sploving1	I think the class file should be generated in the undocumented/java_modular dir
 sploving1	then it can find the file

@sonney2k	heiko, does python modular compile for you now?
@sonney2k	and can you run a very minimal example?
 heiko	I already had this wokring, but will try now.
 heiko	was already building a more complex example until i came to changing this data structure :)
@sonney2k	I had to remove the %template to get it to compile
@sonney2k	and doxygen dir was worng
 heiko	yes just, check it, sorry
 heiko	ah ok I did disable doxygen
@sonney2k	no worries
 heiko	that was the reason
 heiko	Currently I am changing the last steps for usage of the new array
 heiko	then hopefully the example will run
 heiko	after so much time :)
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	looking forward to it :)
 heiko	me too :)
 heiko	ha, finally compiles :D
 heiko	after 1mio type and referencing changes :)
 heiko	argh, assert error :(
 heiko	sonney2k, has shogun the possibility to print a stack trace?
 heiko	currently I am doing this via valgrind
 heiko	int*a; delete a;
 heiko	which produces one :)
 heiko	but is there an elegant way?
