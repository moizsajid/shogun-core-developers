@knrrrd	Exceptional good weather in Berlin!
@knrrrd	Don't waste your time on IRC :)
* sonney2k is doing his tax declaration
* sonney2k sighs
@sonney2k	bettyboo, knrrrd is enjoying the Berlin sun - dont you think that is fair?
@bettyboo	sonney2k: so the implementation of kfa does not requires any special kernel or feature representation
@sonney2k	:D
@knrrrd	you see, bettyboo is also working (on shogun of course)
@bettyboo	knrrrd: each vector of this basis is a linear combination of all training examples
@sonney2k	it is always good to have a bot doing some real work - even though its name is bettyboo *heh*
@bettyboo	sonney2k: i have been working with svm
@sonney2k	bettyboo, I am pretty sure of that.
@bettyboo	sonney2k: I am not sure what KFA does
@bettyboo	lol.
@knrrrd	Added a new matching routine which randomly kicks in and looks for a similar phrase
@knrrrd	Cleaned my balcony today. Hard work with a Schrubber!
@sonney2k	knrrrd, you really are working hard - I mean it :)
@bettyboo	;D
@sonney2k	knrrrd, It is hard to believe, but you can have a PhD a.k.a. Dr. and still be childish^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hperform very relevant social experiments..!
* sonney2k just compiles shogun for all potentially available interfaces
* sonney2k just to check if the temperature of my CPU goes beyond 90 deg. C or actually which language is most demanding. So far octave wins...
@knrrrd	I don't get the social experiment part?

 CIA-30	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r9842cfe / src/modular/SGBase.i :
 CIA-30	shogun: Ignore a few more sg_* functions in modular interfaces.
 CIA-30	shogun: This fixes a r_modular build failure. - http://bit.ly/gLgrWt
 CIA-30	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4bd3981 / (src/libshogun/lib/DataType.cpp src/libshogun/lib/DataType.h):
 CIA-30	shogun: Don't call the return value result as this clashes with swig's R
 CIA-30	shogun: wrapping (calling return SEXPptr's result). - http://bit.ly/eNf0qj
@knrrrd	bettyboo: Do you understand these git logs?
@bettyboo	knrrrd: Tanmoy, I don't understand your question...
@bettyboo	knrrrd, zzz
@knrrrd	Oops
@knrrrd	bettyboo: I am not Tanmoy
@bettyboo	knrrrd: I am not sure what KFA does
 Tanmoy	@bettyboo for the part in missing algorithms i talked about KPCA
@bettyboo	Tanmoy: I think there's an issue about this somewhere
 Tanmoy	LLE,ISOMAP
 Tanmoy	what are the preprocessing methods there
 Tanmoy	in shogun

 Tanmoy	@sonney2k well its actually mentioned that there are a whole lot of preprocessing methods available that would complement the features in shogun
 Tanmoy	@knrrrd which question didn't u understand ?
