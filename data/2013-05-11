@sonney2k	dvalcarce, or which branch is it?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, classification branch should work
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I can take a screenshot if you want

@sonney2k	dvalcarce, hmmh I am on classification branch
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, which method then?
@sonney2k	https://github.com/dvalcarce/shogun-web/branches
@sonney2k	it says last updated 13 days ago?
 dvalcarce	13 days ago? hmm...
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, try now
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, ok now I see the colorbar
@sonney2k	though it still needs some numbers :D
@sonney2k	but no contour
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I will add the numbers
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, hmmh  multiclass is broken now?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, multiclass works fine to me
@sonney2k	weird
-!- goldbug [~quassel@global-2-1.nat.csx.cam.ac.uk] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@sonney2k	if you have time please do a real contour like in http://www.idlcoyote.com/tips/contour_user_selected.jpg
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, do you receive some error message?
@sonney2k	I don't know how hard this is with d3 / or whether anyone has done it
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, no the result is just crap
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, browser?

 dvalcarce	sonney2k, binary classification has the same contour plotting as the perceptron
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: where did you get that pic!!!!! :D
@lisitsyn	that's windows 95 for real!
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, but perceptron countor plotting is ugly: just parallel lines
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31480471/bad-mc.png
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, google contour plot
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, yes colors & lines for 0 / 1 / or so
@sonney2k	without knowing the f(x)=0 contour line it is not clear where the decision boundary really is
@sonney2k	alright people I have to sleep
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, please fixzebugz
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: which?
@sonney2k	FA
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: already?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, don't you see something like https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web/pull/27#issuecomment-17746979 ?

@sonney2k	dvalcarce, yes but what am I seeing there?
@sonney2k	I meant black contour lines
@sonney2k	and below that the  *smooth* colors
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, black?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, I have to find how to do that in D3js then

@sonney2k	pickle27, dvalcarce, van51 btw which timezone are you in?
 pickle27	sonney2k: Canada - EDT
* gsomix is tired. *bad, bad git* :(
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, Madrid CET
 van51	sonney2k: athens or UTC+2
 gsomix	nite
@sonney2k	ok so we should not have cheng in too :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, recall last year when we had our monthly meetings and it was already late at night for cheng while chris had to get up at 7 or so?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: haha yes
@lisitsyn	we were basically
@lisitsyn	-8 to +8
@sonney2k	australia vs new york (city)
@sonney2k	we could totally screw that with olvier (california)
 van51	I think I would mind more the getting up at 7 :p
@sonney2k	and cheng
@sonney2k	van51, it is 00:28 here
@sonney2k	so 18:28 at your place
@sonney2k	6 hrs
@lisitsyn	lucky you 02:28 here
@sonney2k	if we had a meeting at 13:00
@sonney2k	it would indeed be 7 am for you
 van51	no, 00:28 sounds fine
 van51	:p
@wiking	sonney2k: how should a load and save method look like for a preprocessor
@sonney2k	not when you have to get up in 5 hours :D
@sonney2k	wiking, a what?
@sonney2k	I guess that is obsolete
 gsomix	sonney2k, sorry for another PR. I have problems with "amending".
@wiking	sonney2k: is it?
@wiking	sonney2k: somehow i need to serialize some parameters of the preprocessor
@sonney2k	gsomix, jsut do git reset --soft <version>

@wiking	sonney2k: and then save/load functions will be handled automagically? :)
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, maybe you can add contour lines on top? I have no clue what conrac.js is

@sonney2k	load and save should die
@wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll remove
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, ok. I'll try it next time. :(
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I like gsomix' label factory patch
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I like it too, just naming
@lisitsyn	it is not factory
@sonney2k	what else then?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, LabelUtils?

@lisitsyn	I'd call it so
@lisitsyn	gsomix: ^
@lisitsyn	I like short names but Utils doesn't tell the user what it does
@wiking	why do i get segfault for sg_adding a SGVector? :)

@wiking	lisitsyn: to hide the actual compilation command
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	yeah tomorrow
@wiking	ok so now the rescalefeature should actually work :P
@wiking	cool
@lisitsyn	wiking: are you still using clang_complete?
@lisitsyn	I just updated and I noticed it is faster now
@wiking	it's cool that we have now already 86 tests in unit tests

@lisitsyn	finally
 pickle27	hey is there any docs on how to build the test suit for unit tests?
@lisitsyn	pickle27: build unit tests or what?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I am trying to build and run the unit tests to see of the new one I'm working on works
@lisitsyn	pickle27: make in shogun/tests/unit
@lisitsyn	does it for you
@wiking	lisitsyn: didn't hide swig compilation
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah I know
@lisitsyn	wiking: but hey I said jumping works
@lisitsyn	:D
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yes but what version of gtest and gmock because the build is failing
@lisitsyn	pickle27: error?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: gtest/test/gtest_unittest.cc:69:36: fatal error: src/gtest-internal-inl.h: No such file or directory
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I just downloaded gtest and gmock and copied them to /usr/src
@lisitsyn	pickle27: did you reconfigure after that?
 pickle27	yup
 pickle27	lisitsyn: they both showed up as recognized after ./config
@lisitsyn	pickle27: so /usr/src/gtest/src/gtest-internal-inl.h exists
@lisitsyn	?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yes
@lisitsyn	pickle27: no idea then :D
@lisitsyn	pickle27: just check they are included
@lisitsyn	pickle27: shogun/src/.config should have
@lisitsyn	GTEST_DIR
@lisitsyn	GMOCK_DIR
@lisitsyn	set to /usr/src/gtest
@lisitsyn	and /usr/src/gmock
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah thats what they are set to
@lisitsyn	pickle27: sorry I am powering off just like sonney2k now
 pickle27	lisitsyn: no worries I'll try and figure this out!
@lisitsyn	pickle27: this error means one thing - include paths are not here
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I'm trying a rebuild now and I'll take another look at exactly what it was building]

 van51	the weirder thing is that it suddenly started last night :S
 shogun-buildbot	build #1151 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1151  blamelist: Evgeniy Andreev <gsomix@gmail.com>
@wiking	van51: i guess it's because you upgraded to HEAD of the repo
@sonney2k	gsomix, you label everything WIP so how could I figure this out?
@wiking	van51: can u paste on file's compilation line.... ?
@wiking	lisitsyn: how do i turn off this 'hide compilation mode'
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm. I usually say when it's ready to merge...
 gsomix	sonney2k, sorry. I'll try to be more careful with WIP tag.
 van51	wiking: if you mean the line of the error, then there is nothing more to the output
@wiking	lisitsyn: "We just can't be fucked to implement C11 support, and variadic templates were just too hard to implement in a year. (But ohmygosh we turned "^" into a reference-counted pointer operator. Oh, and what's a reference cycle?) " :D

 van51	it re-enters the directory
 van51	and says that it is compiling
 van51	but if I run any test after that, it fails with a segfault
@sonney2k	gsomix, well now it is too late fix the rest ASAP
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha, I'm fixing now.
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, what do you think about "LabelsCast" naming?

@iglesiasg	gsomix: let met ask you
@iglesiasg	why is it necessary to add gsomix the declaractions class CLabels, CBinaryLabels, etc in LabelsFactory.h
@iglesiasg	I never really understand it
@iglesiasg	although I think it is required
 gsomix	iglesiasg, it's just predeclaration. I have included LabelsFactory.h in Labels.h - at this moment BinaryLabels and etc. are not really defined.
 gsomix	iglesiasg, btw, it seems, that CLabels declaration is not necessary.
 gsomix	iglesiasg, ah, nope. It's needed too.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: aham, I see it. I didn't notice BinaryLabels.h, etc are not included.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: I think there is something related to SWIG that makes you have to do it even if you include them
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, now it's really WIP.
 gsomix	sonney2k, once it is ready, I will write to you and will remove tag "WIP".

@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yeah lets just do simplest
