@HeikoS	lisitsyn: details please
@HeikoS	out of core?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm like
 lisitsyn	you see some example
 lisitsyn	get gradient
 lisitsyn	you return this gradient thing
 lisitsyn	and you can apply this gradient to model
@HeikoS	stochastic gradient descent
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	yes Wu is implementing this
 lisitsyn	I mean architecture-wise
@HeikoS	google: GP for Big data
 lisitsyn	you don't hide this thing happening
@HeikoS	needs some approximations to the model but that can be done
 lisitsyn	inside your code
 lisitsyn	but you return updates
 lisitsyn	and you can apply updates
@HeikoS	plain GP is batch only though
@HeikoS	yeah might be a good idea
 lisitsyn	so you can learn on spark/storm blablba
@HeikoS	maybe tell WU?
@HeikoS	dont see that?
 lisitsyn	yeah I can try to check what's going on with gps
 lisitsyn	I can hardly follow though :D
 lisitsyn	you guys do some things I don't really get
