 heiko	sonney2k, the debug messages are still gone, makes it hard to debug :)
 blackburn	heiko: why?
 heiko	blackburn:  why what? :)
 blackburn	heiko: debug messages are gone
 heiko	because debug messages help me understanding whats going on :)
 heiko	no idea
 heiko	they disappeared
 heiko	but I do sg_io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG) in the beginning of the program
 blackburn	heiko: did you try to remove that branch prediction in SGIO?
 blackburn	heiko: what is your compiler?
 heiko	blackburn: no, I dont want to go into that, I hoped that rather one of you guys known whats going on there
 heiko	gcc version 4.7.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-2ubuntu1)
 blackburn	heiko: shogun/io/SGIO.h:80
 blackburn	replace it with contents of line 82
 heiko	I iwll try
 heiko	blackburn:  thanks
 blackburn	it should not cause it but who knows.. world is so surprising
 heiko	blackburn: currently trying to find the bug that nona pointed out
 heiko	its a weird little thing
 heiko	alphas and bias of both svm is the same, but results are not, currently checking the obvious things
 blackburn	heiko: oh yeah I was scaried with her mail I am so happy you take it
 heiko	and fixed a mem leak in ROCEvaluation on the way :)
 heiko	scaried?
 heiko	scared you mean?
 heiko	why?
 blackburn	jk
 blackburn	scared yes
 blackburn	well static
 blackburn	I don't like complex bugs :D
 heiko	blackburn, yes static sucks :)
 heiko	blackburn
 heiko	do I have to do anything else than
 heiko	init_shogun_with_defaults();
 heiko	sg_io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG);
 heiko	to enable the debug messages?
 blackburn	heiko: enjoying [tab] autocompletion? :)
 heiko	these are the first lines of my code
 blackburn	heiko: no should work
 heiko	blackburn: yes
 heiko	no it doesnt and replacing the lines also doenst
 blackburn	heiko: can you name some example for me to try?
 heiko	anyway, I will use the debugger for now
 heiko	blackburn: I will, but let me finish this here first
 blackburn	heiko: it doesn't work only sometimes right?
 heiko	currently it does not at all, but I remember yes sometimes it did
 blackburn	heiko: ok let me try basic example then
 heiko	ok
 blackburn	heiko: will you have some time to 'review' my paper before submission next week?
 heiko	ehm, sure :)
 heiko	blackburn: what is it about? I can read it over the weekend
 blackburn	heiko: tapkee
 heiko	I see, nice
 heiko	I am not too fluent in that, but I will try my best
 blackburn	heiko: general words
 blackburn	jmlr mloss is just some words anyway
 heiko	blackburn: ok sure send it!
 blackburn	heiko: once it gets in better state
 heiko	ok
 heiko	blackburn: how do I force one thread?
 heiko	blackburn: how do I get sg_parallel?
 heiko	found it :)
 blackburn	heiko: sorry was afk
 heiko	blackburn: found the nona bug
 heiko	CustomKernel bug
 heiko	CCustomKernel::kernel method mixes up indices and changes kernel matrix ordering
 blackburn	heiko: oops
 heiko	it is *very* good that we spotted that, I am using this all the time  :-o
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	heiko: will you fix it?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	heiko: I had to call my bank when you asked me - I noticed one transaction has a comment ORA-20300 :D
 blackburn	heiko: I don't know if you are the unhappy guy who knows what ORA-**** means
 heiko	what? :)
 heiko	I dont get it
 blackburn	heiko: oracle database errors are marked as ORA-*****
 blackburn	so you never had to work with PL/SQL and oracle I guess :)
 blackburn	heiko: okay totally forgot to try debug
 blackburn	trying now
 blackburn	heiko: works here..

@sonney2k	heiko, whats wrong with the matlab interface?
@sonney2k	heiko, whats wrong with debug messages?
@sonney2k	and finally what is wrong with custom kernel? I've been using this lots and lots of times though not recently...
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I still haven't gotten any feedback from gunnar :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: he is talking to gunnar right now
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	blackburn, well then cwidmer talk to gunnar - no need that I do it then :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what should gunnar feedback about?
