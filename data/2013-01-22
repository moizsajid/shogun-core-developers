@sonney2k	blackburn, hey there
* sonney2k feels like party time ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, announce stuff like hell...
 blackburn	sonney2k: hey
 blackburn	sonney2k: so we are going to have some party time? :D
@sonney2k	yeah but it will be some work to make it BIG
 blackburn	no problem lets do it
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need to do some planning
@sonney2k	the usual suspects want to help so we should have some chat brainstorming
@sonney2k	somewhen this week
 blackburn	I am available mostly
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I cannot figure out why the gp example suddenly crashes
@sonney2k	blackburn, seems like m_parametersi in SGObject is not inited
@sonney2k	but that is not possible
@sonney2k	since it is explicitly done in constructor
@sonney2k	any off the train...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't know - will try to debug once I get some time
 blackburn	sonne|work: it seems that I should go as a tourist to avoid visa troubles :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: sure you should :)

 sonne|work	heiko: seems you forgot to twitter?
 heiko	sonne|work, have a look
 sonne|work	our marketing deparment seriously lacks :D
 sonne|work	ohh there
 sonne|work	and the perl one ?
 heiko	I thought maybe wait another day to not flood it
 heiko	?
 heiko	but no idea if that is sensible, just my personal feeling
 sonne|work	just push it out
 sonne|work	otherwise it will just be forgotten like last time
 heiko	you are right
 heiko	sonne|work , so the basics are working right?
 sonne|work	we should create some extra page for the workshop
 sonne|work	yes
 heiko	sonne|work, I think it would be a good idea to have an IRC meeting about the workshop
 sonne|work	heiko: I just said that to blackburn
 heiko	ok
 heiko	already got a date?
 sonne|work	no but maybe tomorrow evening?
 sonne|work	heiko: where should I put the workshop link? under shogun-toolbox.org/events/workshop2013?
 heiko	sonne|work yes that is good
 sonne|work	heiko: I mean when you look at the current website
 heiko	damn, I should have put that into the twitter
 sonne|work	I would add a new tab
 sonne|work	events
 sonne|work	and then beneath that the info
 heiko	yes
 sonne|work	heiko: we will need to write some official announcement anyways
 sonne|work	with details about program
 sonne|work	this currently is just planning phase
 heiko	okay
 heiko	sonne|work, is it hard to insert a twitter stream on the website?
 sonne|work	any idea for a cool name for our workshop
 heiko	puh, good question
 sonne|work	like: shogun toolbox days 2013 - give your data a treat ;-)
 heiko	unexperienced in workshop names :)
 heiko	well thats not too bad
 heiko	sonne|work, what about today evening?
 blackburn	re

 heiko	hehe
 blackburn	heiko: so you will visit berlin too, right?
 blackburn	wiking: what about you and how are you?
 heiko	blackburn, yes, already marked it in my calendar, need to sort out with job, but that should be no problem

 heiko	ah you wrote on the list already
 heiko	so finally, all of us will meet :)
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 blackburn	heiko: I should find some travel offer that works for me

 sonne|work	heiko: looks like your c-base announcement got retweeted!
 heiko	sonne|work, I saw it, but c-base and sergey do not really count ;)
 sonne|work	why does c-base not count?
 sonne|work	~4k followers
 heiko	if one of them re-tweet, then it counts
 sonne|work	if one of them attends it counts already
 sonne|work	btw I posted this also on G+'s  (>3000 followers in ML group)
 heiko	thats very cool!
 heiko	the TUB guys could also advertise it at uni
 heiko	as could the t?bingen people
 sonne|work	then there is still planet.d.o
 heiko	oh yes
 blackburn	if it gets big I will run horrored :D
 heiko	I will write a blogpost soon, once things are a bit more set
 heiko	hehe :)
 heiko	So what about registration
 heiko	If we made this compulsory (but free of charge) then we would know how many people might be there
 blackburn	I don't mind

 blackburn	hah no more github in china
-!- Hausas [~admin@unaffiliated/hausas] has quit []
 wiking	heheh we need to make them an unofficial mirror of shogun somewhere else ;)
 blackburn	wiking: what for?
 wiking	maybe they'd like to have shogun as well but they cannot clone it
 wiking	(chinese researchers)
 blackburn	google code
 blackburn	but in general we should recall that principle wiking
 blackburn	the F U principle
 wiking	:))))))))))))
 blackburn	so we should put 'if you can't use github ... '
-!- blackburn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 sonne|work	wiking: shogun-toolbox.org / google code are also official mirrors
 sonne|work	heiko: yes we will require registration. could anyone draft a form for that for our webserver?
 heiko	sonne|work, I have no idea how to do these things, what about the guy who did the page?
 sonne|work	heiko: I just need some form design. doing that then on the website is not a problem for me. not sure if we need it but if we get say 50 emails then we will simply loose track
 heiko	sonne|work, but what do you  need then? the form should have two elements: name, email ??
 sonne|work	what else?
 sonne|work	country/city/institution/...?
 heiko	yes, these would be good
