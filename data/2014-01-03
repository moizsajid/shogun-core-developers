@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yep, in case you use apply_structured that is true
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, even with apply() !
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, try it
@iglesiasg	oh really!? let mesee
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, true, indeed
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, well, the fix here then is not to use to_structured I guess
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, where is that handled though?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, that the return value is casted to structured labels
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, SWIG code?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, in Machine.i  - yes swig code
@sonney2k	pretty cool uh?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yep
@iglesiasg	haha yeah
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so please commit the fix that doesn't use this conversion
@sonney2k	I will nevertheless
@sonney2k	add %newobject to all methods in CLabelsFactory
@iglesiasg	why so?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, don't we get a leak then?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	it will return the object but ref'd
@sonney2k	so if the refcount was 0 before it will be 1 now
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but that is right when doing to_structured(apply())
@iglesiasg	what if doing?
@iglesiasg	var =  apply()
@sonney2k	also then
@iglesiasg	to_structured(var)
@sonney2k	var.ref_count() should be 1 right?
@sonney2k	and then
@sonney2k	var2= to_structured(var)
@sonney2k	var2's refcount should be 2
@sonney2k	because you have 2 references
@iglesiasg	yep, right
@iglesiasg	out of curiosity
@iglesiasg	var = to_structured(var)
@iglesiasg	what would it happen there? mmm
@sonney2k	var would just be converted to type CStructuredLabels
@sonney2k	and refcount would be 1
@iglesiasg	about var2's refcount being 2, and var's refcount 1 in the setting before
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but now you know why we always do SG_REF when returning some object (except for new ones...)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: use %newobject on label factory functions to fix premature memory freeing
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, alright nice teamwork nailing this down :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, well it feels I didn't actually help much :D
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if you have time - scan the code for similar scary patterns...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, finding the exact line is half of the work!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I just see one to_* in python_modular examples
@iglesiasg	in one factor graph example from Shell too
@iglesiasg	this is done in two steps so the crash did not pop up
@iglesiasg	but I guess it is nicer without the cast so I will take it out
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but there might be more in the C++ code ... functions that take some object as input and return it without the ref increased or functions returning object w/o increasing the refcount
@sonney2k	that is more subtle to find... so in case you have time have a look
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am not sure why the first case should increase the ref count though :S
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and please update the NEWS about this bug
@sonney2k	so we are now in release shape
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I mean, a function takes an object in the input, why should it do SG_REF of this?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, it should not only if it returns it and then only in the modular interfaces
@iglesiasg	okok
@iglesiasg	so
@sonney2k	I am overdue with going to bed so be quick
@iglesiasg	p* f(p*)
@iglesiasg	should use this %newobject thing
@iglesiasg	that's it

@sonney2k	returning a new object
@iglesiasg	unit-SGVectorTest failed?!
@sonney2k	and the others that return a reference should do SG_REF()

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw did you get my email about this? I am just wondering...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, about the buildbot fail? No, I didn't
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no the reply to your mail today
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, got it today about three hours ago
@iglesiasg	2 hours actually, 21:55, just checked it
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, why do you wonder about it? Did you send it before that today?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, just added a line in NEWS https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1808/files
@iglesiasg	just merge it please if that's how you wanted it
