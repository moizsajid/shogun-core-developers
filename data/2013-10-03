@iglesiasg	hey hushell
@iglesiasg	hushell, how are you doing?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I just modified something, testing, I'll push the commit in few mins :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, all right
@iglesiasg	hushell, just wanted to say that yesterday we were discussing about this get_energies method in CFactor
@iglesiasg	hushell, get_energies was it IIRC. So there is a const version and a non-const one
 hushell	iglesiasg: yes, something wrong with it?
@iglesiasg	hushell, are both of them actually used? Otherwise, it might a good idea to remove one of them (probably the non-const one as it is a getter)
@iglesiasg	hushell, well, it is still code duplication that I am not sure whether it pays off -- I am not very sure about where having both methods actually is necessary
@iglesiasg	hushell, and also lisitsyn mentioned there is some warning in modular interfaces
@iglesiasg	since not every language understand the const keyword
@iglesiasg	I guess they understand the method is defined twice
@iglesiasg	the warning could be probably avoided using some #ifdef SWIG blah blah though
 hushell	iglesiasg: I was trying to use get_energies() to modify the energy table, but in the end I realized I should avoid this, not remember very clear
@iglesiasg	hushell, aham all right
 hushell	I'll check if I had something like this
@iglesiasg	hushell, to me it seems like a good idea to remove the non-const method
 hushell	yes, we could delete one of them
 hushell	git fetch upstream doesn't work ...
@iglesiasg	ouch
@iglesiasg	it is not working here either
 hushell	iglesiasg: well, seems github had problem
 hushell	iglesiasg: no way to push now, I'll do it a bit later :/
@iglesiasg	hushell, sure, no hurries
@iglesiasg	hushell, what is it you are pushing?
