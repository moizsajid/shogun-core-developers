 n4nd0	one question
 n4nd0	I am setting up the address fernando@shogu... from gmail
 n4nd0	and it is required to verify the mail address using a link sent to that address
 n4nd0	is there any place where the mails sent to an address shogun-toolbox.org can be seen?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I expect they will get right to your mail
 n4nd0	blackburn: where can we check the mail of the shogun-toolbox.org accounts?
 blackburn	there is no such thing - it is just a redirect I think
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	so I am either using the wrong shogun-toolbox.org mail address or there is some problem with the redirect
 blackburn	why?
 blackburn	I sent you a mai
 n4nd0	I didn't get anything
 n4nd0	to what address did you send it?
 n4nd0	fernando@shogun... ?
 n4nd0	blackburn: ping
 blackburn	n4nd0: pong
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sorry :)
 n4nd0	hehe np :)
 blackburn	fernando@shogun-toolbox.org
 n4nd0	so let's ask sonney2k if that is the right address and if the redirection is done
 blackburn	n4nd0: ha! pca in tapkee is wrong :D
 n4nd0	uups
 n4nd0	blackburn: where does it fail?
 blackburn	I forgot to subtract mean
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	fixing
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	crazy things in brazil
 n4nd0	blackburn: such as?
 blackburn	n4nd0: some fire in night club, ~200 has died

@sonney2k	blackburn, check your inbox when I sent around the emails to you
@sonney2k	that's where your addresses are in
 blackburn	gut
 blackburn	sonney2k: fernando.iglesias is the mail I guess :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://lisitsyn.github.com/tapkee/methods/lle.html does that button on top look ok with your browser?
@sonney2k	blackburn, a bit weird
@sonney2k	text is not centered
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah it is because it reserves some place for pic
 blackburn	but the text is in the button?
 blackburn	n4nd0 said once that it goes out of button
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, what email address do we use: shogun-workshop2013@ ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: looks ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, I subscribe you with your shogun-toolbox.org address
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok! let me prepare the form
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have time to talk about fields of the form?
@sonney2k	blackburn, just do some draft - then lets talk
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFoS0Q2U19qYkdjT2VReFNvNDBoclE6MQ
 blackburn	the very draft
 blackburn	tell me what do you think
 blackburn	sonney2k: done

 n4nd0	I don't get anything on fernando.iglesias@shogun-toolbox.org either
 blackburn	n4nd0: sent test
 n4nd0	 blackburn I got yours!
 n4nd0	how is it possible that I didn't get the one I sent?
 n4nd0	mm probably I misspelled
 blackburn	heh probably
 blackburn	n4nd0: check this out - I set up a redirect
 blackburn	http://lisitsyn.github.com
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please help me filling that page?
 n4nd0	oh I see, nice
 n4nd0	blackburn: the methods that have no info yet I guess?
 blackburn	n4nd0: just to know - you can set up your own homepage like n4nd0.github.com with creating a repo named 'n4nd0.github.com'
 blackburn	ah you have iglesias at github
 n4nd0	good to know indeed!
 blackburn	n4nd0: if you have time I'd appreciate if you describe SPE
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: just switch (or better clone again and switch) to gh_pages branch
