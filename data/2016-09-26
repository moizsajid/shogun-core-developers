@wiking	HeikoS: i've turned off appveyor for all the branches except feature/windows
@wiking	we have a bug in threading crossvalidation
@HeikoS	wiking: cook!
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	(on windows it deadlocks and never retunrs)
@HeikoS	wiking: got a log?
@HeikoS	ah wow
@HeikoS	I wonder what that is
@wiking	log, no? app veyor never stops
@wiking	because the unit test gets stuck in case of libsvm
@wiking	in case of KNN the assertation fails when threading is enabled
@HeikoS	no idea what that can be
@HeikoS	know anything about threading in windows?
@HeikoS	wiking: btw what about the bnb email?
