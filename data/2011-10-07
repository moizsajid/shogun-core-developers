@sonney2k	blackburn, hi
 blackburn	sonney2k: hi
@sonney2k	I have my system hopefully working by the end of tomorrow :)
@sonney2k	windows / osx are working too
 blackburn	nice news
 blackburn	have you tried to compile shogun there?
@sonney2k	so I already realized that pkg-config on cygwin is broken
@sonney2k	e.g. it returns nothing for hdf5
@sonney2k	but our hdf5 tests (and many other) work
@sonney2k	no idea why though
 blackburn	bad bad
