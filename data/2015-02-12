 nik_	Hi. I would like to ask how could I obtain binary class labels from an CMKLClassification object after training. mkl.apply().get_labels() returns a list of decimal numbers. Are these numbers the class probabilities? Thank you.

@SWAGGRegation	qachen, no idea...
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, you compiled it...  ;)
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, noone know which libs are installed on your system, but you ^^
 GaussKern	qachen: huh? does maybe one of the hdf5 libs require the other one?
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, yolo?
 qachen	yeah, I want to do some hacking on shogun XD
@SWAGGRegation	GaussKern, possibly as we have noone here, who is deep enough into Arch Linux, we'll never know ;)

@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, currently setting up a hackintosh in a vm
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, I can trace that down in there!
@what_switch	hah
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, yolo?
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, could ya fix da bro-grammerproblem?
 yesnofreelunch	what_switch, SWAGGRegation - I finally announced shogun on g+ and some newsgroups
 yesnofreelunch	4.0.0 I mean
* yesnofreelunch slow
@SWAGGRegation	yesnofreelunch, **yay**!!!  :D
@what_switch	slowpoke!
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, let's see if I can reproduce on Hackintosh Yosemite 10.10.1...  ;)

@what_switch	what_switch: oh wel I can try
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, that would be a deal, so we can see if it is apple's clang, thanks breaks everything...
@what_switch	SWAGGRegation: my python is compiled with clang though
 qachen	I use a brute force script, combing find, ldd and grep command. Trying to find who is using old version of libhdf5.so in /usr/lib, but found nothing.
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, mhh... that might be the problem as well...  let's wait for the outcome

@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, I'll create diffs from swig-output with different flags...  let's see what the flags are impacting on output...
 qachen	I couldn't found which part of code is compiling python _modshogun.so, any ideas?
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, cmake/CommonModularInterface.cmake  ;)
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, file and diffs are here:  https://besser82.fedorapeople.org/modshogunPYTHON_wrap/
@what_switch	SWAGGRegation: massive
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, and there real fat thing about them is:  you can compress those ~110 MB down to ~ 3 MB  \o/
 qachen	ohh... that's cmake problems, it always use swig3 in ARCH...
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, can you please try to build from my bugfix-branch and confirm the solution here works?
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, you are working with a fork on github or direct checkout from shogun-repo?
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, *personal fork
 qachen	which I
 qachen	you mean I download the branch and compile it on my os?
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, yes, i can give you instructions, but i need to if you checkout from shogun-toolbox directly or forked before checkout...
 qachen	Oh, I would be very happy if swig3 can works
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, git fetch origin
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, git checkout bugfix/python_modular_swig3
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, did that work?
 qachen	wait a moment
 qachen	Network in china is very slow, you know, GFW...
 qachen	http://fpaste.org/184589/23734036/
 qachen	Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): numpy in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 qachen	Did you edit something about numpy ?
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, nope
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, which branch did you checkout?
 qachen	bugfix/python_modular_swig3
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, that is the correct one
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, but there were no changes to numpy or sth.
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, just some changes how swig is handled internally
 qachen	SWAGGRegation, I'm trying to figure out what's happing, I will give you some response latter.
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, allrighty

 Nick_____	Thanks. I have a  MultiKernel Binary Classification problem and I am not sure how to obtain the classes after classification. If i use the apply() function and then get_labels() that returns a vector with decimal numbers.
 Nick_____	But I would like to get the classes.
 Nick_____	As -1 and 1
@SWAGGRegation	Nick_____, which language?

 Nick_____	 output_vector = output.get_labels()
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, and highly recommended for use
@SWAGGRegation	Nick_____, please use http://fpaste.org
 Nick_____	where mkl = MKLClassification()
 Nick_____	ok sorry!
@SWAGGRegation	Nick_____, np, thx! :D
@SWAGGRegation	qachen, either atlas or eigen3, both are highly recommended

 Nick_____	I want to get the class labels not the support vectors.
 yesnofreelunch	Nick_____: mkl.apply()
 Nick_____	I think mkl.apply().get_labels() is the correct way.
 yesnofreelunch	Nick_____: or get_values() if you want the real valued output
 Nick_____	I do get some real values already. Usually to convert this you say if value > 0.5 then it's class 1 for example, and -1 otherwiser.
 Nick_____	In my case all would be of the same class if I do this conversion
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, so segfault is caused by missing symbol?!?
@what_switch	SWAGGRegation: no
@what_switch	it is because gcc + clang
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, ?
@what_switch	SWAGGRegation: python stuff is clang
@what_switch	shogun is gcc-4.9
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, ahh...  i see...  strange...
 Nick_____	Well anyway thanks for your help. If I don't figure it out I might just use the AUC values that I can get already.
@SWAGGRegation	what_switch, that shouldn't happen anyways...
@SWAGGRegation	Nick_____, yw ^^
 Nick_____	For class= mkl.m_parameters() I get a syntax error. Maybe it's because I am using an older version of Shogun.

@what_switch	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	what_switch: say, could you post an entrance issue on github that is about making Shogun things like here:
@HeikoS	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C++_Idioms/Non-Virtual_Interface
@HeikoS	I think thats a good thing to follow
@HeikoS	maybe there are some simple cases where entrance students can do it?
@what_switch	good
@what_switch	sure
@what_switch	HeikoS: and implement 'maybe'
@what_switch	we should have and use maybe
@what_switch	Maybe

@HeikoS	SWAGGRegation: around?
@HeikoS	what_switch: still there?
@HeikoS	how do we activate linalg on travis?
@HeikoS	with the native backend?
@SWAGGRegation	HeikoS, no, just a bot answering your questions...  :P
@HeikoS	which does not require any libs?
@HeikoS	or egien3 backend?
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	good
@HeikoS	so dear bot, SWAGGRegation, any ideas?
@HeikoS	computable?
@SWAGGRegation	HeikoS, which is "native" backend of linialg?  :P
@HeikoS	SWAGGRegation: the one where we implement things by hand
@HeikoS	or eigen3
@HeikoS	doesnt matter
@HeikoS	but native would be best
@HeikoS	See here for the problem
@HeikoS	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/50301475
@HeikoS	/home/travis/build/shogun-toolbox/shogun/src/shogun/kernel/LinearARDKernel.cpp:86:4: error: 'linalg' has not been declared
@what_switch	HeikoS: hmm I don't know
@HeikoS	what_switch: maybe Wu just forgot to add the include
@HeikoS	Lets see
@SWAGGRegation	HeikoS, probably since Eigen3 was present in Travis...
@HeikoS	yeah I think thats it
@HeikoS	tell Bj?rn thanks, bot
@SWAGGRegation	HeikoS, will do so  ^_^
