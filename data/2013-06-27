 sonne|work	foulwall: hey there sec
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yes all good
@iglesiasg	program updated http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013_program
@wiking	doh :)
@wiking	sonne|work: i did not get a slot!
 foulwall	hey sonne|work, I rewrote a lot of code, I almost finished the js refractor, and have made a new toy data generator, and changed a bit of demo style... so I spent a bit more time on debugging...
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.3] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	wiking: maybe we can squeeze a couple of slots and get one more with half an hour
@wiking	i'd be great
@iglesiasg	I think half an hour for my talk could be ok too

@iglesiasg	hey hushell
@iglesiasg	how are you?
 hushell	hey iglesiasg
 hushell	I am good
 hushell	How are you
 hushell	Do you have any idea: ImportError: cannot import name SerializableJsonFile
@iglesiasg	I am fine too
@iglesiasg	I don't know why it happens
 hushell	Failed at that example: error in serialization_complex_example.py
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn mentioned that sonne|work had modified something about json
@iglesiasg	maybe it is something related to that
 hushell	C interfaces are okay
@iglesiasg	hushell: it is not your PR's fault I think
 hushell	okay. I always leave python check for Travis :)
 hushell	C# modular got problem too...
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	hushell: what is gram matrix? I have quite limited knowledge regarding kernels :)
@iglesiasg	hushell: is it the same askernel matrix?
@iglesiasg	hi lisitsyn, so what do you think about making our presentations in the workshop shorter and squeezing one more for wiking in the schedule?
@iglesiasg	right now we have 2 of 45 min, let's make 3 of 30min?
-!- lambday [67157c4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.124.76] has joined #shogun
 hushell	iglesiasg: just the kernel matrix :)
 lambday	sonne|work: morning :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: some people use that name, so I learned from them
@iglesiasg	hushell: good to know!
 sonne|work	wiking: what do you want to talk about?
 hushell	iglesiasg: Are you going to present something in the workshop?
 sonne|work	lambday: moin moin!
 lambday	:)
@iglesiasg	hushell: yeah! I will talk about structured learning in Shogun
 sonne|work	foulwall: I am not too happy about doing the toy data generation in the .js
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.3] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hmm I don't mind
 sonne|work	foulwall: I know it is a lot faster to run on the client but we have some datagenerator class that we might extend to have the data generation in one place
 hushell	sonne|work: Are you going to record the talks?
@iglesiasg	hushell: let me know if you have any suggestion ;)
@iglesiasg	that would be very nice indeed, to record them
 hushell	Yeah, I'd like to watch you guys online :)
 sonne|work	foulwall: and then can use it also for examples
 sonne|work	hushell: I wish we had but we don't have equipment
 hushell	sonne|work: any webcam works :)
 hushell	maybe we can have some unofficial videos
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: what equipment do we need?
 sonne|work	some camera to do video recording of the whole workshop
 sonne|work	as in talks /
 sonne|work	discussions
 sonne|work	foulwall: do you understand why it is better to have the data generators in python not .js ?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: wiking also wants to give a talk
 foulwall	sonne|work: ok, I'll change that back to server, the generator is now modular, so it's easy to do that
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: luckily only us want to talk :D
 sonne|work	foulwall: very good!
 foulwall	sonne|work: why we need do that in python
 sonne|work	foulwall: for now we do it in python but later we do the data generation via shogun's DataGenerator class
 sonne|work	foulwall: the reason is that we can have stand-a-lone examples to run on the same data
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: well I will be there with some camera for sure but it won't last that long I guess
 foulwall	sonne|work: gotcha
@iglesiasg	hushell: so what do you think about the features issue?
@iglesiasg	hushell: apart from that, from my part the pull request is ready
 hushell	iglesiasg: I think we have had a m_models in machine, so now we can access m_features by m_models
@iglesiasg	hushell: yes
 hushell	but you are right, we finally will move m_features to LinearStructMachine
@iglesiasg	exactly
 hushell	Do you think we need keep m_features in LinearSOMachine right now?
@iglesiasg	well not really need
 hushell	Because currently it will not be used anywhere
@iglesiasg	but my point is, why to remove it now if we know we are going to get it back?
 hushell	okay
@iglesiasg	ok, I understand that too
 hushell	I saw it was in LinearSOMachine but didn't registered
@iglesiasg	so it is up to you, remove it if you prefer that for the moment :) I am fine with that too
@iglesiasg	hushell: I probably forgot to do register it :(
 hushell	In shogun, for a NULL pointer, do we need to register it?
 hushell	I mean always NULL

@iglesiasg	hushell: when you register a variable, you register the variable, not its value
 hushell	iglesiasg: That's ok. We have so many things here :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: okay. I was thinking this registration is kind of memory management
@iglesiasg	hushell: I am not actually aware of everything the registration entails
@iglesiasg	I know part of it is related to model selection and cross validation
@iglesiasg	but most of the init methods (or register parameters) happen before the variables have even been given a value
 hushell	iglesiasg: maybe not keep this pointer in LinearSOMachine right now, we will refine this after the GSOC or in the end :)
@iglesiasg	hushell: all right, as you prefer
 hushell	iglesiasg: Travis failed again :(
 hushell	iglesiasg: Good to know more about Shogun!
 hushell	iglesiasg: I am going to sleep now, let me know if there are other problems about the PR
@iglesiasg	hushell: in python modular it is the SerializableJsonFile
 hushell	yes
@iglesiasg	and in C# I have no idea
@iglesiasg	python modular is not your PR's fault
 hushell	so every merge need to make sure no errors in Travis?
@iglesiasg	hushell: ideally yes
@iglesiasg	but your PR is ready now
@iglesiasg	I am going to merge it soon
@iglesiasg	I just want to know if the C# fail is due to your PR or not
 hushell	maybe wait other PR merges
 hushell	one thing about git
@iglesiasg	yes?
 hushell	once I fetch from upstream, I just need to run git rebase upstream/develop, right?
@iglesiasg	yes
 hushell	okay, then I think I did right thing
@iglesiasg	that is preferable to doing pull as we avoid a commit
@iglesiasg	hushell: so after this PR you are ready to be coding the new stuff right?
 hushell	as you suggested, I use --amend
 hushell	iglesiasg: Actually I am coding new stuffs
@iglesiasg	the factor graph I think it was the first thing to do
 hushell	they are in parallel
@iglesiasg	awesome!
 hushell	but I want to know more about the SSVM in Shogun, so I choose to do this first
@iglesiasg	I understand
 hushell	yes, factor graph should be new stuff to Shogun
@iglesiasg	I am afraid tha the C# fail might actually be due to your PR
 hushell	The OpenGM guys got a CVPR paper about their graphical model lib, I asked them about the factor graph implementation
 hushell	let me check
 hushell	Is it because I didn't update the Swig for C#?
@iglesiasg	I have no idea
 hushell	everything about C# in src/interfaces/csharp_modular?
@iglesiasg	I think that is mostly autogenerated
@iglesiasg	the actual SWIG code is in src/interfaces/modular
@iglesiasg	but you did not create any new class so there should be no need to update SWIG
 hushell	that's a bit strange
@iglesiasg	the only thing I come up with is that maybe any of the new includes has interfered
 hushell	let me test C# tomorrow locally then we think about the merge again
@iglesiasg	hushell: why did you change the position of the includes here btw?
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1185/files#L29R17
@iglesiasg	hushell: ok, have a rest now :)
 hushell	the define __H__ should be before include files, isn't it?
 hushell	otherwise the macro trick would not make sense
@iglesiasg	I don't know, how is it done in the other files? :)
@iglesiasg	it makes sense what you are saying though
@iglesiasg	yeah ok that should be right
 hushell	#ifndef _STRUCTURED_MODEL__H__                                                                                         ||
 hushell	#define _STRUCTURED_MODEL__H__                                                                                         ||-   struct
 hushell	                                                                                                                       |||     TMultipleCPinfo [shogun
 hushell	#include <shogun/base/SGObject.h>                                                                                      |||     CResultSet [shogun]
 hushell	#include <shogun/features/Features.h>                                                                                  ||
 hushell	#include <shogun/labels/StructuredLabels.h>
 hushell	sorry, I copy from vi directly
 hushell	this is an example from StructuredModel
@iglesiasg	ok
 hushell	okay, I'll test the csharp thing tomorrow and see what's wrong over there
@iglesiasg	sounds good
 hushell	I only test cmd and python_modular currently on my computer
@iglesiasg	yeah, me too
@iglesiasg	I check with travis and the buildbot the others hehe
 hushell	this is the best part of travis :D
 hushell	okay see you later
@iglesiasg	bye, and very nice job!
@iglesiasg	I like how the StructuredModel is getting
@iglesiasg	rather clean
 hushell	very limited contribution indeed :( but I am happy to join you guys! Have a nice day

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	lambday:  hi!
@HeikoS	saw your mail, sounds reasonable
 lambday	HeikoS: yes, I guess makes things more easy
@HeikoS	yep totally
 lambday	we can use lanczos later then
 lambday	alright
 lambday	sending the PR
@HeikoS	cool!
 lisitsyn	I heard someone is solving eigenproblems here
 lambday	lisitsyn: we we! :D
@HeikoS	lambday: always ask the master on those :)
@HeikoS	aka lisitsyn :)
 lisitsyn	I don't know anything but I worked on that a bit
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am thinking how can we re-use the things I have in tapkee
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we will need to solve gigantic eigenvalue problems at some point
@HeikoS	but only largest/smallest
@HeikoS	sparse matrices
@HeikoS	with horrible horrible condition numbers
@HeikoS	so we need something stable (priority over speed)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not arpack then
 lisitsyn	;D
 lisitsyn	but you still need something with reverse interface
 lisitsyn	or specialized on sparse
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~polizzi/feast/ this one could be more numericall stable
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am thinking if I can extract eigen things from tapkee to separate lib..
 lisitsyn	then we can work together on that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok would be good
@HeikoS	I can provide a matrix to test it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean I already did some things so this should not be lost
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday its very important that all the eigensolvers are based on linear operators that are applied to vectors rather than storing matrices btw
 lisitsyn	but using dimension reduction library from some other code is wrong
 lambday	HeikoS: yes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well that's arpack and feast
 lisitsyn	I am not sure I know other solvers with reverse interface
 lisitsyn	http://www.comp-phys.org/software/ietl/
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: MKL uses FEAST btw
 lisitsyn	starting from this year february
@HeikoS	no idea about these things :)
@HeikoS	matlab fails on the matrices I have here btw
@HeikoS	I want things up to machine precision >:-|
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but you know what MKL is, right?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  not really, some sparsity stuff right? :D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no, huge intel librar
 lisitsyn	that does everything
@HeikoS	ah this one
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	no I don tknow that
 lambday	I should checkout FEAST then.. :-/
 lambday	lisitsyn: what do you use in tapkee?
 lambday	HeikoS: I sent the PR, please have a look
 lisitsyn	lambday: arpack, randomized and dense method from eigen3
 lambday	okay
 lisitsyn	randomized is out :D
 lisitsyn	dense is too
 lambday	yeah :(
 lambday	we want sparse :(
 lambday	FEAST has support for that?
 lisitsyn	lambday: arpack supports sparse
 lisitsyn	feast too
@HeikoS	lambday: why do you add all those debug messages to the constructors? do you have memory leaks often=?
@HeikoS	lambday: you can compile with --enable-trace-mallocs then shogun will print all allocated objects at the end of a program so its easy to track which ones are still in mem
 lambday	umm.. initially I had when I was trying to get SG_REF/UNREF.. now I just copy paste :D
@HeikoS	olk
 lambday	I thought of removing all of them when the whole code is ready
 lambday	:-/
@HeikoS	they dont hurt us just wondering :)
@HeikoS	nono leave them its fine
@HeikoS	just wonderiung
 lambday	alright, I'll try enable-trace-mallocs
@HeikoS	lambday: hey I just read about this indian mathematician that went to england before WW2, do you know about that guy?
 lambday	umm... no! :(
 lambday	I mean
@HeikoS	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan
 lambday	Ramanujan
 lambday	ohh
@HeikoS	awesome guy!
 lambday	yeah !!
 lambday	he's a genius!
 lambday	absolute genius! I heard stories that when he was on his deathbed, someone came by a car to meet him... he looked up the window.. when that guy entered, he told him that your car plate number is a multiple of two huge prime numbers
 lambday	and then he told what those prime numbers are
 lambday	lol
 lambday	(not sure how far these stories are true anyway)
@iglesiasg	it is a pity he passed away so young :(
 lambday	yes :(
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: currently reading a book on prime numbers where he had a chapter
 lambday	ahan!
@HeikoS	lambday: I think storing the eigenvalues in the class is a bit strange if you provide a matrix in the compute method
@HeikoS	lambday: either make the class store the matrix (and the eigenvalues) or return them and dont store them
@HeikoS	lambday: you can do this via references
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do we have typemaps for std::pair?
 lambday	yes I thought of that
 lambday	okay then I'll change it
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@HeikoS	and please do some unit tests for the non full rank systems
 lambday	okay
@HeikoS	note that LLT can solve over and underdetermined systems but not those with negative eigenvalues
 lambday	yes..
 lambday	I was thinking of adding a check in the linear solver I added (for eigenvalues), but then thought it will be too slow :-/
@HeikoS	lambday: man if you continue in that pace the project will be done in 2 weeks :)
@HeikoS	lambday: LLT class should do this in fact
@HeikoS	try it with a non-psd matrix
@HeikoS	you can probably ask it whether the matrix is fine
 lambday	HeikoS: haha no don't worry my thesis adviser has threatened me to kick me out (because I haven't been doing any of his work since last 2 weeks), so I'll be a bit slow for sometime :(
@HeikoS	lambday: careful then! uni is more important than GSoC in the long run
@HeikoS	lambday: also you work very fast, so dont worry to slow down a bit
 lambday	HeikoS: LLT class :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: haha yes..
@HeikoS	although I really like that things are going so well!
@HeikoS	lambday: looks like it doesnt catch that
 lambday	HeikoS: you're the mastermind.. I just execute.. I too am really happy with how this is going too :) so, I didn't get much depressed with what thesis adviser told me (I was supposed to be more depressed)
@HeikoS	lambday: then its fine, user sets the solver and if user provides wrong matrix its his problem
 lambday	HeikoS: yes that's what I thought
@HeikoS	the std solver should be able to solve everything though, so probably QR/SVD
 lambday	user shouldn't call LLT for non psd matrices
@HeikoS	lambday: yep LLT should be a conscious decision
@HeikoS	lambday: there is ComputationInfo info() though
@HeikoS	you could check this in any case
 lambday	in Eigen3?
@HeikoS	lambday: its a method of LLT
@HeikoS	LLT::info
 lambday	okay.. yes I'll check it
@HeikoS	only check for Success
@HeikoS	or maybe just print error type in case of no success
 lambday	ah, that would help me print an error msg if user mistakenly calls LLT on a nonpsd matrices
@HeikoS	there are 3 cases
 lambday	yes yes!
@HeikoS	lambday: ok gotta do some work now, will be back later in the day
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. I'll check it
 lambday	see you :)
@HeikoS	lambday: Ill keep an eye on PRs though
@HeikoS	but I have to switch off irc, otherwise I wont work :D
 lambday	okay :)
@HeikoS	so see you
 lambday	hehe

 lisitsyn	pickle27: hey!
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: how is it going?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: good! I finished my code that tests jadiag vs the R version
 pickle27	and they matched!
 pickle27	today I have been working on ffdiag and I think I am getting close to being done
 lisitsyn	pickle27: cool!
 lisitsyn	more time to get some examples done
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah!
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I think I am going to try and get a BSS example going after ffdiag and before porting uwedge
 lisitsyn	pickle27: what example?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: for now I just want it to work on the scikit-learn example data
 pickle27	I haven't got to it yet but it looks like ADJ is just one of the step for BSS so I think theres more to do
 pickle27	and I want to get started looking at that part
 pickle27	lisitsyn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#independent-component-analysis-ica
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I like that mixed signal thing
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I have the example ported to C++ I just need to finish the methods and run them on it
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ohh you don't like easy ways ;)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: oh like running the whole thing in python?
 lisitsyn	yeah would be easier for you
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hah true that would have been easier
 pickle27	lisitsyn: although it'll be easier to debug now that its all c++
 lisitsyn	pickle27: same thing if you are using gdb
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ah btw try cgdb
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah Im not that great with gdb I tend to just use printing and cin.get for debugginh
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh that's mostly gdb that is not nice enough
 lisitsyn	I mean it is rather difficult to see a matrix there
 pickle27	I'll have to check out cgdb
 lisitsyn	pickle27: it is a editor (or text viewer) combined with gdb
 lisitsyn	so you may put breakpoints
@sonney2k	van51, how is it going?
 lisitsyn	using just spacebar
 pickle27	cool yeah I've used gdb a few times
 van51	sonney2k: it's been a slow day today tbh :$
 van51	sonney2k: now I'm converting the densematrix to a sparse representation like you commente
 van51	d
 van51	and after that I'm thinking of starting to see the streaming features
 van51	btw, is there a specific way I should expect a document collection to be represented?

 pickle27	lisitsyn:
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yes
 pickle27	lisitsyn: does memory from memcpy need to be free'd manually?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: what memory?
 lisitsyn	destination?
 pickle27	I've got a seg fault that throws after my code runs and this memcpy I've got is the only thing I suspect
 pickle27	its from one SGNDArray to another
 van51	does a SGSparseMatrix expect its SGSparseVectors to have the same size?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hmm still not clear
 van51	because I see it can take a num_feat as a parameter, but it's not documented on its meaning
 pickle27	this is the code I have:
 van51	does it mean the size of the vectors or the size of the dimension they represent?
 pickle27	SGNDArray<float64_t> C(C0.dims,3);
 pickle27	memcpy(C.array, C0.array, C0.dims[0]*C0.dims[1]*C0.dims[2]*sizeof(float64_t));
 pickle27	lisitsyn: ^
 pickle27	C0 is passed by ref to the function
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I expect C0.dims may be deleted before C
 lisitsyn	memcpy part looks ok
 pickle27	ahh so I should do a deep copy of that too
 pickle27	okay I'll try that

 pickle27	lisitsyn: that fixed it thanks
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I don't know if I would have caught that
 lisitsyn	pickle27: two years of catching such errors ;)
 lisitsyn	slowed down though
@wiking	lisitsyn: yo
@wiking	brb
@wiking	here
@wiking	lisitsyn: can i borrow 15 minutes of your time?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes sure
@wiking	lisitsyn: thnx heaps
 lisitsyn	what's up?
@wiking	i mean your workshop presentation time ;)
 lisitsyn	wiking: ahha :D
 lisitsyn	yes sure
 lisitsyn	wiking: what do you want to present?
@wiking	well mostly the yet to be commited shit i was working between sept-dec
@wiking	give a little demo
@wiking	what i was doing with it
 lisitsyn	wiking: DVOR images please
@wiking	DVOR?
 lisitsyn	I can't forget that category
@wiking	ahhahahah
 lisitsyn	remember that?
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	i doo
@wiking	it's watermarked in my eyes
@wiking	vividly
@sonney2k	wiking, so what did you want to talk about?
 lisitsyn	haha yes same too
 lisitsyn	I just wake up and see that
@wiking	sonney2k: so if possible would like to give a little demo of the stuff i was doing with shogun
@sonney2k	van51, I would rather want you to finish up the stuff and get it merged ASAP
@iglesiasg	wiking: latent stuff?
@wiking	iglesiasg: yep
@iglesiasg	wiking: yeah, do a latent presentation!
@sonney2k	van51, I was expecting that this takes you 2 days no more...
@iglesiasg	that sounds mighty
 lisitsyn	wiking: iglesiasg: latent like with some gay allusions ;)
@wiking	iglesiasg: yeah .. but unfortunately i cannot pythonize it :(
@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: what is it in?
@wiking	lisitsyn: parts detection in image
 lisitsyn	wiking: I mean written in
 lisitsyn	you said you cannot pythonize
@wiking	ah yeah
@wiking	remember the discussion back in october
@wiking	about what can be and what cannot be directorized? :)
@wiking	by swig
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	wiking: so C++?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	i could create wrapper classes for it
@wiking	but i doubt that anybody would ever use it again in the same way
@sonney2k	van51, it would be cool to move on
@sonney2k	wiking, sure but need to schedule it lisitsyn, iglesiasg any thoughts?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am ok to give my 15 minutes
@wiking	sonney2k: only thing is that maybe presenting after iglesiasg would make the most sense, if iglesiasg don't mind, as i'll be referring to SOSVM...

@wiking	btw anybody realised that u can edit code on github page directly? :)
@wiking	i mean actually edit HEAD and do commit there straight away
@sonney2k	wiking, ok so then sergey should be last
@sonney2k	and you inbetween
@wiking	k
@sonney2k	wiking, do you have a real demo?
@sonney2k	or slides?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I use it
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i'm using it
 lisitsyn	sometimes
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean i have a real application
@wiking	sonney2k: that is actually being used
@sonney2k	wiking, that you can show?
@sonney2k	ok
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: hopefully not these images I have seen once
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, would it be OK if you do just 30 minutes SO, followed by wiking with an SO application?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	wiking, what is the title of the talk then?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok then please adjust the schedule on the website
@iglesiasg	wiking: give me a title please :)
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
@wiking	iglesiasg: (latent)SOSVM in practice
 van51	sonney2k: yeah I know.. I have to pick up some speed
@sonney2k	van51, otherwise we cannot do the fun part
@sonney2k	it would be stupid to get stuck in the easiest thing already
@sonney2k	so van51 go go go!
@sonney2k	alrighty
* sonney2k dead
@sonney2k	cu
@sonney2k	van51, btw regarding sparse vectors just alloc number of ngrams/words many elements
@sonney2k	and fill them
 van51	sonney2k: that would leave some spaced unused, wouldn't it?
@iglesiasg	Spain to the final guys, we are there!
@iglesiasg	well not me ... whatever
