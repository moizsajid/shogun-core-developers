 sonne|osx	foulwall: hey
 sonne|osx	foulwall: please don't always hide from us - be in IRC :)
 foulwall	sonne|osx, my irc client did not do auto reconnect:(
 sonne|osx	foulwall: well use one that does :)
 sonne|osx	foulwall: anyway
 sonne|osx	foulwall: do you remember the multi class demo from the beginning?
 sonne|osx	foulwall: we just realized that this is still using the old code david did. Please convert it to your framework and get rid of davids old code
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: moin moin!
 foulwall	sonne|osx, ok, I'll rewrite them this afternoon, but I'll finish the mldata downloading first. I'll send a pull request on mldata downloader this afternoon.
 gsomix__	sonne|osx, hey.
 sonne|osx	foulwall: ok thanks!
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: now that the ascii stuff works what would you want to do next?
 gsomix__	sonne|osx, protobuf
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: ok so how much do you know already about it?
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: maybe I just explain quickly
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: you need to define a .proto file
 sonne|osx	that is similar to a struct in C
 gsomix__	sonne|osx, will be fine. please, explain.
 sonne|osx	where you define what is to be saved
 sonne|osx	then this file can be compiled into C code
 sonne|osx	and for saving you will then fill the structs provided in this C code
 sonne|osx	and then there is some function that gives you a byte array
 sonne|osx	that you can then dump to disc
 sonne|osx	as you can see the problem is that you need basically everything extra in memory
 sonne|osx	so it is not meant to store e.g. a full SGMatrix at once
 sonne|osx	but rather chunks of the matrix
 sonne|osx	anyway
 sonne|osx	lets start with a simple protobuf file for a vector
 sonne|osx	you have 2 fields (for now)
 sonne|osx	{ int64 length = 1; repeated double vector = 2; }
 sonne|osx	the 1 and 2 here are identifiers
 sonne|osx	you then get the protobuf tools
 sonne|osx	and compile that file with protoc
 sonne|osx	and then just try for once to fill in the data
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: after that is done you are basically ready and we will define protobuf files for all of what CFile supports (yes for all datatypes like int etc).
 gsomix__	sonney2k, ok, got it.
 gsomix__	sonne|osx,
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: later we can make things more efficient
 sonne|osx	by saving multiple chunks
 sonne|osx	i.e. instead of saving the whole vector
 sonne|osx	you save say only a 1MB chunk of the vector
 sonne|osx	and then append another etc
 sonne|osx	for that to work you need a header
 sonne|osx	that says how big the chunk is
 sonne|osx	and another header saying how big the vector really is
 sonne|osx	and well it makes sense to have another header saying which format version this is
 sonne|osx	so we can change things later if we want
 sonne|osx	gsomix__: ok?
 gsomix__	sonne|osx, ok. need little time for comprehension :)
 gsomix__	simple protobuf file for vector vector first
 sonne|osx	well ask whe you have Qs
 sonne|osx	oki gtg be back soon

@HeikoS	sonne|work: around?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: y
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so if we do a connection flight
@HeikoS	its as cheap as 534 return p.P.
@HeikoS	over minneapolis
@HeikoS	but takes quite a bit longer
@HeikoS	oh
@HeikoS	just found another cheap one
@HeikoS	direct
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's the route for you?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: london -> SFO
 lisitsyn	ah directly
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so there is one for 544 pounds directly london sfo
 lisitsyn	I will have KUF -> SVO -> JFK -> SFO
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	LHR->SFO 1035->1335        SFO->LHR 13:00->7:10       for 544 each
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: oh man
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but that's just 1000$
 lisitsyn	both back and forth
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: stressfull :)
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	thats good
 lisitsyn	yeah really cheap
 lisitsyn	I guess moscow -> sfo is way too long way
 sonne|work	HeikoS: don't get it ... what is the total? FLight I looked up where about 700-800 back and forth :)
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so if you would be in london LHR by 9 everythign is fine
@HeikoS	sonne|work: 544 return each
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you want to share a flight?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: return means LHR->SFO & SFO->LHR?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes, that are 636 euros
@HeikoS	expedia
@HeikoS	sonne|work: a flight to london should be cheap, less than 100
 sonne|work	ok so I would maybe pay 300 or so to get to LHR and back
@HeikoS	sonne|work: no thats much less
@HeikoS	I fly to Germany often, its usually under 100 euros for two people
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: lucky you
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so go together or seperate?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: also fine with seperate that might be cheaper
 lisitsyn	I go to us embassy *by train* and it is more than 100euros for me alone
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: oh man sweet
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not really :) that's too much
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: comparing to your london - germany trips for 100 euros
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: for two :D
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: unhealthy prices
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but keep in mind its very close
@HeikoS	by car would be just 5 hours
 sonne|work	HeikoS: well book this flight, give me the details and I try to get the same one!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm true
 sonne|work	HeikoS: it is friday to friday right?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I will send you the dates
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I cannot go earlier (no more holidays)
@HeikoS	sonne|work: not sure what you mean, shall I book for me only?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: ???
 sonne|work	HeikoS: you book for you
 sonne|work	from fr -> fr
 sonne|work	and then I book the same flight when I have the details
@HeikoS	I see,
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: when will you arrive?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I hope there will still be seats so you could join aswell
@HeikoS	sonne|work: arriving on sat is also fine right? (flight is at 1300)
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	Friday evening is the first pool party & reception
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: oh moscow -> london is not cheap
@HeikoS	sonne|work: return sorry
 sonne|work	HeikoS: these are the events you get to know most people
@HeikoS	sonne|work: was a typo I meant return
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I think when we leave friday evening we will be back on saturday evening
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	sonne|work: lisitsyn Ill send you a meail with the flight dates soon to double check, and if you give OK I will book
 sonne|work	you know kids... 1 week is already very long
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think I'll go separate - I checked moscow -> london and it is already way too expensive
 sonne|work	HeikoS: please in messenger I dont' read mail at work
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: moscow -> new york is better for me
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: how much is it to go to SFO for you?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: 1000$
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: ok about the same
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: that's samara->moscow->new york->san francisco

-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 sonne|work	HeikoS: email me the details and I will hopefully book tonight
@HeikoS	sent to you and lisitsyn
 sonne|work	HeikoS: kthx
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: thanks
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: sonne|work: I am having troubles with finding a flight that arrives before you
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: if you arrive one day earlier you can stay at my place
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what place?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: when would you arrive?
@HeikoS	I live in London remember?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ahh you mean london
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: most of the flights arrive to SFO evening
 lisitsyn	let me check london
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: wait wait
 lisitsyn	how can I stay in london
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: come on they won't let me in haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah those bastards :)
@HeikoS	I once slept a night at heatthrow airport
@HeikoS	that was pretty unconfortable :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: exact time?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: either 19 or 21
 sonne|work	that is too late
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: there is a flight by delta that arrives 12:28
 sonne|work	take that one
 lisitsyn	but it is +300$
 sonne|work	you would miss the reception
 lisitsyn	ohh
 lisitsyn	really?
 sonne|work	or go a day earlier
 lisitsyn	that's bad
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yeah there is a pool party on friday evening
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: oh this one is supposed to have 19hrs waiting in JFK
 sonne|work	haha so stranded in JFK - worse than LHR :D
@HeikoS	hehe
 lisitsyn	well I can go out
 lisitsyn	I guess
 lisitsyn	but yes that's too much
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I can arrive to heathrow by 08:00
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that sounds good
@HeikoS	heathrow is not too bad in fact
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: how much your flight cost?
@HeikoS	544 return from london
 lisitsyn	544 pounds?
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn	argh that would be quite a lot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  you should totally move to europe ;)
 lisitsyn	300 + 300 + 844
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that's $ cost
@HeikoS	although travelling home is tough than
@HeikoS	wow
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: whats the alternative?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: arrive evening by aeroflot from moscow through new york
 lisitsyn	arriving at 19:38
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what about going one day earlier?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes possible
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: so then you rent the car and pick us up at the airport :D
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: no driver license
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: or you just take a cab
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: are u sure 19:39 is already too late?
 lisitsyn	I mean I arrived to the hotel in berlin like ~23 and it was ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the problem is the party aleady is over then
@HeikoS	you need some time from the airport etc
@HeikoS	maybe rest
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ~1hr I guess
 lisitsyn	no?
 lisitsyn	hmm no
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	as you like
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would be sad if you missed that
@HeikoS	its the reason why you go there
@HeikoS	so better go one day ealier
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah makes sense
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I can arrive late night of 17th
 lisitsyn	and just walk down to the hotel :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yep, have a nice sleep and then we already arrive
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you think I can check in night of 18th?
 lisitsyn	Check-In TimeAnytime after 3:00 pm. Valid ID and credit card required.
 lisitsyn	argh
@HeikoS	?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I can't check in night between 17th and 18th
@HeikoS	why?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: Check-In TimeAnytime after 3:00 pm. Valid ID and credit card required.
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: ha there are rooms in wild palms still

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: all the flights that fit the time have some crazy waiting times so far
@HeikoS	ah shit
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: searching :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay catch it
 lisitsyn	oh wonderful wonderful
 lisitsyn	KUF -> FRA -> SFO
 lisitsyn	12:20
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: and just one transfer
@HeikoS	that sounds good
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	how much?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: 1300$
@HeikoS	thats fine
@HeikoS	isnt it?
@HeikoS	how much do we get again?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no idea :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am ok to cover it anyway
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: should work out fine though
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have no idea how does it work
 lisitsyn	and not sure it is easy to transfer money to ?ussia :)
 lisitsyn	so in the worst case I pay by myself but I am ok
 lisitsyn	lunch time
@HeikoS	enjoy :D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok then I'll buy it once I get visa
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I have a problem with swig can you help me?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: for sure
@HeikoS	basically first question: how to do templates?
@HeikoS	I mean RealBlabla
@HeikoS	I did this
@HeikoS	#ifdef USE_FLOAT64
@HeikoS	    %template(RealOperatorFunction) COperatorFunction<float64_t>;
@HeikoS	#endif
@HeikoS	but I get
@HeikoS	Mathematics.i:25: Error: Template 'COperatorFunction' undefined.
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think some include is missed
@HeikoS	%include <shogun/mathematics/logdet/OperatorFunction.h>
@HeikoS	#ifdef USE_FLOAT64
@HeikoS	    %template(RealOperatorFunction) COperatorFunction<float64_t>;
@HeikoS	#endif
@HeikoS	same error
@HeikoS	do I need to include something else than the class?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: Mathematics_includes.i too IIRC
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	ehm
@HeikoS	well its in there
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oohh I think you have to push lambday a bit to structurize things in logdet
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: really?
 lisitsyn	I think there should be logdet/solver
 lisitsyn	logdet/operator
@HeikoS	so is it possible to have a non-templated child class inheriting from a templated one?
 lisitsyn	may be like that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok will do
@HeikoS	yeah the solvers should be in math itself

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you think that's the problem?
@HeikoS	operator too
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no idea really
@HeikoS	I dont do this swig stuff often
@HeikoS	so a problem
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay let me check it
@HeikoS	COperatorFunction<float64_t>   ->  CRationalApproximation   -> CLogRationalApproximationCGM
@HeikoS	this is an inheritence thing going on
 lisitsyn	that looks okay
 lisitsyn	in features we have the same thing
@HeikoS	the CRationalApproximation fixes the template upon inheritance
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ahh didn't you forget
 lisitsyn	namespace?
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	where to put it?
@HeikoS	testing
@HeikoS	yep that did it :)

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, ok
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: can you currently compile shogun?
@HeikoS	I got this weird error compi?ling a unit test
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, latest develop?
@HeikoS	yep
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, let me try
@HeikoS	ProbingSampler unit test
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, mm I didn't get any error here
@iglesiasg	let me see if I can run that test
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: do you have eigen installed or bundled by cmake?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, funny thing is that ./shogun-unit-test --gtest_filter=Probing*
@iglesiasg	doesn't run any test

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 lambday	what problems did we face for swig typemaps?
@HeikoS	lambday: some minor things, see my PR
@HeikoS	lambday: I am just to code up a small python example
@HeikoS	I wrote interface files
@HeikoS	want to test it :)
 lambday	HeikoS: awesome! :D
@HeikoS	lambday: yep lets see :)
@HeikoS	interfaces are tricky
@HeikoS	lambday: we definitely need to provide some std cases so that people dont have to instanciate all these classes
@HeikoS	ok I will try it out now
 lambday	HeikoS: so, for the abstract base classes, if we tell the compiler to create with specific types in the header, it creates problem?
@HeikoS	lambday: btw the unit test for the probing sampler doesnt work
@HeikoS	lambday: no we need a convienience constructor which we just give a matrix which sets up default configurations
 lambday	HeikoS: doesn't work? :-/
@HeikoS	without any classes
@HeikoS	lambday: compile error
@HeikoS	ProbingSampler test
 lambday	errr...
@HeikoS	some eigen static compile error
@HeikoS	not detected by travis
@HeikoS	since no colpack on there
 lambday	uh?
@HeikoS	its the eigen version that comes with cmake bundle
@HeikoS	and my local one too
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could reproduce it
 lambday	but the guarded the whole test with #ifdef #endif
 lambday	for colpack :-/
 lambday	not sure HeikoS last night I tested on the machine that sonne|osx gave access to, and it worked.. I'll check into it
 lambday	HeikoS: could you please try installing colpack and see what it says? :(
@HeikoS	lambday: I have colpaclk installed
@HeikoS	its not a colpack problem
@HeikoS	the guards work fine
@HeikoS	its an eigen problem
 lambday	errr....
 lambday	clueless
@HeikoS	lambday: let me finish this and then tell you more details
@HeikoS	lambday: dont worry :)
 lambday	HeikoS: alright :)
 lambday	so, I should add new tests as libshogun tests in undocumented, right? or as unit-tests....(I wanna add tests for the ozone data)'

@HeikoS	lambday: is there a method to compute the number?
@HeikoS	I remember the eliptic curve functions

@HeikoS	should be possible to automate this (optional)
@HeikoS	or in fact default should be automatic and user provides accuracy
@HeikoS	lambday: some other things: could you structure the logdet classes a bit
 lambday	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/mathematics/logdet/RationalApproximation_unittest.cc#L143
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact, most things can go into own folders
@HeikoS	lambday: such as operators/ solvers/ etc
 lambday	HeikoS: yes they should..
@HeikoS	subfolders in mathematics
 lambday	HeikoS: alright, I will do that...
 lambday	yes that would be better
@HeikoS	lambday: but wait until I submitted the python example
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	otherwise interfaces will break
@HeikoS	this way we can detect that
@HeikoS	lambday: just realising how much work you did there, all these classes ... :D
 lambday	:D
 lambday	but I am a bit concerned about the performance
 lambday	in many places I could have used const type& but I used pass-by-val
@HeikoS	lambday: for what type of arguments?
 lambday	and I am most concerned about the performance of cg solvers..
@HeikoS	well see
 lambday	SGVector<T> mostly
@HeikoS	lambday: nice that you have all these checks
@HeikoS	no segfaults if something is NULL
 lambday	those are the ones I am worried about
@HeikoS	lambday: should be fast
@HeikoS	but if you can change a few, thats useful
@HeikoS	but later
@HeikoS	first things have to work
 lambday	yes
 lambday	HeikoS: so, I should add the ozone example in example/libshogun/undocumented/., right?
 lambday	oops

 lambday	8th param in DSTEMR?
@HeikoS	thats what it prints
 lambday	that cannot be colpack, that's lapack!
@HeikoS	what? :)
 lambday	and where I used it for, it just takes the length of an SGVector
 lambday	:-/
 lambday	how can that be illegal when I already initialized it with a std::vector<T>::size()
@HeikoS	lambday: why are you using lapack there?
@HeikoS	max eigenvalue?
@HeikoS	why lapack?
 lambday	HeikoS: that's for the triangular eigensolver
 lambday	yes yes
@HeikoS	eigen cannot do that?
 lambday	HeikoS: because eigen3 didn't have anything for that
@HeikoS	what matrix is that again?
 lambday	yes it cannot :(
 lambday	any psd matrix
@HeikoS	how large?
 pickle27	wiking: around?
 lambday	for lanczos, we do CG iterations, and we put two params as main diagonal and subdiagonal as another matrix (lanczos T-matrix) which is a tridiagonal matrix
@HeikoS	lambday: if this is a dense matrix, how does lapack do it? iteratively or ?
 lambday	HeikoS: depends on the number of iteration
@HeikoS	ok
 lambday	HeikoS: no idea! I took that as a blackbox
@HeikoS	i remember
@HeikoS	lambday: since for dense matrices that are not too large, computing all eigenvalues is not that much more expensive that just one
@HeikoS	so could also compute all and take the maximum, but this depends on matrix size
 lambday	yes....
 lambday	but this worked awesome with all the machines I tried it in
 pickle27	wiking: nvm think I found my mistake, was playing with cmake!
 lambday	HeikoS: where does it give error exactly? for modular interface?
 lambday	dstemr is awfully accurate
 lambday	HeikoS: yes I thought of that, but when we can manage with two vectors of size 1000xsizeof(double), why should we use 1000x1000xsizeof(double) matrix, right?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah maybe you are right
@HeikoS	Ill try a bit further
 lambday	1000=number of iteration (and therefore the default dim for Lanczos T-matrix)
@HeikoS	ok
 lambday	HeikoS: if it gives error, we need to test it more
 lambday	:(
 lambday	may be something I missed
 lambday	:(
 lambday	the typemaps looks awesome, although I didn't fully get how it works
 lambday	and yeah, since we don't need internal complex linear operators, we don't need to expose them to modular typemaps
 lambday	just the directlinearsolvercomplex
 lambday	:)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1348 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1348  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Kevin <kevinhughes27@gmail.com>
 lambday	I was watching these video lecture series by Alexander Stepanov, man he is really against virtual methods! :-/
 shogun-buildbot	build #1646 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile csharp_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1646  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@HeikoS	lambday: why?
 lambday	HeikoS: he's convinced that its slow and there is better way to do it (for that I need to watch the whole series)
 lambday	in fact he says that he hasn't seen a really good example where OOP can *really* be a lifesaver
 lambday	:-/
@HeikoS	lambday: and the alternative is?
 lambday	I have no idea :(
 lambday	I gotta watch the whole series and then may be I can say something.. but is it slow?
 lambday	I mean, I am not so sure how does compile treats virtual functions
@HeikoS	lambday: these are issues for the compiler architects :)
@HeikoS	-c:16: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] In file /home/heiko/Desktop/shogun/shogun/src/shogun/mathematics/logdet/LanczosEigenSolver.cpp line 145: Some error occured while computing eigenvalues!
 lambday	but to me, its obviously the cleaner way to do it - specially with the situation like this that we have for log-det
@HeikoS	matrix is identity 10x10
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah dont worry about virtual methods
 lambday	HeikoS: it says it doesn't converged??
@HeikoS	lambday: coding time also counts
@HeikoS	lambday: this is the error I get
@HeikoS	warning rather
@HeikoS	I still get a reasonable result from the log-det sampler
 lambday	HeikoS: that is probably because I set the default convergance cond for all CG based solver to be 1e-6
 lambday	:(
@HeikoS	but thats identity matrix
 lambday	on residual'
 lambday	hmmm
 lambday	ummm
 lambday	doesn't the warning say anything else?
 lambday	wait checking
 lambday	if (info==0)
 lambday	errrr
 lambday	do you have cblas installed?
 lambday	it seems the dstemr you have isn't right... for some reason!

@HeikoS	lambday: sorry computer crash
 lambday	HeikoS: np :)
 lambday	HeikoS: I am worried that the lapack you have does the right thing!
 lambday	because info should NOT be non-zero!
@HeikoS	lambday: we will find loads of those
 lambday	that's helpful actually
@HeikoS	lambday: indeed
 lambday	HeikoS: where do you have liblapack.so?
@HeikoS	there are more problems in fact
 lambday	HeikoS: more? :( like?
@HeikoS	/usr/lib/liblapack.so.3
 lambday	and not /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so??
 lambday	I am not the guy to ask but sergey can may be say something!
 lambday	and if it turns out that it depends on atlas so we should guard it with proper #ifdefs
@HeikoS	lambday: do you have latest source compiled?
@HeikoS	lambday: with python bindings?
 lambday	no
 lambday	wait I am testing
@HeikoS	lambday:
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6381240
@HeikoS	this is a little script that gives wrong results, maybe I have done something wrong in setting the thing up
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe first add the automatic num_shifts
 lambday	HeikoS: so, inside the RationalApproximation class
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	first thing to do is to make a very simply example work
@HeikoS	lambday: and the shifts are crucial for that
 lambday	testing
 lambday	HeikoS: in one unit-test, I did that
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I know, then you can use that code
 lambday	HeikoS: so, I should add a python modular example that does the same thing, right?
 lambday	(btw this is the example, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/mathematics/logdet/RationalApproximation_unittest.cc#L107)
@HeikoS	lambday: nono, lets wait with the examples
@HeikoS	add a method to the corresponding class
@HeikoS	and the user specified num shifts should be optional
 lambday	HeikoS: alright...
@HeikoS	if you make a method that returns needed number of shifts or so
@HeikoS	then user can even check that and the decide what to do
@HeikoS	lambday: next thing is to make my gist work
@HeikoS	it returns the wrong result
@HeikoS	lambday: there should also be a unit test for this case
@HeikoS	that is in the python example
 lambday	HeikoS: I will test...
 lambday	HeikoS: do you think it gives wrong result because of the lapack eigensolver thing?
@HeikoS	lambday:  no thats another problem
@HeikoS	lambday: this happened when I passed a all zeros matrix
@HeikoS	or all ones
@HeikoS	lambday: which is ok not to work, but there should be a check for these cases
 lambday	HeikoS: aaaarghhh! I think the shifts computation method doesn't work then eig_max/eig_min=1
@HeikoS	lambday: so maybe add on your list "unit test for stupid borderline cases" :)
 lambday	heheh yes I will
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, this should be catched and a proper message should be output
@HeikoS	since users as me are doing stupid things all the time :D
 lambday	yes point noted
 lambday	HeikoS: could you please try with a different diagonal matrix and test if that at least works?
@HeikoS	lambday: Ill update the gist
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/6381345
@HeikoS	this one uses random positive numbers on the diagonal
 lambday	this too gives poor result?
 lambday	any warnings on the way?
 lambday	for non-convergance?
@HeikoS	wrong result
@HeikoS	no warnings/errors
@HeikoS	oh CStatistics also give wrong results for a bit larger matrices
 lambday	the direct one?
@HeikoS	yes
 lambday	HeikoS: upto rational approximation of f(A)*v, everything is really accurate
 lambday	after that, things lose their shines :(
@HeikoS	lambday: well get there, maybe I did something wrong in the script
@HeikoS	have a look
@HeikoS	for matrix size 10, CStatistics and sum(log(diag)) is the same
@HeikoS	but the log-det estimator is off
 lambday	HeikoS: logdetestimator does the mean for you, right?
@HeikoS	lambday: but the shifts are set arbritary, this is the first thing to do
@HeikoS	lambday: yes
 lambday	yeah I should change that
 lambday	HeikoS: will do it by tomorrow

 lambday	HeikoS: how much does it deviate?
@HeikoS	lambday: there is something wrong its completely off
@HeikoS	not just inaccurate
 lambday	HeikoS: I can test this same thing with cpp, right?
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, best would to make unit tests from it
@HeikoS	lambday: but again, shifts might cause this, currently playing with them
 lambday	alright
 lambday	HeikoS: safe is 20+ I think
 lambday	but it should not be *completely* off
-!- van51 [~van51@ppp-94-66-64-167.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
 lambday	HeikoS: I noticed few such cases with gaussian samplers... where the solvers just refused to converged and we got awfully off results
@HeikoS	oh, speaking of it
@HeikoS	the normal sampler produces something even more weird
@HeikoS	with the probing sapler there is also something wrong
@HeikoS	it is way to fast with it
@HeikoS	even for 10000 samples
@HeikoS	whereaus the gaussian sampler takes a while
 lambday	that's weird! probing sampler gives #colors sampler per log-det-sample where normal samplers give 1 sample vector per log-det sample
 lambday	both relies on randgen
 lambday	argh I should add more and more tests.. HeikoS you will have a bunch of tests by tomorrow
@HeikoS	lambday: it will be a very good idea to create more tests around this
@HeikoS	lambday: its also very good that you tested every module seperately
@HeikoS	lambday: now we just need to make sure things work well together
 lambday	HeikoS: that's why its weird that we get these errors :(
@HeikoS	lambday: so if you turn the pyton example into a unit tests that works, thats already a lot
 lambday	HeikoS: upto rational approximation of f(A)*v things just work perfect!
 lambday	HeikoS: yes I will do that
@HeikoS	lambday: then we can do multiple ones for all these different cases
@HeikoS	and then. ozone :)
@HeikoS	my mcmc code is ready, just need the python function to compoute the log-det :)
 lambday	yes that's the final target
@HeikoS	would be great if that worked by next week since I will present this at a workshop soon
 lambday	HeikoS: that's gonna be a part of shogun too?
@HeikoS	https://sites.google.com/site/lgm2013ice/
@HeikoS	lambday: no not yet, maybe next gsoc
 lambday	HeikoS: whoa!
 lambday	HeikoS: will add these tests by tomorrow
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
 lambday	theoretically, this should not be the base
@HeikoS	I will be there tomorrow to help you on that
 lambday	so must be some technical silly mistake
@HeikoS	leaving to germany on the weekend though
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I am sure it is, it always is
@HeikoS	its good that we run into those now, not later
 lambday	HeikoS: next week you guys are going to US, right? :)
 lambday	HeikoS: yes :-/
@HeikoS	no thats oct
 lambday	okay
 lambday	I starred your gists.. you will have the tests by tomorrow
@HeikoS	sweet
@HeikoS	ok I will go home now
@HeikoS	see you tomorrow!

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you recall what I said how expensive the flight is?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: which flight?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: your?
 lisitsyn	66* something IIRC
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah no probably not
@sonney2k	I currently only find flights for 950EUR
 lisitsyn	that's in log right?
 lisitsyn	whoa
 lisitsyn	why
@sonney2k	if I want to be on the same plane like heiko
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: sonne|work823 with lufhansa over london
@sonney2k	looks like it got more expensive now
@sonney2k	:/
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what if not on the same plane?
@sonney2k	ahh no that was not taking the same flight back when I posted this
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the cheapest I can get is I guess around 700
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: the cheapest for me is 1K$ and the one that fits the time is 1.3K$
@sonney2k	well if 2 stops and 20 hour flight it would be 689
@sonney2k	but actually cheapest is now 813
 lisitsyn	eur?
@sonney2k	so I guess 950 is OK
@sonney2k	yes EUR
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: we have 1100 per person or?
@sonney2k	let me check how much I paid last time
 lisitsyn	1000?
 lisitsyn	I don't rembmer
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I think only 2200$ total
@sonney2k	we can try to get a bit more
@sonney2k	last year chris was coming from US -> cheap
@sonney2k	*argh*

 lisitsyn	and you to transferred to chris?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no idea how to get it to you
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	that's a real problem
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it can be paypal
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well I could go to an ATM in the us and give it to you in cash
 lisitsyn	if it works for you
 lisitsyn	yeah that's the easiest way
 lisitsyn	if it works for you
@sonney2k	ok so I will book this expensive bitch
@sonney2k	next year we have to book more early
@sonney2k	I think we could have saved 300 EUR in total

@iglesiasg	good evening comrades
 pickle27	evening
@iglesiasg	we should find out what's happening with Kyle's machine
 pickle27	yeah see if he can paste for us
@iglesiasg	it is because C++11 I think
@sonney2k	I guess so too
@sonney2k	he has been suffering for a bit too long :D
@sonney2k	actually :/
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I just got an email to accept your answer in the mailing list
@iglesiasg	wtf
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, nah
@sonney2k	I switched my main machine
@sonney2k	now all settings are gone
@sonney2k	I am finally back to work on a desktop
@sonney2k	notebooks suck :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, haha
@iglesiasg	powerful machine?
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	better than our new buildbot
@sonney2k	and it was idling here
@iglesiasg	why can it be that C++11 is not been recognized?
@iglesiasg	is there anyone around using gcc 4.4.7?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think our old buildbot
@sonney2k	4.4.5 even
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, this one http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/?
@sonney2k	one of them - I think slave3
@sonney2k	yes slave3
@sonney2k	the problem is that c++11 features got slowly introduced by compilers
@sonney2k	so they did support only a bit of it at some point
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but the thing I find weird is that I don't see these lines in Kyle's log
@iglesiasg	-- Performing Test _HAS_CXX11_FLAG
@iglesiasg	-- Performing Test _HAS_CXX11_FLAG - Failed
@iglesiasg	-- Performing Test _HAS_CXX0X_FLAG
@iglesiasg	-- Performing Test _HAS_CXX0X_FLAG - Success
@iglesiasg	maybe he didn't paste them though
@sonney2k	well CXX0X found - maybe someone used a CXX11 feature under the CXX0X brand
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, where do you see CXX0X found in Kyle's log?
@iglesiasg	what I pasted above is from the buildbot
@sonney2k	-- Performing Test _HAS_CXX0X_FLAG - Success
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok lets see what he says
@iglesiasg	yep
