 sonne|work	blackburn: One thing that is disturbing me too much currently is the configure script
 sonne|work	I will try to clean it up quite a bit
 sonne|work	and then again will try to get shogun to compile under osx / cygwin
 blackburn	sonne|work: I don't feel that disturbed with it.. but sure, it should be cleaned up
 blackburn	again? did you already get it compile under osx and cygwin?
 sonne|work	blackburn: no there where too many problems that needed to be resolved before
 blackburn	there where?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	:) got it

 supernaught	with regard to the configure script:
 supernaught	I had several warnings when compiling with g++ (GCC) 4.6.1 20110819 (prerelease)
 supernaught	specifically deprecation warnings.
 supernaught	Also, presumably you guys have decided to not use smart pointers for a reason, but have you considered using std::shared_ptr's instead of the user having to pass references into the library?
 supernaught	*deprecation errors when compiling the c++ library only
 supernaught	I wonder if you guys see these same warnings
 supernaught	(damnit: I meant warnings and not errors)
@sonney2k	supernaught, which warning?
 supernaught	I will have to recompile to find the exact warnings
 supernaught	I'll get back to you on that

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think shared ptrs are considerable?

 supernaught	I'm not requesting them, I'm just throwing them out there. I read shogun is nearly ten years old and thus predates smart ptrs by quite a while :)
 supernaught	*over ten tears old :)
