@lisitsyn	try to
 lambday	lisitsyn: I'm free now a days - getting fat! could use some brain work :P
 lambday	lisitsyn: let's finalize things on aer
@lisitsyn	lambday: what about porting some ideas into shogun?
@lisitsyn	one by one
@lisitsyn	say get/set by string/tag
@lisitsyn	then load library et
@lisitsyn	etc
 lambday	lisitsyn: I think we better start experimenting on a separate branch
@lisitsyn	hmm yeah probably

@besser82	sonney2k, what did i do?  :P
@sonney2k	<besser82> sonne|work, Fedora-builds are running for F20+ :D
@sonney2k	^ besser82 I guess that is related to shogun 4.0

@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  could you check this here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2676#issuecomment-71910913
@HeikoS	about making CKernel::compute virtual
@HeikoS	I wonder whether and how bad that is
@lisitsyn	HeikoS:hmm
@lisitsyn	let me check
@HeikoS	inline float64_t kernel(int32_t idx_a, int32_t idx_b)
@HeikoS	to
@HeikoS	virtual float64_t kernel(int32_t idx_a, int32_t idx_b)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: compute is already virtual?
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	its "kernel"
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: performance wise it doesn't matter
@lisitsyn	we already call normalize and compute which are virtual
@lisitsyn	but the idea was to always check indices
@HeikoS	thought so, but its another one
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	so as long as he does this its fine
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's the issue?
@lisitsyn	I mean why it has to be virtual?
@HeikoS	he want to change the thing
@HeikoS	because we need a kernel that can compute derivative wrt to some subset of data (inducig points)
@HeikoS	GP stuff
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: its actually good to have kernel non-virtual
@lisitsyn	you know it is a good practice to have public methods non virtual
@lisitsyn	just protected ones
-!- Floatingman [~Floatingm@c-68-52-34-232.hsd1.tn.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	can you comment on this in the thread?
@lisitsyn	yes
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@120.57.238.154] has quit [Ping timeout: 255 seconds]
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I glanced over thread
@lisitsyn	still not really get what's the issue with making it virtual
@HeikoS	I just wanted to know *whether* there is an issue
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f055128219.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	no I mean
@lisitsyn	why it is needed
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: whats fitc anyways?
@lisitsyn	I am looking and having no clue what's going on :D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	it is a sparse approximation to the likelihood in Gaussian process
@HeikoS	https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjmlr.org%2Fpapers%2Fvolume6%2Fquinonero-candela05a%2Fquinonero-candela05a.pdf&ei=XWLKVMe0M5exaby_gKgI&usg=AFQjCNHbrEj8Ii5dwq1jgsQ07HyJBpV6fg&sig2=um95-UBRojh6UeLVdvpwEg&bvm=bv.84607526,d.d2s
@HeikoS	http://jmlr.org/papers/volume6/quinonero-candela05a/quinonero-candela05a.pdf
@HeikoS	second
@HeikoS	its a good read
@HeikoS	and thats what wu wants to do
@HeikoS	http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v5/titsias09a/titsias09a.pdf
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thanks for the feedback
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay anyway - normalizer::normalize and kernel::compute are virtual
@lisitsyn	it would matter if no virtual functions involved

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: how do GP people handle categorial features?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: with kernel functions on categorical variables
@HeikoS	called diffusion kernels
@lisitsyn	anything else apart from just matches?
@HeikoS	no one can define kernels induced by categorical
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f055128219.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@HeikoS	you kind of get a gaussian kernel analogue even
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it better than just dot product = number of matched features?
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am trying to beat people at kaggle that's why asking :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/papers/diffusion-kernels.pdf
@lisitsyn	sounds like something smart
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what should be done to have it in shogun?
@HeikoS	check page 7 on left bottom
@HeikoS	the counting is a limiting case of this kernel
@HeikoS	its like a gaussian kernel using a hamming distance rather than a euclidean
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: any chance to learn that on 40M examples?
@HeikoS	mmmh
@HeikoS	hard
@HeikoS	but possible
@HeikoS	I will offer a GSoC project on that in fact
@HeikoS	low rank expansion of kernel (say incomplete cholesky) and then a conjugate gradient for the linear solves
@lisitsyn	if it makes me win this kaggle I take it :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: will this approx still be better than linear?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I want to take over this thing about REST interface
@lisitsyn	I think that's the way to win
@lisitsyn	no mature framework has REST
@HeikoS	the approx is basically doing linear in an approximate feature space

@lisitsyn	lambday: I just told HeikoS I am now interested in REST
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	wanna have some fun with that?
 lambday	lisitsyn: REST? as in REST API?
@lisitsyn	yes
 lambday	:P
 lambday	lisitsyn: I've been working on this only @job
 lambday	jersey :P
@lisitsyn	we absolutely should have a shogun server
 lambday	lol
 lambday	I don't think anyone ever did that for a ML library :P
@lisitsyn	ah and another thing
@lisitsyn	we should have something like MOE/spearmint
@lisitsyn	that's the way to go
@lisitsyn	I am 900% sure
 lambday	what are these?
@lisitsyn	model selection
@lisitsyn	via Heikoian stuff
@HeikoS	sergey is that really feasible ;)
 lambday	okay.. HeikoS is the guy for that :D
@lisitsyn	I mean bayesian
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: at least we can interface
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no need to be bayesian if you have 40M points on a linear regression model
@HeikoS	only if oyu have 40m parameters too
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: but my linear model sucks
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	160th/~1600
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	lambday: hey man how are things? :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well then
@HeikoS	make a better thing :)
 lambday	HeikoS: lazy
@lisitsyn	oh wanna join and consult me? :)
@lisitsyn	fair share
@HeikoS	good feautres and well tuned parameters do most
@lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	HeikoS: not too much work to do at job
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha
@lisitsyn	code is ready just tell me what to do :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ICML deadline
 lambday	ah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe, when does that end?
@lisitsyn	9 feb
@HeikoS	lambday: sounds good
@HeikoS	lots of time for shogun
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: too early
@HeikoS	icml is 6th
 lambday	HeikoS: we should get back to the big tests work - once you get free
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: try this: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03326
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah totally, currently working on submission of the above
@HeikoS	then another thing
@HeikoS	and then got time for big testing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah so I will read all these smart things till feb 9 of 2016
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	dino is also busy but should be better within a month  or so
 lambday	HeikoS: alrighty.. I'll work on the prototype for the implementation I was working earlier
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
@lisitsyn	okay actually I am like driven by kaggle things
@lisitsyn	it is a way to improve shogun also
@HeikoS	lambday: btw I like the linalg progress
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats great
@HeikoS	I mean there is so much to do
 lambday	lisitsyn: you participated?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I though about having a GSoC project on building a kaggle pipeline
@HeikoS	what do you think?
@HeikoS	for supervised prediction
@lisitsyn	lambday: trying to get to the top of avazu ctr :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: what's your current position :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: this needs real apriori experience
@lisitsyn	lambday: 160th
@lisitsyn	162th
 lambday	lisitsyn: not too bad! :D
 lambday	HeikoS: linalg has many more things to be included inside..
@HeikoS	btw i recently did a kaggle
@HeikoS	https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-detection/leaderboard
@HeikoS	got 9th :)
 lambday	HeikoS: good that with the new patch we can accommodate native implementations
* lambday bows
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, well done thats important if people have nothing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm what are your papers about if you weren't the first :D
@lisitsyn	jk
 lambday	HeikoS: which will hardly be the case :P but still good to have - since we can get rid of all linalg operations from SGMatrix/SGVector
@HeikoS	lambday: exactly
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: my papers are about buzz words, haha :D
 lambday	is any of the paid courses @stanford center of professional development worth the $$?
 lambday	I saw a course for some professional certification in large scale ML for $19k
 lambday	who does these courses!!
@HeikoS	lambday: Chinese people
@HeikoS	the ML MSc costs like 25k for chinese
@HeikoS	here in london
@HeikoS	and they are the largest group
 lambday	phew!!
 lambday	HeikoS: man you must absolutely love Bayes :P new paper is also about that :D
@HeikoS	lambday: sure :)
@HeikoS	its trendy
 lambday	HeikoS: btw is this a good time to merge a new patch, or shall we wait for a few days
@HeikoS	lambday: currently also working on infinite exponential family density estimates for hamiltonian dynamic MCMC :)
@HeikoS	lambday: why?
 lambday	HeikoS: no idea what that means.. know the individual words but don't know what it means when you put 'em all together :D
 lambday	HeikoS: regarding release..
@HeikoS	lambday: I see
@HeikoS	lambday: but we released right?
@HeikoS	lambday: so now put stuff in and use it to clean up shoguns code :)
@HeikoS	thats very good for a clean up release
@HeikoS	as no new features added but internals cleaned up and possible speed gain
@HeikoS	so merge it!
@HeikoS	its awesome stuff
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. so I'm merging the native implementation patch https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2672
@HeikoS	lambday: all tested etc right?
 lambday	yep.. travis fails are not related
@HeikoS	lambday: the native implementations are important since it allows us to use the interface before we got backends
@HeikoS	lambday: so now a sweep over Shoguns code that makes use of those methods is needed
@HeikoS	lambday: put it as an entrance taks and let sutdents do it?
 lambday	HeikoS: that's what I was thinking :D
 lambday	HeikoS: but first I'd like to move the linalg code from SG* to linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah very good stuff
