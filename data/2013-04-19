 foulwall	sonne|work: I've mentioned in the email. we need a module named importlib, just pip it on the server.
 sonne|work	foulwall: why do we need it?
 foulwall	sonne|work: since we need to import the function at runtime, and the old __import__ is messy.
 foulwall	sonne|work: importlib is just a wrapper of __import__
 sonne|work	foulwall: I don't understand why you need it though? Couldn't you just import everything statically?
 foulwall	sonne|work: for the extensibility. when a new demo is written, there's no need to modify the views.py, just put them in the demos' directory and they'll work.
 sonne|work	foulwall: ok I understand but for that you need to add checks that it doesn't import some random stuff
 sonne|work	otherwise this introduces security issues
 foulwall	it just import the modules with the prefix 'demos.'
 foulwall	when import something that is not exist, it respond with a 404

 foulwall	hide the funtion in the modules that is not permitted to invoke by user.
 sonne|work	foulwall: you basically have to make sure that no user input can harm the system
 sonne|work	so try to avoid imports based on user import
 sonne|work	function calls based on user input
 sonne|work	always only call hardcoded stuff when you see certain input

@iglesiasg	retweet it people!
 vgorbati	hi guys, I am trying to write a unit test according to https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/882, but when I run 'make' in shogun/tests/unit it runs 40 tests, without my newly added unit test (some other tests are missing too). However, the obj file is generated. Can anyone help me?
 foulwall	iglesiasg: retweeted and followed you
 wiking	wtf: mathematics/Statistics_unittest.cc:85:29: error: variable length array of non-POD element type 'SGSparseVector<float64_t>'
 wiking	who wrote this?!
 wiking	and who merged it?!
@iglesiasg	foulwall: nice, thank you!
 wiking	ok i know who wrote it....
 wiking	heiko i will kill u

 wiking	ok here's a very funny unit test that fails
 wiking	oh even better
 wiking	i have a segfault

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add unit test for ROCEvaluation
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: as currently this little example fails
 wiking	can anybody tell me why this unittest fails?
@iglesiasg	wiking: what does it say when it crashes?
 wiking	iglesiasg: [ERROR] assertion m_current_values.vector && idx<get_num_labels() failed in file labels/Labels.cpp line 57
 wiking	unknown file: Failure
 wiking	Unknown C++ exception thrown in the test body.
 wiking	if i do the set_labels(vector)
 wiking	it's even worse
 wiking	it just segfaults
@iglesiasg	wiking: mm I don't see what is wrong either
-!- abinash [75ef5e6b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.239.94.107] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	wiking: I think it will work if you creat an SGVector<int32_t> with the labels and you give this to the CBinaryLabels constructor
 wiking	iglesiasg: i've tried almost the same
@iglesiasg	but what you are doing you work too idd
 wiking	instead of giving it to the constructor
 wiking	use label->set_labels(vector)
 wiking	that segfaults
 wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	yeah.. but try using it in the constructor
@iglesiasg	I bet that will work
 wiking	but what is the difference?!
 wiking	i mean come on!
@iglesiasg	I am checking Labels code
 wiking	that *must* work
@iglesiasg	yeah, but I see something that might be weird
 wiking	yes for sure

@iglesiasg	wiking: does it work fine using the SGVector in the constructor?
 sonne|work	wiking: labels are copied with one
 sonne|work	(in constructor)
 foulwall	sonne|work: hi sonne.
 sonne|work	not with the set_labels()
 sonne|work	foulwall: hi!
 wiking	sonne|work: should we remove set_labels?
 abinash	Hello I want to submit a code for the issue Probabilities for SVMs. What is the workflow for code submission
 sonne|work	wiking: no
 sonne|work	wiking: it should work
 foulwall	sonne|work: Excuse me. and I've changed the demoHandler into a more security one.
 wiking	ctor version works
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, wiking : I think it might be something related to m_current_values and m_labels
 wiking	sonne|work iglesiasg [ERROR] assertion m_current_values.vector && idx<get_num_labels() failed in file labels/Labels.cpp line 57
 wiking	with set_labels(vector)
@iglesiasg	set_labels and what wiking was using does not set m_current_values I think
 foulwall	sonne|work: but it's a bit messy
 sonne|work	foulwall: btw please dont' do things like import * but just import what you need
 foulwall	sonne|work: I've changed that.
 foulwall	sonne|work: and i'll never do that.
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: ahh I see
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: maybe it is a bug, I am not sure though
 wiking	iglesiasg: well for sure it's a bug :)
 sonne|work	wiking: no
 sonne|work	we have 2 functions
 sonne|work	set_labels
 sonne|work	and set_values
 sonne|work	they don't set both
 wiking	sonne|work: set_label(idx, value)
 wiking	?
 sonne|work	only constructor does
 wiking	sonne|work: using set_labels(vector) and set_label(idx, value)
 sonne|work	that's not nice though - but no idea (currenlty) how to do it better
 wiking	will not work with ROC
 wiking	and this is a bug
 wiking	as we let this happen
 sonne|work	wiking: so do we ever want to be able to set these arrays *separately*
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: could you please help abinash?
 wiking	sonne|work: currently i have a usecase where yes i would like to
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: thanks for twittering...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: but what do m_labels and m_current_values represent? There must be a difference
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: no problem
@iglesiasg	hey abinash
@iglesiasg	abinash: we have recently started using git flow in our development workflow
 sonne|work	wiking, iglesiasg - yes sure there is a difference: consider e.g. binary labels. m_labels would then just be -1/+1 values
 wiking	and what the hell is set_values anyways?

@iglesiasg	abinash: see this mail on the mailing list for more info: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/3342
 sonne|work	wiking: the confidence values
 wiking	sonne|work: and then set_labels ?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: so m_labels would be the -1/+1 got it, but m_current_values?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: indeed no idea
 sonne|work	I guess some subset stuff?
@iglesiasg	I thought so
@iglesiasg	some of Heiko's magic for x-val
 wiking	mmm we need to enable unit testing on travis
@iglesiasg	wiking, sonne|work: even if it is not a bug, I think it is a bit confusing
 sonne|work	it is totally
 sonne|work	I don't understand it
@iglesiasg	I wouldn't understand why the test didn't work without digging into Labels stuff
 wiking	sonne|work: so now my answer for yesterday: shogun auROC: 0.900061 vs weka auroc: 0.955
 sonne|work	we have to ask hypergenious heiko to parse that I guess
@iglesiasg	maybe we should rename so stuff
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: sure, let's see what he tells
@iglesiasg	us
 wiking	sonne|work: so we are still off by a lot

-!- vgorbati [d4029f22@gateway/web/freenode/ip.212.2.159.34] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: so now what's happening is that i use PolyKernel with 2.0 exponent
 wiking	sonne|work: + normalize the input with p=2.0
 wiking	i.e. euclidean distance
 wiking	and use libsvm with C=1.0
 wiking	bias enabled
 wiking	epsilon set to 1E-12
 wiking	same settings in weka, using their smo
 wiking	and of course run it on the same train/test set
 wiking	i can right away try different kernels if u want me to, as i suspected that it should be better with other kernels
 wiking	and using kernel normalization does not change the auroc
 sonne|work	wiking: so with weka you use poly kernel
 wiking	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	in-homogeneous ?
 wiking	sonne|work: the non-normalized polykernel
 sonne|work	then dont' normalize data in shogun either
 wiking	yeah i've just tried both
 sonne|work	by default the poly kernel does
 sonne|work	set the identity kernel normalizer
 wiking	ok

 wiking	HeikoS: ARGH
 wiking	HeikoS: get to work ! :)
 HeikoS	wiking: ? :)
 wiking	HeikoS: today you have a lot of task :)))
 HeikoS	what
 wiking	HeikoS: well first of all u merged code that breaks unit testing
 HeikoS	just arrived at werk :D
 HeikoS	work
 HeikoS	oh
 HeikoS	thats good, which ones?
 wiking	HeikoS: second check the rocevaluator unittest
 HeikoS	already did
 wiking	HeikoS: as i have nooooo clue why that fails
 HeikoS	it fails?
 wiking	HeikoS: yeps big time :)
* sonne|work ~~~ooo~~~~~who~~let~~~the~~~dogs~~~out~~~ooo~~~~
 wiking	sonne|work: with identitynormalizer: 0.910194
 HeikoS	sonne|work: ha you are alright? :)
 HeikoS	wiking: what dies it return?
 wiking	HeikoS: well ASSERT error
 sonne|work	HeikoS: wiking is biting you already :)
 wiking	HeikoS: cd tests/unit && make
 wiking	and you'll see
 sonne|work	wiking: then don't normalize in shogun - like you do in weka
 wiking	sonne|work: i mean i'm normalizing the input itself
 wiking	sonne|work: i shouldn't?
 HeikoS	wiking:  does the buildbot fail?
 wiking	HeikoS: afaik buildbot doesn't run on develop branch
 wiking	or?
 HeikoS	I see
 HeikoS	oh thats not good
 HeikoS	I am confused
 HeikoS	the buildbot runs on master?
 HeikoS	and we commit to develop?
 HeikoS	why is that?
 wiking	HeikoS: yes
 wiking	HeikoS: because travis should do tit :)
 wiking	HeikoS: and it actually does most of it :P
 HeikoS	I see
 sonne|work	wiking: ohh man I guess you have to start from the beginning
 HeikoS	ehm?
 sonne|work	wiking: you got data - you normalize than save that data
 HeikoS	yes pls :)
 HeikoS	wiking so when does code migrate from develop to master?
 sonne|work	then use exactly that data in weka and shogun?
 wiking	sonne|work: L2Norm(input) -> PolyKernel(Exp=2.0) -> LIBSVM
 wiking	HeikoS: release
 sonne|work	wiking: nope
 wiking	sonne|work: that's the current pipeline for the data
 wiking	HeikoS: hahahah you grasped the most important part of the untittest :D
 HeikoS	wiking: I see
 HeikoS	what I dont really get is, why dont we run the buildbot on develop?
 wiking	HeikoS: i mean with your comment... the problem is that currently that little snippet fails
 wiking	HeikoS: hahahahahahahah
 wiking	HeikoS: travis not enough?
 HeikoS	wiking: so what does it return
 HeikoS	wiking: not all architectures
 wiking	HeikoS: [ERROR] assertion m_current_values.vector && idx<get_num_labels() failed in file labels/Labels.cpp line 57
 HeikoS	so if we have errors that would not be detected there we will only notice when migrating to master
 wiking	HeikoS: ok i guess then we have to discuss this with sonne|work
 HeikoS	wiking: I see, so this seems to be a different problem
 HeikoS	wiking: also this warning stuff, its so nice to see them in the buildbot
 HeikoS	wiking:  wait
 HeikoS	I actually saw commits by lambday compiling on the buildbot
 HeikoS	why is that?
 wiking	HeikoS: PR
 HeikoS	did he commit to master and I did not realise?
 wiking	or no
 HeikoS	explain for dumb people please ;)
 wiking	pr is not buildboted
 wiking	i have no idea
 wiking	HeikoS: explain me why that code fails
 wiking	;)
 wiking	i'm really dumb as well in that case
 HeikoS	wiking: ok will do
 HeikoS	wiking: I notices some warnings in lambdays code in the build bot log
 HeikoS	and then he fixed them and the warnings went away
 wiking	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commits/master
 wiking	because it was merged into master for some reason
 wiking	;P
 wiking	which is NONO NOOOO good
 wiking	but i guess you did not realise
 wiking	that he sent the PR
 HeikoS	no I did not
 wiking	for master branch
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commits/master
 wiking	 Merge pull request #961 from lambday/master ...
 wiking	dba5cb777c Browse code
 wiking	karlnapf authored 15 days ago
 wiking	;)
 HeikoS	I see
 HeikoS	okay
 wiking	dont lie my friend, github catches u
 wiking	;)
 HeikoS	haha
 HeikoS	so I have to make sure to merge into develop
 wiking	well just check the PR
 wiking	whether it's sent for master or develop branch
 HeikoS	ok
 HeikoS	good
 HeikoS	to know
 wiking	if it's coming for master branch
 HeikoS	and then travis catches things
 wiking	just drop it straight away
 wiking	we dont accept PR for master
 HeikoS	wiking, and then when we release we merge develop into master?

 HeikoS	wiking: okay! I knew this but forgot the check
 HeikoS	good that you tell me these things :)
 wiking	HeikoS: indeed we do the merging
 wiking	HeikoS: now it's going to be very interesting
 HeikoS	wiking: so could you add something to travis that collects warnings?
 wiking	HeikoS: becuase you got some stuff into master that is not in develop
 HeikoS	also for libshogun I would even vote to allow warnings as errors
 HeikoS	as for python
 HeikoS	but you have to ask sonne|work and lisitsyn on this
 wiking	HeikoS: so now we'll have to do some funky shit merging
 HeikoS	wiking: shit, sorry for that
 HeikoS	well, we can rebase right?
 wiking	HeikoS: heheh that's going to be a merge
 wiking	and not a simple rebase
 wiking	HeikoS: anyhow
 wiking	HeikoS: why is that unit test fails

 wiking	HeikoS: dont worry about that
 wiking	HeikoS: now it's ROC time
 wiking	ok? :)
 wiking	oooohooooo
 wiking	sonne|work: another problem :)))

 wiking	sonne|work: my input is DenseFeatures<float32_t>
 wiking	sonne|work: and lets say i want to use Chi2Kernel
 wiking	sonne|work: Chi2Kernel.cpp:61
 wiking	float64_t* avec= ((CDenseFeatures<float64_t>*) lhs)->get_feature_vector(idx_a, alen, afree);
 wiking	this will lead to a segfault
 wiking	:(
 wiking	i mean not this line
 wiking	but because of this
 wiking	soooooo
 wiking	how can we assure that no such case every can happen?
 wiking	i.e. if the input is not CDenseFeatures<float64_t>
 wiking	then at least it fails with an assert
 wiking	and not a segfault
 HeikoS	wiking:  easy explanation
 HeikoS	ROC works on the scores
 wiking	HeikoS: okok listening, what's the fix, is it already in?
 HeikoS	not the integer labels
 HeikoS	I suggest the following:
 HeikoS	add a proper error message instead of the assert
 HeikoS	then, change the test a bit so that value vector is set
 HeikoS	I will do that
 wiking	HeikoS: ok just you know that this is confusing a lot
 wiking	right?
 HeikoS	what?
 HeikoS	wiking:  the test is weird anyway
 wiking	HeikoS: well this that we have set_label and set_value
 HeikoS	ROC on binary integers doesnt make any sense
 HeikoS	set_value doenst work
 HeikoS	if the value vector is not set
 wiking	HeikoS: even if it doesn't make sense
 HeikoS	ok
 wiking	we should not die like this imo
 HeikoS	wiking: true
 HeikoS	we should have some thoughts on the label vs values vs scores design
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: ^
 wiking	holaaa!
 wiking	sonne|work: ok now i've beaten weka
 wiking	sonne|work: as i suspected ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: but i had the segfaults because of the prev error i was mentioning
 HeikoS	wiking, sonne|work, lisitsyn we should have better error messages: I think it would be good to include the name of the method one is in class::name(): Error message
 HeikoS	I never know where the asserts are coming from
 wiking	HeikoS: lisitsyn sonne|work we should have a discussion about this: we have DenseFeatures<T> but then for example in some preprocessors and kernels have DenseFeatures<float64_t> hardcoded... this will cause segfaults... :(
 wiking	somehow it'd be great if we could do this part automatically
 wiking	e.g. add a preprocessor to the DenseFeature and that will use the right 'version' (template paramter) of the preprocessor
 wiking	any thoughts on this one?
 HeikoS	wiking: the test might also fail if you have only labels from one class (might happen since random is used)
 HeikoS	better to use odd/even for labels
 wiking	HeikoS: heheh ok ok
 wiking	HeikoS: i admit
 wiking	not the most sofisticated test
 wiking	i just wanted to push something to show that something is wrong atm
 HeikoS	wiking: I see, thats good

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 HeikoS	lambday: hi!
 lambday	should we always use SG_MALLOC while initializing SG-classes?
 HeikoS	lambday: just a quick note: if you are doing PR's please always do them on the develop branch
 HeikoS	lambday: the SGVector SGMatrix etc are treated differently
 HeikoS	we have automatic reference counting for them
 HeikoS	you *always* create them on the stack
 HeikoS	rest is done internally
 HeikoS	so always SGVector=SGVector(10)
 HeikoS	never SGVector*=new SGVector(10)
@lisitsyn	do not do SGVector a = SGVector(10);
@lisitsyn	do SGVector a(10);
@lisitsyn	:)
 wiking	hahah :)
 HeikoS	lambday: you heard the man :D
 wiking	lambday: now u know :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it creates an object two times
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes you are in fact right
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: could you help in rebasing the develop branch against master?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: alright let me check
 HeikoS	wiking: how can I see the travis for my PR?
 HeikoS	ah found it!

 HeikoS	lisitsyn: what do you think of warnings as errors for libshogun and python_modular on travis?
-!- lambday_ [3ba2174d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.59.162.23.77] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS	we have to remove those anyway
 lambday_	sorry I got disconnected
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: doc warnings?
 HeikoS	in particular I like them for python since doxygen comments cannot be forgotten
 lambday_	in one of my previous PR, I did something like SGSparseVector<float64_t> v[size-1];.... viktor and sonne|work pointed out that its not right
@lisitsyn	I do not like that
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, and also libshogun gcc
 HeikoS	why?
@lisitsyn	I'd rather get rid of all the dummy doc we have
@lisitsyn	it is useless
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, do not merge dummy doc
 HeikoS	but the warning thing then helps you remembering to check
 HeikoS	since I tend to forget
 HeikoS	and others do to
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes but it is not an error
 HeikoS	to get rid of dummy is responsibility of PR merger
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: okay agreed
 HeikoS	what about gcc warnings?
 HeikoS	my point is just: we tend to collect them
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I do not mind treating them as errors
 HeikoS	since its easy to oversee
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we should enable -Weffc++ :D :D
 HeikoS	whats that?
@lisitsyn	warnings from the effective C++ book by meyers
 HeikoS	what do they tell you?
@lisitsyn	I expect thousands in shogun
@lisitsyn	virtual destructor, operator=, blabla
 HeikoS	I dont wont to be mean to people, just want to avoid piling up warnings
 HeikoS	but I guess one can also just check the warnings
 HeikoS	wiking: could we collect them in travis and output at the end? or make it yellow as in the buildbot?
 wiking	HeikoS: :))) google?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so we want to rebase develop on top of last commit in master/

 wiking	lisitsyn: kindof
 HeikoS	vgorbati: in order to make your unit test being executed, just use similar naming to the existing files
 HeikoS	lisitsyn:  exactly
@lisitsyn	I am curious if it would work without force push
 wiking	lisitsyn: merge
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah merge is the only possible thing I see
@lisitsyn	wait wait
 wiking	i didnt touch anything
@lisitsyn	wiking: but we have it already
@lisitsyn	wiking: develop is on top of master d10e022a23a26b51e73a217c5014f3cf8d879ee6
@lisitsyn	there is nothing to merge
 HeikoS	sonne|work: could you explain me the problem with the sparse vector
 HeikoS	why is SGSparseVector v[size-1]; wrong?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: []?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: ??
@lisitsyn	SGSparseVector v[size-1];
@lisitsyn	what does it mean?
 foulwall	sonne|work: Hi there?
 HeikoS	Ah
 HeikoS	I see!
 HeikoS	I guess he meant (size)
 HeikoS	with round brackets?
 HeikoS	thats how I read it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: with [] it probably means create vector v and get its size-1 element
@lisitsyn	I'd expect a segfault there
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
 HeikoS	I was confused
 HeikoS	what am I saying
 HeikoS	I am confused ;)

 juanmanpr	I am studying master in computer vision, and im really interested in machine learning
 juanmanpr	i have experience in C, C++, Matlab, and a little python
 HeikoS	juanmanpr: we are looking for motivated people than can code and have some background in the topic their project is about
 HeikoS	juanmanpr: the best way to get involved is to start sending patches and discuss project ideas
 HeikoS	with the mentors

 juanmanpr	ok, where can I finf a list of menthors for shogun?
 HeikoS	on our ideas page
 juanmanpr	thanks, i'll take a look
 HeikoS	there is no "hard" requirement, you just have to convince us of you :)
 HeikoS	as a computer vision student, you should have the right background
 juanmanpr	You also would like to see some code, right?
 HeikoS	so just show us that you can code and are motivated by sending patches :) see our issues list on github for initial tasks you could do
 HeikoS	yes, it is a requirement for your application to be considered
 HeikoS	not only show
 HeikoS	but actually merged to shogun codebase

 dvalcarce	which part do you prefer?
 dvalcarce	because right now i think we are doing duplicated work on django side
 dvalcarce	i think we should define some basic interfaces
 foulwall	both are ok, and the front end needs more creativity.
 dvalcarce	i agree, bootstrap is beautiful but it isn't enough

 dvalcarce	we need server communication, but we don't want a ddos
 foulwall	dvalcarce: yes.
 dvalcarce	some kind of authentication?
 dvalcarce	or maybe it is too overhead because of some demos?
 foulwall	dvalcarce: auth is easy to implement but we need somekind of elastic way to make the demo code extensibility
 foulwall	dvalcarce: code reuse and general interface
 foulwall	but a general interface may cause some function exposed to the bad user.
 dvalcarce	we can implement data size or computing time limitations

@lisitsyn	vgorbati: what you may do now is to replace this 100% check with something weaker
-!- sidbee [~sidbee@202.78.172.162] has quit []
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: experimentally find some percentage, that will pass?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: kind of
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: you may check the other thing though
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ?
@lisitsyn	whether weights are preserved
@lisitsyn	like for any vector x in initial space
@lisitsyn	the linear combination weights are the same
@lisitsyn	for initial space and embedded space
 vgorbati	well, that will complicate things a little bit)
 vgorbati	it's like doing the big part of LLE itself
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess I can't receive the neighbors weights from CLocallyLinearEmbedding somehow, can I/

@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: join me listening to scanner :D
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I admit I am feeling bad already have been listening to it a hour or so
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: let me check
@iglesiasg	I have never listened to it
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ma-rt-9-window-cam?utm_campaign=t.co&utm_source=6807252&utm_medium=social
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: btw, have you seen? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/990
@iglesiasg	nice code I think
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes sure
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: what is this man?
@iglesiasg	is it like the police radio
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	that wouldn't make sense
@lisitsyn	exactly
@lisitsyn	why not?
@iglesiasg	how is it possible we can listen to it?
@iglesiasg	shouldn't it be secret? hehe

@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: boston PD asked to not share addresses/etc but you can't control the internet you know
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: they are deadly tired
@lisitsyn	19th or 20th hour already
@iglesiasg	someone must be helping him IMHO
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: helping like?
@lisitsyn	2 guys
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: helping like keeping him at a place
@lisitsyn	ah they are going to fail this time
@iglesiasg	I bet he is at somenone's place
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	yes may be
@iglesiasg	just gut feeling
@lisitsyn	they have scanned basically all the city already I guess
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: they are going to have a trouble with sunsetting
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: why?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: if they haven't found it with daylight..
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: 6 streets left
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: are they actually going house by house?
@iglesiasg	checking inside, I guess not
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes
@lisitsyn	actually
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: not the detailed inside I guess by yes - door-by-door
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: but this radio thing is fucked up
@iglesiasg	I mean I don't understand
