@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw we cannot easily remove svmlight - it would kill other (efficient) learning code when dealing with string kernels and MKL
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the only way I see is to make the GPDT SVM do everything svmlight did but it is work
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I see
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 lisitsyn	pong
 lisitsyn	;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heiko wrote a few more notebooks and we are closer to debian packages now :)
