 besser82	gsomix:  congrats!
 sonne|work	gsomix: cool!
 sonne|work	gsomix: so now you are free?
 sonne|work	besser82: hey!
 sonne|work	besser82: can you do the include order thing for adrin?
 sonne|work	besser82: I mean just adding the include?
 besser82	sonne|work:  working on that; it seems to be a bit more complicated, than just adding that...
 besser82	sonne|work:  I'm currently tracking the way all includes get stacked into the CMake-vars...
 besser82	sonne|work:  Since we need to make sure it *always* is the first one
 sonne|work	yeah. is it not that you can just put it in th einclude_dirs first?
 sonne|work	besser82: or is cmake reordering things?
 besser82	sonne|work:  it's mot just cmake; it's way the CMakeLists are setup
 sonne|work	besser82: not sure what you mean?
 besser82	sonne|work:  someone who did the include-stuff actually PREpends all the new includes to the global-var
 sonne|work	besser82: ohh I see
 besser82	sonne|work:  like set( INCLUDES "newshit" ${INCLUDES})  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: that is the way I did it in configure back then
 sonne|work	maybe
 sonne|work	don't remember
 sonne|work	so I guess it is a result of that
 besser82	sonne|work:  I possibly found a solution...  lemme check...
 besser82	sonne|work:  but that is not gurateed to work with *all* compilers...
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun

 besser82	sonne|work:  that should make sure they are set *BEFORE* any other include...
 sonne|work	ok
 besser82	sonne|work:  looks like it works....
 besser82	sonne|work:  lemme do some cleanups && push
 besser82	sonne|work:  shall i push directly to `develop` to use featurebranch && PR?
 besser82	sonne|work:  s/to/or/
 besser82	sonne|work:  would actually just be one commit, so easily revertable...

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix include-order to fix build when shogun-headers present in system-dirs
 sonne|work	besser82: thanks a lot
 sonne|work	adrin_: give it a try besser82 likely fixed your issue.
 besser82	sonne|work:  np  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: btw I was messing with debian shogun python package
 besser82	sonne|work:  kaputt?
 sonne|work	besser82: it is tough ... trying to build for python 3 / 2 at once
 besser82	sonne|work:  you simply need different build/-dirs
 besser82	sonne|work:  like cd build && cmake ..  and cd build-py3 && cmake ...
 sonne|work	besser82: in debian that is all automagic
 besser82	sonne|work:  but does python3-interfaces really work?!?
 besser82	sonne|work:  is it?
 sonne|work	besser82: gsomix fixed things up - so they should
 besser82	sonne|work:  with units?
 besser82	sonne|work:  erm...  testing?
 sonne|work	might be that we have a few python2 things in notebooks though
 sonne|work	not tested
 besser82	sonne|work:  gna
 besser82	sonne|work:  no tests, no fedora / RHEL
 besser82	sonne|work:  are you really forced to use all debhelper automagic in debian?!?
 sonne|work	besser82: gna?
 sonne|work	besser82: I better do
 sonne|work	besser82: well notebooks are run at night for python2 but not 3 - actually nothing is run for python3 yet
 besser82	sonne|work:  gna like damn it  ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: any chance you have time to set that up?
 sonne|work	besser82: gna like urgs
 sonne|work	kk
 besser82	sonne|work:  set what up?
 besser82	sonne|work:  nb && stuff for py3?
 besser82	sonne|work:  Testing stuff is more important  :-P
 sonne|work	besser82: well our buildbot could just get another py3 test
 sonne|work	no we have the tests
 sonne|work	we just need to run everything with py3 installed
 sonne|work	besser82: I mean there is no difference - you just need to install python3 and compile
 besser82	sonne|work:  I see;  lemme try that on Fedora buildzzz  ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: what?
 sonne|work	question is whether we broke everything
 besser82	sonne|work:  :D
 sonne|work	wiking: a separate buildbot test for python3
 besser82	sonne|work:  That's what scratch builds good for  :-P
@wiking	sonne|work: it's in travis
 sonne|work	wiking: can we also have it on the buildbot please so we can compile notebooks too?
@wiking	sonne|work: no
@wiking	no time for that sorry
@wiking	of course if anyboyd else has time for it go for it
@wiking	but python3 doesnt work at all
@wiking	it needs extensial amount of work to get it compiling ...
 sonne|work	wiking: why that? it did work with the configure a year back
 besser82	wiking:  will it?
@wiking	sonne|work: it did not ever work
 besser82	wiking:  swig should do all the needed workz  ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: it did -  gsomix fixed things up and we had it in release notes IIRC for 2.0
@wiking	sonne|work: the thing that it compiled does not mean that it worked
@wiking	yes it compiled
 sonne|work	wiking: no he could run *all* examples
@wiking	have u tried running examples?
@wiking	well see travis bot
 sonne|work	he fixed up the examples
 sonne|work	travis py3 bot doesn't run
@wiking	again. see travis bot's output
 sonne|work	like not at all
 sonne|work	not even attempting to compile
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: the problem on travis is, that it cannot build e.g. numpy  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: that would need work
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: lemme check the py3 stuff with some fedora-scratch-builds  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah but on debian / fc we have python3-numpy already
@wiking	besser82: u mean scipy
@wiking	besser82: and u mean that it runs out of lines ...
@wiking	right?
 besser82	wiking: yes
@wiking	what's the new empty 'allowed to failed' build doing?
@wiking	is that clang?
@wiking	btw the problem is that now it doesn't use the wheel packages
@wiking	which i dont really get because they are there
@wiking	so the thing is that this should install numpy and scipy from whl package instead of trying to compile it from src
@wiking	but this has changed recently seems
@wiking	as it worked in the past
@wiking	besser82: any ideas for that?
@wiking	ok i think i know why
 besser82	wiking:  compile failes, because the is not FORTRAN-compiler present  ;)
@wiking	besser82: no it's not that
@wiking	besser82: as said above i dont want it to compile it from source
@wiking	i want it to isntalling it from wheel package
 besser82	wiking:  no idea about that, currently...
 besser82	wiking:  lemme check after I tried to scratch build on fedora

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: 2to3 fixes for python examples
 besser82	wiking:  there is another problem  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  the tests should be run with some py3 interp
 besser82	wiking:  currently we are using the py2 interp when running them  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  and to get all shiatz running with a py3 interp, we need to fix / change some more bits...
 besser82	wiking:  like da scriptlet in Version.cmake and doxy2swig

 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|work:  ^^^
@wiking	besser82: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/16583442#L518
@wiking	besser82: it works on travis
@wiking	besser82: but as u can see examples fail
 besser82	wiking:  yes, all errors boil down to "one simply cannot use py3-compiled.so with py2 interp"  :-P
@wiking	besser82: ?
 besser82	wiking:  like da stuff about pickle'ing and such
@wiking	that thing there uses python 3.3 both for interpreter and library
 besser82	wiking:  nope
 besser82	wiking:  the is *always* python2 in minimal inst of ubuntu / debian
@wiking	i guess this is why it says
@wiking	-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython3.3m.so (found version "3.3.3")
@wiking	and
@wiking	-- Found PythonInterp: /home/travis/virtualenv/python3.3_with_system_site_packages/bin/python (found version "3.3.3")
@wiking	besser82: that travis task is not a minimum installed ubuntu
@wiking	or debian
@wiking	it's actually a modded install by travis to have python 3.3
@wiking	...
@wiking	so it's not because of different version of python lib and interperter
@wiking	that's why actually there's an enforcer for this in cmakelists
 besser82	wiking:  lemme check twice in my setup  ;)
@wiking	besser82: well regardless of your setup
@wiking	the thing that fails in that travis task
@wiking	is not because of what u said ...
@wiking	it's just because there's a problem currently supporting 3.3 with shogun
@wiking	besser82: i've been working with this like for 2 months back in summer so i know what were then the problems and they still remains as nobody touched it
 besser82	wiking:  then we should split off the module to python3_modular  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  or sth
 besser82	wiking:  to make use of the `-py3` switch in swig
@wiking	besser82: u realised that we use that... right?
 besser82	wiking:  nope, because travis doesn't use verbose make  :(
 besser82	wiking:  and don't know any specific bits of the cmakelists  ;)
@wiking	besser82: obviously as there is the max 10000 lines log limit on travis
@wiking	besser82: git grep "-py3"
@wiking	or git grep "\-py3"
 besser82	wiking:  alright seen it  ;)
@wiking	so it has nothing to do with either of the stuff you've mentioned.... it's just because there are stuff that are not python3 ready both in swig generated interface and some of the scripts (see python_modular integration tests)
 besser82	wiking:  nevertheless:  doxy2swig will fail with py3, too
@wiking	besser82: well that's the least of our concerns
@wiking	as that is some documentation problem and not functional bug
 besser82	wiking:  and version.cmake, too, when building from release-tarball  ;)
@wiking	as said
@wiking	least of our problems concerning python3
 besser82	wiking:  kk
@wiking	currently it fails functionally.. until that is not fixed
@wiking	python3 is just out of the story
@wiking	now that to support doxy2swig and release tarball
@wiking	that's like doable within 10 minutes
@wiking	the others hardly

 sonne|work	well so few?
 sonne|work	I am surprised that it basically works

 besser82	iglesiasg:  on travis
 besser82	iglesiasg:  lokks like there is sth. br0k3n on your sys...
@iglesiasg	besser82, ok.. I can live with that. Not interested at this moment of using java for this :)
 besser82	iglesiasg:  can you try with a clean VM, plz?
 besser82	iglesiasg:  kk
@iglesiasg	besser82, I can try with the OpenJDK and we can find out if it is related to using Oracle Java
@iglesiasg	although I guess it has nothing to do with that due to the type of error
@iglesiasg	so I think I will just forget about it
 besser82	iglesiasg:  buildbot.shogun uses ShitracleJDK  and has no error   ;)
 besser82	iglesiasg:  If you don't need java atm then let's forget
 besser82	sonney2k, wiking: what might this shiatz be related to?  https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/16605587#L4622

@sonney2k	besser82, what did I miss?
@sonney2k	Hey thoralf! Happy new year to you too!
 thoralf	:)
@sonney2k	HOpe to see you around next monday too!
 thoralf	sonney2k: In IRC or somewhere in real life?
 thoralf	Hybrid virtual meeting ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, I have to be here doing kids babysitting
@sonney2k	so no way to escape to c-base or so
 thoralf	Too bad.  I'll see what I can do. :)
 thoralf	Would be a good chance to push my other uncommitted changes...

 pickle27	do we have links to the build bots anywhere? I can never remember how to get to that page
@sonney2k	pickle27, sure sure
@sonney2k	pickle27, and hey happy new year too :)
@sonney2k	pickle27, buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org
 pickle27	yes happy new year!
@sonney2k	pickle27, btw we now have the sgt.eu domain too
 pickle27	maybe we should put a link to that page on the contact page
@sonney2k	pickle27, so we can do things like  http://sgtb.eu/SVM
@sonney2k	pickle27, as shortlinks for documentation that you can use in your notebooks for example
 pickle27	handy!
@sonney2k	pickle27, I should actually make buildbot.sgtb.eu work too
@sonney2k	pickle27, voila http://buildbot.sgtb.eu/
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah it would be nice to have these all in...
 pickle27	nice!
@sonney2k	pickle27, if you have time to help out with the website I can give you access to it
 pickle27	hmmm I probably won't have time to do much
@sonney2k	pickle27, then feedback - where you would expect what on the website at least please :)
 pickle27	I was thinking on the contact page
 pickle27	anywhere really
 pickle27	or a new tab for status?
@sonney2k	pickle27, contact page? what do you suggest?
@sonney2k	pickle27, and what should status do?
 pickle27	maybe have a status header after Mailing List and place links to the buildbot and travis CI
@sonney2k	pickle27, we currently have that under doc: http://sgtb.eu/page/documentation/resources
 pickle27	ahh then that answers my original question
@sonney2k	pickle27, well if you cannot find it who can...
 pickle27	hmmm maybe we should have a documentation tab like we do and a developer tab
 pickle27	and put that page there
 pickle27	we might be able to consolidate news and events to make room
 pickle27	I could mess around on a fork of shogun web
 pickle27	and take some screens
 pickle27	there is a way to run the site locally yes?

@sonney2k	pickle27, anything more clean structure wise is highly appreciated
@sonney2k	pickle27, even if it is just a plan
 pickle27	okay I'll see what I come up with!
 pickle27	simple is good too!
