 ChrisD_	hi
 blackburn	hi
 ChrisD_	has anyone seen this error with shogun 1.0.0 when switching to a guassian kernel? [WARN] Thread creation failed (thread 0 of 14) with error:'Success'
 blackburn	ChrisD_: no, what is your os?
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, do you have a small example to reproduce?
 ChrisD_	redhat
@sonney2k	*small and reproducible*
@sonney2k	and which $LANG is this
 ChrisD_	python module
 blackburn	sonney2k: would you mind to place arpack and lapack things into mathematics/libs?
@sonney2k	blackburn, why not just mathematics/ ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well no difference
 blackburn	hehe
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, please give us an example such that we can debug
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb6d03b7 / (6 files): move inline functions from .h to .cpp - http://git.io/FLiwIA
 ChrisD_	sure just looking for the exact line where this fails
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, thx
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu

@sonney2k	Re
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf55f818 / (14 files in 2 dirs): Added single precision LAPACK and ARPACK support, changed preprocessors according to new interface - http://git.io/QZd-HQ
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r236bb14 / (8 files in 3 dirs): Merge branch 'master' of github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun - http://git.io/PKr5ig
 blackburn	sonney2k: single precision is now supported
 blackburn	single precision NLDR preprocessors to go
@sonney2k	OK
 blackburn	OK? :)
@sonney2k	you mean in addition to double precision
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: in single precision we could embed even 20K vectors
 blackburn	*on my machine
 blackburn	*without so much pain
@sonney2k	I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: the only problem I see - how to template only for float32_t and float64_t?
 blackburn	will implementing it only for float{32,64} work?
 blackburn	ah nevermind, I will think about it
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	code duplicating is pretty bad way
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, blackburn I found a simple way to trigger the issue: just run regression_svrlight_modular.py with 10 threads
 shogun-buildbot	build #303 of libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/303  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
@sonney2k	ahh we need heiko
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	my fault
 ChrisD_	Thanks, how do i go about printing the line number where it occurs?
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rea5f083 / src/shogun/preprocessor/KernelLocallyLinearEmbedding.cpp : Removed wrong include from KLLE - http://git.io/rJAmzQ
@sonney2k	obj.io.enable_file_and_line()
@sonney2k	where obj is some shogun object
@sonney2k	#$#J@KL$J%!?!!!
@sonney2k	who thinks windows 7 is *the* evolution
@sonney2k	one cannot even install it
@sonney2k	blackburn, wouldn't it be nice to have some function in evaluation for the curve stuff that gives you the bias to achieve a certain fpr / tpr etc?
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please also move the inline functions from the evaluation/*.h to the .cpp?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think it is better to have just one arpack.h/cpp and then implement everything underneath via templates
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, I don't understand why it is failing...
@sonney2k	does not make any sense
 ChrisD_	where can i find the necessary data files to run the example file?
 ChrisD_	maybe i can make sure that code produces the same error
@sonney2k	ChrisD_, just do git submodule update --init from the git root dir
@sonney2k	shogun/ folder
@sonney2k	(not shogun/src/shgoun)
 blackburn	sonney2k: still here?
 blackburn	(01:04:37 AM) sonney2k: blackburn, wouldn't it be nice to have some function in evaluation for the curve stuff that gives you the bias to achieve a certain fpr / tpr etc? ---------- didn't understand
 blackburn	(01:04:37 AM) sonney2k: blackburn, wouldn't it be nice to have some function in evaluation for the curve stuff that gives you the bias to achieve a certain fpr / tpr etc? -------- will do
 blackburn	(01:23:01 AM) sonney2k: blackburn, I think it is better to have just one arpack.h/cpp and then implement everything underneath via templates ---------- I can't because both single and double precision superlu headers will fail if described in one file
