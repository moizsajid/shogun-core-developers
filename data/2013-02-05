 shogun-buildbot	build #759 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/759
 sonne|work	blackburn: are the *.hpp of tapkee required when compiling once libshogun is installed?
 blackburn	sonne|work: no
 sonne|work	k
 blackburn	sonne|work: tapkee is fully template based
 sonne|work	so it is wrapped inside shogun and nothing needs to be known outside later right?
 blackburn	exactly
