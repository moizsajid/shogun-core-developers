 daemonslayer	I would like to know how shogun handles large datasets for algorithms. By large I mean any size > RAM. Does the code use memory mapping or some other procedure?
@wiking	 daemonslayer depens which model
 daemonslayer	Consider an algorithm that requires multiple access to data.  Also the number of parameters is high.
 daemonslayer	And a not too high amount of noise but practical amount. Data has average noise levels.
