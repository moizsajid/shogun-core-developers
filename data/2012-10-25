 wiking	sonney2k: hey
@sonney2k	ptizoom, so can you check back if it works now?
@sonney2k	wiking, ho
@sonney2k	ptizoom, what is a bit worrying is the linking to the PDL Core.so
@sonney2k	ptizoom, it is totally unclear to me how to figure out where that thing is located
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n183-p114.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	ptizoom, btw you might want to first just do the typemaps
@sonney2k	and not focus on getting serialization / directors to work
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so what's your plif question?
 wiking	sonney2k: i was just wondering when r they going to announce
 wiking	the sprint docs stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, announce?
@sonney2k	what do you mean?
 wiking	i mean the result
 wiking	who's in and who's not
@sonney2k	wiking, first I have to write the proposal
 wiking	sonney2k: lol ok :)
@sonney2k	and then asap I know
 wiking	so they haven't announced an official announcement date
@sonney2k	wiking, but I am mentioning you, n4nd0, blackburn and heiko
@sonney2k	wiking, well I asked - within one week
 wiking	ok
 wiking	if u need help with the proposal
 wiking	let me know
@sonney2k	though if you look at who participated last year - it were only huge organizations like kde etc
 wiking	hheheh
 wiking	yeah i guess it's like apache and gnome and stuff
@sonney2k	we will try anyways
 wiking	cool
@sonney2k	though we for sure need a polished web site and a blog entry about our gsoc experience
@sonney2k	wiking, btw can you send me a few lines what cool methods you implemented in gsoc such that I can include that in the blog post
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you too?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah sure
@sonney2k	(a figure would be much cooler but none of you except heiko produced one)
 wiking	ehhehehe
 wiking	i'll make the xkcd figures :P
@sonney2k	alright off the plane to the train
 wiking	sonney2k: i should be able to get you something now because i'm trying to finish up this article
 wiking	and i need to have figures as well
@sonney2k	re
@sonney2k	wiking, well we have to apply by tomorrow
@sonney2k	that means updated website + blogpost due tomorrow too
@sonney2k	can you produce sth in time?
 wiking	mmm will try my best
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the plif question is solved
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will mail about what I implemented in gsoc a bit later today
