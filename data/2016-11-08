@wiking	you have svm

@wiking	b) the domain of C

 lisitsyn	ahh
@wiking	that was above it
 lisitsyn	maybe it makes sense to separate
@wiking	because we want to be able to enforce
@wiking	the actual value of C
@wiking	already on the API sde
@wiking	so that one can only give valid values
@wiking	or you would have an internal mapping
@wiking	only visible in the implementation
@wiking	that say
 lisitsyn	I would go for something like
 lisitsyn	you have svm kernels etc
@wiking	param C = RangeValue
 lisitsyn	then you create some thing
 lisitsyn	like
 lisitsyn	make C be exp range 1 to 10
 lisitsyn	make kernel a set of gaussian and linear

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this is not only for modelselection

@HeikoS	also callback functions should be possible to define things like prior distributions to sample from

@wiking	if that's a valid value for
@wiking	C
@wiking	then you just pass that
@wiking	i mean RangeValue->get() would give you back the value
@HeikoS	in some sense
@HeikoS	the values should be stored as before
@wiking	or any operator you wish
@wiking	yeah but should be encapuslated
 lisitsyn	ok the thing we should decide
 lisitsyn	is
@HeikoS	but just when registering the variables as parameters, once should be able to give domain information
 protino	@wiking http://pastebin.com/sDjUi3bb
 lisitsyn	do we go for composite parameters
@HeikoS	to have some model meta information in there without changing the representation of the variables in the class
 lisitsyn	I mean do we always assume svm has *a set of C values*
 lisitsyn	(in general case)
@HeikoS	protino: run "make meta_examples"
 lisitsyn	I somehow like it but it's a change
@wiking	protino, and what happens when you run make meta_examples
@HeikoS	wiking: I think this might be cmake bug :)
@HeikoS	cmake config error i mean

@wiking	can you pastebin that content?
 protino	yep.
@wiking	lisitsyn, i mean for me that is quite elegant
@wiking	that you can validate & have the domain at once
 lisitsyn	yes do we all agree
 lisitsyn	that in general case there won't be single parameter of svm
 protino	@wiking http://pastebin.com/BNHtyAxp
 lisitsyn	there always be some set or distribution (or any other domain)
@sukey	Issue #3519 "write a NOTEBOOKS.md readme"- https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3519
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: wiking: ^
@wiking	HeikoS, i think you fired that issue before it actually made sense :)
-!- zero1hac [~zerooneha@139.59.16.180] has joined #shogun
@wiking	protino, i reckon you have a missing dependency
@wiking	thats why gaussian_process_regression.py is not generated
@wiking	and but cookbook is not aware that it should not look for it
@wiking	lisitsyn, yeah i reckon that that'd be a case
@wiking	i mean in worse case the parameter is any number
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: ok we need to fix that as well I guess?
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	it is the guards
 protino	@wiking thanks i will work on that :)
@wiking	lisitsyn, but yeah i would 'box' it still
 lisitsyn	box?
@wiking	like java boxing
@wiking	you know
 lisitsyn	yes
@wiking	not a primitive type anymore
@wiking	it's an object etc.
 lisitsyn	no primitive
 lisitsyn	object
 lisitsyn	but abstract object
@wiking	yep
 lisitsyn	and no templates please
 lisitsyn	they are incompatible with interfaces
 lisitsyn	:P
@wiking	:D
@wiking	true
@wiking	i was just starting a conversation man
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	ok then lets have base class domain
 lisitsyn	an iterator + sampler
@wiking	the reason i pinged you
@sukey	New Comment on Issue #3520 by karlnapf: "This comes since `FindMetaExamples.cmake` sometimes removes certain meta examples.
@sukey	The cookbook should still build fine, just ignoring that particular page.... " - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3520#issuecomment-259215305
@wiking	because you are much better in this than any of us here
@sukey	Issue #3520 "`make cookbook` fails when certain cookbooks are guarded"- https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3520
@wiking	yeap the iterator sounds good
@wiking	and then what if it's like
@wiking	unset variable
@wiking	and AnyDomain
 lisitsyn	not sure if we need any domain
@HeikoS	iterator ??
@wiking	then basically nextValue() returns (double)random()
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	ah
@HeikoS	think of optimization algorithms
@HeikoS	they want to propose the next value
@HeikoS	from gradient or whatever
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes also gradient
 lisitsyn	or something
@HeikoS	but the parameter itself cannot know that
@HeikoS	you can only do that to generate a-priori values
@HeikoS	but for me this is more about telling a parameter about its domain
@wiking	ok but then you need like a validator function? :D
@wiking	boolean operator()
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	but then you can change representation
@HeikoS	to an unconstrained domain
@HeikoS	i.e. you do gradient descent for a positive variable
@HeikoS	you just do gradient descent in log-space and exponentiate after every step
 lisitsyn	but you don't change domain when you started optimization?
@HeikoS	thats different thing, that is runtime thing
@wiking	HeikoS, but that search would be done on primitive types no?
@HeikoS	we are here talking about things that are fix at compile time as they are linked to the model
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah sure
@wiking	i mean you woulnd't like run the gradient search on those boxed parameters
@HeikoS	no you wouldnt
@wiking	lisitsyn, ^ ?
@HeikoS	so there is two things here: allowing users/coders to restrict values at their wishes
@HeikoS	but there is also model parameters (like svm C) that have to be positive
@HeikoS	no matter what
@HeikoS	if if I search for C
@HeikoS	I do that in an unconstrained space, say real line
@HeikoS	and then I take exp after
 lisitsyn	why compile time?
@HeikoS	for the actual value
@HeikoS	because C is always positive
@HeikoS	not matter what
 lisitsyn	we won't have any compile time thing at all
@wiking	yeah actually true
@HeikoS	sorry, I mean model definition time
 lisitsyn	ah
@wiking	we should not depend on compile time :P
@HeikoS	but thats different to user selects subset of domain
@wiking	(nod)
@HeikoS	or like user defines search space for grid search
 lisitsyn	ok ok lets make domain an entity
 lisitsyn	entitify it :D
 lisitsyn	what can we do with domain?
@wiking	:>>>
 lisitsyn	and what can domain tell us?
 lisitsyn	I have two things in mind
@HeikoS	the whole idea came up because of this:
 lisitsyn	we can retrieve all its values
@HeikoS	horrific construction:
 lisitsyn	and we can sample a value
 lisitsyn	what else?
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/kernel/GaussianKernel.cpp#L99
@HeikoS	and we have a few of those explicit reparametrisations
@HeikoS	since they are needed
 lisitsyn	well I don't see a problem with that - is it?
@HeikoS	but here for kernel bandwidth, it just makes much more sense to store the log value
@HeikoS	well automate this thing
@HeikoS	git grep 'must be positive'
@wiking	lol
@HeikoS	I gotta run, sorry :) lets discuss more later
@HeikoS	I mean with me, you two go ahead :)
@HeikoS	protino: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3520
@HeikoS	protino: bundle nlopt, then this should work, but it is a bug in our configuration script
@HeikoS	protino: check the FindMetaExamples.cmake file, there some of them are excluded if some dependency is not met
 lisitsyn	ok let me think about it then
@HeikoS	if you install all dependencies (or bundle them), then it should work
@HeikoS	protino: but you can also just use the website cookbook, and look at the generated example code listings locally
 protino	yep. well i wanted to contributed to cookbook so once i start writing them i would need to run them locally.
 protino	*contribute

@wiking	protino, if you are too lazy
@wiking	you can always send in prs
@wiking	and check the output
@wiking	of the PR buildbot
@wiking	;)
 protino	@wiking thanks. i will try to resolve it else resort to buildbot :)
@wiking	yeah but nlopt should solve your problem
@wiking	or send in the patch that skips cookbooks
@wiking	for which you dont have the dependency
@wiking	either is fine
@wiking	:)
@sonney2k	wiking, where is that script doing the ipynb parsing?
@sonney2k	wiking, seems like you didn't fix the title of nb's yet right?
@wiking	sonney2k, no idea :)
@wiking	sonney2k, all notebook relates stuff
@wiking	is in infra repo
@wiking	it's not autodeploy yet
@wiking	so ping me if you updated things in it

@sonney2k	wiking, gmane is dead http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun
@wiking	yep
@sonney2k	so our mailinglist archive is gone
@wiking	i know
@sonney2k	do we have a replacement
@wiking	we need to enable
@wiking	archive
@wiking	in our mailman
@sonney2k	it is not mailman
@sonney2k	or did you convert the list?
@wiking	no
@wiking	i didn't touch
@wiking	but i remember a mailman -like admin site :D
@sonney2k	I thought that was for gsoc
@sonney2k	wiking, nice that we have a shogun tag on stack overflow now :)
@wiking	\p/
@sonney2k	btw what happened to shogun-cloud?
@sonney2k	the link is broken on the website too..
@sonney2k	and the interactive examples?
@sonney2k	all gone?
@wiking	sonney2k, working on it
@wiking	but we didn't want to wait with the release
@wiking	since it's a bigger revamp
@wiking	but soon soon
@wiking	demos is still existing
@wiking	maybe redirection needs fixing
@sonney2k	wiking, the website doesn't cover them anymore (well not working now but still nice demos IMHO)
@wiking	http://demos.shogun-toolbox.org/regression/svr/
@wiking	works
@wiking	just no reference
@sonney2k	wiking, so where do we put the references?
@wiking	anywhere
@wiking	but be ncie :)
@sonney2k	we used to have screenshots and some wheel thingy
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	shogun-web repo woudl have that for sure
@sonney2k	hell nips.cc is sold out this year
@wiking	lol
@wiking	:)
@wiking	bcn is popular
@sonney2k	well cheap to get to from europe..
@sonney2k	and cool
@sonney2k	agreed
@sonney2k	almost as hip as berlin is :P
@wiking	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06049v2.pdf
@wiking	:)
@wiking	hahahaha
@sonney2k	I don't know where to put it on the site
@sonney2k	wiking, can't kevin invent something nice?
@wiking	dunno
@sonney2k	I must be the super web guru by now...
@wiking	he is not around for a long time
@sonney2k	of course not he likely has a life :P
@wiking	:>
@sonney2k	wiking, so we have sgtb.eu
@sonney2k	shogun.ml
@sonney2k	shogun-toolbox.org
@wiking	yes
@sonney2k	did I forget any :P
@wiking	not that i know of
@sonney2k	wiking, another broken link http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/contributions
@sonney2k	See our list of integrated external libraries.
@wiking	mm
@sonney2k	wiking, okido ... let me get some sleep
@sonney2k	cu!
