 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : there?
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: yes
 ishaanmlhtr	i just trained the LibSVMMulticlass classifier and applied it to my test data
 ishaanmlhtr	the accuracy came out to be 0.121666666667
 ishaanmlhtr	can it be improved somehow?
 ishaanmlhtr	took C=1
 ishaanmlhtr	and width =2.1
 ishaanmlhtr	is this accuracy good enough? or something can be done about it>
 blackburn	no, it is bad for sure
 blackburn	what are sizes of train/test set?
 ishaanmlhtr	600 each with 28*28
 blackburn	how many examples of each class?
 ishaanmlhtr	I would have to find a way to see that.
 ishaanmlhtr	I'll tell u in a while
 blackburn	for label in set(labels):
 blackburn	  print label, labels.count(label)
 blackburn	something like that
 ishaanmlhtr	ya,ok
 blackburn	12% is pretty useless classifier, something goes wrong here
 ishaanmlhtr	ok..at least 50 of each are there
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: you should try different Cs and widths
 ishaanmlhtr	ok, any particular range to try in?
 blackburn	something like C: 1e-2, 1e-1, 1, 10, 100, 1000
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : i am getting the current prediction as all belonging to class with most examples
 blackburn	how many example have this class?
 blackburn	examples*
 blackburn	has*
 blackburn	:D
 ishaanmlhtr	79
 ishaanmlhtr	rest none has above 65
 blackburn	ah *all* predictions&
 blackburn	?
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : i din't get you.
 blackburn	are all predictions of svm identical?
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : ya , all belonging to class 1
 ishaanmlhtr	which has around 79 examples in the trained set
 blackburn	is it a first class?
 ishaanmlhtr	the 2nd
 ishaanmlhtr	first is the one with label =0 having 58 examples
 blackburn	try C=1000
 ishaanmlhtr	ok,
 blackburn	and width 1,10,100,1000,10000
 blackburn	do you normalize images? is it in range 0-255?
 blackburn	I would suggest to normalize it with dividing / 255
 ishaanmlhtr	i dint do any normalization as such . but ya, they were in the range 0-255
 ishaanmlhtr	ok
 ishaanmlhtr	i would try all these options.
 blackburn	it should be better this time
 ishaanmlhtr	ok.
 ishaanmlhtr	i'll try and get back to you.
 blackburn	ok
 ishaanmlhtr	getting 87.83%
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : i am getting 87.83%
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: much better now :)
 ishaanmlhtr	C=100,1000 width =100
 ishaanmlhtr	yaa..:)
 ishaanmlhtr	but not able to improve beyond it by changing whatever values of C and width
 ishaanmlhtr	How did that normalization help out btw?
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: well it is a common practice
 blackburn	numerical issues, etc
 blackburn	and width of kernel depends on normalization too
 ishaanmlhtr	ok. and this changing of the values of C and width - do we have a better way of cross validation
 ishaanmlhtr	instead of just changing these values and testing
 ishaanmlhtr	?
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: yes
 blackburn	it was a project of Heiko Strathmann this summer :)
 ishaanmlhtr	ok..the documentation is available?
 blackburn	I'm afraid no good documentation yet
 blackburn	check modelselection_* examples
 ishaanmlhtr	ok,fine
 ishaanmlhtr	and what else can i do now except training more and more classifiers on this MNIST database
 ishaanmlhtr	?
 ishaanmlhtr	can you suggest me something?again for learning purposes only
 blackburn	well you can clean up your application and get it into shogun/applications
 blackburn	or yes I could come with something
 ishaanmlhtr	the MNIST one?
 ishaanmlhtr	ok,i could do that!..:)
 blackburn	unfortunately I guess we are not able to include MNIST dataset
 blackburn	so you would have to write a downloader too
 ishaanmlhtr	ok,that means automatically the files get downloaded from the source page when i call upon my application?
 ishaanmlhtr	and then the processing starts?
 blackburn	well yes, but once
 ishaanmlhtr	hmm..alright,i could give it a try for sure.
