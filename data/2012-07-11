 blackburn	nothing more
@sonney2k	blackburn, I thought you did say this...
@sonney2k	maybe it is a bot after all
 blackburn	I'm pretty sure he did
@sonney2k	real name 'The rieck'  - hah :))
@sonney2k	but with a goettingen login (where he is now a professor)
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	hmmh I hope I can catch gsomix tomorrow...
@sonney2k	anyways nite everyone...
 blackburn	bad hope
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	tomorrow
 blackburn	not today :)
 blackburn	tomorrow probably
 n4nd0	sonney2k: good night
 blackburn	ah btw I will be online tomorrow's night only - will leave city for a day to wildprogram :D
 wiking	sonney2k: yes it did
 wiking	sonney2k: that that'll take some minor redesign to have it for latent svm
 wiking	sonney2k: gnite
 wiking	asdf!@#$
 wiking	this CDualLibQPBMSOSVM  and CPrimalMosekSOSVM support is giving me a hard time...
 n4nd0	wiking: tell me if I can help you with the CPrimalMosekSOSVM ;)
 wiking	well it's more like supporting both at the same time
 wiking	that's giving me a headache atm
 n4nd0	ahm
 n4nd0	good night guys

 foo__	hi
 foo__	question about using mkl classifier: I am not very familar with kernel combination and I would like to interpret a little bit my results: when I print the weights I get values in descending order and the first weight is equal to 0.95 and all the other < 0.01.
 foo__	is the first weight corresponding to the first kenel : I mean first ker->append(sub_ker) ?
 foo__	When I evaluate each kernel separatly I get accuracy btw 0.5 and 0.8 then I dont get why the first kernel have a such big weight.
 foo__	maybe it is dependent of the number of MKL iterations I choose. How to choose it ?
@sonney2k	foo__, did you normalize your kernels?
@sonney2k	yes weights are in order

 os252	hi puffin444
 puffin444	hello os252
 os252	how is it going?
 puffin444	better. I finally submitted the pr yesterday.
 os252	yes, great. I am just looking through the PR
 puffin444	I wanted to at least include some unit tests, but some stubborn memory bugs ate up my time.
 os252	Yes, it's a quite a bit of code that came together by now!
 os252	do you have some python demos or similar with plots?
 puffin444	Not in the current pr, but it would be easy to add them.
 os252	yeah... I guess best if we discuss what to add before moving on to the icing on the cake.
 os252	What had you in mind?
 puffin444	Well as you said the unit tests
 puffin444	I don't think it should be too much of a hassle to add those
 os252	Great, I think it's worth it and if you don't add them now they'll never make in there ;-)
 puffin444	This approximates the derivative, correct?
 os252	Yes, it is a numerical approximation that allows for comparison with the analytic one.
 os252	And in terms of kernels?
 os252	I see the Gaussian, linear, sum and product which is a very solid set to build on.
 os252	Have you looked at the ARD variants?
 puffin444	Yes. Again it should be an almost trivial task at this point to add other ones.
 puffin444	For linear kernels?
 os252	Linear + Gaussian would be good.
 os252	Agree, it's just mainly cleaning up this firs part such that it can be useful in practical applications already.
 os252	So that makes ARD variants of lin+gauss, unit tests for gradients of kernels and demos.
 puffin444	What else do you think needs to be done before I move on to sparse approx/laplacian inference?
 os252	I think those points are quite relevant at this stage.
 os252	+ basic demos that show their use. At the end of the GSOC period it would be great to really push for a couple of very nice demos but perhaps it's best to do this once all the functionality is on the plate.
 os252	Thus, I'd suggest to now create some basic python demos that solve regression tasks with a standard Gaussian kernel + sum kernel and create the typical sausage plots.
 puffin444	Okay.
 os252	You could then towards the end try to get some examples on bigger datasets in which would be really cool to have!
 os252	once sparse things work, etc.
 os252	What do you think, how much time does this take?
 puffin444	For the demos/unit tests, I don't think more than a day or two.
 os252	ok, great.
 puffin444	The ARD variants might add a day or two, because ARD itself is not implemented yet.
 os252	I'd just add 2 new kernels.
 os252	GaussianARD and LinearARD
 puffin444	I am sorry that the sum/product kernel gradients took so long. There was a lot more code to change around than I thought.
 puffin444	Okay.
 os252	Yes, I do realize. Underestimated the efforts to get this into shogun myself. I am not that deep in the shogun code. Looks like it's not in very good shape.
 os252	So that makes 2-3 days, let's say 4.
 os252	Meaning beginning of next week you could start seriously looking into the sparse things.
 puffin444	Yes.
 os252	How about we initiate discussions to make plans in parallel?
 os252	I'll be traveling beginning of August for 14 days, 7 of which I'll be difficult to reach. Perhaps best to try and make use of the time before then to take the key decisions.
 os252	Have you read this:
 puffin444	Yes.
 os252	http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1194909
 os252	That's the most comprehensive review on the sparse stuff.
 puffin444	I also have the GPML examples to for comparison.
 foo__	Question: how to normalize a kernel (c++) ? There is a kernelnormlizer initialized with the kernel constructor. How to use it ?
 os252	In which context?
 os252	You should not normalize really as the hyper parameters are optimized.
 puffin444	The GPML has sparse approximation methods
 foo__	I trying to work with mkl machine and I should normalize the kernels before "append" method
 foo__	how to ?
 os252	Yes, the question is which ones to add first, etc.
 os252	I honestly don't know the shogun functions for kernel normalization but still don't get the motivation
 os252	The MKL is just an approach to learn the weighting of the combinator (sum) kernel.
 os252	"just"
 os252	In the GP world you'd achieve the same thing by learning the hyper parameters through optimization of the marginal likelihood.
 puffin444	os252, any more questions?
 os252	not from my side - but would be curious to hear what you planed with the MKLmachine
 puffin444	that's foo__, not me :)
 alexlovesdata	foo__: you could use custom kernels and normalize them outside in your preferred style. This is what I do
 os252	Oops. Sorry foo__ puffin444: this IRC client has a very suboptimal color scheme assigning both of you the same non-legible color.
 os252	ok puffin444, do you want to catch up some time to discuss the sparse methods? I suggest you take a look at that review and based on this and the existing code base you should get a good overview.

 os252	Easiest would be some subset of regressors sparse model first, which essentially ignores some of the training data, choosing an "intelligent" subset.
 os252	That's probably the thing to start with.
 puffin444	Would Friday/Saturday be a good time to discuss this?
 os252	yes, both good but we need to email. My father is in hospital and I'll go and visit this Friday. I can email tomorrow when I have a better clue how my schedule looks like, ok?
 puffin444	Ok, sounds good.

@sonney2k	puffin444, now it looks good
 puffin444	okay good.
@sonney2k	puffin about sgvector / sgmatrix
@sonney2k	you just need to do SGVector<float64_t> x = y;

@sonney2k	no need for ptrs, freeing of memory etc
 puffin444	oh where do I do that?
@sonney2k	puffin444, ?

 blackburn	hey what's up
@sonney2k	puffin444, so do you think your patch can be merged?
@sonney2k	puffin444, as I understood you left out the 'experimental' sgvector/matrix stuff
@sonney2k	blackburn, please also have one last look
 puffin444	I made the fixes you prescribed. I left out that experimental sgvector/matrix stuff
@sonney2k	puffin444, ok so then good from my side
@sonney2k	blackburn, any comments?
@sonney2k	puffin444, btw did you submit your evaluation?
 puffin444	Yes. Thanks for reminding me. For some reason I thought they came next week.

 blackburn	aham dictionary parameters
 blackburn	sonney2k: did cwidmer send?
 puffin444	what's wrong with the dictionary parameters?
 blackburn	puffin444: nothing wrong at all - I was just curious how will you approach your problem
 puffin444	The dictionary builds a mapping of parameters to the objects that own them. This includes the current sgobject and any sgobjects which it owns as parameters
 blackburn	sonney2k: I glanced over puffin444 PR - looks ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, everyone did send :))

@sonney2k	puffin444, not your fault
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think I finally understand when this happens
@sonney2k	when we change anything in configure
@sonney2k	but someone already committed stuff locally long before
@sonney2k	(the required change to configure)

 puffin444	How did that fail? That should be fixed.
 puffin444	Investigating now...
@sonney2k	puffin444, when you do a merge instead of a rebase all commits that are now in upstream/master will be put on top of what you did
@sonney2k	puffin444, so this explains all the crap we see now
@sonney2k	all failures we've seen - we will see again now
@sonney2k	puffin444, so stop investigating until it is at the very last commit

@sonney2k	lots of other interesting stuff in there
@sonney2k	blackburn, e.g. communication via IRC makes it more likely that people to succeed

 gsomix	sonney2k, yep, I managed to how hack swig, hehe. I'm writing some stuff now, results will be li-i-i-i-ttle later.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw this is not yet with the 'avoid copying' stuff right?

@sonney2k	I wonder what needs attention...
@sonney2k	...and is not too boring :D
@sonney2k	or awful :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: like coding?
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, I just have read numpy code. it seems, that is easy
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw what's up with the doc/tutorial? I've seen you added an empty readme
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but didn't manage to add something yet
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok well one step after another
@sonney2k	blackburn, why don't you just add the stuff you had for your dim red toolbox?
