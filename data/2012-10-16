 sonne|work	heiko1: you might want to twitter about ptizoom's perl port efforts too :)
 heiko1	sonne|work yeah I already had that in mind :)
 heiko1	sonne|work my girlfriend just told me that I should also add #-tags and do not use smileys :)
 heiko1	sonne|work, is the perl stuff already working?
 sonne|work	it is good that you have a professional next to you :)
 sonne|work	heiko1: some parts like vector/matrix typemaps IIRC but only in ptizoom's fork
 sonne|work	(see the PR)
 heiko1	sonne|work, ok, I thought with blackburn that we could actually tweet anything that goes to the NEWS file. So when the PR is ready, Ill do it :)
 sonne|work	heiko1: it is even good to advertise work in progress - or call it : call for help
 heiko1	sonne|work, well ok, Ill do that then, but will distribute it a bit over the days :)
 heiko1	sonne|work, how are things in berlin btw?
 sonne|work	heiko1: btw I will be going to gsoc mentor's summit from this friday on
 sonne|work	so in case you have some questions to related projects / issues bugs or so that you know in software you depend on - now is the time

 wiking	blackburn: yo,
 wiking	blackburn: does clang_complete work for you in SGVector.cpp? i had a problem with including Eigen/Dense, but once i've resolved that (adding the include path it into .clang_complete) it still does not want to autocomplete, but i don't even get an error message in :copen
 blackburn	wiking: no actually I have to change include to eigen3/Eigen/Dense
 blackburn	when I want autocomplete :)
 ptizoom	heiko#:hi, I do not do twitter.(!)..use github ...check comments on pull request to see the state of perl port... I need a second view on the config file to complete the make install!
 ptizoom	I stopped the perl porting  a bit, and try to do an auto translator for translating python example into perl !!!
 ptizoom	shall be easy with a Gibbs/Markov machine, to create the perfect LAR parser?

 blackburn	sonney2k: any ideas whom to talk with?
