-!- zxtx [~zv@c-98-223-196-32.hsd1.in.comcast.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 devl82	i can see that you use helper functions for precomputing the square parts of the kernel. However browsing the other kernels, precomputing is not implemented (even for the short gaussian)
 devl82	i am just wondering if there is a specific reason for this (except data space)
 devl82	thank you for your time

@HeikoS	kislay: ehm ...
@HeikoS	kislay: well make sure to point out your patches
@HeikoS	kislay: and really make sure to have a plan what to do there, I think the project was not too specific yet
@HeikoS	kislay: so talk to kevin and discuss your ideas with him
@HeikoS	kislay: you want to efficiently fill 3 months with it and that need quite some planning
 kislay	yup! thats true. I worked around with the gist he told to study. looks like I have to have a detailed discussion with him.
@HeikoS	kislay: yeah, and try to come up with some cool ideas on your own.
 kislay	yeah! sure sure!!
@HeikoS	kislay: I mean there is loads to do, its a very interesting and open project, so you could really do some cool things
@HeikoS	kislay: also kevin knows quite a lot about opencv, make sure to exploit that when writing your application
@HeikoS	kislay: also, this has the potential to create loads of interesting visualisations :) looking forward to hear about those
@besser82	wiking, you new cmake-magic-autodocs fails for me:  https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/getfile?taskID=6630415&name=build.log&offset=-5000
 kislay	HeikoS, After working on ipython notebooks, i now understood what you meant by a 'eye candy'.
 kislay	:)
@HeikoS	kislay: yeah, those are cool aren't they?
@HeikoS	kislay: how is the work on the notebook going?
 kislay	yup!! you know,  after doing  those , my understanding of the PCA got crisp :)

@HeikoS	cameo54321: so whats up?
 cameo54321	I was going through the code of Gaussian and prob distributions
 cameo54321	issue 1919
 kislay	HeikoS, I will get the notebook work done. It's just that I haven't used Latex much
@HeikoS	kislay: cool!
@HeikoS	cameo54321: ah yeah, let me check that
 cameo54321	Now that we are inclined to use stan as less as possible, I was wondering how should they be unified?

 cameo54321	HeikoS Sorry 1929
@HeikoS	cameo54321: so the first point is the interface classes
@HeikoS	cameo54321: abstract base classes for distributions in general
@HeikoS	cameo54321: independent on backend
@HeikoS	cameo54321: like in the kameleon mcmc code
 cameo54321	HeikoS: Ok
@HeikoS	cameo54321: distributions with interfaaces for computing the log-pdf for single points, batches, gradients, hessian, sampling, etc
@HeikoS	cameo54321: once this interface is done, we can start filling things (first one would be to put in the Gaussian)
 cameo54321	HeikoS:  Ok
@HeikoS	cameo54321: then for the next ones, try to use c++11 stuff, if thats not available go for boost
@HeikoS	cameo54321: or maybe look into the stan code for some distributions, we can take it as its bsd
@HeikoS	cameo54321: we can still take the general structure from stan
@HeikoS	cameo54321: but being able to represent distributions in shogun properly would already be great
@HeikoS	cameo54321: there are a few classes for distributions that also have maximum likelihood methods etc, that should all be unified,
@HeikoS	cameo54321: its a quite open-task, thats why its entrance
@HeikoS	cameo54321: more about design that actually implementing algos
@HeikoS	cameo54321: although we can polish the Gaussian, for example add low-rank versions or so
@HeikoS	cameo54321: does that solve the question?
@HeikoS	cameo54321: I gotta go, flight starts soon
 cameo54321	HeikoS: Yes That was quite good
 cameo54321	Thanks
 kislay	HeikoS, I came up with a superb idea last year(when everyone here was obsessed with android dev.). You take a snap of a sudoku from a newspaper clipping and then you play in your android phone. but later i found it implemented :(.
 kislay	you can play it in your flight :)
