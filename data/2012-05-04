 SeattleDad	I'm trying to install shogun for lua on Mac OSX
 SeattleDad	I'm getting a problem when I do make install
 SeattleDad	It says:
 SeattleDad	install -m755 modshogun.dylib "//usr/local/lib/lua/5.1"
 SeattleDad	and then I get
 SeattleDad	install: modshogun.dylib: No such file or directory
 SeattleDad	I don't see this modshogun.dylib anywhere

 gsomix	morning :)
 wiking	sonne|work: what happened?
 sonne|work	wiking: I am singing
 sonne|work	guess that must be some lack of sleep thing
 wiking	ahahahah :D
 wiking	yeah that usually is a good indicator
 gsomix	it's time to compile deadbeef player. I need music.
 gsomix	sonne|work, how are you?
 sonne|work	tired
 sonne|work	but sgvector is making good progress
 sonne|work	I am very happy with the result
 sonne|work	it is soooooo much easier to use
 sonne|work	wish we had that w/ other SGObjects

 sonne|work	karlnapf: hey
 karlnapf	hi
 sonne|work	karlnapf: I was fixing a few sgvector related things in modelselection/xval
 sonne|work	and I stumbled across your hack
 karlnapf	sonney2k, which one? :)
 sonne|work	SGVector<char> m_dontremember;
 karlnapf	oh year, that wasnt actually mine
 sonne|work	where you then later assign m_donot.vector / vlen
 karlnapf	somebody inserted that
 sonne|work	haha me then :D
 karlnapf	however
 karlnapf	lol :)
 sonne|work	problem is that it really needs careful workarounds to work well with the new stuff
 sonne|work	-> not nice
 karlnapf	ok, but this is avoidable isnt it?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: actually I remember you used SGVector<void> !
 karlnapf	lol, yes even worse ;)
 sonne|work	yeah it should be
 sonne|work	maybe you have an idea if you look at it
 karlnapf	ok Ill check
 sonne|work	sgvector fixes are relatively simple
 karlnapf	have you seen the email about appended features for group lasso?
 sonne|work	usually related to some additional SG_FREE(v.vector)
 sonne|work	etc
 sonne|work	didn't have time for that yet
 karlnapf	kk

 karlnapf	The term "features" might be a fit fuzzy there, but maybe its worth investing some more time into the appended features
 blackburn	hey there
 karlnapf	good morning honey :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: oh our relationship have got some progress this night I guess :D

 sonne|work	karlnapf: dont' get in my way - I am already engaged with blackburn!
 karlnapf	:D I always knew that will happen
 karlnapf	sonne|work, you arent a liberal person! ;)
 blackburn	double gay marriage hmm too liberal for any EU country I'd say
 blackburn	 Log Message:  -----------  move next release date to ~september'12
 blackburn	sonne|work: hah
 blackburn	I hope september would be enough
 sonne|work	why not?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes would be great release
 blackburn	sonne|work: however 2.0 is the version I think :D
 karlnapf	guys, I will be off for some studying, be back later this afternoon/evening, have a good day
 blackburn	karlnapf: enjoy your study time ;)
 karlnapf	thx :)
 gsomix	blackburn, h
 blackburn	gsomix: hhhhhhh
 blackburn	sonne|work: it looks like cheng suggests to construct multiple features for group LASSOs
 blackburn	it contradicts with my approach pretty much

 sonne|work	blackburn: it is like mkl........
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah today everything is like mkl :)
 blackburn	but still - what do you prefer?
 blackburn	to use any structures like task/features relations in machines
 sonne|work	if you have multiple sets of features it is mkl
 sonne|work	group lasso
 sonne|work	or whatever name you give it

 eric___	hi all
 sonne|work	(and learn group feature weights...)
 sonne|work	hi
 blackburn	sonne|work: no in group lasso you just use this relations - not learning weight afaik
 blackburn	sonne|work: actually it is a little bit crazy - you can group outputs, features and tasks

 pluskid	how's the sgvector hell?
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:f2de:f1ff:fecf:a6a5] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 pluskid	sonne|work: just made a very brief scan of the current SGVector.h, and find two suggestions here
 pluskid	1. operator=, I think the correct semantic for operator= is first to unref() what current holding and then ref() what is assigned new
 pluskid	2.  I think clone() method isn't properly implemented: the memory is allocated but no ref-counting is setup, I think the memory allocated here will never be freed, because unref() just returns without freeing the memory when it find m_refcount == NULL
 pluskid	and the destructor do nothing more than calling unref()
 sonne|work	pluskid: things are improving :)
 sonne|work	not too bad
 sonne|work	pluskid: why the operator= stuff? I mean we don't need to unref since the object is on stack
 pluskid	sonne|work: unref maintains the memory (the "vector" member variable), not the object :)
 sonne|work	clone is not yet done :)
 pluskid	operator= means the object already exist
 sonne|work	and the destructor should just do unref no more
 pluskid	and you want to assign it to something else
 pluskid	no, the semantic is this:
 sonne|work	pluskid: clone is for getting a copy of sgvector (including the memory block)
 pluskid	SGVector<int> v1 = ...
 sonne|work	so it is different from copy constructor, assignment operator
 pluskid	v1 = SGVector<int>(...)
 pluskid	then operator= will be called
 pluskid	so here we need to unref what v1 is already holding, and then ref what is newly assigned

-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	sonne|work: about the clone, I'm concerning the newly allocated memory will never be freed, unless you do explicit SG_FREE(v.vector) somewhere
 pluskid	the current implementation of clone
 sonne|work	clone is not yet implemented
 pluskid	oh, OK
 sonne|work	clone would be
 sonne|work	return SGVector<T>(clone_vector(vector, vlen), vlen);
 sonne|work	no more than that
 pluskid	hmm, true
 sonne|work	pluskid, regarding what you said above
 sonne|work	no one thing is copy constructor
 sonne|work	and the other is assignment operator
 sonne|work	things won't be done twice
 pluskid	copy constructor is totally different from operator=
 sonne|work	yes
 pluskid	and I think in operator= we need to release previous resource before accepting the new resource
 sonne|work	why that?
 sonne|work	the previous thing will still remain
 sonne|work	if you have
 sonne|work	SGVector x;
 sonne|work	SGVector y;
 sonne|work	and you do x=y
 sonne|work	x will be killed
 sonne|work	and y and x will hold the thing
 sonne|work	so only when y & x are destroyed should refcount be equal to zero
 pluskid	no, in our current implementation: x and y will hold the thing but the previous content of x will lost
 sonne|work	ahh now I understand
 pluskid	cool!
 sonne|work	so I should just call unref() in operator= as first line and all good right?
