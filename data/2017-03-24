 lisitsyn	wiking: :*
@wiking	lisitsyn, do u know if eigen uses simd
@wiking	if you use array?
@wiking	or it's only for matrix?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I believe it should
 lisitsyn	but I haven't seen the code
 lisitsyn	wiking: are you talking about dynamic array?
@wiking	ArrayXXd
@wiking	Array<double,Dynamic,Dynamic>
 lisitsyn	oh I think it should be just the same thing as matrix

@HeikoS	wiking: jo!
@wiking	sup
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	wiking: saw the entrance task with the irc logs?
@wiking	ye
@wiking	i'll try to archive it
@wiking	and put it somehwere
@wiking	like dropbox or whatever
@HeikoS	is there still a link for the old logs?
@wiking	but not likely to happen
@wiking	in the next 3 days
@wiking	we have the logs
@wiking	its' being logged all the time
@wiking	just the link is broken
@HeikoS	I was just wondering whether there is still a working link
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	okok
@HeikoS	Ill comment
@HeikoS	wiking: btw there is already a very applications in the gsoc program site
@wiking	mm is there?
@wiking	lemme check
@wiking	mmm why spreadsheet? :D
@HeikoS	no idea :D
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	please dont let anybody
@wiking	try to touch
@wiking	input hadnling
@wiking	that's way complicated work
@HeikoS	okok
@wiking	there's so muhc other good stuff
@wiking	that could be done :)
@wiking	like the immutable features
@wiking	mm
@wiking	HeikoS, isnt' there column iterator of an eigen matrix/array?
@HeikoS	wiking: agreed
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont know
@wiking	:<
@HeikoS	we should have iterators for our features
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	and kernels
@wiking	we've talked about htat
@HeikoS	and then
@wiking	with lambday|work
@wiking	we'll have
@wiking	i'm working on the input shit
@HeikoS	inside it, it does proper memory traversing
@wiking	i'm throwing out
@wiking	StreamingInput
@HeikoS	like "features->iterate_over_all"
@wiking	we gonna have just
@HeikoS	kernel_matrix->iterate_over_all
@wiking	inputstream
@wiking	that has iterators
@wiking	and fuck it
@HeikoS	and then kernel matrix is stored only symmetric bits
@HeikoS	but still traverses ast
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah agreed
@wiking	and either you read it one by one
@wiking	or do a full iteration
@wiking	and store it in mem
@wiking	i dont care
@wiking	but this that we have
@wiking	StreamingAsciiFile
@wiking	it's a bs
@wiking	we should have
@wiking	[CSV, LibSVM...]InputRecord
@wiking	and all should be iterable
@wiking	and yeah same with fatures
@wiking	*features
@HeikoS	yes yes yes
@HeikoS	thats detox project material
@wiking	as well as immutable
@HeikoS	if we draft this a bit we can give it to student
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	we just need drafts that are detailed enough so they can implement it
@HeikoS	i look forward to that actually
@wiking	eigen
@wiking	why u no has iterator
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	no idea
@wiking	ah fcuk
@wiking	i haven't checked our cloud
@wiking	is that owrking?
@wiking	ok ppl are logged in
@wiking	for 3 days now
@wiking	:)
@wiking	seems the latest fix did it's job
@wiking	mmm should write an article about it
@wiking	but first we would need a release
@HeikoS	joana in my lab was using the cloud and some regression notebooks for her research!
@HeikoS	wiking: lambday|work you think iterators for features can be entrance tasks=?
@wiking	HeikoS, no )
@HeikoS	kk

@wiking	HeikoS, have u seen that ever that if you iterate through a matrix
@wiking	and do some operate over and over it's columns
@wiking	if you write back to the same matrix
@wiking	things are not the same
@HeikoS	nope
@wiking	as if you just write it back to a different matrix
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	not sure I follow
@wiking	yeah i'm writing a code
@wiking	for eigne people as well :)
@HeikoS	i see
@HeikoS	still not following :D
