@wiking	ookeeey
@wiking	we have docker image for shogun
@wiking	https://index.docker.io/u/vigsterkr/shogun/
@wiking	but this is a simple shogun image
@wiking	i'll make soon the python modular image as well
@HeikoS	whooo :)
@sonney2k	wiking, nice :)
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@c-67-180-92-246.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@wiking	just try this
@wiking	sudo docker pull vigsterkr/shogun
@wiking	and i thought that this only distributes the Dockerfile, i.e. how to create the image...
@wiking	but not
@wiking	it is actually distributing the fs
@wiking	so the binaries...
@wiking	let's hope today we get the fedora stuff and that it runs the latest open stack
@wiking	because then we can play with the new docker images :P
@wiking	i'll have to keep updating both of the images...
@wiking	i suppose it'll be done by a nightly script
@wiking	;)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix hdf5 / ascii pickle deserialization
@wiking	besser82: ping
 besser82	wiking: pong  :D
@wiking	besser82: any news?
 besser82	wiking: storage for cloud-appliance is nearly finshed  ;)
@wiking	meaning? :)
@wiking	or ETA?
@sonney2k	wiking, well rather one per *final* release :)
@sonney2k	wiking, except for the demos we are in release shape now
@sonney2k	wiking, if you can do anything about matlab / the usr/local install'd issue that would be good
 besser82	wiking: just need to format and mount the storage....
 besser82	wiking: any preference?  Filesystem? Mountpoint?
@wiking	sonney2k: well i though to have shogun:latest (that is following the develop repo)
@wiking	sonney2k: and i thought like shogun:<release version>
@wiking	so people can choose ;P
@wiking	sonney2k: docker supports tagging... so that's a good thing ;)
@wiking	besser82: simple ext4 should be fine
@wiking	besser82: or is this a ramfs?
 besser82	wiking: but running version of openStack, doesn't yet  :(
 besser82	wiking: no, real hdd storage
@wiking	besser82: ah then simple ext4 should be fine
@wiking	and just mount it for /mnt
@wiking	besser82: you mean the running version of openstack doesn't support docker?
@wiking	besser82: it's not that big a deal...
 besser82	wiking: ahh, ok  :)
 besser82	wiking: are you sure with mounting in /mnt?
@wiking	besser82: can u copy paste `uname -a` ?
@wiking	besser82: where else?
 besser82	wiking: I'd propose /srv/$somewhat
@wiking	besser82: fine...
 besser82	wiking: by meanings of SElinux contexts that would be safer
@wiking	it's good for me basically
@wiking	anything would be fine ;)
@wiking	just let's have it running already
 besser82	wiking: kernel on the machine is 3.11.X
@wiking	besser82: ah ok then we can haz docker by our own
@wiking	;)
@wiking	it needs 3.8
@wiking	but just put it together and let's see if we can ssh ;
@wiking	:P
 besser82	wiking: 3.8 is old-school by fedora means  :-P
 besser82	wiking: no even in officail repos anymore for F18+  ;)
 besser82	wiking: so, I'll setup c-a after my next coffee && cig
 besser82	sonney2k: I'm on that problems with cmake, but unfortunately some stuff is _really_ problematic, e.g. correctly building the SWIG'ed java-bindings
@wiking	besser82: why is that a problem?
 besser82	sonney2k: Actually it fails for me by any meanings
 besser82	wiking: ^^^
@wiking	why?
@wiking	i mean it worksforme status now :P
@wiking	so that's why i wonder what's your issue with java modular
 besser82	wiking: at first javac complains about not finding ....*.java
 besser82	wiking: got that fixed then
 besser82	wiking: then it fails on building Loader.class
@wiking	besser82: u r talking now about your new cmake scripts or with current cmake files?
 besser82	wiking: no package org.shogun...
 besser82	wiking: current
@wiking	besser82: and which java r u trying to use
 besser82	wiking: openJDK 1.7.0
@wiking	oracle java or some opejdk
@wiking	aaah
@wiking	well i guess you have your answer ;)
 besser82	wiking: WTF?!?
@wiking	yeps
 besser82	wiking: Who used the oracle sh*t?
@wiking	openjdk is really not the best shit for java
@wiking	well everybody who uses java
@wiking	i mean openjdk is a nice dream
@wiking	but it's really bad
@wiking	regardless of shogun

 besser82	wiking: even hadoop, mesos && mahout are running fine with it
@wiking	besser82: i had problem both with mahout and solr
 besser82	wiking: no, problems here on the redhat/fedora-front  ;)
@wiking	besser82: that's unrelated of the distro
 besser82	wiking: I know, but we actually got it working  ;)
 besser82	wiking: by no means ready for production, but it runs...
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: but if you wouldn't mind, I can get some folks from the fedora-java-sig to make it running  ;)

@iglesiasg	wiking, hey! I just read the mail. It sounds pretty awesome. I will spend some time with it during the weekend
@iglesiasg	looking forward to it
@wiking	iglesiasg: it's pretty cool
@wiking	no need for compilation
@wiking	nada
@wiking	just get the docker binary working and then it's running out of box
@wiking	and it's really cool that they provide a repository for sharing images ;P
@iglesiasg	nada haha
@wiking	iglesiasg: we'll use this for the cloud arch
@wiking	as this is a pretty good way of jailing an ipython notebook server
@wiking	for each ipython session a new docker container will fired up
@wiking	and then basically when the session is over the container is destroyed ;P
@wiking	the good thing is that this doesn't involve any VM stuff... i.e. it runs natively on the system
@wiking	of course there's no native client for it atm on OSX
@wiking	but for that they prepared a vagrant image
@wiking	;P
@iglesiasg	neat
@wiking	but you should be able to have it on archlinux
@wiking	only thing is that u have to take care of the right kernel settings

 parijat_	thanks @thoralf. Just to make sure recompile everything means to run cmake and then make in the root directory (ie shogun-develop) right?)
 thoralf	parijat_: Yes.  "make -j<#processes> (all|shogun-unit-test|unit-tests|install)"
 parijat_	ok thanks. let me try.
-!- parijat_ [~parijat@223.184.194.14] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@wiking	thoralf: doh?
@wiking	thoralf: i mean it's chrooted
@wiking	thoralf: so it's not that big of a deal
 thoralf	wiking: That's true, but if I'm trying to play around on a system on which I'm not sudoer?
@wiking	thoralf: aaah wait... you are now talking about docker commands?
 thoralf	wiking: Sorry, missing context.  Yes. ;)
@wiking	thoralf: that's out of my scope... talk with docker developers
@wiking	why do u need sudo
@wiking	but imo it's all about the kernel apis it's using
@wiking	and that they are not available by default for simple users
@wiking	but then again i'm not sooo familiar with docker internals
@wiking	i'm just following the official docker documentation
@wiking	which uses sudo everywhere for docker
@wiking	if u wanna know more: /join #docker or write to mailing list
 thoralf	Thanks.
 thoralf	http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/basics/#why-sudo
 thoralf	Yeah. ;)
@wiking	there u go... it depends on your docker setup... but then again by default it shoudl be sudo... :P
@wiking	thoralf: "Just to make sure recompile everything means to run cmake and then make in the root directory (ie shogun-develop) right?)"
@wiking	that was actually wrong...
@wiking	not in the root but in the build...
 thoralf	root directory (ie shogun-develop) <-- I thought shogun-develop is his build dir.
 thoralf	Not clear.
 thoralf	Hmm.
 thoralf	Btw. rebuilding everything shouldn't be neccessary any more, right?
@wiking	hehe yeh i hope so :D

@sonney2k	alright guys
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, wiking, lisitsyn, thoralf besser82 - release sprint!
@iglesiasg	let's do it
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: good catch I am more or less available
 lisitsyn	though have a bus in 2 hrs
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: how can we make that notebook
 lisitsyn	:D
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@50.7.50.60] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, do you have any idea about it written down so far?
 lisitsyn	no I was a bit stucked
@wiking	besser82: ping ping ping
@sonney2k	heiko is writing long blog posts currently
@sonney2k	buildbots are all green
@sonney2k	and I will do demos
@wiking	sonney2k: no they are not
@wiking	sonney2k: there's at least one major concurency error
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: lets join some google doc then
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, sure
@sonney2k	wiking, well next release we can do better then
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I have time to work on this this evening after dinner and during the weekend
@wiking	sonney2k: you can run the demos in docker image
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: uhmm I guess sonney2k wants it asap :D
@sonney2k	wiking, well they are running already but we can switch later
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: when is your dinner?
@wiking	sonney2k: where r they running atm?
@sonney2k	wiking, fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org/regression/svr
@sonney2k	etc
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, long to come still
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, like in about 4-5 hours
@wiking	ok so fatbot
 lisitsyn	hah
@sonney2k	so if you see sth to polish please do it
@sonney2k	I mean documentation
@sonney2k	READMEs
 lisitsyn	okay I'll start and pass it over to you
@sonney2k	website
@wiking	sonney2k: there's heaps of issues still..
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, sounds good!
@sonney2k	wiking, which?
@wiking	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?milestone=3&state=open
@wiking	first 4 could be closed by 1 fix
@sonney2k	wiking, well we won't have workshop videos
@sonney2k	so what lets move them to 3.1
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I think I want to cover just 5 methods
@wiking	sonney2k: what's the sudden rush?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, we can get the theory from tapkee's website
@sonney2k	nothing release critical
 lisitsyn	yes iglesiasg
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: agree, these data races are not major
@wiking	sonney2k: we have a thread sync error, and that's not critical?
@sonney2k	wiking, no
@wiking	who's a data race not critical?
@sonney2k	it is just one bug among many
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so probably there is not much cost including many methods
 lisitsyn	wiking: I think it is not
@wiking	lisitsyn: and how is it not a critical?
@wiking	:D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so we could present a couple of figures with embeddings
@sonney2k	and it is 'minor'
 lisitsyn	wiking: no I get your message but we have other bugs as well
 lisitsyn	we won't release any day if we approach to fix everything
 lisitsyn	just lower your threshold ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: not eveyrthing we've moved quite some stuff already to 3.1
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, any idea how could we compare the results of different methods applied to the same data set?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: not yet
@sonney2k	wiking, if you have time fix as much as you can and then we will release with that
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, maybe for some labelled data set we apply knn in the original space
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, and then the same using the data after dim red
@sonney2k	wiking, we just have to release *very soon* or we will never
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, and we make a table or a bar plot of classification accuracy using different dimred methods and that's pretty much it. What do you think?
@wiking	sonney2k: ok then at least give this weekend
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: sounds good but no idea what the outcome would look like
@iglesiasg	haha me neither
@sonney2k	wiking, we will prepare everything today - if you can fix (the critical cmake erros) ws videos - that is much more important than some function crashing sometimes

@iglesiasg	oh
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so release today?!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am on the plane with heiko today so we try to get everything blog / release post like in shape
@wiking	sonney2k: can we have the release on monday?
@iglesiasg	ok
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and I will write some shell script to do the release tgz
@sonney2k	wiking, what exactly do you still want to do / fix?
@sonney2k	wiking, cmake with matlab? cmake with /usr/local/* or ws videos?
@wiking	and other static interfaces
@wiking	yes
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean why delay? these issues are open for months
@wiking	sonney2k: yeas
@wiking	but this weekend i have time
@wiking	unlike other weekends...
@wiking	i mean i'm not fulltime working on shogun (not like during summer)
@sonney2k	wiking, ok then we will prepare everything then so we just have to push a button
@sonney2k	wiking, fix what you can / want to
@sonney2k	wiking, but we *will* release monday latest
@wiking	ok monday 12:00 UTC
 lisitsyn	monday would be better for me cause I can prepare better notebook
@wiking	i'll have things ready by sunday night
@wiking	or at least as much as i can

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what's up
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I haven't managed to write anything interesting yet :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, no problem. I was thinking about starting an script to check this knn after dim red idea
 lisitsyn	oh would be nice!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, are you ok with it?
@iglesiasg	cool
 lisitsyn	yes totally
@iglesiasg	any idea for the data set to use?
@iglesiasg	if not, I will take this portion of MNIST I used for the LMNN notebook
@iglesiasg	or I could go with the metagenomics data set
@iglesiasg	sort of high dimensional, so it can be interesting in this case
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah metagenomics one sounds more interesting
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, 85 examples with 1472 features, 3 classes
 lisitsyn	good!
@iglesiasg	http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6576096
@iglesiasg	there is the result applying td-sne
