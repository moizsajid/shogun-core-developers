 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: hey
 blackburn	wiking: ha! I bet these slep leaks blocks you from sleeping :)
 wiking	blackburn: hhehehe no not really just dont want to start with other latent stuff
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	thanks, I merged that
 wiking	so i've started up fixing the static analyzer stuff
 shogun-buildbot	build #545 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test lua_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/545  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	heheh wazntme :)
 blackburn	wiking: yes, I didn't manage to fix up lua yet
 shogun-buildbot	build #546 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test lua_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/546  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 sonne|work	blackburn: the build braker is in da hous
 sonne|work	e
 blackburn	sonne|work: lua is undebuggable
 sonne|work	I see
 sonne|work	This thing sporadically pops up on the bb
 sonne|work	but never locally...
 blackburn	sonne|work: no, it actually hangs on my machine
 sonne|work	but then valrind / gdb and voila!
 blackburn	sonne|work: I've got recursive calls of typemaps
 blackburn	neither gdb nor valgrind pukes :D
 blackburn	it is just eats all my 8gb of memory and dies
 blackburn	it just*
 sonne|work	well ok then check the typemaps :)
 blackburn	yeah I did (twice!!!!!) :)
 blackburn	well, I'll get back to that soon

 blackburn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading
 heiko	blackburn, wiking, I solved all problems in another way :)
 heiko	blackburn, no streaming kernel needed, I just extended streaming features and use normal kernel
 heiko	wiking, I have removed this method I mentioned. Its possible to let the caller decide at another point in the code
 shogun-buildbot	build #438 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/438  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 heiko	dont worry buildbot, the last build of the 50 works :)
 blackburn	heiko: it doesn't, lua is still broken :)
 heiko	blackburn, lol :)

 wiking	heiko: :)
 heiko	this streaming two-sample test is really cool now: 500 millions samples and more
 heiko	gotta go, see you later guys
 blackburn	500 millions??
 blackburn	how?
 heiko	blackburn, yeah :)
 blackburn	why? :D
 heiko	well streaming
 heiko	some problems are so hard that they need this many samples
 blackburn	how does that work?
 blackburn	I thought you create NxN matrix
 heiko	streaming data, so does not have to be stored in mem
 heiko	no
 blackburn	2 examples by step?
 heiko	just need trace of kernel matrix
 blackburn	2x2?
 blackburn	ah
 heiko	kind of yeah
 blackburn	interesting
 blackburn	remarkable thing to mention
 blackburn	like
 blackburn	hey guys we are working with data with 500 millions examples
 blackburn	what's up with your dlib/scikits/weka?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	indeed, thats what I did in my thesis ;)
 heiko	more interesting is: there are problems that *need* that much data
 heiko	otherwise you cannot solve them since they are too hard
 blackburn	what is the problem?
 wiking	lol
 heiko	http://herrstrathmann.de/images/blobs.png
 blackburn	that's like such a big data one can estimate probability distribution pretty precisely
 heiko	to distinguish between the red and the blue
 blackburn	is that possible?
 heiko	(with other parameters than in the image, but thats the principle)
 wiking	heiko: and what machine do u use with the kernel?
 heiko	CLinearTimeMMD, its not a machine
 heiko	statistical test
 wiking	ah yeah
 heiko	but I mean two-sample testing and binary classification is similar
 heiko	nature
 blackburn	so H0 is like blue
 blackburn	and H1 is red
 blackburn	?
 wiking	heiko: so u reckon it should work with a binary machine as well?
 wiking	*binary classifier...
 heiko	blackburn, yes
 heiko	no
 heiko	ehm, no
 heiko	H0: p=q
 heiko	H1: p!=q
 heiko	where p is read and q is blue
 heiko	wiking, well I dont know a machine that can handle that much data
 heiko	we have online lib-linear right?
 wiking	heiko: apart from online
 wiking	or like pegasus-svm
 heiko	ah ok
 wiking	so yeah it would only work with that ...
 heiko	year, easily classifiable data is also easy to distinguish in a two-sample test
 heiko	the dataset is quite interesting
 heiko	since the differences are hidden inside, at a different scalling that the overall data has
 blackburn	heiko: so we only say it is the same distribution or it is not
 heiko	blackburn, yes, but one tries to find a difference, that is "pull the distributions apart", so quite similar to classification
 heiko	when you can pull them apart, you can put a hyperplane in between
 blackburn	I see
 heiko	I gotta go now, see you later :)
 wiking	laterz

 blackburn	wiking: great
 wiking	blackburn: yep in the meanwhile i even invented a new way of training the latent so-svm ;)
 wiking	to have a better convergence
 blackburn	without a train set?
 wiking	i have a train set
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	bad
 blackburn	I'd like a method without train set
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	nocando
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: wanna try to beat guys on digit recognition? http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
 blackburn	kind of test

 wiking	blackburn: kagggle and no prize? :)
 blackburn	wiking: I do not expect any prize to receive without experience..
 blackburn	btw
 blackburn	check that
 blackburn	https://gist.github.com/3789950
 wiking	what's the time? :)
 blackburn	looks like useful thing for ml, I am now thinking about a way to register local context variables and save them
 blackburn	time.time?
 blackburn	well, time
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	with thing looks like pretty compact way to designate scopes where you need to save something or measure
 wiking	http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/
 wiking	hehe
 blackburn	tl;dr
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	oops :D
