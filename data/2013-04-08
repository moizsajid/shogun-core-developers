 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah!
 n4nd0	let's keep ourselves crossed
 n4nd0	not just our fingers
 blackburn	I am not that flexible!
 sonne|work	I hope that doesn't affect # toilet visits
 sonne|work	blackburn: Any idea how one can modify the registration form for the workshop?
 sonne|work	more specifically
 sonne|work	the choices ml expert / bloody beginner
 sonne|work	etc
 blackburn	sonne|work: what do you mean?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	Form - Edit form
 blackburn	as usual
 sonne|work	ahh ok - because I have a parse error for Acknowledged with some concepts of machine learning
 sonne|work	I guess - this means machine learning expert?
 sonne|work	^ blackburn or what?

 blackburn	no you have learnt the basics of runglish
 blackburn	otherwise you weren't able to understand my alphanumerical sequencies
 sonne|work	blackburn: must be due to the roots of these languages being ENGLISH!
 blackburn	sonne|work: no my language origins from mongolian warriors!

 n4nd0	wow
 n4nd0	good news indeed
 n4nd0	yeah the page was loading while I asked :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please twitter about it and blog about it!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am changing the website
 n4nd0	sonney2k: updating the we are planning to participate to we are participating or sth else?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, add another message - we are proud to be part of GSoC 2013!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but I meant your own blog :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure, I am on it
 n4nd0	I am writting in shogun's twitter, then blog, then g+
 n4nd0	my browser is only charging 25 accepted orgs and shogun is among them, we must be really important :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, http://shogun-toolbox.org/
@sonney2k	updated :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, please write some announcement on the mailinglist...
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
 anthrax512	Hi to all, I'm looking for a mentor to GSoC
@sonney2k	anthrax512, then tell us what you want to do and we will find you someone...

 blackburn	haha oh my god that's fast
-!- jayrambhia [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 anthrax512	my main skill is Python, so I can do the "Develop interactive machine learning demos" and "mloss.org and mldata.org integration" tasks
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is a reason for that - currently only ~20 accepted orgs are shown
@sonney2k	simply because they haven't all submitted their profile page yet
@sonney2k	so we appear on the top
 blackburn	sonney2k: >30 already
 blackburn	42
 n4nd0	aah the profile thing
@sonney2k	anthrax512, then I would suggest you start to familiarize with shogun and read the task description and start doing some simple stuff already
@sonney2k	blackburn, 20 minutes back it was ~10
@sonney2k	blackburn, once you have sent the email have a look at what I've written for shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, maybe you have some ideas how to improve...
 blackburn	sonney2k: written wherE?
@sonney2k	blackburn, didn't you get the acceptance email?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I did
@sonney2k	the first link
 anthrax512	@sonney2k, and then I should show some results in the end of april, and you'll make your decision, right?
 blackburn	sonney2k:  You need to be a organization administrator for Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox to access this page.
@sonney2k	blackburn, well log in with your *new* shogun thingy
@sonney2k	not with your old student account
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah probably that's the reason
@sonney2k	blackburn, if that doesn't work I will ask at #gsoc
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think you need to add me there somehow
 blackburn	sonney2k: when I open 'my connections' I see nothing
@sonney2k	anthrax512, it usually works like this: students check out what they are interested in and already now familiarize with the task and start contributing(!). Then you write a proposal and then it will be ranked by all mentors.
@sonney2k	blackburn, I also have no connections
@sonney2k	blackburn, but do you see shogun?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see only application
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes then please open the link in the email
@sonney2k	the first one
 blackburn	The organization with the ID shogun already exists and hence you cannot create a new organization profile for the same ID. If you are actually looking for editing this organization profile please click here.
 blackburn	You need to be a organization administrator for Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox to access this page.

@sonney2k	blackburn, link id
@sonney2k	yes username
@sonney2k	(maybe)
 blackburn	sonney2k: sergey_lisitsyn
@sonney2k	blackburn, I asked carols
@sonney2k	btw 177 organizations in
@sonney2k	blackburn, carols said I should ask in melange
@sonney2k	#melange
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you use that username in last years too?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I didn't change anything
@sonney2k	too bad
@sonney2k	then that certainly is the problem
@sonney2k	hmmhh I am getting email from students already...
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh you will get a lot
 blackburn	due to simplicity of some tasks
@sonney2k	random forests...
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh..
@sonney2k	looks like it will take the melange guys some time
 blackburn	sonney2k: is that a problem? we can wait a little, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well announce the thing nevertheless - you can do edits later if you are not happy
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is what I wrote
@sonney2k	https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am quite ok with it
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 I also updated http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw chris jsut told me he won't be at the workshop :/
 n4nd0	good
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you receive anything from the big boss?
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	I meant good for the update, not for Chris news :S
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh bad I won't met him
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what about changing planning to partipate to partipating http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013
 blackburn	n4nd0: sure please change ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me fix my computer first please :S
 n4nd0	I am even scared
 n4nd0	idk what the hell I have done
 blackburn	n4nd0: ahh yeah sure
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no add a new news item
@sonney2k	saying that we are in
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok

@sonney2k	blackburn, can you finally access the page?
 bogdanc	hi! I would be interested in participating in GSOC working on a shogun project, but I do not have any ML knowleadge now. Though, I am willing to learn about it. Do you think that is it possible for me to solve one task in this condition?
-!- rishabh [~rishabh@115.249.18.25] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]

 naywhayare	hello there.  long-time lurker and maintainer of another ML library that got accepted into GSoC here.  quick question: how many applications am I going to end up with?  1/10/100/1000/10 billion?
 blackburn	naywhayare: hah congrats!
 naywhayare	I've not done GSoC before so I have no idea what to expect.  any help is appreciated :)
 blackburn	naywhayare: yeah about 10-12 billion
 blackburn	;)
 naywhayare	really?  I wouldn't be too surprised.  I'm trying to figure out what level of filtering I'll need to be doing
 blackburn	naywhayare: we received a bit more than 100 last  year I think
 bogdanc	so I have no real chance with a task involving ML?
@sonney2k	blackburn, IIRC 50-60
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh my mistake
 naywhayare	oh wow, okay.  our humble little outfit surely can't handle any more than 10 (I suspect my other "mentors" are in it for the free t-shirts)
 blackburn	naywhayare: what is your org?
 blackburn	bogdanc: there is always a chance
 naywhayare	blackburn: mlpack
 blackburn	naywhayare: nice website!
 blackburn	:)
 naywhayare	I need to polish up the application page quite a lot (judging by the other pages I've looked at) but I got something up there "just for now"
 naywhayare	thanks.  I wanted to keep it super-minimal, but in some respects it's *too* minimal
 bogdanc	I know that there is a chance, but I don't want to set targets I can't reach. that's why I asked you who have much more experience in the field
@sonney2k	naywhayare, it's like windows 8 isn't it :D
-!- deerishi [73f88294@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	naywhayare, since you are in too - maybe we can have some synergies
 naywhayare	haha.  "looks great on mobile devices"
 blackburn	bogdanc: well ML is not that hard
@sonney2k	naywhayare, at least with say being able to read your / our data formats or exchanging simple models
 naywhayare	sonney2k: if you have any ideas, I'd be glad to work together.  in some aspects shogun and mlpack are orthogonal
 n4nd0	bogdanc: Sure. Take a look to the ideas page and see what would be suitable for you. For example I think you don't need to be a ML guru for the demos project http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas#demos
 naywhayare	ah, now there is a good idea.  we haven't settled on a saved model format completely yet (rudimentary efforts are xml)
 n4nd0	bogdanc: and it may be a good fit to starting learning about it.
 naywhayare	most of the tasks mlpack does are one-time-use models so there's not much use saving a model
 blackburn	naywhayare: I also have a template C++ library on dimension reduction if you are interested :)
 naywhayare	can you point me towards it?  I'd be interested in poking at it
 blackburn	naywhayare: https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee
 naywhayare	just wish I had more time to really look into all the things I wanted to :-S
 blackburn	naywhayare: it is the core of dimension reduction in shogun
 deerishi	any suggestions on projects involving ICA/BSS and signal procesing?
 blackburn	deerishi: suggestions like?
 naywhayare	ah, it has the ridiculously ugly john langford cover tree code
 blackburn	naywhayare: it works.. :)
 naywhayare	it does, but it ain't pretty :)
 n4nd0	deerishi: There is actually a project idea on ICA and BSS :) Not sure if you meant that.
 deerishi	i meant that
 deerishi	:)
 n4nd0	deerishi: aham! All right.
 blackburn	naywhayare: I have had a bad experience with 'prettier' covertree https://github.com/DNCrane/Cover-Tree
@sonney2k	pretty != working != fast
 blackburn	sonney2k: my other code is much prettier and working and fast ;)
 n4nd0	deerishi: mmm so regarding ICA, I know there is some open source implementations of ICA strategies (in sklearn for example). You could check them out and try to get something into Shogun as an initial patch.
 naywhayare	my thought has been that a lot of the stuff jl did, while perhaps faster, is only incrementally (i.e. 1-3%) faster than a much prettier counterpart
 naywhayare	the fact that it's not documented at all is also a big problem.  it took me forever to realize what he was doing with the empty lists to avoid mallocs
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is also interesting https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/pagmo
 n4nd0	blackburn, naywhayare, sonney2k : why do people dislike JL implementations? :)))
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't
 blackburn	n4nd0: because they are .. let me cite naywhayare .. 'ridiculiously ugly'
 n4nd0	hehe
 naywhayare	n4nd0: 'cause they don't implement what's in the paper, they're ugly, undocumented, unmaintained, and not particularly usable in other settings
 naywhayare	also not generalized at all and specific to only one task
 naywhayare	...I have *particularly* strong opinions about jl code

 n4nd0	naywhayare: hehe I agree with you in that it is rather hard to go through
 naywhayare	the funniest part is that in my experience, I have yet to find a dataset where cover trees perform faster than well-written kd trees (the construction cost is usually huge)
 blackburn	I have to second that guys
@sonney2k	naywhayare, heh - I guess the same I have about TJs code (joachims...)
 naywhayare	curiously the cover tree paper did not include comparisons with kd-trees.
 bogdanc	I have noticed that one too as being an easier one. but how about something under machine learning tasks?

 blackburn	it is a metric tree

 blackburn	naywhayare: as I needed something that works with arbitrary distance/kernel it was very important for me
 naywhayare	this is true
 naywhayare	although in that case I do suspect ball trees would still be faster than cover trees
 naywhayare	but I haven't thoroughly taken a look
 blackburn	naywhayare: yeah I just didn't get proper ball tree code yet
 blackburn	:)
 bogdanc	so with enough time and energy invested, it is faisable for a beginner to solve one of those, right?

 blackburn	sonney2k: yes sure
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn : what do you think are the project priorities this year?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, gsoc wise you mean?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: world domination as usual
@sonney2k	in general it IMHO it really is accessibility
@sonney2k	and that :D
 n4nd0	hehe
 medeeiip	hello everyone I'm new to this project and want to build shogun on windows. I can see a cmakeList in /src but it is creating a sln file with a project only with the cpp files. How can I get also the .h files inside the project?
 n4nd0	mmm I think we have an errata in the ideas list
@sonney2k	n4nd0, now that we have proper infrastructure we should be able to generate some nice applications / doc :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, not so unlikely...
@sonney2k	medeeiip, shogun & windows is tough - cygwin is the only thing I ever got to work
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the second project in accesibility list. We removed from index but not from descriptions
 n4nd0	medeeiip: Unfortunately cmake integration in shogun is far from complete. I believe someone started sth, but nothing else.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, indeed this format reading stuff is covered in fas reading and writing shogun features
 blackburn	naywhayare: so let me know if you would like to integrate my stuff - I will assist all the things if so
 medeeiip	If I create a new cmakelist is it possible ? I mean to say is there any more additional dependency?
@sonney2k	medeeiip, if you get it to work we would be most happy to use it!
@sonney2k	medeeiip, and merge your patch
 n4nd0	sonney2k: let's take it out then. Are you editing or should I?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please do
@sonney2k	medeeiip, well there are a couple but there are no hard dependencies in shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: you are not changing anything in ideas either,are you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no I do not change anything
 naywhayare	blackburn: I'll take a look, but I have a ton on my plate.  I'll probably have a chance to look into it in a couple weeks
 blackburn	naywhayare: yes sure - just let me know if you (would like) and we will discuss it then

 naywhayare	blackburn: one interesting thing to think about for DR may be this:
 naywhayare	some DR methods like MVU are based on semidefinite programs (SDPs)
 naywhayare	about ten years ago there was some work by Monteiro and Burer which reformulated SDPs as low-rank SDPs
 blackburn	naywhayare: yeah may be I'll allocate a gsoc task for that as I lack MVU
 naywhayare	which are not convex like SDPs, so you don't get to use all the nice convex optimization theory, but in practice they run faster (i.e. O(N^2 log N) not O(N^3)) and give solutions nearly as good
 naywhayare	so applying LRSDPs to MVU has reportedly been done by my "predecessor" (Vasiloglou... the paper is out there somewhere)
 naywhayare	but I haven't ever managed to reproduce the results though I have tried quite extensively
 blackburn	good to know, thanks naywhayare
 naywhayare	a working LRSDP implementation applied to Weinberger's usual 'formulate-it-as-an-SDP' works (and other people who do the same) could provide some really good speedup for that
 naywhayare	I have a working LRSDP implementation in mlpack (at least, it passes the simple tests) but I could never get it to work for any ML task
 naywhayare	anyway, perhaps approaching it again from a fresh start would yield better results
