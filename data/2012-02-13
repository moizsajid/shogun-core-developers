 blackburn	wiking: im still waiting for JS kernel results :D
 wiking	blackburn: no fucking way
 blackburn	it is TOO slow :)
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	in the meanwhile i've got some new kernels coming up
 wiking	we'll see about their results
 blackburn	really? which one?
 blackburn	ones*
 wiking	but yeah a little bit of parallel loop there in the compute function would do some good
 wiking	some generalization of js-kernel, like jensen-renyi kernel
 blackburn	I'm going to merge vlfeat things
 wiking	into shogun?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	great! :>
 wiking	homokernelmap?
 blackburn	yeah I'm thinking about it
 blackburn	well maybe just provide some adapter to vlfeat's code
 wiking	that'd be great
 wiking	the homo kernel map is only one .c code in the vlfeat proj
 wiking	so could be easily copied i think
 wiking	and the code is BSD licensed
 wiking	so no worries there
 wiking	just wrap a c++ class around it and that's it i think
 blackburn	yeah I'm going to do it once I get some vodka
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	and maybe some stuff you'll need from vl/mathop.h
 wiking	[master vl] $ wc -l homkermap.c                                                                                                                       [wiking@welitron:~/vlfeat/vl]
 wiking	     501 homkermap.c
 wiking	so 501 lines of code+comment
 blackburn	hmmm
 blackburn	looks like it is pretty simple
 wiking	but yeah make it nice so that the new JS derivative kernels i could implement fast as well within the homokernelmap
 wiking	as all the kernels i've checked now is positive definite
 wiking	and summing kernel
 wiking	so i'm hoping to be able to produce the homo-kernel-map of it as well
 blackburn	for some strange reasone first word of this map makes me smile now
 blackburn	would be funny to call it homogaykernelmap
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	is there any conceptual difference between JS and JR kernels?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	js is based on shannon entropy
 wiking	jr is renyi entropy
 wiking	and renyi entropy is a more generalized version of the classical version of (shannon) entropy in information theory
 wiking	anyhow i'll run some test before doing anything
 wiking	i'm just a bit sick now
 wiking	so everything is slower

 wiking	?
 blackburn	I just checked shogun gsoc idea text about lsvm :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: damn how to catch you
 blackburn	wiking: did you already implement a JR kernel?
 wiking	about to finish
 blackburn	nice

 wiking	blackburn: yeah that'd be cool to do it maybe this year
 wiking	as gsoc
 wiking	i mean l-ssvm
 blackburn	we should check if alex binder is available for mentoring
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	he's not coming around here ?
 blackburn	no, never seen him here
 wiking	mailing list i guess then
 wiking	blackburn: r u doing the homo-kernel-mapping stuff now?
 wiking	or should i dig myself into it ?
 blackburn	no, I'm on my job right now
 blackburn	hah feel free if you want
 wiking	heheh ok
 blackburn	wiking: I don't mind you doing anything ;)
 wiking	eheheheh i was just meaning that let's not do double work if possible :>>
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	can you accept a pull request?
 blackburn	while I'm working last year undergraduate I have not much time
 blackburn	yes, sure
 wiking	ok so should i do an official request or can u just pull this one in
 blackburn	[15:42] <wiking> eheheheh i was just meaning that let's not do double work if possible :>> ---- yeah, we shouldn't :)
 wiking	https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/commit/4d01e40b85aa928d9d49dfad9a2d4cba2a14504e
 wiking	it's a little bit of less operations this way
 blackburn	hmm sure
 wiking	you know 2 division vs 1 multiplication ;)
 wiking	so it should speed up things
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	not that much imho ;)
 blackburn	wiking: but I can't it from job, will be able to merge it a little later
 blackburn	do it*
 blackburn	can't do it*
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	no worries
 wiking	just don't forget
 wiking	;P
 blackburn	just make a pull request and I won't forget for sure
 wiking	ok so now i'm testing the new kernels :DDD
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	so let's see the thingy
 wiking	i guess it's gonna take some time now :P
 wiking	done
 blackburn	thanks
 wiking	nw
 blackburn	wiking: btw it is not a division/multiplication improvement
 wiking	it is
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	there are some ifs
 blackburn	so it couldn't be optimized
 wiking	??
 blackburn	I think gcc optimizes (1/const) things
 wiking	how? :)
 wiking	i mean a division is a division
 wiking	so if i do a/2 and b/2
 blackburn	at least with ffast-math
 wiking	how? :)
 blackburn	well now I'm sure
 blackburn	I'mnot
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	wiking: yeah there are some -unsafe-math-operations and etc
 blackburn	it enables to compute x*(1/y) instead of x/y
 blackburn	this case contained two 0.5* or /2 but now only one
 blackburn	that's what I meant
 wiking	:P
 wiking	it should be a bit faster now, but again it should be parallelized
 wiking	is there a reason not to have openmp in shogun?
 blackburn	no, feel free to openmp it
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	but you should safe it with #ifdef
 wiking	yeah sure
 wiking	that'll have to do some changes in the configure script as well
 blackburn	the problem is kernels are parallelized already
 wiking	anyhow then i'll do that meanwhile i'm doing the test
 wiking	in what sense?
 blackburn	e.g. one thread compute one row of kernel matrix
 blackburn	(if kernel matrix is being computed)
 wiking	i mean currently when i'm running training
 wiking	it only runs on one core
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	so i've figured that in this case the for loop could be sliced up between the number of cores
 wiking	and just do the calc in separate threads
 blackburn	IIRC Soeren doesn't mind openmping it as well as I
 blackburn	sure, makes sense for me too
 wiking	ok
 wiking	ok i'll then send the pull request when it's ready
 blackburn	wiking: I would suggest to do following:
 blackburn	introduce flag in Kernel.h
 blackburn	use_openmp
 blackburn	or so
 wiking	?
 wiking	why not an ifdef
 blackburn	and do two branches in each kernel
 wiking	that checks a macro
 wiking	that is set by the configure script
 blackburn	hmmm imagine you need to compute whole kernel matrix
 blackburn	then it is using 2 cores already
 blackburn	i.e. it runs compute() at the same time
 blackburn	for different rows
 blackburn	and if compute() wants two threads as well
 blackburn	it would be slower
 wiking	ah got it
 blackburn	so in computing kernel matrix things we could disable openmp if we are using multiple threads
 wiking	or of course
 blackburn	I think double parallelization could be bad
 wiking	you could even do better by setting the number of threads openmp allowed to use
 wiking	and then if you have like 8 cores...
 wiking	anyhow this is kind of the last thing i wanna test :)))
 wiking	more interested in other kernels
 blackburn	something like 2 for kernel matrix and 6 for openmp inside compute()?
 wiking	and maybe the homkernelmapping..
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	kinda complex thing..
 blackburn	no idea what would be best
 wiking	you can tell openmp how many threads it can use in it's threadpool
 blackburn	yeah I know
 blackburn	we have pretty dirty parallelization, should be cleaned indeed
 blackburn	I'm just not sure whether openmp can handle some complex cases
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	i'll try to do some test
 wiking	anyhow let's see the new kernel :)))
 blackburn	yeah I'm pretty curious
 wiking	me too
 wiking	but it's even worse
 wiking	computing time wise :P
 blackburn	what is the equation?
 wiking	exp (....)
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	worst kernel ever: exp(sin+cos+tg+arctg+exp(exp(exp))
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	explicitly mapping to infinite-dimensional space
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	mmm fuck
 wiking	i should test this with custom kernel
 blackburn	why?
 blackburn	wiking: btw are you still using java?
 wiking	well
 wiking	gotta
 wiking	by data set is kind of coming from mahout/hadoop
 wiking	and i don't want to now do data transcoding funcitons
 wiking	it's easier this way
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	I can't live without matplotlib :)
 wiking	btw: sum(a^q) * sum (b^q) = sum((a*b)^q)
 wiking	ah no
 wiking	that is for sure not true
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn	true for the most common case of d=1 :D

 n4nd0	blackburn, hi
 blackburn	hi there
 n4nd0	blackburn, about the ConjugateIndex class
 blackburn	yeah I'm curious whether this shit works or not
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have seen one example in the python modular interface using it but it cannot be imported
 blackburn	mmm do you have lapack?
 n4nd0	blackburn, I get an error from the interpreter, I didn't find it in the doc. either
 n4nd0	I don't think I have it because right now I don't even know what is it :P
 blackburn	remind LPBoost thing, there was an #ifdef HAVE_CPLEX
 blackburn	hmm you would have to install it :)
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: I can't recall which os do u use
 n4nd0	since I didn't find it in the doc I thought that  maybe the name had changed or sth
 blackburn	any ubuntu/debian?
 n4nd0	blackburn, ubuntu
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	then just install everything having name *lapack :)
 blackburn	and reconfigure
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw to save time you could also install
 blackburn	libsuperlu3
 blackburn	and libarpack
 blackburn	and libsuperlu3-dev
 blackburn	and libarpack-dev
 blackburn	that enables to achieve better performance while dim.reduction
 n4nd0	blackburn, thanks :)
 n4nd0	those will save me some configure and compilation times :D
 blackburn	no idea whether you would need or not, but you may try at least
 blackburn	you may also use --disable-optimizations flag
 blackburn	in configure
 blackburn	e.g. ./configure --disable-optimizations --interfaces=python_modular
 blackburn	and do make with -j2 or -j4 (number of threads)
 n4nd0	number of threads to parallelize the compilation?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	for example 'make -j4'
 n4nd0	the disable optimization sounds bad though ... isn't good to optimize :P?
 blackburn	n4nd0: but it would compile faster then
 blackburn	you may see no difference between 1.5s and 1.0s walltime :)
 n4nd0	it find the ConjugateIndex now :D
 blackburn	;sure
 wiking	WTF
 wiking	it's still counting
 wiking	:))))
 wiking	just training i mean
 wiking	yess! training done
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn, do you know about this error, it has appeared while training the ConjugateIndex
 n4nd0	ldc must be >= MAX(M,1): ldc=0 M=0Parameter 14 to routine cblas_dgemm was incorrect
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	I know what is the error
 blackburn	could you please change your labels from -1 and 1 to 0,1?
 blackburn	it is a bug
 n4nd0	sure, no problem ;)
 n4nd0	I have seen in the examples that they use -1 and 1 for two class problems
 n4nd0	is that the convention in shogun?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	but conjugateindex is general multiclass
 blackburn	so I just forgot to implement two 'modes'
 blackburn	binary and multiclass
 blackburn	for multiclass convention is 0,1,2,.. _without_ any gaps
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	it looks better now, it is taking some time for the training
 blackburn	yeah it is pretty expensive
 n4nd0	cool, it trained it, let's see what do I get
 n4nd0	I have to check a bit of this ConjugateIndex
 n4nd0	it is completely a black box for me right now
 blackburn	it computes matrix X^T (X^T X)^-1 X
 blackburn	for each class
 blackburn	X is a class feature matrix
 blackburn	then computes x^T (X^T (X^T X)^-1) X) x /<x,x>
 blackburn	and chooses nearest class for x
 blackburn	something like that
 blackburn	n4nd0: so how it was?
 blackburn	I bet it is bad :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, mmm I am trying to use the class to assess it AccuracyMeasure
 n4nd0	but I got an error because the labels in the ground truth are 0 or 1
 n4nd0	and it seems that it needs -1 and 1
 blackburn	use MulticlassAccuracy
 blackburn	accuracy measure is for -1, 1 and it compares signs of classes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I have tested the accuracy for the training set and it is 0.67
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	what was other results?
 blackburn	svm, knn?
 n4nd0	this the first one I try :)
 n4nd0	I am going to check a couple more now
 blackburn	ah okay
 n4nd0	but this is just using the intensity pixels, no feature
 blackburn	yes, conjugate thing was designed to cope with pixels
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	but acts badly anyway haha
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	with svm be sure you returned back to -1,1
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	what is the use of the cache for the kernels? I have seen this parameter size cache that the constructors have
 blackburn	to store some k(x_i,x_j) values
 blackburn	to avoid useless computations
-!- dfrx [~f-x@inet-hqmc02-o.oracle.com] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: for example when training svms it is very likely that kernels between some support vectors would be calculated many times
-!- dfrx [~f-x@inet-hqmc02-o.oracle.com] has left #shogun []
 n4nd0	blackburn, I got it ;-)
 n4nd0	blackburn, some kind of memorization like in DP
 blackburn	what is DP?
 n4nd0	dynamic programming
 n4nd0	blackburn, the accuracy with LibSVM is much more promising, 0.9987 (maybe a bit too hight??)
 n4nd0	blackburn, that is with the training set
 n4nd0	I have to split it anyway to get a test set
 blackburn	n4nd0: which kernel did you use?
 n4nd0	polynomial, degree 2
 blackburn	not really high, depends on C
 n4nd0	C = 1.0
 blackburn	it is ok for train set
 blackburn	try to split it :)
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	I have to go now
 n4nd0	see you later
 blackburn	ok, see you

 wiking	ok
 wiking	here's a new pull request
 wiking	;)
 wiking	damn how could i only select 1 commit for the pull request
 wiking	there's a bug in HIK
 blackburn	bug?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	nothing too serious
 wiking	but
 blackburn	tell me :)
 wiking	https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/commit/10d44a2bd4d497ec9ad4dd5b98be72afe9f52022
 wiking	check that
 blackburn	haha you scared me
 blackburn	wiking: just do it in one pull request
 wiking	can't
 wiking	i mean yeah
 blackburn	why not?
 wiking	what i could do is that take the optimization + this bug
 wiking	in one pull request
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	it is better to multiply entities ;)
 blackburn	occam restricted that
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	by the way
 wiking	do you know BoV?
 wiking	i guess so
 wiking	do you think that it would make a difference that instead a (squared)euclideandistance to use some kind of a different distance measure, like JSdistance? :)
 blackburn	I am afraid I don't
 blackburn	what is BoV?
 wiking	bag of visual words
 wiking	or bow
 wiking	or bovw
 blackburn	ah
 wiking	as you feel
 wiking	so when i'm doing the clustering
 wiking	e.g. k-means
 blackburn	I didn't really get into it :(
 wiking	the distance measure is dot product atm
 wiking	but i think that it's bs
 wiking	as those sift outputs
 wiking	are as well histograms
 wiking	not just some random values
 wiking	anyhnow
 wiking	i'm getting new results
 wiking	the JR currently sucks :P
 wiking	but we'll see with different arguments
 blackburn	hmm no idea about distance
 blackburn	I should dig into BoVW a little
 wiking	heheh well if u have any questions just shoot
 wiking	been digging in that shit for a while now :P
 blackburn	thanks!
 blackburn	wiking: what is a typical measure between sift descriptors?
 blackburn	distance or similarity or so
 blackburn	and how does it match points? :)
 blackburn	I believe answers are in papers, but anyway :)
 wiking	ah there are several way for matching sift descriptors
 wiking	although i'm not doing that at all :))
 blackburn	then how do you use any classifiers?
 wiking	well i'm using sift just to create visual words
 wiking	and then from visual words i create a visual words frequency vector
 wiking	and that's fed to the classifier
 blackburn	what is visual word in that meaning?
 wiking	well you get a lot of sift descriptors from a lot of images
 wiking	and then do an 'averaging' i.e. use a cluster algo
 wiking	to create visual words
 wiking	i.e. a codebook
 wiking	so that the clustering algorithm basically creates N number of clusters
 wiking	and u assigned each sift descriptor to the nearest cluster point
 blackburn	ok I found some presentation
 blackburn	example of word is eye on people photo
 blackburn	right?
 blackburn	oh it seems I'm getting into it
 blackburn	for new unclassified image
 blackburn	you compute sift descriptors
 blackburn	and assign every localized descriptor to nearest cluster
 blackburn	and then you have e.g. vector [#eyes #cars #bikes]
 blackburn	wiking: something like that?
 wiking	mmmnot really
 wiking	:)
 wiking	dman
 wiking	JR is still not good
 blackburn	ok what you are doing once you get descriptors?
 blackburn	assuming on train set you did clustering of various points of interest
 wiking	so when u've finished the clustering
 wiking	u basically assign each sift in an image to a cluster point (the nearest one)
 wiking	after this you count how many times a given cluster point is present within an image
 blackburn	each sift in an unclassified image?
 wiking	i.e. you'll get a term frequency
 blackburn	yeah I thought I said the same :)
 wiking	i.e. cluster centre frequency
 wiking	not really :P
 wiking	but yeah after you have this TF vector
 blackburn	what is the difference?
 wiking	you basically just take the labeling for that tf vector
 wiking	and learn by that the classifier
 blackburn	so feature vectors contains rates of various words?
 blackburn	I feel stupid :D
 blackburn	is a clustering a mandatory step?
 blackburn	I mean it could be 'misclustered' :)
 wiking	well
 wiking	the problem is that otherwise you have just too much different valued sift features
 wiking	so this is why you create a 'dictionary'
 wiking	with clustering
 blackburn	okay it looks clear now but I can't see my mistake
 blackburn	where I did go wrong?
 wiking	blackburn: and then you have e.g. vector [#eyes #cars #bikes]
 wiking	the clustered descriptors are not telling you anything about the label
 blackburn	[#rate for cluster 1, ... 2, ...]
 blackburn	right?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	so you would have something like
 blackburn	[0, 3, 5]?
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	car: [0,3,5]
 wiking	if you have a dictionary the size of 3, and this is a dense vector...
 blackburn	is there any weighting here?
 blackburn	could it be 1.243?
 wiking	well it depends more on your clustering method
 wiking	because you could use
 wiking	fuzzy clustering
 wiking	or even do some GMM shit
 wiking	so it really depends on your approach
 blackburn	hah I see
 blackburn	sounds like pretty instable, but working method
 wiking	well it works very well
 wiking	currently this gives you the best results
 blackburn	but it doesn't fit my task anyway :)
 wiking	like on a caltech101 benchmark dataset
 blackburn	wiking: ok thanks for your explanation
 wiking	nw
 blackburn	I'll merge your stuff once I get myself to home:)
 wiking	cool thnx
 wiking	maybe till then i get you a new/better kernel
 wiking	but then again it seems the one i thought would be good is not that good
 blackburn	I can't wait to see results with JS
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	heading to gym right now
 blackburn	sse ya

 wiking	well about this year
 wiking	if i want to do soemthing
 wiking	like the l-ssvm
 blackburn	you would have to wait when shogun is accepted (or not) :)
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	just that i have so much other stupid things to do
 wiking	in case it's accepted
 wiking	i want to have the whole thingy ready by then :P
 wiking	i mean proposition etc
 wiking	nyaah man
 wiking	the JR is shit
 wiking	:P
 wiking	but now i'm trying a new one
 wiking	JT :DD
 blackburn	man you totally hanged on J* things :)
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	because it's a great thingy
 wiking	i mean Jensen divergence
 wiking	it's really good in finding out the similarity between two probability distribution
