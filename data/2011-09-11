 blackburn	 Speicherzugriffsfehler
 blackburn	I guess it is something like PieceOfShitError?
 blackburn	:D

@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb1edffb / src/shogun/kernel/LocalAlignmentStringKernel.cpp : use CALLOC instead of MALLOC - http://git.io/Xo1Xag
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r73e9943 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/svm.py : use axis tight to improve figure - http://git.io/05RWKg
 blackburn	sonney2k: wow did you fix that?
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you already commit your fast LLE version?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, don't know
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've spent the whole day trying to get packing numbers work nicely, no success yet
 blackburn	now continued integrating superlu
@sonney2k	I don't know what packing numbers are
 blackburn	sonney2k: not important, just told you what is I'm working on :)

 blackburn	sonney2k: local alignment still failing
@sonney2k	blackburn, with which version did you compare last?
 blackburn	0.9.0
@sonney2k	I mean did it work in 0.8.sth?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't test it
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess it might be sufficient to do a git diff agains 0.8
 shogun-buildbot	build #13 of nightly_default is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/13
 blackburn	sonney2k: lle is really fast now - 223s for 10000 vectors
 blackburn	but superlu to go
@sonney2k	so is it up to par to scikits now?
@sonney2k	or faster?
 blackburn	sonney2k: much faster
@sonney2k	how fast is scikits?
 blackburn	well I didn't test on 10k but on 8k it was 2 times slower
 blackburn	sonney2k: hidden feature of my impl is parallelization - it can really impact on high-dimensional data
 blackburn	I got crazy with superlu, kind of complicated thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: 3k examples:
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 9.007753s
 blackburn	SKLEARN Took 11.569473s
@sonney2k	about the same
 blackburn	sonney2k: wait a minute for 6k
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you write a paper you should have a figure like this showing how much faster your stuff is somewhere (potentially even in shogun docs for dim red stuff)
 blackburn	I know
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will improve perfomance with superlu, then it would be faster, may be significantly
 blackburn	SKLEARN Took 91.296676s
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 61.362044s
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^ not really the same
 blackburn	and now I turn on parallel things
 blackburn	SHOGUN Took 50.653053s
@sonney2k	2 cores?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I believe it would be faster on really multiprocessor machine
@sonney2k	what is the bottleneck currently?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sparse dot and eigenproblem almost the same
 blackburn	neighbor searching is fast
@sonney2k	sparse dot is parallel?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	but eigenproblem is not right?
 blackburn	eigenproblem is not
@sonney2k	is this with lapack?
 blackburn	arpack
@sonney2k	ahh - is arpack much faster?
 blackburn	yes, twice
 blackburn	scikits uses arpack too
@sonney2k	(because there is the parallel scalapack)
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: arpack could impact from parallel lapack
 blackburn	it uses lapack ops
 blackburn	e.g. it provides a pointer to a vector you should product with matrix :)
 blackburn	or solve the system
 blackburn	now I'm using LU/Cholesky decomposition from lapack
 blackburn	it is pretty fast but doesn't take any advantages of matrix being \sparse
 blackburn	sonney2k: well finally, arpack have parallel version too :)
 blackburn	P_ARPACK
 blackburn	no idea how to work with it though
 blackburn	it lacks any docs
@sonney2k	nite
 blackburn	see you
