 blackburn	wiking: could you send me clef data somehow?
 wiking	blackburn: ah yeah
 wiking	i have to redownload as they changed something the other day
 blackburn	wiking: they require some shity papers to sign :D
 wiking	but i'll make it available for you
 wiking	yeye no worries
 blackburn	I guess you did it already
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	do you use dropbox?
 wiking	mmm my drop is full :)))
 wiking	and i really don't want to buy
 wiking	i'll put it on the web for ya
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.190.158] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	wiking: ok thanks
 blackburn	wiking: bad I can't expand your dropbox with shared folder :(
 wiking	eheheh noup
 blackburn	would be nice hehe
 wiking	blackburn: i've made some space on it
 wiking	what's your db account ?
 blackburn	wiking: how large is data btw?
 wiking	it's around 65mb
 wiking	the training set
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	small!
 blackburn	blackburn91@gmail.com
 wiking	yep it's just 1000 pics
 wiking	blackburn: invitation sent... but it's still uploading...
 blackburn	wiking: thanks!
 wiking	nw
 wiking	can i ask maybe actually a favour
 wiking	HOG the pictures?
 wiking	i mean generate hog features of it?
 blackburn	wiking: do you mean my favor
 blackburn	?
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	let me see pictures first ;)
 wiking	u don't want to :p
 wiking	some of them are really scary :)
 blackburn	wiking: damn they are really varying
 blackburn	wiking: I don't think HOGs can help out there..
 wiking	yeah i was guessing so
 wiking	but it's good to have it
 wiking	as well
 blackburn	some classes are really really crazy
 blackburn	wiking: did you use MKL on top of that??
 wiking	nono
 wiking	i used BoW
 wiking	with sift
 blackburn	yeah BoW is the only thing that could work here
 blackburn	wiking: and it was something like of 90% accuracy?
 wiking	not with this
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	last year
 wiking	this year this is fucking crazy
 blackburn	oh shit I opened DVOR class
 wiking	hahahahah
 wiking	doooont!
 blackburn	DFFE#$@#$
 blackburn	WTF
 wiking	not interested :)
 blackburn	oh damn
 blackburn	shit
 blackburn	wtf
 blackburn	FUUUUUUUU
 wiking	told you
 blackburn	I will not sleep anymore
 blackburn	DVDM is nice too..
 blackburn	wiking: I guess this competition is for ones who can to not vomit whole day long seeing this pictures
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn	wiking: text is to be extracted somehow there..
 blackburn	wiking: fmri is much more clean and not vomitting :D

 karlnapf	anybody here?
 karlnapf	my current git doesnt compile, some hash -set related problems
 karlnapf	sonney2k, do you have a clue where that might come from
-!- blackburn [5bde8018@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.222.128.24] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	blackburn, hi
 karlnapf	just cloned current git, does not compile
 blackburn	karlnapf: hey
 blackburn	karlnapf: really ?
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	my options are
 blackburn	feel free to fix ;)
 karlnapf	--enable-debug --disable-optimization --enable-trace ...
 karlnapf	just asking whether you knew about that
 blackburn	compiles here hmm
 karlnapf	which switches are you using?
 blackburn	karlnapf: opt one only
 blackburn	let me check with yours
 blackburn	karlnapf: python_modular?
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	but fails before the module
 karlnapf	works without any switches
 blackburn	karlnapf: uh right
 blackburn	trace mallocs is broken
 karlnapf	is the problem obvious to you? if yes I wont get into it :)  ...
 karlnapf	if no, I will fix it
 blackburn	karlnapf: not obvious but I'll try to take care
 karlnapf	ok then :)
 karlnapf	Will fix my own bugs instead then :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: strange bug actually
 karlnapf	blackburn, I was wondering whether we should add an assert that zero blocks are allocated in the exit_shogun() method
 karlnapf	because some examples contain memleaks
 karlnapf	but they are hidden
 blackburn	karlnapf: hmmm I don't mind it
 karlnapf	if we would enforce not leaking if trace-mallocs is activated
 karlnapf	that would automatically find all of them in the libshogun examples
 blackburn	karlnapf: make check-valgrind does the job btw
 blackburn	in libshogun examples
 karlnapf	oh, really?
 karlnapf	ok did not know that
 karlnapf	 :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: but not trace mallocs
 blackburn	runs valgrind on each example
 karlnapf	but valgrind is better
 karlnapf	although slower :)
 blackburn	and outputs error count
 blackburn	I have added it some day
 karlnapf	blackburn, how does the ref-counting for vectors work?
 karlnapf	do I call ref method
 karlnapf	or do I use SG_REF?
 blackburn	karlnapf: hmmm actually it relies on magic now
 karlnapf	meaning?
 karlnapf	I dont have to do stuff?
 blackburn	karlnapf: copy constructor and constructor increases ref
 karlnapf	and unref?
 blackburn	destructor unrefs
 karlnapf	ah
 karlnapf	nice thing
 karlnapf	will play around with that
 blackburn	karlnapf: e.g. if you have function that has SGVector as parameter
 blackburn	func (SGVector vec)
 karlnapf	yes get it
 blackburn	not const &
 karlnapf	what does const& do?
 blackburn	it calls copy constructor and increases ref for local scope
 karlnapf	oh its a reference
 karlnapf	kk
 blackburn	not "const SGVector& vec"
 blackburn	karlnapf: sounds pretty cool actually
 karlnapf	yes indeed
 karlnapf	Will try to incorparate that into the subset stuff
 karlnapf	currently, everything is copied
 karlnapf	that sucks
 blackburn	karlnapf: ohoh
 karlnapf	whats the matter?
 blackburn	karlnapf: I think we will die in that hell.. :D
 karlnapf	?
 blackburn	karlnapf: painful transition
 karlnapf	with all the vectors?
 blackburn	yeah
 karlnapf	I think its less bad than last year :)
 karlnapf	although we could have done that properly from the beginning :)
 karlnapf	but thats how it works ;)

 gsomix	hi all
 gsomix	karlnapf, hey, what's wrong with hashset?
 gsomix	karlnapf, ah, okay. =___=
 karlnapf	gsomix ,hi :)
 karlnapf	you got it :)
 karlnapf	gsomix, are all the memory errors in make test caused by the SGVector transition?
 gsomix	karlnapf, I don't know really. I'm checking now for my bugs.
@sonney2k	karlnapf, git clean -dfx
 karlnapf	sonney2k, thanks I keep forgetting that
@sonney2k	gsomix, nothing wrong with it
 karlnapf	sonney2k, about this SGVector<char> thing
@sonney2k	people always forget to do it when things change
 karlnapf	I will replace it via a non-sgvector alternative
 karlnapf	otherwise I will have to dig into generich classes which is messy
 gsomix	sonney2k, huh? I found some bugs.
@sonney2k	gsomix, which?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, can you be more concrete?
@sonney2k	void ptr and length or what?
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes
 karlnapf	and actually
 karlnapf	not registering parameters
 karlnapf	for these parameter trees its not necessary anyway
@sonney2k	well ok
 gsomix	sonney2k, wait a minute, please
 karlnapf	perhaps override the serialize method
* sonney2k continues with some intrusive changes all over the place
 karlnapf	sonney2k, even fater git clean -dfx I get all these errors
 karlnapf	I made make distclean and the git clean
 karlnapf	just valgrinded, its SGVector related, will check whether configure switches change something
@sonney2k	karlnapf, which error do you get?
 karlnapf	sonney2k, let me check it a bit more, give me a moment
 karlnapf	currently this spooky one:
 karlnapf	vex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0xC5 0xF9 0x57 0xC0 0xE8 0x63
 karlnapf	64 bit stuff perhaps?

 CIA-113	shogun: - remove various unneedef SG_FREEs - http://git.io/Rn4Ksw
@sonney2k	karlnapf, when you run things with valgrind always use --enable-debug --disable-optimization
@sonney2k	karlnapf, but yes you will still see several crashers due to sgvector
 karlnapf	oh yes of course thats this error
 karlnapf	but this wasnt the one I meant
 karlnapf	ah ok
 karlnapf	alright then
@sonney2k	karlnapf, and it will get worse
@sonney2k	once sgvector is done
@sonney2k	sgmatrix will follow
 karlnapf	ohoh
@sonney2k	sgsparse amtrix
@sonney2k	matrix
@sonney2k	sgstringlist
@sonney2k	but one by one
 karlnapf	mh, I should wait with any changes then
@sonney2k	and sgvector is most used so it is not that bad
 karlnapf	almost half of the tests are failing here
@sonney2k	which tests?
 karlnapf	libshogun
@sonney2k	huh?
 karlnapf	in a freshly cloned repo
@sonney2k	only one fails here
@sonney2k	and I am currently fixing it
 karlnapf	classifier_mklmulticlass, classifier_qda, classifier_multiclasslinearmachine, and more
 karlnapf	gotta go now, will be back in 30 mins
@sonney2k	k
 gsomix	sonney2k, segfaults with --enable-trace-mallocs. in hashset.
@sonney2k	gsomix, heh
@sonney2k	could be endlessly looping
 gsomix	sonney2k, what do you mean?
 gsomix	ah, I got it
@sonney2k	gsomix, you have to check how it was done before to avoid this
@sonney2k	karlnapf, in CKernelMachine - will indices work already?
@sonney2k	and what is params.indices=SGVector<index_t>(0) in apply() supposed to do
@sonney2k	?
 karlnapf	sonney2k, let me have a look
 karlnapf	which line which file?
@sonney2k	shogun/machine/KernelMachine.cpp
 karlnapf	k got it
@sonney2k	304
@sonney2k	(it is disabled right now)
 karlnapf	initialise vector with 0
 karlnapf	the 0 probably sneaked in
 karlnapf	remove it
 karlnapf	but the vector has to be NULL
 karlnapf	sorry not 0, but NULL
 karlnapf	so SGVector<index_t>() will do it
@sonney2k	karlnapf, so removing it will work as good
@sonney2k	(default constructor does NULL already)
 karlnapf	k
 karlnapf	yes true
 karlnapf	sonney2k, any clue why I could have all these memory errors?
 karlnapf	and you dont?

@sonney2k	karlnapf, old shogun?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, btw I have one more question
@sonney2k	I am getting a new error in training error: 1.005422
@sonney2k	cross_validation estimate:
@sonney2k	[2449.555420,2462.500676] with alpha=0.050000, mean=2456.028048
@sonney2k	[ERROR] assertion result.mean<2 failed in file evaluation_cross_validation_regression.cpp line 103
@sonney2k	but no memory errors or anything
 karlnapf	mmh
@sonney2k	valgrind errors I mean
 karlnapf	these values sound like uninitialised memory
 karlnapf	the assertion is there to ensure that the value is small
 karlnapf	so valgrind errors?
 karlnapf	strange
@sonney2k	karlnapf, so that value should be around what you get for training error?
 karlnapf	I mean the estimate is obviously wrong
 karlnapf	no, but the data is linear seperable,
 karlnapf	let me have a look at the example
 karlnapf	oh no, not lin. sep.
@sonney2k	in this transition I am doing a few intrusive changes that can change anything
@sonney2k	one is that get_labels() etc never copies
@sonney2k	and same with CAlphabet
@sonney2k	(we used to always copy there)
 karlnapf	that might be a problem for cross-validation ...
@sonney2k	so if this is assumed somehwere then -> kaboom
 karlnapf	perhaps something with the subsets
@sonney2k	but you call get_labels_copy
 karlnapf	because get_labels with a subset HAS to copy
 karlnapf	a
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	that is probably the reason for the large x-val error and to mem-error: wrong labels
@sonney2k	also get_int_labels will copy
 karlnapf	oh there is at least one bug
@sonney2k	yes?
 karlnapf	get_int_labels
 karlnapf	oh wait
 karlnapf	I might be wrong
 karlnapf	no sorry
 karlnapf	wrong alert
 karlnapf	did the error occur when you changed that get_labels thing? or before?
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	I guess after change
@sonney2k	but still I this is more tricky
@sonney2k	I guess I will continue to try to fix the errors I see in the more elaborate python_modular exmaples
@sonney2k	maybe it is a side effect
 karlnapf	yes, you could remove the assertion for now
@sonney2k	well not remove - I will just work on python_modular and revisit it later
 karlnapf	I guess its something with the splitting strategy producing wrong labels
 karlnapf	ok
 karlnapf	I will try to complete the ModelSelectionparameters thing now
@sonney2k	k
 gsomix	sonney2k, fixed
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r3ceca27 / (5 files in 2 dirs): polish get_labels_copy() and drop load/save from CLabels - http://git.io/YRIo2A
@sonney2k	gsomix, where?
 gsomix	sonney2k, in CSet.
 gsomix	just added use_sg_mallocs flag.
 gsomix	I'm testing now... with --enable-trace-mallocs now. =___=
 karlnapf	sonney2k, gsomix, there are some memory leaks in the model-selection stuff
 karlnapf	modelselection_grid_search_kernel.cpp for example
 karlnapf	mmh, kind of hard to fix as long as there is no trace mallocs, Ill check in later when this works and try to find out whats going on
 karlnapf	Cannot fix the other thing because I dont know whether I cause mem-leaks
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@83.234.54.222] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	is the trace-mallocs working again?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, gsomix found the issue - so very soon
 blackburn	sorry I get a little bit ill
 gsomix	blackburn, grustno
@sonney2k	blackburn, working too hard...
 blackburn	sonney2k: hardly work rather hehe
 gsomix	blackburn, I also got ill.
 blackburn	ok according to logs gsomix you will take care of it?
@sonney2k	basically all multiclass stuff crashes
@sonney2k	gsomix - once this is fixed - please remove all the load() and save() crap ... seems to be in many many classes not only CMachine derived ones...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I know the reason probably
@sonney2k	wow - quite many python examples work already
 blackburn	sonney2k: issue is mainly related with linearmachine's w
@sonney2k	gtg
 gsomix	sonney2k, okay. Added to my todo list. :)
@sonney2k	will be back in ~20 min
 gsomix	karlnapf, ping
 karlnapf	gsomix, hi
 karlnapf	got it?
 gsomix	karlnapf, yep. can you review and merge it?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 blackburn	wow I never expected
 karlnapf	will do
 karlnapf	gsomix, does it compile with trace-mallocs without adding more errors in tests?
 blackburn	karlnapf: set is used only in memory blocks counting ;)
 gsomix	karlnapf, yep, it seems.
 karlnapf	patch looks nice, I dont know what you talked about with soeren about this default constructor, if you agreed on that I iwll merge

 karlnapf	classifier_libsvm is the first one
 karlnapf	classifier_minimal_svm
 karlnapf	gaussian_naive_bayes does not terminate
 gsomix	karlnapf, okay, thanks.
 blackburn	for brave souls who want to solve multiclass machines - the error is in copy constructor of linear machine
 karlnapf	gsomix, do the tests run for you?
 blackburn	it is being double freed for some reason
 blackburn	ah and also subsets are b0rken
 karlnapf	blackburn, yes these are probably because of SGVector stuff
 karlnapf	I will review that once the other stuff works
