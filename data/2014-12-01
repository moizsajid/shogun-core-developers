@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@lisitsyn	I think I have some vague idea
@lisitsyn	this happened when dsfmt thing was introduced
@lisitsyn	the randomization stuff
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  hey!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: this has to do something with SSE I believe
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	whats the context, I am lost :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: your python crash
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	ah I solved it
@lisitsyn	really?
@HeikoS	python version conflict
@HeikoS	coming from virtualenv
@HeikoS	we should have a faq where this is in
@HeikoS	our mailing list is full of those questions
@lisitsyn	whywhy
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	ahh got it
@lisitsyn	compiled with different Py* stuff
@lisitsyn	obvious
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  see email
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: which?
@HeikoS	shogun team
@HeikoS	just sent
@lisitsyn	not yet here
@wiking	nothin yet
@lisitsyn	wiking: hey there
@HeikoS	maybe needs to be approved
@wiking	yo
@HeikoS	wiking: pretty cool
@HeikoS	wiking: we should really release ASAP
@HeikoS	its taking too long
@wiking	HeikoS: mm yeah
@wiking	indeed
@HeikoS	cant we postpone unsolved things?
@lisitsyn	yeah that sucks everything sucks :D
@HeikoS	and get a release, and a cloud?
@wiking	eeeverything suuuucks
@HeikoS	and a binary?
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	aaaand what else?
@HeikoS	just that
@HeikoS	I mean gsoc feature release
@HeikoS	and then fix all shit in a clean up release
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.212.91.214] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
@wiking	ok with's with the csv fix?
@wiking	anybody reviewed that one?
@wiking	is it merged?
@HeikoS	I can look
@wiking	by gsomix
@wiking	the swig guys are not so responsive
@wiking	since we still dont know what could be the best way to fix the python + swig3 segfault thngy
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah
@HeikoS	rather maybe put as "known issue"=
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://www.speedtest.net/result/3951065128.png
@HeikoS	I resent email
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: wow awesome
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	AND
@HeikoS	Arthur here wants to use Shogun for kernel course
@wiking	i haven't received it yet
@HeikoS	so if we have the cloud that makes it much easier
@wiking	fuck gmail
@HeikoS	wiking: haha
@lisitsyn	ok that's really important
@wiking	dude
@wiking	your emails always end up in junk
@wiking	i really dont know why
@wiking	fucking gmail seriously
@lisitsyn	naive bayes
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	wiking: just found an email of yours in spam :)
@wiking	oh
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	nice
@wiking	hahaha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and one of yours
@wiking	we are spaming each ther
@wiking	other
@wiking	:D
@wiking	ok so we need everything now working asap
@wiking	clean and super
@wiking	ok well u know what is required for that task HeikoS
@wiking	;DDD
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: can we suggest him some kind of support/
@HeikoS	wiking: haha
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn we need a masterplan of things
@HeikoS	but release even before
@HeikoS	so dropping the swig issue?
@HeikoS	what else do we need
@HeikoS	notebooks still fail? but thats easy to fix
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	opencv only no?
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	wiking: can we get a release binary without fixing the swig?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	anyways
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	it's not a problem on linux
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	great
@wiking	i mean it is
@wiking	but only on very latest unstable version of distros
@wiking	it's a bigger issue on os
@wiking	osx
@HeikoS	yeah thats true
@HeikoS	but still can do this later and put as known issue?
@HeikoS	or quickfix?
@wiking	btw has anybody tried C# interface with mono 3.x ?
@HeikoS	wiking: nope
@wiking	yeah it'd be interesting on linux
@wiking	i mean it works on buildbot
@wiking	what's on fatbot?
@wiking	lisitsyn: likey my new inetz? :D
@wiking	ah yeah this is why it does not fail: Mono C# compiler version 2.10.8.1
@lisitsyn	wiking: what's with your inetz? :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: check the link
@HeikoS	wiking: should I quickly give it a shot?
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://www.speedtest.net/result/3951065128.png
@wiking	HeikoS: no it's ok
@wiking	i realised why it's working on linux
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh sh
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	same story as with the swig :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: and it's so slow because i'm testing it via wifi ;)
@wiking	:P
@wiking	(i dont have the thunderbolt converter for gigabit ethernet :P)
@HeikoS	wiking: is there a step by step list for release?
@HeikoS	if not maybe have it on wiki
@wiking	HeikoS: noup
@HeikoS	I would do it, but I dont know how
@wiking	i need to do that
@wiking	i mean the thing is that that part hasn't been ported
@wiking	and it's an urgent thing
@wiking	so
@wiking	give 24 hours for this task to be finished
@wiking	u check the whole csv story
@wiking	that's going to be a blocker anyways
@wiking	ppl will be crazy mad when they can only read 15megs of cvs files
@wiking	;P
@lisitsyn	hah yes
@lisitsyn	this bug is like WTF
@HeikoS	ok let me check
@HeikoS	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1991 this one?
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	phew
@wiking	gsomix sent int a pr for that
@HeikoS	any ideas what this is?
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	its not referenced
@HeikoS	wiking: cannot find it
@HeikoS	where
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	shit
@wiking	i dont know why i had this impression
@wiking	that i've seen a pr about this
@HeikoS	wiking: another point on known issues
@HeikoS	this gives as a "first things to fix" list for next release
@wiking	no i mean this is an issues that could be fix right away
@wiking	i mean this is a really WTF issue
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont know how to fix it right away at the moment
@wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	wiking: its not that big of a deal
@HeikoS	since numpy/ etc provide these functions, so we cover say 80% of people
@wiking	how the fuck is that not a big deal
@wiking	we are claiming that we are a large scale ML library
@HeikoS	I agree with you
@HeikoS	BUT
@wiking	and we dont know how to read a csv more than 12megz
@HeikoS	we still havent released, and if you are using python then you dont need CSVFile
@HeikoS	so just a matter of order
@HeikoS	I agree its high priority, but it hasnt been fixed in a while
@HeikoS	and I dont know how to do it, so unlikely that it happens soon, or?
@HeikoS	we can put a label "feature release" or so,
@HeikoS	GSoC release
@HeikoS	what do you think?
@wiking	mmm i'm just debugging it
@wiking	that's what i think
@wiking	ahahha awesome ad: "icflix wants a Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
@wiking	who doesn't want a Dubai :D
@HeikoS	wiking: haha
@HeikoS	wiking: ok so what do you propose regarding this?
@wiking	fix it
@wiking	what wlese
@wiking	*else
@HeikoS	wiking: more concrete, I mean regarding release etc
@HeikoS	time schedule etc
@HeikoS	wiking: I will try to have a look at this soon then
@HeikoS	wiking: could you try to write down release steps somewhere so that someone as foolish as myself could do it? :D
@wiking	there's no such thing
@wiking	you have to figure it out yourself
@HeikoS	just asking to share your insights from last release
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: could also helpo
@lisitsyn	ooh
@lisitsyn	I never did it actually
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we had make release :D
@lisitsyn	and it worked actually hah
