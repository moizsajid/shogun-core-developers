 CaBa	you guys need better internet connectivity ;)
@HeikoS	hehe ;)
@HeikoS	well life, work and all that is also going on
 CaBa	HeikoS: :)
 CaBa	HeikoS: can i ask you a quick question nontheless? :P
 CaBa	HeikoS: i have a custom string kernel that currently works on StringFeatures<char>... now i want to enhance it's performance by precomputing some indices over those sequences and use them instead of the sequences itself in ::compute().
@HeikoS	sure
@HeikoS	CaBa: I think for that you would have to modify the code a bit
 CaBa	HeikoS: my problem is - i only realized afterwards that the lhs and rhs members of CKernel are *not* exclusively modified through CKernel::init() - i thought that was the only place where i had to update the indices
 CaBa	HeikoS: i was thinking... i should precompute everything and then have a kernel that works on the indices only... but those are complex objects. is there a CFeatures class for that?
 CaBa	HeikoS: or how about CStringFeatures<T>? Does that actually work for *any* T, as long as compute() can handle T?

 CaBa	HeikoS: ping
@HeikoS	jo
 CaBa	HeikoS: tell me... SGString, SGStringList - they are not implemented for any type T?
 CaBa	like - the generic version is non functional?
@HeikoS	CaBa: only for basic types I think
@HeikoS	but not sure
 CaBa	>.<
@HeikoS	what type did you try?
 CaBa	my own class
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	reason why you do that?
 CaBa	well... i want to use the index data structures as features and CKernel::compute() on that...
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	I see
 CaBa	HeikoS: is there any feature type that can take "whatever" per sample and let me handle the kernel function myself in ::compute() and that's it?
@HeikoS	I wanted to kick out supporting strings of vectors/matrices a long time ago
@HeikoS	nope that is not there
@HeikoS	I mean it can be added
 CaBa	>.<
@HeikoS	and precomputing the kernel?
@HeikoS	CaBa: your think would be a hack
 CaBa	what's the precomputing the kernel option?
 CaBa	CCustomKernel?
@HeikoS	as the kernel behaves differently based on what feature type is in there (at least in the current way we do this)
@HeikoS	CaBa: yes precomputing the matrix
@HeikoS	and using that
@HeikoS	via CustmKernel
 CaBa	HeikoS: is CustomKernel fully functional? can i use it in CCombinedKernel?
@HeikoS	even works with cross-validation
@HeikoS	CaBa: I did that once, but it is a few years ago
 CaBa	HeikoS: ok, so subsetting works in CCustomKernel?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but xvalidation and custom kernel AND combined kernel
@HeikoS	I dont know
@HeikoS	probably not
@HeikoS	I think I wrote an example for this at some point
@HeikoS	and added the feature to the news
@HeikoS	but that must be 2011 or so

-!- mode/#shogun [+o besser82] by ChanServ
 CaBa	HeikoS: for custom kernel you mean?
@HeikoS	custom kernel xvalidation
@HeikoS	and also custom kernel and combined kernel (I think)
@HeikoS	All of this stuff is quite useful to sort out generally
 CaBa	HeikoS: so maybe it works alltogether?
@HeikoS	so we would be quite happy to have that
@HeikoS	I mean give it a try
@HeikoS	if it runs, I am sure it does sensible things
 CaBa	HeikoS: so with customkernel there is nothing i need to do other than compute the SGMatrix<> and construct CCustomKernel(matrix)?
 CaBa	HeikoS: does it still handle normalization through set_normalizer()?
 CaBa	or do i have to do that beforehand, too?
@HeikoS	before
@HeikoS	you can just pass a CKernel in the constructor of CCustomKernel I think
@HeikoS	and it does the job for you
 CaBa	what do you mean?
 CaBa	what CKernel should i pass?
@HeikoS	any shogun kernel
@HeikoS	but matrix is fine as well
 CaBa	HeikoS: so can it handle the normalization for me?
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	it just stores numbers
@HeikoS	(it might but better day no for now)
 CaBa	yee, i should have compiled every now and then... took me a full day of implementation to realize that SGString<T> won't compile for any 'T'
@HeikoS	oh yes, alwayw compile all the time
@HeikoS	use ccache to make it fast
 CaBa	i'm just compiling my own tool, that's just 10 compilation units or so :P
@HeikoS	ah i see
@HeikoS	okok
 CaBa	:'(
 CaBa	well here we go, attempt #3 with CCustomKernel...
@HeikoS	let me know how it gues
@HeikoS	share results if you  make improvements
 CaBa	HeikoS: hmmm - so normally normalization would be applied on every subset during x-val, right?
@HeikoS	I think that is what is done
@HeikoS	but better check the code
 CaBa	HeikoS: that cannot be achieved with a pre-computed and pre-normalized matrix if the customkernel cannot do it
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	true
@HeikoS	very true
@HeikoS	so then no normalisation
@HeikoS	in that context
@HeikoS	or the custom kernel does that on its subsets
@HeikoS	but that I know it doesnt yet (would be easy to add)
 CaBa	:(
