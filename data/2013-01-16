 wiking	Linking CXX executable tapkee
 wiking	ld: library not found for -larpack
 wiking	clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
 wiking	make[2]: *** [tapkee] Error 1
 wiking	make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/tapkee.dir/all] Error 2
 wiking	make: *** [all] Error 2
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	may be I need to add linker path
 wiking	-- Found Eigen3: /opt/local/include/eigen3 (Required is at least version "2.91.0")
 wiking	-- Found Arpack : /opt/local/lib/libparpack.dylib
 wiking	so it found it
 wiking	but then
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	cmake fucks it up in some way
 wiking	/usr/bin/c++    -Wl,-search_paths_first -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names   CMakeFiles/tapkee.dir/src/main.cpp.o  -o tapkee  -larpack
 wiking	this is in
 wiking	CMakeFiles/tapkee.dir/link.txt
 blackburn	hmm
 wiking	so somehow you have to tell cmake that it adds the link path, -L
 wiking	since it knows/finds where it is
 blackburn	wiking: yeah thanks
 blackburn	let me try to find that
 wiking	no worries
 wiking	let me know when u need a 2nd test
