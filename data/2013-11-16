 Boeke	hello I recently installed shogun 3.0 with the modular python interface. I am unable to load any of the Labels modules. Looking at some of the support resources I suspect am missing something labels depends on. Can anyone help me out?

@sonney2k	Boeke, just do
@sonney2k	import modshogun as msg
@sonney2k	x=msg.BinaryLabels(numpy.array([-1.0,1.0]))
 Boeke	hi thanks for the reply I get the error AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'BinaryLabels'
 Boeke	I have imported and run other modules but have not had any success  with BinaryLabels
@sonney2k	Boeke, not possible...
@sonney2k	Boeke, do you perhaps have multiple shogun installs around?
@sonney2k	Boeke, I mean an old version of modshogun still had modshogun.Labels
 Boeke	I should clarify  I can load and run things like GaussianKernel, LibSVMOneClass,RealFeatures but can't get BinaryLabels, MultiClassLabels ect. to load
@sonney2k	Boeke, expected that
@sonney2k	Boeke, I just replied on the ML - can you import Labels?
 Boeke	yes I can
@sonney2k	Boeke, so you still have an old modshogun installed
@sonney2k	from version 2.x or so!
 Boeke	yes I am new to linux and kinda floundered around installing stuff. So I guess I should clean things up and reinstall right?
@sonney2k	Boeke, you did compile your own right?
@sonney2k	if so get rid of these files /usr/local/lib/python*/*packages/*shogu*
 Boeke	yes and no I did grab an old pre compiled one and that looks to be a problem
 Boeke	I'm going to uninstall and reinstall python  and shogun. Thanks for the help.

@sonney2k	Boeke, there is no binary shogun 3;x package yet
@sonney2k	Boeke, so you would have to compile manually!
 Boeke	oh ok I had some trouble doing that
@wiking	Boeke: copy-paste your trouble
 Boeke	ok will do
@wiking	sonney2k: shouldn't we add debian package stuff to the repo?
@wiking	same with the fedora script?
@sonney2k	wiking, distributions don't like that
@sonney2k	wiking, it is normal to do it externally
@sonney2k	but it is just libshogun currently :/
@sonney2k	we need a way to build the modular interfaces w/o having the shogun dir around
@wiking	sonney2k: only having -dev?
@wiking	right?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes exactly
@sonney2k	I mean we could in the worst case create some shogun symlink to /usr/include/shogun or so for the time being
@sonney2k	but .cpp files are gone
@sonney2k	and we should not create a libshogun*so
@sonney2k	wiking, I didn't do debian packaging for a few years
@sonney2k	looking at it - it was a huge mistake to not have shogun available
@sonney2k	for example
@sonney2k	shogun was more popular than weka debian package wise
@sonney2k	but recently weka just skyrocketed
@sonney2k	wiking, http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=sonne%40debian.org
@sonney2k	look at the column Popcon
@sonney2k	weka has >800 installs now
@sonney2k	but used to have around 100
@sonney2k	and shogun around 300 IIRC
@sonney2k	wiking, so if you can do it it would be *very* important
@wiking	yep i get it
@sonney2k	wiking, if we can complement that with nightly packages we should be back on track!
@wiking	well nightly should be easy ;)
@wiking	just another task + upload it somewhere
@sonney2k	wiking, the problem really is the packaging
@sonney2k	it took hours to write the copyright file
 Boeke	so I installed form source  but now I get a new error
 Boeke	 ImportError: libshogun.so.14: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
@wiking	Boeke: i guess you did make install right?
@wiking	what do you get if u do ls -la /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so.14
@wiking	?
@sonney2k	Boeke, and also please do sudo ldconfig afterwards
@wiking	sonney2k: what we need actually is a cmake file which is similar to pkg-config
@wiking	sonney2k: so basically a way to detect whether libshogun is already installed or not
 Boeke	oh sorry i get
 Boeke	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 Nov 16 11:22 /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so.14 -> libshogun.so.14.0
@wiking	Boeke: ok so u you actually have it there.. well then do what sonney2k just wrote to u. that should do it
 Boeke	ok I did that and it worked. I loaded BinaryLabels. Thank you for all the help!
@wiking	sonney2k: btw: i guess we should do a version check as well, or?
@sonney2k	wiking, I think we don't need a version check
@wiking	sonney2k: i.e. if we detect a shogun 2.x and we have 3.x to generate the modular stuff, then i guess we should error
@sonney2k	wiking, or? I mean won't swig generate wrappers for any *.h's?
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah indeed - some includes won't be found so it won't work
@sonney2k	wiking, if we forget about version checking for the moment - how would we do it?
@sonney2k	let me think loudly
@sonney2k	so we need to basically do 2 things
@sonney2k	run swig
@sonney2k	compile swig wrapper
@sonney2k	and link
@sonney2k	that's it
@wiking	well
@wiking	we just run the whole modular thing of cmake
@wiking	only that the include will not be from ./src/... but from /usr/....
@wiking	or wherever the detected installed version resides
@wiking	same goes for -L flag
@sonney2k	wiking, so all we need is a detection for an already installed shogun - or maybe not a detection but some flag telling it to use that?
@wiking	both
@wiking	but
@wiking	we still need to get like cflags from the config.h
@sonney2k	wiking, no no
@wiking	why?
@sonney2k	we just need to link against libshogun
@sonney2k	and compile with -O0
@sonney2k	remember libshogun is self contained
@wiking	yes but how do we compile the .cxx generated by swig?
@sonney2k	so no extra deps needed
@sonney2k	but the defines!!
@wiking	i mean there are currently heaps of -D flags
@wiking	passed
@sonney2k	we need these yes
@wiking	so then
@wiking	we need a config.h -> -D converter
@wiking	right?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	#define CONFIGURE_OPTIONS "TODO"
@sonney2k	haha :)
@wiking	and i already see the problem of HAVE_JBLAS in config.h
@wiking	as that's really fucked up
@sonney2k	and actually we also need
@sonney2k	std=c++11 IIRC?
@wiking	because let's say the moment u've installed libshogun u did not have jblas but then u decided that u want java_modualr
@wiking	then u'll install jblas
@wiking	and then what do u do with the config.h? :)
@wiking	that's actually already installed
@wiking	and we suppose to do read-only on config.h
@wiking	same goes for NARRAY_LIB
@wiking	and how do you want to enable swig directors? :)
@wiking	i mean u just cant
@wiking	:P
@sonney2k	forget directors
@sonney2k	and forget ruby / java for now
@wiking	kk
@sonney2k	lets do the most important interface first
@sonney2k	python
@sonney2k	we don't have such issues there right?
@sonney2k	``only'' the c++11 thing
@wiking	well that's ...
@sonney2k	wiking, well I could easily write some .py that creates the -DHAVE_HDF5 magic
@sonney2k	wiking, shall I?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	nooo
@sonney2k	we have python as build dep anyway so it won't matter?
@sonney2k	wiking, better ideas?
@wiking	either we can write out into config.h the -D in another variable
@wiking	like for compflags
@wiking	or just write a simple cmake script for doing it
@sonney2k	wiking, my cmake skills are limited wrt that the python thing I have done in 2 mins max

@sonney2k	wiking, I am sick now and cannot do much other than lying around coding so it would rather want to make progress now or never :)
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	there's this command in cmake
