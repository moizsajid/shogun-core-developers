 sonne|work	n4nd0: thanks!
 n4nd0	:)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: look - it is worth it: http://freecode.com/projects/shogun/date_metrics
 n4nd0	O_O
 n4nd0	lot of people noted the new release :D
 sonne|work	n4nd0: now we need nice figures like in http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/category/blog/#shogun-google-summer-code-2011
 sonne|work	and write a blog post ...
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	sonne|work: should we all work on that?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: if you could write sth / create some figures - it would help me a lot... it is a lot of work and I don't have that much time...
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I think I can find some time for it during the weekend
 sonne|work	n4nd0: something that we should do is automatically create figures from our graphical examples and put the code that created the figure directly under the image live on the website
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what is the correct approach to do that? some python script to start with?
 sonne|work	well we start with python yes - and would need to change all scripts to optionally write out a figure

 sonne|work	blackburn: I think we should start to use issues on github a lot more
 sonne|work	if we don't do this then everything is just forgotten
 blackburn	sonne|work: I feel a little unsatisfied with github interface but yes
 sonne|work	yeah sure but better than having to setup our own system and dealing with spam etc
 blackburn	may be we could push github developers if we get what is wrong with it
 sonne|work	blackburn: just file an issue in their system *lol*
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	yes, once I recognize what is I am unsatisfied with
 blackburn	we also need to use #xxx more
 blackburn	not a porn, but mentions of issues in commits
 sonne|work	heh sure
 blackburn	hmm I recall there was some porn detectors
 blackburn	I am curious whether they based on deep learning :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: I guess shallow as well as deep learning is used *scnr*
 blackburn	:D
