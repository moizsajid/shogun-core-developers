 Mathnerd314	hello. does shogun do anything with word2vec?
 Mathnerd314	I'm looking for a quick-n-dirty sentence similarity metric, I found http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keeley_Crockett/publication/232645326_Sentence_Similarity_Based_on_Semantic_Nets_and_Corpus_Statistics/links/0deec51b8db68f19fa000000
 Mathnerd314	so I was thinking I could use word2vec + their sentence similarity measure
 Mathnerd314	oh wait, I should have read the IRC log better
 Mathnerd314	apparently somebody else came on and asked about word2vec and got shot down :p
 Mathnerd314	well, they're both written in langauges in the C family...
 Mathnerd314	and unlike him I can actually compile it :-)
 Mathnerd314	so I guess I'll stick around. anyone mind if I post my random attempts at things to the channel?

@wiking	no go ahad
@wiking	*ahead
 Mathnerd314	I guess the question is whether shogun does any vector space stuff. I saw a 2013 GSOC project idea for improved dimensional reduction, was that chosen/successful?
@wiking	Mathnerd314: all that shogun does is in vectorspace
@wiking	so yeah it has vector space stuff
