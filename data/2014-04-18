@sonney2k	lambday_, it says possibly lost - so relax
* sonney2k yay easter holdays
 lambday_	sonney2k: yeah... its kind of annoying though
 lambday_	sonney2k: long time no see! :D
@sonney2k	yeah busy...
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh who's there
@sonney2k	lambday_, well I mean it is harmless if libraries at startup allocate some buffers that they never free
@sonney2k	I mean it can only be freed once done using the lib which usually is only on program exit
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh
 lambday_	sonney2k: yeah I was stuck at it for a while until lisitsyn explained it to me..
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: have you seen my fancy blog?!
@lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, YOU HAVE A BLOG?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, kidding?
 lambday_	sonney2k: it does mean a thing :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: now yes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, are you on shogun planet just yet?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I don't think so
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well then give me the url and I put you live :D
@lisitsyn	I forgot about this thing
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: http://sergey.lisitsyn.me
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I need the rss
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am not sure I set it up
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: is atom.xml the right thing?
@lisitsyn	if it doesn't work I can set up rss as well I guess
@sonney2k	http://sergey.lisitsyn.me/atom.xml right?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: correct
@sonney2k	man I am brainwashed
@sonney2k	all shogun related knowledges swapped out
@lisitsyn	hmm I have no idea what's with rss in octopress
* sonney2k is trying to find some backup tapes
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: knowledges like?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, anything
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: hmm is std::vector contiguous?
 lambday_	lol
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, accoring to latest standards it is hurray!
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: starting from C98
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	it was latest when you were young ;)
@lisitsyn	btw in C++14
@lisitsyn	you can finally do
@lisitsyn	[] (auto x) { ... }
@lisitsyn	generic lambdas!
 lambday_	I heard lambda
@lisitsyn	lambday_: what does [&] in lambda mean? ;)
@lisitsyn	<interview mode>
 lambday_	lisitsyn: take by ref
 lambday_	?
@lisitsyn	take what by ref?
 lambday_	whatever you pass :-/
 lambday_	from env
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, there we go http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun
@lisitsyn	lambday_: env? ;) what is env?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ha cool thanks
 lambday_	any var that
 lambday_	s's defined in that scope?
 lambday_	:P
@lisitsyn	lambday_: yeah scope is correct ;)
@lisitsyn	lambday_: what is [=]?
 lambday_	forgot :D
* lambday_ quick googles
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, will you attend the dedup meeting?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	excellent
 lambday_	lisitsyn: found :D
@lisitsyn	lambday_: by value, right? ;)
 lambday_	lisitsyn: yo!
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: if I get hit by bus
@lisitsyn	heiko will take care
@lisitsyn	:D

@lisitsyn	http://blog.smola.org/post/82937674537/beware-the-bandwidth-gap-speeding-up-optimization
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, or you don't find the way around the fance ;)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: hah you have enjoyed this video it seems
@lisitsyn	lambday_: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IAXrxlDK6c
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, pretty obvious isn't it?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's funny cause I don't really get it :D
@lisitsyn	it seems if you live here that's ok
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: have you heard mahout is moving to spark?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes seen that
@sonney2k	map reduce is close to useless for ML
@sonney2k	it has always been
@sonney2k	it is googles way of computing very simple statistics
@sonney2k	which is sufficient if you have massive data in *many* cases
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I still think we should find a way into distributed things

@sonney2k	lisitsyn2, well do it :) I don't have big enough data for that :D
@sonney2k	so for me personally what we have is sufficient
 lisitsyn2	sonney2k: yeah that is apparently the main thing
@sonney2k	so it somebody who has too much data should take care of that
 lisitsyn2	if we want to be distributed
 lisitsyn2	we need to have a few machines
 lisitsyn2	I don't really have a cluster :D
@sonney2k	well none of us used the google grant right
@sonney2k	no idea really how we could get this to work other than bying a couple of el-cheapo machines
 lisitsyn2	sonney2k: is this grant lost?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn2, it times out after 6 months
 lisitsyn2	sucks
@sonney2k	lisitsyn2, you know I have a cellar
@sonney2k	so maybe 5 cheap nodes should be doable
 lisitsyn2	want to pay electricity bills? ;)
 lisitsyn2	sonney2k: isn't it not el cheapo?
@sonney2k	no shogun foundation has to as well as for the machines if we want that. maybe each 32G or so
@sonney2k	but electricity is not the main thing if the machines idle
@sonney2k	lisitsyn2, alternative is we rent  a couple of machines

 lisitsyn	damn!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well about 3000 EUR for 5 such machines, with each quadcore i7's (3.4GHz and 32G memory, 1TB disk)
 lisitsyn	battery effectively died :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I mean this would be a very sane investment if we find a sponsor
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, your new and 'shiny' notebook already?

 lambday	HeikoS: hey!
 lambday	HeikoS: lisitsyn1: can I use std::pair as a return type? I need to return two SGVectors of different length... SGMatrix is not really a good idea for that
 lisitsyn1	lambday: hey
 lisitsyn1	lambday: return type of what?
-!- lambday_ [67157f4f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.127.79] has joined #shogun
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: hola
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: return type of a public method of CKernel
 lambday_	SWIG supports std::pair
 lambday_	but may be gotta att template() std_pair<SGVector<float64_t>,SGVector<float64_t> > in modshogun.i for that to work?
-!- lambday [67157f4f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.127.79] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: oh well I'd avoid it :D
 lisitsyn1	think how it would look like in python, java and say octave
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: well, in python a tuple of numpy vectors :D
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: so what do you suggest?
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: no clue yet, let me think
 lambday_	SGMatrix is waste of memory since their size differs
 lambday_	CList is overkill
 lambday_	may be just concatenated vectors
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: what are these vectors?
 lambday_	first n entries belong to vector a and m entries belong to vector b
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: vec1 = row-wise sum of kernel values
 lambday_	vec2 = col-wise     -do-
 lambday_	(when its not symmetric)
 lisitsyn1	ahh
 lambday_	I don't want to call CKernel::kernel(i, j) more than once per (i,j) so I need to return both of these in one method
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: what about some precomputing on call
 lisitsyn1	and two methods?
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: if I can precompute the whole kernel matrix then we won't be needing these methods
 lisitsyn1	no I mean
 lisitsyn1	if you want col sums
 lisitsyn1	you precompute col/row sums
 lisitsyn1	and return col sums
 lambday_	storing things between calls?
 lisitsyn1	???
 lisitsyn1	yes
 lisitsyn1	:D sorry
 lambday_	?? ??? ?????
 lambday_	:?
 lisitsyn1	hahaha
 lambday_	umm... lisitsyn1 I don't like storing :(
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: possible bugs
 lambday_	concatenation can do - the callee always know the num-rows and num-cols... so a vec of num-rows+num_cols element can do I guess .... first vec[0:num_rows] are row-wise sums and rest are col-wise sums
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: why clist is overkill?
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: concatenation looks like a workaround for me
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: because its just 2 elements... we can do better than a linked list
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: is it expected to be used often?
 lambday_	lisitsyn1: fairly
 lisitsyn1	lambday_: hmm..

 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	lambday_: very nice work!
@HeikoS	lambday_: this also will make the MMD stuff on custom kernels a lot faster
@HeikoS	as we dont loop over these virtual method calls anymore

@HeikoS	yeah e-14 is ok :)
@HeikoS	lambday_: I would actually be interested in a performance coparison
@HeikoS	lambday_: are you interested in coding one up and put into benchmarks?
@HeikoS	lambday_: google doesnt really answer this
@HeikoS	lambday_: all probably depends on compiler optimisations
 lambday_	HeikoS: with previous implementation and with replaced by these calls?
@HeikoS	lambday_: not for MMD but kernel in general
@HeikoS	one that loops over the ::kernel calls
@HeikoS	and one that calls your method
@HeikoS	for Custom kernel
@HeikoS	for GaussianKernel or others it should be the same since the kernel call has to be done
@HeikoS	::kenrel call I mean
@HeikoS	ah wait
 lambday_	HeikoS: I am interested in setting up these benchmarks..
 lambday_	HeikoS: will try to do it by tonight
 lambday_	HeikoS: I will just be back after dinner :)
