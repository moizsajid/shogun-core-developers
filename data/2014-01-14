 sonne|osx	wiking: no it is not that. if I compile without libstdc++ libshogun compiles just fine
 sonne|osx	wiking: but swig then doesn't
 sonne|osx	wiking: so we need libc++ for protbuf
 sonne|osx	*protobuf
 sonne|osx	and libstdc++ for swig at this moment

@wiking	anybody knows a good way to handle a pool or processes where each process has it's own thread pool in python? :)

 thoralf	Hey.
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.121.237] has joined #shogun
 naywhayare	hello folks, I have two things today
 naywhayare	a) I'm going to be running the shogun benchmarks for the latest shogun release in a week or two (I have to wait until the mlpack ones are done, and they take two weeks ...);
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.121.237] has quit [Client Quit]
 naywhayare	I'd like to know if anyone would be interested in looking at our python scripts to see if they can be significantly improved or basically just to make sure we're not doing anything stupid
 naywhayare	b) I know you guys wrap john langford's cover tree implementation for nearest neighbor search, so I thought I would let you know that there's an unfixed bug in it (an invalid prune) so until he fixes it, that code is wrong

 lisitsyn	naywhayare: hey!
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: about a) I think people around would take a look
 lisitsyn	and b) well it is pure bs, shoulda be dropped :D
 naywhayare	lisitsyn: here are the scripts we have: http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/mlpack/conf/jenkins-conf/benchmark/methods/shogun/
 naywhayare	and that cover tree code... it took me a month to figure out whether or not the bug was actually a bug and develop the minimal test case
 naywhayare	john langford should send me some money for my work... heh...
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: code looks quite legit from the first sight
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: do you have your own impl of cover tree?
 naywhayare	lisitsyn: yeah, but it's not as fast as his
 naywhayare	I'm working on speeding it up, but it gets difficult.  what I wanted was an implementation of cover trees for any tree-based algorithm, not just nearest neighbor
 naywhayare	so I have to implement it kind of abstractly, but also at the same time make it as fast as his, and I haven't managed to do that yet...
 lisitsyn	naywhayare: we could think if we can implement some module we can both share
 lisitsyn	e.g. gsoc task etc ;)

 sonne|osx	iglesiasg, wiking, lisitsyn - I am stiing in the c-base right now :)
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: heh
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, wow, cool
@iglesiasg	have a beer for all of us :)
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: I will
 sonne|osx	intend to donate some $$$ to them - long promised but never managed
@iglesiasg	oh good
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: I looked at the failing tests yesterday - some indeed are just numerical issues easy to fix
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, just re-generating  the data files I guess?
 sonne|osx	some yes
 sonne|osx	not all
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, what about the others? which ones looked fishy?
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: don't remember was busy with osx buildbot
@iglesiasg	ok
 sonne|osx	but osx is so f#%($*%d up...
 sonne|osx	a) they switched their compiler to clang
 sonne|osx	b) they are dropping usage of libstdc++
 sonne|osx	introducing libc++
 sonne|osx	which is not compatible
 sonne|osx	so stuff linked against libc++ won't link against libstdc++
-!- zxtx_ [~zv@129-79-241-148.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 sonne|osx	which is what shogun uses due to some error with swig
 naywhayare	lisitsyn: perhaps :) the benchmarking system that one of our GSoC students made this past summer could be used by you guys too (HeikoS was interested, but I don't know if he has or will have the time to look into it anytime soon...)
 sonne|osx	naywhayare: yes it would be something nice to have
-!- besser82 [quassel@fedora/besser82] has quit [Quit: freedom, friends, features, first ---> fedoraproject.org]
 sonne|osx	naywhayare: but who has time to do stuff ...
 sonne|osx	wiking: what is generating shogun-unit-test_test.cmake ?
 sonne|osx	cmake on the osx builbot complains about tons of syntax errors leading to a log file of size >30MB...
 naywhayare	sonne|osx: too true, I haven't even had time to go over the interface for the benchmarks and make it more intuitive, and it's been like five months now ...
 sonne|osx	naywhayare: I really wonder why everyone is having the same issue :)
 naywhayare	I need either clones of myself or a way to dump responsibilities on someone else, but I don't have time to create either !
 naywhayare	I think farmers used to just have a bunch of kids to solve this problem, but the lead time on that is like 18-20 years
 sonne|osx	naywhayare: hehe
