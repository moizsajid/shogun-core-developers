 lisitsyn	we pluginize concrete machine
 lambday	base classes always need to be compiled as you said
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	no other way around that I guess
 lisitsyn	lambday: https://github.com/lisitsyn/aer/blob/master/test_lib_src/library.cpp#L26
 lambday	lisitsyn: could you please give me the link of your poc implementation
 lisitsyn	that's how we export library
 lambday	oh :D
 lisitsyn	lambday: we begin manifest declaring the name of the library
 lisitsyn	next we export class mentioning its base class
 lisitsyn	and name
 lisitsyn	once we are done we are closing the manifest
 lisitsyn	I did some crazy stuff inside - should be simpler
 lisitsyn	but this works
 lambday	alright let me check
 lambday	but doing this in shogun is gonna be crazy huge!
 lisitsyn	lambday: nobody promised it being easy :D
 lisitsyn	lambday: but why *huge*?
 lisitsyn	well I can agree
 lisitsyn	but essentially that would be about putting manifests

 lambday_	lisitsyn: sorry man got dc
 lisitsyn	(02:04:19) lisitsyn: lambday: nobody promised it being easy :D
 lisitsyn	(02:05:47) lisitsyn: lambday: but why *huge*?
 lisitsyn	(02:06:00) lisitsyn: well I can agree
 lisitsyn	(02:06:08) lisitsyn: but essentially that would be about putting manifests

 lambday_	lisitsyn: what does this Object class do?
 lisitsyn	lambday_: that's a base class to store paraemters
 lisitsyn	lambday_: it can store various parameters basically
 lambday_	lisitsyn: this looks cool (and pretty complex :D)
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I am afraid it is a long way yet
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I need to convince people it is not slow and it is reliable
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	not this implementation but that concept
 lambday_	hehe :D
 lambday_	you could write up on this on your blog...
 lambday_	explaining the idea
 lisitsyn	lambday_: yeah or github
 lisitsyn	blog would be better I guess
 lambday_	yeah on github you have to create issues
 lambday_	blog is better
 thoralf	wiking: We could also fix the macro SG_ERROR to include a "exit(1);" after the message, so the coverity detects that it's terminating the program. ;)
 thoralf	Working around the limitations. :)
 lambday_	lisitsyn: next massive task would be to splitting shogun into these libraries
 lisitsyn	lambday_: that would be pretty funny thing to do
 lambday_	things are pretty intertwined
 lambday_	lisitsyn: but it would have been really cool if we didn't have to include base classes in the core module
 lisitsyn	lambday_: why?
 lambday_	although don't know if that's possible
 lisitsyn	no I am pretty sure it is not
 lisitsyn	we need to keep something
 lisitsyn	otherwise interfaces would be ruined
 thoralf	wiking: Of better __coverity_panic__
 thoralf	Or
 lisitsyn	lambday_: ok thanks for your suggestion
 lisitsyn	I started big post on that
 lambday_	lisitsyn: yes please write the post :)
 lambday_	lisitsyn: btw can't help but asking - why 'aer' :P
 lisitsyn	lambday_: latin air :D
 lambday_	seriously? :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: yes
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I love latin
 lisitsyn	and well I like to give names to things
 lambday_	lol :D
 lisitsyn	this gives them soul I guess :D
 lambday_	haha
 lambday_	:D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I bet in your culture there should be something about soul of things
 lambday_	umm what are the compile time overloads? I mean this is all highly templated
 lambday_	lisitsyn: honestly I wouldn't know :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: it is compiled once
 lisitsyn	there is no real overload
 lisitsyn	well it is as overloaded as overloaded the set of base classes are
 lisitsyn	if we choose 100 classes as base
 lisitsyn	well I am sorry but that's 100+100 methods
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	100 getters and 100 setters
 lisitsyn	but once generated they are here and you don't care anymore
 lisitsyn	it is templated but they should be exported
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I guess I need to explain it pretty detailed :D
 lambday_	lisitsyn: yes please
 lambday_	:D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I feel people don't get what I am saying
 lambday_	I heard that it's a problem with with geniuses ;)
 lambday_	have you watched BBC Sherlock? :P
 lisitsyn	if I was that type it would explain
 lisitsyn	hmm actually yes a few episodes
 lisitsyn	not the last season though
 lisitsyn	I am now a big fan of 'person of interest'
 lambday_	not up to the mark but can't wait for 4th season
 lambday_	yeah heard that one is pretty hit
 lisitsyn	I want to build such thing they have in series
 lisitsyn	like 'machine' :D
 lambday_	hehe :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: they have some machine that does crazy surveillance
 lisitsyn	and the only thing I think about all the time
 lisitsyn	how to make it that scalable
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	lol :D
 lambday_	have to watch it them ;)
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I guess every programmer would think
 lambday_	the only programming related thing I saw was the movie antitrust..
 lisitsyn	normal people would say it is about private life
 lisitsyn	but no! I am pretty sure it is scalability :D
 lambday_	lol :D
 lisitsyn	who cares about privacy when it is not clear how to analyze these TBs of data
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	and they always skip that part! they will show you gazillions of HD stacks and fancy UI
 lisitsyn	lambday_: what about hackers? :D
 lambday_	yeah that one too.. but pretty old..
 lisitsyn	the hackers
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	you meant that sandra bullock starred one
 lisitsyn	lambday_: hmm I think it was
 lisitsyn	jolie
 lambday_	jolie was it!
 lisitsyn	I barely could remember her name
 lisitsyn	heh
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	that's crazy
 lambday_	you forgot jolie's name!! :D
 lisitsyn	they have been flying across some virtual city
 lisitsyn	makes no sense at all
 lisitsyn	probably director decided some letters would be boring
 lisitsyn	lambday_: it is much better in the 'person of interest'
 lambday_	antitrust is better from that perspetive :P
 lisitsyn	IIRC they had a phrase like that
 lambday_	yeah my friends are watching.. gotta watch :D
 lisitsyn	'to make it multithreaded use atomic variable'
 lambday_	hehe
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I like when they don't insult people with non-sense
 lisitsyn	like 'I build mega-firewall to find his TCP address'
 lambday_	hahahaha :D
 lisitsyn	this should be outlawed
 lambday_	sounds like DC comic's physics :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I am offended by 'the big bang theory'
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	lisitsyn: I am not.. I don't notice anything else except penny :D
 lisitsyn	I have more or less clear vision that such guys don't look like that
 lisitsyn	and don't act like that
 lisitsyn	I may be wrong but it looks stupid for me
 lambday_	lol I am offended by Raj's accent :D
 lisitsyn	hahah
 lambday_	he bloody dates a supermodel in real life!
 lambday_	not dates.. I guess married!
 lambday_	we deviated a lot from plugins, didn't we :-/
 thoralf	lol
 lisitsyn	lambday_: who cares?
 thoralf	lambday_: No.
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	haha :D
 lisitsyn	I like speaking about normal things
 thoralf	lambday_: https://xkcd.com/214/
* lambday_ raises his glass
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yes that's how it works
 lambday_	thoralf: wtf did I just see :D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: and well
 lisitsyn	you know any discussion leads to
 lisitsyn	...? who? :D
 lambday_	batman!
 lisitsyn	noo
 lambday_	sasha grey? :-/
 lisitsyn	noo
 lambday_	I'm out!
 lisitsyn	I googled for the name of the law, it is godwin's law
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	No.
 lisitsyn	hitler time haha
 thoralf	Godwin's law says you're losing anyway.
 lambday_	fuck! :D
 lisitsyn	sorry it is a law
 lambday_	I wonder how did he prove this :-/
 lambday_	super NLP stuffs on social media?
 thoralf	lambday_: He invented use net
 thoralf	lambday_: By experiment.
 lisitsyn	lambday_: well it is just like
 lisitsyn	you talk a lot and notice
 thoralf	lambday_: Every Hitler comparison ended up like this.
 lisitsyn	everything ends with hitler
 lambday_	lol
 lisitsyn	well lets just talk more
 lisitsyn	and we end with hitler
 thoralf	While falling afoul of Godwin's law tends to cause the individual making the comparison to lose his argument or credibility, Godwin's law itself can be abused as a distraction, diversion or even as censorship,  [...]
 lambday_	speaking of hitler, did you watch his reaction to Dexter's finale :D :D
 thoralf	(quote wikipedia)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Distraction.
 thoralf	Clearly.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: YOU lost credibility, but WE lost focus.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: haha
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hitler!
 lisitsyn	okay anytime from now
 lisitsyn	if I am tired receiving some messages from github issue
 lambday_	didn't we reach there already?
 lisitsyn	I just break in
 lisitsyn	say hitler
 lisitsyn	and that's it
 lambday_	that does it, no :D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Is this something like unsubscribe? ;)
 lisitsyn	or something more complex
 lisitsyn	'how dare are you to commit such fascist changes, are you a hitler or what?'
 lisitsyn	this would funny up the whole process
 thoralf	lisitsyn: No, it won't.
 thoralf	Has been tried in usenet several times, but never worked out.
 lisitsyn	haha
 thoralf	That's when Godwin came and wrote his law. :D
 thoralf	Proof.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: ok actually godwin's law is being used heavily now
 lisitsyn	by russian tv
 lisitsyn	thoralf: if you don't know the reason why we've taken crimea
 lisitsyn	well guess the name
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	I am serious now
 lambday_	you weren't before :D
 lambday_	?
 lisitsyn	no :D
 lisitsyn	I guess it works in other states
 lisitsyn	but it is heavily used now
 lisitsyn	and it works
 lisitsyn	lambday_: something completely different
 lambday_	lisitsyn: no idea! :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: is there anything like 'law of fish'
 lisitsyn	in indian culture?
 lambday_	lisitsyn: they swim.. we eat them... that's the law!
 lisitsyn	ok let me url you
 lisitsyn	lambday_:
 lisitsyn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pala_Empire
 lambday_	lisitsyn: its an album :'(
 lisitsyn	lambday_: find matsya nyaya
 lambday_	lisitsyn: ohhhh fuck I knew about that
 lisitsyn	matsya nyaya ("fish justice" i.e. a situation where the big fish eat the small fish)
 lambday_	read that in history books :D
 lambday_	matsya nyaya
 lisitsyn	lambday_: some sources refer that as some analogy
 lisitsyn	to law of the jungle
 lambday_	really??
 thoralf	Hakuna matatah?
 lisitsyn	like the most powerful creature f-cks them all
 lisitsyn	thoralf: sure
 lisitsyn	lambday_: so I am curious what's this thing :D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Are you drunk?
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I wish I was!
 lambday_	me too :(
 lisitsyn	why do you ask?
 lisitsyn	if you have something lets drink it together
 lambday_	count me in..
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I always act like drunk! live with that :D
 lambday_	lisitsyn: but I don't know why on earth they named it that way :D
 lambday_	but I love this sanskrit words :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: well I was close! your probability was better
 lambday_	fyi latin and sanskrit are actually sister languages - considering your fascination towards latin :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I have no idea how sanskrit relates to whatever
 lisitsyn	lambday_: oh well latin is cool yeah
 lambday_	I've heard that many words in latin are exactly similar to words in sanskrit
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Because you talked like drunk. ;)
 lambday_	like.. tell me the word for father in latin
 lisitsyn	hmm I can't remember that
 lambday_	pater
 lisitsyn	ahh probably pater
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lambday_	in sanskrit its pitr
 lambday_	:D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: it is often easy to understand latin words
 lisitsyn	they have some logic beneath
 lambday_	yeah man!
 lisitsyn	thoralf: always like that
 lambday_	I am talking from sanskrit's pt of view :D
 lambday_	no wonder they are extinct :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: correct me if I am wrong thoralf but it is fater in DE
 lambday_	fater?
 lisitsyn	lambday_: yeah I think so
 lisitsyn	mother is mutter in deutsch
 lisitsyn	you could knew that from rammstein
 lisitsyn	as any other german word
 lisitsyn	especially 1,2,3,..
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday_	hehe :D
 lisitsyn	ahh and everybody know how to speak 'left' in german due to that 'links' song
 lisitsyn	but not 'right' which is 'rechts' and not mentioned by rammstein :D
 lambday_	lol
 lambday_	I've only heard a few ... mein herz brennt and that song with a snake
 lambday_	engel
 lambday_	lisitsyn: man its 5.. I'm off to bed :D
 lisitsyn	lambday_: see ya
 lambday_	lisitsyn: 3 at your place
 lambday_	lisitsyn: ciao... gn :)

@besser82	thoralf, travis possibly reports sth. fully unrelated.  Maybe he's drunk.  :-P
 thoralf	besser82: It's always drunk.
 thoralf	Who cares about R?
 thoralf	Nobody?
@besser82	thoralf, noone ;)
 thoralf	Well, lets throw it out.
 thoralf	Gimme 3 minutes.
 thoralf	:D
@besser82	thoralf, ask sonney2k about that  ;)
@besser82	thoralf, you need that long?  ;)
 thoralf	Well, took so long because I decided not to fix it. :D

@wiking	thoralf: working with coverity?
@wiking	:P
 thoralf	Jo. :)
@wiking	cool
 thoralf	I'm abusing Travis for running the tests... sorry.
 thoralf	I just tried to fix some of the issues and will check Travis output later. ;)
 thoralf	But I *think* non of them *should* break.
 thoralf	Only fixed the ones that I (hopefully ;)) understood.
@wiking	heheh dont be sorry .... it's not me who travis can personally track down ;)
@wiking	remember they are in berlin :P
 thoralf	Damn.  Now it's in the logs.
