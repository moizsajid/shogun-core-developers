@iglesiasg	hello gsomix_
 gsomix_	iglesiasg, hi
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: I have a question you may know the answer for since you are working with reading of files and so on
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: do we have something in Shogun to read mat files from libshogun interface?
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.13] has joined #shogun
 gsomix_	iglesiasg, nope. but support Matlab's file format is in my project this summer.
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: I see! Then I will use it once you have done it :)

@HeikoS	lambday: you mean sparse matrix times sparse vector?
@HeikoS	lambday: sure good to have them
 lambday	HeikoS: yes
 lambday	alright :)
 lambday	HeikoS: how sparse are our probing vectors?
@HeikoS	lambday: I think quite sparse
@HeikoS	lambday: but no problems storing them in dense format
 lambday	HeikoS: then we used SGVector everywhere in the framework
 lambday	okay :D
@HeikoS	the matrix is the limiting factor
@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@HeikoS	wiking: yoyo how are things?
@wiking	HeikoS: well the clone tester is done... apart from the includes.... as i have to include all the headers in that clone_unittest.cc
@HeikoS	wiking: is that a problem?
@HeikoS	wiking: very cool that it finally is done :)
@HeikoS	wiking: there will be many errors revealed, lambday just found one a few days ago
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah it's not a problem i just have to add/modify the template generator python script
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@wiking	lambday: we should talk one day about the independentJob engine
@wiking	HeikoS: can u plz just push now those ipynb files you have into develop branch plz
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah trying to write some but found bugs
 lambday	HeikoS: absolutely :)
@HeikoS	wiking: but we can go for the ones from the talk for now
@HeikoS	wiking: give me a sec
@HeikoS	just finishing a blog post about the workshop
@wiking	HeikoS: that's alright... just put them there so i can work with them as well
@wiking	lambday: ping? :)
 lambday	wiking: pong :)
@wiking	or the 'absolutely' was meant for me? :)
 lambday	wiking: no no.. its regarding me and HeikoS discussing about the job engine :D
@HeikoS	lambday:  check the message again ;)
 lambday	wiking: HeikoS said that you guys had a really nice discussion regarding that, and I am really excited :D
 lambday	umm
@wiking	lambday: yeah i've written you just now about that we should talk about the 'independentJob engine'
@HeikoS	wiking: yes already told lambday that he will have to do it :D
@wiking	;)
 lambday	errrr
 lambday	:D
@HeikoS	there are loads of ideas
@wiking	cool
@HeikoS	we really should document them
@HeikoS	wiking: I was thinking of how to do this
@HeikoS	documenting ideas and maintaining them in a nice form so that starting to work on things will be easier
@HeikoS	github issues ?
@wiking	HeikoS: i've just went through the commited code and it's looking interesting...
@HeikoS	wiking: commited code?
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I see
@wiking	HeikoS: src/shogun/lib/computation/*
@HeikoS	for the engine and stuff
@HeikoS	yeah, its still a draft, but I think it will get us somewhere
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: we really need clone for that btw
@wiking	that's a good starter for sure
@wiking	HeikoS: hehe noted.... i'm working on the script just now
@HeikoS	wiking: but for clone, we should change some things in the parameter framework as its currently a bit annoying
@wiking	so let's say 30 mins and you'll have a commit
@wiking	with a working clone&&equals test
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, I gotta go to work soon but will be back later today
@HeikoS	wiking: clone wont work for some classes, but its good to detect that
@HeikoS	wiking: in fact, it would be good if the automated unit tests would be ran with valgrind
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i thought so
@HeikoS	to make sure there is absolutely not problem
@wiking	HeikoS: well that's just another command... remember?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes I do, is it possible to always run them with valgrind on travis?
@wiking	HeikoS: make valgrind-per-module in tests/unit
@HeikoS	and to complain when there are problems
@HeikoS	since for the developer written ones its not that important
@HeikoS	but the automated ones should be clean
@wiking	HeikoS: yes it is i have to add a new target for that in ./src/Makefile
@wiking	but that shouldn't take long
@wiking	HeikoS: btw -Werror is not a good idea
@HeikoS	wiking: or maybe run all of them with and without valgrind then we know whats happening
-!- nube [~rho@49.244.75.145] has joined #shogun
@wiking	HeikoS: clang flags are really not right with ./configure
@wiking	so i suggest to remove -Werror from unit tests
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah maybe you are right, what happening
@wiking	until we dont get cmake ready
@HeikoS	wiking: go ahead
@wiking	HeikoS: i'll do that with the patch for the clone + equal unit test commmit
 lambday	HeikoS: wiking: many unit-tests use eigen and its full of warnings...
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@HeikoS	lambday, wiking I see
@wiking	HeikoS: i think we should do this after we switched to cmake... as that'll improve some of our custom generated compiler flags with ./configure
@HeikoS	wiking: okay cool
@HeikoS	looking forward to cmake
@wiking	HeikoS: heheh that requires still quite some hacking
@HeikoS	wiking: we need more manpower!! :)
@wiking	HeikoS: commit + push the ipynb that you have
@wiking	NOW
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	wiking: directory?
@HeikoS	examples?
@HeikoS	or doc?
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm we've agreed that it should be documentation
@wiking	or docs
@HeikoS	wiking: so in doc there is tutorial
@HeikoS	wiking: which is the latex stuff
@wiking	ah yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: Ill create ipython-notebooks under doc
@wiking	fair enough
@HeikoS	wiking: cleaning notwbooke
@HeikoS	notebooks
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm i think we either should rely on jinja2 or cheetah for template generation
@wiking	they are both very well documented and already tested python libraries
@wiking	indeed jinja2 is used by ipython-notebook

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #1248 from karlnapf/develop
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: initial add of three notebooks
@wiking	cool!
@HeikoS	wiking: ok sounds good
@HeikoS	wiking: here you go
@wiking	HeikoS: maybe depending on jinja2 would be less of a pain
@wiking	HeikoS: as one would need that for ipython notebooks anyways
@HeikoS	wiking: yep, so what exactly do you want to use from them?
@wiking	although it's a bit a strong requirement that one not only needs google test and mock framework for unit testing but a python lib as well, or?
@wiking	HeikoS: well jinja2 is just a template engine
@wiking	HeikoS: it's mainly used for html templates... but there's nothing stopping us to use it for generating c++ code in unit testing
@wiking	or?
@wiking	HeikoS: because now i've started to hack together our own template engine... but it pretty much feels to be reinventing the wheel
@wiking	HeikoS: it'll be full of bugs and it's just going to work for one and only one purpose... while those 2 python libs i've mentioned are pretty stable and well tested and general purpose....
@wiking	HeikoS: so we can do all sorts of hacks with them....
@HeikoS	wiking: that sounds pretty awesome
@wiking	HeikoS: and as said... if you have ipython (notebook) you'll have jinja2 installed
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean unit tests are for devs
@HeikoS	wiking: so the dependency is fine
@HeikoS	not for users
@HeikoS	wiking, lambday running of to work now, see you later

 foulwall`	ping lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	foulwall`: hey
 lisitsyn	what's up?
@wiking	lisitsyn: what'sup man :) you wanished like thin air. but congratz for your paper!
 lisitsyn	wiking: haha yes I kinda vanished
 lisitsyn	thanks
 lisitsyn	wiking: will try to get to cmake stuff soon!
 lisitsyn	we've got to finish that
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah that's like prio -1 ;)
 foulwall`	hey lisitsyn , I planed to make a dimention reduction demo this week, any suggestions?
 foulwall`	congratz lisitsyn!
 lisitsyn	foulwall`: yes sure I have a few suggestions
 lisitsyn	I think the general approach would be
 lisitsyn	take a set of images
 lisitsyn	of the same size
 lisitsyn	put them directly to feature matrix (one image per row), just flattened pixels
 lisitsyn	then use some converter with target dimension = 2
 lisitsyn	and scatterplot it with images instead of points
 foulwall`	like the demos in http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me/ ?
 lisitsyn	foulwall`: yeah exaclty
 foulwall`	gotcha, lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	foulwall`: however my mnist example is not done this way
 lisitsyn	iirc I had some problems with displaying images
 lisitsyn	would be nice if you overcome that trouble
 lisitsyn	ahhh I remember
 lisitsyn	it gets too slow!
 foulwall`	oh, noticed that.
 lisitsyn	we should think about it
 lisitsyn	foulwall`: what you can do is downsample images
 lisitsyn	like to 20 x 20 or sth like that
 lisitsyn	may be it gets better this way
@wiking	fuck it's too hot here :)
 foulwall`	ok thanks!
 lisitsyn	wiking: where are you?
@wiking	zagreb
@wiking	croatia
 lisitsyn	oh travelling
 lisitsyn	wiking: when you are back?
@wiking	to?
@wiking	this is my new home :)
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	really?
@wiking	yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: what about belgium?
@wiking	for some months not
@wiking	*now
@wiking	i've moved out
@wiking	no more belgium for me
 lisitsyn	what about phd?
@wiking	well i'm now writing the thesis
@wiking	but as my funding just ended 2 days ago
@wiking	i'm not living there anymore
 lisitsyn	oh I see
 lisitsyn	so what's next?
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	now it's writing my thesis
@wiking	after that i have no idea
@wiking	i'm currently unemployed :D
@wiking	should apply for unemployment :P
 lisitsyn	hahaha
@wiking	coding shogun for food
@wiking	:P
 lisitsyn	but why zagreb?
@wiking	lisitsyn: my wife had to be here coz of her job
 lisitsyn	I remember you said you have some place in budapest?
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	that's what I would ask next
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	what does she do?
@wiking	stop motion animation
 lisitsyn	cool
@wiking	now working on her own movie...
 lisitsyn	like in matrix?
@wiking	matrix? :)
 lisitsyn	the matrix movie
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion
 lisitsyn	ahah
 lisitsyn	I confused it
 lisitsyn	you know with some like baaam bullets
@wiking	aaah
@wiking	no
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	sloow bullets flying around
@wiking	heheh nono
 lisitsyn	interesting thing!
@wiking	anyhow i'm now having trouble with autogen stuff
@wiking	any ideas why would this be happening:
