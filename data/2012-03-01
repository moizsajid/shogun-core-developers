 bais	I have just found the CustomKernel class, that should help!

 Karl-London	Hi. I'm a Shogun beginner and I'm trying to run some examples in Octave (modular).
 Karl-London	The problem is, the data directory is missing. Could someone please tell me where the data directory is? Or send me the data?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 Karl-London	Could someone please send me the data file: label_train_twoclass.dat, fm_train_real.dat and fm_test_real.dat ?
 Karl-London	My email is: ksh309@gmail.com       Many thanks for your help!
 n4nd0	Karl-London: hey!
 n4nd0	Karl-London: you can download them from the github repo
 n4nd0	Karl-London: you can find the files you want here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data/tree/master/toy
 n4nd0	Karl-London: but you may be interested also in getting a local clone of the repo :)
 Karl-London	Got it! That's great. Thank you very much for your help!
 n4nd0	Karl-London: no problem, you are welcome

 bais	hi
 bais	i'm having a problem using SVMs in the octave modular interface
 bais	when I try executing the train() method it simply prints "sorry not yet implemented"
 bais	The question at this point might be stupid, but does this mean there is not way of using SVMs with octave right now?!
 bais	should i maybe be using the LibSVM class?
 bais	it seems like the SVM class is just an interface to actual classes like LibSVM..

 sonne|work	bais: yes SVM is just the baseclass
 sonne|work	use any of its child-classes http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CSVM.html
 sonne|work	wiking: have a look at the updated ideas list - vojtech's libqp has some more detailled descr. now
 wiking	sonne|work: hey! cool i'll check i've had one email exchange with vojtech. he said that he's going to be pretty busy so i'll have to be independent but that's fine by me
 sonne|work	he has a great plan now I think
 sonne|work	just look at it (I recall that this and the latent svm where of interest to you)
 wiking	yep
 wiking	i think
 wiking	although it's a bit much but there could be a great way to do them both
 wiking	i mean creating nice interface for libqp within shogun
 wiking	and use libqp for the latent svm
 wiking	that'd be great
 wiking	since now some of the latent svm 'implementations' use mosek
 wiking	hmm that reminds me i should clean up my latest patch and submit a pull request ;P
 bais	sonne|work: yes thanks I am finally making my way through the documentation in a more ordered way :P Although, I cannot find some form of description of the various classes, like what would be the difference between using LightSVM and SVMLib, and such..
 sonne|work	yeah that is missing
 sonne|work	^ bais
 sonne|work	some more documentation is certainly needed in particular when people don't want to google 'libsvm' 'svmlight' etc
 sonne|work	wiking: well it depends if you intend to sleep
 sonne|work	and of course if you want to stick around after gsoc ... in the end gsoc is just 3 months
 wiking	sonne|work: hahaha well it's part of my phd
 wiking	soooo
 wiking	i mean i'm not doing this for gsoc
 wiking	it's for myself and my phd
 sonne|work	well then just start the work :D
 wiking	yep
 wiking	i'd just like to talk about it with somebody
 wiking	so that you guys get something in a form you'd like to see it
 wiking	so everybody wins :P
 sonne|work	I havent read the latentsvm papers but I can very well imagine what it does and that the resulting problem is non-convex
 wiking	yep
 sonne|work	but in the end it is just an SVM :)
 wiking	currently that's why i'm trying out other optimizers
 wiking	but yep.. essentially it's an sum :)
 wiking	*svm
 sonne|work	wiking: what about http://opencv.itseez.com/trunk/modules/objdetect/doc/latent_svm.html
 wiking	lesse
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i know the opencv based one
 wiking	it's very very specific
 sonne|work	wiking: do you want to do that for linear svms?
 sonne|work	I mean linear latent svm
 sonne|work	(I just had a look at the paper)
 wiking	well afaik the latent svm that joachim's student did was linear... he haven't made the kernel extension of it...
 sonne|work	kernel would be too slow
 sonne|work	so then we need hog and lbp features and then live is good :)
 bais	sonne|work: oh ok i didnt figure out they were external references to the project, i thought they were internal stuff like "KernelMachine" or such
 sonne|work	bais: yeah we use other people's code if we can...
 bais	ok well, thanks
-!- bais [~bais@n136-p64.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 sonne|work	wiking: certainly quite some effort to get things to work...
 sonne|work	can be as hard a general structured output learning (HM-SVM)
 wiking	nyiha
 wiking	i haven't even knew about HM-SVM
 wiking	let me check what's that thingy :)
 wiking	apart from being a hidden markov -svm :)))
 sonne|work	it is frequently used in vision/text/bioinformatics to segment things
 sonne|work	e.g. dna into genes/non-genes
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	shogun has it? :)
 wiking	or it's only implemented in hm-svm toolbox
 sonne|work	well shogun has the argmax but no more
 sonne|work	one of the projects is to get hm-svm toolbox back into shogun
 sonne|work	with some nice design though
 sonne|work	code quality is not so good in that part...
 sonne|work	^wiking
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i'll give it a look
 sonne|work	wiking: well, choose what you are most interesting in / what does motivate you to do most :)

 n4nd0	blackburn: how is it going?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey, fine, what about you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: fine too
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am taking a look to the gsoc ideas at the webpage
 blackburn	and what do you think about it?
 n4nd0	I think they are really interesting in general
 n4nd0	I find quite appealing the one of structured output
 n4nd0	but being honest, it may be a bit out of scope for my knowledge right now
 n4nd0	a bit too out of scope :P
 blackburn	well I didn't know anything about dimreduction last year when I did a lot of dimreduction :)
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	I thought you had done sth with it before maybe in a math course or the like
 n4nd0	you are working in multitask right?
 blackburn	will be working on MT, yeah
 n4nd0	the first one about writing tutorials and documentation looks nice too
 n4nd0	is that a priority for shogun?
 blackburn	well probably most interesting and important idea, yeah
 n4nd0	yeah, that one looks good definetely
 n4nd0	it can be a good way to learn the fundamentals so later (post-gsoc) one can continue with more advanced stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: anyhow, do you have any other idea do work on in the meantime?
 blackburn	well.. not really
 blackburn	let me think about it
 blackburn	n4nd0: maybe QDA?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it sounds almost like LDA :P
 n4nd0	I guess they must be related to each other
 blackburn	yes, but no code for QDA here :)
 n4nd0	I will take a look to it then
 n4nd0	do you know something it is applied for?
 blackburn	not really, but we are general-purpose ML lib
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	I just wondered :P
 blackburn	may be spectral clustering
 blackburn	btw spectral clustering is a very simple task
 blackburn	one need to just combine ready KMeans and LaplacianEigenmaps
 n4nd0	is it used for dimensionality reduction?
 blackburn	spectral clusterin is used for clustering, but it uses laplacian eigenmaps
 blackburn	simply it is kmeans in laplacian eigenmaps domain
