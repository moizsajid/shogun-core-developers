 guiniol	HeikoS: what exactly do you want to see for the error? I usually just get a segfault
@HeikoS	guiniol: thats enough but your system specs are important
@HeikoS	guiniol: we migth ask you to print debugging symbols
@HeikoS	but that later
 guiniol	ok
 guiniol	I tried with the develop branch this morning and I get a "ImportError: bad magic number in 'modshogun': b'\x03\xf3\r\n'"
 guiniol	my cmake was: 'cmake .. -DPythonModular=ON  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local'
 guiniol	by system specs, you mean the python version, gcc version, etc?
 guiniol	what else would be needed?
 guiniol	HeikoS: issue #2851 opened
@HeikoS	guiniol: thanks, I wil lcheck soon
 guiniol	sure
 guiniol	no worries
 CaBa	good CEST-morning :)
 CaBa	well... noon :P
 CaBa	aka my morning :P

 CaBa	is the develop branch supposed to build? :P
@wiking	CaBa: yes
 CaBa	wiking: interesting. doesn't seem to for me...
 CaBa	http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=z3aW73wT
@wiking	oooooh
@wiking	that is most interesting
@wiking	CaBa: i've just ran
@wiking	a build and it was good
@wiking	:S

 CaBa	wiking: on what system? what compiler?
 CaBa	wiking: seems to work with GNU..
 CaBa	wiking: hm. not. compiling works with GNU, however, linking the library doesn't. missing symbols from google::protobuf
 CaBa	wiking: are you missing a dependency in the cmake file there?
 CaBa	actually protobuf is there...
 CaBa	ok, my mistake, i was building 4.0.0 with gcc... building HEAD doesn't work with GNU either
 CaBa	ok, same trouble no matter what... building 4.0.0 works with clang, not with GNU (linker fails with protobuf), building from git doesn't work with either GNU or clang, both failing with errors in base/Version.cpp
 CaBa	wiking: the python segfault issue is now described under #2852

 ephas	Hi, has anyone got any examples for feature selection using the Python interface?
 CaBa	there is no dynamically linked cmdline interface that i could use to test the dylib, right?
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@laptop-net.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
@besser82	CaBa, cmdline interface links dynamicly
@besser82	CaBa, it's called "static", because interface-code is hand-written
@besser82	CaBa, and not generated during build  ;)
 CaBa	besser82: ok. in that case, my dylib seems to work, since the cmdline works, too
 CaBa	besser82: thus, i really seem to have a problem with the python binding in particular
 CaBa	besser82: just wanted to verify whether my dylib is functional. thanks for the clarification
@besser82	CaBa, np. you're welcome
@besser82	CaBa, You are on Mac, rye?
 CaBa	besser82: yes, here's my trouble: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2852
 CaBa	is there no documentation for RealFeatures?
@besser82	CaBa, sry... I unfortunately cannot help you really with Mac-related issues...  :(
 CaBa	besser82: no problem... i'm playing around on a linux vm as long as it doesn't work on the mac...
@besser82	CaBa, Try fedora, if you don't need svm^light urgently
@besser82	CaBa, everything works out of box in there
@besser82	CaBa, so you can install everything through package-manager
 CaBa	besser82: already have my testbed running on debian right now, so far i'm good
@besser82	CaBa, okie  =)
 CaBa	besser82: what's the idea of left-hand and right-hand side features passed to kernels?
@besser82	CaBa, erm... no idea...  :/
@besser82	CaBa, I'm basically into SVM
 CaBa	besser82: well i'm talking about SVM kernels
 CaBa	besser82: for example the GaussianKernel() constructor takes two features objects - left and right
@besser82	CaBa, Ahh... I see...  :P
@besser82	CaBa, That is if you have two describing (similar) models and want to get the linear output between them, e.g.
@besser82	or on of those models is finer grained and you want to improve prediction-output of the other one
@besser82	you can use the finer-grained left-hand and the other one right-hand then

 CaBa	besser82: hm. if that's not the case i just pass the same features twice?
@besser82	CaBa, or just right-hand
