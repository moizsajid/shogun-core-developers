@wiking	lisitsyn: yo
@wiking	here?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 lisitsyn	whazup
@wiking	lisitsyn: ok so we've got disconnected
@wiking	what would i need to still do
@wiking	for the new web/
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: ahh
 lisitsyn	nginx: listen 8200, redirect to 8201
 lisitsyn	dns: add beta.shogun.ml -> the same thing as shogun.ml
@wiking	done
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'll do the beta thing
 lisitsyn	thanks
@wiking	sonne|work: ^ i guess you have the access to add subdomain for shogun-toolbox.org
@wiking	ok
@wiking	host beta.shogun.ml                                                                                                                    [wiking@rdr:~/shogun-build]
@wiking	beta.shogun.ml is an alias for shogun.ml.
@wiking	shogun.ml has address 94.23.237.10
@wiking	this works
@wiking	i'll try to handle the thing in pound
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	wiking: http://beta.shogun.ml works
 lisitsyn	opens old version though
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	need to fix it in
@wiking	pound i guess
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah or maybe in nginx directly
 lisitsyn	via server_name
@wiking	that's not enough
@wiking	as the request comes into pound
@wiking	just a sec i think i got it
 lisitsyn	yeah true
@wiking	restarting
@wiking	i think it works
@wiking	or?
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	it shows some crazy thing for me
@wiking	a fish
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	yes
@wiking	that's no good? :)
 lisitsyn	probably
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	no idea where it comes from
@wiking	okok the uwsgi is on already?
 shogun-buildbot	build #1093 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/1093
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes site is running
@wiking	ok debugging
 lisitsyn	ah there is no curl on that machine
@wiking	u want?
 lisitsyn	wiking: can you install?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	just to check
@wiking	done
@wiking	ok not yet
@wiking	done
@wiking	sudo ps aux|grep wsg
@wiking	wiking    7470  0.0  0.0  10180   884 pts/0    S+   09:40   0:00 grep wsg
@wiking	i dont see uwsgi running
 lisitsyn	wiking: nah there is just embedded flask
 lisitsyn	wiking: curl localhost:8201 shows it
@wiking	buti dont see the process at all
@wiking	ok i see
 lisitsyn	6804
 lisitsyn	wiking: ^
@wiking	i redirect in pound the Host: .*beta.(shogun-toolbox.org|sgtb.eu|shogun.ml).*
@wiking	to localhost:8200
@wiking	and that should redirect stuff to this
@wiking	i mean nginx -> uwsgi
 lisitsyn	wiking: localhost:8200 shows the fish..
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	ok i'll try pound directly to 8201
@wiking	done
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	ok i guess then i can remove the stuff
@wiking	in nginx
@wiking	or?
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh
 lisitsyn	gosh
@wiking	because this goes directly to the uwsgi thingy
 lisitsyn	wiking: there is already a rule for 8200
 lisitsyn	that's why we see the fish
@wiking	where?
 lisitsyn	wiking: grep -R 8200 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
@wiking	/etc/nginx/sites-available/strongm.ath.cx:listen   127.0.0.1:8200;
@wiking	lol
@wiking	ok
@wiking	changing then
@wiking	8210
 lisitsyn	wiking: I'd keep it in nginx for now
 lisitsyn	wiking: IIRC there is some wsgi thing for nginx
 lisitsyn	but not for pound
@wiking	restarting pound
@wiking	ok works
@wiking	now it's pound -> nginx -> uwsgi
 lisitsyn	good
 lisitsyn	no uwsgi though
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	yet
@wiking	ok anyhow this one is ok :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah thanks
 lisitsyn	now I can start setting up this thing with git-deploy
@wiking	ok i've placed latest cookbook here
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/
@wiking	something is wrong though :P
 lisitsyn	wiking: no css I guess
@wiking	nono
@wiking	it's worse
@wiking	chmod problmes
@wiking	:)
@wiking	see it's fixed now
@wiking	mmm i need to figure out how search works
@wiking	as currently it doesn't work
@wiking	:<
 lisitsyn	wiking: btw
 lisitsyn	what about https?
 lisitsyn	can we switch to that?
@wiking	yeah sure
@wiking	but where and how we get
@wiking	a good pem
@wiking	i mean cert
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am not sure
@wiking	because without that
@wiking	https doesn't make tooo much sense
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes true
 lisitsyn	I am completely n00b in these deals
 lisitsyn	I have no idea where people get certificates
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	well pay for them
@wiking	usually
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	that's what I know
@wiking	but i'll check out if there's somebody who's doing it for free
@wiking	startssl
@wiking	was somebody llike that
@wiking	and their cert was included in most browsers
 lisitsyn	letsencrypt

 sanuj	wiking: there?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	dunno who's failing
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking: okay, i'm checking it on my local
@HeikoS	wiking: jojo
@HeikoS	sanuj: no mistakes!
@HeikoS	sanuj: its good to iterate over patches for a bit
@HeikoS	especially in the beginning
@HeikoS	more important to respond nicely to this, and learn what we have in mind
@HeikoS	how can you know it before we tell you? :)
 sanuj	HeikoS: hey
 sanuj	:)
@HeikoS	checking the PR
 sanuj	HeikoS: i never complained about the reiterations...just trying to make less mistakes ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: sup?
@HeikoS	sanuj: what I mean is that you should not worry about these "mistakes" they are part of th learning process -- so all good
@wiking	what's still missing?
@HeikoS	wiking: wazuup
@HeikoS	wiking: missing for?
@wiking	i think i need fix for the stupid ipython notebook generation
@HeikoS	wiking: ah yes
@HeikoS	the website is currently empty
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool :)
@HeikoS	wiking: what about a buildbot without lapack and without c++11?
@HeikoS	wiking: oh one thing is important
@wiking	mmm that's not easy
@HeikoS	the viennacl bot
@wiking	that's fixed
@HeikoS	has to install python-ply
 sanuj	HeikoS: next cookbook page coming up -- kernel ridge regression
@HeikoS	ah thanks!
@HeikoS	sanuj: nice looking forward
@HeikoS	wiking: we should also add a memcheck of the meta examples
@HeikoS	at least the cpp ones
@wiking	mmm
 sanuj	HeikoS: i need to talk to you about rff and linear ridge regression
@wiking	if they are part
@HeikoS	sanuj: sure
@wiking	of tests
@HeikoS	wiking: they are
@wiking	then it should be
@HeikoS	ah ok
@wiking	or at least i hope
@wiking	ok i'm still IO-ing
@HeikoS	wiking: ah yes
@wiking	there's plenty of stuff to refactor there
@HeikoS	so noe meta integration tests depend on serialization
@HeikoS	and CSVFile
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	they are working more or less
@wiking	the problem is that with a normal size dataset
@wiking	it's dev/null
@HeikoS	wiking: yes definitely
 sanuj	HeikoS: rff is derived form CRandomKitchenSinksDotFeatures which is from dotfeatures
 sanuj	HeikoS: but linear ridge regression works with dense features till now
@HeikoS	wiking: what about a nightly binary shogun docker?
 sanuj	HeikoS: so i have 3 options
@HeikoS	wiking: and is the ppa working on latest dev?
 sanuj	HeikoS: 1) change rff
@HeikoS	wiking: these two would be cool to have I guess
 sanuj	HeikoS: 2) change linear ridge regression
@HeikoS	sanuj: it doesnt really make sense to derive the rff from dot features
@HeikoS	not at all in fact
 sanuj	HeikoS: 3) and the easiest one is to make a new regression class which works with dot features
 sanuj	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	since the idea in these approx kernel methods is to solve problems in their primal form
@HeikoS	which means in an explicit feature space
 sanuj	HeikoS: so i need to refactor rff?

@HeikoS	sanuj: if you can find out how there are used in the dot-features form (if they are at all), that would be useful before you start
-!- BurningBear [~zpcxh95@121.237.188.207] has joined #shogun
@wiking	HeikoS: nigbhtly binary shogun docker?
@HeikoS	definitely also checkout how scikit does it interface wise
@wiking	HeikoS: what that would be?
@HeikoS	wiking: sorry I was not precise
@wiking	HeikoS: the ppa as i told you needs much more work on cmake
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean a docker image where shogun binaries are installed
@wiking	HeikoS: that requires ppa
@HeikoS	wiking: ah yes
@wiking	tyou dont want to build shogun
@wiking	in a docker
@HeikoS	so docker image can just install ppa rather than building it
@HeikoS	I guess thats best
@wiking	i mean at least you dont want
@wiking	to have it distributed
@HeikoS	and the ppa, what exactly is missing?
@wiking	i've started something in config branch
@wiking	that needs finishing :)
 sanuj	HeikoS: coool
@HeikoS	sanuj: had two more minor comments, then we can merge
@HeikoS	wiking: I see :)
@HeikoS	too many things
@HeikoS	wiking: next thing for me is the website
@HeikoS	wiking: I added lots of issues and will try to put them in now
@HeikoS	wiking: I can now push to the web2 repo and the beta.shogun.ml is updated right?
 sanuj	HeikoS: updating the PR
@wiking	HeikoS: should be able to
@wiking	dunno
@HeikoS	wiking: kk
@HeikoS	wiking: what should be addressed next in your eyes?
@HeikoS	wiking: btw what about we aim for this c++11 thing next year?
@HeikoS	wiking: and what about putting a deprecated warning in the next release?
@wiking	i'm trying to fix the notebooks
 sanuj	HeikoS: updated the pr :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: checking
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm i'd be carefull with that see rhel6
@wiking	it's 2020+
@HeikoS	sanuj: does make test time out for you locally?
@HeikoS	sanuj: I will merge now, but waiting for travis to be green
@HeikoS	sanuj: nice we now have the second notebook page :)
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah, let's wait for travis
 sanuj	make test runs all the tests on my laptop
 sanuj	3 fail
 sanuj	and i get this error
 sanuj	Errors while running CTest make: *** [test] Error 8
 sanuj	everytime
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'nightly_default'

 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@HeikoS	sanuj: which tests fail?
 sanuj	python_modular-evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_storage
 sanuj	python_modular-serialization_complex_example
 sanuj	python_modular-features_string_char_compressed_modular
 sanuj	HeikoS: they fail every time
@HeikoS	sanuj: these are not related to your patch
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: probably some missing lib
@HeikoS	ignore them
@HeikoS	all these will go away soon anyways, when we have meta integration tests for all examples
@HeikoS	I gotta run now
@HeikoS	will merge your cookbook later tonight
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool
