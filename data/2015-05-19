 MLnerd84	hi there.  is there anyone here that can answer a question about crossvalidation in shogun?
 MLnerd84	Hello?
@besser82	Hey! What do you excatly need to know?
@besser82	*exactly
 MLnerd84	So i'm doing CV on a simple libSVM instance using the python modular interface
 MLnerd84	And I can perform the CV just fine, and get the result object out.
@besser82	allrighty, so far...  but?
 MLnerd84	But it seems the only way I can see the result is with the print_result method.
 MLnerd84	Is there any way to get at that number without using std out?  I'd like to be able to use that value for doing feature selection
 MLnerd84	but if I'm constantly having to scrape std out, that's a huge pain
 lisitsyn	you need to get like evaluation score that you've got?
 MLnerd84	it seems like the evaluationresult object has a .mean property, but I can't acess it in the python interface
 MLnerd84	Yes
@besser82	You should be able to assign the result to a Numpy array / matrix and use it from there...
@besser82	lemme check...
 MLnerd84	How?
 MLnerd84	ok
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	so you get evaluationresult
 lisitsyn	but it should be crossvalidationresult
 MLnerd84	Right
 lisitsyn	okie easy
 lisitsyn	CrossValidationResult.obtain_from_generic(your_result)
 lisitsyn	do that
 MLnerd84	ok, let me check if that works
 lisitsyn	it will return a CrossValidationResult thing from there
 lisitsyn	mean should be accessible then
 MLnerd84	Boom.  That did it.
 MLnerd84	Thanks
@besser82	lisitsyn, you've been faster...
@besser82	MLnerd84, I don't use Python that much...  :P
 MLnerd84	Ha.  To each their own.
 lisitsyn	python power
 MLnerd84	Thank you very much for the assistance
 MLnerd84	snakes and whitespace forever :-P
 lisitsyn	welcome :)
@besser82	lisitsyn, better step ya game up on da C++  :P
 lisitsyn	can't encode character u'\blabla'
 lisitsyn	99% of python with unicode
@besser82	lisitsyn, use da wchar*

 lisitsyn	besser82: unicode in python is like craziest part
 lisitsyn	once you get to russian/anything_unicode you get weird errors
@besser82	I heard about that, lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	besser82: related pic http://i45.tinypic.com/znlxqb.png
 lisitsyn	besser82: the main troubles of python programmer
 lisitsyn	testing, writing code, design, unicode :D
@besser82	Then choose "???????? ?????" and don't use da "???????" in strings...  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	besser82: not possible ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, Y?
@besser82	??? can't read english?  :P
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have millions search queries to handle and they are all in russian ;)
@besser82	then read the shiats as int and memcmp  :P
@besser82	uint16_t[]  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is not a problem without solution to handle these strings
@besser82	?
 lisitsyn	but you always get unexpected error like that you have to fix again and again
 lisitsyn	like you forgot to encode/decode
@besser82	That's pretty shitty...
