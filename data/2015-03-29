@HeikoS	nileshK: hi
@HeikoS	nileshK: how are things with the lpboost?
 nileshK	Yeah. I trying to get something working on lpboost
 nileshK	Since now I have got it compiling, I am trying to figure out how to create a toy example
 nileshK	which will just act a proof of concept and add it to the examples set
@HeikoS	okok
@HeikoS	nileshK: the error you got seems to be of a different source
 nileshK	"different source"? I dont think I understand this
 nileshK	Also, I needed your help on one more thing

 nileshK	Hello anybody there
 nileshK	wiking:?
 nileshK	lisitsyn:?
@lisitsyn	nileshK: yes
 nileshK	I was a bit doubtful regarding the implementation of LpBoost that Shogun has
 nileshK	Does it really work?
 nileshK	And has it been tested?
@lisitsyn	nileshK: ohh its pretty old
@lisitsyn	I think it was tested somehow
@lisitsyn	nileshK: sonney2k_ is the man to ask actually
 nileshK	I need some help in getting an example of it working.
 nileshK	Can you help me right now?
 nileshK	He doesnt seem to be be online now.
@lisitsyn	I can try
 nileshK	So, see LpBoost is inherited from a class CLinearMachine
@lisitsyn	yes
 nileshK	But it doesnot have a constructed implemented which can accept the data
@lisitsyn	what data?
 nileshK	as in for that matter even SVMOcas is also inherited from CLinearMachine
@lisitsyn	yes they are all linear
 nileshK	data => training set
 nileshK	CSVMOcas* lin_svm = new CSVMOcas(C, rf_feats, labels);
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	that's ok
@lisitsyn	just do set_features
 nileshK	Also regarding doing the set_features thing
 nileshK	is there a specfic format in which the training data has to be presented
 nileshK	Just to clarify my point what kind of data files can I use with LpBoost
 nileshK	from the shogun-data that I downloaded
@lisitsyn	as far as I can see LpBoost requires sparse features
 nileshK	Yeah. so how do I proceed
@lisitsyn	what language are you using shogun in?
 nileshK	I am using C++
@lisitsyn	ok I see
@lisitsyn	you need to construct CSparseFeatures https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/features/SparseFeatures.h
@lisitsyn	you can create sgsparsematrix or sgmatrix
@lisitsyn	or load it from file
 nileshK	ok. Assuming I created the CSparseFeatures
 nileshK	The next step would be to the train function?
@lisitsyn	yeah you just create CLpBoost thing
@lisitsyn	call set_features(<your features>)
@lisitsyn	call set_labels(<your labels>)
@lisitsyn	and train
 nileshK	ok.
 nileshK	I will try this and get back to you
 nileshK	Till what time will you be online?
@lisitsyn	nileshK: whole day but can disappear for some moments :)
 nileshK	Ok. I might require your help for small issues I might stuck into. :)
 nileshK	Thanks a lot!
 nileshK	I will ping you after trying this
@lisitsyn	nileshK: sure

 nileshK	lisitsyn: Hi
@lisitsyn	nileshK: hey
 nileshK	I was checking this file out: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/applications/classification/random_fourier_classification.cpp
 nileshK	It had an example of reading sparefeatures
@lisitsyn	ah yeah
@lisitsyn	it uses libsvm
 nileshK	but can you point me to a dataset that could be read via that function
 nileshK	Please check the load_data function
@lisitsyn	just a second
@lisitsyn	nileshK: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
@lisitsyn	these should work
 nileshK	Ok. I will try and get back. Thanks :)
 nileshK	Lisitsyn: The dataset worked correctly.
 nileshK	I was trying to modify the code to generate an example for lpBoost on lines with this code
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Jw49xhzS
 nileshK	This code I have adapted from teh random_fourier_classfication
 nileshK	It is compiling well for me
 nileshK	g++ lpBoost_classfication.cpp -lshogun -L/home/nilesh/shogun-install/lib -I/home/nilesh/shogun-install/include
 nileshK	I am using this data set
 nileshK	http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#a1a
 nileshK	a1a
 nileshK	But on executing with this command :
 nileshK	./a.out --dataset ../../data/a1a
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/FvO1kxdk
@lisitsyn	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/nilesh/shogun-install/lib
@lisitsyn	then try that again
 nileshK	Bingo!
 nileshK	Worked.
@lisitsyn	nileshK: cool :) hope lpboost works as well
 nileshK	Yeah I am now adding the testing part to it.
 nileshK	Let me see how that goes through

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: around?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi how are things?
@HeikoS	feeling better?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah much better :)
@lisitsyn	thanks
@lisitsyn	what about you?
@HeikoS	yeah same
@HeikoS	parents are visiting in London
@HeikoS	thats fun
@lisitsyn	cool
@HeikoS	hey I wanted to ask aobut the manual stuff
@HeikoS	want to keep that going
@HeikoS	whats needed?
@lisitsyn	well you know I didn't approach that since then
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	I didnt know
@HeikoS	?
@lisitsyn	hmm well
@HeikoS	shall we try to tackle the html thingi now?
@lisitsyn	I am not sure I can do that now but I can try tomorrow
@lisitsyn	the thing is that we would need our own 'visit' thing
@lisitsyn	that prints node
@lisitsyn	because we mess with bootstrap and classes are not enough
@HeikoS	shouldn not be too hard should it?
@lisitsyn	should be easy
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: if we go with better naming of functions it would look really amazing
@lisitsyn	people will love it
@lisitsyn	get_something() is non-sense in java
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah I like tha tone
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I think we should combine it with the manual thing
@HeikoS	integrate it straight away to get these things out together
@HeikoS	one *big* downside though is that the API docs dont work anymore
@HeikoS	currently, syntax is the same
@HeikoS	and that is good
@HeikoS	so not sure about details there
@lisitsyn	should be solvable
@lisitsyn	I need to force myself to work on doc/distribution of shogun
@lisitsyn	instead of neural nets :D
@HeikoS	hehe
@lisitsyn	something made me to refactor some code there
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I mean as far as I know we cannot generate API for different languages
@HeikoS	but if we had the examples, then this is fine as it shows how to use the API
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you ahve an idea how to define this visit thing?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have seen some example
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	actually in http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/tutorial.html they define visit_* thing
@lisitsyn	but I've seen some other example
@lisitsyn	how to add custom stuff there
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13168702/how-to-add-rel-attribute-to-docutils-sphinx-reference-in-html-output that's it
@HeikoS	ok let me check
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so its just self.body.append
@lisitsyn	looks like
@lisitsyn	lets try
@HeikoS	Ill just pase his code in ours and see what happens
@HeikoS	mmh
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I just tried to self.body.append
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: doesnt seem like its doing something
@lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but he does someting as self.body.append and then self.context.append
@lisitsyn	hah stop I was doing some useless stuff
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the code is actually not executed
@HeikoS	I mean the visit code
@lisitsyn	yeah I tried to modfiy visit_sgexample
@lisitsyn	which is not used anyway
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: mmh
@HeikoS	why is that?
@HeikoS	was the orginal example different?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we use ShogunExample
@lisitsyn	but not sgexample
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its this phase 4 they talk about
@HeikoS	doesnt seem to change anything?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/tutorial.html
@lisitsyn	oka
@HeikoS	check description of phase 4
@lisitsyn	I managed to add a tag
@HeikoS	This phase converts the resolved doctrees to the desired output format, such as HTML or LaTeX. This happens via a so-called docutils writer that visits the individual nodes of each doctree and produces some output in the process.
@lisitsyn	we are close
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok I can commit now
@HeikoS	ok go
@lisitsyn	but it doesn't work
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	what did you do then?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I added divs with proper role
@lisitsyn	around the code
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	why doesnt it work?
@lisitsyn	some bootstrap stuff
@lisitsyn	it breaks due to some strange layout I guess
@lisitsyn	or maybe no ids
@lisitsyn	let me check
@HeikoS	kk
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we have multiple tab panel
@HeikoS	ill wait for the push
@lisitsyn	this is tricky
@HeikoS	really?
@HeikoS	should not be
@HeikoS	because we just iterate?
@HeikoS	and its all tree structure?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah our template makes it very tricky
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean
@lisitsyn	we have tabpanel that serves python/java/..
@lisitsyn	and it has tab-content that's basically whole page
@lisitsyn	and inside of that we have another tab-content
@lisitsyn	this gets really tricky
@lisitsyn	okay anyway that's html problem now
@lisitsyn	I'll commit now and continue later
@lisitsyn	pushed
@HeikoS	cool Ill check
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: wait sergey
@HeikoS	its different
@HeikoS	its not a whole page
@HeikoS	we changed that
@HeikoS	the template still has the thing globally
@HeikoS	but only the code blocks are duplicated ,the page itself is not
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes and it won't work globally
@lisitsyn	I don't think it can work with nested tab-content
@HeikoS	but do we need that even?
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	mmmh
@lisitsyn	there is only one section for tabs
@lisitsyn	but multiple tab sets
@lisitsyn	like for every snippet
@lisitsyn	but it's other problem
@lisitsyn	I think I can fix that
@lisitsyn	needs some javascript
@HeikoS	really?
@HeikoS	dont know anything about this
@HeikoS	how doe sthat work?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think we need to add callbacks for these 'global' tabs
@lisitsyn	and invisible 'local' tabs
@lisitsyn	invisible tab headers I mean
@lisitsyn	so when one selects some global tab
@lisitsyn	all corresponding local tabs are selected
@lisitsyn	do you follow the idea?
 nileshK	Lisitsyn: I am still having one more issue.
@lisitsyn	nileshK: what's it?
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/odLBYcdO
 nileshK	This is the code we have for LpBoost example
 nileshK	I am not able to collect the output after training
 nileshK	the object with the data.
@lisitsyn	I don't get it
@lisitsyn	what output?
 nileshK	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/applications/classification/random_fourier_classification.cpp
 nileshK	Like in this example if you check line no:
 nileshK	50
 nileshK	150*
 nileshK	You see they are getting the weights w after training
@lisitsyn	you want the learned weight vector?
 nileshK	I dont see how to collect the training output
 nileshK	Yea
@lisitsyn	get_w
 nileshK	But then if you move to line : 159
 nileshK	will just giving that w be good enough
@lisitsyn	that's random features specific
 nileshK	I am trying to find an analogy b/w this code and lpboost example and create a similar one
@lisitsyn	you don't need to do anything with weights
@lisitsyn	once learned you can apply lpboost
@lisitsyn	it will use learned weights
 nileshK	then how do you check the output for the test samples
@lisitsyn	nileshK: line 176 of your example
@lisitsyn	it returns binary labels with predicted classes
 nileshK	that code is not workgin
@lisitsyn	what error?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: actually, not sure
@HeikoS	but I dont know much javascript
@HeikoS	can you gist an example?
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/lilEQF03
 nileshK	This is the error which comes while training it
 nileshK	This is the gdb output

@lisitsyn	don't know
@lisitsyn	I guess there is no unified cool open source solution for LP
 nileshK	HeikoS: what do you mean by other way?
@lisitsyn	w/o cplex
 nileshK	Cplex is good right?
 nileshK	There are other libraries lpsolve
@lisitsyn	cplex is good but not open source yeah
 nileshK	Lpsolve is good option in that case
@HeikoS	nileshK: do you know other lp solvers?
@HeikoS	nileshK, lisitsyn could be a cool GSoC project
 nileshK	I think yes. Because the amount of work that is currently required to get these things working
 nileshK	is quite enough
 nileshK	HeikoS just confirm one thing, do know whether lpBoost is tested?
@HeikoS	nileshK: no idea
@HeikoS	this is all very old stuff before all of us were around
@HeikoS	so you will have to try, sorry
@HeikoS	but any findings are absolutely welcome
@HeikoS	so document them on github issues
@HeikoS	this increases probability of getting them fixed and working again
