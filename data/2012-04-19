 blackburn	n4nd0: and yours?
 n4nd0	blackburn: databases, microwave engineering and wireless communications (dsp for wireless communications)
 n4nd0	what do you study on dsp?
 blackburn	n4nd0: FFT, random signals processing
 n4nd0	I think that is kind of cool :)
 blackburn	that's always better than optics
 blackburn	(actually everything is better than optics)
 blackburn	to eat some dirt for example is way much better than do some optics I think :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok see you
 n4nd0	blackburn: good night!
 blackburn	good night

 blackburn	sonne|work: wow why did you merge it?
 blackburn	(I planned to complete it)
 blackburn	gsomix: n4nd0: any of you around?
 sonne|work	blackburn: I thought you did
 sonne|work	at least there was no indication that you didn't
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok sorry I'll mention that next time :)
 blackburn	some stuff to go still
 blackburn	ssl.cpp etc
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw have you seen liblinear :)
 sonne|work	it has regression now
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes checking right now
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you think it is so useful?
 sonne|work	I plan to merge it today
 sonne|work	yes of course
 sonne|work	svr is pretty good
 blackburn	sonne|work: will you?
 sonne|work	it should be easy
 blackburn	I mean I can
 blackburn	if it is needed :)
 sonne|work	after all SVR is reduced to svm prolbme
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah I am here
 sonne|work	you have exams :D
 sonne|work	so no time
 sonne|work	but I have a train ride :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes I got 5 today for my database project
 sonne|work	good luck then
 blackburn	sonne|work: damned optics tomorrow
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you need more tasks?
 blackburn	or some exam holidays? ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm it sounds appealing but I have still stuff to finish in shogun and exams coming next week
 n4nd0	blackburn: but tell me in any case, it is probably interesting
 blackburn	n4nd0: I have nothing in mind yet but if it is needed I'll come up with something ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: can you guide me a little how to patch libocas to solve that
 blackburn	||w||^2 + w0 w problem
 blackburn	?
 sonne|work	blackburn: and n4nd0 should do this cool benchmarking problem :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: ask vojtech directly
 blackburn	sonne|work: covertree / qsort?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok I will
 sonne|work	blackburn: faster way to compute distance
 blackburn	sonne|work: upper bounded?
 blackburn	btw I have seen harshit was talking about huge dataset yesterday
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	he wants to try knn there
 blackburn	it was 4000 vectors?
 n4nd0	I understood that dimension of the vectors was 4000
 blackburn	ghm what a huge dataset ;)
 sonne|work	blackburn: no by doing ||x-y||^2 = ||x||^2 -2xy + ||y||^2
-!- av3ngr [av3ngr@nat/redhat/x-jczscjkexunpkdrx] has quit [Quit: That's all folks!]
 blackburn	sonne|work: precompute xy?
 sonne|work	x^Tx can be precomputed
 n4nd0	the tests I am doing around every day with qsort / covertree are already bigger than 4000 vectors ;)
 sonne|work	only x^T y needs to be done
 sonne|work	blackburn: that is what we use in gaussian kernel btw
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes I know
 sonne|work	quite a bit faster there I would assume
 blackburn	sonne|work: hmmm if we assume vectors as normalized
 blackburn	we can use only dot there
 blackburn	sounds like a good option to use for me
 n4nd0	sonne|work, blackburn so that decomposition should make it faster than using cblas function for the norm?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmmmm
-!- PhilTillet [~android@92.90.16.93] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 sonne|work	n4nd0: a lot - because you save even computing x-y
 blackburn	no need to compute square
 sonne|work	square is not the problem - it is done once at the end
 sonne|work	sqrt I meant
 sonne|work	forget what I said
 n4nd0	ok ...
 blackburn	sonne|work: sqrt is not but (x-y)(x-y) ;)

 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	wiking: see the very above
 wiking	ok i have a fix
 sonne|work	git clean -dfx
 wiking	mmm i've just got connected
 sonne|work	(it will erase everything not in git from shogun)
 sonne|work	wiking: so no need for a fix :D
 wiking	jlcovertree is not part of shogun?
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/commit/edd4b29fa0b09226c2bb34e99d601d6e2247fa40
 wiking	otherwise it won't compile on a BSD-like system
 wiking	as it does not have <values.h>
 sonne|work	wiking: I see
 sonne|work	what is values used for at all?
 sonne|work	I mean why do we need it?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: any idea?
 wiking	hehehe no idea :)
 wiking	i've just sent you now the pull request
 sonne|work	does it compile if you remove it?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am checking
 blackburn	what is values?
 blackburn	http://tigcc.ticalc.org/doc/values.html
 blackburn	some crazy consts
 n4nd0	it seems that the file values.h is nowhere
 blackburn	mystery file
 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: hi
 wiking	blackburn: what was so funny yesterday?
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	wiking: your git hotline
 n4nd0	I don't really know why my compilation didn't fail locally
 wiking	blackburn: well you it's a bit funny ;)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: linux
 sonne|work	I think we should modify the code to work w/o vlaues
 sonne|work	values.h
 wiking	n4nd0: as said you have linux
 wiking	sonne|work: or move values include under some base/ header
 blackburn	Hello, Git consulting, Viktor is on line
 wiking	hahahah yeah
 sonne|work	no
 wiking	and to see how fucken nice i am
 wiking	or unbiased
 wiking	i'm even supporting my competition
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	olympics spirit lol
 wiking	yeps
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't think anyone here wants your project :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: huh! pull request is here
 wiking	sonne|work: yes yes they want!
 wiking	ok i have a lil libqp fix as well
 wiking	let me add the qp branch to my repo
 sonne|work	these bastards
 wiking	oh these mother!@#
 blackburn	sonne|work: I also thought nobody wants my project
 wiking	so i've added libqp_gsmo https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/commit/8e24e152bfba02cfc4e0890c485667455cbfcaf2
 wiking	since it's included in libqp.h
 wiking	but the problem now that i cannot cherry-pick the pull request
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	where did you get that?
 blackburn	;)
 wiking	which what?
 wiking	libqp_gsm?
 wiking	gsmo
 wiking	it's from libqp
 sonne|work	wiking: it seems to compile here w/o values.h
 wiking	but it has never been added to shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: can you try if you need it at all under osx?
 wiking	sonne|work: ok just a sec
 wiking	n4nd0: so where did u get this code?
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	or why did you do the include <values.h> ?
 blackburn	can somebody send me an sms if chris arrives? :D
 n4nd0	wiking: from there http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	i wonder if it uses really any of those macros
 n4nd0	I don't even know what is defined in values.h
 wiking	:D
 wiking	mm i think it compiles for me as well... although i'm still waiting for finishing it
 wiking	ok yeah now it's already doing doxygen
 wiking	so it was ok
 sonne|work	wiking: ok then
 wiking	sonne|work: yep compiles
 wiking	sonne|work: can u remove then the header
 wiking	and i'll merge my repo?
 sonne|work	letst remove the header
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r000a882 / src/shogun/lib/JLCoverTree.h : remove values.h include - http://git.io/iXGNbA
 wiking	ok cool
 wiking	i'll try to merge now
 wiking	ok here's my pull request for libqp
 wiking	don't worry about the 3 commits... it only adds the file itself.. i had to do a merge in order to not to fuck up totally my repo
 shogun-buildbot	build #744 of libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/744  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 wiking	ahahahah
 wiking	MAXFLOAT
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	wiking: looks like you forgot the rebase https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/470
 wiking	so fuck
 wiking	isn't maxfloat defined somewhere in shogun already?
 sonne|work	grep MAXFLOAT /usr/include/math.h
 wiking	noup
 wiking	not on my system
 wiking	no ok it'll work as well here
 sonne|work	# ifdef __USE_XOPEN
 sonne|work	/* X/Open wants another strange constant.  */
 sonne|work	#  define MAXFLOAT  3.40282347e+38F
 sonne|work	# endif
 sonne|work	here hmmhh
 wiking	it's just in another header that it's included in math.h
 sonne|work	yeah but math is already included in that tree?!

 blackburn	n4nd0: just replace with CMath::ALMOST_INFTY or so?

 al___	thanks
 n4nd0	al___: you can do a patch with that there ;)
 al___	It will be a pleasure, can you tell me how to do it ? :p
 n4nd0	you can issue a pull request from github
 blackburn	or create a patch and send it
 blackburn	sonne|work: can you apply a patch?
 blackburn	however PR is more preferrable I think
 wiking	:>>
 al___	I m little bit nex to github, I can read the open PR but how can I create a new one ?
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	sonne|work: you should have just taken my patch :>>
 blackburn	al___: fork shogun - clone your fork - do some changes locally - push to your remote on github - create pull request using github interface

 wiking	ok i think i have the solution
 wiking	just somebody help me to rebase my giiit!
 n4nd0	wiking: are you kidding?
 wiking	yep no
 n4nd0	I don't have the source with me right now, sorry :(
 wiking	n4nd0: no worries
 wiking	i think we should use FLT_MAX
 wiking	since it's iso c standard
 wiking	not like MAXFLOAT
 wiking	that is xsi
 wiking	anybody here on debian or has access to debian
 wiking	that can test this for me?
 wiking	although according to the repo FLT_MAX has been used in other sources and since those compiles...
 blackburn	wiking: why not CMath's constant?
 wiking	because it's not really the flt_max
 blackburn	why not to change CMath's stuff to real max?
 wiking	well it's not the same
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	actually I am not used to work with e+38 distances and hardly can imagine that :)
 wiking	well
 wiking	afaik it's there because to check float overflow
 blackburn	hmm I thought it is kind of maximal distance
-!- xiangwang [~chatzilla@159.226.60.224] has joined #shogun

 sonne|work	wiking: it is soo easy to make you happy :D
 wiking	although
 wiking	should have taken my pull request
 wiking	because this way now we have this
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/470
 wiking	:DDD
 sonne|work	wiking: sry didn't see this
 wiking	ok i'll try now a rebase :DDD
 wiking	it'll be horrible for sure
 wiking	ok wasn't that bad as i thought it would be
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess it is about time to play with git reset --hard :D
 shogun-buildbot	build #745 of libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/745
 sonne|work	huray
 wiking	sonne|work: yeps
 sonne|work	wiking about libqp - shouldn't you rather incorporate / take the whole beast at once?
 wiking	sonne|work: ?
 sonne|work	whole lipqp?
 wiking	you  mean when i already have the wrappers?
 wiking	i mean otherwise the whole libqp is there
 wiking	i've checked the latest code of libqp
 wiking	the _splx in shogun was up to date
 wiking	and the header as well
 sonne|work	ahh so the rest is up to date?
 sonne|work	then ok
 wiking	yep
 wiking	let me just fix again my repo
 wiking	:))
 sonne|work	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/470/commits
 sonne|work	yeah one request only please
 wiking	yep
 wiking	i'm just trying to fix it now
 sonne|work	so git reset --hard should do and a pull with a rebase and push --force
 wiking	ok
 wiking	rebased
 wiking	check now the link
 wiking	it's only 1 commit now
 CIA-64	shogun: Viktor Gal master * rfc8fa5e / src/shogun/lib/external/libqp_gsmo.cpp :

 CIA-64	shogun: add libqp_gsmo_solver - http://git.io/_6v3Rw
 sonne|work	there we go
 sonne|work	now we should get pr_loqo.cpp (in shogun already) into shape to match libqp's interface

 wiking	loll good that you are telling me this
 wiking	:)
 sonne|work	and actually while we are at it also CTron
 blackburn	sonne|work: I was like O_O when I saw predictor-corrector stuff in pr_loqo
 sonne|work	?!
 n4nd0	wiking: so is it libq integration in shogun better now?
 wiking	n4nd0: not even near to it
 n4nd0	wiking: lot of stuff left to do still?
 wiking	yeah well we need a descent c++ wrapper for all the qp solvers

-!- xiangwang [~chatzilla@159.226.60.224] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: so by the way... is there any other qp solvers in shogun?
 wiking	and shouldn't we move qp solvers out of classifiers?
 sonne|work	wiking: that is what I said :)
 wiking	hahahah where? :)
 sonne|work	well pr_loqo and tron
 sonne|work	but IMHO these should go into lipqp
 wiking	into?
 wiking	in what sense
 wiking	i mean libqp is just as is
 wiking	let's separate libqp and libqp wrapping
 wiking	imho

 sonne|work	wiking: no I am talking about making it libqp_prloqo.cpp
 wiking	?
 sonne|work	and getting it core libqp
 sonne|work	and on top of it the qp interface
 wiking	so you wanna put prloqo into libqp?
 sonne|work	yes
 wiking	or make it as part of it
 wiking	ah ok
 sonne|work	and tron
 wiking	tron as well
 wiking	cool
 wiking	can we move them to maybe
 wiking	lets say src/shogun/qp
 wiking	?
 wiking	or something like that?
 wiking	as it's not an external lib
 sonne|work	wiking: I thought so too but now that blackburn started this lib/external stuff I think these should be in there ... maybe external/libqp
 wiking	mmm but they are not part of libqp
 wiking	so i mean when let's say
 wiking	vojtech updates the libqp
 sonne|work	no but they should become part of it
 wiking	it's pretty easy to do an upgrade
 sonne|work	let me talk to vojech
 wiking	ok
 sonne|work	about this
 wiking	talk with him decide and then i'll move it
 wiking	but afaik we'll still need a src/shogun/qp
 sonne|work	yes
 wiking	to put there the wrapper classes
 sonne|work	maybe better shogun/optimizer
 wiking	ok
 sonne|work	and have the qp stuff in there
 sonne|work	and some linear stuff etc too
 wiking	that sounds good
 wiking	ok i'll then make an optimizer dir and put there the abstract wrapper as a starter
 wiking	and then we'll see what to do with pr_loqo and tron
 sonne|work	have a look at cplex.h too maybe remotely kind of this
 wiking	mmmhm
 wiking	okey
 wiking	but first things first i want to finish my simple cccp implementation for latent
 wiking	today i've done already too much branch switching till now :)

 sonne|work	hey pluskid
 sonne|work	welcome back
 pluskid	:)
 pluskid	just back from the trip
 pluskid	I saw your feedbacks
 sonne|work	I guessed so
 pluskid	will fix those soon (tomorrow)
 pluskid	too tired to work tonight
 sonne|work	no worries
 sonne|work	if none of you applied at a different org we already now know who will be in
 pluskid	btw, do you think I should keep the code for reading and writing multiclass strategy in MulticlassSVM?
 pluskid	I only applied shogun
 pluskid	so am I in? :p
 sonne|work	hehe
 pluskid	won't tell me this moment? haha, bad boy
 sonne|work	that only means you are selected by us then you will be in :)
 sonne|work	I am not allowed to
 sonne|work	but I don't think it is too hard to guess
 pluskid	btw, I'm just curious, sonne|work , do you hate STL? :p
 sonne|work	anyways multiclass svm -> maybe multiclass kernel machine?
 sonne|work	pluskid: yes but don't ask my why
 sonne|work	blackburn asked me that so often that I forgot
 sonne|work	except that it looks ugly (syntax wise)
 wiking	when is the list going to be released?
 pluskid	OK, that's why they decided to sent you a gift of STL book, haha
 wiking	only next tuesday?
 sonne|work	google will announce on 23rd
 pluskid	I can also feel your hate toward STL, too :)
 wiking	STL for sonne|work \o/
 sonne|work	*grrgg*
 wiking	but honestly one should consider valarray :)
 sonne|work	wiking: we have SGVector :P
 pluskid	I think the read/write of multiclass-strategy should be put in a read/write function in MulticlassMachine
 wiking	sonne|work: yes but within sgvector
 pluskid	but it seems current there's no such function in MulticlassMachine
 wiking	instead of having float*
 sonne|work	pluskid: multiclasskernelmachine
 wiking	a valarray would allow a lot of automatic optimization...
 sonne|work	these functions are not used anyways I would guess
 pluskid	why?
 sonne|work	maybe some used them long time ago for multiclass svms
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	then I'll not worry too much about that
 pluskid	I'd try to keep it similar to the original code
 sonne|work	but nowadays the save_serializable / load_serializable stuff is much more powerful/usefull
 pluskid	so, this two manually crafted function might be removed some day
 sonne|work	I think all load/save() functions should go
 pluskid	wiking: what is a valarray?
 pluskid	sonne|work: at this moment?
 sonne|work	no
 wiking	pluskid: the forgotten child of STL
 wiking	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/valarray/
 sonne|work	wiking: why the massive overhead?
 wiking	it's really a very very small overhead
 wiking	compared to other STL containers
 wiking	as this is really not a real STL container
 sonne|work	hehe
 sonne|work	we simply want to be fast for low-dimensional data too
 wiking	and recent g++ implementation use a done a lot of optimization with that
 wiking	i.e. using SIMD and multiple thread out of box
 sonne|work	and having more than size / refcount as overhead is imho not acceptable
 wiking	since valarray is a really simple class
 pluskid	oh, it seems what a valarray is what we wish to do with our SGVector?
 sonne|work	pluskid: yeah the a+b, sin(a) etc operations
 wiking	sonne|work: check out the definition of valarray template: /usr/include/c++/4.2.1/valarray
 wiking	   private:
 wiking	      size_t _M_size;
 wiking	      _Tp* __restrict__ _M_data;
 wiking	      
 wiking	this is all the overhead ;)
 pluskid	btw, I seriously think we need some basic matrix operations support after doing the LARS work, Blas/LaPack is a bit difficult to use, especially for simple tasks like dot product of vectors, we need some wrappers
 pluskid	wiking: maybe we need to do some standard benchmarks someday to persuade sonne|work that STL (at least valarray) is not that evil
 wiking	pluskid: hehehe there's already such available... just google it
 pluskid	wiking: about valarray or STL?
 wiking	valarray
 pluskid	I googled "valarray benchmark", and the first result it "why is valarray so slow", haha
 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	stackoverflow
 wiking	:)
 wiking	pluskid: http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/heinzl/img760.png
 wiking	pluskid: http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/heinzl/node47.html
 pluskid	cool, seems especially optimized for "small" (10^3) sized vector
 wiking	mm
 wiking	i mean in this sense maybe having GSL will solve all the problems ;)
 pluskid	haha, another huge dependency that I guess sonne|work also hates :p
 wiking	hahaha
 pluskid	be back in a while
 wiking	but gsl is just about over optimizing all kind of vector/matrix operations

 wiking	mmm
 wiking	anybody else might need a CMath:: function that not only returns the max value of a vector but the position/index of that max value as well?
 blackburn	wiking: isn't it available already?
 wiking	mmm is it? i was looking for ::max
 wiking	only found  static inline T max(T* vec, int32_t len)
 wiking	till now
 blackburn	arg_max?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	there's no such
 wiking	or at least i couldn't find till now in Math.h
 blackburn	line 900 or so
 sonne|work	static inline int32_t arg_max(T * vec, int32_t inc, int32_t len, T * maxv_ptr = NULL)
 wiking	lol?
 wiking	git grep arg_max
 wiking	0 resuls
 sonne|work	no objections for having a simpler one though
 wiking	results
 wiking	is it maybe in a recent commit?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	by fernando I guess
 sonne|work	QDA commit
 wiking	since i haven't rebased my latent branch for a hiwhile
 wiking	ah ok
 blackburn	shogun/classifier/QDA.cpp:              out->set_label(i, CMath::arg_max(norm2.vector+i, num_vecs, m_num_classes));
 blackburn	shogun/mathematics/Math.h:              /// return arg_max(vec)
 blackburn	shogun/mathematics/Math.h:                      static inline int32_t arg_max(T * vec, int32_t inc, int32_t len, T * maxv_ptr = NULL)
 wiking	so that much be the reason
 wiking	ok i'll rebase then

 gsomix	n4nd0, which exams in this year?
 n4nd0	gsomix: so I'll do next week databases and microwave engineering
 n4nd0	gsomix: wireless communications in a couple of weeks
 gsomix	>> databases | theoretical course?
 n4nd0	not really
 n4nd0	the first semester was rather theoretical
 n4nd0	now it is half of it sql
 n4nd0	and other half security and normlization
 n4nd0	normalization,
 n4nd0	sorry
 n4nd0	gsomix: what about you?
 n4nd0	optics?
 gsomix	n4nd0, math analysis, complex analysis, philosophy and optics
 gsomix	in june, i think.
 gsomix	n4nd0, I have horrible course about databases... FoxPro 9 =____=
 gsomix	*in last year
 n4nd0	FoxPro 9, no idea
 n4nd0	I have never taken a course itself in complex analysis, but I have done stuff with transforms
 n4nd0	and last year I used it quite a bit in a course in electromagnetism
 n4nd0	I think complex analysis looks nice
 n4nd0	do you like it?
 gsomix	n4nd0, yep. but i'm missing a lot of lectures about it.
 gsomix	>> in a course in electromagnetism | aha, impedances and other

@sonney2k	too many for any train ride
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think you need the Siberian train for that :)

 n4nd0	sonney2k: oh, is he already at another company?
 puffin444	JL?
 n4nd0	John Langford
@sonney2k	puffin444, inventor of isomap
@sonney2k	and author of the fastest covertree on earth
 n4nd0	and the cover tree ;)
 n4nd0	haha
@sonney2k	and vowpal vabbit :)
 n4nd0	we are still not done with ours :P
@sonney2k	w
 gsomix	legend :)
 puffin444	Oh isomap? The manifold learning algorithm?
 n4nd0	puffin444: yeah, dimensionality reduction
@sonney2k	puffin444, this guy http://hunch.net/~jl/
 n4nd0	I think he has also been with Thrun with particle filters
 puffin444	Ok I knew that name sounded familiar
 puffin444	Sebastian Thrun?
 n4nd0	yeah
 puffin444	Oh wow!
 n4nd0	they are both authors of this paper http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/dt_particle_filter/nips02.pdf
@sonney2k	he is a big shot and a cool guy (as you can guess from the picture :)
 n4nd0	I think it is pretty awesome that he was mentor of a project in shogun last year
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no project suited or not enough time this year?
 puffin444	Oh wow he has also been involved in captcha
@sonney2k	n4nd0, also I didn't have enough time this year
 puffin444	Looking at his website, it looks like he has done a lot of cool stuff. It must have been exciting to have him as a mentor.
@sonney2k	and am having
@sonney2k	unfortunatly shashwat didn't continue development
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you think about particle filters? could it be a place in shogun for it?
@sonney2k	I would have hoped he does some more on vw / shogun
 n4nd0	I'm just curious about it
 PhilTillet	wah, paper with Thrun!
@sonney2k	I don't know anything about it
@sonney2k	hmmhh I know JL better than Thrun (would even say he is more famous)
 n4nd0	oh do you think so?
@sonney2k	but I guess due to this stanford lecture thrun is more known
 n4nd0	in the environment I mode Thrun is like a rock star :D
@sonney2k	and of course for winning the darpa thing
 n4nd0	I move*
 PhilTillet	yes :p that's how I knew him
 PhilTillet	that ai-class made him a rockstar lol
 n4nd0	for the people in my department he has been a rockstar since fast slam
@sonney2k	fast slam?
 n4nd0	they have told me about a lecture he gave here at KTH about it
@sonney2k	about?
 n4nd0	about fast slam
 n4nd0	it is a method used for localization in robotics
 n4nd0	SLAM stands for simultaneous localization and mapping
 n4nd0	a robot doesn't know where it is and goes around building a map and getting an idea where it is at the same time
@sonney2k	ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: about particle filters, are you more familiar with the condensation algorithm?
@sonney2k	ok then about rockstars
@sonney2k	does anyone know gary bradski here?
 n4nd0	yeah
@sonney2k	n4nd0, not at all
 n4nd0	Willow Garage, OpenCV
 puffin444	Doen't ring a bell
@sonney2k	yeah ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I checked the videolecture with he and you ;)

 n4nd0	I don't know that many
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok then last one
 mohataher	I have a question, when to use SGVector and when to use SGMatrix ? (when having one column only of course), I ask coz I was advised in a pull-request to use SGMatrix instead of SGVector coz it's lightweight. Any explanation ?
@sonney2k	vladimir vapnik?

 n4nd0	lot of papers and work related to SO
@sonney2k	old ones then or?
@sonney2k	JL goes to microsoft...
 n4nd0	mmm I think 5 years old at most, are those considered old ones?
