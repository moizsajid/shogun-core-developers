 lambday	HeikoS: check this when you have some free time.. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/README_linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: will do, got my exam today so soon :)
 lambday	HeikoS: okay.. all the best :)
@HeikoS	lambday: first look: amazing!
 lambday	HeikoS: haha thanks :D
@HeikoS	lambday: section on extending and using in code would be cool, howto
@HeikoS	lambday: ok will get back to you on this
@HeikoS	lambday: but really cool, we need more stuff like that
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah... will finish off the content by tonight
@HeikoS	lambday: one thing, we could use doxygen for actually taking the code from running code examples, like I suggested to kislays opencv tutorial
@HeikoS	lambday: not necessary for snippets but for real examples (that we dont want to fully print) it would be cool as it maintains itselfd
@HeikoS	ok see you
 lambday	HeikoS: okay.. yeah will figure it out
 lambday	see you
