 [1]warpy	hey sonney2k, why do you believe the typemap needs to be rewritten, i dont understand ?
@bettyboo	hey
@sonney2k	nothing was working yet
 [1]warpy	doesnt mean what is there is crap, doesnt it ?

 heiko	sonney2k, in Hierachical clustering, I will just use mean of cluster elements to build cluster centers. Are you ok with that?
 heiko	sonney2k, I made the methods NOTIMPLEMENTED for now, will produce a distance machine example first.

@sonney2k	heiko, my new memory arrived
@sonney2k	the 16 don't work :(
@sonney2k	but only 8
@sonney2k	so I will try to install new (more silent) fans / bigger heat sinks and some build bot in the coming days...

 heiko	sonney2k, great, buildbots :)
 heiko	sad with the 16GB
 heiko	sonney2k, has anyone ever tested KMeans?

@sonney2k	f-x, did you already do the corrections?
 heiko	sonney2k, did you already have a look onto the distance machine patch?
@sonney2k	heiko, no sorry
 heiko	it is rather big, but i described the most important changes in the comment
 heiko	will start witth the parameter version stuff tomorrow if its ok.
@sonney2k	I just had a look at it
@sonney2k	it is big indeed but I don't see any obvious mistakes...

@sonney2k	heiko, sure
* sonney2k is fiddling with his mainboard
@sonney2k	adding massive heatsinks and fans
 heiko	sonney2k, oh no, computer hardware struggeling is the worst part of computer science
 heiko	at least for me, i actually prefer pen &paper computer science ;)
@sonney2k	heiko, there were times I liked that part about cs but looks like these times are over now :)
@sonney2k	I suddenly just want things to work
 heiko	hehe ;)
 heiko	I often really get angry at my computer because of this kind of stuff
 heiko	sonney2k, btw just realised that the registration of model selection parameters has not been done and also is ignored yet, because model selection is simple performed on an objects parameters instead of on its model selection parameters
 heiko	remember, I added these macros for adding parameters
 heiko	but they are not used yet
 heiko	and model selection framework simply checks if a parameter of that name is available
 heiko	but, ok lets talk about that tomorrow
 heiko	good look with your server
 heiko	ehm, luck :)
 heiko	bye
@bettyboo	^_^

 f-x	sonney2k: oh.. yeah.. i did those corrections.. sgd appears to be working like it was before..
@sonney2k	f-x, the SG_REF* ones I mentioned?
@sonney2k	(didn't see your pull request)
 f-x	sonney2k: hopefully taken care of
 f-x	also, sonney2k, while doing vw
 f-x	i found in order to make the 'cache' generated by our vw implementation compatible with the original,
 f-x	we need to have labels as float32_t
 f-x	(normal float)

 f-x	is this allowed? why do we use float64_t labels right now btw? is the extra precision required?
@sonney2k	difficult question...
 f-x	does it not make sense for the VW class to handle it as float32_t and for the external/generic stuff to cast it to float64_t?
-!- alesis-novik [~alesis@cpat001.wlan.net.ed.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 alesis-novik	Hey, I don't remember if I asked this, but does R_modular work?
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, it does not work
@sonney2k	f-x, that makes a lot of sense - even for online learners in general I would say
 f-x	sonney2k: okay.. so i'm going to let the labels be float32_t for now in vw
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, swig-R is simply too buggy to get shogun to work
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, thanks
