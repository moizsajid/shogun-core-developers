 n4nd0	hey
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn: we talked last week about meeting this evening again right?
 n4nd0	I recall something about it
 blackburn	n4nd0: ha, yes probably
 n4nd0	blackburn: nice, I will be around here then from 22:00 or a little bit before
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://google-opensource.blogspot.se/ have you seen the post about B-trees?
 blackburn	no, let me read it
 blackburn	quite nice
 blackburn	n4nd0: if we used maps in tapkee I'd give it a go :)
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you ever seen result of embedding promoter data?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no, how is it?
 blackburn	in the plots_and_benchmark folder

 n4nd0	blackburn: let me see
 blackburn	interesting fact that 2d embedding that is computed by LLE reproduces one real axe - GC content
 blackburn	n4nd0: let me compute and I will show a pic
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 n4nd0	I don't see that directory ^
 blackburn	n4nd0: JMLR/plots_and_benchmark in your dropbox
 n4nd0	aaah ok dropbox, I was looking in github :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe I missed it
 n4nd0	is the plot around?
 blackburn	doing
 n4nd0	ok, sorry :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: I tried first time without optimizations
 n4nd0	slow?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	more than twice slow
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/ml/promoter.png
 blackburn	n4nd0: the x has R=-0.98 with GC%
 blackburn	GC is {# of {G or C}} divided by total number of nucleotides in chain
 blackburn	GC content is*
 blackburn	I was surprised to see that but bioinformatics elders said it is expected
 n4nd0	mmm I see
 n4nd0	I don't understand much about biology :S
 blackburn	do you think I do?
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe you know a lot about a lot ;)
 blackburn	I somehow manage to let people think I do :D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	ok gtg now, tty later

 n4nd0	blackburn: so what do you think about the workshop program?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't know.. I am ok with it anyway :)
 n4nd0	:)
-!- cwidmer [8ca3fe9d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.140.163.254.157] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	the christian
 cwidmer	hi all
 blackburn	hey
 cwidmer	what's going on?
 n4nd0	hi cwidmer! how is it going?
 blackburn	nothing to be honest
 cwidmer	going alright, tons of stuff to do
 cwidmer	just moved into a new place
 n4nd0	cool, in NY?
 cwidmer	yeah
 blackburn	cwidmer: we should talk altogether with n4nd0 about tapkee stuff I think :)
 cwidmer	closer to work, nicer view
 blackburn	do you have some time?
 n4nd0	I have it :)
 cwidmer	well, not too much, but I can do 15min
 cwidmer	how about the workshop meeting?
 cwidmer	didn't we agree on... now?
 n4nd0	I have no idea if we were supposed to meet at 21 or 22 (local time)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ping
 cwidmer	ah, ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, pong
 blackburn	sonney2k: meeting!
@sonney2k	I have no news - will have a phone conf next week with gunnar about the WS
@sonney2k	but IMHO what we have is perfectly fine
@sonney2k	and people expect some minor changes to the program anyways
 blackburn	sonney2k: I added that Q about skills
 blackburn	check that out
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw - we should ask about the level of participants
 n4nd0	sure
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	cwidmer: n4nd0 too
 n4nd0	blackburn: checking, the form right?
@sonney2k	I missed the c-base meeting. Next is on the 14th
 blackburn	I added 4 possible answers
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	right after institution IIRC
@sonney2k	only interesting question would be if alexlovesdata would manage to get TU booked for some hands on days
 n4nd0	sonney2k: exactly
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think the form is looking good
 blackburn	well if all of you think so lets post it massively starting from some day and let me answer mails
 n4nd0	blackburn: the new Q it is not as particular as I think sonney2k (e.g. have you trained any SVM/GP), but I think it is good like this too
 cwidmer	blackburn, can you show the form?
 n4nd0	blackburn: count on me to share the load of answering if it becomes too much ;)
 cwidmer	how much will it cost for participants?
 blackburn	cwidmer: here you go https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFoS0Q2U19qYkdjT2VReFNvNDBoclE6MQ
 n4nd0	cwidmer: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFoS0Q2U19qYkdjT2VReFNvNDBoclE6MQ
 cwidmer	nice
 n4nd0	blackburn: you are the fastest around here :P
 blackburn	lol
 cwidmer	again, for what would you like to discuss I would really link add something like (unconference style) with a link to wikipedia
 blackburn	I do not understand that much
 cwidmer	ok, so no news otherwise sonney2k?
 blackburn	cwidmer: what should I add?
 cwidmer	What do you want to discuss? --> What do you want to discuss (unconference session (link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)?
 cwidmer	unless this is the podium discussion
 cwidmer	I mean we have two discussion sessions, I guess
 cwidmer	one podium
 blackburn	okay let me do that
 cwidmer	one in small groups
 cwidmer	not sure, which one you're referring to
 blackburn	cwidmer: okay added
 cwidmer	awesome
@sonney2k	IMHO we should discuss once I had this call with gunanr
@sonney2k	cwidmer, knows how hard it is to catch gunnar these days...
@sonney2k	cwidmer, btw did you tell him?
 n4nd0	everyone gone here? :D
 blackburn	hah
 cwidmer	ok
 cwidmer	just talked to gunnar
 cwidmer	and he says yes(*)
 cwidmer	(*) details have to be figured out, especially wrt preparation time for slides etc
 cwidmer	sonney2k ping
@sonney2k	cwidmer, ?
@sonney2k	anyway no news from my side so I will keep you updated once I have more
 cwidmer	ok, great
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw we should use our shogun-ws mailinglist for QA
 cwidmer	so gunnar is in
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am ok with it
@sonney2k	as in everyone can send an email to this address and any of us can reply
@sonney2k	(using this address as from:)
 blackburn	sonney2k: but actually we should go away from mailing list
 cwidmer	let me know once everything is settled, so we can start advertising
 n4nd0	blackburn: why so? going away from mailing list
 blackburn	to something stackoverflow like
 blackburn	comparing to something SO-like it is impossible to find something discussed on mailing list
 cwidmer	metaoptimize?
 blackburn	cwidmer: yes
 cwidmer	I know the guy, btw
 cwidmer	met him at pydata
 cwidmer	I mean, we could monitor sites like that for a shogun tag
@sonney2k	blackburn, just google shogun toolbox stackoverflow
@sonney2k	anyways cu guys I need some rest
 cwidmer	n8n8
 n4nd0	sonney2k: night
 n4nd0	cwidmer, blackburn : so let's talk about tapkee for a little while?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: chris said to me already that he is busy till 13th
 n4nd0	ok
 cwidmer	n4nd0, I have an important deadline coming up, but after that I'm willing to help you guys push this out
 n4nd0	blackburn: during these days I will update the web info about PCA and KPCA
 n4nd0	cwidmer: cool
 blackburn	hmm that's nice n4nd0 - I'd appreciate help with website
 n4nd0	cwidmer: good luck for you deadline btw! (I am guessing some paper submission)
 cwidmer	it's a contribution to a vapnik 75th birthday "book"
 cwidmer	paper collection
 blackburn	n4nd0: cwidmer: so I do benchmarks again
 blackburn	put them to table
 blackburn	then once cwidmer has more spare time we pass through paper
 blackburn	and then submit
 n4nd0	it sounds like a good plan
 n4nd0	I am off for a shower, I will be back later
 blackburn	okay
 cwidmer	ok, guys, I'm off
