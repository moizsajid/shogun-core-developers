@lisitsyn	besser82: we can also send offensive mails to their mailing list
* besser82 writes a bot for that  :P
@lisitsyn	well your mom is so fat that she has a hundred virtualenvs in a thousand of dockers
@lisitsyn	and no virtualenv has sklearn installed!
@lisitsyn	besser82: ^ must piss them off :D
@besser82	hahahaha...  --  in soviet russia:  scikit imports you   :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^

@besser82	lisitsyn, 4 sure!  *rofl*
@lisitsyn	besser82: so people will be asking for some help as they don't understand
@lisitsyn	and we answer in russian as well
@besser82	lisitsyn, you can do that...  no one else in here...
@lisitsyn	or japanese as we are shogun
* besser82 at least doesn't speak russian nor japanese  :(
@lisitsyn	besser82: I thought you're native japanese speaker
@lisitsyn	how else did you come to develop shogun
@lisitsyn	really strange
@besser82	I thought all other devs here are girls  ^_^
@besser82	that's why I came  :P
