 sploving	hello sonney2k, when i installed atlas, it said, /root/atlas/../ATLAS//CONFIG/src/backend/comptestC.c:1: not implement to support 64 bit

 blackburn	got 4 :)
 sploving	blackburn, congratuation
 sploving	blackburn, do you know how to install atlas/
 blackburn	sploving: thanks
 blackburn	sorry fell asleep
 blackburn	well I just have installed it from my ubuntu repo

 sploving	blackburn, use apt-get?
 sploving	my computer is fedora, and my yum is broken. so I have to install it from source.
 in3xes	I've never seen a working yum :P
 sploving	which system you use? in3xes
 in3xes	I don't work on fedora much, but when ever I used...it was broken
 in3xes	sploving, ubuntu.
 in3xes	The bloated one :P
 sploving	I would not like to change my system as that might cost lot of time
 sploving	hello blackburn, another issue, are you around?

@sonney2k	blackburn, congrats
 blackburn	sonney2k: thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: today was asked by Chris about multi-core routines for eigenproblems
 blackburn	your opinion is use lapack by default, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is some parallel lapack
@sonney2k	scalapack IIRC
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is distributed-memory based lapack
 blackburn	there is PARPACK (P stands for parallel)
 blackburn	it is in debian repo
 blackburn	so not 'rare' lib
 blackburn	sonney2k: well defaults is: we use BLAS for matrix and vector operations and LAPACK for some LA routines, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	and if possible other libraries
@sonney2k	blackburn, anything compatible to lapack / blas can be used
@sonney2k	you actually don't even need to recompile
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	unfortunately lapack doesn't provide lanczos
 blackburn	so from mid of next week (just after my last exam) I'm going to start integrating it somehow
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess I will need some help from you - don't know much about how makefile provides these things
@sonney2k	blackburn, as I said just give me a snipped with arpack
@sonney2k	it is trivial
 blackburn	snipped?
@sonney2k	snippet
 blackburn	i.e. some code using arpack, right?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	parallel things is so scary forefront of development!
 blackburn	I guess we should do heavy parallel computing before 1.0.0
 blackburn	shouldn't*!
@sonney2k	ack
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I stumbled across a problem with SGMatrix
@sonney2k	for example the kernel has a function get_kernel_matrix()
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	which obviously should return a SGMatrix
 blackburn	exactly
@sonney2k	the problem is that this matrix will always be newly allocated
@sonney2k	and has to be freed
@sonney2k	this is in contrast to all the other get* functions we have
@sonney2k	happens so far in get_distance_matrix / get_kernel_matrix
 blackburn	yes I understand
 blackburn	sonney2k: well why not put it into destructor of SGMatrix?
@sonney2k	blackburn, but how does it know that it has to desctruct?
 blackburn	ah yes, interesting problem
 blackburn	sonney2k: why not store matrix in distance instance?
@sonney2k	or return a customkernel
@sonney2k	which has the kernel matrix inside
 blackburn	looks ugly
@sonney2k	but is at least consistent
 blackburn	sonney2k: well how you will get matrix if you will just return custom kernel?
@sonney2k	the function would have to go
@sonney2k	and one then uses k=CustomKernel(someotherkernelobj)
@sonney2k	k.get_kernel_matrix()
 blackburn	we should think about it.. it works but doesn't seems very consistent to me
@sonney2k	blackburn, this problem will re-occur whenever we have some function that returns sth that is on-the-fly computed
 blackburn	will create a ticket :)
 blackburn	nah later
 blackburn	have slept less than I need :D
 blackburn	going sleep now, see you sonney2k
