 wiking	sonney2k: btw if i get make a presentation about latent-so-svm in the workshop (i'd be happy to do it!), then i could use my travel budget to go to berlin on the workshop
 blackburn	wiking: hmm we should go for it I think

 wiking	blackburn: thnx for asking... yeah it's better now... but now i have like kazillion stuff to do
 wiking	oh cool i've just checked
 wiking	i have a direct flight to berlin
 wiking	and it's quite cheap as well
 wiking	i think i'll book this tomorrow
 wiking	as it's extremely cheap still
 wiking	it'd come on 11th of july and stay till the 14th
 blackburn	wiking: that's nice for you you can just book a flight :D
 wiking	blackburn: heheh u need visa?
 wiking	do u maybe need an invitation letter?
 wiking	i mean i can give you an invite letter (the more you have the better for you application i guess)
 wiking	but i'm not a resident of germany
 wiking	so i dont exactly know how this works
 wiking	as i guess you'll need a schengen visa
 wiking	not a german visa
 wiking	so if u can find out that it's ok to have another invitation letter from another schengen country
 wiking	then let me know
 wiking	and i'll write you one ASAP
 blackburn	wiking: I am thinking of just buying some tour
 blackburn	that matches 12th
 wiking	aaah
 wiking	and then they fix you all the papers
 wiking	good thinking
 blackburn	wiking: I have read something about it and it seems that getting visa with invitation and etc is kind of headache
 wiking	:S
 blackburn	for both invitee and inviter :)
 wiking	shit
 wiking	well if u need anything let me know
 wiking	as i can give u for sure an invitation
 blackburn	sure, thanks for such warm suggestion :)
 wiking	i've already done this to somebody
 wiking	so i have already a template invitation letter ;P
 wiking	but it's on english
 wiking	so maybe we'll need to translate it to german :>
 blackburn	wiking: well I think some company will settle all the things if I pretend to be just a tourist :)
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	that's for sure a good option
 wiking	they have all the connection etc
 blackburn	wiking: most inconvenient is to visit moscow to have an interview

 wiking	to make this thing go easy/smooth
 wiking	lol... that's really a shit
 blackburn	if I used some invitation I mean
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	yeah find yourself a nice tourist bus
 blackburn	iirc it is not needed if I just want to take photos and walk around :D
 wiking	with the old people in it; )
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	and just pretend that you are the grandson of one of the people on the bus
 blackburn	haha
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	well actually younger people are travelling from russia
 wiking	well u'll just right fit in then
 blackburn	heh yeah I hope so
 blackburn	russians are usually get out of country to get drunk
 blackburn	that's my life consists of so I will fit there :D
 blackburn	wiking: what is your plan for gsoc? :D
 n4nd0	do you guys know how do we fix accommodation during the workshop time in Berlin?
 n4nd0	I guess we are just into the wild and have to look for a hostel or sth for us
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah, sonney2k would not like to take care of that I am afraid :)
 n4nd0	hehe sure :)
 n4nd0	currently the idea is to be shogun-wise active the 12th and 13th right?
 wiking	blackburn: mentor
 wiking	blackburn: i'm not eligable for gsoc anymore
 blackburn	I am eligible but the same I guess
 blackburn	n4nd0: right
 n4nd0	wiking, blackburn: do you guys want to mentor me? :)
 wiking	n4nd0: if u wanna continue so
 blackburn	hah
 wiking	then i'm up for that
 blackburn	I'd need one guy for dimension reduction I think
 n4nd0	we should really start getting some project ideas
 n4nd0	that could wait for gsoc announcement though
 wiking	n4nd0: i saw 2 in the bug report of shogun on github
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?labels=GSoC+ideas&page=1&state=open
 wiking	3 even...
 n4nd0	density estimation
 blackburn	nah density estimation is easy-peasy
 wiking	smart ptrs :D
 blackburn	we need massive refactoring
 wiking	that'll be intersting :)
 blackburn	GPU and multicore
 wiking	*interesting
 wiking	blackburn: yep
 wiking	blackburn: both would be needed and good to have
 blackburn	I think we need general QP solver with an interface
 blackburn	and something general for learning problems
 n4nd0	blackburn: good idea
 n4nd0	the QP solver
 blackburn	but actually I have no feedback and I do not understand who is the user of shogun
 wiking	blackburn: hehehehe that's a good question
 wiking	blackburn: would b nice to have some download stats
 n4nd0	blackburn: I like pretty much the GPU idea too
 wiking	blackburn: do u have admin tab of https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: no
 blackburn	wiking: I have the following words in mind: provable, fast, well-tested, flexible

@sonney2k	blackburn, alright - I have two lines of code to trigger the issue
@sonney2k	    CDenseFeatures<float64_t>* features= new CDenseFeatures<float64_t>(matrix);
@sonney2k	    int ret = features->update_parameter_hash() ? 1 : 0;
@sonney2k	blackburn, wiking - btw are you aware of any kind of logging mechanism similar to log4j but for c++?
@sonney2k	one that doesn't need << >> crap thougH?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not but yes it is something nice to have
@sonney2k	would be nice to enable debugging just for certain parts of shogun (ok this works already but...)

 KMcQuisten	Afternoon, folks.
 KMcQuisten	Hope things are going well.
 KMcQuisten	So I got an email form the BuildBot saying that some changes I made are causing a test to fail, but I can't really see how that could be the case.  Anyone want to help me get to the bottom of this?
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, not your fault this time :D
 wiking	sonney2k: there's a good logger in libjingle project from google
@sonney2k	it is that nasty bug that is tough to debug
 KMcQuisten	Good.  I was wondering how changing a string in a model selection module made gaussian process regression break
 wiking	sonney2k: but it's quite coupled with the library itself :(
 wiking	sonney2k: log4cxx is good from apache
 KMcQuisten	especially after it seemed to build just fine locally
 KMcQuisten	Thanks :)
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, I wish I could resolve this issue quickly but I am on this for >1 week now making little progress
@sonney2k	but I have a two liner now to trigger the issue :)
 KMcQuisten	No worries, sonney.  It's not keeping me from getting any work done.  I was just worried I'd unwittingly broken things :)
@sonney2k	it has to do with registering vectorial parameters of type SGObject...
 KMcQuisten	Ah, I see
