 pickle27	sonney2k: still here?
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: Guest33531
 sonney2k	pickle27, yes sure ;)
 pickle27	hey, so I just updated the screen demo
 pickle27	and I am writing an email to the shogun list to checkout the demo
 pickle27	I sent 2 PRs against the shogun web repo that gets some data ready

 HeikoS1	pickle27: nice work!
 pickle27	thanks!
 HeikoS1	what else do you plan to do there?
 pickle27	I think its getting close to being done
 HeikoS1	pickle27: I also like those logs
 HeikoS1	cool, nice work
 HeikoS1	I did not even know you were after this
 pickle27	yeah I mean if anyone has anything they think should be different I'll try and get that in
 pickle27	otherwise I want to deploy shortly
 pickle27	like this week hopefully!
 HeikoS1	cool
 HeikoS1	Ill play a bit more
 HeikoS1	what are the most important changes?
 pickle27	mostly just the nav bar with the drop downs
 pickle27	a lot of the code has changed to make it simpler behind the scenes but visually its basically just the nav
 HeikoS1	ok
 HeikoS1	cool
 HeikoS1	pickle27: btw do you have access to our gsoc projcet list googledoc?
 pickle27	I do
 HeikoS1	pickle27: ok thats good. feel free to feedback things then :)
 pickle27	yeah I had a look through a while back
-!- zxtx [~zv@2607:ff38:3:811c:f4fd:b74f:f882:a9e6] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS1	pickle27: lots of things added, btw Im really looking forward to see this opencv stuff happening :)
 HeikoS1	pickle27: going to bed now, see you later!
 pickle27	later!
 sonney2k	pickle27, this page right http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org:1234/page/home/ ?
 sonney2k	pickle27, I don't see any updates?
 pickle27	it is mostly the same
 pickle27	there is a few small style changes on the subpages
 sonney2k	pickle27, I see
 sonney2k	pickle27, I am not yet (visually) happy
 pickle27	oh yeah? what do you want different?
 sonney2k	It should use more of the screen
 sonney2k	I mean boostrap stuff usually uses the full width
-!- HeikoS1 [~heiko@2.219.252.217] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 pickle27	hmmm okay
 sonney2k	pickle27, and the boxes are not aligned to anything
 sonney2k	pickle27, it is like wiking and lisitsyn1 being happy about http://deepmind.com/
 sonney2k	like full screen (ok this page there has no content...)
 pickle27	okay didn't know we wanted to go for that kind of style
 pickle27	I can see what I can do
 sonney2k	pickle27, well we have no direction or anything
 sonney2k	pickle27, I guess we will take whatever people like...
 pickle27	going wide like that might be a significant amount of workm what do you think about seeing what people have to say about what I have now
 sonney2k	pickle27, atm I would say the navbar is sth we want for sure - that really helps
 pickle27	make some small changes if required and then deploy
 sonney2k	pickle27, the boxes below could just stay so far
 pickle27	and I'll keep working
 pickle27	cause this is already going to be a pretty big deploy
 pickle27	so it would be good to get some of it out there
 pickle27	and then keep making more changes
 sonney2k	pickle27, well I guess the biggest change is the navbar isn't it?
 sonney2k	pickle27, I mean could you make a first iteration where just the navbar is changed on the front page?
 pickle27	yeah mostly what i've done is add the navbar and replace any old css with bootstrap
 sonney2k	pickle27, well I would immediately put the page live if it was just the changed nav bar.
 sonney2k	pickle27, the other design doesn't make me happy (yet)
 pickle27	hmm okay I'll cherry pick together a navbar PR then
 sonney2k	but maybe it is possible to just fix the design
 sonney2k	to look more like the old page
 sonney2k	as in get us the c-base workshop bar back
 sonney2k	pickle27, make the background white in the lower widgets
 sonney2k	pickle27, add these images to the background in the middle thing
-!- zxtx [~zv@2607:ff38:3:811c:f4fd:b74f:f882:a9e6] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
 sonney2k	pickle27, and make these 3 blocks in the middle aligned to the lower and upper stuff (so they start / end at the same x position)
 sonney2k	pickle27, and make the left/right knobs in the image scroll thing small again (like they were)
 sonney2k	pickle27, maybe that is not that much work even...
 pickle27	yeah it doesn't sound like too much
 sonney2k	I also realize that now the upper thing has a shadow
 sonney2k	or is kind of 3d
 sonney2k	and the others are flat
 sonney2k	yeah it is all just about some visual appearance
 pickle27	could you sum up all you want done and reply to the email with it? that way I'll remember it all
 sonney2k	pickle27, could you just save what I wrote I don't think I will come around and write this down again, sorry
 sonney2k	I rather need to sleep now too
 pickle27	sure I'll just reply it to the email myself
 pickle27	later!
 sonney2k	pickle27, thanks a lot
 sonney2k	pickle27, and yes great work and thanks for doing this!
 pickle27	no worries!

 Saurabh7	iglesiasg: hi
 Saurabh7	about the id3 implementaion, src/shogun/multiclass/tree/TreeMachineNode.h has only 2 childs of a node, which wont do, so what would be a good workaround?
@iglesiasg	hi Saurabh7
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, either make a new tree that supports more than 2 children and rename this one to BinaryTree blah blah
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, or make ID3 standalone, without inheriting from another tree machine
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, the first solution is neater if we plan to have more tree-based classifiers that use more than 2 children
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg: okay i ll make a new one based on the old one, just more children,thanks

 bluenotebook	Hello, I wanted to work on issue #1882 (https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1882) and will try to come up with something concrete over the coming week.
 bluenotebook	I wanted to inquire if there are others already working on it so that I could possibly help them come up with a solution faster
 bluenotebook	Or if there is anything else I should definitely know about the issue apart from what is mentioned at github or under the GSOC ideas page heading
 lisitsyn1	bluenotebook: it makes sense to leave some comment under this issue then!

 prams	I was reading through some papers from the deep learning reading list.. can you point me to any resources other than that..?

 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, and once done report back :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, sure, compiling latest with matlab on. It will take a bit while probably

 lisitsyn	150 is the number of what?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, installs in popcon
 lisitsyn	ah

 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, and some MatlabInterface.cpp.o
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, mm I don't see the MatlabInterface one
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, inside build directory?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, no idea... but libshogun is there?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, yes, a couple of libshogun.so.15 and the same with 16
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, so you did not start fresh
@iglesiasg	argh nope
@iglesiasg	I had to run cmake again
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, anyway then please do a mex with the libshogun.so and the MatlabInterface.cpp

 thoralf	Hey.
 sonney2k_	thoralf, ho
 pickle27	sonney2k_: updated the demo site with your changes
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I am happy
 sonney2k_	pickle27, lets merge it / put it live right away
 sonney2k_	pickle27, what is needed?
 pickle27	sonney2k_: did you check all the subpages?
 pickle27	some of the styling is different there now
 sonney2k_	pickle27, no which ones differ?
 pickle27	they are all sort of different now but you can get a feel by checking any of them
 pickle27	like about and the feature matrix
 sonney2k_	pickle27, we need some kind of bread crumb telling where one is
 pickle27	sonney2k_: sure that is pretty easy to add back
 sonney2k_	pickle27, well they look pretty similar to me
 pickle27	yeah they are pretty much the same
 sonney2k_	pickle27, can we somehow highlight the menu thing which one has clicked last?
 pickle27	I think so but I couldn't get it working
 pickle27	I'll take another look
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I am afraid we will only be able to make changes in the next few days.
 pickle27	what do you mean
 sonney2k_	pickle27, well lets merge now and you improve stuff
 sonney2k_	pickle27, tomorrow is notification deadline
 pickle27	yeah those 2 PRs need to be merged to set up the data
 sonney2k_	pickle27, which means *if* we get in
 pickle27	they won't change the site yet
 pickle27	I put the commands you need to run in the PR
 sonney2k_	we will be bombarded with other stuff
 sonney2k_	and we need students to find the page of course :)
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so lets do it all now
 pickle27	okay you merge those 2 while I add the bread crumbs
 sonney2k_	pickle27, oki mergin

 pickle27	yeah we just need to add those to the nav bar

 pickle27	hmmm okay
-!- zxtx [~zv@76.91.177.87] has joined #shogun
 pickle27	maybe my script didn't add the s's
 sonney2k_	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2014_ideas
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so we need the s
 sonney2k_	and pretty soon
 pickle27	its not letting me add them wtf
 pickle27	ahhhh
 pickle27	the field is too short
 pickle27	thats what all the crashes are from
 sonney2k_	pickle27, ahh sure
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so now what? I guess the database is pretty corrupt now?
 sonney2k_	pickle27, or can we somehow modify it / convert again?
 pickle27	nah it will be fine
 pickle27	I'll right an evolution to make the field bigger
 pickle27	then I'll edit the fields manually
 pickle27	its just a few missing chars
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so it is just a few fields ok
 lisitsyn	hey guys
 pickle27	sonney2k_: sent the PR
 lisitsyn	that's pretty cool with new design
 pickle27	lisitsyn: thanks

 pickle27	sonney2k_: can you run my evolution
 pickle27	so I can fix the pages that are not loading
 sonney2k_	pickle27, which one?
 pickle27	I updated the sequence so just run ./manage evolve --execute after deploying
 sonney2k_	pickle27, done
 pickle27	kk
 pickle27	Im fixing the paths now
 pickle27	should be good in 5 mins
 pickle27	okay pages are loading again
 sonney2k_	pickle27, we need gsoc2014 back :)
 pickle27	yup I'll add that rihgt ow
 sonney2k_	pickle27, there is also sth weird in news - tehre is no year 2013 in there?!
 sonney2k_	pickle27, blog has an empty breadcrump
 pickle27	yeah I have the breadcrumb as sth to fix
 sonney2k_	pickle27, and i think we should have contact with sub pages so irclogs etc are immediately visiable in the menu
 pickle27	yeah thats doable
 pickle27	GSoC 2014 is back
 sonney2k_	pickle27, then maybe it is me but the page feels pretty sluggish now?!
 pickle27	umm it takes a second to load
 pickle27	there is a lot of images to load, I didn't change much there
 sonney2k_	pickle27, next thing is the overlay is gone that we had when you click on a notebook
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so you can no longer say open in shogun cloud etc
 sonney2k_	pickle27, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo gives an exception
 pickle27	yeah I have that written down too
 sonney2k_	pickle27, and we need a white background - this looks really messy http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook

 sonney2k_	pickle27, but when you click on sth the overlay doesn't open
 sonney2k_	nothing happens actually
 pickle27	okay I'll try and figure that out

 sonney2k_	pickle27, seems like it is no longer picking the overlay div http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/js/overlay.js
 pickle27	hmmm kk
 pickle27	I might have accidently removed an include
 sonney2k_	pickle27, but I can see it...
 pickle27	maybe its relying on a div thats not there anymore
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I also see it

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: fix the breadcrumbs not showing on some pages
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I guess that is why the page feels slow now
 pickle27	maybe
 sonney2k_	pickle27, before that we had the overlay.js includes etc at the very top
 pickle27	okay lets put it back up there then
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I would do that again but just keep mathjax and analytics at the bottom

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: moved overlay js back to the top
 pickle27	okay lets try that now
 sonney2k_	pickle27, there is something weird going on - when I reload the page I can see some color gradient at the top which then later vanishes...
 sonney2k_	or white background or sth
 sonney2k_	like kind of a flashing
 pickle27	hmm doesn't happen for me
 sonney2k_	pickle27, only see that in chrome...
 sonney2k_	pickle27, you firefox?
 pickle27	Im chrome
 pickle27	on linux
 sonney2k_	pickle27, version?
 pickle27	Version 33.0.1750.117
 sonney2k_	32.0.1700.107 here
 sonney2k_	pickle27, could there be a naming clash with bootstrap and overlay?
 pickle27	it is possible
 pickle27	bootstrap has an overlay class too
 pickle27	maybe we should switch to it
 sonney2k_	pickle27, currently 'open in shogun cloud etc are gone...' and demos don't work but I dont' see why...
 sonney2k_	maybe jsut debug the .js is good http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I see that it is being called - so it must be some interaction with bootstrap or maybe you did delete the overlay div from the page
 pickle27	okay I'll look into it in one sec

 sonney2k_	pickle27, ok in the carousel it is definitely deactivated
 sonney2k_	pickle27, look at view-source:https://web.archive.org/web/20140104130005/http://shogun-toolbox.org/
 pickle27	I also removed a overlay file
 sonney2k_	and then search for overlay
 sonney2k_	pickle27, the overlay-iframe is still there
 sonney2k_	but not the <a class="overlay"  in the carousel
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I guess adding that would fix it
 pickle27	yeah maybe
 pickle27	trying it now
 sonney2k_	pickle27, and indeed the overlay-iframe is gone in shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo / notebook
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so that is why it doesn't work there
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so if you add that back in it works

 sonney2k_	pickle27, well news doesn't have 2013 nor 2014
 pickle27	I added 2013
 sonney2k_	pickle27, but apart from that it looks good
 pickle27	I'll add 2014
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I dont' understand why the page is so slow still but good enough for sure... I remember that my last benchmarks with the pages would be able to handle 100 pageviews / second
 pickle27	hmm yeah that is weird
 pickle27	cause we're loading less css now I think
 pickle27	maybe I can load only the bootstrap we need
 sonney2k_	pickle27, but for some reason chrome now says it is waiting for 1 second until the page is loaded
 sonney2k_	and that is w/o jquery / bootstrap
 pickle27	hmm lets profile it with chrome dev tools and see what is slow
 sonney2k_	pickle27, just try yourself
 sonney2k_	yeah it is slow loading /page/home/
 sonney2k_	but why?
 pickle27	no idea
 sonney2k_	everything altogether takes 2.6s
