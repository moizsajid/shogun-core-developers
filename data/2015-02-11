@besser82	lisitsyn, yes I do ^^
@lisitsyn	actually I compiled debug python here as well
@lisitsyn	besser82: are you on mac?
@besser82	lisitsyn, Fedora is superior platform for developing & stuff  :P
@lisitsyn	hmm it happens on fedora as wll?
@besser82	lisitsyn, nope, nothing with bitten fruits in my house ^^
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes
@lisitsyn	well
@lisitsyn	cool
@lisitsyn	swig is b0rken?
@besser82	lisitsyn, since SWIG >= 3
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	so we fork swig and voila?
@besser82	lisitsyn, or sg-swig-shiatz  :P
@lisitsyn	we have a lot of man power
@besser82	lisitsyn, shogun-modular-interface-genrator  :P
@lisitsyn	lets just write another swuieg
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	smig
@besser82	lol XD
@besser82	lisitsyn, but that shaitz only happenes with sg_py_mod
@besser82	lisitsyn, newer seen it with other swig-generated stuff over here  :(
@lisitsyn	besser82: well with py debug it sounds easier
@besser82	lisitsyn, just checked a few swig-generated-py-interfaces from other pkgs and they do not segfault  :P
@lisitsyn	can you show lines around crash?
@lisitsyn	may be we will get any idea
@besser82	lisitsyn, lemme finish running the testsuite  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, I'll upload test.log afterwards...

@besser82	lisitsyn, yay :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, how we fix that?!?  :P
@lisitsyn	it is swig then :D
@lisitsyn	no I mean it is much easier to debug
@besser82	lisitsyn, ?
@lisitsyn	besser82: it is wrapper code that blows it
@lisitsyn	not python
@besser82	lisitsyn, so swig generates invalid code?
@lisitsyn	looks like
@lisitsyn	let me try on my machine
@besser82	lisitsyn, mmmh...  yeah do it  =)
@besser82	lisitsyn, I can upload unittest-debug.log && modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx later, if that helps?
@lisitsyn	besser82: yeah please
@lisitsyn	I think I have some idea how to approach it
@besser82	lisitsyn, stuff is generated with vanilla swig-3.0.5
@besser82	lisitsyn, as far as I can see for now:  It's always crashing @ _wrap_delete_%{shogun_class}

 qachen	Hi. I have a problem in installing(or compiling) shogun. In my Arch OS, I have installed two versions of python(3.4, 2.7). When I follow the instructions in shogun github wiki, the shogun python module is installed on python3 package location. How can I change this to python2?
@besser82	qachen, just a moment
@besser82	qachen, add `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE="$path_to_python2_exec"` to your cmake-invocation and recompile
@besser82	qachen, e.g. mkdir build && pushd build && cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE="/usr/bin/python2" .. && make
@besser82	qachen, that will compile python_modular for Python2.X
@lisitsyn	besser82: what about python libraries?
@lisitsyn	will it link proeprly?
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes linking goes fine
@lisitsyn	I mean you just give it binary and all goes well?
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes
@lisitsyn	magic
@besser82	lisitsyn, the compiled object from swig-code links with no issues
@besser82	lisitsyn, or what is the point of your question?
@lisitsyn	besser82: I mean how it finds libraries? with that PYTHON_EXECUTABLE
@besser82	lisitsyn, ahhh...
@besser82	lisitsyn, that's cmake magic  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, cmake probes the version of that exec
@lisitsyn	sounds like magic for sure :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, and then checks for the libs with matching version
@lisitsyn	besser82: I fail here
@lisitsyn	    frame #4: 0x000000010200a43f _modshogun.so`init_modshogun + 159 at modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx:777240
@besser82	lisitsyn, mhh...
@besser82	lisitsyn, you can run testsuite with debugging?
@lisitsyn	well that's on import
@lisitsyn	they will fail just with the same thing
@besser82	ok...
-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@122.168.86.42] has joined #shogun
@besser82	for me import works...
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@lisitsyn	ok then they are either different or not
@besser82	lisitsyn, but testsuite goes down with the wrapper issues
@besser82	lisitsyn, what before frame 4?
 qachen	besser82, thanks for you help. Now I have to cook my dinner, I will check that latter and give you some feedback. :)
@lisitsyn	besser82:  777240   metatype = (PyTypeObject *) PyType_Type.tp_call((PyObject *) &PyType_Type, metatype_args, NULL);
@besser82	qachen, allrighty ^^  yw!
@lisitsyn	hmm I closed lldb
@lisitsyn	some python code
@lisitsyn	but that's wrapper code that fails
@besser82	lisitsyn, ---> metatype_args    --   looks suspiciously the same...

@besser82	lisitsyn, will do so  ;)
@lisitsyn	besser82: okay so metatype_args are good
@lisitsyn	but metatype is not
@besser82	lisitsyn, :/
@besser82	lisitsyn, you didn't push yet :(
@lisitsyn	besser82: no
@lisitsyn	just started it
@lisitsyn	I want optional aka maybe to be in shogun
@besser82	ahh... I see ^^
@besser82	lisitsyn, so not python-related, rye?
@lisitsyn	no
@lisitsyn	still need to fix that
@lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	lisitsyn, XD
@lisitsyn	absolutely no idea how
@besser82	lisitsyn, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liLU2tEz7KY  :P
@lisitsyn	besser82: these rap battles are a bit boring for me :)
@besser82	lisitsyn, in america that's called "foul language"; in soviet-russia it's supposed be posh vocabs, rye?  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, don't like rap / hiphop stuff?
@besser82	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2697
@besser82	lisitsyn, merge?
@besser82	lisitsyn, I can do myself, but want your oppinion first
@lisitsyn	besser82: I like some kind of hiphop actually
@lisitsyn	besser82: I am confused why gdb is related to python debug?
@besser82	lisitsyn, because the python-debugger (pdb) is related for python-code only

 qachen	besser82, my shogun python warpper seems not working, it reports that "no module named modshugun".

(5) cd ..; python2.7 examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/svm.py
 qachen	Are the following command necessary: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUN_INSTALL_DIR/lib; export PYTHONPATH=SHOGUN_INSTALL_DIR/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages/ ?
@besser82	qachen, depends on your distro's default PYTHONPATH...  I don't know, what's setup on Arch Linux as defalt...
@besser82	qachen, possibly "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages" isn't included there

@STDROCCurve	swagg_regressor,     ^ SWIG brings in Meth  :S  That's why everything is b0rk3n  :P
 qachen	oh.. How to solve this problem, it is difficult ?

@swagg_regressor	STDROCCurve: meth yolo!
@STDROCCurve	qachen, the problem with that is quite difficult to solve, since we need to make sure we have no errors in swig-meta-files
 qachen	lol
@STDROCCurve	qachen, with swig <= 3  all was fine
@STDROCCurve	qachen, with swig >= 3 python-interfaces are broken
 qachen	OK, I will try to build with swig < 3
@STDROCCurve	qachen, we suspect swig to generate broken _wrap_delete_* functions

@SWAGGRegation	HeikoS, py_mod segfaulting with SWIG3

@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, so...  my suspicion has come proven
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, args=0x0  --->  turns out to bring:  Address 0x8 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
@swagg_noregrets	well yeah
@swagg_noregrets	SWAGGRegation: working with 0x0 is yolo
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, well but the real question is:  Why is PyObject* args == NULL  ?!?
@swagg_noregrets	yolo
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, so segfault is coming on shutdown
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, so it looks like the problem is coming from our code...  :(
@swagg_noregrets	yeah probably but no idea why
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, lemme do that by step by step gdb-run...  possibly we find the reason there
@HeikoS	hey sergey
@HeikoS	can you put together some bullet points on the parameter framework and d-pointer stuff?
@HeikoS	I can write a text from this
@HeikoS	but need some points to start from
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, installing additional debuginfo stuff...
@SWAGGRegation	swagg_noregrets, coming closer to that
@swagg_noregrets	HeikoS: yes
@swagg_noregrets	no not but yes
