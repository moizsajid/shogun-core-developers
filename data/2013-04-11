 medeeiip	hello..........
 medeeiip	Actually after a whole day.... my working for porting shogun to windows was hopeless
 medeeiip	though I've one good thing
 medeeiip	I've created a CMakeList
 medeeiip	through which effecient working on windows is possible....
 medeeiip	actually It should be possible in every cmake supported platform.... though I've not tested.....
 medeeiip	on other platform

 abinashpanda	Ok
 n4nd0	abinashpanda: There is no specific number of contributions you need to do in order to get accepted. It is mainly common sense - the more you contribute, the more likely it is you will be selected.
 abinashpanda	Ok, then could you please guide me through the total process of patch submission and review,etc
 n4nd0	abinashpanda: are you used to using git and github?
 abinashpanda	yes I am used to git and github
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	then fork shogun, clone locally
 abinashpanda	ok
 n4nd0	set up git flow (we have just established this development process, see mailing list for more info)
 n4nd0	do a patch and a pull request
 abinashpanda	ok

 medeeiip	hello everyone, after a whole day.... my working for porting shogun to windows was quite hopeless.....

 medeeiip	sonne|work: I've alomost complete cmake.... should i submit it?
 sonne|work	medeeiip: isn't there a cmake list already?
 medeeiip	yes there is..................... but in the cmake there is only two lines...... and in this channel.... i's told a couple of days earlier that the cmake here is far from complete..........
 medeeiip	actually
 medeeiip	the camke was just
 medeeiip	min_req(2.8)
 medeeiip	add_proj(shogun)
 medeeiip	so, it wasn't working
 n4nd0	medeeiip: Have you got to work all shogun with cmake?
 medeeiip	yes....in my windows system my cmakelist done everything smoothly.......
 medeeiip	config file created
 n4nd0	medeeiip: Do you happen to have the chance to try it out in linux as well?
 n4nd0	medeeiip: if not you can put it somewhere and I can try it now
 medeeiip	Ok!............ i'm sending the link of my forked git copy

 medeeiip	1 point......... I could not add installation prefix of lzo2 and gzip.....
 medeeiip	and as of now .... no xml.... though I'can add it.. within a couple of hour ( i think....)
 n4nd0	medeeiip: https://github.com/medeep/shogun/blob/master/src/CMakeLists.txt is this the cmake you have modified?
 sonne|work	medeeiip: ok I see
 medeeiip	yes......
 foulwall	sonne|work: hi!
 foulwall	sonne|work: I'm looking for what i can do next
 sonne|work	foulwall: hey there!
 sonne|work	nice work - I looked at your demo
 sonne|work	you might not need to store stuff in mysql but just internally in some .js array
 sonne|work	and then add some button to submit the data
 foulwall	sonne|work: Hmm
 sonne|work	that then does the json transmission
 n4nd0	medeeiip: so I've just run cmake here and there were some errors
 medeeiip	can you tell me what?
 sonne|work	then on the server side you receive all these points
 n4nd0	medeeiip: in case I did something wrong. I cd to src, created build directory, cd to build and cmake ..
 medeeiip	have you copied the CMake directory?
 n4nd0	medeeiip: no, I only did what I have told you :) where should I copy it?
 sonne|work	foulwall: then you could run shogun on the server
 sonne|work	foulwall: http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/python_modular_examples.html#python_modular_regression_examples
 sonne|work	regression_libsvr_modular.py
 n4nd0	medeeiip: I think what I did is the normal practice to build a project with cmake
 sonne|work	feeding it this data on input
 foulwall	sonne|work: ok!
 medeeiip	yes...... but I made things moduler
 sonne|work	foulwall: there is also a graphical example for that which you should have a look at
 medeeiip	and there is some script inside
 foulwall	sonne|work: easy to do that, and return a graphic feedback?
 medeeiip	src/CMake
 sonne|work	python_modular/graphical/interactive_svr_demo.py
 n4nd0	medeeiip: tell me how should I build it then
 sonne|work	foulwall: so you could then just apply the learned model to the current x range
 medeeiip	either copy the dir named CMake into src
 sonne|work	and plot a the learned curve
 medeeiip	or copy the whole rpo from git
 sonne|work	foulwall: yes exactly
 n4nd0	medeeiip: I have copied your whole repo from git
 n4nd0	medeeiip: not just the CMakeLists.txt of course
 foulwall	sonne|work: Ok, give me a few hours and i'll show you the demo.
 n4nd0	medeeiip: I have cloned your repo locally and done the steps I told you above
 sonne|work	foulwall: would be cool!
 medeeiip	n4nd0: ok! then pls...... allow me a couple of hour......I'm testing it on a linux machine....
 medeeiip	n4nd0: btw can you tell me what is the error?
 n4nd0	medeeiip: sure, no need to rush :)
 n4nd0	medeeiip: http://pastebin.com/vv55VxFJ
 medeeiip	n4nd0: thank you...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hi, Heiko pointed out that the more linkin GSoC in the homepage lead to a wrong place. I pushed sth to shogun-web
 sonne|work	n4nd0: where did it point to?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: examples
* sonne|work checks
 sonne|work	ohh
 sonne|work	we have to make that examples link stuff much better

 blackburn	sonne|work: I came with better syntax for tapkee API

 blackburn	sonne|work: and static structs as keywords
 blackburn	that implement operator=(..)
 sonne|work	unreadable C++ but nice syntax :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: well it is PITA for developers but nice for users
 shrey	Hi, sonney2k.
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'd definitely not use it in shogun API but I am excited to know it is possible
 blackburn	and I'll use it in tapkee
 sonne|work	Hi shrey!
 shrey	hi sonne|work. i had rustled up a mockup based on my conversation with sonney2k.
 shrey	i would like you to have a look at it.i have created a repo on github.
 sonne|work	shrey: yeah that's me too :)
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	uhuha
 sonne|work	shrey, nice work btw :)
 shrey	okay
 shrey	thank you.
 sonne|work	what you could do is this http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/examples
 sonne|work	down below in applications
 sonne|work	we have this flash thingy
 sonne|work	where one can paint a digit
 sonne|work	and it will recognize the digit
 shrey	yes.
 sonne|work	so basically you allow free hand drawing with the mouse
 shrey	okay
 sonne|work	and then scale it down to 16x16 pixel matrix like you have
 sonne|work	shrey: or a bit easier - you would create a colorful matrix plot like this here http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/examples
 blackburn	have you all guys seen http://www.agner.org/optimize/?
 sonne|work	so you have say 100x100 bigger pixels and these all get some color value
 shrey	i am sorry but i dont see the colorful matrix plot.
 sonne|work	instead of pixels I meant blocks
 sonne|work	shrey: http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/figures/reduced/MatlabDemo300x100.png
 shrey	okay
 sonne|work	http://shogun-toolbox.org/bigpicture/krr.png
 sonne|work	shrey: ^
 sonne|work	this is from some shogun example but done with matplotlib
 sonne|work	http://matplotlib.org/
 shrey	ok.
 shrey	but if all the blocks get the same coulour value, then how will the image show up?
 shrey	*color
 sonne|work	shrey: no they don't get all the same color
 sonne|work	each block gets a different one
 shrey	okay.
 shrey	on it.

 shaumik	hi!
 n4nd0	hey shaumik
 shaumik	i am interested in developing ml demos, and i just sent an introduction mail
 shaumik	i just wanted to know if there are any patches i need to submit first
 n4nd0	very good
 n4nd0	shaumik: yes, you need to submit patches as part of your GSoC application
 shaumik	since this is a django based project, should i submit a python related patch?
 shaumik	and as I am new to machine learning, is there anything easy to do?
 n4nd0	shaumik: you could start by doing some demo, so you can use python or d3.js
 shaumik	i am comfortable in python, but i haven't used d3.js before.
 n4nd0	shaumik: maybe some binary classification example is good to start
 shaumik	i haven't yet cloned the repository, could you tell me how to proceed.
 shaumik	i have forked it on github, and will clone it of course
 shaumik	what i mean is that should i make the demo as a part of shogun
 n4nd0	shaumik: if you have already made the fork then just do
 shaumik	one more thing, would the project be a different project in django altogether?
 n4nd0	git clone git://github.com/<your github username>/shogun.git
 n4nd0	shaumik: I don't understand what you mean in the last question
 shaumik	i think i should just read on binary classification first,

 n4nd0	Yanglittle: Hi! It seems to run fine here. I guess you changed the input data, didn't you?
 Yanglittle	NO, I download it from here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data/tree/master/toy
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: are you giving strings? It seems that in the files fm_train_real.dat and fm_test_real.dat the input are numbers
 Yanglittle	I did nothing
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: if you use git
 sonne|work	you could just have done
 sonne|work	git pull
 sonne|work	and then
 n4nd0	Yanglittle: can you copy somehwere the version of mkl_multiclass_modular you are using
 sonne|work	git submodule update --init
 medeeiip__	n4nd0: I've updatd the cmakelist and currently i've tested it under ubuntu 12..... it worked...

 shrey	thanx.i would say that i am proficient enough.i have used django for various projects, primarily for the college sites of our fests.
 shrey	what would matrix transfer mean?
 sonne|work	shrey: you could just transfer some array with colors
 shrey	render the matrix with colors from the server end.is that what you mean?
 sonne|work	shrey: no you render it with d3js on the client
 sonne|work	but on the server you create the matrix with colrs
 sonne|work	colors
 shrey	okay
 sonne|work	and transfer it e.g. by pressing some button
 blackburn	sonne|work: this idea could be extended actually
 blackburn	with providing a web service api for shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn: which idea?
 blackburn	sonne|work: demos
 sonne|work	blackburn: sure
 sonne|work	blackburn: do we want that?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am undecided about that at all
 sonne|work	sure one could do cool stuff
 sonne|work	like upload you kaggle data
 sonne|work	and we give you some result :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: well anyway I believe we should somehow get to client-server
 foulwall	which version is the shogun in gentoo portage?
 sonne|work	foulwall: I didn't even know there is one in gentoo?
 foulwall	sonne|work: or maybe i haven't sync a lone time... current version on my server is 1.1
 foulwall	sonne|work: i'll compile it.
 foulwall	sonne|work: from source.
 sonne|work	foulwall: you should get it from source anyways
 sonne|work	and then just compile for python_modular, i.e.
 sonne|work	./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 foulwall	sonne|work: thankyou.
 blackburn	1.1 hmm
 blackburn	sonne|work: when did we release 1.1?
 blackburn	in 1997 or what?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	before gsoc 2012 actually?
 sonne|work	blackburn: no we didn't manage to release before gsoc2012
 sonne|work	(bad bad...)
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	1.0 is after gsoc 2011

 shrey	i have come up with an implementation to the defining matrix on the server problem.have a look .    https://github.com/shrey-rajvanshi/shogun
 n4nd0	shrey: now it runs much faster, right?
 shrey	u define the characteristics of the matrix(start (x,y), color, cell(width,height) etc)  on the server end
 shrey	yes
 n4nd0	shrey: is it running faster also because the square is smaller?
 shrey	the random button is like superfast
 shrey	maybe
 shrey	let us test it for 50 X 50 matrix
-!- medeeiip [~medeeiip@103.2.135.66] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
 n4nd0	shrey: let's see :)
 shrey	:(
 shrey	well yes,it was because of the matrix.
 shrey	still takes like one complete second for a 100X100 matrix :(
 shrey	the random generator is still on the client side.so that wont make a difference.
 shrey	only the matrix definition is on the server end.
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I don't think that the number generation itself is what takes that time, but I am not sure
 shrey	it has to assign a random color to each and every cell.that is what should take time.everything else is just a one time process.

 blackburn	heiko: how do I know what?
 heiko	blackburn: how did you know that I pushed them?
 blackburn	heiko: there should be a reason they registered at the same time? ;)
 heiko	erlenda: so we already got a guy that is getting into Gaussians - he is doing introduction tasks that we defined on github - computing logdet for medium sparse matrices, sampling gaussians with medium sparse matrices etc
 heiko	blackburn: ah they registered :) I didnt know that
 blackburn	heiko: I said I added them ;)
 heiko	cool!
 blackburn	I can't add anyone if he didn't request it

 blackburn	gaussian party
 heiko	erlenda: and also importing eliptic curve stuff, checking out solvers

 heiko	one on the web-stuff
 heiko	or two doing both but different demos

 blackburn	heiko: depends on # of slots I think?
 heiko	blackburn: yes, but just wondering
 heiko	since so many people are asking
 heiko	also we really lack this
 blackburn	heiko: I am afraid we lack something else

@sonney2k	foulwall, so did it go through?
 foulwall	sonney2k: will finish soon.
@sonney2k	foulwall, compiling for 1.5hrs?
 foulwall	ah
 n4nd0	wouldn't be surprised :D
 foulwall	compile is already finished.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, haha!
 foulwall	I'm working on the svr demo.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, not even an old ppc or mips machine would be *that* slow
 n4nd0	sonney2k: jk hehe
@sonney2k	foulwall, yeah no worries
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but actually before I realized my swap was not activated, taking into account the times make crashed due to out of memory error, I think once or twice it took be more than half an hour to compile
 n4nd0	took me* more
 n4nd0	hey medeeiip
 n4nd0	I can try again in my machine
 n4nd0	medeeiip: errors again unfortunately, http://pastebin.com/TKume8bh
 n4nd0	blackburn, heiko : nice thing about the demos/examples project is that it shouldn't be too hard to mentor
 n4nd0	IMHO
 n4nd0	so the idea of having more than project about that (providing enough slots) can be a good one I think
-!- madhura [~madhura@59.95.234.174] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah the question is in slots
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah but that was for octave! foulwall only needs python_modular
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I actually run in the same problem only with python_modular IIRC, but my browser was *overloaded* with tabs
 foulwall	sonney2k: Maybe the ram is not efficient. only 512MB
 n4nd0	anyway I think that is probably my bad. 4GB RAM is not too much, and no swap
@sonney2k	n4nd0, our buildbot also only has 4GB...
 n4nd0	oh shit 521MB and I was saying 4GB is not a lot :S
 blackburn	512? is it a phone?
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha we should put that
 n4nd0	shogun in your phone
 foulwall	haha
 n4nd0	want to do some MKL in the subway?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actaully shogun does run on gunnars iphone
@sonney2k	first generation :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am dreaming about that - remember my client-server obsession
 n4nd0	sonney2k: cool, is it just to show off or he is actually using it for anything?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, jsut to show off :)
 n4nd0	It could be cool to show in the workshop!
@sonney2k	well we have no applications demos :D
@sonney2k	so it is no use
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: btw as I got totally mad I think I'll rather present my ideas on API during the workshop
 n4nd0	will be happy to hear :)
 medeeiip	n4nd0: can u tell me what is the general installetion path of hdf5 in linux........ I've tried these paths.......:  $ENV{HOME}/.local
 medeeiip	    $ENV{HDF5_ROOT}
 medeeiip	    $ENV{HDF5_ROOT_DIR_HINT}
 medeeiip	    /usr/lib/hdf5
 medeeiip	    /usr/share/hdf5
 medeeiip	    /usr/local/hdf5
 medeeiip	    /usr/local/hdf5/share
 n4nd0	medeeiip: in my machine whereis hdf5 tells me /usr/include/hdf5.h
 n4nd0	but I think that cmake should have some tricks to look for those kind of things more or less automatically
 medeeiip	i's searching by env variable also............
 blackburn	n4nd0: why do you call it tricks ;)
 blackburn	it is the work of cmake to handle that
 n4nd0	I like magic :)
 blackburn	http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/h4toh5/src/unpacked/config/cmake/FindHDF5.cmake
 n4nd0	medeeiip: but is there supposed to be an env variable for hdf5?
 blackburn	here comes a finder

 n4nd0	that is the sort of demo I was waiting for but I did not expect to see one so soon!
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes that's really fast
 n4nd0	blackburn: but how is that done? django/d3?
 n4nd0	I am going to check closer
 blackburn	n4nd0: jquery
 blackburn	n4nd0: nothing to do with django here :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: nor d3 either hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: d3 plots the stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: but is this calling really shogun code every time we say regression?
 blackburn	n4nd0: jquery does ajax stuff
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham, I understand
 n4nd0	oh this is awesome stuff
 blackburn	n4nd0: ah probably that's django on the server side
 blackburn	as a web service
 blackburn	I do not know
 blackburn	there are a lot of ways to do that
 n4nd0	I want to ask foulwall
 n4nd0	tom probably
 n4nd0	blackburn: this is the kind of thind I told you about for tapkee web
 n4nd0	we put some points around in 2D and embed to a line
 blackburn	n4nd0: 2d -> 1d?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	no real use
 n4nd0	but I don't know how to do an interactive example otherwise
 blackburn	n4nd0: static is ok

 medeeiip__	lisitsyn: IMHO contribution means?
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: well we don't know how many slots we will receive
@lisitsyn	yes contribution is very important
@lisitsyn	we are searching for long-term contributors so we'd like to work with motivated people

 medeeiip__	lisitsyn: I'm a engineering student with c++ skills but with very basic knowledge of ML.... So i want to contribute to the project idea on "improving file handling"..... Is that project has priority....
 medeeiip__	i mean as u said :well we don't know how many slots we will receive
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: from past experience we usually do not choose ideas but students
 medeeiip__	lisitsyn: what if two students have submitted the same proposal and both are very good?
 iglesiasg	the old coin flip :P
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: sounds very hypothetical :)
 iglesiasg	just kidding
 medeeiip__	:D
 medeeiip__	lisitsyn: let be very frank.... as I said I've very basic knowledge of ML, So i gs there would be almost no chance for me to contribute in a long term..... So may I've a chance as you said: we are searching for long-term contributors so we'd like to work with motivated people
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: no, why? we have not that much on ML itself
@lisitsyn	it is all about the infrastructure
@lisitsyn	it takes most time usually
 medeeiip__	OK! one technical question: can shogun be built without hdf5?
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: yes of course
 medeeiip__	lisitsyn: I'm interested about porting shogun to windows. So first of all I needed a config generator like cmake. I've written a cmakelist which works on windows but as n4nd0 said that failed on linux for hdf5 . So I've rewritten it. Can you plese check it...if u have time?
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: let me check it a bit later
@lisitsyn	medeeiip__: don't you have linux?
 medeeiip__	actually i have. but i couldn't installed hdf5
 medeeiip__	with my cmakelist everything is okey without hdf5
 medeeiip__	as it does not provide a cmake module by default
@lisitsyn	give me a link to your git please
 medeeiip__	sure
 medeeiip__	https://github.com/medeep/shogun
@lisitsyn	cloning
 iglesiasg	medeeiip__: I have just tried again, cmake worked fine but unfortunately make failed :(
 medeeiip__	complaining about?
 iglesiasg	I am n4nd0 btw :)
 iglesiasg	medeeiip__: http://pastebin.com/c58dabgQ
 iglesiasg	I included both cmake and make traces
 iglesiasg	medeeiip__: out of curiosity, let me ask you, do you have previous experience preparing cmake for a big project like shogun or are you drawing inspiration from other open source project that supports cmake?
 medeeiip__	no... I've worked in any...... so my code quality may be poor
 iglesiasg	aham I see
 medeeiip__	but see cmake is note generating files like RInterface.h
 medeeiip__	and the problem is with that...
 medeeiip__	so where may b the prob?
 iglesiasg	medeeiip__: no idea really, I have not looked at your CMakeLists files
 iglesiasg	I am no cmake expert either. I have just used it in small projects
 medeeiip__	btw is my code very poor????????? Plese be frank
 iglesiasg	I don't know much about cmake so my opinion is not probably good regarding that

 iglesiasg	I don't think it looks poor at first sight, normal cmake code
