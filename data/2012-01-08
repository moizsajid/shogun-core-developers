 blackburn	damn
@sonney2k	kate_, gcc 4.x ?
 blackburn	AH!
 blackburn	YES
 blackburn	wrong gcc version!
 blackburn	kate_: git checkout src/
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	git checkout shogun
 blackburn	kate_: then install gcc of version 4
 kate_	??
 kate_	version 4
 kate_	now configure and then make?
 blackburn	yes
 kate_	swig error : Unrecognized option -builtin
 kate_	why?
 blackburn	kate_: old swig..
 kate_	i ll do whatever you tell me
 blackburn	kate_: is there swig 2.0?
 kate_	in the pkg?
 blackburn	inviting promises hah
 blackburn	yes
 kate_	no
 kate_	there's no swig 2.0
 blackburn	bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: whhat to do?
 blackburn	kate_: http://cygwin.com/packages/swig/ there is 2.0.0-1, may be there is a way to install 2.0?
 kate_	i tried a few mirror sites all of them have 1.3.4
 blackburn	damn :(
 kate_	no what?
 blackburn	kate_: I am afraid you have to install it manually http://www.swig.org/download.html
 kate_	can you walk me through it?
 blackburn	I'm pretty blind with it - I'm running ubuntu , but I'll try
 blackburn	kate_: but remove swig 1.3 first
 kate_	running the .exe file
 kate_	?
 blackburn	yes, I think so
 kate_	ok
 blackburn	swigwin
 kate_	-bash: swigwin: command not found
 blackburn	no, I mean swigwin from the swig site
 kate_	wait there is a manual i think!
 blackburn	should be
 kate_	ok
 kate_	it told me to unzip the file to a directory..nothing else
 kate_	there should be although an .exe file according to the manual
 kate_	2.0.4 didn't have an .exe so i downloaded the 2.0.1
 kate_	if swig is installed

 shogun-buildbot	build #112 of nightly_none is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/112
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding kate's problem yesterday
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes?
@sonney2k	I did install swig 2.0.4 on cygwin
@sonney2k	that worked just fine
 blackburn	manually?
@sonney2k	but one needs to compile everything from source
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	yes, I wanted to suggest it too
 blackburn	I hope later I will have a chance to tell it :D
@sonney2k	it needs a couple of dependencies though
@sonney2k	pcre or so
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko is now soo deep into migrations that I can hardly follow
@sonney2k	I hope he manages to complete things
 blackburn	sonney2k: I did go too deep too..
@sonney2k	at least he writes many examples to test all facets
@sonney2k	blackburn, deep into what?
 blackburn	same thing I will spent my life with
 blackburn	now I got idea how to speedup diffusion maps with order of N
 blackburn	I need to stop someday..
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean with your dimension reduction toolbox
 blackburn	and I started to write this tutorial, it is 30 pages long already
 blackburn	yes, that's the only lovely thing hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw you did add sth with year 2011 as copyright etc recently
@sonney2k	I guess you should change it to 2012 now :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh yes
@sonney2k	happy new year btw :)
 blackburn	happy new year to you too heh
 blackburn	works..
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is a matrix K and I need its largest right singular vectors
 blackburn	SVD comes too slow on 1.5K
 blackburn	>10 mins
 blackburn	then I get a way to use arpack
 blackburn	with computing eigenvectors of K K^T without forming K K^T
 blackburn	cause arpack uses only Ax=b
 blackburn	and K K^T x = K y = b ..
 blackburn	smart? :D
@sonney2k	how do you avoid the K K^T ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah I forgot ,  K is a square matrix
 blackburn	sonney2k: arpack requires only dot product
 blackburn	it gives vector to product with matrix
 blackburn	and expects result
 blackburn	so K^T K v = K^T (K v) = K^T w
 blackburn	two dgemvs
 blackburn	no svd and dgemm
@sonney2k	I see :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: it really impacts with N speedup.. nice
 blackburn	O(N^2) now
 blackburn	or ~
