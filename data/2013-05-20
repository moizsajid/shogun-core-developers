@sonney2k	hushell, I am just going through some warnings - could you please document /home/buildslave/deb3_-_modular_interfaces/build/src/shogun/multiclass/MulticlassStrategy.h:148: warning: argument 'sig_params' of command @param is not found in the argument list of shogun::CMulticlassStrategy::rescale_outputs(SGVector< float64_t > outputs, const SGVector< float64_t > As, const SGVector< float64_t > Bs)?
@sonney2k	FYI warnings are here for the current build http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1146/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%2820%29

 foulwall_	damn, finally got shogun compiled... I resized the swap to 8GB...
@lisitsyn	foulwall_: haha sorry that's due to heavy templating I guess
 foulwall_	lisitsyn: haha, I'm wondering why the same thing works well on gentoo.
@lisitsyn	foulwall_: what's the compiler on gentoo?
@lisitsyn	4.7 I guess?
 foulwall_	lisitsyn: I forgot.
@lisitsyn	foulwall_: I expect gentoo is newer so better compiler
 foulwall_	lisitsyn: I haven't updated gentoo for about a year... I got tired of fixing the dependency... There must have some tricky thing in it....
@lisitsyn	ahh I see
@lisitsyn	no idea then
@lisitsyn	:)
 foulwall_	lisitsyn: anyway I can begin my data integration work. I'll ask sonney2k first...

 vgorbati	Is there anybody who can answer the questions about CKernel class?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: in this file https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/kernel/LinearARDKernel.cpp in 'compute' method there are no 'free_feature_vector' calls, won't this lead to memory leaks, will it?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: IIRC free_feature_vector for DenseFeatures is just NOP
@lisitsyn	does nothing at all
@lisitsyn	but actually it should be there
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so, 'get_feature_vector' for DenseFeatures just returns pointer to the corresponding column, without allocating extra memory?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: as I see, there is some code in free_feature_vector
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I got it, the overloaded version of get_feature_vector is called there - the one that returns SGVector, and SGVector should release the memory if needed
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: btw, why don't other kernels that work in a similar manner use this overloaded function, that handles memory problems?
-!- foulwall [~foulwall@li379-21.members.linode.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: which function?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: it's kind of legacy actually
@lisitsyn	it was uglier before
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so, which version should be used: the one that returns SGVector, or the one that returns pointer to column?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: SGVector is ok
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok. I have noticed, that some kernels follow a similar pattern: they get idx_a and idx_b vectors and then they compute the kernel value using this vectors. What if I add an intermediate class (inherited from CDotFeatures), that overrides 'compute' method:
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: it will get this vectors, and then call some inner routine
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: and this routine will be overriden in classes, inherited from this intermediate class
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: sounds good
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: the only question is how to name this intermediate class:)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: CDenseDotKernel maybe
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, will use that. Then I'll try this out, if you don't mind?
@lisitsyn	I don't mind at all :)

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: still there?

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: some string kernels follow the same pattern as well - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/kernel/string/PolyMatchStringKernel.cpp#L63 ... Should I also try to subclass them from the intermediate class?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: if this reduces LoC - yes
