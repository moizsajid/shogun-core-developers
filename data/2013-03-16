@sonney2k	blackburn, we still have crashes. as soon as make prepare-release works we can go further
@sonney2k	blackburn, feel free to run that your own and fix the crashers
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't have time today to work on it so any progress helps
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay
 wiking	check this plz and if u agree then let's merge it: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/941

 n4nd0	hey blackburn
 n4nd0	where can I find the pictures that compose https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/pics.png?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 blackburn	oh let me find it
 blackburn	wiking: so -a is more widespread than --append?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	only linux has --apend
 wiking	*--append
 blackburn	wiking: let it merge then

 shogun-buildbot_	build #807 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/807
 blackburn	n4nd0: I will prepare road signs HOG features
 blackburn	n4nd0: but we'd need your machine to handle that :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure, no problem
 n4nd0	blackburn: is it to put more tests in tapkee?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, it is rather example
 blackburn	n4nd0: yikes, the data is 1.4 gb
 n4nd0	blackburn: wow how many feature vectors and dimension?
 blackburn	n4nd0: 39209 of 3200d
 n4nd0	wow
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd reduce it to somewhat 400d I think
 blackburn	or it gets pretty hard to embed in reasonable time

 heiko	blackburn:  hi
 blackburn	heiko: hey
 heiko	just reading MulticlassSVM header file
 heiko	we really should not remove warnings if documentation is missing by putting /** @brief MulticlassSVM */
 heiko	same for the methods :)
 blackburn	heiko: heh right
 heiko	thats way too lazy :D
 blackburn	heiko: I forgot about that bug report
 heiko	blackburn: no bug here
 blackburn	running prepare-release now
 blackburn	heiko: what is wrong?
 heiko	the guy just wrote bad code
 blackburn	ahh
 heiko	uninitialised memory etc
 heiko	everything works
 heiko	Ill send him a nice example back
 heiko	and add to libshogun
 blackburn	well we are who to blame for that people can write bad code :)
 heiko	blackburn: you are totally right
 heiko	but he did not even init his label memory
 heiko	so there is no way we can avoid that in c++
 blackburn	heiko: I am not sure about that - may be there is a way

 blackburn	heiko: dst.template triangularView<Upper>() = src.template triangularView<Upper>();
 blackburn	heiko: ^ that's valid C++
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sometimes I wanna cry
 heiko	blackburn: ? :)
 heiko	what happens if you do it
 blackburn	heiko: dst.template[Space here]<Upper>()
 blackburn	heiko: crazy C++
 heiko	blackburn: am I allowed to commit stuff?
 blackburn	heiko: yes, for a year already :D
 heiko	blackburn:  you are a scherzkeks
 heiko	I mean does it interfer with your release work?
 blackburn	heiko: ah no, I just test if it works
 heiko	ok
 heiko	blackburn:  just ran into another multiclass svm bug :(
 blackburn	heiko: scherzkeks is kind of 'joker'?
 heiko	blackburn:  yes :)
 blackburn	heiko: what is da bug?
 heiko	blackburn: I will add the example
 heiko	then it will fail
 heiko	and you are forced to solve it :D
 heiko	REQUIRE(set_svm(idx, svm),"SVM set failed")
 heiko	multiclasslibsvm
 heiko	line 194 fails
 heiko	depending on inpu data
 heiko	another really nice bug
 blackburn	heiko: ahh there was some issue with that
 heiko	blackburn:
 heiko	it only occurs with multiple classes
 heiko	Ill add example
 heiko	and you have to increase number of classes from two to 3 or something to see what fails
 blackburn	heiko: btw would be nice to finally release asap or it gets forever
 heiko	blackburn:  agreed
 heiko	this bug would be nice to fix
 heiko	(also mention it in NEWS)
 blackburn	heiko: ok
 heiko	and the guy from the mailing list would be happy

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: new example for model selection multiclass svm
 heiko	blackburn: set number of dimensions/classes to 3 and you see the problem. If it works, could you permantenly increase it?
 heiko	blackburn: I gotta go now, will write to the mailing list and see you tomoroow
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	heiko: I'll check
 heiko	blackburn: thanks!
 heiko	blackburn: and a set_autolock method for multiclass would be great
 heiko	or even a lock method :)
 heiko	but thats for later
 heiko	the set_atuolock would prevent the warning that is outputted in the ex.
 heiko	blackburn:  ok gotta run now. bye!

@sonney2k	blackburn, any progress towards release?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I'll fix a bug pretty soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not sure what you meant by crashes
 blackburn	I ran prepare-release (takes \infty) and there were no real crashes
@sonney2k	blackburn, really?
@sonney2k	it crashed here
 blackburn	sonney2k: what exactly?
@sonney2k	classifier_perceptron in octave static
@sonney2k	features_dot_wdfeatures.m
@sonney2k	classifier_svmocas_objective.m
 blackburn	sonney2k: I tried octave_static examples - all ran
 blackburn	there are a lot of integration test errors, but we can't fix it yet
@sonney2k	yeah sure not a blocker
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw make prepare-release takes so long b'coz it compiles shogun for all $LANGs
@sonney2k	so now you know why I would love to have lower compile times
 blackburn	sonney2k: we'd have to speedup swig for that
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	[0.993604,1.002475] with alpha=0.050000, mean=0.998039
 blackburn	sonney2k: minor bug in xval :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: conf interval is not cut by maximum possible value
 blackburn	and we tell users accuracy is in between 0.99 and 1.002 hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, not swig is the problem...
 blackburn	sonney2k: compilation of classes is pretty fast
@sonney2k	libshogun is fast
 blackburn	sonney2k: at least getting faster with new versions of compilers
@sonney2k	but we would need split up version of the swig wrapper
@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh octave seems to work now - the environment variable needs to be OCTAVE_PATH no longer OCTAVE_LOADPATH
@sonney2k	*sigh*
 blackburn	heh

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fixed bug with libsvm 3 classes
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	sonney2k: yikes, these two commits were produced by prepare-release
 blackburn	I am not sure what changelog is used for though
 blackburn	except gpl stuff
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah I know
@sonney2k	next time git reset --hard
 blackburn	sonney2k: git reset HEAD~1 is enough
@sonney2k	blackburn, but that is a soft reset then right? and you still have this change lying around
 blackburn	sonney2k: they are erased but next commits I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: argh we failed to release on my bday :D
 blackburn	56 seconds ago
@sonney2k	blackburn, when was it?
 blackburn	sonney2k: today for you, yesterday for me
@sonney2k	blackburn, then congrats. now you are approaching the thirties quickly :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: 8 more years to approach it
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you can still become professor before that :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: phd in doing useless things :D
@sonney2k	argh I need a faster machine
@sonney2k	blackburn, for example machine learning ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah pretty useless stuff mostly
@sonney2k	blackburn, so go to guu and cure cancer!
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	guu sounds funny
@sonney2k	blackburn, our json serialization is broken :/
@sonney2k	serialization_complex_example.lua died

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: release fixes
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - disable json serialization for now
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - rename OCTAVE_LOADPATH -> OCTAVE_PATH
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm
 blackburn	sonney2k: any reason?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean it worked before right?
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	quite strange then
 blackburn	I do not remember any chagnes

 blackburn	sonney2k: actually I never tried them (shame on me)
@sonney2k	blackburn, they work as good as SVMs
 blackburn	sonney2k: I beat them on GTSRB
@sonney2k	I used them to predict whether a molecule is a drug or not back in the days :D
@sonney2k	GTRSRB?
 blackburn	sonney2k: german traffic sign recognition benchmark
@sonney2k	ahh
 blackburn	sonney2k: funny thing happened with GTSDB (detection instead of recognition)
 blackburn	sonney2k: they all got 1.0 ROCs
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah they cannot provide realvalued outputs
@sonney2k	it is a majority vote
@sonney2k	100 trees...
@sonney2k	btw, bagged KNN
@sonney2k	works also very very well
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=results
@sonney2k	no idea if that also has a standard name
 blackburn	sonney2k: never heard about special name for that
 blackburn	sonney2k: bagging is effective thing for anything I guess
 blackburn	efficient
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, are you in this table?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I wish I was
@sonney2k	some ELL_SVM2 won?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I started my research on recognition after GTSRB and I just had no time to do GTSDB
 blackburn	sonney2k: not sure what ELL means
 blackburn	sonney2k: second place is integral channel features with multiple scaling I guess
 blackburn	according to its name
@sonney2k	blackburn, alright I am off to bed.
 blackburn	sonney2k: good night
@sonney2k	blackburn, get drunk and celebrate!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to finish paper stuff
@sonney2k	I hope we get prepare release to work
@sonney2k	blackburn, then get drunk and finish paper stuff :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: 1.5 years of accident writing jmlr paper is crazy
@sonney2k	blackburn, well you could have had the paper about 1 year ago but you took the long route
* sonney2k Zzzzz
 blackburn	sonney2k: good thing is that it is fast now
 blackburn	and being used for real
 blackburn	by chemists though :D
 blackburn	I expected ML/data analysis hah
