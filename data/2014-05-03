 thoralf	Sorry.

 thoralf	Yeah, now I know.
 thoralf	"My" pickle doesn't talk about India. ;)
 kislay	haha

 kislay	hey, come to think of it...abinash panda is my senior who lives downfloor of the same hostel I am currently residing in!
 kislay	thoralf, you must not be knowing this..right?
 lisitsyn	really?

 thoralf	Cool.
 kislay	oh! so it happened earlier..

 kislay	lisitsyn, so you must have hacked together...
 lisitsyn	some kind of
 kislay	lisitsyn, male-bonding...Yeah..i know this stuff!
 thoralf	male-bonding?
 thoralf	Man, dirty talking in the public?
 kislay	thoralf, what?
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	I guess it wasn't dirty thing by its meaning :D
 kislay	lisitsyn, you understood me correct!!
 thoralf	Ah, you're playing the misunderstanding card! :D
 thoralf	Well done.
 thoralf	Your point.
 kislay	thoralf, you wanna continue?
 thoralf	kislay: No.  It's boring this way.
 kislay	thoralf, okay.
 kislay	thoralf, hey, My project need integration of openCV with shogun. So pickle told me to understand how other optional packages like eigen3 and all are working right now!
 kislay	thoralf, so..any pointers on this thing that you may suggest!
 thoralf	I don't know opencv
 thoralf	Never used it.
 kislay	thoralf, np! thanks anyway!

@wiking	HeikoS: ping here?
@HeikoS	wiking: hi!
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	long time no see, how are things?
@wiking	HeikoS: busy
@wiking	HeikoS: so basically i've been checking out travis caching capability
@HeikoS	and?
@wiking	in order to speed up build times
@HeikoS	wiking: so thats just to prevent re-doing things all the time
@HeikoS	wiking: what exactly is cached? and when are things re-used?
@wiking	well basically we could cache all the bundle libraries
@wiking	like nlopt, eigen and json
@wiking	since currently we always download + compile all those libraries
@HeikoS	in every build right?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	is it then shared across build of ONE pr?
@HeikoS	or even across many PR?
@wiking	well should be shared across all jobs
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	we shoulnd't recompile those ever
@HeikoS	yeah that would be amazing, then we can put in more stuff :)
@HeikoS	unless a new version is around?
@HeikoS	or system changes?
@wiking	just when we bump one library's version
@wiking	travis has caching capability
@wiking	but currently only supports directory caching
@wiking	so we should precompile somewhere the bundled libraries using the same env as travis jobs
@wiking	and then cache those directories
@wiking	with travis
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	sounds good
@HeikoS	wiking: though sonds like tricky hacking :)
@wiking	i mean the thing is that travis has straight caching capability based on amazon s3
@wiking	btw: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/how-to-skip-a-build/
@wiking	this should be used by everybody
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, thats good, feel free to do that. I tend to be not so good in those things :)
@wiking	i.e. if there's only documentation update in the commit
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah totally
@HeikoS	wiking: btw did you have a thought about the notebook views from travis?
@wiking	HeikoS: well we could even make travis to build the notebooks of course
@HeikoS	wiking: oh, another things that I thought would be nice is if it would produce the documentation html and put a link somehwere, so that I can proofread latex doc updates
@wiking	HeikoS: but for that we need amazon s3
@HeikoS	wiking: the buildbot also can do this, so no need for now I guess
@HeikoS	wiking: btw how are things apart from that?
@wiking	HeikoS: well we currently regenerate doxygen docs nightly
@wiking	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/
@wiking	is always the latest doxygen build
@HeikoS	wiking: but thats nightly
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean in order to review the changes
@HeikoS	wiking: since people do tend to not read the docs properly before merging
@wiking	HeikoS: mmm that's too tricky
@HeikoS	would be good if that was produced, doesnt take very long actually
@HeikoS	wiking: really?, ok, just thought I would like to have it, not how hard it is :)
@wiking	i'm gonna first try to experiment with caching the libraries
