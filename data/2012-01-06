 blackburn	sonne|work: around?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sonne|work any of you? ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, wassup?
 blackburn	sonney2k: check dis out http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/edrt-tutorial.pdf
 blackburn	should be distributed alongside with my paper :)
 blackburn	just after I finish it..
@sonney2k	wow
@sonney2k	lot of effort
 blackburn	I told you I want to write a 'book', I guess I started it accidentally
@sonney2k	go ahead and do that for the rest of shogun ;-)
 blackburn	sure, I like this kind of work
 blackburn	well I love latex
 blackburn	too much I guess
 blackburn	sonney2k: where do you think I should include this doc?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well we could create shogun/tutorial
 blackburn	hmm yes sure
@sonney2k	and then below that have shogun/tutorial/dimensionreduction
 blackburn	I'm worried what to include along with paper
 blackburn	the whole shogun?..
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	I don't understand
 blackburn	sonney2k: jmlr mloss track?
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	I need to include software
 blackburn	my paper..
 blackburn	about dim reduction stuff
@sonney2k	what is the problem?
 blackburn	what should I include?
 blackburn	whole shogun?
@sonney2k	I would say yes
 blackburn	that's pretty strange that's why I'm worried with it
@sonney2k	what are the alternatives?
@sonney2k	create a big patch file and say - please apply to shogun 1.1.0 ?
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	no alternatives
 blackburn	sonney2k: can we release 1.1.1 when I finish including this paper stuff?
@sonney2k	I would like to have heikos migrations in the next release
 blackburn	i think it will take 1-2 weeks more
 blackburn	what is heiko's plan?
@sonney2k	btw, I wanted to propose a different way of getting code / patches merged
@sonney2k	like you / me also only submitting pull requests
@sonney2k	and me/you reviewing them
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	gtg
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah you told it before.. but I still think it will only take our time
@sonney2k	it will improve quality - we both make mistakes the other one can spot easily
@sonney2k	so it would help - however we should have some hard deadlines until when a patch has to be reviews
@sonney2k	e.g. <24hrs
@sonney2k	otherwise one is free to merge
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^]
@sonney2k	^
 blackburn	hmm we should try..
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please take a look on paper 4/5 of my paper? are graphs ok?
 blackburn	page*
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	paper of paper
 blackburn	ahaha
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes figures look great
 blackburn	sonney2k: should I enlarge text?
 blackburn	oh it already takes too much
@sonney2k	maybe a bit - but not essential for initial version
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok thanks
@sonney2k	it is good that you renamed it to efficient dim red toolbox
@sonney2k	large scale would make many people upset
@sonney2k	I know it is fast but it requires the distance matrix to be in memory for most algos
@sonney2k	that is a problem
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	well I renamed it because of you told it
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please glance over abstract, I reworked it just now?
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw I mentioned you in acks ;)

 puneetgoyal	blackburn: hi
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: hi
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: I am having words such as '98', 'ss' and some more such words or decimals with high tf-idf values
 puneetgoyal	and I think that is where the problem is
 blackburn	yes, it could be a problem
 blackburn	but strange '98' has high tf-idf
 puneetgoyal	yes, I have checked the alog a lot of times
 puneetgoyal	actually there are some data files for which charset is some different type
 puneetgoyal	like CHINESEBIG5
 puneetgoyal	and from there such words are coming mainly
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: well don't care about it now, just try to classify docs
