@iglesiasg	gsomix, hi!
 gsomix	iglesiasg, hey
@iglesiasg	gsomix, how are you doing?
 gsomix	iglesiasg, it seems fine, but I'm not sure. :) what about you?
@iglesiasg	gsomix, I am good :) Ready to make some progress hehe
@iglesiasg	gsomix,  I just run the unit tests in my machine and got this:
@iglesiasg	[  FAILED  ] SGObject.clone_equals_AsciiFile
@iglesiasg	[  FAILED  ] SerializationAscii.AsciiFile
@iglesiasg	[  FAILED  ] SerializationHDF5.AsciiFile
@iglesiasg	[  FAILED  ] SerializationXML.AsciiFile
@iglesiasg	gsomix, do you happen to have any idea if there was a problem with these tests?
@iglesiasg	I am checking travis atm
@iglesiasg	but the webpage is taking ages to looooad :D
 gsomix	iglesiasg, hm
 gsomix	failed because of AsciiFile doesn't exist in this universe anymore
 gsomix	need to check
@iglesiasg	gsomix, hehe ok
@iglesiasg	gsomix, maybe I should make clean and recompile from zero

@iglesiasg	gsomix, btw
@iglesiasg	is there any trick to use the CSVFile class or similar to read from a gz compressed file?
@iglesiasg	gsomix, I have a CSV file gz compressed from which I would like to load a feature matrix
 wiking	iglesiasg: zcat
@iglesiasg	wiking, thanks!
@iglesiasg	wiking, I need to use from a example in the python modular interface
 wiking	iglesiasg: use zlib in python
@iglesiasg	wiking, what about gzip.GzipFile()
@iglesiasg	that returns me a string if read() is called after that
@iglesiasg	then I need to parse that string to a numpy.array to get the feature matrix
@iglesiasg	just wondering if there was something easy as we have RealFeatures(CSVFile('fname')) to get features from a CSVFile gz-compressed
@iglesiasg	sonney2k told me to compress the file, so I assumed it should be straightforward to load features from the gz file too
 wiking	iglesiasg: afaik CSVFile should support FILE*
 gsomix	iglesiasg, nope.  as I know we don't support gzipped files in CSVFile.
 wiking	and it does
 wiking	imho
 wiking	so if it does
 wiking	then basically if u can supply an object that has .read() function for CSVFile
 wiking	then it would be ok
 wiking	iglesiasg: cant u just do
@iglesiasg	wiking, I tried with CSVFile(gzip.GzipFile('gzipped file'))
 wiking	RealFeatures(CSVFile(gzip.GzipFile('fulename'))) ?
 wiking	and?
@iglesiasg	it broke
@iglesiasg	let me try again, in case I screwed something
 wiking	what did it say?
 wiking	CSVFile(gzip.open('file.txt.gz', 'rb'))
 wiking	?
@iglesiasg	wiking, the constructor of CSVFile does not work
@iglesiasg	ah wait
@iglesiasg	I didn't do it with gzip.open
@iglesiasg	let me try with that
 wiking	its the same i think
 wiking	what do u mean does not work?
@iglesiasg	wiking, same same
@iglesiasg	wiking,  ** NotImplementedError: Wrong number or type of arguments for overloaded function 'new_CSVFile'.
 wiking	mmm
