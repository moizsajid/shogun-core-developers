@rock_curve	who is natasha romanova
@rock_curve	ohh
@rock_curve	haha
@rock_curve	natalia alianovna haha
@rock_curve	what a middle name
@afaikidk	rock_curve: who is natalia?
@afaikidk	portman?
@afaikidk	:/
@rock_curve	natasha = natalia
@afaikidk	portwoman
@rock_curve	:D
@afaikidk	oh is it
@rock_curve	I can't tell portman from knightley anyway
@afaikidk	rock_curve: join the team
@rock_curve	wat team?
@afaikidk	rock_curve: loved the "for female" part though :D
@afaikidk	people who can't tell portamn from knightley
@rock_curve	afaikidk: haha
@rock_curve	afaikidk: I was disappointed by knightley in this imitation game movie
@afaikidk	rock_curve: haven't watched it yet
@rock_curve	imho cumberbatch rocks but not knightley
@afaikidk	yeah that he does! :D I liked knightley in those pirates of Caribbean movies
@rock_curve	afaikidk: this movie like tells you
@rock_curve	all these computers were created by GAAAY
@rock_curve	live with that!

@afaikidk	rock_curve: you mean, pidorah :D
@rock_curve	haha
@afaikidk	I remember this term
@rock_curve	in such a homophobic country like mine it is funny
@rock_curve	they are like woaah he is gay no way
@afaikidk	pretty much same picture here as well
@afaikidk	apart from mumbai fashion people
@afaikidk	they are all gay
@afaikidk	rock_curve: btw who does keira knightley portray then? if turing was gay... :/
@rock_curve	afaikidk: his wife!
@afaikidk	wait.. what? he had one?
@rock_curve	yeah real story
@afaikidk	no wonder you didn't like her in the film :D
@rock_curve	iirc in real life they were talking etc
@afaikidk	rock_curve: btw are you floating the REST api project for gsoc?
@rock_curve	I guess it was better for them to get married :D
@afaikidk	hahaha
@afaikidk	such a painful life
@rock_curve	afaikidk: ohh should post it
@afaikidk	talking about marriage freaks me out now - I went home last week and all my family was talking was 'when are you getting married' :|
@afaikidk	rock_curve: btw what I wanted to discuss is - say, we write our own parallel computation engine using openmp..
@afaikidk	rock_curve: we need a job scheduler
@rock_curve	afaikidk: hah just like my gf
@rock_curve	afaikidk: hmm job scheduler
@afaikidk	rock_curve: oh and also - since computation engine is internal to shogun - I suggest we get rid of inheritance and use policy
@rock_curve	that's like big
@rock_curve	afaikidk: inheritance could be better sometimes if you want remote execution
@afaikidk	rock_curve: yeah my gf too! she gave me 7 gifts on 14th and all I gave her was a poor stuffed puppy - still she wants to marry me
@afaikidk	rock_curve: what do you mean?
@rock_curve	if everything is static you can't just obj->dosomething()
@rock_curve	and dosomething is like remote procedure call
@rock_curve	which calls other object on other machine
@afaikidk	rock_curve: why would we need obj->dosomething()
@rock_curve	just an example
@rock_curve	I should take a look at this thing
@afaikidk	rock_curve: you know any readymade alternative ?
@rock_curve	nope

@afaikidk	rock_curve: basically I want that serial, parallel and cluster engines should work from the same interfave
@afaikidk	so it kinds depends on how viktor is planning to get mesos into shogun
@rock_curve	yes mesos is the way to go
@afaikidk	rock_curve:
@afaikidk	yes
@rock_curve	well writing a scheduler on top of zookeeper is really easy
@afaikidk	rock_curve: we'll have to think a bit about this - but I believe that we won't need virtual things for engine - that
@afaikidk	is shogun's internal
@afaikidk	we just expose jobs
@afaikidk	umm maybe director class
@rock_curve	afaikidk: why?
@afaikidk	so that even from python someone can define a job
@afaikidk	that may not be there in shogun
@afaikidk	similar kinds of plans we had for linear operator

@rock_curve	afaikidk: is it really needed? :)
@afaikidk	rock_curve: doesn't hurt :D
@rock_curve	afaikidk: I think such out of box scheduling can be done by some other framework :)
@besser82	rock_curve, afaikidk:  ZeroMQ?  ;)
@rock_curve	besser82: hmm well on top of zmq may be

 Tendulkar	hello guys
 Tendulkar	I need help with installing Python Shogun Modular
 Tendulkar	when I do cmake -DPythonModular=ON in build dir
 Tendulkar	I get an error
 nirantk	What is the error?
 Tendulkar	Could not find CCACHE & SWIG
 Tendulkar	Any idea how to fix this?
 nirantk	I will try to reproduce the bug and see
 Tendulkar	I did
 Tendulkar	mkdir build
 Tendulkar	cd build
 Tendulkar	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 Tendulkar	then
 Tendulkar	cmake -DPythonModular=ON ..
 Tendulkar	cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 Tendulkar	After that I keep getting that error on whichever cmake command I use
@rock_curve	install swig
 Tendulkar	ok let me try
@wiking	damn
@wiking	what do i need to do?
@besser82	wiking, for what?  :P
@wiking	diunno
@wiking	i've got cazillions of emails
@wiking	that i shoudl do for shogun :D
 Tendulkar	rock_curve: thanks, that works
 Tendulkar	but when I do import modshogun, it doesn't work
@wiking	arg
@wiking	who's who in this  nick mayham :)
@rock_curve	wiking: what
 Tendulkar	I get this warning CMake Warning:   Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:      pythonModular
 Tendulkar	when I do cmake -DpythonModular=ON
@rock_curve	Tendulkar: Python
@rock_curve	not python
 Tendulkar	rock_curve: that was a typo
@rock_curve	Tendulkar: yes, fix that and it will recognize this optiona
@rock_curve	wiking: want to do rest with me?
 Tendulkar	I mean, I wrote correctly in the terminal..
 Tendulkar	It generates modshogun.py
 Tendulkar	in shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
 Tendulkar	I added that path to pythonpath
@rock_curve	ok
 Tendulkar	but not working.. import modshogun gives an error
 Tendulkar	libshogun.so no such file
@rock_curve	then you need LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 Tendulkar	Thanks a lot rock_curve

 AndreLopes	Where do i find the documentation of the methods of shogun?
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@122.162.211.216] has joined #shogun
@wiking	rest rest rest
@wiking	i'm gonna be going to sleep now
@wiking	as i'm suppert tired
@wiking	gnite
@wiking	AndreLopes: http://shogun.ml/doc/en/latest/
 AndreLopes	i mean the methods documentation
@wiking	well that's what it is
 AndreLopes	is there anything close to javadoc?
 AndreLopes	For example...
 AndreLopes	idk what this method does
 AndreLopes	DoubleMatrix out_labels = to_binary(perceptron.apply()).get_labels();
@wiking	gets all the labels for your features after classifying them
@wiking	and puts them in a matrix
@wiking	or in this case into a vector :P
 AndreLopes	Ah.
 AndreLopes	Thanks, but is there a C++ doc?
 AndreLopes	anything so i can find out what x method does?
@wiking	have u checked the link i've just copy pasted
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/doc/en/latest/
 AndreLopes	yes i did
 AndreLopes	but i cant find what im looking for
 AndreLopes	i find the examples, some tutorials but not a method doc
@wiking	http://shogun.ml/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CLibSVM.html
@wiking	use the search box
 AndreLopes	I love you lol
@wiking	it'll give u the results for each class
@wiking	and then you can read the docs
 AndreLopes	yes!
@wiking	but of course you can just have this locally
@wiking	by
@wiking	having doxygen + make doc
 AndreLopes	hmm
@wiking	it'll generate the whole thing localhost
 AndreLopes	I dont think its possible to generate a javadoc yet right?
@wiking	rock_curve: have u managed to create a docset?
@wiking	AndreLopes: noup not yet
@wiking	:<
 AndreLopes	What if i java doc by copying each method lol
 AndreLopes	would that help others too ?
@wiking	well that's very manual work
@rock_curve	wiking: didn't try
@wiking	this should be automated
 AndreLopes	Hmm...
@wiking	swig wanted to add the support for it
@wiking	but i think that's not yet ready
 AndreLopes	well if they dont, then i might do it manually
 AndreLopes	and send to you guys.
 AndreLopes	might take some days :D
@wiking	well maybe putting the effort to do that
@wiking	in swig
@wiking	would be more beneficial for everythingy
@wiking	*everybody
@wiking	but that's only my 2 cents
 AndreLopes	well im new here
 AndreLopes	im not sure how to mess with swig
 AndreLopes	where do i start?
@wiking	mmm swig?
 AndreLopes	yes
@wiking	try finding out where's the code that was actually performing the doxygen -> javadoc stuff
 AndreLopes	ok
 AndreLopes	googling.. found 2012 related
