 rcurtin	I want to eventually be able to refer to the benchmarks as a development tool... i.e. some automatic tool reports "commit a636dab slows down k-means by 50%" and opens a github issue or makes some other notification
@HeikoS	oh that would be so good
@HeikoS	yeah, we want to do something like this on the buildbot as well
 rcurtin	yeah, and you could also use it with PRs or something to automatically test the speedup or slowdown of a particular commit or set of commits
@HeikoS	rcurtin: that would be best
 rcurtin	we *kind* of have this set up now, but the setup isn't complete
@HeikoS	can one execute this partly?
 rcurtin	yeah
@HeikoS	i.e. only one benchmark?
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	ill talk to wiking
 rcurtin	so marcus has a jenkins job that will fire off and run updated code
@HeikoS	he just set up a hook from github to your buildbot
@HeikoS	to upload the cookbook in PRs
@HeikoS	can do the same with benchmark
 rcurtin	so like if I modify src/mlpack/methods/det/, then it will run only the det benchmarks
 rcurtin	and report the changes in IRC
@HeikoS	yeah really nice
 rcurtin	but I think that the datasets it uses are often too small to extract any real patterns
 rcurtin	sometimes it goes from like 0.0005s to 0.0007s but that's just OS noise
@HeikoS	yeah thats what I tell ppl as well
@HeikoS	at least a few seconds runtime is needed
 rcurtin	yeah
 rcurtin	but that's just a matter of configuring the datasets right
 rcurtin	so wiking set up a hook that calls http://big.mlpack.org:7780/job/benchmark%20-%20shogun/ ?
