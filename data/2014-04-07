 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: around?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah
 HeikoS1	slot stuff is done yeah?
 lisitsyn	yes yes
 HeikoS1	just double checking here
 HeikoS1	ok
 HeikoS1	thanks
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: you asked me to tell you when my blog is up
 HeikoS1	just going through my calendar and updating things
 lisitsyn	it is ;)
 HeikoS1	nice
 HeikoS1	link=?
 lisitsyn	http://sergey.lisitsyn.me/
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: you can check it here http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/profile/edit/google/gsoc2014/shogun
 lisitsyn	click preferences
 lisitsyn	and you will see slots ;)
@wiking	HeikoS1: boooo
 HeikoS1	wiking: ?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: nice layout!
@wiking	HeikoS1: no merge when u r have sleep ;)
 HeikoS1	haha, wiking is it the notebook?
 HeikoS1	or the demos?
@wiking	HeikoS1: notebook
 HeikoS1	wiking: the opencv one?
 HeikoS1	wiking: ah yeah, mmmh
 HeikoS1	wiking: did you happen to find any time on the preview thing? Its quite painful to review notebooks
@wiking	HeikoS1: why? i mean gist is just as good as it gets
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah the opencv one... you've just merged a jpg in the src repo ;P
@wiking	and as well a notebook that has all it's output cells filled out
 HeikoS1	wiking: argh, yeah soory about that
 HeikoS1	wiking: told the guy not to do and did not double checlk
@wiking	that's why actually you couldn't comment decently in the PR the notebook line-by-line
 HeikoS1	wiking: it would be cool to have this preview of the patch + the notebook with all outputs
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah i've written that as well seems that slipped
 HeikoS1	so that one doesnt have to check these things in code
 HeikoS1	wiking: well sorry about the merge .... you are right, half asleep ;)
 Christopher	could someone comment on my problem? :)
@wiking	HeikoS1: well it gets wrose... as we need a way to be able to keep up with the dependencies of a notebook
@wiking	HeikoS1: since now this notebook requires opencv
 HeikoS1	wiking: the opencv stuff?
@wiking	and this will just start blowing up one by one
 HeikoS1	wiking: yeah, but that would be solved if we had this preview hook thing or wouldnt it?
@wiking	no
@wiking	why?
@wiking	will that magically install opencv?
 HeikoS1	wiking: no but it will fail to produce the output if no opencv is there
@wiking	Christopher: i reckon you've ended up having a similar bug like this one: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1925
@wiking	HeikoS1: actually in this very case that wouldn't be the case ;)
@wiking	HeikoS1: as this one has it's output alredy filled in.. so you wouldn't able to tell when was that generated
 HeikoS1	wiking: thats why I mentioned this two things:
 HeikoS1	wiking: if a notebook PR is sent
 HeikoS1	wiking: buildbot produces two things:
 HeikoS1	wiking: runs the notebook produces all outputs and renders
 HeikoS1	wiking: and another one where just the notebook is rendered
 HeikoS1	so that one can see whats actually in there and how it will look
 HeikoS1	then gives two links
@wiking	HeikoS1: renders?
@wiking	what do you mean by renders?
@wiking	nbviewer renders it for you....
@wiking	i dont see any reason why we would need to run our own renderer...
 HeikoS1	wiking: whatevewr
 HeikoS1	wiking: that was not my point
 HeikoS1	but that we have two versions
 HeikoS1	one with and one without output
 HeikoS1	just to remove the need to read the NB sourcecode
 Christopher	it fails at the same point
 Christopher	the error is different though
 HeikoS1	Christopher: sorry, what is the problem ?
 HeikoS1	Christopher: ah mac
 Christopher	I', trying to build shogun with python modular on mac osx 10.7.5
 HeikoS1	Christopher: I am no help with this, sorry, never used a mac
 kislay	HeikoS1, hey
 HeikoS1	kislay: heja!
 kislay	HeikoS1, did you check that demo. Is is working fine?
 HeikoS1	kislay: not yet, but about to
 kislay	lisitsyn, hey, awesome blog man!! :D
 lisitsyn	kislay: thanks

 lisitsyn	wow
 lisitsyn	what's the issue with reverting notebook HeikoS1?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: contains output and a jpg
 HeikoS1	needs to be resent clean
 lisitsyn	hah
@wiking	Christopher: i reckon the best option is to add there your error output
@wiking	i mean to that issue
 HeikoS1	wiking: you saw the revert?
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: the revert is not useful...
 Christopher	ok, thanks!
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: it will be in git history now anyway...
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: ah, so what to do? I am sorry for the mess...
 sonne|work	too late :) just let him move the data to data now and we live with that .jpg in the history.
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: ah the pain .... ;)

 thoralf	Hey.
 vvu|Log	thoralf: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10028121
 vvu|Log	here is the thingies for my modshogun not found
 vvu|Log	the error that i got a few days ago if u remember
 thoralf	vvu|Log: Still your python problem?
 vvu|Log	yep
 vvu|Log	it seems that i do not have $LD_LIBRAY_PATH set up
 thoralf	Try start "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ python"
 thoralf	Or "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ python ./foo/yourscript.py"
 thoralf	vvu|Log: But if it's not set-up, then you should already know what the problem is... ;)
 vvu|Log	thoralf: same thingie even if i set it up, should i point it to shogun-install dir ?
 thoralf	vvu|Log: Doesn't make a difference.
 pfm_	someone shoudl implement loopy belief propagation
 pfm_	so i can use it
 thoralf	You should do two things: 1. use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to define the location of libshogun and 2. tell python where to find modshogun.
 thoralf	pfm_: Sure? ;)
 pfm_	awesome, thanks :p
 thoralf	pfm_: If you're not doing it, find someone who either does it for money or has enough spare time to do it. ;)
 thoralf	(Shouldn't be too hard to implement though.)
 pfm_	thoralf: i will look into doing it myself
 thoralf	vvu|Log: Did you check the python section of https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/doc/md/INSTALL.md ?

 kislay	thoralf, hi :)
 thoralf	kislay: Hey!  The first guy who manages to say hi before asking something. ;)
 kislay	thoralf, haha :D
 thoralf	kislay: You won a free question. :)
 kislay	thoralf, Just wanted to share what I did till now on that issue #2054
 thoralf	kislay: Cool, tell me what you got.
 kislay	thoralf, as a new user is working with his code , he suddenly realizes that he needs to train some data.
 kislay	so I have assumed/created a small( but pragmatic) liver disorder libsvm dataset
 thoralf	kislay: Cool, good example.
 kislay	thoralf, then there's the separate file which reads line by line from that data file and fill the labels and features respectively
 thoralf	kislay: Is it based on real data?  Where does the data come from?
 thoralf	kislay: Is it possible to use some of the built-in readers of shogun?
 kislay	hmmm. I got lots of them from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
 kislay	thoralf, till now I was using std::get_line!!
 thoralf	kislay: shogun has got a libsvm reader ;)
 kislay	thoralf, damn!
 thoralf	kislay: Don't tell that you spent time on writing your own.
 thoralf	I'm so sorry.
 kislay	thoralf, don't worry. :D
 kislay	thoralf, but one thing for sure.. shogun really want lot of intuition from the user side.
 thoralf	kislay: Yeah, that's why we need a tutorial.
 thoralf	Just a show explanation how to do things so his intuition gets trained...

 thoralf	Hey sonney2k
 thoralf	Hey sonne|osx
 kislay	thoralf, yup.
 thoralf	kislay: How did you learn shogun?
 kislay	thoralf, me!!, I played with notebooks a lot.
 kislay	thoralf, pytohn's always easy.
* thoralf did the painful c++ way. :D
 kislay	thoralf, :D
 kislay	thoralf, I understand that pain better now :D
 kislay	thoralf, btw thanks for that info on SGREF/SGUNREF  calls. It took some time, but I finally managed to learn some thumb rules regarding them.
 thoralf	kislay: Okay, the rules are: If someone gives you a reference, do a SG_REF at the beginning of your use and SG_UNREF as soon as you don't need the object any more.
 thoralf	kislay: If you're just creating an object to pass it into some function, then you may omit the SG_REF/UNREF, but don't use the object on your own, because it can be freed any time.
 thoralf	kislay: If you want to be sure your object stays, make an initial SG_REF and don't forget the SG_UNREF.
 thoralf	Does this match your rules of thumb?
 kislay	thoralf, I see. Mine were pretty vague as compared to yours.
 kislay	thoralf, hey man, thanks a lot for pointing all them out. :)
 thoralf	kislay: In doubt you can use either (a) valgrind to check your program for leaks/double frees or (b) print the reference counts with printf("...", object->ref_count())...
 kislay	thoralf, I mostly worked with the rule 2 of yours.( it was there in the 2nd example in the developer tuto)
 kislay	thoralf, yeah. I used the GCDEBUG mode to see those creation/destroyed messages of the SgRefObjects.
