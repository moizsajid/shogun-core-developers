 blackburn1	n4nd0: 6 leaky examples left!
 n4nd0	blackburn1: good job!
 n4nd0	which ones?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: base_*, two from GPs and so_multiclass_BMRM
 n4nd0	I thought that the commit sonney2k did some days ago solved so_multiclass_BMRM
 blackburn1	n4nd0: btw so_multiclass_BMRM now produces ~20% accuracy
 blackburn1	am I wrong it was 100%?
 n4nd0	O_O
 n4nd0	I think it was yes
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/9e92392d28364109efae45282fa2105e64d27fde
 n4nd0	I think that solved so_multiclass_BMRM
 n4nd0	but I didn't check it
 blackburn1	it leaks on apply
 blackburn1	and ~20%
 blackburn1	11 sometimes
 n4nd0	mmm that's weird
 n4nd0	we should mail michal and ask him
 n4nd0	I would say it was more than 20%, 100% actually
 n4nd0	I am not sure though
 blackburn1	n4nd0: I think it is related to features loading
 n4nd0	aham, int read_data?
 n4nd0	has something been changed there?
 blackburn1	yeah in commit you pointed to
 blackburn1	it appears to be rando
 blackburn1	n4nd0: no it is all ok with features
 blackburn1	I've inserted liblinear there
 blackburn1	~92
 blackburn1	n4nd0: do you have time to track what caused the problem?
 n4nd0	in so_multiclass_BMRM?
 n4nd0	blackburn1: ^
 blackburn1	???
 blackburn1	yes
 n4nd0	sure, I can do that later today
 blackburn1	okay thanks
 n4nd0	I am with another thing right now, but will look into it later
 blackburn1	I'm now going to get some food in :D and then will fix regression examples
@sonney2k	n4nd0, any chance bern4rd has time this evening?
 n4nd0	no idea...
 n4nd0	I can give you his mail if you want so you can tell him
@sonney2k	n4nd0, kthx
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn1: around?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	there is something weird with my data repo I don't get
 n4nd0	if I am in shogun/data
 n4nd0	git st
 n4nd0	# On branch master
 n4nd0	nothing to commit (working directory clean)
 n4nd0	but when I am in shogun/
 n4nd0	git st
 n4nd0	# On branch master
 n4nd0	# Changes not staged for commit:
 n4nd0	#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
 n4nd0	#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
 n4nd0	#
 n4nd0	#modified:   data (new commits)
 n4nd0	#
 n4nd0	??
 blackburn1	what if you go to data and git pull origin master?
 n4nd0	I think that then git st in shogun/data says that there are new commits
 n4nd0	nah, it says the same
 n4nd0	everything the same after that
 n4nd0	git data I just have one remote called origin that points to shogun-toolbox/shogun-data-git
 n4nd0	.git at the end ^
 n4nd0	lunch time, see you later

@sonney2k	n4nd0, you need to do git submodule update

 blackburn999	3 examples
@sonney2k	bern4rd, alright - no idea if you come back but let me explain a few issues I need help with: the 'download now' knob needs to link to the latest http:// src code download url or the latest news like http://shogun.7nn.de/new/8
@sonney2k	bern4rd, the rss feed at the bottom should do the feed for news
@sonney2k	bern4rd, I have no idea how to modify the sqlite database to use 'sort_order' columns instead of 'order' ( I got conflicts when attempting to convert the sqlite database)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please run python multiclass_qda.py
@sonney2k	(it crashes here...)
 bern4rd	I'm here,
@sonney2k	bern4rd, hey
@sonney2k	bern4rd, biggest issue to me is really that I don't know how to rename the 'order' fields to 'sort_oder' in the sqlite db
 bern4rd	The rss is not done, but if you want I think I can do it
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ok lets do it later (I did this a couple of times so not highest prio)
 bern4rd	about order, I have seen you changed the name in models.py
 bern4rd	but is necessary to update the db
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0,  please run python multiclass_qda.py
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> (it crashes here...)
 n4nd0	:O
@sonney2k	blackburn999, does python regression_gaussian_process_demo.py
@sonney2k	Traceback (most recent call last):
@sonney2k	 work for you?

@sonney2k	bern4rd, I had to - I didn't manage to convert the sqlite db to mysql w/o that
@sonney2k	bern4rd, the django way with loaddata (fixtures) didn't work
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it crashes here too ... I am on it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, does python regression_lars.py also crash?
@sonney2k	blackburn ^ ?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, all the way
 bern4rd	so are you using sqlite3?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: any clue what change may have caused it?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, on shogun.7nn.de ?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	mysql
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no idea
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw python so_multiclass_BMRM.py works and gives 100% accuracy - any ideas what is different to the C++ example?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I guess that the data is not the same basically
 n4nd0	in any case, so_multiclass_BMRM in C++ prints out the error not the accuracy
 n4nd0	I don't know if you noticed about that
 n4nd0	IIRC so_multiclass_BMRM was really toy data
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we need to unify examples.. otherwise it is getting messy: e.g. all MC examples should use the same MC data set
 n4nd0	ok

@sonney2k	<sonney2k> bern4rd, on shogun.7nn.de ?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ^ did you see this?
 bern4rd	I am reading about
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I don't understand that, sorry
@sonney2k	n4nd0, basically currently graphical examples are not run on make check-examples
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but we could have another target 'create-figures' that would run the graphical examples and each example generates a .png on disc
@sonney2k	so we can directly put these online (website...)
 bern4rd	you changed from order to sort_order, but is not working. I guess that is because the database is not updated so the sqlite code has "order". I am trying to update the sqlite code.
 n4nd0	aham, I see now
 n4nd0	yes, that's a good idea to implement
@sonney2k	everything we have to do manually is bug prone...
@sonney2k	blackburn - more bugs: run in ocr application ./predict
@sonney2k	blackburn ohh it seems all applications are b0rken

 n4nd0	sonney2k: qda_multiclass breaks in ~SGVector
@sonney2k	blackburn, but before fix python regression_lars.py also crash :)
 bern4rd	The problem is that syncdb only update new tables, but not changes in existing tables. I have read about South and Django Evolution that is a tool to edit django database easily. I have installed an i am learning about it
 blackburn	sonney2k: arts is working
 blackburn	sonney2k: 2-3 weeks before marina was asking me how to use arts
 blackburn	it seems I helped more or less
@sonney2k	bern4rd, that is too much I think - all we need to do is alter the tables and rename the columns from 'order' to 'sort_order'
 blackburn	however I still do not know what does it do
@sonney2k	blackburn, it predicts the start of genes on your dna :D
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@122.174.81.98] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 bern4rd	ah ok, for that with the sql command line should be enough
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I said it predicts something she could be interested about
@sonney2k	bern4rd, exactly
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not interested in things that do not lead to obtain some vodka
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh you could find the gene to tweak that allows you to get high w/o vodka :D
 blackburn	I am in
 blackburn	please guide me where to start
@sonney2k	blackburn, release first - drugs later :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: are base_* leaks blocking you?
 blackburn	I am unsure it is a correct test now, may be we can live with it
@sonney2k	blackburn, errors in applications, graphical examples, base leaks, website...
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how are the screenshots done?
@sonney2k	I mean the where you have /bigpicture/ links?
 bern4rd	in views.py i have the method showPicture, this method loads the template bigpicture.html and give the name of the picture selected
 bern4rd	I got the pictures from the other shogun web-page
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ahh so it is taking the picture from static/figures
@sonney2k	and the small preview?
@sonney2k	did you resize manually?
 bern4rd	yes
 bern4rd	i resized them manually
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how is it possible that get_mean causes a call to ~SGVector? I included the method get_column_vector too
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/3EDypHze
 bern4rd	the big picture is in static/figuares and the small pictures in static/design
 bern4rd	i thought in resize them with html and/or css but although you resize them to a smaller one you are loading the big one and needs more time to load the page
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ok understood. I will add a few more...
@sonney2k	bern4rd, admin page is still under /admin right?
@sonney2k	for some reason I have problems logging in
 bern4rd	yes, using /admin/ url

 n4nd0	blackburn: what is it?
 blackburn	I need any of you :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay
 blackburn	n4nd0: please go to applications/ocr and run train
 blackburn	with latest git
 blackburn	it will update saved SVM model
 blackburn	so please commit it too
 blackburn	I am unable to do that because I am using browser and I am under win7 now
 blackburn	everything is against me lol
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	mmm I cannot really update right now man ...
 n4nd0	I am trying to find out why qda breaks in ~SGVector
 n4nd0	is it urgent?
 n4nd0	I mean like more urgent than fixing qda example
 blackburn	it depends when sonney2k want to release :D
 n4nd0	it is another example that breks indeed
 blackburn	ah no, fix it
 n4nd0	blackburn: can you please take a look to the pastebin I put ^
 n4nd0	I don't know why can it be that the code there calls ~SGVector
 blackburn	yeah I've seen - what is the exact problem?
 blackburn	so it calls destructor and you've got no vector anymore?
 n4nd0	but why does it call the destructor?
 n4nd0	it makes no sense for me
@sonney2k	blackburn, no release today at least
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ok works thx
 blackburn	n4nd0: how did you detect that?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I think so too
 n4nd0	blackburn: that the constructor is called?
 n4nd0	valgrind complains about it
 blackburn	n4nd0: destructor?
 n4nd0	and I am printing it out too, just to confirm
 n4nd0	yeah, destructor sorry
 blackburn	where is it called? right in that method?
 n4nd0	after SGVector's constructor
 n4nd0	it provokes the call to it
@sonney2k	blackburn, I forgot to put the vodka on ice - so no way we can release today
 blackburn	sonney2k: hot vodka tastes better!
 blackburn	and smells
 n4nd0	blackburn: somehow, the constructor is calling the destructor this causes to call unref, free_data, and boom!!
 blackburn	ehhm that's strange for sure
 CIA-27	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r60f20df / applications/vw/vw.cpp : Updated VW application - http://git.io/RgDSVw
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I have no idea how it comes that the destructor is called
@sonney2k	bern4rd, ok I've put more screenshots under http://shogun.7nn.de/page/home/
 blackburn	sonney2k: can we drop sailfish?
 blackburn	it is commented whole way
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 regarding the website - shouldn't we have applications instead of screenshots?
@sonney2k	err preview
 blackburn	yes that's better
 blackburn	n4nd0: me neither actually
@sonney2k	blackburn, drop it
 blackburn	okay will drop tomorrow
 blackburn	I have to get some sleep now
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 - what do we do with the follow us on twitter?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: any clue about the destructor thing?
@sonney2k	follow us on github?
 blackburn	sonney2k: create an twitter account?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no - buried in the website code
 n4nd0	put a link to blackburn's twitter
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: hah that would be strange shogun representative
@sonney2k	blackburn, can github twitter when we push things etc?
@sonney2k	buildbot too?
@sonney2k	then twitter makes sense
 blackburn	no, I think twitter should be for different things
 blackburn	Shogun now have SUPER-X algorithm
 blackburn	has I mean :D
 n4nd0	that is a good idea actually
 blackburn	sonney2k: nobody is interested about our commits
 n4nd0	I like it
 n4nd0	bern4rd and I are twitter's experts :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so then create some shogun-toolbox twitter account and we can link it
@sonney2k	blackburn, github has twitter notifications...
 n4nd0	we are not good at making accounts, we are good at page-ranking twitter ;)
 blackburn	whatever - it makes totally no sense to expose our commits to twitter
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 could you maintain the twitter stream?
 blackburn	we should have an account tracking new features and algorithms
 blackburn	I think I can handle that
@sonney2k	like at least weekly news?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	ok then create a twitter shogun-toolbox account
 blackburn	okay leaving - lets chat tomorrow more :)
 blackburn	see you later
 n4nd0	blackburn: good night
 blackburn	nite

 n4nd0	nice
@sonney2k	bern4rd, is there any chance to align the arrows in new news box?
 gsomix	good evening
 bern4rd	sonney2k: I have done it for one table, i go to dine and i will do the others
 bern4rd	probably is possible, but is html/css stuff
@sonney2k	n4nd0, any idea what we should put at the bottom? I mean this 'check out also these great products' things?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, it looks weird currently
@sonney2k	bern4rd, btw how is the NEWS updated?
 bern4rd	each time you call /home url the parser is called, here I check if there is any file in /news directory that is more recent than the last date updatet
 bern4rd	in other apps i have done i directly create a method loadNews (for example) that remove all elements and reload them again
 bern4rd	the first option is not working good?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how is the file getting into the /news directory?
 bern4rd	parserXML.py when the object is created
 bern4rd	in def __init__() the variable newsfolder
@sonney2k	bern4rd, I don't get it - do I have to run parserHTML.py in some cron job or ?
@sonney2k	or parser.py?
