 Yanglittle	Hey, how can I get the info of methods in detail except help , eg. shogun.Features.CombinedFeatures.append_features.obj(),
 Yanglittle	I'm reading the examples, and not know the meaning of the methods clearly.

@sonney2k	foulwall, once you feel better we should try to get your regression demo into the shogun homepage
 foulwall	sonney2k: maybe tomorrow?
@sonney2k	foulwall, ok - please check out https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web tomorrow - we could then under some link say /demos/regression put in the examples
 foulwall	sonney2k: gotcha
@sonney2k	foulwall, but take care health is more important!

 iglesiasg	let me ask you a basic ML question regarding the classical SVM formulation for classification
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: ship it to my address and I give it to you when you are here :D
 lambday	hi lisitsyn
 iglesiasg	so the objective looks like: \min_{w, \Xi} ||w||^2 + C \sum \Xi_i
 iglesiasg	the regularization part, ||w||^2
 iglesiasg	I think of this part as that is the one that actually takes care of margin maximization; it can be seen equivalent to \max M where M is the margin and fixing the norm of w to 1/M
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: makes sense - I should ask carol
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@lisitsyn	lambday: hi
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes regularization is margin
 iglesiasg	but I remember once that Georg told me that it was also there because it can be proven that an arbitraly high norm of w can fit perfectly to data
 iglesiasg	so it is there actually to avoid overfitting
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes bigger margin - less overfitting
 iglesiasg	I guess it is another point of view of the same concept, however I think there is something that I miss
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: there are a few views on that
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 lambday	I've been trying to use SGVector constructor (data, vlen).. when I take a pointer and use new, its all fine but when I don't I'm getting a weird error...
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: another thing is
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: but why arbitrarily high norm of w can perfectly fit data?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: in geometrical or?
@lisitsyn	lambday: what is the error?
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I don't know, in any way it can be understood - not necessarily geometrically if it cannot be seen like that
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well if you don't care about margin (regularization)
@lisitsyn	i.e. your C is low
@lisitsyn	you minimize the error on the training set
@lisitsyn	w/o any restrictions
@lisitsyn	so you fit perfectly or so
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: mmm
 lambday	corrupted double-linked list: 0x00000000017f0590 ***
 lambday	and then it prints the memory map
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: speaking geometrical margin has some other things
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: IIRC VC dimension has something to do with margin of a linear classifier
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: so it stands for complexity
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: the other nice view on that is
@lisitsyn	imagine you have w = [10,0.1,0.1]
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: ok
@lisitsyn	and w = [2,2,2]
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: latter is better because the distribution of coefficients is more smooth or so
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: in the first case you get feature 1 *very important*
 iglesiasg	I see
@lisitsyn	so regularization denies one to 'overfit' like setting big coefficients to some features
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: w/o regularization it could get like 1003402340, -32132132, 54545
@lisitsyn	but it would fit the data
 iglesiasg	that is why I see not so clearly
@lisitsyn	with no real induction
 iglesiasg	why bigger values fit better the data?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: that's not a rule it could happen
 iglesiasg	aham I understand
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: there are so many views on that
 iglesiasg	but say two instances of w
 iglesiasg	both of them of similar smoothness
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: if I was a physician I'd say something about fredholm equation :D
 iglesiasg	and both of them fitting the data more or less in the same way - so with \xi_i values sort of similar
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it is pretty illposed problem so would not expect that
 iglesiasg	if one of the vectors has high values and the other one low values
@lisitsyn	:)
 iglesiasg	why the one with low values should be preferred?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: why vectors?
@lisitsyn	are you talking about dual?
 iglesiasg	I am calling w vector
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	so you are asking why ||w|| -> min is preferred?
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 iglesiasg	well, because of definition ||w|| smaller implies larger margin I guess
@lisitsyn	1) it stands for margin (2/||w|| is the margin)
@lisitsyn	2) it stands for complexity (implied from margin)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it is not just implies - margin is exactly 2/||w|
 iglesiasg	agree
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	in VC theory they kind of proved that margin is related to complexity
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I like the complexity view - it unifies that framework with say decision trees
@lisitsyn	in decision trees you have no margin but you can derive something with MDL
@lisitsyn	minimum description length
 iglesiasg	aham
@lisitsyn	like the smaller your tree is the better it is
 iglesiasg	very nice theory indeed
@lisitsyn	I am wondering if some day some guy with proper brain would come with something better
 iglesiasg	that's why the world needs sonne|work to come back to research :)
@lisitsyn	I am afraid there is no such person yet at all

 lambday	hi heiko1
 heiko1	lambday:  hi!
 lambday	heiko1: in the sampling gaussian unit test for dense... shall I again use fixed cov matrix
 heiko1	lambday:  what do you mean by fixed?
 lambday	heiko1: not random... fixed values
 heiko1	lambday: I see, no random is better there
 heiko1	just compare empirical covariance with the original one
 lambday	that's what I was thinking :)
 lambday	yes.. norm..
 lambday	one more thing.. as of now, i'm testing both empirical mean and cov in the same test
 heiko1	lambday: yes, just frobenius norm or whatever
 heiko1	lambday: thats fine
 lambday	heiko1: okay...
 lambday	heiko1: thanks man :)
 heiko1	lambday: one more thing
 lambday	heiko1: yes
 heiko1	could you add a boolean flag to the method
 lambday	for?
 heiko1	called "precision_matrix" whose default is false
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 heiko1	and if it is true, the matrix is regarded as the inverse of the covariance matrix
 heiko1	so for a matrix C
 heiko1	one sometimes wants to sample N(0, C) and sometimes N(0, C^(-1))
 lambday	heiko1: okay...
 heiko1	lambday: I can send you matlab code how the sampling works if needed
 heiko1	basically just solve L\randn(...) system
 heiko1	you can use eigen for that

 lambday	heiko1: if precision_matrix is false, it would use C, otherwise it would use C_inv, in that case, it would use the cholesky factor of C_inv, right?
 heiko1	lambday: exactly, however, do not invert the matrix (since numerical problems)
 heiko1	just invert the cholesky instead
 lambday	heiko1: okay..
 heiko1	so in anyway, you have to compute C=L*L'
 heiko1	and then either you do L*randn(...) or (L^T )^(-1)*randn( ...)
 lambday	ummm..
 lambday	yes
 heiko1	lambday: https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/5371082
 heiko1	this is what I use in Matlab
 heiko1	in fact, it would be great if you could also offer these standard arguments
 lambday	heiko1: thanks... in the current code, I took a sample from N(0,I) of size Nxdim instead (ease of use with matrix_mean and matrix_cov method in Statistics.h)..
 heiko1	z is the standard Gaussian vector (if given, do not generate one)
 heiko1	inds is a permutation that you want to use
 heiko1	matrix_mean? matrix_cov?
 lambday	heiko1: matrix_mean for calculating empirical mean..
 heiko1	lambday: you mean in the test?
 lambday	heiko1: yes ..
 heiko1	yes, thats fine fine
 lambday	so, I used upper cholesky factor instead
 heiko1	oh wait, but please test on another matrix than I
 heiko1	identity
 heiko1	and non-zero mean
 heiko1	lower/upper doesnt matter
 heiko1	as long as the samples are correct :)
 lambday	heiko1: hmm..
 lambday	heiko1: for the normal case (precision_matrix = false), current code is working fine.. the empirical and the actual mean and cov are quite close..
 heiko1	lambday: also for non-zero, non-identity case?
 lambday	heiko1: yes.. :)
 heiko1	good!
 heiko1	if you want, we can already merge this - and then continue with the rest
 lambday	heiko1: few things left for the dense case..
 heiko1	did you follow the instructions of Sergey's mail?
 heiko1	lambday: yes?
 lambday	heiko1: for the gitflow?
 heiko1	lambday: yes
 lambday	heiko1: watched the video link you gave.. didn't try though...
 lambday	:(
 heiko1	dont worry
 lambday	heiko1: I did all the changes locally since then
 heiko1	ok
 heiko1	so first of all, create a backup :)
 lambday	heiko1: okay..
 heiko1	then run git flow init
 heiko1	it will ask you a few things
 heiko1	select develop and master for release and production
 heiko1	and default values for the rest
 heiko1	develop might not be in there
 heiko1	oh and  shogun_  as version tag
 lambday	heiko1: shall I commit first before doing this? I am using a temporary branch locally for this..
 heiko1	no, just make a backup
 heiko1	you can replace the files later and commit from the new structure
 heiko1	but make sure, things are not deleted by accident :)
 lambday	heiko1: alright...

 heiko1	lambday: the commands worked here
 heiko1	just do "git submodule init && git submodule update" inside the gitflow folder
 lambday	heiko1: ya.. it shows cloning into 'shFlags' but then connection timed out..
 heiko1	lambday: maybe re-checkout retry, its working here

 lambday	heiko1: Branch name for production releases: [master] ... I'm confused.. shall i put develop here or master? and yes you were right develop isn't here.. just showing master and another branch i've created locally
 heiko1	if develop is not there
 heiko1	create a branch
 heiko1	and then pull from upstream
 heiko1	lisitsyn: right?
 heiko1	then it is there
@lisitsyn	heiko1: yes iirc
@lisitsyn	it is a fork?
 lambday	it is a fork
 heiko1	lisitsyn: could you guide lambday thourgh the process of creating a PR? I am going out for lunch now
@lisitsyn	heiko1: good timing!
@lisitsyn	;)
 heiko1	lambday: ask lisitsyn, I will be back in 1 hr
 heiko1	lisitsyn: well we are trying for some time now :)
 lambday	heiko1: no problem.. ciao :)
@lisitsyn	heiko1: 1 hr!
@lisitsyn	:D

@lisitsyn	lambday: okay let me reproduce your issue here
 lambday	:D
@lisitsyn	and then I'll let you know how to proceed
 lambday	hmm
@lisitsyn	lambday: what does 'git remote -v' outputs?

 sonne|work	heiko1: could you please register with nickserv?
 heiko1	sonne|work: yes will do,
@lisitsyn	lambday: please do 'git fetch upstream'
@lisitsyn	and develop should appear
 sonne|work	heiko1: ohh and please be a bit more positive when you reply to students on the mailinglist - your replies are usually rough german style :D

@lisitsyn	lambday: yes shogun_ but it doesn't really matter
@lisitsyn	as you are not going to release yet :)
 lambday	okay
 lambday	lisitsyn: so, now if I want to commit, first i need to do git flow "sample_gaussian_dense" ... and then commit?
 lambday	i mean, git flow start "sample_gaussian_dense"
 lambday	then commits and then git flow finish "sample_gaussian_dense"... and then push..
@lisitsyn	lambday: git flow feature start sample_gaussian_dense
@lisitsyn	some commits
@lisitsyn	then git flow feature finish sample_gaussian_dense

 heiko1	just return SGMatrix (S.data ....)
 lambday	heiko1: when I tried to do otherwise, it gave a weird error
 heiko1	that does it
 lambday	ohkay
 heiko1	and another thing
 heiko1	could you generate column vectors?
 heiko1	as this is the shogun way to store them
 heiko1	so the result matrix is DxN
 heiko1	and set N=1 as default
 heiko1	lambday:  you can send the PR, I will check the rest in there (easier to comment)
 lambday	heiko1: okay... but then matrix_mean ias to be given "col_wise = false" right?

 foulwall	just modified the svr demo. the dots will no longer be saved on the server, so every time enter the page the dots are prepared dots, not the dots inputed last time. And all django views are merged into one function, with only one html template, no data model needed. the demo will be very easy to merge into shogun-web.
 foulwall	sonney2k:
 foulwall	I'll have a look at shogun-web.

 foulwall	yeah. thanks for caring.
 iglesiasg	no problem :)
 foulwall	I've checkout the shogun-web repo
 iglesiasg	good to hear it is better
 iglesiasg	foulwall: aham ok
 iglesiasg	foulwall: you need admin pass?
 foulwall	aha?
 iglesiasg	sorry?
 foulwall	which admin pass?
 iglesiasg	for the admin interface, but if it was not that, never mind :)
 foulwall	the site in repo or the site running?
 iglesiasg	for the site in the repo I meant
 iglesiasg	the one you run locally for testing
 foulwall	demo needs no data model. so there's no need for the admin panel
 iglesiasg	oh ok, I understand
 foulwall	what i need is a url router to redirect to my demo.

 foulwall	iglesiasg: sorry for my poor english.
 iglesiasg	foulwall: It is not a problem, don't worry for that
 iglesiasg	foulwall: ok, I think I understand what this rule is now
 foulwall	that is called a url router
 foulwall	and each request for that url is passed to their corresponding python function
 foulwall	late now, see you tomorrow, iglesiasg

@lisitsyn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, that should be enough spam
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: who are connectionists?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, now we should do the workshop announcement
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I would rather want to do a broad announcement
@sonney2k	like "shogun machine learning workshop"
@sonney2k	and then say that it will feature general (applied) machine learning talks
@sonney2k	with particular focus on the shogun machine learning toolbox
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: makes sense
@sonney2k	so we could have some people just generally interested in ML
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I should dig into books to learn something on machine learning then!
@lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, connectionists are the root of it all
@sonney2k	the neural net guys / nips roots etc
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am ashamed I didn't know about that list
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do they have a lot of discussions there?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I like ml-news better these days
@lisitsyn	embed(...,(method=LaplacianEigenmaps,eigen_method=Randomized))
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ^ it works :D
@sonney2k	:)
@sonney2k	I just realize I have to write sth to gunnar
@sonney2k	*argh*
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: did he agree?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, chris said so
@sonney2k	but that is about sth else
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: gunnar looks like a bigger big shot than obama
@sonney2k	this year gsoc is crazy - I mean it really ends late september
@sonney2k	and already did start now
@lisitsyn	yees
@sonney2k	it is like 6 months
@lisitsyn	I think we will all die
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, now or never ;)
@sonney2k	but ultimately I agree
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: our students will die too
@lisitsyn	endless summer
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: more connectionists?
@sonney2k	maybe it gives them the freedom to manage both studies & gsoc
@sonney2k	this stretching reduces and increases pressure at the same time
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes connectionists did not allow me to post from this address
