 cheng	Hi, I've just tried to get my head around why I am getting a segfault on "import modshogun". One warning I got was from cmake about MACOSX_RPATH. Should I set this?
 shogun-buildbot	build #773 of nightly_all is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_all/builds/773  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Parijat Mazumdar <mazumdarparijat@gmail.com>, Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>, Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@wiking	cheng: :< noup
 cheng	I wonder whether it could be one of the optional libraries, e.g. eigen3 (which I do not have) that is causing the segfault.
@wiking	cheng: mmm yeah i don't know really :<
@wiking	but it's a really strange error
 cheng	Could I use otool or something to work out what in modshogun is causing the error?
 cheng	One thing that is likely is that I am somehow using the wrong python to compile shogun. Is there a way to check?
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@117.239.94.112] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@wiking	cheng: i would go with lldb
@wiking	otool will only tell you the linkage trouble
@wiking	if there's one
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@117.239.94.112] has joined #shogun
 cheng	Hmm.. I've got to learn how to use lldb.

-!- pickle27 [~pickle27@192-0-136-118.cpe.teksavvy.com] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 cheng	lldb didn't give any insight. Basically said "trying to access memory 0x0"
 cheng	During make install, there are warnings about '-I .....' not used during compilation. Which seems strange to me.
 cheng	E.g. clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-I /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers'
@wiking	:<
 cheng	Those strange warnings are a ccache effect. Uninstalling ccache removes those warnings. But still no joy with segfault.
