 sonne|work	n4nd0: probably?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ? :)
 sonne|work	 n4nd0: sonney2k, sonne|work : is it possible to open the option of issues in shogun-web?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, so can you do it? hehe
 n4nd0	I didn't see anywhere how to fire an issue
 n4nd0	will check again
 sonne|work	n4nd0: at least I've received the PR but not time yet
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I hope it will work fine :)
 n4nd0	the tests I carried out here were good
 sonne|work	I hope so too
 sonne|work	did you manage to reset the admin password?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: no
 n4nd0	I didn't try it either
 n4nd0	I kind of guessed the one bernard set
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I see no reason to reset it mmm
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I will let you guess mine when I once forget it :D
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha ok but no guarantees :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: so you can hack emails?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it depends on the day of the week
 blackburn	we should get enemy and then use you for a war
 blackburn	I am curious what could be an enemy of shogun
 n4nd0	mmm
 sonne|work	blackburn: the guys that use cannons and pistols
 sonne|work	or worse
 sonne|work	shogun == ninja style
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	I thought we followed the harlem shake style!

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added simulate_h0 method to two-distribution based test statistics, which allows to sample the null hypothesis. This has to be handled in all methods that compute a statistic. Added handling for linear and quadratic time MMD. Changed the bootstrap_null method to use this flag

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: moved simulate_h0 flag to linear time MMD since in the case where data is stored, permuting it is easy: data is stored in one single feature object
