 shogun-notifier-	shogun: disable SSE on CYGWIN
@sonney2k	wiking, ^ that should fix the build on cygwin
@sonney2k	hushell, in case you are awake - could you please remove the pickle.dump code from your notebook?
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'cyg1 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build #1552 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes

@iglesiasg	hushell, hi there
 shogun-buildbot	build #548 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed updatedoc notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/548
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, do you know how to edit ipython notebooks?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yes
@iglesiasg	do ipython notebook in the directory where the ipynb file is
@iglesiasg	and then in the browser click on the notebooks's name you want to edit
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :develop * 50f3914 / data: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/50f3914e4aa55358cfa7d531c3410fa7ec34aec7
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: require new data version
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, now notebooks are being build and we get error msgs: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/548/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
@iglesiasg	I see
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and as you can see the path name for the Image.open is wrong for the bss_image example
@iglesiasg	aham yeah
@sonney2k	and i the FGM
@sonney2k	it fails to pickle.dump the result
@sonney2k	so these need fixing
 shogun-buildbot	build #62 of clang34 - static analysis is complete: Failure [failed analyse]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20static%20analysis/builds/62  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I dont' get though why lambday's logdet is not working
@sonney2k	it says invalid JSON
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and then finally yours
@sonney2k	LMNN is taking > 1200s
@sonney2k	buildbot timeout
@sonney2k	and killed
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, yep. As i mentioned in the message yesterday, I have to fix that.
@iglesiasg	It is my next thing in the list IIRC, should be able to do it tom
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, the sooner the better thanks
@iglesiasg	I am just going to cut down the dimensions that are used and ensure that it takes less time
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, the problem is that there are many outer products computed and the dimension here is 1472 or so
@iglesiasg	outer product is quadratic in the dimension so it turns out to be quite slow
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and this is already done in parallel as I've seen
@iglesiasg	so I just have to find a number of dimensions such that it can be computed fast enough for the purpose in the notebook, but also so the example remains meaningful
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, parallelized in my code?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well the process had load 8
@sonney2k	so I guess so
@iglesiasg	mmmm
@iglesiasg	I didn't do anything to parallelize it :)
@iglesiasg	maybe Eigen does something automatically about it?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, Eigen expert! :) ^
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you please do one thing
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, go to shogun/doc/ipython-notebooks/logdet
@sonney2k	and then ipython notebook and open that thing
@sonney2k	it always says here JSON error
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, all right. Let me try it
@sonney2k	so maybe the file is corrupt
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I cannot load the notebook even
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, exactly
@sonney2k	so I am removing it
@iglesiasg	An unknown error occurred while loading this notebook. This version can load notebook formats v3 or earlier.
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, maybe it happens because lambday made some edit of the ipynb manually

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix ipython notebooks
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - drop corrupt logdet.ipynb
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: - don't pickle dump/load results in FGM
@iglesiasg	I have experimented doing that and seen that error in the browser when I screwed an edit
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, maybe... no idea

@sonney2k	hurray
@sonney2k	cyg1 is green
@sonney2k	for the first time in 100 years :D
@iglesiasg	haha yeah
@sonney2k	and only 3400 warnings
@iglesiasg	"only"
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am running LMNN in the same data set in my laptop right now and monitoring top

 wiking	iglesiasg: hey
@iglesiasg	wiking, what's up
 wiking	we are getting 1 cell error in LMNN notebook
@iglesiasg	wiking, yeah, too much time, right?
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1687#issuecomment-25317993
@iglesiasg	wiking, I am on it right now. I am going to see if it gets fast enough reducing the number of features used
 wiking	this one is failing atm
@iglesiasg	wiking, "failing"
@iglesiasg	I think it is simply timing out
 wiking	okey
 wiking	i'm just copy-pasting :P
@iglesiasg	but anyway, yes. Let me do something about it
 wiking	no idea what's happening in depth
 wiking	iglesiasg: btw i dont think it's timeout problem
 wiking	as it was running for real25m1.033s
 wiking	25mins
 wiking	iglesiasg: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/LMNN.html
@iglesiasg	wiking, http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/548/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
 wiking	this the current output
@iglesiasg	wiking, check the very last thing
 wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/554/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
 wiking	this is the last build
@iglesiasg	all right
 wiking	as u can see from the html
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/LMNN.html#Multiclass-classification
 wiking	the second cell doesn't have an output
@iglesiasg	weird
 shogun-buildbot	build #64 of clang34 - static analysis is complete: Failure [failed analyse]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20static%20analysis/builds/64  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@iglesiasg	wiking, it is not the only one without output though
 wiking	yeah realised in the meanwhile :((
@iglesiasg	wiking, mmm the output is weird
@iglesiasg	it is not aligned with the corresponding cell
 wiking	huh
@iglesiasg	wiking, see for instance the cell you told me that it doesn't have output
 wiking	it's shifted or what?
@iglesiasg	it has it, but it appears after the next cell
 wiking	iglesiasg: ooooh
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i see
 wiking	let's check the ipynb
@iglesiasg	no idea why that is happening
@iglesiasg	but actually in that HTML everything went fine I think
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/LMNN.ipynb
@iglesiasg	wiking, in the ipynb it is like that as well
 wiking	yeah as suspected the generated ipynb has a problem :(
@iglesiasg	yes
 wiking	i wonder why's that
@iglesiasg	my bet is that it is because of the time
@iglesiasg	I mean we are seeing weird behaviour, sometimes it fails because of time out
 wiking	yeah
@iglesiasg	sometimes it doesn't but the output is cell-shifted
 wiking	iglesiasg: there's a 1000s timeout currently
@iglesiasg	wiking, for the whole notebook?
@iglesiasg	or waiting for a cell's output?
 wiking	cell
@iglesiasg	wiking, it should be more than enough actually. In my computer it takes half that time
@iglesiasg	wiking, but I guess the buildbot is just very loaded
@iglesiasg	wiking, so let me reduce the number of dimensions and experiment a bit with the time
 wiking	ok maybe there's still a little problem with the timeout settings
@iglesiasg	wiking, what is it?
 wiking	i've changed another timeout number in the generator script
 wiking	maaaybe it'll fix it
 wiking	i'm not 100%
@iglesiasg	wiking, ok
@iglesiasg	so I wait then :)

@iglesiasg	wiking, I have just made some tests, and using 500 features training takes about 40 seconds in my machine and the feature selection is still good
@iglesiasg	so I can easily update the notebook to do it this way

@sonney2k	van51, will you be around in the evening (in 2-3 hrs)?
@sonney2k	wiking, our sse2 detection is b0rken - that is why cygwin was failing
@sonney2k	wiking, I only did a workaround disabling sse2 on cygwin
 van51	sonney2k: probably yeah

@sonney2k	van51, pong
 van51	sonney2k: hey
 van51	sonney2k: did you see my comment on github?
@sonney2k	van51, yes but what I am saying is we don't really need that array at all
 wiking	sonney2k: bundle them
@sonney2k	wiking, no
 wiking	sonney2k: why not?
 wiking	they have both bundle options
@sonney2k	I don't like the bundle approach
@sonney2k	it is error prone
 van51	sonney2k: so should I try to replace it?
@sonney2k	wiking, I would rather say this is required - install it if you won't or go w/o
 wiking	system? if it's not a package then bundle is better
 wiking	as it's tested
 wiking	and works
 wiking	in several builds;)
@sonney2k	wiking, it is tested now
 wiking	sonney2k: as i see with self installed lib u end up having problems (see pic)
 wiking	sonney2k: have u installed those packages on 7nn.de as well?
@sonney2k	wiking, it is the wrong approach IMHO - it is the work distributions should be and are doing
@sonney2k	wiking, no 7nn won't build any longer
@sonney2k	it is just the webserver now
 wiking	k
@sonney2k	van51, yes please
@sonney2k	van51, I think it would be best to use an SGVector for that task
 wiking	sonney2k: what was the problem with sse2?
 wiking	i mean we are using -march=native
@sonney2k	wiking, there is still
 wiking	so i dont really get how's this our 'fault'
@sonney2k	wiking, if we have HAVE_SSE2 on cygwin - all examples using random will crash - this is what we have seen
@sonney2k	van51, OK?
 van51	sonney2k: yeah
 wiking	sonney2k: does that machine have sse2?
 van51	sonney2k: on it
@sonney2k	van51, if you use SGVector you can just create a new one of appropriate size and assign it later to the member variable
@sonney2k	van51, then call resize() to squeeze it to the correct size
 van51	sonney2k: ok great. that's what I had in mind ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, well cat /proc/cpuinfo said so but no idea
@sonney2k	wiking, we need a real sse2 test code snippet that is run to be sure
@sonney2k	wiking, I couldn't find any proper sse2 detection for cmake (not even opencv has one)
@sonney2k	wiking, so I decided to disable it on cygwin
@sonney2k	wiking, but I guess we will run into trouble on older archs too
@sonney2k	van51, if you can - could you check who is using set_array() (from the original code) too - I mean the code there is wrong - it should free old memory and I suspect some copy & paste bug or other stupid error
@sonney2k	wiking, one more thing - about shogun vs. opencv
 van51	sonney2k: ok. right after I finish
@sonney2k	wiking, I think we should add an option in cmake to make it possible to use cv mat
@sonney2k	wiking, so we can have some fancy opencv examples later and for now just https://gist.github.com/pickle27/6751722
@sonney2k	van51, thanks tons!
 van51	sonney2k: np!
 wiking	sonney2k: afaik we should add helper function to do cv::mat <-> SGMatrix
 wiking	we've discussed this with sergey as well
@sonney2k	wiking, yes sure - would be easy to do - SGMatrix's etc are very very similar to cv mat
@sonney2k	wiking, and van51 could finally do the gender detection demo with opencv's face detector and shogun's lbppyr features
@sonney2k	wiking, but dependency is that we have cmake support for that
 wiking	sonney2k: it's easy
@sonney2k	if we have we can keep the example from pickle27
 wiking	sonney2k: there's opencv cmake detector
@sonney2k	wiking, just add it then
 wiking	provided by opencv itself
@sonney2k	wiking, so what is needed then?

 van51	sonney2k: I've updated the PR
 van51	going to eat now
@sonney2k	van51, does it work now?
@sonney2k	van51, and btw regarding memory - just drop the training data once you have the classifier and it did call init_optimization

 hushell	sonney2k: thanks! look great!
 wiking	hushell: your average testing error with bmrm is always around 0.24?
 hushell	wiking: you mean overfitted?
 hushell	wiking: I didn't tune much the regularization, but this result is similar to the results in Patrick's paper
 wiking	hushell: no the question is what number u usually get
 wiking	for testing error
 wiking	does it vary a lot or it's always around 0.24?
 wiking	sonney2k: current should be current and not a symlink to any release
 wiking	as it's a nightly build
 wiking	not any release build

@sonney2k	wiking, how do you do a release build then?
 wiking	you just make one manually
 hushell	wiking: yeah, it is always 0.2394, IIRC no random stuff in bmrm
 wiking	hushell: ok cool
@sonney2k	wiking, then please don't name it current but 'latest'
@sonney2k	wiking, for the documentation we have a scheme that takes the version number
@sonney2k	wiking, and installs under this version number the doc
@sonney2k	wiking, then we have two symlinks
@sonney2k	wiking, current == currrent stable release
@sonney2k	wiking, and latest == latest developer build
 wiking	sonney2k: eh why?
 wiking	current is current
 wiking	stable is stable
@sonney2k	wiking, then you have to change this in doc too and update all links everywhere
 wiking	that's kind of defacto rule
 wiking	for all sw releasing
