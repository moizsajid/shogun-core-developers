@sonney2k	houston we have a problem
@sonney2k	our build needs >3GB for building
 wiking	:D
 wiking	3GB of what? :)
@sonney2k	RAM
@sonney2k	clang needs 3.5G
@sonney2k	g++ even more
@sonney2k	and that is w/o any optimizations enabled
 wiking	lol
 wiking	ah i guess the modular part takes that much
@sonney2k	wiking, it is the 20MB .cxx interface file
@sonney2k	it grew slightly (about 1M) after my SGVector & friends cleanups
 blackburn	in russia we take cases when locomotive team get drunk into account when scheduling :D
@sonney2k	wiking, that is why I don't want std:: and yet another template in .h's
@sonney2k	I have absolutely no idea what we can do about it
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build nightly_default
 shogun-buildbot	build #201 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes

 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, around? my master branch fails to compile
 heiko	is it my fault or is there a problem?
 blackburn	heiko: let me check
 heiko	blackburn, btw I am close to you, Warsaw
 heiko	blackburn, the error is
 blackburn	heiko: hah close
 heiko	lib/SGVector.cpp:76:41: Fehler: >>catlas_dset<< wurde in diesem G?ltigkeitsbereich nicht definiert
 blackburn	like 2000 km or so?
 heiko	and catlas_sset not defined
 heiko	yeah but closer than London :)
 heiko	but I have all installed
 heiko	atlas
 heiko	lapack etc
 heiko	gotta go
 heiko	see you later!
 wiking	heiko: what system?
 blackburn	heiko: hmm it compiles here
 heiko	blackburn
 heiko	wiking, ubuntu
 heiko	I will investigate a bit, but I will be kicked of the internet soon
 wiking	heiko: it's fucking crazy that u use german locale for gcc output :D
 heiko	wiking, I havent explicitly done this :)
 heiko	all automagic
 heiko	But you are right I should change this
 wiking	heiko: check where is catlas_dset defined
 heiko	its in the atlas/cblas.h
 blackburn	Sie haben eine probleme mit der Underbitshreikung
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	grep -r catlas_dset /usr/include/*
 wiking	heiko: is it for sure?
 blackburn	Nicht difiniert
 heiko	/usr/include/atlas/cblas.h:void catlas_dset
 heiko	blackburn, dEfiniert :)
 wiking	heiko: mmm that's funny
 blackburn	Fehler die wurde scheisse SGVector nicht definiert gesselschaft mit beschraenkter haftung
 wiking	heiko: and u have a -I/usr/include/atlas flag among your CFLAGS?
 blackburn	ok no more german words (including non-existent) I know left
 heiko	wiking, should, let me check
 wiking	heiko: because cblas.h is included in
 wiking	shogun/mathematics/lapack.h
 wiking	and that's included in SGVector.cpp
 wiking	i guess u dont have MKL
 wiking	and since u run ubuntu HAVE_MVEC is not an option
 heiko	mkl is what?
 wiking	HAVE_MKL
 wiking	dunno wtf is that
 heiko	so how to get it? :)
 wiking	is that defined in your .config?
 heiko	no
 wiking	i guess u don't have a -DHAVE_MKL flag
 wiking	ok cool
 wiking	so then the only thing is that
 wiking	u should have
 wiking	-I/usr/include/atlas
 wiking	#include <cblas.h>
 wiking	because of this
 heiko	this is not there
 heiko	but why
 blackburn	SGVektor
 heiko	I remember using this stuff
 heiko	maybe before update of ubuntu
 wiking	heiko: shogun/mathematics/lapack.h:31
 blackburn	EineWiderEineStrategie
 wiking	heiko: there's your include
 wiking	so if it finds the right cblas.h
 wiking	then u should have it
 wiking	but i guess there's something wrong with the include of the right cblas.h
 heiko	yeah probably
 wiking	find /usr/include -name 'cblas.h'
 wiking	do u have more than one output for that?
 blackburn	maquinas de supporto vectores
 heiko	/usr/include/atlas/cblas.h
 heiko	/usr/include/cblas.h
 wiking	hahah
 wiking	yeah
 heiko	blacbkrun goes wild again :)
 wiking	and i guess /usr/include/cblas.h doesn't have that catlas_dset
 wiking	function
 heiko	exactly
 wiking	heiko: well here's the rpboelm
 heiko	since it not atlas but just cblas
 wiking	well the thing is that we have to figure out how to resolve this
 blackburn	communism! vodka! equality! hilbert spaces!
 wiking	as it's not only u who's gonna have this problem
 heiko	reproducing kernel hilbert spaces
 heiko	wiking, how to fix it with minimal effort? :) My mind always refuses to go into these kind of things :)
 wiking	:D
 wiking	heiko: u can just hack it for yourself for the moment
 blackburn	reproducing communism hilbert countries
 wiking	in shogun/mathematics/lapack.h
 wiking	and do #include <atlas/cblas.h>
 wiking	instead of #include <cblas.h>
 wiking	but of course in long run
 blackburn	heiko: I have bad news for you it is time to patch your kernel
 wiking	i have no fucking idea atm
 heiko	whaaaat?
 heiko	oh no
 wiking	hahahahah
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	I hoped to never do that again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
 blackburn	ok don't be afraid it is easy and takes just 3 hours
 heiko	no its faster here :)
 blackburn	you should have 3 hours there is nothing to do in warsaw :D
 heiko	At least I dont have to use MACOS ;)
 wiking	fuck actually there's a new kernel upgrade for LTS ubuntu
 heiko	well, drinking at the hotel lobby :D
 heiko	wiking I cannot download this here
 wiking	heiko: what?
 wiking	kernel upgrade?
 blackburn	so you visited poland to fight with football fans or what?
 heiko	counrty is not developed enough to provide stable fast internet
 heiko	blacburn, yes ;)
 blackburn	poland is developed enough in means of fights :D
 wiking	heiko: lol
 heiko	wiking, ok worked
 heiko	should this be changed?
 wiking	heiko: u cannot get any good inet in warsaw
 wiking	that's weird
 blackburn	heiko: you are a boxer come on
 heiko	or will it break other peoples build?
 blackburn	get your hands dirty
 wiking	heiko: yes
 heiko	blackburn, I am a friendly person and prefer using my mobile phone :)
 heiko	boxing is reserved for london
 blackburn	hmm okay smash your mobile phone in the face of a random person

 wiking	:D
 wiking	that's an irony there...
 wiking	boris boris..
 blackburn	yeah gorbachyov is still alive and pretty funny
 wiking	he liked to party :P
 blackburn	wiking: gorby is pretty old mentally though
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	he talks like an old old grandfather
 blackburn	which he is however
 wiking	"After Yeltsin's death, a Dutch neurosurgeon revealed that his team was secretly flown to Moscow to operate on Yeltsin in 1999. Yeltsin suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble as if in a drunken state"
 wiking	maybe he wasn't that drunk all the time :p
 blackburn	not all the time but he liked to get a glass
 wiking	"According to author and historian Taylor Branch's interviews with Bill Clinton, on a 1995 visit to Washington D.C., Yeltsin was found on Pennsylvania Avenue, drunk, in his underwear and trying to hail a cab in order to find pizza"
 wiking	:DDDDD
 blackburn	sounds like a movie not reality
 blackburn	wiking: we are all staring at putin's spine now
 blackburn	wiking: http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/7889576/7889576_original.jpg he doesn't look healthy
