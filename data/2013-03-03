 sumit	Hey blackburn , I appreciate the ideas , and just mailed you some of them that I am keen on working over , But could you also tell me what you expect from interactive machine learning demos?as in , any paradigm?
 sumit	and also , as for Dimension Reduction methods , shall I start with Auto - encoders first ? (from creating RBM class -> class for Stacks for RBMs , to train the auto-encoders for dimension reduction ?) the other options being working on kernel PCA ...

@sonney2k	n4nd0, what is the difficulty with css mangling?
@sonney2k	can't you just add the menu stuff to the end of the file?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no, not really
 n4nd0	because we already have a css with out stuff
 n4nd0	and this dropdown menu has it own css with its stuff
 n4nd0	since we basically want to use the elements we already have with the dropdown menu style
 n4nd0	we have to sort of combine both css
 n4nd0	if you just use the one in the dropdown menu -> the positioning of the elements screws completely
 n4nd0	sonney2k: see what I mean?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I found a way to beat all other libraries - float instead of double :D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: are we twice as fast then?
 blackburn	n4nd0: with some of methods
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but if you put them in some div then it should be no problem
 n4nd0	sonney2k: in principle :)
 n4nd0	so for example one the issues I was facing is
 n4nd0	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013
 n4nd0	if I put workshop 2013 at the height where registration and workshop program appear now
 n4nd0	then when hovering over workshop 2013, the dropdown menu is not visible
 n4nd0	not sure why
 n4nd0	probably sth related to the title div and the black image on the background
 n4nd0	in the test project I had created just with the dropdown menu, this trouble didn't appear
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is fixable of course, but it is not just copy+paste :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I see
 blackburn	is there anything better than django default admin console?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am going to unroll some crazy thing in tapkee
 blackburn	macro magic to add checkers for parameters
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you want to in django?
 n4nd0	blackburn: loop unrolling :)?
 blackburn	n4nd0: nothing - just curious as default one is cumbersome
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, variadic macroses
 n4nd0	blackburn: no idea what those macros are
 n4nd0	blackburn: django admin interface rocks!
 blackburn	n4nd0: PARAMETER(A,B,C,D) or PARAMETER(A,B,C)
 blackburn	n4nd0: variable arity
 n4nd0	aham!
 blackburn	n4nd0: I need it as I want to provide two possible impls of parameter macro
 blackburn	one without bounds
 blackburn	and one with checkers
 blackburn	PARAMETER(IndexType,                     k,                  NUMBER_OF_NEIGHBORS, IN_RANGE(k,6,end-begin));
 blackburn	n4nd0: ^ that's the example
 blackburn	I want to get rid of 'k' in IN_RANGE now, not sure if it is possible
 n4nd0	mm I am not sure either how can that be done
 blackburn	magic
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://cplusplus.co.il/2010/07/17/variadic-macro-to-count-number-of-arguments/ that's already crazy magic
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is a nice blog
