@wiking	lisitsyn, ping
 lisitsyn	wiking: sup
@wiking	lisitsyn, windoz
@wiking	anyhow
 lisitsyn	really
 lisitsyn	you've got some spare time huh?
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn, yep :) https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vigsterkr/shogun
@wiking	this is over the weekend project: )))
@wiking	now only the unit tests are failing to be compiled
@wiking	those ones are almost already fixed
@wiking	but then i suspect some of the examples/unit tests will actually fail (functionally)
@wiking	so yeah there's still some things to be fixed
@wiking	but it compiles at least :)
 lisitsyn	sounds cool
@wiking	i'll need you to review some of my patch
@wiking	when it's ready
 lisitsyn	ok let me know
@wiking	will ping u

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix unit tests for MSVC
@wiking	ok
@wiking	lets see this one
@wiking	but for now i leave this now for a while.. .need to work
@wiking	;)
@wiking	Saurabh7, pingpong
 Saurabh7	wiking: hi
@wiking	Saurabh7, so what happened there with euc dist?
 Saurabh7	wiking: no nothing, actually I was comparing with scikits precomputations on
 Saurabh7	and I thought something s wrong my bad
 Saurabh7	wiking: with this addition it should be good
@wiking	Saurabh7, you mean the distance values were wrong?
@wiking	lisitsyn, btw there's still for some reason a leaking error in generated examples: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20160813-0104.html
 Saurabh7	no just performance difference :)
@wiking	Saurabh7, with eigen it's faster now?
 Saurabh7	wiking: yes, when computing whole distance matrix
@wiking	Saurabh7, btw i wonder if we could use linalg backend? :))
@wiking	because this is great
@wiking	but we cannot use viennacl
@wiking	if we would like to
@wiking	because this is eigen only implementation
 Saurabh7	uhm definitely,
 Saurabh7	just need these guys in linalg map_result.colwise() += map_lhs_norms;
@wiking	mmm dont we have it already? :)
 Saurabh7	colwise addition of vector ?
 Saurabh7	not sure, wil check
@wiking	Saurabh7, please check in the feature branch as well
@wiking	on which oxphos is working on
@wiking	i mean the thing is that since this is a performance enhancement it's not so essential right now, we could merge it with OXPHOS' branch
 Saurabh7	okie
@wiking	see what i mean?
@wiking	i would rather have a PR/patch that fixes it for good
@wiking	instead of pulling this in now
@wiking	but then when we merge OXPHOS' branch we should repatch this to be able to use the linalg backend
@wiking	so if there's colwise() addition in there
@wiking	then let's make a pr against that branch
@wiking	if not let's talk with OXPHOS how much it would take
@wiking	to get that implemented
@wiking	how's the rotational forest coming along?
 Saurabh7	ok i will check
 Saurabh7	wiking: I was trying to set up the webpage and benchmark summary, will finish the ensemble thing now
@wiking	cool
@wiking	who created the random forest regression generated example?
@wiking	Saurabh7, ping
@wiking	lisitsyn, what is missing for switching to the new website?
 Saurabh7	wiking: hey, rf it was me i think
@wiking	Saurabh7, nevermind... the bug is somewhere else :)
