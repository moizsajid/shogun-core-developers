@HeikoS	wiking: jojo
@wiking	HeikoS, hi
@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@HeikoS	any updates?
@wiking	hi
@wiking	on?
@HeikoS	release
@wiking	yeah msged u
@wiking	did some stuff
@HeikoS	the windows yeah
@HeikoS	so infinite loop is not coming from openmp
@HeikoS	baaad ;)
@HeikoS	I will file another 5.1 issue I guess
@HeikoS	log is where again?
@wiking	https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vigsterkr/shogun/history
@HeikoS	thanks
@HeikoS	wiking: so anything I can help with the release?
@wiking	dunno man
@HeikoS	otherwise I will polish the wiki and website more
@wiking	how about the
@wiking	notebooks?
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	I have fixed more
@HeikoS	let me push
@wiking	ok push and then i re-run the generator
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I already pushed that yesterday
@wiking	ok lemme regen
@wiking	lets seee
@HeikoS	Intro
@HeikoS	is fixed
@HeikoS	the other ones: I dont get error message locally
@HeikoS	so maybe its worth that I do this thing that the ntoebooks are executed as python code
@wiking	pip install -U matplotlib
@wiking	and you will get them
@wiking	it's all about scatter()
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	weird because I had a scatter problem in the Intro one
@HeikoS	but the others went fine
@HeikoS	can i force the nighly default?
@wiking	matplotlib (1.4.2)
@wiking	this is on the nightly_default
@wiking	you can force anything
@wiking	but i've already forced it
@HeikoS	ok :)
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/6
@HeikoS	wiking: saw that sanuj got his blog post on the google blog?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	but is it already posted
@wiking	?
@wiking	or is it on the works?
@HeikoS	they posted 3/10
@HeikoS	his is 8 or so
@HeikoS	pretty cool
@HeikoS	I asked the others to write one as well would be cool
@wiking	yep saw it
@wiking	btw shouldn't we write to Gunnar?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but lets release first
@HeikoS	all the exposure to the old website hurts me :)
@HeikoS	I mean in reaching out to people to talk about it
@HeikoS	and then they come visit this old shiat
@wiking	:>
@wiking	lets see
@HeikoS	I already sent him the notes we made
@HeikoS	but we shoul dhave a hangout I think
@HeikoS	shall I ask about that
@HeikoS	wiking: email sent :)
@wiking	sure
@wiking	:+1:
@wiking	HeikoS, more problems
@wiking	:)))

@HeikoS	ok checking
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	wait
@wiking	there is something very wrong
@wiking	...
@HeikoS	I was searching for "error |"
@wiking	suddenly all of them are failing
@wiking	RuntimeError: Kernel died before replying to kernel_info
@wiking	:(
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	I mean we have to convert them to python and execute that first
@wiking	i might need to upgrade jupyter
@wiking	nono
@wiking	this is something else
@HeikoS	ok?
@wiking	lemme look at it
@wiking	in the meanwhile
@wiking	you should find out how to convert to pythno
@HeikoS	ok checking
@HeikoS	wiking: this guy right?
@wiking	which?
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/infra/blob/master/buildbot/scripts/generate-notebooks.sh
@wiking	what's with it?
@HeikoS	I modify that
@wiking	ah you can yeah
@HeikoS	to execute python code first
@HeikoS	or rather have another script
@HeikoS	might be better
@HeikoS	one execute_notebooks.sh
@HeikoS	one generate_notebooks.sh
@HeikoS	or?
@HeikoS	all in one?
@wiking	all in one
@HeikoS	kk
@wiking	AttributeError: 'AxesSubplot' object has no attribute 'set_prop_cycle'
@wiking	(in the regression notebook)
@wiking	should i just fucking downgrade
@wiking	the matplotlib?
@wiking	HeikoS, i think all the notebooks are failing on this
@wiking	too old matplotlib commands
@wiking	and i actually wonder what is your ubuntu version
@wiking	that you dont get these errors
@wiking	...
@HeikoS	yeah downgrade for now maybe?
@wiking	as this is running on a default debian jessie
@wiking	pacakge
@HeikoS	I have two upgrades
@HeikoS	so lots of shit on my system
@HeikoS	twice lts upgrade
@HeikoS	not clean
@wiking	yeah but what is your matplotlib version?
@wiking	yeah but still
@wiking	what the fuck is your matplotlib version?
@HeikoS	1.5.3
@wiking	1.3.1-1ubuntu5
@wiking	hahah lol
@wiking	then maybe i should UPGRADE
@wiking	not downgrade
@HeikoS	just upgraded
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	since we have 1.4.2
@wiking	ah ok
@HeikoS	let me run something
@HeikoS	which noteobok fails
@wiking	well then try regression
@HeikoS	since I just changed things
@HeikoS	k 1sec
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	more than 50% are failing
@wiking	so you have a 50% chance to open a shitty one anyways
@HeikoS	worked
@HeikoS	regression
@HeikoS	all cells work
@wiking	ok so should i upgrade then?
@wiking	to 1.5.3
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	yeah maybe try
@HeikoS	is that reversible easily?
@wiking	well
@wiking	it's fucking computers
@wiking	everything is reversible
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	then go for it
@HeikoS	I mean it is better to have this updated anyways
@wiking	ok done
@wiking	do you have the python command/
@wiking	i guess --to python
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	but its tricly
@HeikoS	just figuring that out
@HeikoS	because we use %inline stuff
@wiking	those inlines
@wiking	are discouraged to use no?
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	it is just executing the python file needs to be done with ipython as well
@HeikoS	so what works is
@HeikoS	find $1 -type f -name '*.ipynb' | xargs -P $2 -I{} jupyter nbconvert --to script '{}'
@wiking	ok rerunning
@wiking	shogun-buildbot_: force build --branch=develop 'nightly_default'
 shogun-buildbot_	build #7 forced
 shogun-buildbot_	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@HeikoS	wiking: and then need to do something about the graphics, so they are not displayed/blocking
@HeikoS	wiking: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/runipy
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	this is not good
@wiking	coz we have jupyer
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	though does what we want
@HeikoS	i.e. runs the cells nicely, showing error output
@HeikoS	wiking: it is maintained
@wiking	shocking
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	hahahha
@HeikoS	ah man
@HeikoS	https://github.com/paulgb/runipy/issues/122
@HeikoS	read this
@HeikoS	lets not use it
-!- CaBa [~Diu7saig@unaffiliated/caba] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@wiking	HeikoS, try gmm locally
@wiking	as it seems to be failing
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	Ill fix
@HeikoS	and push
@HeikoS	wiking: pushed
@wiking	k
@wiking	lets see what's with the others
@wiking	i wonder why no notification now about pushing to repo
@wiking	...
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
@HeikoS	wiking: sooo
@HeikoS	we can add this guy
@HeikoS	--allow-errors
@HeikoS	which is good
@wiking	what is that
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	allow cells to fail
@HeikoS	but actually
@HeikoS	not good
@HeikoS	since we wanna know
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	ah man
@HeikoS	these tools
@HeikoS	why is there no option to print the failing cell output
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	you know
@wiking	opensource
@wiking	if you dont like it send a patch
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	we could actually do this:
@HeikoS	we put the flag
@HeikoS	and then upload to some place
@HeikoS	and then read error there
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	yeah no thanku
@wiking	[10142929.139176] python[25657]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f962d7e0844 sp 00007fff189936d0 error 4 in libshogun.so.17.2[7f962d1bc000+1988000]
@wiking	theser are the beautiful ones
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i have a feeling that KNN is segfaulting
@wiking	can u actually test that locally?
@wiking	and pca_notebook.ipynb
@wiking	is definitely failing
@HeikoS	trying both
@wiking	fgm just failed as well
@wiking	hahahaha
@wiking	and tapkee now
@wiking	which worked before
 lisitsyn	tap kee
@wiking	prior the matplotlib update
@HeikoS	pca fixed
 lisitsyn	did I fucked up something?
@wiking	lisitsyn, as alwasy :D
@wiking	no
@wiking	things are messy
@HeikoS	knn segfaults
@wiking	HeikoS, yep i thought so
@HeikoS	uh
@HeikoS	wiking: ill have a look
@wiking	k
@HeikoS	but first want to get error message
@wiking	check tapkee
@wiking	that should be an easy fix
@wiking	since it's just some matplotlib shit
@wiking	as it worked before the upgrade
@HeikoS	wiking: works for me
 lisitsyn	how come tapkee + matplotlib?
@wiking	HeikoS, fuck i dont understand
@wiking	lisitsyn, old matplotlib
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: so, it seems that nbconvert should print the error
@HeikoS	https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/120
@HeikoS	I mean if a  cell fails
@HeikoS	the way you call it
@wiking	which version?
@HeikoS	thjs PR added that
@HeikoS	sept 2015
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	4.1 milestone
@wiking	jupyter (1.0.0)
@wiking	jupyter-client (4.2.2)
@wiking	jupyter-console (4.1.1)
@wiking	jupyter-core (4.1.0)
@HeikoS	wiking: so if I put an errorneous python statement in notebooks and run it using the jupyter-nbconvert command, I locally get a print in stderr or the thing that failed
@HeikoS	CellExecutionError: An error occurred while executing the following cell:
@HeikoS	------------------
@HeikoS	assert False
@HeikoS	------------------
@HeikoS	AssertionError:
@wiking	ok tell me the numbers
@wiking	(version numbers) you have locally
@wiking	i can pip upgrade then
@HeikoS	4.2
@wiking	fuck this fucking shi
@wiking	but which
@HeikoS	jupyter-nbconvert
@wiking	of what
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	i mean
@wiking	pip list|grep jupyter
@wiking	plz

@HeikoS	jupyter-client (4.4.0)
@HeikoS	jupyter-console (5.0.0)
@HeikoS	jupyter-core (4.2.0)
@wiking	ok
@wiking	upgrading
@HeikoS	let me know when there is a new log
@HeikoS	from log, I can usually fix things without running locally
@wiking	tomorrow
@HeikoS	cant force it to be there sooner?

@wiking	?
@HeikoS	and restart with my latest push
@HeikoS	had a mistake
@HeikoS	notebook will fail

@wiking	nono
@wiking	you can leave the opencv
@wiking	knn
@HeikoS	ah yes
@wiking	that has a segfault
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	man so bad :)
@wiking	:>
@wiking	it's worth to do it
@wiking	this way things gets fixed :d
@HeikoS	yeah I agree, checkign it atm
@HeikoS	wiking: hows the pipeline coming?

@HeikoS	wiking: jo!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jo!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I remembered you said covertree KNN was buggy?
@HeikoS	is that true?
@HeikoS	wiking: think I fixed the KNN issue
@HeikoS	I used gdb in fact to debug shogun from ipython notebook :)
@wiking	\o/
@wiking	yeey
@wiking	pushed?
@wiking	now it's only
@wiking	scene classification
@wiking	and knn is failing
@wiking	if we could fix knn that'd be great
@HeikoS	knn is fixed
@HeikoS	not yet pushed
@HeikoS	but i have local fix
@HeikoS	just running unit and integration tests to be sure
@HeikoS	wiking: so 5 mins
@wiking	kk
@wiking	i'm trying to fix that stupid job
@wiking	that it doesn't stop
@wiking	if one or more notebooks are failing
@HeikoS	wiking: it is weird with the notebook
@HeikoS	that must have been failing for a while
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	as this definitely was a bug in KNN
@HeikoS	but not in a recent addition
@HeikoS	general bug
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lol
@wiking	interesting
@HeikoS	might have to do with the refactoring of Euclidean distance
@HeikoS	Actually, I should check that I guess
@HeikoS	but I know why it breaks
@HeikoS	and fixed it, so all good
@HeikoS	man that class
@HeikoS	Knn.cpp
@HeikoS	really needs to be sorted out
@HeikoS	it is SO bad
@HeikoS	and old
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: oh and btw
@HeikoS	this sg_progress is quite nice
@wiking	what?
@wiking	ahhahah
@wiking	but man that's printf
@HeikoS	as when I press ctrl-c in python
@HeikoS	signal sorry
@HeikoS	CSignal
@HeikoS	it asks whether it should break from the loop
@HeikoS	that is very nice
@HeikoS	as program doesnt die
@HeikoS	just exists the loop
@wiking	yep
@wiking	we should generally have that implemented everywhere
@wiking	i.e. stop convergence
@HeikoS	yep
@wiking	but still have the model
@HeikoS	really good
@HeikoS	the progress would be cool to be iuntegrated into ipython
@wiking	ah but
@wiking	for progress
@wiking	i would use something like reactivecpp
@HeikoS	wiking: https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm
@wiking	https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp
@HeikoS	connect with this
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	lemme see wtf is this
@HeikoS	as progress bars are mostly useful in interactive sessions
@wiking	yep
@wiking	but would be cool
@wiking	that you can forward this
@wiking	to anywhere
@wiking	like not only your STDOUT
@wiking	but like tcp or whatever
@wiking	right?
@wiking	btw with Greg i had the idea
@wiking	to even be able to publish
@wiking	the state of the model
@wiking	i.e. to be able to monitor
@wiking	w
@wiking	how does it change iteration by iteration
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	great
@HeikoS	I guess first step is to forward
@HeikoS	that seems easy
@HeikoS	maybe comment in the issue I just created :)
@wiking	HeikoS, http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/06/29/breaking-out-of-loops-in-openmp/
@HeikoS	wiking: shall we still use openmp?
@HeikoS	since were moving to c++11 in 6.0?
@wiking	yes yes
@wiking	you are not going to implement
@wiking	a parallel for
@wiking	with std::thread
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	ok ill push now
@wiking	cool
@HeikoS	wiking: force da build
@wiking	just a sec
@wiking	wanna try to make it sure
@wiking	somehow
@wiking	that it still uploads the fucking notebooks
@wiking	even if there's only 1 fail
@HeikoS	kk
@wiking	dont really understand why haltOnFailure=False
@wiking	doesn't fucking work

@wiking	that generates modshogun_doxygen.i
@wiking	sonney2k_, around?
@wiking	 :)
@HeikoS	dont know anything about that
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	i wonder why docstrings are generated for everything but ruby
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	ah I see :)
@wiking	i dont even know that those docstrings could be used from java for example
@wiking	if not t
@wiking	then we are generating them
@wiking	for no use
@HeikoS	I dont know
@HeikoS	I guess
@HeikoS	this is another issue for 5.1 :)
@HeikoS	Ill create it
@wiking	HeikoS, btw
@wiking	what's the naming for python generated tests?
@wiking	as i believe we have currently a problem
@wiking	in the modular interface tests
@wiking	:))))
@HeikoS	haha
