 dhruv13	iglesiasg: regardig the kd tree implementation, bundling nanoflann is an option because it is a single header file with a BSD licence
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, ok
@wiking	dhruv13: what are the dependencies of nanoflann?
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, it sounds reasonable but what about deps?
@wiking	only stdc++ or some other libraries?
@iglesiasg	haha yeah exactly
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: stdc++
@wiking	iglesiasg: :D
@wiking	dhruv13: no boost or any other funky library right?
 dhruv13	nope
@wiking	that's good
 dhruv13	only, it says that it is optimised for 2d and 3d clouds, though i dont know how exactly
 dhruv13	still going through it
 dhruv13	so maybe i should first try to get it to work with KNN, and then play around with it to make it more efficient?
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, I guess it is pretty efficient already
@iglesiasg	at least I hope so :)
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: ha ha, no i meant i want to see why they say optimised for 2d and 3d clouds
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: I'll study some more and get back :-)
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, all right, it sounds great!

 kislay	HeikoS1, I have sent a PR regarding the issue #1878
 HeikoS1	wiking:  yeah :)
 HeikoS1	give it to me :)
 HeikoS1	kislay: I will check soon! :)
 kislay	thanks :)
 kislay	HeikoS1,  if you can point me over some issue regarding image processing/m-l algorithm which i may take up.!
 HeikoS1	kislay: maybe send a list to kevin (cc shogun-list) since he has some opencv applications in mind
 kislay	okay!

@wiking	HeikoS1: eigen solver: CPU vs GPU with magma
@wiking	HeikoS1: first column is the matrix size...
@wiking	CPU version is pure lapack...
 HeikoS1	wiking: man!
 HeikoS1	wiking: is that dense matrices?
 HeikoS1	wiking: ultra cool! Maybe update the issue with that and make it more sexy?
 HeikoS1	wiking: this in fact can also be very useful for the deep learning project
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah does are dense matrices
@wiking	HeikoS1: heheh deep learning is totally different
@wiking	HeikoS1: but it should use some sort of opencl/cuda stuff for sure
 HeikoS1	wiking: cool!
 HeikoS1	wiking: man if we would use those solvers for all things in shogun that would be a blast
 HeikoS1	imagine the nice notebooks comparing performance of say PCA
 HeikoS1	if one change change the backed in one line
 HeikoS1	amazing!
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah i'm just trying to refactor a bit the eigensolver of lambday and then change everywhere to it where we do eigen solving...
@wiking	HeikoS1: that'll allow us to later have support for GPU/OpenCL based eigensolvers

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add streaming mmd, refactor linear time mmd
 HeikoS1	wiking: thats all great
 HeikoS1	wiking: what do we need in order to make this work on all eigen operations?
@wiking	HeikoS1: well that's really tricky
@wiking	HeikoS1: i mean if ever this eigen-magma thing is going to be part of eigen then things are easier
@wiking	HeikoS1: but other than that we'll have to do all sorts of wrapping
 HeikoS1	I see
 HeikoS1	wiking: ok, maybe wait then, but we can start with the solvers
 HeikoS1	wiking: besser82 once told me that once can just change one header and everything works out of the box
 HeikoS1	but I guess that might be a bit too optimistic
@wiking	HeikoS1: mmm i dont know about such a library
@wiking	HeikoS1: i mean the thing is that there are several different libraries out there... not only eigen
@wiking	that can do some basic math functions
@wiking	so this is why better do wrappings
@wiking	of these basic functionalities
@wiking	so that we can support different libraries... not only eigen
@wiking	the problem is that eigen is spreading all around our code
@wiking	which is stupid
@wiking	because then we'll have to do similar thing like now with lapack->eigen
@wiking	it'd be better to start creating wrapper classes
@wiking	and do there library dependencies
 HeikoS1	wiking: I see
 HeikoS1	wiking: mmmh
@wiking	instead of like whole functions like now for PCA or ICA
@wiking	this is just calling for suicide in the long run
 HeikoS1	wiking: I agree for operations like SVD/EVD
 HeikoS1	wiking: but you think also for matrix*matrix and matrix*vector multiplication?
 HeikoS1	wiking: cholesky is another thing
 HeikoS1	wiking: maybe you are right
@wiking	well there comes all the factorizations as well
@wiking	QR, cholensky etc.
 HeikoS1	wiking: then it would be much easier to change the backend, if everything would be like in linalg
 HeikoS1	yeah
 HeikoS1	mmmh
@wiking	there are like n different libraries that does it fast
 HeikoS1	wiking: entrance task?
@wiking	one is opencl optimized
 HeikoS1	wiking: yeah I totally agree
@wiking	the other is CUDA optimized
@wiking	etc.
 HeikoS1	wiking: thing is that one has to think of interfaces
@wiking	yeah these has to be all interfaced
 HeikoS1	wiking: I did that for some lapack things, and its ugly
@wiking	like in java
 HeikoS1	all those optiones
@wiking	and do separate implementations of them
 HeikoS1	wiking: what about doing this step by step
@wiking	i mean everybody should try to stick to SGMatrix and SGVector
 HeikoS1	wiking: we can stard with EVD/SVD for now
@wiking	and pass aroudn that
 HeikoS1	start
 HeikoS1	see how it goes
 HeikoS1	and then update things one-after another
@wiking	and then either it is going to be eigenized or some other funky library used to do that operation
@wiking	HeikoS1: yeah SVD is very similar
@wiking	there should be an SVD solver class in shogun
 HeikoS1	wiking: I agree
@wiking	and that should handle all the library dependency etc....
 HeikoS1	wiking: so what about adding this stuff to the linalg framework?
 HeikoS1	which was started by lambday?
@wiking	and then some global variable can be used to choose SVD engine on the library's level
 HeikoS1	wiking: could you write a detaled intro task for that, maybe for SVD?
@wiking	same with eigen
@wiking	yeah i'll do that
 HeikoS1	fundamental multiplications can come later
 HeikoS1	maybe start with a factorization
@wiking	yeah that's another story
@wiking	but factorization, svd, eigen solving is really something
@wiking	that should be pluggable
@wiking	*plugable
@wiking	meaning if you have a new fast way to do that
@wiking	you'll have to just create a wrapper for that inherited from the base class
@wiking	and then that is being used everywhere
@wiking	within shogun
 HeikoS1	yeah
 HeikoS1	great idea
 HeikoS1	in fact stupid to do anything else ;)

 lambday	wiking: hola!
@wiking	lambday: yoyo
@wiking	lambday: so i've already done some changes locally
@wiking	i'll push soon the first commit to a feature branch
@wiking	but let's finish up our discussion so i can make it right
 lambday	wiking: this is getting really exciting
@wiking	so about the naming
@wiking	do you maybe have a better naming idea for DirectEigenSolver?
 lambday	yeah - you don't like dense?
@wiking	DenseEigenSolver?
 lambday	yeah direct as in triangular solver
@wiking	ah ok
 lambday	ummm... but that works for dense
@wiking	well then let's keep it as is
@wiking	that solver is going to be working only with
@wiking	CDenseMatrixOperator and SGMatrix
 lambday	I really like the passing linear operator on the fly idea - that's how things should be
 lambday	wiking: yeah!
@wiking	so basically now i've added
@wiking	void compute(SGMatrix<float64_t> m);
@wiking	to CDirectEigenSolver
 lambday	wiking: awesome!
@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
@wiking	i wonder what happend though when u pass SGMatrix<T> as is on the stack instead of reference/pointer
 lambday	wiking: so you need to change just a bit at RationalApproximation::precompute() where we call the compute function
@wiking	isn't the whole class is being copied to the stack?
 lambday	wiking: nah the underlying memory is on the heap
@wiking	lambday: yeah i was wondering if u can just pintpoint me the lines
 lambday	it increases the refcount
@wiking	what i should put to the compute() in RationalApproximation::precompute
 lambday	umm just a sec then :)
@wiking	k thnx
@wiking	if i have that i'll compile/test locally and if it goes ok i'll push in a sec the whole feature branch
 lisitsyn	wiking: pong
-!- lambday_ [67157d54@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.84] has joined #shogun
@wiking	lambday: btw then LanczosEigenSolver should have compute(CLinearOperator<float64_t>* linear_operator), compute(SGMatrix<float64_t> linear_operator) and compute(SGSparseMatrix<float64_t> linear_operator) right?
 lambday_	wiking: sorry got dc
@wiking	lisitsyn: see above my question regarding stack + sgmatrix
@wiking	lambday_: nw
 lambday_	let me think
 lambday_	yeah
 lisitsyn	wiking: so pass-by-value of SGMatrix?
 lisitsyn	it increases refcount
 lisitsyn	then decreases
@wiking	lisitsyn: mmm good
 lambday_	you internally create the appropriate linear operator
 lambday_	and then do the rest
 lisitsyn	if compiler is valid (not visual studio) it shouldn't be optimized out
 lambday_	lisitsyn: lol @valid
@wiking	lisitsyn: vs will kill it?
@wiking	lisitsyn: really? :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: no I am just unsure
 lisitsyn	I am unsure about everything related to vs
@wiking	ah ok :> i thought u r talking out of experience
 lisitsyn	hah well out of other experience
 lisitsyn	e.g. covertree doesn't work with vs

@wiking	lambday_: ok so can u give me a small diff for CRationalApproximation, i.e. where do you have the LinearOperator?

@wiking	heheh yeah it's hectic lately
 lambday	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/linalg/ratapprox/opfunc/RationalApproximation.cpp#L114
@wiking	17:53 <@wiking> lambday_: yeah my cursor is there in the editor
 lambday	wiking: you should pass the linear operator (which is m_linear_operator)
@wiking	where's the linear operator that i can pass to compute?
 lambday	wiking: its in the base class of RationalApproximation, COperatorFunction
@wiking	lambday: mmm ok. where do u create the EigenSolver?
 lambday	protected
@wiking	lambday: since we have to remove the linear operator from the ctor of EigenSolver
 lambday	wiking: things are created externally
@wiking	lambday: ah i see.. unit test?
 lambday	wiking: umm... there are few unit-tests
@wiking	or example?
 lambday	and examples, both
 lambday	:(
 lambday	sorry :(
 lambday	wiking: can't we jointly contribute to your feature branch? then I can help
 lambday	before merging to develop
 lambday	wiking: do a quick grep :P
@wiking	lambday: mmm ok i can now push these changes into a feature branch
@wiking	lambday: RationalApproximation ?
@wiking	grep for thi?
@wiking	this
 lambday	wiking: nah EigenSolver
 lambday	rational approximation is just another base :P

 lambday_	wiking: where?
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/mathematics/linalg/LogDetEstimator_unittest.cc#L98
@wiking	is it safe just to remove op from the operator?
@wiking	right...? as we'll have reference on op within CLogRationalApproximationIndividual right?
 lambday_	wiking: I think so, its SG_REF'ed anyway
 lambday_	wiking: oh have it SG_REF'ed within the compute
 lambday_	wiking: and SG_UNREF in the end
@wiking	same goes for line 187, 272, 328, 394,
@wiking	right?

@wiking	lambday__: and of course the same question goes for

@wiking	lambday: well now my only concern here of course
@wiking	compute_all vs compute_extremal...
@wiking	as i really dont want to do these changes 2 times :)))
 lambday	lol
 lambday	:D
 lambday	the eigen solvers that we have are actually meant for extremals
 lambday	see there are two data members for max and min eigenvalues :P
 lambday	wiking:which ideally should be removed alltogether
 lambday	and compute_extremal  should return a shogun_wrapper for std::pair
 lambday	and compute_all a SGVector

 kislay	wiking,  is there any way to push changes in the shogun/data folder without cloning everything present in it.
@wiking	kislay: you'll have to do the fork
 kislay	that i did.
@wiking	kislay: so they u fork it + add your changes
 kislay	i am able to push my other commits, but changes in the data folder are not showing up
 kislay	actually, i had to add my dataset.
@wiking	and do a PR against shogun-data
@wiking	kislay: nono
@wiking	kislay: that won't work
@wiking	dont do changes within the data submodule
@wiking	you have to fork the data repo
@wiking	do the changes
@wiking	commit
@wiking	and then PR against the shogun-data
 kislay	oh!!!
 kislay	as simple as that
 kislay	pfff
@wiking	yeah something like that

 thoralf	Nono, I mean, which indent style.
 thoralf	indent <-- The command line tool.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I have no idea what do you mean by that then :D
 thoralf	indent <-- A unix tool to format code.  It has different styles. ;)
 lisitsyn	oh never used that :D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: okay then no idea ;)
 thoralf	What are you using?
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I just write it formatted already
 thoralf	lol
* thoralf writes in different languages - and every language has different styles.
 thoralf	For tabs/spaces, for braces, for everything.
 thoralf	I'm always mixing this up, so I want my computer to fix that.

 cameo54321	Hi wiking: Got a sec?
@wiking	shoot
 cameo54321	I am trying to link stan with shogun
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@e179065162.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@wiking	cameo54321: oh that's going to b fun
 cameo54321	have been fiddling with cmake files of shogun for quite some time, but of no use..
 cameo54321	haha
@wiking	cameo54321: but i'm afraid that is going to be rather hard...
@wiking	i mean rather hard to convince ppl here to be integrated
 cameo54321	Very much... stan doesn't have a cmake kind of structure
 cameo54321	And no configure scripts either
 cameo54321	just a custom make file
@wiking	as it really dpeends on some heavy weith stuff
@wiking	*weight stuff like boost
 cameo54321	Yeah.. By the way i got shogun to identify boost if installed on the system
 cameo54321	I also went though the cmake files in cmake/external
 cameo54321	tried to mimic the behavior there.. still no use..
@wiking	mmmm
 cameo54321	Any ideas what can be the right approach to do that?
@wiking	cameo54321: why does stan depend on boost btw?
 cameo54321	Good question.. I am unable to figure out yet.. but it seems it depends on boost quite heavily..
@wiking	cameo54321: can u give me a link to the library's src?
@wiking	like github link or something
 cameo54321	ya sure
 cameo54321	https://github.com/stan-dev/stan
@wiking	oh man these guys are even crazier than we are... storying full libraries in their repo
@wiking	...
 cameo54321	!
@wiking	shit seriously we do not want to depend on this library
@wiking	i mean i understand in a way
-!- kislay [~kislay@93.114.45.13] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@wiking	but isnt there a better library
@wiking	this one is crazy
 cameo54321	Heiko pointed this issue... https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1875
 cameo54321	opened*
 cameo54321	His suggestion was  that we can make cmake to download stan into external_libs dir just like colpack/eigen3(if nonavailable), etc
@wiking	yea that was not a good idea
 cameo54321	Please see this: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/%23shogun.2014-03-07.log.html#t18:36
@wiking	cameo54321: i do understand that heiko wants to have this
@wiking	but this is not a good idea
@wiking	im sorry for the contradiction
@wiking	but integrating this especially as a bundle is really too much
 cameo54321	The other way is that we can build these ourselves
@wiking	this will bloat shogun like with another 500megs
@wiking	nobody wants that
 cameo54321	Can there be a way if we just pick some code base classes from stan?
@wiking	well that could be an option... but i've just checked some stuff and it's really heavily bundled with boost
@wiking	and we really would like to be dependent on boost
@wiking	i'm sorry i have to be like this
@wiking	i wouldn't rush myself into this if i were u
 cameo54321	haha no prob
@wiking	imo heiko made a rush about this before checking out the status of stan
 cameo54321	Well we'll develop stuff ourselves then..
 cameo54321	May be get some inspiration as to how they structure some basic stuf... Class heirarchies for example..
 cameo54321	but build stuff on our own, using boost...

 thoralf	wiking: Hey.
 thoralf	wiking: How would you read multilabel files in shogun?
 thoralf	It's about 3-4 lines in perl, but about 100 in C++.
 thoralf	I'd be happy to have it in 20 or less lines ;)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	thoralf: official svmlight doesn't support it? or?
 thoralf	No, it doesn't.
 thoralf	But it's text-based.
 thoralf	<hacky idea>We can put it in the first column without spaces.</>
@wiking	the svmlight format does not support the multi-label data representation. You should convert your data into arff format.
@wiking	^ from a group discussion
 thoralf	Hmm.  But svmlight is so easy to generate. :)
 thoralf	And it's <labels><space><data>
 thoralf	Anyway, the file I'm reading in MultilabelLabels is simply "1 2 3 4 7 9" per line.
 thoralf	No features attached to this.
@wiking	yep  get it
