@wiking	lisitsyn1: the only thing we'll still have to do is to check all the included libraries  :D
@wiking	lisitsyn1: like libqp is gplv3
 lisitsyn1	wiking: ha
@wiking	so either we somehow fork that out or i have no idea
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	and as well u've imported some code
@wiking	that u have the agreement for gplv3
 lisitsyn1	oh shit
 lisitsyn1	yeah
 lisitsyn1	slep and malsar
@wiking	yes
@wiking	those needs to be checked by the author
 lisitsyn1	well actually
 lisitsyn1	I am the author of code
@wiking	and i guess we'll have to prepare ourselves for the situation where somebody is going to disagree
 lisitsyn1	it is just ported from matlab one
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn1	I don't know how this works with ports
@wiking	mmm yeah we'll have to figure out
 lisitsyn1	ahhh no there is a bunch of imported code as well
@wiking	i'll try to get some expert's opinion
@wiking	about this
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	maaaybe
@wiking	what we will have on the end
@wiking	like gstreamer
@wiking	once we have the modular stuff
 lisitsyn1	I personally don't mind to lose anything
@wiking	we just 'dump' the stuff that cannot be bsd licensed
@wiking	into one package
@wiking	that is going to be gpl marked
@wiking	and problem solved
 lisitsyn1	yeah
@wiking	we use that via api
@wiking	and voila
@wiking	then i think we are not breaking licensing
@wiking	and if somebody needs that module licensed under bsd
@wiking	well then he/she can do the porting
@wiking	anyhow this should be just after

@wiking	when we cleared up everything
@wiking	with the individual contributors
-!- Netsplit over, joins: zxtx
@wiking	we need to finalize the idea list for gsoc 2014
@wiking	lisitsyn1: if u have some time could u add more 'blablabla' to 'Implement an easy to use modelselection API
@wiking	plz
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeah sure
@wiking	lisitsyn1: is this 3 liner bsd? http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/COPYRIGHT
 lisitsyn1	wiking: I just put some draft here
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeah
@wiking	lisitsyn1: yeah no worries just that we soon have to publish it
 lisitsyn1	wiking: I wanted to add another one
@wiking	ok so with libsvm we are good i guess
@wiking	lisitsyn1: go ahead
 lisitsyn1	on some matrix factorization
 lisitsyn1	wiking: liblinear libsvm are ok
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	als?
 lisitsyn1	wiking: remember iphone
@wiking	or svd? :)
@wiking	ah yeah
@wiking	iphone true
 lisitsyn1	wiking: yeah ksvd may be
@wiking	ah yeah cool
 lisitsyn1	wiking: feature learning for the win
 lisitsyn1	:D
 lisitsyn1	I hate to engineer features
 lisitsyn1	wanna put it raw and get stuff back
@wiking	lisitsyn1: yeah would be cool to actually have some feature selection stuff as well
@wiking	the most stupidest way would be random forest
 lisitsyn1	wiking: it is a shame we still don't have it
@wiking	heheh tell me about it
@wiking	well as soon as we have a decision tree implementation
 lisitsyn1	wiking: we should have at least what opencv has
@wiking	it's really just a 3 liner to have random forest
@wiking	basically one just needs to put that decision tree into baggingMachine
@wiking	and booom
@wiking	:)
@wiking	here we can use this
@wiking	https://github.com/zuqqhi2/RandomForest/blob/master/lib/randomforest.js
@wiking	:DDDD
 lisitsyn1	wiking: ahh yeah we can employ your begging machine
@wiking	fucking protobuf
@wiking	lol http://about.wise.io/
* wiking is getting tired of bootstrap sites :)
 lisitsyn1	wiking: hah yeah it is what sucks now
 lisitsyn1	before it was like about absolutely ugly websites
 lisitsyn1	but now it is all around bootstrap
 lisitsyn1	not that ugly but you can't enter any market with it I believe
@wiking	well everybody's bootstrapping now :D
@wiking	thnx to twitter :)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix libc++ and libstdc++ mixup on OSX with swig 2.0.11 or earlier
@wiking	sonney2k: this should actually do u some good with swig 3.0.0
@wiking	it'll try to compile it with libc++
@wiking	that should be fine with swig 3.0.0
@wiking	as well as make it working with swig 2.0.11
@wiking	as mixing libc++ compiled libshogun with libstdc++ compiled modular interface is just a big failure :<

@sonney2k	wiking, due to the incompat of python2 & 3 I would go with besser82's suggestion and just create another directory with the python3 data
@wiking	sonney2k: fine by me
@wiking	sonney2k: i was only bitching the way the whole libc++ got handled
@wiking	that solution basically broke every modular interface under osx
@wiking	sonney2k: next osx python build should be interested as that will enable c++11 with libc++ for swig as i see that u've installed swig HEAD on that osx machien
@wiking	*machine
@wiking	btw i told u guys that fixing python3 will be a big bitch... i knew this back in 2013 summer when i was doing the whole cmake port....

@wiking	but my favourite committers are like
 thoralf	But this 80 might contain duplicates, right?
@wiking	root@<something>
@wiking	:)
@wiking	thoralf: indeed
 thoralf	lol
* thoralf loves developing as root.
@wiking	although we are still missing signatures from sonney2k  and gunnar :) so that's going to be fun if they dont sign :>
 thoralf	Who is this sonney2k anyway? ;)
@wiking	hehe
* thoralf suggests a poll: At which age did you stop using root as your primary account?
 thoralf	12? 13? ;)
 thoralf	lisitsyn1?
 lisitsyn1	thoralf: haha
 lisitsyn1	thoralf: I can't remember I ever used root actually
 thoralf	If it's bigger than 16 then you'll probably become sysadmin. ;)
@wiking	sonney2k: there's something still wrong with the new swig generated interface... some tests are timeouting for some reason
 lisitsyn1	thanks %deity I am not a sysadmin :D
@wiking	if it's a swig related problem then we might want to figure it out fast as they are preparing the 3.0.0 release

@HeikoS	Hi all
@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking, lisitsyn just recruited another mentor for GP/variational inference stuff. Pretty excited about that project
@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@HeikoS	wiking: yo!
@wiking	HeikoS: cool we need a more detailed description
@wiking	for your projects
@HeikoS	wiking: working on it
@wiking	or for the proejects that you've proposed but another menter
@HeikoS	had icml deadline last friday :)
@wiking	okok
@HeikoS	yeah yeah will do
@wiking	i'm just saying
@HeikoS	I think I will do two
@wiking	i.e. 'friendly reminder'
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, totally appreciated :)

@sonney2k	wiking, can you do anything about debian wheezy - memcheck ? I mean make it fail!
@sonney2k	wiking, the integration tests for mathematics_linsolver_cg fails also with python2 I guess that is why we don't have it
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah today i was trying to find in ctest manual why it's not returning -1 if it detect a memleak but no luck till now

@sonney2k	wiking, all the python3 tests fail due to scipy not being able to read files / mat files or they are not on python2

@wiking	although before doing that
@wiking	should have a look at
@wiking	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/18094206
@wiking	that's travis with python 3
@sonney2k	wiking, svmlight unknown?!

@sonney2k	!?
@sonney2k	all 3 errors exactly the same

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: enable tests previously failing on travis
@sonney2k	wiking, for python2 too?
@sonney2k	wiking, I've checked some osx errors btw and they are all fishy as in numpy matrices having inf at some place and our a-b > eps tolerance test (naturally) failing
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah in python2 there was some time when this error
@wiking	happened
@wiking	dunno when exactly it disappeared
@sonney2k	wiking, I've never seen this before
@sonney2k	would be interested if protocol=3 has the same issue...
@sonney2k	or =0
@sonney2k	wiking, btw I think we should have the d-ptr thing also as gsoc project
@sonney2k	wiking, I don't see that any of us is really starting this otherwise
@sonney2k	wiking, it might be good though that 3 of us are mentors for a student doing it - and it is a nice (easy) entrance task for an ML guy
@wiking	sonney2k: sure thing... can we find a good student for that?
@sonney2k	wiking, why not? I mean it should be somebody who has some ML overview and a bit of C++ - no more
@sonney2k	only problem is that it might be too boring....
@sonney2k	wiking, any idea why the analysis builders are not triggered?

@wiking	but maybe with the new additional builder tasks
@sonney2k	dependent on what? modular?
@wiking	something has been borken
@wiking	*broken
@sonney2k	wiking, it might be sufficient to just run this one nightly
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean all the analysis guys
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	let's hope i made it in an easy way to change this :)
@sonney2k	wiking, from what I've seen you did :)
@sonney2k	at least it was easy for me to add python3 / osx
@wiking	sonney2k: ah ok
@wiking	sonney2k: analysers are dependent on modular
@wiking	and python3 is a modular
@wiking	and that was failing till now
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	ok the only thing with the nightlies
@wiking	that we want a bit of a distribution of these analysers
@wiking	as they are quite demanding :P
@sonney2k	wiking, well then limit them to go 1 by 1
@sonney2k	but nightly should be sufficient
