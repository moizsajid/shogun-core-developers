@iglesiasg	good morning people
@iglesiasg	hey sonney2k, you there?
@iglesiasg	ahh it is work time maybe
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, ^
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: hey
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I made a few updates to the webpage here and there
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I am planning to fix next the part documentation/developer
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, also, I have seen that the bar with the images in the bottom of the home page http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, is sort of broken
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, IIRC you added this, so probably you know already where to touch in the code to fix it. Can you fix that or do you prefer me to take care of that?
@iglesiasg	with broken I mean that the arrow links to the right and left don't work
@iglesiasg	neither do the circles in the middle part below the images
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: oops that used to work
 sonne|work	I guess I broke that then somehow
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I updated to jquery 1.10 I guess tahts why
@iglesiasg	I see
@iglesiasg	you handle that then ;)
@iglesiasg	all right, I'll be back soon

@HeikoS	sonney2k: around?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: !
@HeikoS	hi
 lisitsyn	hey
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it looks we are not in state to release right?
 lisitsyn	what should we do about it?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good question :)
@HeikoS	I dont know, maybe release anyway?
@HeikoS	or make a list of urgent things
@HeikoS	problem is I cant do anything currently
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: or release RC
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah I am in same troubles now too
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah but that would kind of soften the big bang we are aiming
@HeikoS	for
@HeikoS	and the thing is, we dont need an RC, we know what to fix
@HeikoS	so rather fix it an drelease then
 lisitsyn	we have a few problems infrastructure wise
 lisitsyn	like demos whatever
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: are you already preparing for the flight?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no, I am doing coursework ;)
 lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	this will be over early next year
@HeikoS	until then, I wont do anything unfortunately
@HeikoS	apart from writing a few mail
@HeikoS	maybe we should aim for a list of critical things?
@HeikoS	the rest can go 3.1
@HeikoS	we just need to publish the gsoc stuff basically
@HeikoS	so only that + notebook shave to work
@HeikoS	gotta go, see you
