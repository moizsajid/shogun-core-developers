 wiking	:>
 wiking	mena i mena
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	wiking: so really, what did you want to change with typename?
 wiking	lol man
 wiking	i just wrote a how to code email
 wiking	to shogun
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah adding an inplace new helps

 wiking	wtf
 wiking	are we cblas support list?
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	I don't mind to share
 blackburn	wiking: that's actually cool to share useless things I know :D
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	wiking: I have a question for ya
 blackburn	wiking: I have quite a few loose coupled source files in there: https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/tree/master/tapkee
 blackburn	like routines folder
 blackburn	but here I use things I defined in tapkee_defines.hpp
 blackburn	so going from the top to the bottom it works and compiles ok
 blackburn	but when I have say https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/tapkee/routines/matrix_operations.hpp
 blackburn	where defines file is not included
 blackburn	it is not really consistent
 blackburn	but including defines there again is confusing for me
 blackburn	so there is a loop - it makes no troubles yet but it is ugly
 blackburn	what do you think?
 wiking	just a sec

 blackburn	sonney2k: did that help?
 blackburn	and wtf did you glance over all code
 blackburn	:D

-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 63d4f32 Soeren Sonnenburg: remove debug printf's
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes it works now
@sonney2k	blackburn, the issue is that from w/i memory.h I needed to include SGVector.h
@sonney2k	that is causing severe pain
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	so basically I had to move everything to .cpp files as much as possible
@sonney2k	but we should do this anyways
@sonney2k	I will try if I can get forward decl. to work for SGVector in memory now...
@sonney2k	http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Nov/94
@sonney2k	uhoh
@sonney2k	lets up there will be a fix soon ...
@sonney2k	btw have you noticed - mloss.org mldata.org etc are down
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I did
@sonney2k	it's being hosted at TU
@sonney2k	but I have absolutely no longer any influence on this...
 blackburn	tu sucks :D
@sonney2k	might be that the department is moving to a new building

@sonney2k	wiking, look some tiny dataset to play with ;) http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/science/for-web-images-creating-new-technology-to-seek-and-find.html?smid=go-share

-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master af103f3 Soeren Sonnenburg: simplify example
 wiking	yeah imagenet
 wiking	it's goodish
 blackburn	sonney2k: we are going to have randomized pca in shougn once I merge things :)
 blackburn	and randomized kpca
 blackburn	and randomized everything but it is really relevant for dense methods like mds, pca and isomap
@sonney2k	we need some huge data for that :)
@sonney2k	btw, blackburn does ./evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl work on your machine?
@sonney2k	I mean will it give valgrind errors
@sonney2k	(with 'old' shogun')
@sonney2k	or wiking ^
 blackburn	I should try
 blackburn	old like before your commit?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	good catch that I didn't update it yet
 blackburn	segfaul
@sonney2k	blackburn, and valgrind?
@sonney2k	what does it say?
@sonney2k	(I assume that example was broken before...)
 blackburn	he said I am an asshole but let me check more careful
 blackburn	a lot of invalid read of size 8
@sonney2k	tell me anything I don't know :P
@sonney2k	a lot of?
 blackburn	yes, hundreds
 blackburn	okay tens
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	==14496== Invalid free() / delete / delete[] / realloc()
@sonney2k	I only have this
 blackburn	that's the last one
@sonney2k	==14496==  Address 0xb723e90 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 16 free'd
@sonney2k	==14496==    at 0x4C27D4E: free (vg_replace_malloc.c:427)

@sonney2k	==14496==    by 0x5210838: shogun::CParseBuffer<double>::~CParseBuffer() (ParseBuffer.h:273)
@sonney2k	blackburn, which shogun version do you have?
 blackburn	1.1.0
@sonney2k	grrg
 blackburn	commit 93dba0dd6313f4faf6e2436b653ce1caf16880e1
 blackburn	I have 'last night shogun'
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is b0rken then anyways
 blackburn	should ich update?
@sonney2k	could you please go back to c9a8772920c07f9b4cd8e29f664918e097f38bab
 shogun-buildbot	build #654 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/654
@sonney2k	strange that the buildbot is happy
 blackburn	it doesn't compile poor sonne
 blackburn	sonney2k: what should I do?
 blackburn	../shogun/lib/memory.h:41:24: error: expected initializer before '<' token
@sonney2k	blackburn, what? that is before my changes
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	well remove that function then
 blackburn	I did what you told me master
@sonney2k	ohh wait
@sonney2k	wrong version
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	<type>
 blackburn	java like
@sonney2k	7866d19a4183ad68e64c0d58fc40992de9ff967e
@sonney2k	yeah java infiltrated me
@sonney2k	I can no longer think clearly
 blackburn	I will wait for ArrayList in your code one day
 blackburn	sonney2k: interview question - what is the difference between Vector and ArrayList?
@sonney2k	no clue
@sonney2k	what is Vector?
 blackburn	thread-safe arraylist
 blackburn	array-list is not thread safe
 blackburn	sonney2k: StringBuffer and StringBuilder may be?
 blackburn	;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, so does 7866d19a4183ad68e64c0d58fc40992de9ff967e compile?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea what StringBuffer is
@sonney2k	but let me gues
@sonney2k	s
 blackburn	it is compiling
@sonney2k	thread safe sb :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: bingo
 blackburn	I have ????-6 machine so please wait
@sonney2k	the number of libs / support classes in java is beyond control
 blackburn	sonney2k: number of features in C++ is beyond human brain capabilities :D
@sonney2k	definitely
@sonney2k	blackburn, stop using templates :D
 blackburn	no it gives me power I never had before
 blackburn	I can fly!
@sonney2k	I realize that when I am coding in java my brain relaxes
@sonney2k	I thought dance...
 blackburn	I realize I shit bricks when I see java code at my job I am leaving
@sonney2k	is there some obfuscated java code contest it could enter?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no typical overbusinessed code
 blackburn	a lot of code
 blackburn	it looks like I am serving iran nuclear programme helping with blas
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	they need all support they can get ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, so any news - did it build ?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	building examples
 blackburn	iran is calling sorry :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, well please check with valgrind too
@sonney2k	./evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl that is
 blackburn	==26493== Invalid free() / delete / delete[] / realloc()
 blackburn	one
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	that is the one I have now too
@sonney2k	then feel free to go update to master
@sonney2k	I can then get sgvector forward decls to work
@sonney2k	:)
@sonney2k	so things will improve
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	so the downside now is that we will have ~100 malloc implementations
@sonney2k	so our .so will grow a bit
@sonney2k	but the upside is that stuff like DynArray will work directly with SGVector*
@sonney2k	and we could even have some better trace mallocs for SGObjects
@sonney2k	I mean listing the objects even with refcount :)
 blackburn	is our .so now 500 mb?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: do yuo understand why clang is so much better than gcc?
 blackburn	I am confused with that thing - gcc has been here for years and it is slow, often fails with vectorization and has unreadable errors
 blackburn	that's a puzzle for me
@sonney2k	102M Nov 20 23:03 shogun/libshogun.so.13.0
@sonney2k	blackburn, what size is yours?
 blackburn	I will not tell you :D
 blackburn	okay wait wait it is compiling
@sonney2k	I knew you have to compensate for sth
@sonney2k	didn't know it is *that* :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is with optimizations enabled + debug symbols
 blackburn	yeah I don't have 102M
 blackburn	meters
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	optimizations enabled + debug yeah
 blackburn	btw without debug it should be much less
 blackburn	tapkee is 20mb when debug is enabled
 blackburn	406kb with no debug info
@sonney2k	when I strip it it is 20mb
@sonney2k	actually
@sonney2k	13
@sonney2k	MB
 blackburn	makes sense
@sonney2k	so shogun == 30 tapkees
 blackburn	yeah 15 pair of slippers
 blackburn	makes sense again
@sonney2k	highheels, boots for whatever weather conditions you encounter
@sonney2k	and occassions
 blackburn	sonney2k: no tapkee is slippers
@sonney2k	blackburn, so is it ~100MB here too?
 blackburn	compiling..
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure just plain slippers
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll name next piece of code I write as borsch may be
@sonney2k	argh kid awake, n8
 blackburn	.a is 220 MB
 blackburn	.so is 98.1 MB
@sonney2k	blackburn, and when you do strip -s on the .so?
 blackburn	12.2 mb
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't know about strip - what does it do?
 blackburn	is it corrupted now?
 blackburn	when I strip tapkee app it becomes 335 kb
@sonney2k	blackburn, no just debug symbols removed
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	alright then good enough
@sonney2k	bed time!
 blackburn	see you
