 blackburn	n4nd0: will you be at barcelona in february? :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: no, I don't think so, why?
 n4nd0	NIPS there?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no some shity conference I hope to go through
 n4nd0	I think I remember that there was going to be a conference taken place there
 blackburn	but I have no paper actually and have only one month
 n4nd0	what's the name of it?
 blackburn	ICPRAM
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we need to talk a bit about release/stabilizing/documentation/nice examples and future involvement at that meeting
 blackburn	I am pretty interested who hates us and do not want to continue and who loves and want to
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	haha
@sonney2k	blackburn,
@sonney2k	hah
@sonney2k	hate love relationship :D
 blackburn	we mostly support binary you know
 blackburn	so I start to think binary too
 n4nd0	blackburn: btw, what is it that should be prepared as a code sample for google?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, bern4rd did some great job with the website btw... I hope I will have some more time to finish it up :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: ah there will be some script around
@sonney2k	n4nd0, don't worry blackburn has some script for that :D
 blackburn	so you just pack everything you've done
 blackburn	would be better if they ask for blood sample
 blackburn	or your foot
 blackburn	no idea how to use code samples
@sonney2k	luckily only foot
@sonney2k	not finger
@sonney2k	otherwise coding gets tough *eg*
 n4nd0	lol
 blackburn	why not? we need you to send us your foot by mail to exhibit you have done something
 blackburn	I found that fair
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: did you know one gsoc student made that to london 2012?
 blackburn	not the foot thingy I mean
 blackburn	iirc he will participate in some 20k wlak
 blackburn	walk
 n4nd0	blackburn: wow coder + professional sportsman/woman
 n4nd0	nice
 blackburn	trevor barron is the name
 blackburn	moreover he has some illness - I'd say that's how one live
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen FREAK descriptor thing?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	did you ever try?
 blackburn	I am going to
@sonney2k	blackburn, I meant olympics...
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, FREAK - no
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so you do you love or hate us :D
@sonney2k	... or do you need a real valued output :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am curious whether one can use one of string kernels to compare freaks
@sonney2k	-inf ... +inf :D
 blackburn	cause it is binary string
@sonney2k	probably - but these may not look for the right patterns...
 blackburn	sonney2k: well everyone uses hamming
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I want to continue, sure
 n4nd0	I plan to do CRFs
 n4nd0	for the moment :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, at least the weighted degree kernel does too
 blackburn	sonney2k: does what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, lets send lots of love or rose ponies to n4nd0
 blackburn	sonney2k: we've exchanged postcards btw
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but I will need some backup support for theory aspects and such
 n4nd0	I don't know if Nico or any other will be somewhat available for it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: best way is to collaborate on research
 blackburn	then he will have time for you :)
 n4nd0	I understand
 blackburn	that's how I bother ckwidmer_
 n4nd0	I just need a bit of guidance, as long as a I am not completely alone, it will be ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: I did help georg zeller with some data two weeks ago btw
 blackburn	we are all the big family :D
 n4nd0	I have really enjoyed receiving help from Georg
@sonney2k	n4nd0, georg and nico continue research on that subject - so they will certainly help
@sonney2k	ahh and if you get COFFIN into SO then that might even be a paper...
 n4nd0	he have had a couple of dicussions on skype, he made lot of useful comments
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that sounds interesting
 n4nd0	blackburn: I count on you for that too, right?
 blackburn	I am in in everything
 n4nd0	:)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, http://memegenerator.net/instance/24349213?browsingOrder=New&browsingTimeSpan=Today
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thank you :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, big question is how we get shogun ready for release
 blackburn	hardly hard
@sonney2k	and I mean stable :D
 blackburn	recalling that m$ advertisement
 blackburn	we are in pretty soft state
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am a hard guy you know ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: good for ya :)

 pluskid	blackburn: around?
 blackburn	pluskid: yeah
 pluskid	blackburn: how do we paste code in shogun-tutorial with syntax highlighting?
 blackburn	hmm
 pluskid	personally, I like the minted package: http://code.google.com/p/minted/
 pluskid	but it requires pygments (an external python package)
 pluskid	and you need to pass -shell-escape to latex when compiling
 pluskid	it use external program to render the coloring
 blackburn	heiko: what do you  think?
 blackburn	I don't mind to use it
 pluskid	the result looks beautiful but slows down the compile time a little
 blackburn	the other alternative is listings
 heiko	pluskid is it hard to install?
 pluskid	blackburn: I'm using it for some of my other docs, but I'm not sure other authors are wish to install pygments for this
 heiko	The thing is: do we really need code in the tutorial?
 heiko	wouldnt well documented examples be better?
 pluskid	heiko: if there's no code, then what is tutorial for?
 heiko	for explaining concepts
 heiko	And refering to examples
 pluskid	heiko: I thought shogun-tutor is for explaining concepts *within shogun* ?
 heiko	But actually, you are right, one could add examples in the tutorial that one explains a bit deepter
 pluskid	heiko: "referring to examples" means to examples/undocumented/ directory?
 heiko	yeah, I mean there should be a larger example of all things that one can do, and one could describe them in the tutorial from a greater distance, but the comments in the sourcecode are also  important for this
 heiko	but as said, I agree that code snippets are a good thing in the tutorial
 blackburn	probably we would need
 blackburn	snippets
 blackburn	for describing some concepts
 pluskid	heiko: btw, it requires pygments (usually can be installed with easy_install Pygments), and the package it self involves copying the code to some texmf dir I guess (not sure since I use my system package manager to install it)
 blackburn	like multiclass machines and etc
 heiko	ok, well then its fine for me
 blackburn	heiko: pygments is in ubuntu repo so no need to use easy_install
 heiko	we should have a live version of the pdf online anyway
 heiko	(for people that dont like to install this stuff)
 pluskid	heiko: good idea
 pluskid	heiko: but where to put it and how to keep it sync-ed ?
 heiko	pluskid, just make the buildbot compile it everytime its updated and then have a link to the latest pdf
 heiko	just like the shogun doxygen
 pluskid	heiko: OK, I see
 heiko	pluskid, could you add some example on how to use this highlighting?
 pluskid	heiko: yes, I'm writing the multiclass part, I'll make a PR later today with some examples
 heiko	cool
@sonney2k	pluskid, heiko - I would suggest to put examples only in the examples folder and then have some magic to insert these examples directly in the doc
@sonney2k	if it is only short snippets of code
@sonney2k	then things are different of course
@sonney2k	(not full examples)
@sonney2k	thunderstorm again!
 pluskid	sonney2k: I'm trying to use a full example and explain part by part in the tutorial, any suggestion for this?
@sonney2k	pluskid, I tried the same in shogun doc on the website...
@sonney2k	it partially includes examples from shogun/examples
@sonney2k	and partially not
@sonney2k	no idea how to do it better
 pluskid	hmm
@sonney2k	problem with external tutorial is that it is likely to become outdated if not regularly updated
 pluskid	external?
@sonney2k	uricamic, please fix the warning in http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/235/steps/compile/logs/stdio
 pluskid	internal tutorial will also get out-dated
@sonney2k	pluskid, not in code
 pluskid	oh, get it
@sonney2k	pluskid, that is why we use doxygen and shogun/examples
@sonney2k	this requires just the author of the code to update stuff and the buildbot will tell us about any breakage / errors
@sonney2k	that is a problem in the tutorial
 pluskid	sonney2k: I thought (and I guess this is also Cheng's idea) shogun/examples are mainly simple test cases to let buildbot to check the code
@sonney2k	machine learning 'theory' is luckily not affected :D
@sonney2k	pluskid, nope
@sonney2k	these are examples showing how to minimally use a certain machine
@sonney2k	but they return some objects at the end such that we can use them for regression tests too
@sonney2k	(checking if results stay the same over versions)
 pluskid	sonney2k: Cheng suggest that tutorial code work on some real world examples (like USPS), I don't think it will be afardable for build-bot to constantly run those examples, isn't it?
@sonney2k	we cannot run it on every commit - maybe weekly or sth
@sonney2k	pluskid, we even have shogun/applications
@sonney2k	and already that gets outdated (because not run in tests...)
 pluskid	oh
 pluskid	I see
 pluskid	history is a good lesson
@sonney2k	I guess if we had 100 developers then things might be better
@sonney2k	...or more chaotic :D
 pluskid	then you'll have no time with your kids any more :D
 pluskid	OK, then hope the build-bot for tutorial code could be set up soon
 pluskid	brb

 gsomix	yep, over 42 hours
 gsomix	in cool train w/o air conditioning
 blackburn	sonney2k: you said your deutchebahns suck?
@sonney2k	blackburn, we sometimes have air con
@sonney2k	but for sure no windows to open
@sonney2k	so if it is 30 C outside - pray!
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have to stay for 7 hours in a city for no reason?
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	chelyabinsk - st.petersburg train does it
@sonney2k	blackburn, in germany that is not necessary - we just walk home ;-)
 pluskid	I once was on a train for 33 hours (without a ticket for seat) with people all around
 blackburn	what a bad boy
 pluskid	I got on that train through the window actually

 blackburn	pluskid: doesn't it lead to execution in china? :D
@sonney2k	pluskid, you would have to ride on the roof of the ICE
@sonney2k	(in germany)
@sonney2k	but if it runs 250km/h you certainly don't need to worry about air con :D
 pluskid	blackburn: no, you can get on the train and then buy a ticket (a ticket without a seat of course), especially at the crowd time
 blackburn	I see
 pluskid	there're soooooooooooo many people
 pluskid	it's a nightmare to buy ticket for summer/winter holiday
@sonney2k	I can imagine
@sonney2k	people already complain here
 pluskid	I once queued outside for 12 hours overnight for a ticket.
 blackburn	I bet small city in china is a city with 'only' 2 millions of people
 pluskid	blackburn: haha, I have no sense of numbers
@sonney2k	blackburn, almost like the capital of germany :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I thought it is sth like 5M..
@sonney2k	blackburn, same order of magnitude :D
 blackburn	hmm 3.5
 blackburn	pretty small
 pluskid	all of my friends who has been abroad would say: " there's almost no one in the street there" :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, buildbot fails due to not having proper ifdef have_eigen3 stuff
@sonney2k	the class is not known
 blackburn	sonney2k: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	pluskid, when visiting china only hope would be that chinese live in the 1.60-1.70m height so I can breathe fresh air above them :D
 blackburn	hmm interesting
 pluskid	sonney2k: sure :D
 blackburn	I can't :(
 gsomix	blackburn, oh no, I always remember pic with Sasha Gray and title "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED"
 blackburn	gsomix: like pics with sasha grey?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am having a strange issue with eigen3
@sonney2k	CFITCInferenceMethod is unknown if eigen3 is not available
 blackburn	it produces a lot of warnings when included via -I flag
@sonney2k	and our class list detects it
 blackburn	why does it detect it then?
@sonney2k	so either we make some empty class available
 gsomix	blackburn, ooops, Grey, of course
 gsomix	^^'
 pluskid	btw: is the meeting in half an hour or actually tomorrow?
@sonney2k	gsomix, taht thing http://beerandstupidity.blogspot.de/2011/07/challenge-accepted.html

@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	eigen has lots of shadowed variables
 blackburn	sonney2k: they go away when I include eigen3/Eigen/Dense
 blackburn	instead of Eigen/Dense
 blackburn	I do not understand why
@sonney2k	blackburn, I once got bitten by a variable naming clash (shadowed variable) ... was hunting that bug for quite a while. since then this warning is turned on
@sonney2k	blackburn, do we get other warnings from eigen
@sonney2k	would the eigen people 'fix' that?
@sonney2k	or should we disable this warning again...
 blackburn	sonney2k: but why it goes away with different way of include?

 puffin444	hello
@sonney2k	heiko, will arthur join?
 ckwidmer	hi all
@sonney2k	n4nd0, how much time do you have at the airport?
 heiko	sonney2k, unfortunately I have no response so far, sent a text and an email, I feel bad that this always happens since we talk every few days, but I cannot do anything about it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think the boarding will start in about 1h20min
 n4nd0	so as long as the connection holds, I think I can make it for the whole meeting
@sonney2k	wiking, what about alex?
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, there
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	then lets just start
@sonney2k	Welcome everyone to our 4th meeting. In the last weeks we have seen various PRs from everybody and things have been progressing nicely.
@sonney2k	That said, the program is coming to an end rather soon.
@sonney2k	We are very proud what you all have achieved and naturally want to keep you as contributors (maybe even becoming core developers like blackburn/heiko) after GSoC.
@sonney2k	(it would be blackburns part here to say yes yes yes we want you)
 n4nd0	:)
@sonney2k	for some reason he got disconnected few minutes ago
@sonney2k	so heiko you have to take over this part :D
 heiko	lol :)
 heiko	yes yes yes we want you,
 heiko	join the team, its great fun!
@sonney2k	we all know real live will take over after gsoc
@sonney2k	so one cannot commit a lot of time but just occassionally
 heiko	its pretty cool seeing that your stuff is being used
 heiko	and that usually takes some time, so stay, stay! :D
@sonney2k	heiko did that last year and eventually became a core developer
@sonney2k	(we cannot mention this often enough)
@sonney2k	For sure we want to have all of your code in the upcoming shogun 2.0 release.
@sonney2k	However, to be able to do a release we need to shift focus from features to stability, documentation and examples.
@sonney2k	So please *everyone* help us to get the buildbot to build on all archs with close to 0 warnings and create nice examples (graphical too) such that we can illustrate the work you did.
 heiko	and btw it opens a lot of doors in uni when you work on an open-source project
@sonney2k	ideally you use shogun to do baseline experiments and then from time to time contribute some extensions
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@109.226.80.43] has joined #shogun
 heiko	sonney2k, it would be great if we could sort out the testing-branch issues in order to maybe have some tests for the release
@sonney2k	that works well in academia and even industry
 shogun-buildbot_	build #247 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/247  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 wiking	heiko: second that... i think we should discuss it today on the meeting to have a consensus about that
 n4nd0	haha that was very appropriate from shogun-buildbot_
@sonney2k	heiko, wiking ok noted down
 pluskid	buildbot wants to join the meeting
@sonney2k	pluskid, yeah it complains about my merge of puffin444's code :D
 blackburn	ehm my connection sucks
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	Mentors - again who wants to go to mountain view on Oct 20/21 to join the mentors summit? That event is a good place to get to know core developers from other organisations (like swig, orange, opencv, ...).
 blackburn	ckwidmer wants I am sure :)
 ckwidmer	sonney2k, same as last time: interested, but let others go if anyone else wants to
 shogun-buildbot_	build #205 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/205  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 blackburn	ckwidmer: it should be easier for you this time hehe
 ckwidmer	blackburn yes, true :)
 heiko	sonney2k, no students allowed there right?
@sonney2k	heiko, exactly
 n4nd0	:(
@sonney2k	only mentors
@sonney2k	become a mentor next year and you two can go :D
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, I guess it will be us two then
 ckwidmer	heiko, mentors get paid in cool rather than money ;)
 ckwidmer	sonney2k, I'm not complaining :)
 heiko	ckwidmer, yeah :)
@sonney2k	Now as usual, please every mentor/student team - give us a status update, telling us what you did since the last meeting, whether you are behind or on schedule and what has already been merged into shogun and what will be the final steps.
 blackburn	ckwidmer: sonney2k said he is a hard boy so be careful
 ckwidmer	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is not the first time I share a room with ckwidmer - so he knows pretty well ;-)
 blackburn	I don't want to know what happened last time!
 blackburn	:D
 ckwidmer	yes, sonney2k snores
 heiko	lol :)
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, that is how I code at night!
@sonney2k	so who wants to start?
 ckwidmer	heh
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, blackburn you?
 blackburn	why not
 ckwidmer	sonney2k, sure
 blackburn	okay what we've done
 ckwidmer	blackburn, fire away
 blackburn	I did not prepare the speech lol
 blackburn	there are a few multitask algorithms available now
@sonney2k	maybe n4nd0 next and then vojtech/uricamic
 blackburn	some time was spent on making it work with xval
 ckwidmer	blackburn, just make a rap video from your commits and upload them to youtube
 blackburn	we actually use these algos to predict on ovarian cancer data
 blackburn	namely, algorithms are L1/Lq task tree/group logistic regression/least squares regression
 blackburn	L1/L2 following argyriou probably popular thing
 blackburn	trace norm regularized logistic regression and clustered multitask logistic regression
 blackburn	SLEP-based algorithms do not support xval yet but it is on the way
 blackburn	moreover I am working on kernel mean matching now
 blackburn	that's something from domain adaptation I want to implement
@sonney2k	blackburn, so what do you want to have in shogun 2.0?
 ckwidmer	so seems like we have most of the popular MTL methods (non deep learning) stuff in shogun now, which is really nice
@sonney2k	(and what you would like to do after?)
 blackburn	sonney2k: after gsoc I will get back to edrt and made yet another attempt
 blackburn	as for MTL
 blackburn	well I hope ckwidmer will catch me on the train so we will continue to play around with data
 blackburn	so if something cool appears I can extend MTL part
 blackburn	actually MTL is not so useless sonney2k
 blackburn	it appears to be best classifier on the data we work on now
 ckwidmer	blackburn, never give up hope ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, ckwidmer alright thanks - so what is missing then is documentaion / examples mostly right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I actually want to polish these things because they are not user-friendly yet
 blackburn	yes, doc, examples and safety
 ckwidmer	the good thing is, quite a bunch of ppl here at MSK get interested in this stuff, when realizing that their data set could benefit from these methods
 blackburn	if you pass something wrong it could kaboom
@sonney2k	recall that we at least intended to release Sept 1.
 ckwidmer	will help us to polish
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, users are the best testers o_O
 ckwidmer	:)
 ckwidmer	they will complain
@sonney2k	alright thanks
@sonney2k	I think we have to continue
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please?
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	I implemented the HM-SVM based on the hmsvm toolbox. I have compared the model learnt
 n4nd0	by my implementation with the one in the toolbox and the results are correct. However, it
 n4nd0	just works with discrete data and I am currently working on a extension to handle
 n4nd0	real data for the observations using PLiFs.
 n4nd0	After this I will focus on improve the documentation and the examples.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so plifs will still be done in gsoc and doc / example right?
@sonney2k	gsoc timeframe
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	right now the plifs are taking a bit more time because I am trying to use what it is already in SHOGUN
@sonney2k	and in case you stick around (which is what we all hope) coffin, etc
 n4nd0	exactly
-!- alexlovesdata [6d2d0040@gateway/web/freenode/ip.109.45.0.64] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 n4nd0	Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement conditional random fields. This part was included on the initial schedule.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok thanks - questions to that anyone
 blackburn	actually KMM would work with SO too
 blackburn	so we can have domain adaptation structured output learning
@sonney2k	blackburn, hehe post shogun 2.0
 blackburn	a few more words and it would sound like something cool
 wiking	n4nd0: i'd like to have some changes in SO for supporting COFFIN fw. i dont know whether we should discuss it now or later...?
 n4nd0	wiking: this will be something to do after gsoc
@sonney2k	wiking, n4nd0 after the meeting I guess
 wiking	sonney2k n4nd0 ok
 n4nd0	wiking: but we can discuss about it at any moment :)
 wiking	n4nd0: hehe yeah let's do it after as that is what i need as well in latent... anyways after the meeting then if u have time
@sonney2k	alright next uricamic/vojtech?
 vojtech	ok
 uricamic	ok
 vojtech	he work Michal did since the last meeting:
 vojtech	i. He implemented better cutting plane management for both BMRM and BM.  ii. He implemented our variant of Bundle Method for risk minimization.  iii. Finally, he has been implementing multiple-cutting plane model improvement (similar to n-slack of Joachims).   He will finish in 3-4 days. And that's it. The final steps: to collect some nice benchmarks for StructSVM, testing, documentation, examples.
 vojtech	sorry for the bad formating
@sonney2k	vojtech, ok nice - I think we really need some nice/cool example for that otherwise people won't know that this is actually cool stuff
 vojtech	I agree
@sonney2k	n4nd0, blackburn holds for you too
 n4nd0	uricamic, vojtech : I got a question here
 vojtech	go ahead
 uricamic	so far I have just the multiclass example, I have tried and compared to matlab implementation on MNIST data
@sonney2k	vojtech, uricamic any chance of continuing afterwards doing libqp business (exctracting things like pr loqo etc)?
 n4nd0	could I use the models I have worked in my project, the HMSVMModel or the MulticlassModel, with one of your algorithms directly?
 wiking	n4nd0: you need a risk function...
-!- alexlovesdata [~binder@goldenezahl.ml.tu-berlin.de] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	wiking: aham, I see
 blackburn	ah btw vojtech I patched libqp_gsmo a little
 blackburn	may be you would want to push it into your version
 vojtech	sonney2k: I'm continously improving LIBQP and LIBOCAS if there is a substantial motivation, e.g. recently I added positivity constraint to LIBOCAS which was requested by some computer vision people
 uricamic	 n4nd0 yes, but you have to create the RiskFunction for that, anyway in that function it should be possible to use your stuff
 wiking	vojtech: oh that's great news! i'm looking forward to use that extension in latent methods ;)
 n4nd0	uricamic: nice, thank you!
 uricamic	but you have to wait for the next PR, where I will add support for user data
 vojtech	blackburn, thanks I'll look at it
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, could you please continue to lead the meeting
 n4nd0	uricamic: ok
@sonney2k	(my kids just woke up...)
 ckwidmer	sure
 vojtech	wiking: you can already downloaded
 ckwidmer	I guess I have to wake up, too then (around 7AM) ;)
 wiking	uricamic: remember the chat we had 2 weeks ago, i'll give u some changes i've done to your code to support latent variable in bmrm_data_t
 vojtech	wiking: http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~xfrancv/ocas/html/index.html
 wiking	vojtech: ok i'll then try to merge the code into shogun!
 blackburn	vojtech: basically one needs to initialize solution that doesn't violate \sum constraint
 cheng	ckwidmer: I had to cut my Friday beers short. ;-)
 wiking	blackburn: we can do that straight away right?
 blackburn	wiking: what?
 ckwidmer	cheng haha. Ill probably fall asleep in mine
 uricamic	wiking: yep, I remember and I am almost finished with new design to support whatever user data you want
 wiking	blackburn: just take the new release of libocas and update the code in shogun
 wiking	uricamic: great let's see how our two ways collide ;)
 blackburn	wiking: sure why not just push everything
 wiking	blackburn: okie
 ckwidmer	ok
 blackburn	who's next?
 ckwidmer	who wants to go next?
 wiking	i can go
 wiking	i mean alexlovesdata and me
 ckwidmer	ok
 wiking	if that's ok
 ckwidmer	wikiing, sure go ahead
 wiking	ok so basically 2 things happened ever since the last meeting
 uricamic	wiking: but anyways I would like to see your version supporting latend variables, maybe then I will modify the current version to meet better you requirements
 wiking	a) most importantly latent implementations has been PR-ed and merged into shogun master branch. that includes LatentSVM and a preliminary LatentSOSVM. i've added a very simple example but we've agreed with alexlovesdata that we should do a more complex and nicer example
 ckwidmer	(the others can maybe start preparing some short summary)
 wiking	thus i'm currently working on finishing a full blown example for latentSVM and LatentSOSVM based on image-net data
 wiking	basically it'll be a computer vision based problem and i think that'll be a very nice example of how to use these two methods and what are they capable of
 wiking	what is still missing is to finish this example and add modular interface for both of the classifiers
 wiking	and that i add support for bmrm based LatentSOSVM
 blackburn	wiking: I've been studying freak a little
 wiking	b) with heiko i've created a unit testing branch on my repo to add unit testing for the c++ code in shogun because we both thought that it would be great to have it for shogun
 alexlovesdata	and I owe you still the Hog code viking ;)
 blackburn	it seems that it could be a good example of latent model
 blackburn	should pretty fast actually I mean
 wiking	currently the PR for that attempt is at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/667
 ckwidmer	wiking, ok thank you
 wiking	thank you very much for all the comments
 wiking	BUT
@sonney2k	vojtech, I would very much prefer to have all the qp solver stuff in your libqp and only use that from shogun via some standard interface - then we can (from shogun) just switch solvers on the fly for any of the chunking svms etc
 wiking	ckwidmer: just as a last thing!
 ckwidmer	wiking, sure
 wiking	so i think
 heiko	blackburn, sonney2k, could you have a look on the current approach so that we can decide how to proceed with the testing today?
 wiking	that we should really discuss how to proceed with the unit testing
 wiking	because it's there i've added examples for both simple unit testing and mocking
 blackburn	let me check
 vojtech	sonney2k: ok, I have increased the priority counter for LIBQP by one
 wiking	now we should really try to agree on how to add this into shogun
 wiking	before the 2.0 release
 wiking	naturally i want to add both latentSVM and latentSOSVM into 2.0 release of shogun
 wiking	and i'm comfident that that will happen
 wiking	i'm more 'concerned' about the unit testing
 blackburn	one problem I see
 wiking	since that should be done by all of us together
 wiking	;)
 wiking	and yeas
@sonney2k	wiking, sure we do that as submodule :)
 wiking	i've forgot
 blackburn	we wouldn't be able to complete all the tests
 blackburn	before release
 heiko	blackburn, but this is incremental
 wiking	sonney2k: i've given my reasons why i think submoduling will be really bad for the whole concept of unit testing
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is not a problem
@sonney2k	wiking, why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: wiking: yes, submoduling can be a problem
 heiko	so, it can be included in the release
 blackburn	because they are not synchronized
@sonney2k	they are
 wiking	sonney2k: "my concern is here more about the whole method of how to add new code + corresponding unit tests.
 wiking	that's going to be at least 2 commits + 2 pushes and one extra pulls to get in sync with the submodule..."
@sonney2k	thats true
@sonney2k	though I don't see a problem with that
 wiking	and yeah we've try to use shogun with blackburn on a large scale image categorisation challenge
 wiking	it's part of this years Pascal VOC
@sonney2k	I think we need to postpone the discussion until after this meeting though
 wiking	so if u feel like joining the team of shogun in this
 wiking	please come and contribute because we need you!
 blackburn	wiking: yeah we need to start some progresson that
 wiking	blackburn: indeed :)
 heiko	wiking, what are deadlines and prices? :)
 alexlovesdata	OMG, viking you should have told me about pascal VOC
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: why?
 wiking	alexlovesdata: now i'm saying it ;)
 alexlovesdata	I won last years imageclef photoannotation
 alexlovesdata	I have good features
 wiking	alexlovesdata: :D then come and join us :)
 alexlovesdata	I only lack disk space
 blackburn	hah
 wiking	alexlovesdata: i have that :)
 wiking	alexlovesdata: 7 TB
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: wiking has a lot of
 wiking	if that's enough
 wiking	sonney2k: okey
 alexlovesdata	great .... we should talk after the meeting about pascal voc ;)
 ckwidmer	hehe, ok
 wiking	so please everybody stick around if u can for a max 10 mins
 ckwidmer	seems like sonney2k is back
 wiking	to join the conversation about unit testing
 blackburn	pluskid: cheng may be you next?
 ckwidmer	I would suggest finishing up the reports first
 pluskid	ok, shall I go?
@sonney2k	alright cheng / pluskid want to contiue?
@sonney2k	heh
 ckwidmer	but it's fine to discuss unit tests after that
 cheng	I volunteer pluskid to type... ;-)
 pluskid	I implemented the RelaxedTree algorithm. It tooks a bit longer than expected due to my under-estimate of the complexity of its colorization algorithm. But I finally get it hunted. Before the end of GSoC, I'm planning to add content to the shogun-tutorial of multiclass learning and implement an algorithm from "Gun".
@sonney2k	(and after that puffin444 and gsomix)
 pluskid	and that's it :)
@sonney2k	pluskid, considering the number of algorithms you contributed you will get lots of users
 cheng	Just a comment here that Gunnar's algorithm is basically cutting planes. Hopefully some of the other members can help.
@sonney2k	pluskid, dont' forget about examples (graphical if possible)
 pluskid	sonney2k: OK, maybe we could include some nice figures in shogun-tutor
@sonney2k	otherwise people have no idea how to use all that stuff
 blackburn	cheng: pluskid: I can actually prepare a script for road sign recognition stuff
@sonney2k	and more importantly what you can do with all that
 blackburn	there you can measure performance
 cheng	blackburn: That's a cool app.
 pluskid	blackburn: cool, thanks!
@sonney2k	pluskid, if you beat blackburn on that task he will cry for at least 1 hour :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I won't :)
 blackburn	I don't care now
 cheng	blackburn: if we get it fast enough, I know some people here who want to do it real time.
 pluskid	lol
@sonney2k	cheng, blackburn has it fast enough
@sonney2k	(linear svm...)
@sonney2k	with coffin
@sonney2k	anyways more comments to pluskid/cheng?
@sonney2k	if not then thanks pluskid - as usual excellent work
@sonney2k	puffin444, want to continue?
 cheng	blackburn: http://www.nicta.com.au/research/projects/AutoMap/sign_geo-positioning_service
 blackburn	I am curious whether these cool algoritmhs would beat crammer-singer
 puffin444	sure
 pluskid	btw: is cutting plane related to bundle method?
 pluskid	I'm totally ignorance of those
 blackburn	cheng: what's technology of recognition?
@sonney2k	pluskid, yes - vojtech is the ueberexpert here
 pluskid	sonney2k: ok
 cheng	blackburn: No idea, coz I'm not involved.
 puffin444	A lot has happened in the last month. I had to focus
 pluskid	but I'm afraid I don't even know what to ask now (before making some preliminary reading)
 blackburn	cheng: I used HOG + homogeneous kernel map + linear svm
@sonney2k	puffin444, please continue
 blackburn	cheng: 97.82% on http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=results
 blackburn	would be interesting to see better results with pluskid's new algos
 puffin444	on alot of extra work in the model selection framework to support gradient selection. added also were some ARD kenels, sparse approximtion and a simple visual demo
 puffin444	sorry about that
 cheng	blackburn: pluskid: Definitely a cool application demo for multiclass.
 pluskid	sure!
 puffin444	As of now all but one feature in the schedule has bee merged.
@sonney2k	puffin444, so what do you still want to do for shogun 2.0?
 puffin444	In the coming days I plan to add laplacian aproimation for inference
 blackburn	and the main question puffin444 would you like to continue? ;)
 puffin444	as wel as add documentation
@sonney2k	heiko, see - blackburn is back :D
 heiko	sonney2k, yeah
 heiko	go blackburn, go! :)
 puffin444	and somemore complex examples
 blackburn	heiko: sonney2k: where I am back to?
@sonney2k	puffin444, graphical too if possible
 heiko	blackburn, in recruiting new people :D
@sonney2k	I need nice figures somehow produced with the aid of shogun
 blackburn	it sounds like you had a secret conversation about my recruiting skills :D
 puffin444	absolutely. sorry for the typing speed. it looslie talets are a horrible idea for irc
@sonney2k	puffin444, ohh ok
 heiko	blackburn, these and other skills ;)
@sonney2k	puffin444, great job!
 blackburn	puffin444: where did you get your 86 kg notebook?
@sonney2k	so gsomix - please continue
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok
 puffin444	directly From hp 4 years go
 gsomix	Since last meeting I and sonney2k managed to add python protocol's stuff in our swig code.
 blackburn	puffin444: sorry I mean where it is now :)
@sonney2k	puffin444, I guess oliver has some nice examples (graphical too) - so please ask him - maybe you can easily port things over
 gsomix	sorry, copy-past :]
 gsomix	We have implemented many cool features for DenseFeatures: buffer protocol for really fast memory transactions with numpy objects and for numeric operators (a=mycoolfeatures+numpy.array); mapping and sequence protocol for numpy like slicing (e.g. mycoolfeatures[ : , some_Idx ] = some_const); numeric protocol with using buffer protocol for fast numeric inplace operators (mycoolfeatures+=numpy.array).
 gsomix	At now I'm working on methods for zero-memory-copy working with numpy.array and protocols for Labels, SGVecotr, SGMatrix (last two for 'director classes' stuff). Next I plan work on typemaps for modelselection (hi, heiko) and nice error messages. Btw I need clean up my code and add python3 support.
 gsomix	After GSoC I plan further work with modular interfaces: more director classes, 'protocoled' classes, typemaps and examples...
@sonney2k	not me - all gsomix's work
 puffin444	yes he has given some great exampes
 gsomix	and I want work in shogun because there is blackburn (mimimi, =***)
 gsomix	that's all
 heiko	hi gsomix :)
@sonney2k	cheng, that is sth you would like
@sonney2k	^
 blackburn	no optics though in shogun
 blackburn	and NEVER will be
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	you can do x + y now (x shogun RealFeatures, y numpy array)
 blackburn	ckwidmer must like it too
@sonney2k	slicing all that works and modifiactaions too
@sonney2k	ckwidmer, too yes
 blackburn	real pythonista
 ckwidmer	:)
 cheng	sonney2k: excellent! I don't know how to program in any real language anymore...
@sonney2k	and the no longer copying memory around for python too
 gsomix	btw, I need to go. heiko, when will I be able to discuss with your about typemaps and modelselection? I'll available after 5 August.
@sonney2k	heiko - you should give gsomix a lecture how to create the parameter / model seection tree
 pluskid	can I just use numpy array in place of where RealFeatures are expected?
 gsomix	*will be available
 blackburn	pluskid: no not yet
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	pluskid, but the other way round!
 gsomix	*when you will be able to
 gsomix	awww :)
 heiko	gsomix, ok
@sonney2k	pluskid, so you could use e.g. PyML or mlpy or whatever python toolbox and interact !
 pluskid	ok
 heiko	gsomix, anytime that fits you
 gsomix	heiko, thanks! :)
@sonney2k	alright thanks gsomix
 gsomix	sonney2k, heiko ok, should to go, soryy
 blackburn	sonney2k: I actually think we could add apply(SGMatrix)
 blackburn	and train(SGMatrix)
 heiko	gsomix, ok bye, just ping me
@sonney2k	now please some homework - send me nice figures produced with the aid of shogun
@sonney2k	for the new homepage
@sonney2k	(next week please)
@sonney2k	and then finally when shall we have our last celebration - August 16 11 UTC?
@sonney2k	we will then see how many warnings are left on the buildbot
 heiko	sonney2k, any interest on whats happening with the statistics-framework?
@sonney2k	heiko, oops
@sonney2k	sorry
@sonney2k	heiko, please continue
 heiko	no worries :)
 blackburn	lol
 heiko	wont take long since copy/paste
 blackburn	nobody likes statistics
 heiko	Since last time, I implemented dependence tests using the HSIC. As for the two-sample tests these come in multiple flavours (null-distribution approximations).
 heiko	I did some refactoring/making things more effective for bootstrapping using precomputed kernel matrices (very important for some tests, since these are computed ~250 times)
@sonney2k	blackburn, no no
 heiko	HSIC tests are done -- with examples (graphical ones to come)
* sonney2k *loves* statistics
 heiko	blackburn, but everybody like statistics with kernels :D
 heiko	For synthetical example data, I added a data generator class (please use it everybody!), that makes artificial data available from all interfaces.
@sonney2k	(blackburn - I had to say that to keep heiko as core dev)
 heiko	A cool thing that I added for linear time two-sample tests (based on MMD) is automatic kernel weight selection in an MKL style, using libqp (thanks for that vojtech) (see NIPS paper to come, currently working on review-reply experiments with Arthur)
 heiko	Apart from that, I wrote the MMD part of the tutorial. This has to be completed with HSIC and some practical stuff.
 heiko	Plans for next weeks: adding streaming feature class to linear time MMD, and then polish: tutorial/documentation/examples, and tests (hopefully in the new framework by wiking)
 heiko	I have some more ideas what could be done, but I think I focus on getting things stable/nicely looking now.
 heiko	[end]
 blackburn	I actually like some things from statistics
 blackburn	but I don't get much
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, you can do some really cool things with it
 wiking	heiko: i'm really looking forward to test mmd!
 blackburn	heiko: what can I do with these cool tests?
 wiking	sounds awesome!
 heiko	current experiment here is to place music data on a sine carrier wave via amplitude modulatilon, and then try to dinstinguish two songs from the same interpret
 wiking	heiko: actually have a dataset for that and i'd like to see the weights it finds ... as i have some other methods that generated some 'optimal' weights...
 heiko	balckburn, tell two probability distributions apart with all the gains of "kernel methods"
 heiko	wiking, what kind of data is it and what kind of problem?
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.189.69] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	heiko, what kernel do you use? gaussian or some spline?
 wiking	heiko: i have features from different domains... thus i'm using combined kernels
 heiko	gaussian currently
 heiko	kernels need to be characteristic in order to be usefull
 wiking	heiko: and i'd like to see an optimal weight distrib for the kernels
 heiko	(= their range covers the complete R in the fourier domain)
 heiko	wiking, cool lets try that soon!

@sonney2k	ok thanks heiko!
@sonney2k	one question about the data generators
@sonney2k	what can they produce?
 wiking	heiko: yep i'll update shogun on that machine where the features are and i'll give it a go... it's available in modular_* interface... or?
@sonney2k	is there already an example for using them for e.g. python_modular?
 heiko	sonney2k, currently its really loose, just a class  where you can add (possibly static) methods that poduce data
 heiko	I use them from my examples
 heiko	my methods return a matrix
@sonney2k	heiko, and do you properly seed the rnd number generator to get things reproducible?
 heiko	sonney2k, yeah I have started paying attention to that :)
 blackburn	hmm actually I find the idea interesting
@sonney2k	k
 blackburn	one could say
 heiko	but unfortunately its kind of hard to get it in synch with matlab
 blackburn	just try 4324 seed and you will see a bug
 heiko	but for example
 heiko	I do a seed to compare results of x-validation on normal and precomputed kernel
 heiko	however, thats not data related
@sonney2k	alright so thanks again heiko
 blackburn	heiko: btw
@sonney2k	now final meeting on August 16, 11 UTC - is that ok with everyone?
 blackburn	if we had *distributed* model selection it could be a killer feature
 blackburn	do you think so too?
@sonney2k	blackburn, post shogun 2.0 I would say :D
@sonney2k	so blackburn note it down as wishlist in the bugtracker
 heiko	sonney2k, 16 is fine more me
 wiking	fine by me
 uricamic	ok for me
 vojtech	ok for me
 blackburn	fine
 n4nd0	ok
 cheng	good for me.
 heiko	blackburn, I would say this is great, but has to be separate for differnt kinds of model selection
@sonney2k	puffin444, alexlovesdata ?
 heiko	but grid-search: for sure!
 pluskid	not sure whether I can be there
 blackburn	heiko: yes, for grid (for now)
 pluskid	I will be a student volunteer for KDD, which runs through Aug. 12~16
 puffin444	There's a chance that I will be moving to Pittsburgh on that date
 pluskid	If it finishes early, then I guess I can attend
 pluskid	since it is about 19:00 in local time
 heiko	blackburn, actually thats not too hard using threads (only  non-locked machines)
 heiko	blackburn, ah, subsets
 heiko	not thread safe
 blackburn	heiko: not parallel
 blackburn	distributed!
 heiko	but one could start seperate processes
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko - later!
 heiko	I see
 ckwidmer	16th ok with me
@sonney2k	pluskid, puffin444 well then your mentors can hopefully join and we do some mini celebration with only you later
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, ^?
 alexlovesdata	ye
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	alright then - thanks everyone for attending again
@sonney2k	continue the nice work
@sonney2k	and send me *pictures*
@sonney2k	nice ones for the new website
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and send bern4rd kudos for his work!
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure

@sonney2k	wiking, go
-!- cronor [~cronor@fb.ml.tu-berlin.de] has joined #shogun
 wiking	ok so i've said everyting what i think about how we should include unit testing into shogun in the discussion of the PR
-!- puffin444 [62e3926e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.98.227.146.110] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 heiko	give me 5 mins
 heiko	phone ringing
 wiking	but basically i'm not supporting the idea of using submodules
 wiking	i rather go with a separate branch and when we have enough code
 wiking	we just merge
 wiking	this way i can 'commit' all the stuff we'll need for unit testing
 wiking	and then we'll just have one big PR :P
 wiking	but then again i guess
 wiking	there's no discussion anymore
 wiking	about whether we shoudl use google's c++ unit testing and mocking framework for this, or?
 wiking	but anyhow we go
 wiking	i think what would be the best that if possible everybody who's now working on a gsoc project
 wiking	at least add unit testing to their own part
@sonney2k	wiking, I am thinking of splitting up shogun even a bit more into shogun / interfaces / data / tutorial / examples&tests
 wiking	since you know the best what should happen with your code
 wiking	creating unit tests and mocking tests are rather simple
@sonney2k	wiking, the biggest advantage of having a submodule would be that you can directly work on that stuff and merge at your own will
 wiking	and i've added a very simple example into the PR
 wiking	sonney2k: yep i know :)
 wiking	sonney2k: that's very tempting
 wiking	sonney2k:  but my concern is more about how a PR would go
 wiking	let's say after we get unit testing into a good state
 wiking	and we could require that each new module/class
 wiking	must have unit testing added as well
 wiking	then it'll be very complicated
 wiking	to do a simple PR
 heiko	re
 wiking	sonney2k: because it'd be great to have one of those pre-commit hooks working in shogun repo for developers... of course we cannot enforce developers to use that, but still we could ask them nicely in a README.developer
 wiking	or something
@sonney2k	wiking, I cannot follow... what do you want to discuss?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes that makes sense
@sonney2k	but that is just extra candy
 wiking	sonney2k: the submodule vs directly into shogun repo
 blackburn	I do not think hooks are so useful
 n4nd0	all right, time to get on board
 n4nd0	see you guys, thank you for the meeting!
 blackburn	n4nd0: have a good flight
 n4nd0	blackburn: thank you :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, have a nice flight
 n4nd0	thanks
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@192.36.80.8] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 wiking	sonney2k: and that to require a little bit of unit tests from all the gsoc developers
 wiking	if possible
 heiko	n4nd0 have a good flight!
 wiking	n4nd0 safe tripe!
 wiking	*trip
 wiking	sonney2k: so for example could we agree to ask all the gsoc-ers in shogun to create unit test, except gsomix? :)
 wiking	sonney2k: nothing so fancy... just something really basic
@sonney2k	wiking, I think we are a little late for that now (requiring contributions from everyone - maybe one example or so from each gsocer)
 heiko	wiking, I would agree on that, at least some
@sonney2k	... is the only thing we can possibly manage
 wiking	sonney2k: i mean really i dont want any full blown mocking stuff
 wiking	just a very basic unit testing
 wiking	for at least one class then :)
@sonney2k	wiking, for some part of the code - ok
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah that'd be more than enough i think
 wiking	sonney2k: just to keep it a little flowing
 wiking	so maybe somebody could pick up the thread later...
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	ok so back to submodule / not submodule
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'm really
@sonney2k	what is the advantage of having it not as submodule?
 wiking	up for getting examples out to a submodule
 wiking	:))
@sonney2k	1 commit, 1 PR right?
 wiking	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	anything else?
 wiking	sonney2k: this way you can really see that unit testing is at least handled somehow...
 wiking	sonney2k developers must use it
 wiking	sonney2k: as git submodule --init is optional ;)
@sonney2k	anyone else have an opinion on that?
 wiking	sonney2k: i know that currently almost everybody is using the git HEAD of the master when using shoung
@sonney2k	wiking, most people just need the source
 wiking	but idealy only developers would do that
 heiko	I like this approach, this way, only developers see it
@sonney2k	they don't care about tests :)
 wiking	sonney2k: yes... but what i'm saying is that actually most people wouldn't need the source at all :)))
 wiking	sonney2k: just the binary release :P
@sonney2k	wiking, we are still not there yet...
 wiking	sonney2k: i know of course...
 wiking	i'm just saying that as an end goal
 wiking	that would be the ideal
@sonney2k	blackburn, pluskid, uricamic opinions?
 wiking	yeah but let's just do a quick vote on this, or? :)
 wiking	with sonney2k having a veto on it ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, I don't have strong feelings on that
 blackburn	sorry I am ab it lost
 pluskid	no preference here :-/
 wiking	blackburn: submodule or no submodule for unit testing
 wiking	blackburn: or dontcare ;)
@sonney2k	just thought that it is more clean and convenient to have it all in one tests/ dir and let you take control over it
 blackburn	wiking: so what is the question? :)
 wiking	blackburn: :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 wiking	blackburn: VODKA?: )
 blackburn	wrong
* wiking failed big time :)
@sonney2k	wiking, vodka is the answer!
@sonney2k	not the question
 blackburn	exactly
 wiking	blackburn: more vodka?
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	it is the answer again
 wiking	ok anyhow :>> as i'm failing here
 wiking	submodule then?
 wiking	i mean it'll be a little bit of a hassle
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko, pluskid - submodule y/n/<don't care>
 blackburn	n
 blackburn	hmm
 alexlovesdata	I do not understand the problem really, I hope none is angry about it
 blackburn	n
 pluskid	don't care
 wiking	heiko: ?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I am crazy angry about that
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	blackburn: :D
* wiking just migrating to llvm 4.0... yey :)
 blackburn	wiking: will you be available 2 hrs later?
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, russians always are (when they lack the right level of vodka in blood)
 wiking	blackburn: i hoped not to be
 blackburn	argh

 blackburn	5-6 would work too
 wiking	heiko: pinguuu
 blackburn	the more the better
 wiking	blackburn: that's ok by me i guess ;P
 blackburn	wiking: not sure if alexlovesdata would accept it though
 blackburn	so just let me know what you've decide
 heiko	wiking, I also dont really have a preference as both approaches have their downsides
 alexlovesdata	accept what?
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: 5-6 hrs later :)
 wiking	sonney2k: your call :)
 alexlovesdata	you mean to talk in 5-6 hours?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	alexlovesdata: yes
@sonney2k	wiking, I prefer submodule
 wiking	sonney2k: ok then we go with that
 alexlovesdata	then lets chat at 9 PM ?
@sonney2k	wiking and you in code?
 blackburn	what's timezone?
@sonney2k	no idea what the vote is now
 wiking	sonney2k: well i'm for n
 alexlovesdata	middle european ... too late for you (+1 I think) ...
 wiking	sonney2k: so 2 non-submodule, 3 dontcare
 alexlovesdata	ot are you living in Tshukshcia?
 blackburn	not too late I live in UTC-5
 blackburn	virtually
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	wiking, so then no submodule
 wiking	sonney2k: but u have the veto :))))
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: tshukshcia :D
 wiking	sonney2k: u shall use it wisely ;P
@sonney2k	as I said I don't have strong feelings about it
 wiking	sonney2k: ok... then no submoodule
 wiking	sonney2k: then can we merge?
 heiko	wiking, how to proceed now?
@sonney2k	and one can at any time convert a dir into a submodule
 alexlovesdata	yeee. wiking got it ;)
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: it is a name of people so you should rather ask 'are you tshukcia?'
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	sonney2k: or is there something you want it to be change still in that PR?
@sonney2k	argh puffin left already
 alexlovesdata	I did not know how the landscape would be named ;)
 wiking	heiko: i think now it's time to ask nicely gsocers to try to add some simple unit testing for their code, after the PR has been merged
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: chukotka
 alexlovesdata	ok!!
 heiko	wiking, Ill merge it and fly over it, see how its works etc
 wiking	heiko: and for you and me to crazy produce unit testing :)))
 wiking	heiko: GREAT!
 alexlovesdata	wiking, blackburn ... so at what time we like to talk about VOC?
 wiking	ok so i think then unit testing is settled
 heiko	I will write a mail later this week, nicely asking people to add tests for the most iportant methods, and how to design these etc
 alexlovesdata	9 PM local time ok for wiking?
 wiking	heiko: sounds like a plan!
 wiking	alexlovesdata: for sure not
 wiking	alexlovesdata: i've just realised
 heiko	ok Ill merge ..

 blackburn	some dogs IIRC
 alexlovesdata	so the large scale stuff
 wiking	alexlovesdata: mainly task1 and task2
 wiking	alexlovesdata: but of course VOC woudl be great as well
 wiking	i have a cluster of 9 nodes
 wiking	running hadoop
 wiking	and have 7tb space on a hdfs
 alexlovesdata	how many CPUS?
 alexlovesdata	node = ?
 wiking	alexlovesdata: 9*4

 wiking	anyhow
 wiking	the thing is
 wiking	that i have to go now :)))
 wiking	so i just wanted to give an update what we thought about doing

 KMcQuisten	Hello again!
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	what is problem today? ;)
 KMcQuisten	Thanks for the help yesterday.  I think I have another small problem.  I think something is getting freed twice when I use DirectorKernels in MKL.  The process runs fine and I get my results, but the script segfaults upon completion.  Once again I have a script to send you to reproduce.
 blackburn	sure send me
 blackburn	thank you for improving user experience :)
 KMcQuisten	No problem.  I use this package every day, so i'm glad to help make it better
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: what is you are applying it for btw?
 KMcQuisten	Modeling sequence and target data to predict the efficacy of RNAi gene knockdown constructs.
 blackburn	I think we should track it down somehow
 blackburn	so you are using string features widely, right?
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  I use StringCharFeatures, StringWordFeatures to implement Spectrum Kernel, and RealFeatures to model thermodynamic properties of nucleotide sequences
 blackburn	sounds cool
 KMcQuisten	Reproduction script sent
 blackburn	I am asking because I am not really into that stuff
 KMcQuisten	It's quite fun.  We're going to use it to predict RNAi sequences that will effectively knockdown genes critical to cancer growth
 blackburn	I am collaborating with c. widmer on some cancer as well
 KMcQuisten	Let the computer figure it out instead of spending millions in a lab
 blackburn	but for now I only have worked on microarray data
 KMcQuisten	Right on
 blackburn	okay thanks for the script let me check now
 KMcQuisten	That's great for the large scale ON/OFF switching to see what genes are on in tumors, then we do specific screens against those genes to build datasets for modelling knockdown of those genes.
 blackburn	I feel stupid now :D
 KMcQuisten	Ha!  Don't feel bad.  I knew nothing about molecular genetics when I started work on this project.  Just a lowly mathematician among the bio nerds :)
 blackburn	I wish I could take some course on that but that country is just totally outdated
 KMcQuisten	?
 blackburn	I mean nobody in my university and probably even city knows anything about molecular biology :)

 KMcQuisten	Ah, I see
 blackburn	and no optional courses in educational system at all
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: where editdist comes from?
 KMcQuisten	Gah!  It's another package.  I forgot that it was in there
 KMcQuisten	Let me edit the definition
 KMcQuisten	and resend
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: what can I use instead?
 KMcQuisten	sum([1 for x,y in zip(s1,s2) if x!=y])
 KMcQuisten	that's hamming distance, a bit simpler
 KMcQuisten	but it should work without needing a reference to the editdist package
 blackburn	I used sequence matcher but it fails to converge
 blackburn	let me try hamming-like
 puffin444	blackburn, is the build still broken?
 blackburn	okay I reproduced it
 blackburn	I don't know :D
 KMcQuisten	Nope, I rebuilt about 20 min ago and it's fine
 blackburn	puffin444: well check that http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/251/steps/test%20python_modular/logs/stdio
 blackburn	gaussian_process_modular seems to die or so
 KMcQuisten	I always do a fresh pull and rebuild to make sure my bugs are still bugs before I come in here for help :)
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: btw you can use apply now
 blackburn	with libsvr
 KMcQuisten	Yes I noticed :)  got it all sqaured away in my code
 KMcQuisten	thanks blackburn
 blackburn	not the best way we did
 blackburn	so one need to track properly these renames
 KMcQuisten	Yeah, making swig magic happen is easily broken
 puffin444	uh oh, the buildbot doesn't have pylab?
 blackburn	puffin444: is it a graphicla examplE?
 blackburn	put it into the graphical then ;)
 puffin444	yes that is the one
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: interesting bug
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: did director kernel work for you before?
 KMcQuisten	Yes, we did.  I think some of the recent changes with ref counting may have broken this.
 KMcQuisten	It had worked, and it's still working, save for not properly deallocating at the end.
 KMcQuisten	The machine trains fine, I can extract alphas and support vectors, and make predictions on unseen functions, it just crashes when the object is destroyed.
 blackburn	yeah I see
 blackburn	actually reference counting works bad here
 KMcQuisten	oh?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: each get_lhs and get_rhs increases reference counter but it doesn't get down hmmmm
 KMcQuisten	odd
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: in your example it goes to 124747 :D
 KMcQuisten	Gah!
 KMcQuisten	That's no good
 KMcQuisten	Ok, I have to run to a research group meeting.  Feel free to email me if you discover anything
 blackburn	sure
