 [1]warpy	sonne|work, did you see my msg ?
 sonne|work	yes just saw it
 sonne|work	we don't have free manpower for that currently
 sonne|work	we will be getting windows / osx build bots
 sonne|work	so when these are there I will at some point make sure shogun compiles on osx/windows
 [1]warpy	any estimation on that, time frame wise ?

 aelray	hi
 aelray	somebody here?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	though busy and at work
 sonne|work	just shoot
 [1]warpy	sonne|work, no work plan / time frame yet ?
 [1]warpy	also is anynone else working on the c# examples beside us ?
 aelray	i have a basic question on ML and am not shure if it is solveable with shogun
 aelray	my problem is i have to detect polygonal regions with only 90 degree corners in greyscale images
 aelray	values inside this regions have usually higher amplitude than outside, the outside can be considered somehow black, except for noise
 aelray	i need to extract the exact corner positions, can a SVM do this?
 sonne|work	aelray: you could extract some context around the corners, like +/- 10 pixels or so and then using that 10x10 image try to detect if there is a corner in the middle
 sonne|work	and then slide that thing around
 aelray	ok, and this is realizable with sn SVM?

 sonne|work	aelray: you have to extract these windows manually - but then classifying e.g. with gaussian kernel could already give you reasonable results
 aelray	ok, so i have to extract a lot of small like 10x10 pictures from my datasets with and without corners? how much do i need ca.?
 sonne|work	the more the better / I guess limited only by computation time / storage :)
 sonne|work	thousands
 aelray	sounds like fun
 aelray	is this working even when the corner is not visible to human eyes but one knows, because of geometry, that there must be one?
 sonne|work	trial and error...
 aelray	ok, thanks so far

@sonney2k	Anyone here, blackburn?
 blackburn	sonney2k: here
 blackburn	hellloooo
-!- alesis-novik [~alesis@cpat001.wlan.net.ed.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, still there?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeap
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you remember how big the modshogun_wrap.cxx is for python_modular?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is 16.7 mb on my git
@sonney2k	blackburn, I meant number of lines
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	sonney2k: 508k
@sonney2k	exact number?
 blackburn	sonney2k: 508888
@sonney2k	$ wc -l interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
@sonney2k	516531 interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
@sonney2k	?!
 blackburn	blackburn@blackburn-laptop:~/shogun/shogun/src$ wc -l interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 blackburn	508889 interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
@sonney2k	blackburn, how did yo configure?
@sonney2k	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/shogun-1.0.0 --disable-optimization --enable-debug ?
@sonney2k	or sth
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't remember
 blackburn	shall I reconfig it?
@sonney2k	yes please
 blackburn	compiling
@sonney2k	blackburn, you don't have to compile it to the end
@sonney2k	just when the *.cxx file is there is sufficient
@sonney2k	blackburn, so how big is the *.cxx?
 blackburn	blackburn@blackburn-laptop:~/shogun/shogun/src$ wc -l interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 blackburn	508889 interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 blackburn	sonney2k: the same
@sonney2k	hmmmhh let me treat the remaining classes in features/* and then git push
@sonney2k	blackburn, then please check again
@sonney2k	I removed a lot of code from the headers
 blackburn	hmm I forgot to commit some changes
@sonney2k	so it cannot possibly grow but what shall I say...
@sonney2k	blackburn, today I tried your GNB
 blackburn	sonney2k: and how it was? :)
@sonney2k	for two-class I would love to have floating point values
@sonney2k	not 0 and + 1
 blackburn	pretty hard to get comprehensible map from probabilities to resulting labels
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	btw
@sonney2k	just  prob(x|theta_+) - prob(x|theta_-)
 blackburn	for twoclass it is better to use logistic regression
 blackburn	it is almost equal but faster
@sonney2k	where theta+/- are the model params
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm going to sleep now, am I needed now?
 blackburn	with .cxx issues
@sonney2k	if you can wait for a few more minutes
@sonney2k	I would be very interested in knowing whether the situation improved
 blackburn	yeah sure
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r9c69c84 / src/shogun/preprocessor/Preprocessor.h : fix comment type to get it integrated in doxygen - http://git.io/N-RhJw
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r5fee0e6 / src/README.developer : mention that one should avoid inline functions - http://git.io/yLgAfw
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8b4ce6c / (33 files):
 CIA-3	shogun: remove most inline functions in features
 CIA-3	shogun: - exceptions are some single line functions
 CIA-3	shogun: - templated classes - http://git.io/vCcP0w
@sonney2k	blackburn, please compile again
@sonney2k	with the update ^
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but first will commit some changes I did before
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think the rule should be one of us two doing one (small) git push every day
 blackburn	eh?
@sonney2k	the last week the project looked pretty dead
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	so 1 commit / day improving minor things is helpful
 blackburn	okay got it
 blackburn	I won't commit, I didn't manage to finish it yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, then create a local branch and configure compile again
@sonney2k	I would be interested if what I did changed anything
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just stashed it
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think I will do the header changes removing all unnecessary includes / putting things into .cpp files and thus libshogun.so
@sonney2k	so that's my task for the next weeks
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	and bug fixes here and there as usual
@sonney2k	(btw I am still messing with the debian package - tough...)
@sonney2k	blackburn, does it compile?
@sonney2k	the new stuff?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah was troubles with some .cpp I forgot to remove
@sonney2k	I mean is the *.cxx already generated?
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	generating
 blackburn	sonney2k: my tasks are still get preprocessor faster, etc
@sonney2k	GNB
@sonney2k	:D
 blackburn	I guess you can fix/improve gnb if you will need that :)
@sonney2k	btw the nice graphical gnb example you had could be in shogun examples
 blackburn	I'm in rush with potential paper
 blackburn	so focused on algorithm things
 blackburn	in fact I was reading about superlu on my job for 2 hours :D
 blackburn	sonney2k:
 blackburn	blackburn@blackburn-laptop:~/shogun/shogun/src$ wc -l interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 blackburn	508785 interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 blackburn	sonney2k: but looks faster
@sonney2k	so 100lines less
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	there is more now in libshogun.so
@sonney2k	the headers are just mere definitions
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	this will help removing includes too btw
@sonney2k	and so speed up compilation hopefully...
 blackburn	okay see you tomorrow
@sonney2k	and will solve the problems with lapack being required or so
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	have a good sleep
 blackburn	thanks
@sonney2k	thanks for the report!
 blackburn	you too
 blackburn	report about?
