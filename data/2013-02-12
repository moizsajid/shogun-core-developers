 n4nd0	good news gsoc announcement
 n4nd0	sonney2k, sonne|work, blackburn : so I read it is important to have a release before gsoc, how can I help with that?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 n4nd0	good morning :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: well we need to close all known bugs
 n4nd0	blackburn: in github issues?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes and in general

 n4nd0	blackburn: is tests/integration something still in use or deprecated?
 blackburn	n4nd0: we still can use it
 blackburn	but it could fail a lot I expect
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please run make check-valgrind and paste the result somewhere?
 blackburn	in libshogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, but I need a bit of time, I was trying to make all the examples in libshogun
 n4nd0	but it seems that my Eigen is not detected by configure
 n4nd0	so converter examples are not properly built
 blackburn	hmm true
 blackburn	it is not properly handled I am afraid
 n4nd0	blackburn: in configure?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I mean examples are not guarded
 blackburn	n4nd0: but why it doesn't detect your eigen? any ideas?
 n4nd0	blackburn: my Eigen is in /usr/local/include
 n4nd0	and it seems that the configure script doesn't look in there
 n4nd0	I have used the flag --incdir=/usr/loccal/include/eigen3
 n4nd0	but I am afraid the incdir variable is not used by check eigen3 in configure
 blackburn	it uses pkg-config as I can see
 n4nd0	I don't have that program installed here :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: the thing I am wondering is
 n4nd0	I can just re-install Eigen and I guess it should be fine
 n4nd0	but maybe configure should find it if it is in /usr/local/include
 n4nd0	nvm, pkg-config is installed
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes it should but it currently uses *only* pkg-config
 n4nd0	yep
 n4nd0	that's probably fine
 n4nd0	it's a local problem of mine, I need to make my pkg-config detect eigen3
 n4nd0	Eigen3 support .. yes :)
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	n4nd0: so finally works?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	making check-valgrind on the way
 blackburn	thanks!
 blackburn	I have to go, be back in a few hours
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	i will paste the results and take a look

 n4nd0	blackburn: valgrind results
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/TYjzrCzJ
 n4nd0	everything looks fine except from libary_serialization
 n4nd0	I am guessing that we are OK with suppressed errors

 n4nd0	blackburn: hello hello
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	the results of make valgrind-check
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/TYjzrCzJ
 blackburn	n4nd0: thanks
 blackburn	whoops
 n4nd0	suppressed errors are fine I guess?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	nice to know my code is a little b0rken
 n4nd0	oh fuck
 n4nd0	converter_kernellocallylinearembedding
 n4nd0	and some others
 blackburn	hah my bad
 n4nd0	do you know why can it be?
 blackburn	no - I'd have to investigate
 blackburn	n4nd0: or you can if you want :)
 blackburn	actually it didn't produce so many errors before - quite strange for me
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe something is wrong in my system
 n4nd0	when I run check.sh I get error everywhere
 blackburn	no as it should work on any system :)
 n4nd0	that cannot be good
 blackburn	yes check.sh doesn't work in libshogun examples
 n4nd0	why not?
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you try to run converter_kernellocallylinearembedding?
 blackburn	and valgrind it too
 n4nd0	blackburn: yep
 n4nd0	what is wrong with check.sh then?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't know - I use make check-examples
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/shogun/valgrind.log
 n4nd0	kernellocallylinearembedding
 blackburn	thanks
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can investigate a bit now
 n4nd0	if you are not already on it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no I am now under windows at job :(
 blackburn	n4nd0: looks surprising to me
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am not sure if I ever valgrind-ed tapkee
 n4nd0	did you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: that matrix is not properly initialized strange
 blackburn	yes I did
 blackburn	there were no errors :)
 blackburn	well the fact is LLE works ok but KLLE works bad
 blackburn	as they are the same in tapkee I find that quite strange
 blackburn	n4nd0: I expect I forgot to initialize something or so
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you happen to know if resize in Eigen initializes the matrix or vector elements?
 n4nd0	from the doc it seems to me that it doesn't
 blackburn	n4nd0: no I don't know
 n4nd0	blackburn: take a look
 n4nd0	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/SimplicialCholesky_8h_source.html
 n4nd0	valgrind complains about line 819, so d must be unintiliazed
 n4nd0	and I think this is caused because m_diag is not initialized
 n4nd0	it is resized in 764
 n4nd0	but the values are not set
 n4nd0	and they are used in 803 in an intermediate computation of d
 blackburn	n4nd0: scary!
 n4nd0	yeah...
 n4nd0	but I think it is not due to that probably
 n4nd0	it must be another thing
 n4nd0	blackburn: a think that confuses me
 n4nd0	DefaultSparseSolver in tapkee might be SimplicialCholesky or SimplicialLDLT
 n4nd0	SimplicialCholesky is used at the moment
 n4nd0	but in the method where valgrind complains, DoLDLT is set to true
 n4nd0	it seems a bit contradictory, doesn't it?
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	maybe that method should be called with DoLDLT=false?
 n4nd0	just guessing no real idea :D
 blackburn	I don't know actually
-!- sumit_ [ca4eaca2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.202.78.172.162] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	that all sounds strange
 blackburn	again, LLE and KLLE should both fail
 blackburn	or not
 blackburn	anyway I'll take a look tonight
 n4nd0	that's true
 n4nd0	I am going to check if I discover why it fails in one but not the other
 blackburn	makes sense, thanks
 n4nd0	blackburn: look at this, it confuses me but maybe it tells you something :)
 n4nd0	to simply to std::cout << matrix << std::endl
 n4nd0	of the matrix we are giving to the solver
 n4nd0	rises the conditional jump error in klle and not in lle
 n4nd0	it must be something related to how this matrix is created

 n4nd0	blackburn: you are a professional :)
 n4nd0	let me try it
 blackburn	n4nd0: probably that's the reason - this should fire some warning though
 blackburn	n4nd0: added the issue to not forget about setting that
 n4nd0	blackburn: that solved valgrind's complains indeed
 blackburn	I expect others are caused by something similar..
 n4nd0	probably
 n4nd0	blackburn: about the warning thing
 n4nd0	you mean that we should enable that in tapkee right?
 n4nd0	if some parameters are not set, say it
 blackburn	yes sure n4nd0
 n4nd0	I apply the change if so

 wiking	mmm
 wiking	blackburn: one gsoc idea: recommendation system
 blackburn	wiking: mentor?
 wiking	blackburn: happy to be
 wiking	moreover i can get one person i think
 wiking	from a company that is working on recommendation systems
 wiking	i'll have a chat with him today
 wiking	i can ask him what he would have in his mind
 wiking	for sure he would be ok to comentor with me a project like that

 Guest84830	Hi everyone, I am Parthasarathy G, a computer science under-grad student from IIT Madras, I am interested in contributing for Shogun, can anyone please guide me regarding this?
 n4nd0	Guest84830: hey
 n4nd0	the roadmap normally starts forking the repo, fetching a local copy and building it
 n4nd0	then you could work on something you are interested in or we could suggest you some kind of contribution
 Guest84830	Is there an existing git repo i could pull from?
 n4nd0	Guest84830: yeah sure
 n4nd0	the repository is in github
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 Guest84830	I am currently cloning the repo, thanks for the link.
 n4nd0	you are welcome
 Guest84830	n4nd0: I have finished building the code, but not exactly found where the binaries are
 n4nd0	Guest84830: libshogun.so should be in src/shogun
 n4nd0	it is a good idea to make install too so you can use it from any part on your system

 KMcQuisten	Hello all.  Hope things are going well
 KMcQuisten	I have a quick question that I hope I can get answered
 wiking	shoot
 KMcQuisten	I use LibSVR quite a bit, and have generally used the epsilon-SVR flavor.  The parameter optimization framework only allows one to optimize nu, the maximum fraction of data points that are support vectors.  I know that there's a relationship between nu and the tube epsilon.
 KMcQuisten	I've done the optimization on nu, but when I try to apply those parameters manually, changin nu doesn't seem to be changing the results.
 KMcQuisten	Are the default values for tube_epsilon stepping on my manual setting of nu before training?
 KMcQuisten	And if so how do I fix it?
 KMcQuisten	How does LibSVR determine if it's doing eps-SVR or nu-SVR?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	<pass>
 wiking	i don't know who would be an expert in libsvr here

 KMcQuisten	Well damn.
 KMcQuisten	Well, does anyone know why nu is available for optimization in LibSVR, but the tube epsilon isn't?  It would certainly be very handy to be able to use the built-in model selection fromework to find the best tube epsilon
