 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r9429c0e / src/shogun/evaluation/CrossValidationMKLStorage.cpp : Added handling of multiclass MKL machine in MKL storage - http://git.io/xykkuA
 yoo	blackburn: allright, going to test it
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rb35dbe8 / src/shogun/evaluation/CrossValidationPrintOutput.cpp : Added MKL multiclass handling in CV print output - http://git.io/3dGCzw
 blackburn	okay
 yoo	blackburn: could you explain me again why not using the Evaluation interfaces such as MulticlassAccuracy and MulticlassOVR ?
 blackburn	yoo: what's the difference?
 yoo	blackburn: yes thats it: it is exactly the same right ?
 blackburn	yeah, but it already have to do the same as MulticlassOVR
 blackburn	so I just put binary evaluations there
 blackburn	argh so we need a matrix to store accuracies too?
 yoo	ye
 yoo	isnt already here ? SGVector<float64_t> m_evaluations_results;
 blackburn	no it is for binary
 blackburn	F1/etc
 yoo	ah ok then we need multiclass acc (and confusion matrices)
 blackburn	oh gosh
 blackburn	confusion matrices?
 blackburn	:D
 yoo	thats why I ask
 blackburn	yeahhhh
 yoo	multiclassOVR and multiclass Acc
 yoo	permits to choose what you want
 yoo	and not compute everythg
 yoo	I liked the way modelselecion_output worked
 yoo	msout.add(mc_acc) or msout.add(mc_ovr(roc))
 blackburn	confusion matrices have to be handled in special way still
 yoo	ie ?
 blackburn	you wanted to store it, right?
 yoo	yes
 blackburn	okay I will add it as option
 yoo	then we will have all the mc evaluation possibly stored
 blackburn	yes

 blackburn	okay I will add three options
 blackburn	to constructor
 blackburn	ROC, PRC and confusion matrices
 blackburn	I am a little tired with that code so I will make it constant :)
 yoo	allright
 yoo	=)
 blackburn	I mean not possible to change after calling constructor
 blackburn	it requires special handling
 yoo	I begin to read easily the shogun code then I will be able to help with dirty task if you have some to give
 blackburn	oh I will think about some task to get into development
 yoo	but you can call several options in the constructor right ?
 yoo	and you check with dirty dynamic_cast ?
 blackburn	check what?
 yoo	ROC or PCR : the BinaryEval type
 yoo	the Multiclass Eval type I mean :p
 blackburn	where?
 yoo	nevermind
 blackburn	ah in dynamic object array?
 yoo	yep
 blackburn	well I assume nobody breaks something wrong into that
 blackburn	kind of ugly code that is
 yoo	[100%] Built target shogun
 yoo	 =)
 yoo	well I have to work with cpack for installation, didnt have manage the interfaces .. but this will probably work in the future

 Marty28	Hi!
 Marty28	Can you tell me where I can find a documentation for the data in shogun-data-0.3 ?
 n4nd0	Marty28: for the release of that version?
 n4nd0	to tell the truth I am not sure there's documentation for the data part of the project ...
 n4nd0	at least I don't know about it existence
 Marty28	ok
 n4nd0	Marty28: what do you want to know in any case? I might be able to help :D
 Marty28	It is about /asp
 Marty28	the folder
 Marty28	seems to be splicing data
 Marty28	yet no inline documentation
 Marty28	legacy, probably
 n4nd0	let's check in the commit messages
 n4nd0	nothing there
 Marty28	thx
 Marty28	seems to be truncated anyway
 Marty28	says %asplicer definition file version: 1.0  %acceptor splice acc_splice_b=-2.867314e+00 acc_splice_order=22 acc_splice_window_left=60 acc_splice_window_right=79 acc_splice_alphas=[1.408119e+00, 7.82051 acc_splice_svs=[
 Marty28	I will ask R?tsch, I bet it is their data.
 n4nd0	yes I think so
 n4nd0	have you taken a look to msplice?
 n4nd0	maybe it is related to it
 Marty28	mom

 n4nd0	hey blackburn
 blackburn	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	how are you doing?
 n4nd0	any news with the segmentation application?
 blackburn	fine, and you?
 blackburn	no i didn't make any progress yet
 blackburn	but
 blackburn	I did implement director model
 blackburn	have you seen?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	I didn't
 n4nd0	but cool :)
 blackburn	it works
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	I added code and python example yesterday
 n4nd0	let me check
 blackburn	perfomance wise it sucks
 blackburn	but still
 n4nd0	really?
 n4nd0	very different from the C++ one?
 blackburn	well multiclass generic training is not efficient already
 blackburn	because of big sparse vectors
 blackburn	and swig stuff makes it pretty slow as well
 n4nd0	how is it possible that you didn't have to define get_joint_feature_vector?
 n4nd0	aham there is no need for it in the BMRM algorithm I guess
 blackburn	I made that explicitly in
 blackburn	argmax
 blackburn	BMRM needs only risk
 blackburn	and risk needs only argmax
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	I am not sure if BMRM uses argmax too
 blackburn	and that's actually nice
 n4nd0	apart from inside risk
 blackburn	BMRM uses only risk
 blackburn	but you would need joint feature vectors when computing gradients
 n4nd0	gradients where?
 blackburn	n4nd0: in risk
 blackburn	subgradients
 blackburn	to be correct
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham ok, but thanks to generic risk one doesn't need to define it explicitily either
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: what should I define to use HM-SVM?
 blackburn	what do matrix features contain in means of HM ?
 n4nd0	the matrix features contain the observations
 blackburn	so if I have observations
 blackburn	[0.3, 0.2, 0.1]
 blackburn	[0.5, 0.5, 0.9]
 blackburn	what would be the matrix?
 blackburn	^ or transposed ^?
 n4nd0	ok let's see
 n4nd0	you should first tell me how many features you have
 n4nd0	and time steps
 n4nd0	from what you have written there
 blackburn	okay see what I mean
 blackburn	when we are segmenting image
 n4nd0	I would guess for 1 feature, 4 time steps and two feature vectors
 blackburn	we go through all image
 blackburn	observations are 9 number
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	s
 blackburn	pixel values
 blackburn	of the pixel and its neighborhood
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 n4nd0	so for every pixel you get 9 values?
 blackburn	yes exactly
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	assume image is square
 blackburn	so
 blackburn	it  requires N*N timesteps
 blackburn	got it?
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	but the point is that with just an image
 n4nd0	I don't really see where is the time dimension
 blackburn	n4nd0: you just iterating over all pixels
 n4nd0	ok got it
 blackburn	so all I need is to define that matrix and sequence
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	wait a sec
 n4nd0	what matrix and seq? :D
 blackburn	observation matrix and sequence of {foreground,background}
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	oh nice
 blackburn	okay will be done soon then
 n4nd0	the sequence represent the labels
 n4nd0	cool!
 blackburn	is there an interface to construct labels?
 blackburn	in python
 n4nd0	do you want to discuss something more about the matrix features?
 blackburn	n4nd0: last thing not clear for me is
 blackburn	what is #rows and #cols
 n4nd0	blackburn: to construct the labels just create an HMSVMLabels instance
 n4nd0	you should be able to do it giving an SGVector in the constructor, i.e. an nparray
 n4nd0	for python I meant
 blackburn	so I would need to put
 blackburn	0 and 1
 blackburn	there
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	ok, now about the matrix features
 n4nd0	the matrix features internally is an SGMatrixList, a list of matrices
 n4nd0	each matrix in this list represents the observations of an image, ok?
 blackburn	hmmmm
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	if you want to train your HM-SVM using 100 images, your matrix features will be composed of 100 matrices
 blackburn	right sure
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	all right
 blackburn	that's perfect clear
 n4nd0	now, for each matrix, what are the rows and columns?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	the number of columns is the same dimension of the sequence
 n4nd0	the time of this time series
 n4nd0	you see what I mean?
 n4nd0	it was not a very good description to tell the truth ....
 blackburn	no it is good
 blackburn	so in case I have 200x200 image
 blackburn	I've got 40000 cols
 n4nd0	exatly
 blackburn	each containing say 9 observation values
 blackburn	uh I will try on 50x50 first
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I think that should be your feature dimension
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	got it?
 blackburn	yeah I think I did
 blackburn	lets try to code it
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	and let's hope it is a good model for this problem :)
 n4nd0	it would be really cool if it works
 n4nd0	I wonder how people find these things out
 blackburn	CRF works for that very nice
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	have you taken the inspiration of the features from it?
 blackburn	no I'll try pixels first
 blackburn	it is easy to change features afterwards
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: can state be unknown?
 blackburn	kind of latent state
 blackburn	when you have no idea whether it is a background or a foreground pixel
 n4nd0	mmm no with the state model we use
 blackburn	yes, I mean in theory
 n4nd0	yeah in theory
 n4nd0	I mean, you could add just one state there, unknown
 blackburn	but it would be predicted then
 n4nd0	not really
 n4nd0	you could do an state model
 n4nd0	with this unknown state
 n4nd0	you model the possibility of going from BG or FG to this unknown state
 n4nd0	but you don't model the observations from this model
 n4nd0	it is something similar to the start and stop states that are internally used in the TwoStateModel
 n4nd0	sorry
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	but you don't model the observations from this state
 n4nd0	I said "from this model" before, that was wrong
 blackburn	yes I got it
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	but this should work fine with some noise in there
 n4nd0	so I think you can still use the TwoStateModel and maybe it is not affected badly
 blackburn	okay lets see what it would be
 n4nd0	what kind of images are you using?
 blackburn	cat :D
 blackburn	one image yet
 n4nd0	isn't it a pain to "label" it?
 blackburn	I asked my gf before
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I mean to generate this background/foreground vector
 n4nd0	did she do it?
 blackburn	yes for one image
 blackburn	it is not that hard
 n4nd0	not hard but kind of pain in the ass to do it
 n4nd0	I guess it depens on the method too
 blackburn	no not really, takes 3-4 minutes
 n4nd0	aham not that bad then
 n4nd0	do you use something like a GUI?
 n4nd0	or?
 blackburn	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/segm/image.jpg
 blackburn	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/segm/mask.jpg
 blackburn	I am going to teach HM model on that image and predict
 blackburn	and we will see what it models
 n4nd0	just for an image?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	let's see
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmsvmlabels segfault on adding if default constructor is called
 blackburn	one should be careful :)
 n4nd0	ups
 n4nd0	probably it is because no memory is allocated for the DynamicObjectArray in StructuredLabels
 blackburn	n4nd0: is loss relevant?
 n4nd0	could be
 n4nd0	we just have hinge loss this far though
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	SystemError: Out of memory error, tried to allocate 7378945280 bytes using malloc.
 blackburn	uh
 n4nd0	dafuq
 n4nd0	really? just with one image
 n4nd0	it looks weird to me
 blackburn	something is wrong I believe ;)
 n4nd0	yeah I think so
 n4nd0	how big is the image?
 blackburn	50 x 50 now
 n4nd0	there shouldn't be a memory error for that indeed
 blackburn	I get 0
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	w=0
 n4nd0	not good
 n4nd0	what training algorithm?
 n4nd0	BMRM?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	send me the code and I can try to train it with PrimalMosekSOSVM
 blackburn	again -
 blackburn	# of cols
 blackburn	= time dimension
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	yes, let me check just in case
 n4nd0	in this case it should be 2500
 blackburn	I do not use border pixels
 blackburn	so feature matrix
 blackburn	is
 blackburn	(2304, 9)
 blackburn	is that correct?
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	number of columns is the 2nd dimension
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	shouldn't it be the other way?
 blackburn	I am a little mixed
 n4nd0	num_rows = 9
 n4nd0	num_cols = 2304
 blackburn	that's how it should be?
 blackburn	no it is now
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	the length of the state sequence
 n4nd0	should be equal to the second dimension of each element in matrix features
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	not zero now
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	what was it?
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	how to extract sequence now
 blackburn	from a prediction
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	so apply gives you StructuredLabels right?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	got it
 n4nd0	use HMSVMLabels::obtain_generic to get HMSVMLabels
 blackburn	I don't have to
 n4nd0	and later just do a get_label(0)
 n4nd0	ok...
 blackburn	I should rather obtain Sequence from generic
 blackburn	get_label(0) works already - it is defined in structured labels
 n4nd0	true
 n4nd0	the frist obtain_generic is not really necessary
 n4nd0	loss of time :D
 blackburn	argh
 n4nd0	what?
 blackburn	typemap didn't work
 blackburn	I've got sgvector
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@122.174.73.211] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	I will add a getter there
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I did that once but didn't commit it
 n4nd0	I thought I was doing something wrong in python
 n4nd0	why the typemap doesn't work?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	I hope it would be typemapped now
 blackburn	everything is a background
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	but I think that the concept of training with one image is weird
 blackburn	but it should fit to the image, right?
 n4nd0	if we map it to non-structured learning
 n4nd0	I don't really know to tell the truth
 n4nd0	from the point of view of the HM-SVM it looks like that
 n4nd0	but if you think of the training algorithm
 blackburn	if we train svm with one point
 n4nd0	you just have one example
 blackburn	it won't make an error
 n4nd0	so it is weird
 n4nd0	I don't think that is the right way of thinking of it ...
 blackburn	oh I've got something
 n4nd0	what?
 blackburn	some strange pattern
 n4nd0	in any case
 n4nd0	I think that for one example it is not going to work pretty good
 n4nd0	at least it gives me that feeling regarding the way in which the training algorithm works
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	but still
 n4nd0	hehe you are hard to convince
 blackburn	lambda changes the game
 blackburn	well I saw approximately correct result
 n4nd0	we need some sort of model selection for that lambda very badly
 blackburn	http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jckrumm/WallFlower/TestImages.htm
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'll try on that ^
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	it seems a different concept this of brackground maintenance
 n4nd0	but probably we can use the data for our purpose?
 blackburn	why different?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	something is kinda different yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/segm/cat.png
 blackburn	not that bad in general
 n4nd0	just one image in training?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	yes, not too bad
 n4nd0	it will be better with more probably I guess
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	and with better features
 n4nd0	can you use the images there then?
 blackburn	from microsoft research?
 blackburn	I'll try later
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	brb
 blackburn	I need to learn blender, no way to get back to 3ds max I know pretty well :(
 blackburn	time to update NEWS
 n4nd0	for what do you want to use blender?
 n4nd0	you don't like 3D max?
 blackburn	to generate synthetic images
 blackburn	I don't have windows
 n4nd0	synthetic images?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes, for example some vase to segment :)
 blackburn	or anything like that
 blackburn	car
 blackburn	anything
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	in 3D?
 blackburn	yes
