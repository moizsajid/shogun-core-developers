@HeikoS	link?
 Saurabh7	its std::iota
 Saurabh7	sec
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	crap I forgot
 Saurabh7	replace or guard ? :)
 Saurabh7	cant guard i think
@HeikoS	guard it and offer a replacement
@HeikoS	so when we make c++11 a dependency, we remove the else branch of the guard

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: jo
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: one thing I kind of forgot yesterday
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we want to merge the linalg to develop asap, so keep on working on that
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: next step is to grep for linalg operations used in shogun, and then put them into your new version one by one
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: maybe start with dot
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and then, there are also some CMake switches that can go (they were for compile time backends, which we dont have anymore)
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: maybe send a little PR for that every day then we should have it merged within two weeks
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: I got it
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: just seeing your patch
@HeikoS	that is exactly what I mean :)
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: the goal should be that we completely replace the old linalg
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure.
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: like set_const method - which is in sgvector.cpp right now - it can be done with native and viennacl backend. but i didn't find a good way to use eigen3

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: native?
@HeikoS	eigen3 now is natie
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: just use memset ;)
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: so i'll map the SGVector -> EigenVector, then memset
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: no need to map even
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: is max on GPU faster than on CPU?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: there's sth. wrong with max on GPU now. there's a pointer being freed was not allocated and i'm still looking for the reason
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: can you research whether MAX on GPU makes sense at all?
@HeikoS	I think it does
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: why not?
@HeikoS	yeah all good
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ok make sure unit tests are fine and memory check as well
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: bte your infer backend needs a null check for GPU backend
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: other patches are all fine
@HeikoS	kk
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: add that in separate patch
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so about the max
@HeikoS	I thinkt he use case is
@HeikoS	I do some operation on giant matrix
@HeikoS	that already lives on gpu
@HeikoS	and then I wanna find max
@HeikoS	and do another operation on gpu
@HeikoS	my question now is: how fast is the max? this kernel being compiled, how long does that take?

 OXPHOS	HeikoS: how can i find out about it?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: read up, but do that a bit later
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: put it on TODO list
@HeikoS	I dont think max is used anywhere
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so in terms of re-factoring
@HeikoS	can you first refactor the operations that are actually used in shogun?
@HeikoS	and then also replace them?
@HeikoS	and remove them from old linalg?
@HeikoS	you could do that for dot and add already
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: so u want me to put a "not implemented" sign for max or just leave it like that for now ?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: leave the PR

@HeikoS	might have inet, but will be very busy so might not respond
@HeikoS	bzdmgz: wiking ^
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: kk
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: ok
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: I am looking at the multicore liblinear right now,
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: anything surprising in there?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: there is additional functionalty introduced to reduce vectors
 Saurabh7	that might be needed to add
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: can you share something?
@HeikoS	what does that mean?
 Saurabh7	hm I downloaded the code
 Saurabh7	sec
 Saurabh7	https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/multicore-liblinear/
@HeikoS	where is the vector reducing?
 Saurabh7	in the zip :)
@HeikoS	file=
@HeikoS	?
 Saurabh7	nr_thread = omp_get_max_threads();
 Saurabh7	this->size = size;
 Saurabh7	tmp_array = new double*[nr_thread];
 Saurabh7	for(int i = 0; i < nr_thread; i++)
 Saurabh7	tmp_array[i] = new double[size];
 Saurabh7	}ok lemme put in gist or something
@HeikoS	but this is just efficient multicore coding
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: you might learn from it in fact
@HeikoS	on how to best do this
@HeikoS	for other codes
 Saurabh7	yeah there is static scheduling used everywhere
 Saurabh7	maybe because its standlone package ?
 Saurabh7	we cant do that or?
 Saurabh7	https://gist.github.com/Saurabh7/5840fb533c90ed233c5ad4a29777ce6e
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: actualy this might be optional
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: why cant we do that?
@HeikoS	I mean you can play around with that and see what happens
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: in fact, we can put some of these things into linalg
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: since shoguns linalg does these reductions already
@HeikoS	as a first go, you can put this code in as it is
@HeikoS	and then we can refactor once we established working tests
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: can you add linear classifier to benchmark framework as well?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  so that we have a before after time wise?
 Saurabh7	ok I ll add
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: we can add it, but have guard it with omp guards
@HeikoS	sure

 sanuj	accuracy doesn't change much with epochs

@HeikoS	ehm
@HeikoS	maybe the problem is too easy?
@HeikoS	did you try what accuracy a KRR gives?

@HeikoS	or a GP?

 sanuj	bzdmgz, heyy
 bzdmgz	sanuj:
 sanuj	bzdmgz, what to do after create
 sanuj	and I want to discuss one thing
 sanuj	bzdmgz, got time?
 bzdmgz	sanuj: mmm
 bzdmgz	yeah ok
 bzdmgz	a few minuts
 sanuj	bzdmgz, so i think we need a common list of classes for set/get/has/create
 bzdmgz	exactly
 bzdmgz	just one list
 sanuj	i can set up a framework, either jinja or macros which instantiates set/get/has/create
 sanuj	and the generated file can be included in SGBase.i
 bzdmgz	jinja is good
 sanuj	bzdmgz, let's focus on jinja, we can keep adding classes to the list later
 bzdmgz	sanuj: just put some .txt somewhere
 bzdmgz	and try to integrate jinja
 sanuj	okay
 bzdmgz	you can find some examples in cmakelists
 sanuj	bzdmgz, but we don't need to worry about shogun base classes right now
 sanuj	we can add the classes to the list later too
 sanuj	bzdmgz, i can start with basic 4-5 classes that you suggest
 sanuj	bzdmgz, and only change MockObject to test the swig code and not change the shogun classes for tags
 sanuj	bzdmgz, what say?
 bzdmgz	sanuj: yeah good
 sanuj	bzdmgz, and i will add create in my  tags-swig PR?
