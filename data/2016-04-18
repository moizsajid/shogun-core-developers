@HeikoS	wiking: ping!

@wiking	HeikoS: pong pong
@HeikoS	wiking: saw rahuls email?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	it'll take longer time to answer that
@HeikoS	wiking: I would love to reach a conclusion there
@wiking	heheh
@wiking	we are very different in approach
@wiking	"two different binaries of Shogun"
@wiking	this is a total fucking bullshit
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	well please make suggestions
@HeikoS	the current situation is not good as things are neither decided nor optimal
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	but rushing things
@wiking	will not amke things better either
@wiking	:)))
@HeikoS	I dont want to rush, I want to progress
@HeikoS	I want to avoid stalling
@HeikoS	quite a difference
@wiking	aws?
@wiking	website?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	e.v?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	llalaa
@HeikoS	lets stay on linalg for a second
@wiking	let's try to do more things at a time
@wiking	:)
@wiking	we are more than 1 person
@HeikoS	as I said, it would be good to conclude something for that
@HeikoS	otherwise the discussion was pointless
@wiking	no it's not pointless
@wiking	but it takes time
@HeikoS	sure sure
@HeikoS	thats fine
@HeikoS	but this pattern we have where a suggestion just gets blocked and then *nothing* happens is not helpful as well
@wiking	well
@wiking	when the suggestion
@wiking	is really bad
@HeikoS	so what I want to get at is what the way forwarrd here is
@wiking	what else do you expect?
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	the suggestion is to discuss
@wiking	i'm sorry i dont want to hurt anybody's feeling
@wiking	but this is a mediocre suggestion
@wiking	on a bigger problem
@wiking	nothing personal
@HeikoS	yes all fine
@HeikoS	but what is better?
@HeikoS	how to do it
@HeikoS	this is what we need
@HeikoS	technical discussion that is constructive
@HeikoS	even if we just progress in design, that is helpful
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then first of all
@wiking	let's act as an open source library
@wiking	and not a hidden thing
@wiking	so i'll CC my answer to shogun@mailinglist
@wiking	because it's a bit of awkward to do design decisions
@wiking	in an open source library
@wiking	behind the scence
@wiking	*scene
@wiking	i mean are we deliberately not using the fact that we are opensource?
@wiking	ie rely on external 'help'
@HeikoS	dude what are you talking about? :D
@wiking	that email
@HeikoS	I just wanted to push the email thread a biut
@wiking	yes
@wiking	me too
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	however you think it is best
@wiking	and it was my fault
@wiking	in the first place
@wiking	that i did not start this on shogun@
@HeikoS	I care more *that*...not so much *how*
@HeikoS	so yeah lets make it publixc
@HeikoS	but that is not my point here
@HeikoS	but just some detail
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	we are forbidden do talk about gsoc
@wiking	publicly
@wiking	right?
@HeikoS	only # and who
@HeikoS	not that
@HeikoS	"that"
@HeikoS	also we can say which projects have priority, we already did that
@wiking	" In absence of an alternative idea, I'd say we go on with option 1 for now"
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	you cannot do things like this :)
@wiking	i mean a) either you do it put the patch there and that's it
@wiking	b) discuss
@wiking	now this halfway between a and b
@wiking	is bs bingo
@HeikoS	how to do it?
@HeikoS	we have had so many discussions in this pattern
@HeikoS	suggestion -> bullshit -> question for alternative -> nothing happens ....
@HeikoS	annoying
@HeikoS	just calling bullshit all the time is not really helpful, better suggestions would be helpful
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but it is still bullshit
@wiking	and sorry
@wiking	but unfortunately
@wiking	i have work
@wiking	so coming up with design is the least of my problems when i touch shogun
@wiking	wanna fix some fundamental problems
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	just answered
@wiking	with an actual alternative
@HeikoS	thanks!
@HeikoS	I see that, have the same problem here. All I want is to get us avoid being stuck there but use the momentum that somebody actually is working on it.
 lisitsyn	going to check that mail soon as well
