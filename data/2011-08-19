@sonney2k	yeah epic failure powered by w. gorbachew
 blackburn	I hope we are only two subscribers of trac
 blackburn	I've generated a lot of mails
 blackburn	hey he is m. :)
@sonney2k	but w - wodka
@sonney2k	or just turn it upside down
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/cmdline_static/builds/68/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	look at this everything fails but test still claims everything is good
 blackburn	wodka gorbachew nice
 shogun-buildbot	build #59 of octave_static is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/octave_static/builds/59  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	Test successful: failure
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	even better it works locally :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: wtf is:
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/kernel_distance.py
 blackburn	why it is in examples
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is the problem?
@sonney2k	blackburn, when running tests - should it run all tests and then fail at the end if one of them failed?
@sonney2k	or should it fail immediately?
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.238.50] has quit [Read error: No route to host]

 blackburn	make leaded to reboot heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is it, why it is root of examples?
@sonney2k	blackburn, when running tests - should it run all tests and then fail at the end if one of them failed?
@sonney2k	 or should it fail immediately?
@sonney2k	I tend to say at the end
 blackburn	at the end
@sonney2k	doing
 blackburn	if we broke something in the middle
 blackburn	we will not see if something is broken too
 blackburn	-> harder to debuuug

@sonney2k	there we go
@sonney2k	ahh root of examples
@sonney2k	blackburn, bug :)
@sonney2k	should be in python_static
 blackburn	yeah that's why I was tending to launch nuclear missile
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw it would be nice to see the actual error
@sonney2k	not just error
@sonney2k	at least at the end
@sonney2k	blackburn, this output http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/python_static/builds/59/steps/test_1/logs/stdio is pretty useless
@sonney2k	ERROR - > great
 blackburn	hooray to the error! hah
 blackburn	no idea how to do that
* sonney2k is a dedicated ERROR collector
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is easy - just store output in an array and print it at the end
@sonney2k	I will do it but not now (need sleep...)
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand why tests are failing on the buildbot
@sonney2k	they all work here locally...
 blackburn	btw is python static working now?
 blackburn	haven't checked for a while
 shogun-buildbot	build #69 of cmdline_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/cmdline_static/builds/69  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
@sonney2k	it should
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh it needs the data submodule to be checked out
@sonney2k	that is why things fail
 blackburn	thought you're sleeping :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm now having a zoo of 9 dim reduction preprocessors :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, I have to figure out how to use the github trigger
@sonney2k	then directly after a commit the buildbot will start its job
 blackburn	github trigger?
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	hmmhh data is big
@sonney2k	the git clone takes ages...

@sonney2k	blackburn, alright - now it in principle works http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/python_static/builds/61/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	there is one python test failing
@sonney2k	but we indeed don't support that for python
@sonney2k	so removing the example would fix it
 blackburn	sonney2k: you will be laughing but my mds is the slowest one ever
 blackburn	I didn't know there is fast tecnhique for double centering
 blackburn	:(
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	I did it using blas
 blackburn	dgemm
 blackburn	fuck
 blackburn	so stupid
@sonney2k	anyway I am dead tired now
@sonney2k	cu tomorrow!
@sonney2k	today even
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	I will be fixing mds
 serialhex	having fun fixing mds blackburn?? :P
 blackburn	serialhex: yeah and wondering how stupid I am
 serialhex	hey,you knew there was something broken (or at least not working well)
 serialhex	and that's the first step to making it better! :D
 blackburn	I noticed it because pca makes it for 0.02s
 blackburn	and mds for 2s :D
 serialhex	wow!
 serialhex	that's crazy!!!
 serialhex	hey, the python rand() func, when you call it like rand(7) does it give you an int between 0 & 6 blackburn??
 blackburn	ehh
 blackburn	is there any rand() function?
 serialhex	and what would "data=rand(dim, dim)" do???
 serialhex	hmm... ok
 serialhex	idk
 blackburn	hmm may be it is numpy function
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	serialhex: yeah numpy func
 serialhex	ahh, it is numpy!
 serialhex	yes :P
 blackburn	returns dim*dim matrix of uniform distributed randoms
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	randint for your task
 blackburn	not numpy
 blackburn	or so
 serialhex	well i'm converting classifier_custom_kernel_modular so i ned to know how those funcs work to translate them properly
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	so it is matrix of dim*dim [0,1] uniform distr blabla
 serialhex	ok cool
 serialhex	i think i know how to solve this stuff!  :)
 blackburn	really funny
 blackburn	I thought MDS is pretty slow
 blackburn	itself
 blackburn	I made distance calculation parallel
 blackburn	I made landmark approximation
 serialhex	ok
 blackburn	and it is fucking awful I did 2 matrix-matrix multiplications
 blackburn	when no need to do it
 serialhex	HA!!! lol
 blackburn	serialhex: another one fact about my stupidity
 blackburn	we have center_matrix function in math
 serialhex	ok
 blackburn	and I didn't use it oooooh
 serialhex	HAHA!!!  :)
 serialhex	it's ok, you'll live! :P
 blackburn	what a shame
 serialhex	well i just had to look up the interface for the random number generator that *I* wrote oh-so-many months ago :P
 blackburn	hey isn't there any lib for that?!
 serialhex	probably, but we have one in shogun that i wrote at the beginning of summer, remember??
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	can't remember
 serialhex	really?  you made the graph for me b/c i couldn't figure out how TF to do it! :P
 blackburn	graph?!
 blackburn	ah!!!!1
 serialhex	yes... it was a normal random function... like 10k iterations to see if it was truely 'normal'
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	yes yes
 serialhex	(or normal enough)
 serialhex	yeah, seems you forgot too :P
 serialhex	geez!  i've had like 3 cups of coffe and a cup of tea and i'm kinda tired!!! :(

@sonney2k	blackburn, alright octave_modular and python_modular are working 100% w/ all examples
@sonney2k	r_modular cannot work until swig is fixed

@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	but first the examples
 blackburn	a lot of work still..
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes but I am positively surprised that octave/python_modular are good to go already
@sonney2k	if we have migrations we could get the old tests for python back to work and then it is even clear that we have no regressions
 blackburn	I guess we have
@sonney2k	I don't really expect any
@sonney2k	1-2 maybe
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you write an analogous check.sh script like I wrote for python_modular for some other $LANG?
@sonney2k	ruby / java / csharp / lua?
 blackburn	yeah but I have to finish kpca first :(
 blackburn	I don't understand what should I do with kpca ..
 blackburn	sonney2k: why preimage is always computed here in stprtool
 blackburn	I really lost the idea of kpca..
@sonney2k	blackburn, the idea is easy - just do pca in kernel feature space
@sonney2k	the inverse mapping is nice to have but not essential
@sonney2k	and I don't know how one could compute it if inputs are not just real valued numbers
 blackburn	so in vojtechs code kernel is used
@sonney2k	(kpca can work with anything)
 blackburn	what is the lhs and rhs for tihs kernel?
@sonney2k	like strings
@sonney2k	lhs == train data, rhs == train or test data
 blackburn	so I have transformation matrix
 blackburn	but what is the kernel in apply? should it be centered?
@sonney2k	lhs=train & rhs=test data
@sonney2k	centering - i think so
@sonney2k	look at vojtechs code he does some magic there

@sonney2k	blackburn, how do we treat this? nightly_none fails (of course) because there are some things required to run the example which are just disabled
@sonney2k	blackburn, should I disable running tests for nightly_* ?
@sonney2k	and only check if things compile?

 blackburn	eh??
 blackburn	there is check.sh already
@sonney2k	a working check.sh
@sonney2k	and it needs to integrate with make install too
@sonney2k	I guess it is not that hard so when that works c# should be easy too
 blackburn	which check.sh should I do?
@sonney2k	and then there is only lua and ruby left
@sonney2k	blackburn, fix the warnings for now
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	that's enough work
 blackburn	kpca is almost ready
@sonney2k	then I guess we will have errors in java_modular tomorrow
@sonney2k	and c#
@sonney2k	and we need to complete examples, i.e. convert the ones from python_modular to octave/java/csharp/ruby/lua
@sonney2k	at least a number of them
