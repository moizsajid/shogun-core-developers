@HeikoS	lambday:  hi!
@HeikoS	how are things?
-!- lambday_ [67157e4e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.78] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lambday_ hi! how are things?
 lambday_	HeikoS: things are good ... saw the ideas list
@HeikoS	lambday_:  like things?
 lambday_	HeikoS: absolutely.. many many things actually :D
 lambday_	HeikoS: I am thinking to give the kernel project a shot
@HeikoS	lambday_: that will be a nice one
@HeikoS	more ML than coding I guess
@HeikoS	and experiments/examples
@HeikoS	Dino, the other mentor is a postdoc in my lab
@HeikoS	so it will be intense
 lambday_	HeikoS: nice :)
 lambday_	HeikoS: in next few weeks will brush/pick up concepts...
@HeikoS	there is loads of stuff already in shogun
@HeikoS	depending on the student, we might even do a bit more bleeding edge research ....
@HeikoS	depnding on context
-!- lambday [67157e4e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.78] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
@HeikoS	the mcmc one might also be nice, and I guess the variational learning one is the most hardcore ML project
 lambday_	mcmc is not there in the list :-/
 lambday_	oh did you update later?
-!- lambday_ is now known as lambday
 lambday	HeikoS: I was checking out the notebook you have
@HeikoS	lambday: must be
@HeikoS	wait
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: could you add the mcmc description to the ideas list?
@HeikoS	lambday: should be there soon
@HeikoS	I can send you an email with the proposal state
@HeikoS	lambday: email sent
 lambday	HeikoS: alright...
 lambday	HeikoS: thanks :)
@HeikoS	that also an interesting one
@HeikoS	but kernels are also
@HeikoS	all of mine are ultra cool obviously ;D
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things apart from that?
 lambday	lol I am back to square one then :P
 lambday	HeikoS: umm.. things are good.. I thought of adding FOIL/kFOIL stuff to shogun - so today was thinking a bit about that as well... its aligned with my thesis..
@HeikoS	whats that?
 lambday	first order inductive learning stuffs -
 lambday	FOL
@HeikoS	lambday: I see, wow thats old school stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: how is the bug hunt going?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah but recently there has been a new field of interest on that area
@HeikoS	lambday: and still interested in the multitask notebook? :)
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, any relevant papers?
 shogun-buildbot	build #62 of osx2 - python is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20python/builds/62
 lambday	HeikoS: well, bug - didn't try after that :(
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build --branch=develop 'deb4 - python3'
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 9m18s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build --branch=develop 'debian wheezy - memcheck'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
 lambday	HeikoS: well, there is one which is used for propositional logic stuff - I am trying to extend that idea to first order
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no but it doesn't matter
 lambday	it uses LP relaxation
@sonney2k	HeikoS, proposal was already excellent
 lambday	HeikoS: I thought lisitsyn was onto the notebook
-!- ChanServ changed the topic of #shogun to: Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox | Next Stammtisch Monday 2014-02-17 19-24hrs UTC |Devs are usually around between 10am-10pm UTC | When asking questions please be patient or use the mailing list. We always answer but it might take a while. | Channel logs http://bit.ly/1eBecWl
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah true, but didnt I also ask you about a notebook?
@HeikoS	nothing happened really so far :)
@HeikoS	LP relaxation is also used in probabilistic ML to solve MRF problems
@HeikoS	technical stuff
@HeikoS	sonney2k: gunnars comments might be nice to have
 lambday	HeikoS: check this one - http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/malioutov13.pdf
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... since lisitsyn said he was going to do it - I didn't explore much.. I will see if possible I will add :)
 lambday	HeikoS: another notebook needs to be made on string kernels - gotta start that one too
 shogun-buildbot	build #108 of deb4 - python3 is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb4%20-%20python3/builds/108

 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah :)
@HeikoS	string kernels and svms and stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: ok I gotta go to bed now, see you tomorrow or so
 lambday	HeikoS: alright man! I am checking out the mcmc project -
 lambday	ciao...
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah that might be cool and infinitely extensible :)
@HeikoS	bye
 lambday	HeikoS: bye :)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix issue #1869
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add coveralls badge to README.md
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: remove coverage stats of examples, tests, benchmark, cmake
 shogun-buildbot	build #2683 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2683  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@89.204.135.226] has joined #shogun
 sonne|osx	wiking: you broke the build ...
 sonne|osx	wiking: looks like you accidentally submitted src/shogun/classifier/vw/VwRegressor.cpp/h
 wiking	:)
 wiking	no i did not
 wiking	i just haven't tested :))))
 sonne|osx	wiking: errm...!?!
 wiking	there's a fix
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Viktor Gal :develop * ab49c7a / src/shogun/classifier/vw/VwRegressor.cpp: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/ab49c7a4c900a7c63bbda9fe2c8c117b1ed9bbb8
 wiking	do not worry
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix erronous function call introduced in the previous commit
 sonne|osx	wiking: we want to do a release ....
 wiking	i know
 wiking	i'm trying to help
 wiking	this should fix like 4 memleaks ...
 wiking	namely all these issues #1848 #1847 #1846 #1845
 sonne|osx	wiking: we need a test for that reflecting it...
 sonne|osx	wiking: all the other memory leaks seem to be serialization related http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20140213-2319.html
 wiking	sonne|osx: well the serialization fws are all good tests for it :)
 wiking	that are currently leaking :)
 sonne|osx	there is one united memory read in serialization ascii
 sonne|osx	but that is due to a bug in libc
 sonne|osx	fscanf will get it in strod
 sonne|osx	when and 'inf'
 sonne|osx	or 'nan' occurs
 wiking	btw hopefully coverage will get above 80% with this removal of some sources
 wiking	ehhe
 wiking	that's shit :)
 sonne|osx	well I think we are again in much better shape than we were previously
 sonne|osx	so we should just release
 wiking	is this really a bug
 sonne|osx	the one thing I would like to fix somehow
 wiking	or it's never going to be fixed?
 sonne|osx	is the python3 thing
 sonne|osx	wiking: we should try the same on debian sid
 wiking	same what?
 wiking	python3?
 wiking	or libc? :)
 sonne|osx	same valgrind analysis
 sonne|osx	yes libc
 wiking	ah
 wiking	 i see
 wiking	i can run it once :)
 sonne|osx	python3 I did already
 sonne|osx	can finally reproduce it
 sonne|osx	serialization of *any* object fails
 sonne|osx	on python 3.3.4
 wiking	lol
 sonne|osx	but works on wheezy
 wiking	bug or features?
 sonne|osx	in 3.2
 sonne|osx	well any object
 wiking	but 3.2 is none stable branch
 sonne|osx	means any shogun object
 shogun-buildbot	build #2684 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2684  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	3.3 supposed to be stable of python3
 sonne|osx	no
 sonne|osx	3.3 fails too
 sonne|osx	so it doesn't help
 sonne|osx	even sth like CTime cannot be serialized
 sonne|osx	but calling the functions manulally works perfect
 sonne|osx	even then
 sonne|osx	so no idea what pickle does there
 sonne|osx	alright
* sonne|osx off train
 sonne|osx	^ wiking another failure?!
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@89.204.135.226] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 wiking	yeah see it
 wiking	double free
 wiking	yeeey
 sonne|work	expected so - we really have to convert the stuff to use refcounted sgvector.

 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: yes
 lisitsyn1	a while ago
 lisitsyn1	I mean it was available before
 sonne|work	http://mloss.org/software/view/539/
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1:  for NN I would just not want to reimplement/the wheel
 sonne|work	we should like for svms
 sonne|work	just interface
 besser82	sonne|work: Sry, I've been ill the last 2 days; had a std::coldWithFever
 besser82	sonne|work: Shall I still try that sniplet?!?
 sonne|work	besser82: yes!
 sonne|work	besser82: sry to hear!
 sonne|work	besser82: I am not sure why I am OK atm, lack of sleep etc should'v killed me
 besser82	sonne|work:  not so nice either  :(
 besser82	sonne|work:  Can't pickle <class 'Time'>: attribute lookup imp.Time failed
 sonne|work	besser82: hah
 sonne|work	so there we have it
 besser82	sonne|work:  ???
 sonne|work	one cannot pickle *anythin*
 sonne|work	g
 sonne|work	weird that it works with python3.2 here
 sonne|work	something must have changed
 sonne|work	in python
 sonne|work	maybe the way they treat external C classes when (un)pickling
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: NN is neural networks?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	sure
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1: maybe we could have a way how to store layers weights / structure of the framework in shogun
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1: then we pass this to any NN-IMPL
 sonne|work	and fill results back in
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1: but maybe the best approach would be to start with some NN library
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: yeah
 sonne|work	because otherwise we won't learn how it works
 sonne|work	it is kind of the way we did it with SVMs
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: yes we just need to get our hands dirty
 sonne|work	yeah
 lisitsyn1	I'll just try to design it and see what I get
 sonne|work	these things are too complex to do on our own so it is good I think if we just outsource complexity
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: worst thing I know about NNs is that there are a lot of things like
 lisitsyn1	normalize this and normalize that
 lisitsyn1	and subtract mean or whatever
 sonne|work	yeah there are a lot of tricks
 lisitsyn1	much more than in svms
 sonne|work	but any algorithm has some
 lisitsyn1	this sucks pretty much

 wiking	sonne|work: it's done now
 wiking	sonne|work: coverage dropped significantly
 wiking	:<
 wiking	since now all the 100% unit tests and examples are out :P
 sonne|work	50%?
 wiking	70.88
 sonne|work	quite good still

 wiking	this we need to investigate a bit

 wiking	since some of the covarage depends on rand()
 wiking	lisitsyn1: here?

 sonne|work	then it should go ways
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't understand what the changed 101 means and source changed 7 etc
 wiking	sonne|work: changed in coverage
 sonne|work	for?
 sonne|work	between what?
 wiking	sonne|work: n-1 coverage results
 wiking	i guess
 sonne|work	so we have 101 files changing coverage?

@iglesiasg	fucking hell...
@iglesiasg	I have the admin editor
@iglesiasg	for some reason, I lost the changes I had saved and seen updated in the website
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what's you are working on?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, the website
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, sonney2k, did you guys by any chance had the admin interface open?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: moving ideas from gdocs to website?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I didn't
@iglesiasg	I don't understand why it happened then...
@iglesiasg	I guess I will work on another editor to have locally a saved copy
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I mean
 lisitsyn	we need to polish it a bit
 lisitsyn	how do we handle that?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, yeah, it is a pain
@iglesiasg	I was just planning to move for the moment the ones that were complete
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: oh I see okay
 lisitsyn	thanks
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so basically
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, deep learning, variational learning, fundamental ML, MCMC, output kernel learning, and variable interactions look pretty ready to me

 lisitsyn	no not really
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	mine are not it seems
 lisitsyn	I'll update some of them tonight
@iglesiasg	well deep learning is yours too :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I hope not!
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, why not? Aren't you co-mentoring that one?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I mean I hope I'll just help with software part ;)
@iglesiasg	at the end of the day, GSoC is just developing software
@iglesiasg	so just the software part is just about 100% of the product :P
 lisitsyn	hah true

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, do you recommend me any fancy html editor?
@iglesiasg	if you know of any
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hmm not sure I am following that
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: isn't vim/sublime/whatever enough?

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I wanted something fancy that would highlight tags and stuff like that

@iglesiasg	you know like the matching tag, maybe the text of the current element when I am editing and so on
@iglesiasg	I will try with sublime, just for fun
