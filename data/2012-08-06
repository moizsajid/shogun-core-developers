@sonney2k	for linear svms yes for kernel svms dot() won't change
@sonney2k	ohh it does - you also need to use bit shifts
 blackburn	but it is probably the same
 blackburn	it would make sense if I had no memory but it fits
@sonney2k	depends - less mem req. may mean better cache usage
@sonney2k	and you will have much less mem accesses too
 blackburn	sonney2k: unfortunately it stopped on 90% :(

 n4nd0	hi blackburn
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	let me ask you
 n4nd0	my compile log looks pretty ugly
 n4nd0	full of warnings related to Eigen
 n4nd0	something local I guess
 n4nd0	lot of things like this one, give me a sec
 blackburn	we all have it :)
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/QjzNk4XY
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	doesn't it look pretty bad?
 blackburn	no not really
 n4nd0	mmm ok
 blackburn	I wanted to fix ithat but forgot
 n4nd0	at least pretty long
 n4nd0	I got a bit concerned because I run some examples but didn't get anything on screen
 blackburn	the key is to make it -isystem instead of -I
 n4nd0	something fishy with SG_PRINT I guess
 n4nd0	I thought it could be related
 blackburn	no should not
 n4nd0	can you please tell me if your SG_PRINT works fine even with those warnings around?
 blackburn	yes, it works
 n4nd0	ok, thank you
 blackburn	n4nd0: you could get warnings off for now
 blackburn	just open .config
 blackburn	find -I of eigen
 blackburn	and make it -isystem instead
 n4nd0	ok, I will do that after my current compilation
 n4nd0	thanks!
 blackburn	I can't stop looking at that cat

 KMcQuisten_	Hey there blackburn
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: hey I just saw your mail
 KMcQuisten_	Righto
 blackburn	no, gsomix was a little away
 KMcQuisten_	*grumble*
 KMcQuisten_	Allrighty.
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: actually all method calls increase reference count with director
 blackburn	so even some debug stuff makes it increase with no limits :D
 KMcQuisten_	Zoinks
 KMcQuisten_	That's a bit of a problem, isn't it?
 KMcQuisten_	:)
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: yes and in your example something makes features to be deleted :)
 KMcQuisten_	Very odd.
 blackburn	kind of shootin' leg
 KMcQuisten_	Yeah I hope gsomix can figure it out soon.  I have a whole host of custom kernels that I want to use the directorkernel framework for.
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: okay I reached him so we will try to figure it out
 KMcQuisten_	Awesome.  Thanks so much, guys.
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: try to call __disown__() on each created director kernel
 blackburn	before using
 blackburn	I have to reconfigure shogun meanwhile
 KMcQuisten_	WHen should I call it?
 KMcQuisten_	Before I pass it to the machine with set_kernel()?  OR after?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: after creation
 blackburn	when you construct combined kernel I think
 KMcQuisten_	Is it a method call from the kernel object, or CombinedKernel.__disown__(directorkernel)?
 KMcQuisten_	or is disown a global function
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: kernel object
 blackburn	x.__disown__()
 KMcQuisten_	Alrighty

 blackburn	uh finally compiled with directors
 blackburn	it goes pretty slow we need to speed up it somehow :D
 KMcQuisten_	Ok, that fixed that segfault.  Now, what about other situations where I'm creating, using and destroying a bunch of director kernels, but not in a combinedkernel?  Do I needto call disown on any director kernel that gets passed to a regular shogun object?
 blackburn	yeah example works here too
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: yeah each time you create anything director - disown it
 KMcQuisten_	Disown it after i pass it to another object, yes?  If I disown it right away won't it be deleted?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten_: well yeah, disown it before use in any shogun object
 blackburn	I am unsure if that can be done automaticall
 blackburn	y
 KMcQuisten_	I can do an isinstance check in my code for that
 blackburn	I will check whether that can be done automatically
 KMcQuisten_	Ok

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh would be better to discus the stuff KMcQuisten runs into on the mailinglist than in privat
@sonney2k	e
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you know about that issue btw?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't even know now and no one else except you does :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, do we have a function in evaluation to get the confusion matrix?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, multiclassaccuracy has one
@sonney2k	blackburn, because https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/679/files#L16R66
@sonney2k	I guess that one shoudl use it then?
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	yes pluskid came with his own solution again
@sonney2k	ok told him
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know if n4nd0 fixes up matrix features to be more general / whether he introduces SGMatrixList as new data type to not have yet another type*, int, int issue later?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh and do you know where gsomix is hiding :D
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	about first
 blackburn	gsomix is available in jabber
@sonney2k	it is pretty bad that we always get *huge* PRs :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know about you but really carefully doing code review for these big monsters is a pain so I only do it superficially...
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah it can be hard sometimes
@sonney2k	pluskids PR has ~1700 lines n4nd0s 2600...
@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh I see your eyes in github
* sonney2k files hypnotized
 blackburn	sonney2k: :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: isn't that cat awesome?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you receive the github love email
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah

 wiking	dunno
 wiking	the mars thingy has landed todaybtw :)
 blackburn	wiking: yeah pretty funny for me to compare that with inquisition taking place in russia

 gsomix	good evening
 blackburn	wiking: btw I was playing around with freaks and they are pretty interesting
 blackburn	wiking: I'd like to use opencv to compute features now
 wiking	blackburn: eheheh told you
 blackburn	rewriting such things is way too slow
 blackburn	sure
 wiking	opencv is good enough for that
 wiking	nothing else though :)
 blackburn	it is ugly actually but nothing better
 wiking	indeed
 blackburn	wiking: so are we going to use BoW?
 wiking	well since i have the code for it
 wiking	we could
 blackburn	wiking: I tried freak on road signs with one keypoint at center of image
 wiking	how was it?
 blackburn	not the best descriptor for sure but ~90% of accuracy can be reached
 blackburn	actually it would be better for a few keypoints I think
 blackburn	wiking: what I do not understand is alex's comment
 blackburn	I mean authors state it works..
 blackburn	one reason to try freak is that it is terrible fast
 wiking	hehhehe
 wiking	well can't we do some dense freak ?
 wiking	or at least yeah we should do several keypoints for bow
 blackburn	wiking: what is dense here?
 wiking	well good question
 blackburn	wiking: you mean some grid of keypoints?
 blackburn	why to do that? in these pics I thought we need a few keypoints
 blackburn	wiking: what is your bow code based on?
 wiking	blackburn: that's fully java+hadoop+mahout code
 blackburn	wiking: how do you compute keypoints/descriptors?
 wiking	blackburn: that's coming from the opencv code in my case
 blackburn	wiking: do you think we can optimize it for binary descriptors?
 wiking	well
 wiking	afaik we could
 wiking	but we should just run  test asap
 blackburn	wiking: what's actual deadline btw?
