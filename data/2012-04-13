 sonne|work	hi n4nd0 - a few warnings are on your account: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/472/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%2824%29
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, I will take of them, thank you!

 sonne|work	n4nd0: btw are you still happily covertree-ing?
-!- xiangwang [~chatzilla@159.226.60.224] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah
 n4nd0	sonne|work: right now I am stuck with some university work, but I during my shogun time I am covertree-ing :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: why?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I got used to hearing break through's from you side :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: :D I am trying to control myself more now
 sonne|work	too bad
 sonne|work	:)
 n4nd0	I discover yesterday though an interesting thing about JL covertree construction in my integration within shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I can show you now
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the context is in CKNN:apply
 n4nd0	sonne|work: here distance is set so distance(train_features, query)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but I need to build two cover trees before being able to do the queries
 n4nd0	sonne|work: one with the train_features, and another with the queries
 n4nd0	sonne|work: to build these trees I need distances, between those features
 n4nd0	sonne|work: i.e to build the cover tree with train_features I need that distance is distance(train_features, train_features)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: and to build the one for the queties: distance(queries, queries)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I have managed to do that using this trick http://snipt.org/uhRh3#expand
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think it is a bit ugly, but it does work!
 sonne|work	yeah for that one would need what you have said
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the problem is that it turns out that the calls to replace_[rhs|lhs] take more time than the creation of the cover trees
 sonne|work	a way to compute distance for rhs,rhs stuff
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	which distance?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what do you mean?
 sonne|work	for which distance does it take more tiem?
 sonne|work	time
 n4nd0	I don't think it is really the distance
 n4nd0	but the calls to replace_lhs and replace_rhs
 n4nd0	in JL's code, both calls (for set_of_points and set_of_queries in the code) to batch_create
 n4nd0	take less time than in my shogun code, using the replace methods in between
 n4nd0	within my shogun code the portion of code I have pasted for you takes 0.2482(s)
 n4nd0	while for JL's, the two calls to batch create take 0.053942(s)
 n4nd0	oh wait
 n4nd0	this may be caused as well for the upper_bound distance thing I told you about!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha I think I did my first breakthrough of the day :D
 sonne|work	I don't understand a thing
 sonne|work	you mean upper_bound stuff is the reason why JL's thing is so fast
 sonne|work	but you don't use it?
 sonne|work	in shogun
 n4nd0	I have not implemented it yet
 sonne|work	and that is why it is so slow?
 n4nd0	I think that the reason why I see that the construction of the trees is slow in shogun
 n4nd0	maybe is because of the thing of the upper_bound distance
 n4nd0	do you understand?
 n4nd0	I am not that good at explaining sometimes :S
 sonne|work	yes OK
 sonne|work	but it is already faster right?
 sonne|work	4 times I mean?
 sonne|work	so you can speed it up quite a bit with this upper_bound stuff
 n4nd0	exactly
 n4nd0	right now it is already faster than the thing we had before
 n4nd0	not as fast as standalone JL though
 n4nd0	it might approach more standalanoe JL doing the upper_bound thing
 sonne|work	nice!

 wiking	yo
 sonne|work	wiking: yo
 wiking	friday the 13th had it's course already on me :)
 sonne|work	wiking - yeah you missed out 2 lines with warning fixes http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/472/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%2824%29
 sonne|work	or was it sth else ?\
 wiking	hahaha sure something else... internet got broken, warm water in the house suddenly stopped working
 wiking	2? i just see one preprocessor/PNorm.h:37:
 wiking	pull request for fixing that error sent out

 wiking	s/FIST/FIRST/
 wiking	actually that's a good question what it should be... afaik the best is to return 1.0 rather than 0.0
 wiking	although that's not 'correct' but it won't hurt as much as if i would return 0.0 and then the caller right away uses the return value without checking to divide a number => divide by zero
 wiking	agree?
 sonne|work	wiking: huh?
 sonne|work	you should init it with 0
* sonne|work thinks wiking didn't have enough sleep
 wiking	and if that gets returned...?
 sonne|work	it doesn't
 wiking	it might...
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	in all if () { } sections norm is computed
 sonne|work	only in the first one it is incremented
 sonne|work	that is why you need the init to 0
 wiking	well it still can happen that 0 gets back
 wiking	but that's the caller's problem then...
 sonne|work	and an independent problem
 wiking	ok
 sonne|work	no matter what you set norm to
 blackburn	THE FIST
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	pull req sent
 blackburn	hey guys have you heard how nice is DPRK's rocket?
 wiking	?

 wiking	yey
 blackburn	wiking: I glanced over your twitter and I admit I do not understand anything
 wiking	some of it is on hungarian :)
 blackburn	yes I meant that ;)
 blackburn	what is csinalok?
 wiking	do
 wiking	actually i'm doing
 wiking	csinalni = to do
 wiking	csinalok = i'm doing
 wiking	or i do
 n4nd0	use a lot twitter guys, I am making a project to rank users and stuff!
 wiking	depends on the context
 blackburn	n4nd0: same with your twitter btw
 blackburn	wiking: there is no difference between I'm doing/to do in russian :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: like in Swedish, no continuous forms!
 blackburn	however you probably know that
 blackburn	that is one of the reasons why we fail with speaking english properly sometimes
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you have articles in Russian?
 blackburn	bingo
 n4nd0	blackburn: like "the house"
 blackburn	no
 n4nd0	the thing I have noticed the most in Russian speakers is that
 blackburn	that's why I (and other russians) mix it up as well hah
 blackburn	however I get used with it a little
 blackburn	earlier it was worse
 n4nd0	I don't think you do that one, at least I didn't notice
 blackburn	no, I still do a lot of mistakes and crazy sentences
 blackburn	but year ago it was really worse hah, right sonne|work?
 blackburn	n4nd0: we also have cases (dative,genitive,etc) there
 n4nd0	blackburn: that must be difficult
 blackburn	not while you are native with it :D
 blackburn	for example
 blackburn	there is a fish
 blackburn	and
 blackburn	there is no fish
 blackburn	would be
 blackburn	ah bad example
 blackburn	word with same cases :D
 blackburn	I mean word is changing in different cases
 n4nd0	like
 n4nd0	the fish is red
 n4nd0	I like fish
 blackburn	???? ???????
 blackburn	? ????? ????
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	when it is subject or DC
 n4nd0	I actually know to say fish in Russian
 blackburn	ryyba? ;)
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	n4nd0: aren't cases there in spanish?
 wiking	blackburn:  ;) just saying ... usually indo-european language based people cannot grasp the idea of having only 3 tenses: past, present and future ;p
 n4nd0	blackburn: no, no cases

 blackburn	wiking: isn't english indo-european? :)
 blackburn	ah only
 wiking	yes it is and it has about 8 tenses :)
 blackburn	yes got you
 blackburn	uricamic: can it be that you do not precompute kernel matrix in your gs krr?
 blackburn	in case it is too large
 blackburn	okay have to go guys
 blackburn	wiking: how much tenses there are in hungarian then?
 wiking	as said 3
 wiking	:)
 uricamic	blackburn: yes, I can change that
 n4nd0	blackburn, wiking the tenses in Spanish are not normal ... too many
 wiking	n4nd0: it's latin based language it's normal
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	ok see you

 n4nd0	too many anyway :)
 pluskid	only 1 tense in Chinese ! :D
 pluskid	I guess
 n4nd0	:O
 n4nd0	you don't have difference between past / present / future at least?
 pluskid	we do not change form of a word
 pluskid	but add more words to indicate the tense
 pluskid	so there's no difference between "eat" and "eating"
 pluskid	but the meaning depends on the context
 n4nd0	not even eat and ate?
 pluskid	there will be words in the context to indicate whether "eat" or "eating"
 pluskid	but there are multiple tenses in Japanese
 pluskid	though Chinese and Japanese looks very similar, they are quite different actually
 pluskid	btw, shogun (the japanese word) is "jiang jun" in Chinese :p
 pluskid	the same characters, different pronounciations
 pluskid	and the same meaning
 n4nd0	curious
 sonne|work	uricamic: can you do any kind of benchmark for KRR?
 sonne|work	uricamic: and one more thing - could you create a *separate* pull request for the GS-KRR?
 uricamic	sonne|work: I plan to implement also the version which will not precompute the kernel matrix for large data. What kind of benchmark do you mean?
 sonne|work	uricamic: just measure if GS is faster than the pinv based one
 sonne|work	btw I would do it slightly differently
 uricamic	sonne|work: I have tried to create another pull request, but it didn't work
 sonne|work	gsomix, n4nd0, wiking, pluskid - please help uricamic with this :)
 pluskid	uricamic: are you in the mailing list?
 uricamic	is it possible that I can have only one opened pull request?
 uricamic	pluskid: yes
 pluskid	there was an email describing the work flow
 sonne|work	uricamic: I would just add a new train function to KRR
 shogun-buildbot	build #651 of octave_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/651  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 sonne|work	and the epsilon parameter
 wiking	!!!! sonne|work :>
 sonne|work	not create a new class for that - I mean the rest is the same :)
 pluskid	I think you have to create multiple branches to make multiple pull request
 sonne|work	wiking: I promise I didn't do anything!
 wiking	:))
 wiking	why did it fail now? :)
 sonne|work	something wrong with perceptron
 uricamic	sonne|work: ok, that sounds reasonable, I will change it
 sonne|work	a rhyme :)
 sonne|work	uricamic: yeah then one can have a 'master' train function that selects some selected solver that one can specify as arg to constructor
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't even see any error?!
 uricamic	pluskid: what was the subject of that email ?
 n4nd0	uricamic: yeah I agree with pluskid, you need multiple branches for multiple pull requests
 pluskid	uricamic: git workflow
 pluskid	uricamic: this link: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2537

 n4nd0	sonne|work: I got news
* sonne|work listens up
 sonne|work	n4nd0: what news?
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.4.7] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 n4nd0	sonne|work: so doing this upper bounded computation
 n4nd0	the time improves, but just a little bit
 n4nd0	before the construction time in shogun was like 5 times the one in standalone JL
* pluskid is trying some IRC command
 n4nd0	now it is sth between 4 and 5 times
* n4nd0 likes this IRC command :)
* pluskid thinks it cool, too
 n4nd0	the thing is that the distance function used in standalone JL is pretty optimized
 n4nd0	take a look
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uhSe9
 sonne|work	ahh ok
 n4nd0	the loop is unrolled I think
 n4nd0	the big issue is that it assumes that the dimension of the points is multiple of 8
 sonne|work	and it is based on floats
-!- pluskid [~chatzilla@li400-235.members.linode.com] has quit [Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.88.2 [Firefox 11.0/20120312181643]]
 n4nd0	does that make a big difference too?
 sonne|work	factor 2 at least
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so what do you think?
 sonne|work	we don't want to switch to float
 sonne|work	but all other speedups are welcome :)
 n4nd0	so since that implementation assumes that the dimension of the features is multiple of 8
 n4nd0	(if the points given are not, there is a function that pads them with zeroes)
 n4nd0	how would you handle that in shogun?
 xiangwang	hi, does shogun include the cutting-plane algorithms?
 n4nd0	xiangwang: hey! we have OCAS :)
 xiangwang	in which folder of classifier ? thanks
 n4nd0	classifier/svm I guess
 n4nd0	yeah I see it in classifier/svm/SVMOcas
 n4nd0	sonne|work: do you think it pays off to reallocate CFeatures* lhs and rhs to make them multiple of 8?
 n4nd0	could it be done in another way?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well one could use this algorithm for the multiple of 8 dims that fit and for the remainder the slow one
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I like that solution
 n4nd0	sonne|work: we document it, that is recommended to use covertree with multiples of 8 dimensions :)
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	I mean sth else
 sonne|work	one can do fast processing as long as there are blocks of 8 dims to process
 sonne|work	only for the remainder we use the slow method
 sonne|work	that is fast too so no problem
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	ok
-!- elango_ [~elango@92-244-6-194.customers.ownit.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	also, this can only be done for SimpleFeatures, can't be?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	so I think this should be a function in dot/simplefeatures then
 sonne|work	but hey covertree first then this speedup stuff :)
 n4nd0	all right
 n4nd0	avout the warnings before
 n4nd0	ups aBout
 sonne|work	yes?
 n4nd0	they're related with the other covertree so when I do a pull request with the new one
 n4nd0	that code disappears
 sonne|work	ok
 n4nd0	I mean, no need to fix them before right?
 sonne|work	looking forward to it then

 blackburn	sonne|work: hey now I understand you a little more with 10 hrs of sleeping for last 3 days :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: my suggestion is to add a flag/option for upper_bounded thing
 n4nd0	blackburn: if SimpleFeatures are provided then do the special one?
 blackburn	n4nd0: why features?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think this thing can only be done for SimpleFeatures
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uhSe9
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd it depends on distance rather than features
 n4nd0	but don't you think that the function I have posted can just be done if we have SimpleFeatures?
 n4nd0	we can upper bound for all ok (as long as Euclidian is used this far)
 n4nd0	but to do it with that unrolled loop and the multiples of 8
 blackburn	I mean some distances could provide that
 blackburn	and could not
 blackburn	sonne|work: can all these fancy string kernels/distances be upper bounded?
 blackburn	n4nd0: however you said it is not as fast as we expected with this upper bound?
 n4nd0	sorry I was afk
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is expected because it is not just the upper bound what makes JL faster but also the optimizations
 blackburn	n4nd0: loop unrollment?
 n4nd0	blackburn: probably
 n4nd0	sonne|work pointed out that the floats also, we use double
 blackburn	n4nd0: loop unrollment is dangerous thing to implement explicitly I think
 blackburn	we can't be sure it would be faster everywhere
 blackburn	and actually blas is unrolled so we should stick to blas I think
 n4nd0	but there we cannot cut the computation if the upper bound is passed right?
 blackburn	we can compute batches with blas
 blackburn	n4nd0: DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DNRM2(N,X,INCX)
 blackburn	could you please try that?
 blackburn	or SNRM2
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is pretty interesting how did they implement that http://www.netlib.org/blas/dnrm2.f
 n4nd0	blackburn: why don't you like just to implement that piece of code?
 n4nd0	I mean the distance used in JL
 blackburn	n4nd0: implement where?
 n4nd0	to optimize the distance computation for cover tree
 blackburn	check if it is faster than dnrm2 ;)
 n4nd0	how can dnrm2 be faster?
 n4nd0	don't you think this one is already very specific?
 blackburn	in which means?

-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	it looks like they have optimized the distance computation so it goes very fast here
 blackburn	I am still think we should stick to blas ;)
 blackburn	it is optimized as well
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: for example dnrm2 is more stable
 n4nd0	once I start to do this part of the optimization we can test it

 harshit_	also do you happen to have old svmlin library's example with you, their link is  broken in web
 harshit_	I sent a mail to vikas(author ) but no reply till now
 blackburn	no, I haven't
 harshit_	I think soeren might have it, coz he is author of svmlin in shogun ? Please ask him when he comes online, I may not be able to catch him.
 blackburn	sonne|work: ^
 harshit_	oh he is online !!
 blackburn	partially
 blackburn	but I am afraid he just merged it
 harshit_	what did he merge ??
 blackburn	svmlin to shogun's codebase
 harshit_	no no , I am not asking for its code, that is available. All I am asking for is its 'standard' examples,which are available in a separate archive which in not downloadable
 harshit_	Want to test shogun's TSVM and svmlin TSM on that dataset before proceeding
 blackburn	ah no idea
 harshit_	no problem, btw how to issue *(some message) on IRC ?
* blackburn this one?
 blackburn	 / me
 harshit_	yeah
 blackburn	without spaces
 harshit_	I cant see any thing

 pluskid	blackburn, have you looked at the LARS code?
 blackburn	pluskid: yes
 pluskid	any feedback?
 blackburn	ok not really I think it should be merged
 blackburn	I'll do that once I get to home
 pluskid	cool, thanks
 pluskid	any suggestions on what to work on next?
 pluskid	small ones
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	however not so small..
 pluskid	hmm, let's see what's it
 blackburn	pluskid: have you seen how did we organized multiclass machine?
 pluskid	no, haven't investigated that yet
 pluskid	any problems there?
 blackburn	yes as new multiclass machines (CS liblinear and multiclass ocas) are in multiclass
-!- xiangwang [~chatzilla@159.226.60.224] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn, pluskid: actually one could do the new subset stuff from heiko for oVo ?
 sonne|work	OvO :D
 blackburn	and are inherited from multiclass machine
 blackburn	sonne|work: oVo looks nice ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes it is the task too
 blackburn	sonne|work: my intention is to move larank and gmnp to multiclass
 sonne|work	yeah but first finalize what n4nd0 started no?
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is pretty unrelated
 blackburn	while that stuff was generic and solvers do not make use of it
 n4nd0	what is left from the part I did?
 blackburn	I'll finish that on this weekend
 blackburn	n4nd0: ovo subsetting
 blackburn	pluskid: so the task could be
 blackburn	to move larank to multiclass
* pluskid is listening
 blackburn	and adjust it accordingly
 pluskid	ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: didn't Heiko did that? I understood the thing that was left was to test if the results were now correct
 blackburn	n4nd0: remember there is no add_subset for labels and kernels?
 sonne|work	blackburn: but wouldn't he need it if he does other ECOC schemes?
 sonne|work	ahh labels
* pluskid waiting for you guys to arrive at a conclusion
 sonne|work	yes true that needs to be done
 sonne|work	too
 blackburn	pluskid: currently larank is derived from multiclasssvm
 pluskid	so we should make it derive from multiclass machine?
 blackburn	exactly
 blackburn	this can be done with rebasing multiclasssvm actually
 pluskid	ok, I'll try that
 pluskid	is multiclasssvm derived from multiclass machine?
 blackburn	that could be painful so just let me know if you don't like do such refactoring
 pluskid	yeah, I haven't read those code yet
 blackburn	no, multiclasssvm should be inherited from kernelmulticlassmachine I think
 blackburn	sonne|work: agree?
 pluskid	I'll try to look at it and ask here if I have problems :)

 pluskid	BTW: do we have publically available online doxygen doc
 pluskid	for our dev code?
 pluskid	latest code, automatically updated doc?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't quite remember it that much but I think I already did the thing for kernels
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes makes sense
 n4nd0	blackburn: https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/commit/01eb524f812fff9cc9380d269351f2835bc24b62
 sonne|work	pluskid: no
 sonne|work	but you can just run make doc
 pluskid	sonne|work, yes, but that makes my local repo dirty
 pluskid	:p
 pluskid	I mean git status shows some changed files in doc directory
 pluskid	when I compile the doc
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that what is left to do is if it is correctly working after Heiko's job
 pluskid	n4nd0, what you are talking about is that: what I intend to do is already done before?
 n4nd0	pluskid: no no, no worries
 n4nd0	pluskid: another thing
 pluskid	ok :)
 n4nd0	pluskid: another think that appeared in the conversation ;9
 blackburn	pluskid: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/refactor.jpg
 pluskid	got it
* n4nd0 has weak fingers for parentheses today
 pluskid	oops
 pluskid	have to connect a VPN to see files in dropbox
 blackburn	mad skillz painting loool
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha that explanation ^ is just awesome
 blackburn	damn did they block dropbox?
 pluskid	have you guys heard about the Great Fire Wall in China?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	yeah ...
 pluskid	they block many valuable sites
 pluskid	will be back in a while after a reconnection

 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	is it merged?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no
 blackburn	what is you waiting for ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think we decided to wait after Heiko'
 blackburn	ah
 pluskid	what is the refactor figure mean?
 pluskid	is this already done or waiting to be done?
 blackburn	that should be done
 blackburn	left (as is) => right (should be)
 pluskid	so they all become disconnected?
 blackburn	no my links were overlapped by package :D
 blackburn	structure is obvious
 blackburn	the only thing - multiclasssvm should inherit from multiclass
 pluskid	cool figure btw :)
 blackburn	I think we should make use of uml for such things - much easier to grasp

 karlnapf	exam preparation
 sonne|work	tough tough
 karlnapf	how are things?
 sonne|work	did you see that we got 9 slots?
 sonne|work	of which we will give back 1 due to not enough mentors?
 karlnapf	what? wow :)
 karlnapf	no not yet
 karlnapf	man
 karlnapf	awsome this is
 sonne|work	if 2/5th of them stay with us after GSoC we are in shogun heaven
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	very cool
 karlnapf	this will probably happen
 karlnapf	how many proposals were there in the end?
 sonne|work	48
 sonne|work	from 38 students
 sonne|work	still a lot
 sonne|work	probably a dozen w/o patch though
 sonne|work	(reject)
 karlnapf	indeed, very nice congratulations for the 9 slots
 karlnapf	whats next?
 karlnapf	ranking probably
 karlnapf	sonne|work, talk to you later got a meeting now. I will be around in the evening and on the weekend

 wiking	blackburn: have u ever worked with DomainAdaptationSVM?
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	planning to actually
 blackburn	are you going to try whole shogun? :)
 wiking	some stuff
 wiking	i'd like to test something
 wiking	i have a pretty well trained svm
 wiking	but for some images i don't have some features
 blackburn	at all?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	since some of the features are actually textual features
 wiking	that are not dependent on the image itself
 wiking	but where the image resided
 wiking	and i have some random images about which i have no other info
 wiking	so some features are basically missing
 wiking	and i was wondering if i could still
 wiking	classify those images
 blackburn	damn you have hard task :D
 wiking	this DomainAdaptationSVM
 wiking	seems to be something
 wiking	that is worth a shot
 blackburn	is it a multiclass problem you have?
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	would need to design new DA SVM then :D
 blackburn	how much time you have?
 wiking	yeah just realized from the code
 wiking	that actually it seems to be binary classifier
 blackburn	so no need to multiclass?
 wiking	i would
 wiking	but src/shogun/classifier/svm/DomainAdaptationSVM.h is binary right?
 wiking	mm yeah
 wiking	since it's derived from SVMLight
 wiking	damn i thought i could just use it out of box :)
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	:((
 blackburn	wiking: while this DA SVM was implemented by chris I can ask him
 blackburn	and we can come up with linear multiclass da svm
 blackburn	da svm lol
 wiking	:>
 wiking	yeah would be great to extend it
 wiking	mmm it has a kernelized version as well...
 blackburn	wiking: yes while it is dual
 blackburn	wiking: okay dinner time now and after I'll send chris a mail

 wiking	?
 wiking	cs =?
 blackburn	crammer singer
 blackburn	my favourite multiclass formulation with simple dual ;)
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	tell me tell me
 wiking	i make NOW :)
 blackburn	wiking: make what? ;)
 wiking	da with cs
 blackburn	I'm going to implement it once I formulate it
 blackburn	however that would be not so trivial

 wiking	w/o having a nvidia tesla
 blackburn	wiking: is the dataset so big?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	5*10^6 vectors with each of 64 dimension
 wiking	it was weird though
 wiking	had to do a *10^3 for each vector
 wiking	as otherwise gmm couldn't find any cluster centers
 wiking	so i don't know if on the end this is going to work out :)
 wiking	i'm still amazed by this tesla... now it's 116W is being used now when it's running on 100%
 blackburn	wiking: why not kmeans?
 wiking	blackburn: since i'm trying to generate some fisher vectors
 wiking	and i'd be interested as well in the soft clustering of gmm
 blackburn	wiking: I see
 blackburn	I just recalled there is an algorithm called ??????

 blackburn	wiking: idea of regularized DA svm is to
 blackburn	optimize 1/2 ||w-w0||^2 + C \sum_i \xi_i with same s.t.
 blackburn	w0 is SVM trained on source domain
 wiking	ah
 blackburn	and predictor is
 blackburn	<w,x>+<w0,x>
 blackburn	sounds reasonable but I need to think about it in MC mean

@sonney2k	blackburn, wiking well you can just use all the w_0 you obtained from the original training and learn new w's
 blackburn	sonney2k: how?
@sonney2k	so it is basically the same thing like two-class - one just chooses the corresponding w_0
@sonney2k	blackburn, I assume you do true MC
 blackburn	CS
@sonney2k	so you have one-vs-rest classification in the end
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem is:
 blackburn	min 1/2 ||w-w0||^2 + C ..
 blackburn	s.t. <w,x>-...
 blackburn	not w-w0
 blackburn	so it can't be 'virtual' w-w0

@sonney2k	not yet
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean dual task will change in that case
@sonney2k	min 0.5||w||^2 +0.5 ||w-w0||^2 + ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: and liblinear does not provide an easy way
 blackburn	wow what is it?
@sonney2k	same thing like you use
 blackburn	but grad will change
@sonney2k	by some constant
@sonney2k	IIRC there is some gamma or whatever factor in front of the second term
 blackburn	sonney2k: but still needs some patching there right?
@sonney2k	so you can scale gamma and get
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen I've got a competitor?
@sonney2k	0.5 ||w||^2 + gamma w^T w_0 + ...
@sonney2k	yes you need to do some patching
@sonney2k	in the same way liblinear is patched now for binary svm
@sonney2k	not just one :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: but one is going to contribute ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think following is reasonable then?
 blackburn	0.5 \sum_m ||w_m||^2 + gamma \sum_m wm^T w_0m + C \sum_i \xi_i
 blackburn	however I can hardly see what is the trade-off we want to achieve there
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the role of w^T w_0?
 blackburn	ah stupid question it is w-w0
@sonney2k	gtg

@sonney2k	blackburn, and the ||w0||^2 part is const so can be left out from objective
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes that's clear

@sonney2k	depends on value of gamma :)
