@iglesiasg	besser82, hello :)
@sonney2k	besser82, if I understand your plugin concept correctly
@sonney2k	(FYI to the others - that one http://blog.nuclex-games.com/tutorials/cxx/plugin-architecture/ )
@sonney2k	one would e.g. define CKernel as interface
@sonney2k	and then e.g. CGaussianKernel would be a .dll / .so?!
@sonney2k	What I don't get though is how cross connections are done
@sonney2k	like CKernel needs CFeatures
@wiking	i reckon that we could learn a lot from gstreamer arch

 besser82	sonney2k: every plugin can communicate with another one through the "interface-lib"
 besser82	sonney2k: I could imagine using plugins that way:
 besser82	having an interface-lib, which provides all (common-)stuff needing to deal with the "functional"-plugins
 besser82	that would be the ui-exposing interface, too.  like user writes his code using that interface, only
 besser82	the interface-lib looksup all avail plugins on init()
 besser82	and registers them to the plugin-manager
 besser82	which provides func-ptrs to the corrensponding plg's functions / methods
 besser82	all plugins need to interface that interface-lib in any way
 besser82	if one plugin needs to interact with another one this is made through the interface-lib as well...
 besser82	the if-lib then checks whether the req. plg is already loaded and if neccessary loads && inits it
 besser82	sonney2k, wiking:  ^^^
 besser82	so there is just one main interface, which doesn't have any "exotic" deps and provides the generic-stuff need for the user to interact
 besser82	that would solve the d-ptr stuff and some other things as well....
 besser82	iglesiasg, HeikoS:  ^^^

 besser82	will be back in ~5 mins  ---> router reboot
@iglesiasg	besser82, how do the if-lib and plugins communicate?
@iglesiasg	besser82, is everything solved at compile time, I mean all of these are libraries with headers to include and so on
@iglesiasg	besser82, or IPC?

@wiking	iglesiasg: no ipc...
@iglesiasg	ok!
@wiking	iglesiasg: dynamic lib (.so
@iglesiasg	I guess it was an stupid/insane question :D
@wiking	nono i'm just saying
@iglesiasg	all right gtg, catch you later

 besser82	sonney2k: btw. communication between the plugins could be done with Protobufs as well  ;)
@wiking	besser82: nooooo
 besser82	wiking: ???
@wiking	besser82: i hope that was just a joke about the protobuf's current state in shogun :)))0
 besser82	wiking: I just said "could be done", not is the *BEST* solution  ;)
@wiking	besser82: ok i've sent my 2 cents
@wiking	besser82: but basically i would really suggest to check on gstreamer on this manner
@wiking	*matter
@wiking	they did an awesome job for creating a plugin based media framework
@wiking	and they only had ansi c for doing it ;)
 besser82	wiking: yes, i did have a look on gstreamer and the work is nice, but...
@wiking	what's the but? :)
 besser82	wiking: since we are using C++11 things can be done a lot easier than just using ansi-c  ;)
@wiking	besser82: yeah sure i'm just saying that doing something similar or based on that
@wiking	would be highly adviseable
@wiking	as they are really working on this for 5+ years
@wiking	besser82: i know one of the core developers personally so i can even get him to tell us a bit about the pitfalls one might encounter
 besser82	wiking: that would be a nice idea  :D
 besser82	wiking: and one other thing about gstreamer is: It looks a bit overcomplicated to me, but that might be because of using pure ansi-c  ;)
@wiking	besser82: but i would really go with doing this in memory
@wiking	and not some library to do the communication among the different plugins
@wiking	besser82: well yeah ansi c makes everything a little bit more complicated... or let's say harder to read
 besser82	wiking: you're talking about the interface-lib?!?
 besser82	wiking: like in my proposal?
@wiking	besser82: but then again as u can see now the different plugins can be glued together automagically
 besser82	wiking: by "interface-lib" i refer to some lib, which is:
 besser82	the lib the user links against
 besser82	the lib providing the public interfaces
 besser82	the lib which has common data-structures used by all plugins
 besser82	wiking:  so I think, I basically meant the same, what those gstreamer-folks already did  ;)  But in the C++11-way
@wiking	well i wouldnt push c++11 that much
@wiking	as it'll take another 2 years to have compilers supporting that on many other systems...
@wiking	certenly we can do some ifdefs as it is now
 besser82	wiking:  all major compilers actually support c++11 quite well now  ;)  Clang, GCC, MSVC
 besser82	wiking:  shall we really care about exotics like HP-Ux?!?
@wiking	besser82: yeah the latest stable of those compilers...
@wiking	but not everybody has that on their system :P
 besser82	wiking: afaik all we need of c++11 in the "interface"-lib, should work from gcc 4.3+  or MSVC2009
 besser82	wiking: no sure about clang....
 besser82	wiking: but you can tell ;)
 besser82	wiking: so supporting the basic "c++0x"-features should be enough
 besser82	wiking: or shall we really care about people using up-to-date stuff like Internet Explorer for Mac?  :-P

@sonney2k	besser82, I still don't have a clear picture
@sonney2k	besser82, I guess I will only get one if we try this with some minimal code example
@sonney2k	but first things first
@sonney2k	we need to get cmake in shape and 3.1 out
