 blackburn	SHHHHH

 blackburn	unfortunately lle produces indefinite symmetrical matrix :(

@sonney2k	blackburn, without any hurt?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah reading using laptop suckz, aint it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but is this A4 size / I mean don't you need to zoom the pdf to read anything?
 blackburn	sonney2k: most papers have large margins - so easy readable
 CIA-32	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * rb0c3848 / (4 files): add distribution java examples - http://bit.ly/oqMg27
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r268bccc / (4 files):
 CIA-32	shogun: Merge pull request #185 from sploving/master
 CIA-32	shogun: add remaining distribution java examples - http://bit.ly/mY9Cbp
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok...
 blackburn	e.g. elements of statistical learning looks pretty without zoom
 blackburn	as is
@sonney2k	hmmhh... looks like things are progressing
 blackburn	which things?
@sonney2k	I should probably start test shogun compilation on osx / cygwin
 blackburn	I'm now trying to get causes of LLE strange results sometimes

@sonney2k	blackburn, that is actually also a good candidate for shogun http://mloss.org/software/view/320/
@sonney2k	all the possible multiclass svms...
 blackburn	sonney2k: where to get so much consistent developers? ;)
@sonney2k	consistent?
@sonney2k	did you mean where to get enough developers to support all the many features?
 blackburn	ehh sth like that
 blackburn	well where to get any developers? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, well year over year there must be another GSoC :)
 blackburn	yeah I hope to get into it ;)
* sonney2k looks at the mc svm code stuff
@sonney2k	interesting
@sonney2k	they have sse4.1 tuned dot products in there
 blackburn	hoho
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ maybe we should benchmark and borrow their code :)
 blackburn	well if it isn't a task for a 1.0 - I could do it some day
 blackburn	I should be 'vacant' for ~10 hours per week for some shoguning after gsoc
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we have some up-to-date multiclass svm now?
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have GMNPSVM
 blackburn	it tells me almost nothing :)
@sonney2k	and some one-vs-one via LibSVM
@sonney2k	but that's it
 blackburn	sonney2k: is there any not one-vs-one for SVMs?
@sonney2k	the one in the package were true MC SVMs
@sonney2k	GMNP*
 blackburn	how it works?
@sonney2k	and one-vs-rest one has to do manually currently
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is a true multiclass svm
 blackburn	I wonder how it can be formulated
@sonney2k	easy: you want f(x,y) for the true class y to be greater than f(x,y') for y' not the true class
@sonney2k	and f is a linear function again - but rest is the same as svm
@sonney2k	optimization problem is harder though
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean in SVM you usually just say points should be on the right side of the hyperplane
 blackburn	yeap
@sonney2k	now you say output of the function for the true label should be greater than output of the function for all wrong labels plus some margin
@sonney2k	so you have many more constraints
 blackburn	ah seems I understood
 blackburn	:( got dataset where LLE produces different results for different solvers
 blackburn	debug session #N
 blackburn	not stable problem I guess
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've finally changed everything to vim :) because of you!
@sonney2k	I am sorry
 blackburn	:D
-!- f-x [~user@117.192.203.242] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it is cool, I understand, I guess you (with some experience and skillz) use it almost magically
@sonney2k	I don't even use all the features.
@sonney2k	but I got very used to it now...
@sonney2k	do you know whether eclipse has a vim plugin?
@sonney2k	http://eclim.org/
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, eclipse have one, I know
@sonney2k	very good
@sonney2k	if I ever have to use eclipse I can at least feel home :)
 bettyboo	:)
 blackburn	for java I consider ide ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it *normal* in ML that some methods can fail if say k is bad?
@sonney2k	blackburn, welcome to numerics
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	e.g. LLE sometimes produces examples lying on diagonal line
 blackburn	not that beauty I showed you yesterday
@sonney2k	some methods are very sensitive
@sonney2k	some very robust
 blackburn	I'll check it for sure - but looks like it is not robust
 blackburn	sparse matrix eigenproblem doesn't look robust for me, am I right?
 blackburn	voices in my head tells me it is not, sonney2k, do you have any?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not an expert in this subject but I would guess so :)
 blackburn	me too, but voices.. :D
 blackburn	scikit-learn started as GSoC project?!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am currently checking java examples
@sonney2k	Isomap preprocessor = new Isomap()
@sonney2k	gives an error
@sonney2k	does it not exist or has it a different name?
 blackburn	sonney2k: isomap is abstract class
 blackburn	ClassicIsomap or LandmarkIsomap
 blackburn	better both :D
@sonney2k	yes that works
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw, did you touch / polish kernelpca / pca?
 blackburn	not yet
 blackburn	arpack issues..
@sonney2k	I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, good luck :)
 blackburn	now writing to jake vanderplas, he have implemented lle in scikits
 blackburn	I really warned with some unstability
