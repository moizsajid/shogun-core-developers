@sonney2k	blackburn, around?

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh so we missed each other again
@sonney2k	anyway I have the following proposal (hopefully you will read this in the logs)
@sonney2k	I would try to change anything that returns a vector / sets a vector as follows:
@sonney2k	SGVector get_FOO();
@sonney2k	void set_FOO(SGVector* vec);
@sonney2k	question is whether get_FOO() should return a ptr
@sonney2k	I wouldn't want to use any pointers!

 blackburn	sonney2k: here :)
 blackburn	SGVector get_FOO();
 blackburn	you mean it should return an instance?
 blackburn	but what about it's matrix 'nature'?
 blackburn	i.e. when we call get_FOO() we often just get pointer to some part of matrix and so on

 dave718	hahaha
 dave718	I was wondering, are there any example files that are compatible with RealFileFeatures?  I've tried to build one myself according to what's in the source code but still not working properly.
 dave718	(and just out of curiosity, how much memory will be used when training/testing on RealFileFeatures + how much of a performance hit should I expect in general?)

@sonney2k	blackburn, with matrix same thing
@sonney2k	you get a copy of the SGMatrix structure
@sonney2k	so a copy of the pointer and the matrix dimensions
 blackburn	aaaaaah
 blackburn	a copy of pointer!
@sonney2k	so
@sonney2k	SGMatrix get_FOO();
 blackburn	but what is the problem? I think copy of pointer should work good
@sonney2k	and
@sonney2k	void set_FOO(SGMatrix x)
@sonney2k	OK?
 blackburn	I think it is ok
 blackburn	why not?
 blackburn	moreover
 blackburn	in jblas guys had some problems because of 'voidness' of getters
 blackburn	as seen on mailing list
 blackburn	it could solve it, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes I hope
 blackburn	yeah, so I like it
 blackburn	ah! no goal :(
@sonney2k	the only problem is that it is hard to understand for java people who would expect just a reference to the struct
 blackburn	why? it looks just like any java object
 blackburn	or may be I don't understand what you mean for sure
 blackburn	* 1-1 !! yeah!
@sonney2k	blackburn, in java you only get a reference to an object - here it is a direct copy...
@sonney2k	blackburn, java would be returning a ptr aka ref
* blackburn is celebrating russia goes to 1/2
 blackburn	aha, I see
 blackburn	I think the way it is now - e.g. float64_t* vec, int32_t len - isn't more convenient
@sonney2k	that is out of question
@sonney2k	:D
 blackburn	so the question only related to point or not to point? :)
 blackburn	modern shakespeare
@sonney2k	pointing to a SGVector struct could be problemeatic
 blackburn	soooo?
@sonney2k	I mean we would have to allocate the struct with new[]
@sonney2k	and delete[] it
@sonney2k	ok so I will do the return copy thing as a test
@sonney2k	lets see
 blackburn	yeap, I think that will work
* blackburn today finally sent scans of tax and enrollment forms to google
@sonney2k	ok so we have a plan - but I don't have time to implement it right now *sigh*
@sonney2k	l8r
 blackburn	see you :)
