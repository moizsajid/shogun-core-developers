@wiking	besser82: i think i'm done :)
@wiking	although i do not really understand it works now but not the other way round but at least now it's good
@wiking	check the last commit diff
@wiking	no more -D...
@wiking	so we could actually merge this
@besser82	wiking, lemme have a look =)
@besser82	looks good so far...  locally building
@besser82	ccache kicks it really fast now =)
@besser82	then doing the whole-thing <tm> with rpmbuild and see where it leads...
@besser82	if it's fine, I'll rebase && annotated merge-in
@besser82	wiking, ^
@besser82	" -DSWIG2_CSHARP -DSWIGWORDSIZE64 "  :(
@besser82	I'll bring that into swig_config.h...
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	sorry about that
@besser82	np  ;)
@wiking	ah one more thing missing i think
@besser82	just seen it, when generating python_mod
@besser82	which one?
@wiking	noup nothing
@wiking	ok
@wiking	can u move those into swig_config.h ?
@wiking	and then try the rpmbuild
@wiking	see if it all green
@besser82	sure =)
@wiking	then we still miss the whole "install modular without building libshogun" thingy
@besser82	next step after merge  ;)
@besser82	can do it within next 2 or 3 days
@wiking	gr8
@wiking	besser82: the travis was all 100%
@wiking	so i think it'll be fine
@besser82	think so too...  ;)
@wiking	btw how would u do that
@wiking	i mean the modular only build?
@wiking	with a configure flag?
@besser82	think so...  some cmake -D...=ON and a bit cmake magick then
@wiking	cool
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	ccache is great now
@wiking	it's working finally i must say :)
@wiking	mmm ihave to fix some stuff with viennacl
@wiking	but yeah if this works out good let's merge it asap
@wiking	because of ccache :)
@besser82	just made the changes... rebuilding... if works pushing...
@besser82	wiking, shall I rebase on current develop, before pushing?
@besser82	you can get the "new" commit locally then by `git fetch --all --prune` and git reset --hard oring/feature/config.h
@besser82	git reset --hard origin/feature/config.h
@wiking	yep yep
@wiking	push it :>
@besser82	just a minute...

@wiking	besser82: \o/
@wiking	besser82: time for me to fix some of the bots
@besser82	wiking, think so  ;)
@wiking	python3 seems a problem
@wiking	just some integration stuff
@wiking	and as well the octave header is another minor problem i think
@besser82	wiking, but reset --hard your local branch to develop first  ;)
@wiking	how about the c# thing
@besser82	that's next to ivestigate on my list
@wiking	yeah i think there we need a lot of refactor
@besser82	thinks so too :(
@besser82	much work
