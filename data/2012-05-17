 n4nd0	is there any reason why CList is not made with template?
 blackburn	n4nd0: some serialization issue I am afraid
 blackburn	but I am not sure
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I think it would be more comfortable with templates
 n4nd0	not so many casts when returning elements for example
 blackburn	n4nd0: try to ask soeren once he is online
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'll do that, thanks ;)

 emrecelikten	Hello all
 blackburn	hi
 emrecelikten	Stumbled upon this: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/code.html
 blackburn	hah yeah that cat is cute

 sonney2k	emrecelikten, heh :)
 emrecelikten	Might be useful in future I guess
 emrecelikten	Not the cat :P
 sonney2k	not until you did a fft^-1
 emrecelikten	sonney2k: :D
 blackburn	is anybody aware of fourier features usage in CV?
 sonney2k	n4nd0, YMMV. it used to be template based but IMHO it is much more clean to use SGObject as the required base, since you know you can do SG_REF/UNREF
 sonney2k	but I agree lots of casting...
 blackburn	sonney2k: when did you plan next meeting?
 sonney2k	check the logs 2x.05.

@sonney2k	blackburn, I've changed all the label stuff - but one question pops up. what shall classifiers output?
@sonney2k	I mean BinaryLabels, MulticlassLabels, Regressionlabels
@sonney2k	are all specific
 blackburn	sonney2k: hehe depends whether you did add some base class there
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	iirc it is ok to specialize class in descendant
 blackburn	then you will have to make apply class specific..
@sonney2k	well we have CLabels as base class
@sonney2k	but it won't help us
 blackburn	why not?
@sonney2k	because from python labels will be an abstract class
@sonney2k	like features
 blackburn	sonney2k: as I can see the only way is to move apply to specific machines
@sonney2k	so I only see two solutions: RealvaluedLabels or OutputLabels
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean binarymachine?
@sonney2k	multiclassmachine?
@sonney2k	regressionmachine?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes binary machine, multiclass machine all has they own apply
@sonney2k	makes sense
@sonney2k	so Machine would loose its 'apply' interface function
@sonney2k	only problem I see is that we have kernel machine
@sonney2k	and that can be binary.mc, regression
@sonney2k	any of it
 blackburn	KernelBinaryMachine..
@sonney2k	same w/ linear
 blackburn	yeah..
@sonney2k	blackburn, not so easy because e.g. SVRLight derives from SVMLight
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	so I would rather suggest to remove apply() from CMachine
@sonney2k	and then introduce some type specific apply to the machines we have
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is the diff?
 blackburn	where*
 blackburn	sonney2k: SVR/SVM can be solved I think - we can merge regression and binary labels
@sonney2k	blackburn, which name do you prefer: DenseOutputLabels, RealvaluedLabels, ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: dense?
 blackburn	no not dense
 blackburn	RealLabels is ok I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: we should think about multiple outputs here..
@sonney2k	blackburn, I currently have regression labels - which would be the same as RealLabels
@sonney2k	I think I would keep them though
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, why?
@sonney2k	because it is obvious that you want regression labels for regression, mc labels of mc, binary for binary classifiers...
 blackburn	true
 blackburn	but I am ok with real labels and multiclass labels
 blackburn	not binary, regression and mc I mean
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need binary... I mean otherwise there is no way to check if labels are just +1/-1
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is an advantage of real as binary - we can train on outputs of machine
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am talking about inputs
@sonney2k	outputs will only be RealLabels
 blackburn	oh different classes?
 blackburn	input/output?
@sonney2k	yes of course
@sonney2k	for binary we really prefer real valued outputs
@sonney2k	we can add a constructor to binary labels that converts from real valued ones though
@sonney2k	splitting at default threshold 0
@sonney2k	btw for multiclass I would also want to have some function that returns the outputs of all the sub-machines
@sonney2k	real-valued...
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have used some OvR ROC/PRC/F1/Recall/Precision measures - do you think it should be added to evals too?
@sonney2k	blackburn, for multi-output labels we should have a separate classes ...
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw what was the issue with auROC?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you had auROC=1.0 but accuracy <1
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is possible
@sonney2k	how?
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	bia
@sonney2k	s
@sonney2k	so no bug?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm no idea but it is
 blackburn	no no bug I compared with other impl
 blackburn	of you I guess?
 blackburn	in mldata utils
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is bias here?
@sonney2k	simple example is add + 1000 to all classifications
@sonney2k	auROC will stay correct
@sonney2k	100%
@sonney2k	accuracy will drop
 blackburn	hmm why?
@sonney2k	to 0 I guess
 blackburn	I admit I do not fully understand role of ROC
@sonney2k	because sign(output+100000) -> +1 for everything
 blackburn	okay so ROC is TPR/FPR
@sonney2k	for all possible bias terms
@sonney2k	so independent of bias
@sonney2k	auROC
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah so neither TPR nor FPR is not changed, right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: will the graph change at all?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	same thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: sounds pretty useless
@sonney2k	what sounds useless?
 blackburn	sonney2k: roc
@sonney2k	why?
@sonney2k	imho accuracy is useless
@sonney2k	because it depends on bias
 blackburn	sonney2k: quality is pretty bad but auROC is ok..
@sonney2k	quality is actually superb
@sonney2k	you should never trust the bias a machine outputs
@sonney2k	but adjust it to what you want later
@sonney2k	(wanted fpr or tpr)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so only b term is to be adjusted then?
 blackburn	sonney2k: cool wisdom hehe
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: my ROC/PRC analysis led to some interesting results in my multiclass task
 blackburn	I found that one class really sucks hehe
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/00000_00001.png
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the sign? :D :D
@sonney2k	no cows :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: traffic light ahead
 blackburn	I have absolutely no idea how to recognize something what I can't recognize w/o prior :D
@sonney2k	yeah no...
@sonney2k	too tough
@sonney2k	blackburn, CSupervisedKernelLocalTangentSpaceAlignment - does it need binary or MC features?
@sonney2k	err labels
 blackburn	sonney2k: it needs to be removed
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: *really* useless
 blackburn	and makes no sense at all
@sonney2k	that doesn't answer the question
@sonney2k	binary or mc?
 blackburn	sonney2k: mc but I will remove it anyway
 blackburn	sonney2k: let me better remove it now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean dim reducition is generally crappy
 blackburn	but it is really really useless shit
 blackburn	I just wanted to remove it once I am done with libedrt things
 blackburn	done
 CIA-113	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf1d5d22 / (4 files in 2 dirs): Removed SKLTSA algorithm - http://git.io/k40L9g
 blackburn	in the end I believe it was mistake to add it :D
 blackburn	same effect can be obtained with custom distance - but it is still totally useless to do that in that tangent mean
 blackburn	where are students?
 wiking	where
 blackburn	heh
 shogun-buildbot	build #836 of python_static is complete: Failure [failed test test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/836  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	no space left? cool
