 mikeling	Hi, when I try to use CMath::fequals like CMath::fequals<T>(vector[i], other.vector[i], accuracy, tolerant), the compiler tells me** cannot convert 'const std::__1::complex<double>' to 'float64_t' (aka 'double') without a conversion operato**
 mikeling	but it will pass if I change **T** to specific type like "float" or "double"
 mikeling	what should I do if I want to use template class to call equals?
 mikeling	s equals/fequals
