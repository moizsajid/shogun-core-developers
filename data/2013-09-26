 sonne|work	link
 wiking	hehehe funny
 wiking	anyhow i'll cleanup the ipynbs now
 wiking	and try to fix protoc
 sonne|work	wiking: btw lisitsyn wrote the gdb test run when sth fails but he had to comment it again
 wiking	where's the PR?
 wiking	or is there a pr?
 sonne|work	wiking: merged
 sonne|work	wiking: let me show you the lines
 wiking	ok cool

 sonne|work	wiking: hurray!
 sonne|work	wiking: ah sry got distracted
 sonne|work	wiking:  check cmake/checkgdb.cmake
 sonne|work	wiking: this is called from  tests/integration/python_modular/CMakeLists.txt
 sonne|work	wiking: it seems gdb is run on each example when this is activated
 sonne|work	no idea if the return code check is correct
 sonne|work	wiking: but I need this for libshogun examples / unit tests
 sonne|work	otherwise debugging cyg1 failures is too tough
 wiking	ok i'll check

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Dump gmock version to 1.7.0
 sonne|work	wiking: so w/ gmock we can drop the shitty svn dependency right?
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh btw I got the green light from json-c people that they would accept a patch for the nan / inf issue
 wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: well for gmock?
 wiking	it's done
 wiking	see my last commit
 sonne|work	wiking: didn't we have to svn checkout before
 sonne|work	wiking: yes exactly
 wiking	sonne|work: u didn't need to do anything...
 wiking	it was automatic
 wiking	but now it doesn't use svn
 wiking	but the zip
 sonne|work	yeah exactly
 wiking	but u never needed to svn checkout manually
 sonne|work	it is great
 wiking	let's see what the bots say
 sonne|work	well we needed svn installed
 wiking	yes for test
 sonne|work	but now no longer which is like ... great!
 wiking	but whoever did utest that it was highly likely that they had svn
 wiking	as svn is not dead... yet
 wiking	there's a problem with hdf5 + floatmax...
 sonne|work	no way to save it
 wiking	then we should just disable it i thnk
 sonne|work	it should just err or save as double
 sonne|work	disable what?
 wiking	H5T_NATIVE_LDOUBLE
 sonne|work	ahh cool
 wiking	Serialization.Hdf5_scalar_equal_FLOATMAX
 sonne|work	then
 wiking	but still this sucks
 sonne|work	what sucks?
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/NkVuAdYf
 wiking	and xml is even worse http://pastebin.com/5JUhE5js
 sonne|work	wiking: lzma auto decoder?!
 wiking	dunno
 wiking	this is what i get from valgrind
 sonne|work	wiking: looks very much like a bug in libxml
 sonne|work	wiking: but lbxml2_xzread ?!?
 sonne|work	we don't even use compression... looks like libxml2 supports this now
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but still it's loaded by libxml2
 wiking	it seems

 sonne|work	wiking: yeah maybe it needs to call some kind of cleanup
 sonne|work	once done
 sonne|work	but doesn't
 sonne|work	or we need to...
 sonne|work	no idea
 wiking	yeah the funny thing is that xmlcleanup is being called
 wiking	but i'll try to figure it out

-!- lisitsyn1 [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 wiking	ok somebody even created a supression file for this
 wiking	https://github.com/kitanda/hedgr/blob/master/build/valgrind/hedgr.supp
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: it looks we need to postpone meeting to next week
 lisitsyn1	thoralf and heiko are out so
 wiking	so i guess it's really some false positive error...
 wiking	sonne|work: actually what happened with that valgrind supression file that thoralf created?
 wiking	ok so release only next week then i guess?
 wiking	it sounds better as we still need some more time
 lisitsyn1	wiking: deffs not this week
 wiking	sonne|work: we need to change a bit how the notebooks are generated
 wiking	sonne|work: as some of the notebooks use data
 wiking	sonne|work: and if they are not present then the notebook is basically useless
 wiking	i'll put this into issue
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	btw doc/Doxyfile should not be in repo, or?
 wiking	i mean because of the version number etc...
 wiking	it should be generated with make doc
 wiking	mmm maaaaybe we should port as well the doxygen doc generation to cmake :P

 wiking	besser82: here?
 besser82	wiking: sure!
 besser82	wiking: What's the beef?
 wiking	besser82: CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE
 besser82	wiking: What precisely?
 wiking	can i set this from CMakeLists.txt?
 wiking	i mean apparently not
 besser82	wiking: What do you want to do exacly? can you be a bit more verbose, please?
 wiking	besser82: i want to set the valgrind suppression file for cmake
 wiking	i mean ctest
 wiking	i.e. when u run: ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck
 wiking	then it'll add the suppression file that is under configs/
 wiking	and there's a CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE but i dont know how it should be set properly
 besser82	wiking: you should put that into CTestConfig.cmake
 wiking	besser82: tried... doesn't work
 besser82	wiking: How did you set?
 wiking	besser82: SET(CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE ${CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}/configs/valgrind.supp)
 besser82	wiking: that should be correct so far....
 besser82	wiking: but it doesn't use it?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	when i run this:
 wiking	ctest -D ExperimentalMemCheck -V -R unit
 wiking	Memory check command: /usr/bin/valgrind "-q" "--tool=memcheck" "--leak-check=yes" "--show-reachable=yes" "--workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes" "--num-callers=50"
 wiking	316: MemCheck command: /usr/bin/valgrind "-q" "--tool=memcheck" "--leak-check=yes" "--show-reachable=yes" "--workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes" "--num-callers=50" "/home/wiking/shogun/build/tests/unit/shogun-unit-test" "--gtest_filter=MultipleProcessors.*"
 wiking	as u see suppression is not set at all
 besser82	wiking: did you find_program(CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND NAMES valgrind)  ?
 wiking	besser82: valgrind works...
 wiking	it's not the problem
 wiking	the problem is that in DartConfiguration.tcl MemoryCheckSuppressionFile is still empty
 besser82	wiking: have re-run cmake on an empty build-dir?
 besser82	and treid?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	been there done that
 wiking	ok
 wiking	it's totally different
 wiking	figured it out thnx
 wiking	it's         file(TO_CMAKE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/configs/valgrind.supp" MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE)
 wiking	in the CMakeLists.txt
 besser82	wiking: ???
 besser82	wiking: you need to set this im CMakeLists.txt ???
 wiking	besser82: yep
 wiking	and it works
 besser82	wiking: strange and weird  :S
 wiking	well still that's the way it actually sets the right file in DartConfiguration.tcl
 wiking	ok this is weird
 wiking	the MemoryCheckSuppressionFile is only set in DartConfiguration.tcl if i run cmake twice
 wiking	after the first run it's not set
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	i guess it needs to be in the cache
 wiking	:P

 hushell	May I ask a question guys? I refactored a class, but the python modular still look for a delete function: modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx: In function 'PyObject* _wrap_SOSVMHelper_add_primal(PyObject*, PyObject*)':
@HeikoS	wiking: no its not as you say it on my machines.
@HeikoS	wiking: make test runs fine and fast until nr. 97 from which every one takes 70 secs
 hushell	I have 'make clean', but doesn't helpful
@HeikoS	but python tester.py is fast
@HeikoS	hushell: try deleting the file
@HeikoS	hushell: build/src/interface/python_modular/modshogun*.cxx
 hushell	HeikoS: I tried, rm modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx
 wiking	HeikoS: have u pull the last commit?
@HeikoS	hushell: and you might also have to delete /usr/local/include/shogun
@HeikoS	hushell: thats a known issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1655
@HeikoS	wiking: let me try
@HeikoS	wiking: when did you push?
@HeikoS	do I need to re-run anything?
 hushell	I thought might be it looks for system directory, so I first make without python_modular and make install
@HeikoS	hushell: no its the local isntallation
@HeikoS	hushell: remove it, and doa new build, then this will be gone
 hushell	okay, let me try :)
 hushell	HeikoS: Thanks!
@HeikoS	wiking: ah cool, your patch solved the form97 issue
@HeikoS	wiking: lol, the model-selection tests that take so long to run do not output anything, so the test always passes if the program doenst crash
