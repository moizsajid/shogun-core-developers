 gsomix	hi
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey there?
@sonney2k	got time to party?
@sonney2k	wiking, could you please try to compile on osx with HAVE_ATLAS set in .config to see if this would already work?
 wiking	sonney2k: that will not work
 wiking	sonney2k: i've tried... there are several function calls that are missing from the accelerator framework
 wiking	that's why i've added that or macro in sgvector
@sonney2k	wiking, ok then

 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
 gsomix	sonney2k, I'm slowpoke... there is python3 support in matplotlib.

 wiking	sonney2k: here?
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
 wiking	sonney2k: copy ctor of sgvector
 wiking	i mean the problem is that what if i really want to make a copy of a vector?
@sonney2k	wiking, clone()
@sonney2k	we should really try to never copy by default
@sonney2k	and create some clone() method if we want a clone
@sonney2k	(that holds for all shogun objects)
@sonney2k	wiking, ok?
 wiking	sonney2k: okey
 wiking	ok then i'll change a bit the memcpy part
 wiking	i wonder if cblas_dcopy is faster than an optimizied memcpy
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	shouldn't be
@sonney2k	wiking, did you ever benchmark memcpy? I highly question that this is faster than a simple for loop
@sonney2k	for example I did a comparison with a 'highly optimized' sse based assembly version and gcc's default result with march=native was exactly as good

 blackburn	sonney2k: gcc's default version?
 blackburn	they call sse stuff if possible I think
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: naywhayare
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but memcopy is likely to be compiled/optimized for some generic linux box
@sonney2k	so a lib function is likely slower than a march=native tuned for loop - but hey I didn't try but I would be surprised if this is not the case
@sonney2k	for example atlas in ubuntu is damn slow
@sonney2k	compiling atlas locally gives you an order of magnitude speedup
