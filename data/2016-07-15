 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeap
 sanuj	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3370
 lisitsyn	looks good
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we need to discuss how to proceed further
 sanuj	for both tags and plugins

 lisitsyn	sanuj: I think at some point we need to bridge the gap
 lisitsyn	so plugins are loaded automatically
 lisitsyn	you just ask
 lisitsyn	give me mockplugin::mockclass
 sanuj	lisitsyn, like what is the process of adding a new plugin in shogun
 lisitsyn	don't know yet
 sanuj	and for create()
 lisitsyn	we've got to figure that out
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i think we should have a new dir for plugins dir
 sanuj	and cmake should just build .so for each plugin dir in new dir
 lisitsyn	yeah kind of
 sanuj	if someone wants to add plugin, just add it to the new plugins dir
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but i'm concerned about how to transition current shogun to plugins-tags parameter shogun
 sanuj	i mean, how to begin transitioning
