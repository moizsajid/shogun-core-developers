 n4nd0	the data one
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	well nevermind I get it bakc
 n4nd0	sorry about that :S

 CIA-39	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r122079a / data : Restored data - http://git.io/8Pl5mA
 n4nd0	I think I do something wrong with the submodule
 n4nd0	because my git status shows always
 n4nd0	#modified:   data (untracked content)
 blackburn	what is the output of git status in that dir?
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/TQvfuw66
 n4nd0	I don't want to put that file toy/hmsvm_data.mat in the main repo so I will delete it
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	that's the reason
 n4nd0	now I just get
 n4nd0	# On branch master
 n4nd0	# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
 n4nd0	#
 n4nd0	nothing to commit (working directory clean)
 n4nd0	mmm but my last two commits are the same as the ones in shogun-data master

 n4nd0	blackburn: thanks, now everything is fine :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you have a formulation of HM-SVM somewhere?
 blackburn	primal
 blackburn	or is it only primal?
 n4nd0	the optimization problem is the one used in generic SO
 blackburn	loss?
 n4nd0	the one in particular of the HM-SVM or the generic one?
 n4nd0	for the HM-SVM we use Hamming loss
 n4nd0	just count the number of elements that are different in two sequences of states
 n4nd0	for the generic one we are using the Hinge loss
 blackburn	n4nd0: so we need subgradient of hamming loss, right?
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean for the risk function?
 blackburn	exactly
 n4nd0	I am not sure about that

 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	the last thing I got from was an exactly
 n4nd0	I don't know if you got what I said after
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you seen that pic?
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	ah I see you +1 that
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	I wanted to see how puffin look like
 blackburn	seems to be that his 5 kg notebook made him strong
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay
 blackburn	about subgrad
 blackburn	did you receive these messages?
 n4nd0	which one?
 blackburn	(02:21:40 AM) blackburn: n4nd0: for a function h subgradient is a vector g
 blackburn	(02:21:52 AM) blackburn: such that for all w following holds true
 blackburn	(02:22:08 AM) blackburn: h(w') >= h(w) + g(w'-w)
 blackburn	(02:22:10 AM) blackburn: right?
 blackburn	n4nd0: are you out again?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	I am here
 blackburn	n4nd0: so in HM-SVM primal is just
 blackburn	l2 of w + hamming loss
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	the loss is not l2, it is the hinge loss
 n4nd0	something similar to hinge loss to tell the truth, just max(0,z)
 n4nd0	and it is not taken to w directly
 blackburn	ehmm I didn't say l2 loss
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	is regularizer ||w||^2_2?
 n4nd0	what do you mean with l2 of w + hamming loss then?
 n4nd0	where?
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	in your hm-svm :)
 blackburn	how do you define risk at all?
 n4nd0	as they say in the paper :)
 blackburn	yeah that's what I am begging for :D
 blackburn	is that a paper? http://www.cs.brown.edu/~th/papers/AltTsoHof-ICML2003.pdf
 blackburn	the paper
 blackburn	I mean
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I understand it as a mean value of the loss function
-!- zxtx [~zv@c-71-227-187-90.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	expected value transmits better the idea I think
 blackburn	n4nd0: eq 18, right?
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn	which one?
 n4nd0	that is the objective
 n4nd0	in that paper they do not talk about risk functions
 n4nd0	that definition pops up from a more general point of view, in generic SO
 blackburn	objective is the risk
 blackburn	if we put s.t. part to the objective I mean
 n4nd0	but those are the constraints, not the objective
 blackburn	we can put it into objective and get a risk function
 n4nd0	http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume6/tsochantaridis05a/tsochantaridis05a.pdf
 n4nd0	page 4
 n4nd0	that is the formal definition of the risk function
 n4nd0	I don't really see the equivalence you say :S
 n4nd0	putting the constraints in the objective to get the risk function
 blackburn	risk is regularizer+loss
 blackburn	binary svm can be seen as
 n4nd0	aham maybe that is another definition then
 blackburn	||w||^2+max(0,1-y*<w,x>)
 blackburn	right?
 blackburn	w/o s.t part at all
 n4nd0	what I understood following this paper is that the risk is a measure of expected value of the loss
 n4nd0	let's see what Michal has done
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, it is an empirical risk
 blackburn	we optimize regularized risk
 shogun-buildbot	build #347 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/347  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 blackburn	that's objective w/o s.t. part
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: expected value is an actual risk
 blackburn	n4nd0: one interesting point here
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you know why one should introduce slack variable here?
 n4nd0	to penalize how far we go from the region of correct classification
 blackburn	n4nd0: I mean why not to make it use hinge loss as is?
 n4nd0	what do you mean with hinge loss as is?
 blackburn	max(0,1-yz)
 n4nd0	because in structured output, how do you define y?z?
 n4nd0	y is not a number any more
 blackburn	no, I don't mean that
 blackburn	in typical svm
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	why do we introduce s.t. part
 blackburn	but not use max(0,1-yz) in objective?
 n4nd0	you in typical svm you mean
 blackburn	just binary
 n4nd0	min ||w||^2 +  \sum_i slack_i
 blackburn	svm without s.t. part
 blackburn	is
 blackburn	min ||w||^2 + \sum_i max(0,1-y_i(<w,x_i>+b))
 blackburn	agree?
 n4nd0	agree
 blackburn	no s.t. part at all
 blackburn	right? :)
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	why not to solve that?
 n4nd0	that is non linear
 blackburn	yeah discontinuous I would say
 n4nd0	because of the max
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 blackburn	that's what I mean
 blackburn	but actually
 blackburn	that thing I wrote
 blackburn	is the regularized risk of svm
 blackburn	it can be solved via bmrm already
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 n4nd0	mmm not really
 blackburn	so in your hm-svm thing
 blackburn	you have
 blackburn	min ||w||^2 + hamming(what?)
 n4nd0	it is not directly like that
 blackburn	can we come to that?
 n4nd0	in generic SO we have
 n4nd0	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/shogun/so.pdf
 n4nd0	look at equation (1)
 n4nd0	so-svm with margin rescaling
 n4nd0	now
 n4nd0	the l we are using is this modified hinge loss, i.e. max(0,z)
 blackburn	no, for generic so we can't come up with subgradient at all I am afraid
 n4nd0	yeah but substitute the missing pieces there for what I am telling you
 n4nd0	and \Delta is the Hamming loss
 blackburn	that's clear
 blackburn	what are s.t. statements?
 blackburn	can we get rid of it?
 n4nd0	just some very generic constraints
 n4nd0	sonme of them are actually required
 n4nd0	forget about those there in the paper
 n4nd0	and the ones we really need are A?x <= b
 blackburn	what is A and b?
 shogun-buildbot	build #348 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/348  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	note that I use x and not w (x = [w auxiliary_variables slacks])
 n4nd0	still here?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	they have several uses
 n4nd0	one of them is particular to the cutting-plane algorithm I use
 n4nd0	another one is for the hm-svm, to specify monotonicity in the emission functions learnt
 blackburn	n4nd0: I got back to teo thesis
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	Appendix A.1 - isn't that what you need?
 n4nd0	that is not telling me how to compute the risk in an hmm
 blackburn	n4nd0: your loss is eq (A.2), subgradient is (A.8)
 blackburn	risk is loss value + regularizer value
 blackburn	n4nd0: can you compute loss function value?
 n4nd0	I think that the regularizer is not included in the risk
 blackburn	yeah I tend to that too
 blackburn	in that method it is I mean
 blackburn	generally it is included
 n4nd0	at the beginning of the bmrm, in the definition they give, it is not included I think
 blackburn	generally I mean in ML at all :)
 blackburn	I expect they regularize by L2
 n4nd0	ok :)
 n4nd0	anyway they do not include it in Teo either
 n4nd0	(A.2) for Teo is the loss (as you said) but it is also the risk
 blackburn	risk is sum of losses, yes
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	or average (depending on the implementation, I don't know exactly)
 blackburn	but it is not the issue right now
 n4nd0	agree
 blackburn	with A.8
 blackburn	you can compute subgradient
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	all you would need is to compute argmax in A.7
 blackburn	is it a hard task for hm-svm?
 n4nd0	the subgradient of the loss
 n4nd0	it is simply Viterbi
 n4nd0	I already have that one there
 blackburn	I am lame with markov models still but once you compute it you have everything you need
 n4nd0	I think I start to see your point :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: but you would need to run viterbi quite a few times, is it feasible?
-!- zxtx [~zv@c-71-227-187-90.hsd1.wa.comcast.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
 blackburn	#of examples times to be exact
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is the bottleneck in SO
 n4nd0	the argmax
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw delta is not included in subgradient here
 blackburn	only in argmax
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	we could say too that it is included in the risk
 n4nd0	not in the subgradient of rish though
 blackburn	ah right
 n4nd0	look at this
 blackburn	n4nd0: so do you get how to compute it now?
 n4nd0	shogun/structure/MulticlassRiskFunction.h
 blackburn	n4nd0: ha!
 n4nd0	I think the doc Michal wrote there is precisely the important part we are discussing just now
 n4nd0	and this deserves a huge LOL
 blackburn	n4nd0: regularizer is included
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm where?
 blackburn	wrong sorry
 blackburn	n4nd0: everything is clear for me now
 blackburn	omfg what does he do
 n4nd0	there is something that doesn't fit I thin
 blackburn	I have to change it now
 n4nd0	think*
 blackburn	what?
 blackburn	he compute feature vector and compute dot manually
 n4nd0	\ell(y_i,y)
 n4nd0	that should be the delta loss
 blackburn	where?
 n4nd0	doc in the header
 blackburn	multiclass risk/
 blackburn	?
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	so? it is implemented in line 90
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	it was just a misleading in the notation
 n4nd0	I am not saying is wrong
 n4nd0	what do you want to put in there, DotFeatures?
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	it is totally wrong to compute vectors here
 blackburn	imagine sparse features with 1%  nnz
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	100x speedup from nowhere
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	maybe we should tell Michal instead
 n4nd0	anyway, another thing
 n4nd0	I don't know why the hell do we need a risk function for multiclass, another for hm-svm, another for ....
 blackburn	he merged his stuff already I think so no problem
 blackburn	n4nd0: ehmm because it is simple for multiclass
 n4nd0	but it is the same for all
 blackburn	loop on line 82 is your argmax
 n4nd0	just the argmax and the psi changes
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	I think this risk function should go in StructuredModel
 n4nd0	and call the argmax and psi
 n4nd0	do you see my point?
 n4nd0	I mean it is like A.2 and A.8
 blackburn	yes that's misleading thing with our czech friend
 blackburn	friends :)
 blackburn	they tend to develop their own solutions
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	you have always to stop generalizing at some point...
 blackburn	yes sure
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	so you have everything you need already?
 blackburn	both psi and argmax?
 n4nd0	what?
 blackburn	do you have psi and argmax for hm-svm?
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	you always need those
 blackburn	so you can easily add risk function for that?
 n4nd0	I think so
 n4nd0	is what I told you
 n4nd0	I would just add a RiskFunction in CStructuredModel
 blackburn	but what was the problem?
 n4nd0	that I didn't know that the risk function was that...
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	so it is all now easy, right?
 blackburn	and we are happy? :)
 n4nd0	very happy :)
 n4nd0	I am actually suspicious
 blackburn	why?
 n4nd0	it seems far too easy right now
 blackburn	just try and compaer

 uricamic	hi, does anyone know what shall I do, to let configuration script find the MOSEK?
 wiking	yo
 wiking	blackburn magic ;)
 wiking	ah u r not here :(
 wiking	sonney2k: around?
 wiking	sonney2k:  i need some advise
 wiking	uricamic: here?
 uricamic	wiking: yep
 wiking	uricamic: n4nd0 had an idea yesterday to add the RiskFunction within the StructureModel class
 wiking	uricamic: i.e. simply adding a new pure virtual function risk(...)
 uricamic	wiking: yep, I think we had discussed that at the very beginning, so I am not against :)
 wiking	i see
 wiking	i'll check how that effects my code and i'll let you guys know whether i'm against it or supporting it :)
 uricamic	this divergence was done mainly, we had to submit some code and I was waiting for his part for too long, so I started to code it, to be able to continue, and we left this for later, which unfortunately never happened :)
 uricamic	wiking: ok
 wiking	hehe ok
 wiking	i hope i can get back to this today
 uricamic	I guess it is reasonable to have it together, because then user have to write just one derived class not many of them :)
 wiking	indeed
 uricamic	but also it was better to have it separate because of simultaneous work
 uricamic	but I guess now we can merge it
 wiking	my problem is simply the mixture of latentmodel and structuremodel
 uricamic	since GSoC end is coming :)
 wiking	they share a lot of things together but not
 wiking	so i'm still struggling with merging that too :))
 uricamic	:)
 uricamic	and maybe with merging also the support of user data for risk function will be simplified
 wiking	uricamic: heheh that's for sure
 uricamic	i.e. we could than remove CRiskData class, and all user data needed could be defined in the StructuredModel
 wiking	uricamic: i mean currently i hd the troulbe of having reference on some other functions
 uricamic	everything should be simplified then :D
 wiking	since i needed the reference on functions like argmax_{y} withing CRiskFunction
 wiking	mmm ok letme try to sketch up that thing now
 wiking	as otherwise i'm wating on blackburn to give me some advise
 uricamic	ok
 wiking	uricamic: ok i think i'm done with it
 wiking	:))
 wiking	the only thing is that i don't know what where to add the the MulticlassRiskFunction implementation
 wiking	uricamic: i've sent you and n4nd0 an email with the patch and some comments....

 blackburn1	hey there wiking uricamic
 uricamic	blackburn1: hi
 wiking	blackburn1: !!!
 blackburn1	uricamic: we discussed things with n4nd0 last night
 uricamic	yep, I have looked on the log :)
 blackburn1	uricamic: I am curious why we do not include regularized?
 blackburn1	zer*
 uricamic	blackburn1: what do u mean?
 uricamic	it is included in bmrm algorithm
 blackburn1	uricamic: L2?
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn1	so L1 is not possible?
 uricamic	I guess not in our implementation
 blackburn1	I see
 blackburn1	we need to merge things you all have done somehow :D
 uricamic	the problem with L1 is that it would not be that easily solvable
 blackburn1	uricamic: are you ok with changes in multiclass risk?
 uricamic	I think this was the general intention, we have discuss it with n4ndo when GSoC started, and then somehow forgotten about this idea to merge it together
 uricamic	blackburn1: sure
 blackburn1	that's really important to use dense_dot and add
 uricamic	as I said, it was just fast not very clever implementation just to prove, that it works :)
 blackburn1	I see
 uricamic	and I thing the way how wiking wants to merge it together is nice
 uricamic	and I guess also not very demanding or time consuming
 uricamic	CRiskData will disappear, because it will not be needed anymore
 blackburn1	right
 uricamic	and in StructuredModel virtual function risk will appear
 wiking	:)
 blackburn1	there are way too many entities here :D
 uricamic	yep, as I said, it was general intention to put it together eventually :)
 wiking	yeah a patch has been proposed
 wiking	now i'm waiting n4nd0 and uricamic's comments
 uricamic	because the risk function in fact uses argmax and loss function, which is already in StructuredModel
 uricamic	wiking: I am ok with it like it is, just don't forget to add implementation of risk function in MulticlassModel
 wiking	blackburn1: let me know when u have 5 mins
 wiking	uricamic: okey that shouldn't be hard ;P
 uricamic	nope, in fact it will be even easier now than it was :D
 wiking	uricamic: i'll wait for n4nd0's feedback as well and then i'll fire a PR :P
 uricamic	no need of using RiskData
 uricamic	wiking: ok, looking forward :)
 blackburn1	wiking: I will be back in 10 minutes
 blackburn1	and then lets discuss
 wiking	blackburn1: ok
 blackburn1	wiking: re
 wiking	blackburn1: rere
 wiking	blackburn1: so it's regarding the latentlabels fix
 wiking	so now i'm in a catch-22 state with the design
 blackburn1	damn I should read that book, I stopped on page 10 or so :D
 wiking	basically what a latent machine has is LatentFeatures, LatentLabels and Labels
 wiking	the thing is that currently LatentLabels is derived from binarylabels thus it's 2 in one
 wiking	this is good but till the moment when u want to have structural labels
 wiking	or any other types of labels, i.e. y_i
 wiking	i have two choices a) i separate h_i (latentlabels) and y_i
 wiking	or b) i add a CLabels object within LatentLabels to contain the y_i
 wiking	solution a) is cleaner i think but there comes the problem of standard API of CMachine
 blackburn1	no, I like b) more if I understand it correctly
 wiking	as it has CLabels* apply_<somekind> (CFeatures*)
 wiking	with that API i cannot return h_i and y_i
 wiking	so i have to break the API of machine
 blackburn1	I think latent labels should contain both h_i and y_i
 wiking	if i go with solution b) then yes
 wiking	that way i won't break any API
 wiking	but somehow the API won't be so clear for the latentmachine
 wiking	as the y_i will be 'hidden'
 blackburn1	I think that's ok
 wiking	i.e. it wont ever appear as a function argument for example when u create a latent machine
 blackburn1	just add a class to contain h_i and y_i
 wiking	blackburn1: ok then i'll just change the inheritance of CLatentLabels to CLabels
 blackburn1	yeah
 wiking	and basically add a CLabels within CLatentLabels to store the y_i
 blackburn1	any separating would be worse here
 blackburn1	hmm that makes sense too
 wiking	ok
 wiking	then i'll just stash now the structuredModel +risk refactoring until n4nd0 gives his comments...
 wiking	or maybe i just send in a PR about that
 wiking	and n4nd0 can comment there
 wiking	i have a feeling that'll be faster  ;P just as in case of unit testing :D
 blackburn1	I thought of latent as structured model
 blackburn1	can't you come this way?
 wiking	well
 wiking	that's the next step somehow
 blackburn1	I see
 wiking	but still cannot see a nice way to do it
 wiking	yet
 wiking	ok i'm away for 30mins to do so errands

 uricamic	wiking: I almost forgot one thing
 uricamic	in the patch, u can also change risk function from void to return float64_t, i.e. it will return value of the risk
 uricamic	blackburn suggested this, and it is reasonable

@sonney2k	wiking, could you please fix the compile error?
@sonney2k	hey gsomix - how is 0-copy stuff proceeding?
@sonney2k	wiking, why do your latentlabels derive from denselabels?
@sonney2k	and not just labels?
@sonney2k	at least this is the reason for the compile error
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah he knows :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: our SO guys need to make final effort to merge risk and models
@sonney2k	wiking, I am renaming your get_labels to get_latent_labels
@sonney2k	then this is resolved
@sonney2k	wiking - hope that is what you had in mind
 gsomix	sonney2k, good
@sonney2k	gsomix, so that means PR any minute?
 gsomix	sonney2k, nope
@sonney2k	gsomix, what does it mean then?
 gsomix	that I figured out how to do it rightly. and now doing
@sonney2k	ok
