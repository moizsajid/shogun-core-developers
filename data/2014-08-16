 kislay	hey besser82 , there?
@besser82	kislay, yes ^^
 kislay	how to stop the execution of a ipython notebook if an exception is handled.
@besser82	erm... yes...  good question... like any other python code as well, I think...
 kislay	besser82, http://pastebin.com/RX91p582
 kislay	check the code above.
 kislay	I thought exit() should do
 kislay	besser82, but it ended up killing the kernel.
@besser82	kislay, me too...  did you `import sys` ?
@besser82	and then it should be `sys.exit($errno)
@besser82	kislay, so in your case `sys.exit(1)`
 kislay	I googled a bit and found that importing sys is not needed.
 kislay	It can be done with/without it
@besser82	kislay, ok... did you try:
@besser82	import os
@besser82	os._exit(1)
 kislay	buildbot recognized what I did as a fault though. It came up in the nightly default build.
 kislay	So what you suggesting will lead to a clean exit.
 kislay	nope.. let me check it locally once.
@besser82	kislay, there is a more elaborated example over here:
@besser82	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/173278/is-there-a-way-to-prevent-a-systemexit-exception-raised-from-sys-exit-from-bei
@besser82	kislay, ^^ 2nd answer
 kislay	besser82, the one you told kill the kernel as the one I did. Let me check...
@besser82	kislay, otherwise there might be the break() instruction...
@besser82	as an option
 kislay	besser82, I tried break() and the notebook complained that a break is for loops kind of things only.
@besser82	kislay, then I have no idea as well...
@besser82	sry...  ;(
 kislay	besser82,  buildbot thinks a kernel killing as error. Thanks anyways ^^
@besser82	kislay, ^^
