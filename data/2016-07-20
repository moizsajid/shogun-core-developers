 c4goldsw	ping sanuj
 sanuj	c4goldsw, hello!
 c4goldsw	I have a question about squashing commits
 sanuj	yeah
 c4goldsw	I'm about to squash some for a PR, but there are also commits from other people between my first and last one.  Do I squash them all into one?
 c4goldsw	Even the ones that aren't mine.
 sanuj	no
 sanuj	c4goldsw, i think your work is not related to other people's commits
 c4goldsw	No, it isn't.
 c4goldsw	So, I just have to pick through my commits and figure out which ones belong to me?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	c4goldsw, how did you manage to get other commits between your commits?
 c4goldsw	I just merged my repo with the upstream one.
 sanuj	c4goldsw, with develop?
 c4goldsw	Yes
 sanuj	c4goldsw, you should always rebase
 sanuj	git pull --rebase upstream develop
 c4goldsw	What does that do?
 sanuj	rebases your commits on top of develop
 c4goldsw	Okay, makes sense.
 sanuj	c4goldsw, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing
 c4goldsw	Thanks sanuj
 sanuj	c4goldsw, happy to help :)
 sanuj	c4goldsw, i say, make a new branch from upstream develop
 sanuj	bring only your commits on the new branch from old branch
 sanuj	c4goldsw, you can use git cherry-pick for that
 sanuj	https://ariejan.net/2010/06/10/cherry-picking-specific-commits-from-another-branch/
 c4goldsw	And then replace my local develop branch with that new branch?
 sanuj	no need to replace
 sanuj	c4goldsw, whenever you work on new PR, make a new feature branch for it
 sanuj	will be easy to handle
 c4goldsw	Okay, thanks :)
 sanuj	wiking, there?

 OXPHOS	sanuj: there? can i ask you something stupid?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, hello
 sanuj	sure :D
 OXPHOS	sanuj: thx! what is the purpose of having tag-based parameter framework?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, it is to get rid of setters and getters in each class
 sanuj	by this you can set/get parameters by using a string -> name of the parameter
 sanuj	OXPHOS, this will help in implementation of plugins also
 sanuj	OXPHOS, and provide a nicer API
 OXPHOS	sanuj: oh so in your MockObject you're registering like ("vector", vec), but actually for a more complicated class it should be ("vector_for_this_purpose", vec)?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, it's not a stupid question, I asked this to sergey when I started this
 OXPHOS	:D
 sanuj	OXPHOS, name can be anything that makes sense
 sanuj	i think name of current member variables or similar can be used as names for parameters
 OXPHOS	sanuj: cool... so I have a specific scenario here. Are you familiar with serialization?
 sanuj	a bit
 OXPHOS	okay
 sanuj	storing classes in json, xml etc
 OXPHOS	so for the params you registered, say in MockObject, I will serialize them, via any
 sanuj	but i have not seen shogun's serialization framework
 OXPHOS	not important here :)
 OXPHOS	I iterate through the (basetag, any) map and serialize each Any object to save them
 OXPHOS	and for the loading
 OXPHOS	I just read the params from json or so and fill them to the (basetag, any) map also by iterating through the map
 sanuj	okay
 OXPHOS	now params in the param list/map are loaded
 OXPHOS	and I need to set each param from the map back to the variables, right?
 OXPHOS	like there's a vec in MockObject. and we registered as ("vector", vec)
 OXPHOS	but if I load it back to map["vector"]
 OXPHOS	will the vec in MockObject be updated? no i guess?
 OXPHOS	sanuj^
 sanuj	umm
 sanuj	OXPHOS, all the parameters are stored in map only
 sanuj	they are fetched from the map and set in the same map
 OXPHOS	sanuj: so once registered, the original param and the registered param are actually "detached"
 OXPHOS	for the "the registered param" I mean the Any object in the map
 sanuj	OXPHOS, i'm not sure if we will keep member variables to store the parameters
 sanuj	OXPHOS, i have member variables in MockObject just to test whether they work together
 sanuj	but "original param" and "registered param" are the same thing
 sanuj	we will only have one copies of params
 sanuj	and that will be stored in the respective map of the object
 sanuj	OXPHOS, the API is like this
 OXPHOS	sanuj: do you remember which test it is? or I can check
 sanuj	obj.set<int>("width", 5)
 sanuj	this will store the parameter in the map
 OXPHOS	okay
 sanuj	abj.get<int>("width")
 sanuj	this will fetch the parameter from the map
 OXPHOS	I see
 sanuj	so parameters are only read from the map and set in the map
 sanuj	OXPHOS, once the code uses this parameter framework, these two functions will be used to get/set params everywhere
 OXPHOS	I see yeah so I was using the wrong word "parameter" :P
 OXPHOS	I think I got it. but just to be sure:
 sanuj	so i think you just need to care about the map
 OXPHOS	there's an int variable in class, say a, we do obj.set<int>("width", a) in init_params() of the class
 OXPHOS	and a was set to 0 as default.
 OXPHOS	and after calculations, the `a` is changed to 8
 OXPHOS	we need to do obj.set<int>("width", a) again to update the param saved in map right?
 OXPHOS	sanuj^
 sanuj	OXPHOS, init_params() is called by the constructor
 OXPHOS	yeah that's what I mean
 sanuj	so in init_params() we register "allowed" parameters
 sanuj	by register_param()
 sanuj	and then use set()/get() to modify/get its value
 OXPHOS	okay cool I think we're on the same page
 sanuj	OXPHOS, nice :D
 sanuj	OXPHOS, i'm going to have dinner
 OXPHOS	sanuj: thanks so much!
 sanuj	will be back in 20-30 mins
 sanuj	OXPHOS, happy to help :)
 OXPHOS	sanuj: enjoy!
 sanuj	cya
 OXPHOS	see u soon
