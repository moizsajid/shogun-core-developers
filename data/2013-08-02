@wiking	lisitsyn: have u managed to find out something about octave?
 lisitsyn	wiking: not yet :(
 lisitsyn	okay actually I could try to do that now
 lisitsyn	although I am at job
 lisitsyn	;)
@wiking	go for it
-!- vgorbati [~vgorbati@91.216.173.29] has joined #shogun
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hi there. I have a question: say, I want to create a private field in class - std::set<Something> m_private_field - I've heard somewhere, that it is bad in shogun to include C++ headers (like set, vector etc.) in header file - is it so?
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes - it slows down the compilation process
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: and what's the workaround?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: if one exists..)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: it could be pointer to implementation
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: for example
 lisitsyn	A.h:
 lisitsyn	class AImpl;
 lisitsyn	class A
 lisitsyn	{
 lisitsyn	    AImpl* impl;
 lisitsyn	};
@wiking	lisitsyn: https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing
 lisitsyn	like that
 lisitsyn	wiking: I use it
 lisitsyn	wiking: http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me/ runs on digital ocean
@wiking	hih cool
 lisitsyn	wiking: vgorbati: http://www.youtube.com/user/HowToBasic?feature=watch
 lisitsyn	I can't stop laughing
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: is it the channel with 'How to break coconut' video?)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yeah, 'How to Crack Open a Coconut':)
 lisitsyn	oh damn
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: no coconut thing is not that funny!
 lisitsyn	there are others
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: the guy is crazy:) about my question: sorry, did not get it - what should I use then instead of 'std::set<Something> m_private_field;'?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: well, it was reviewed in RWJ and TiX, so I knew only about it:)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: ahh no I don't watch it
 lisitsyn	what you can do
 lisitsyn	is adding a pointer class
 lisitsyn	ehr
 lisitsyn	a pointer to some class' object
 lisitsyn	like implementation
 lisitsyn	and then you can declare it in .cpp
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: you mean declare the whole implementation class in cpp, and declare this private set field in this implementation class?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so that "#include <set>" line will go to .cpp file?
 vgorbati	omg, there's a channel 'include'))
@wiking	lisitsyn: just got for 5 usd for shogun testing
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: heh!
@wiking	lisitsyn: i want reimbursements :P
 thoralf	Hey.
@wiking	c++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
@wiking	lol
@wiking	woah first time i see this.... some gp class crashes the compiler :)
@wiking	LaplacianInferenceMethod.cpp :))
@wiking	let see if in develop is the same
 lisitsyn	wiking: memory?
 lisitsyn	wiking: is it digital ocean you are compiling at?
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes
@wiking	lisitsyn: aaaah 512 is not enouhg :DDD
@wiking	loool
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes indeed
 lisitsyn	laplacian blablabla is just using eigen
 lisitsyn	wiking: you'd have to compile somewhere else
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'll resize it
@wiking	i mean the droplet
 lisitsyn	wiking: try clang ;)

 thoralf	HeikoS: Just noticed your issue - you're doing it "your way"?  In that case we should link & close https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1332
@HeikoS	thoralf: ?? nothing decided yet on automagic tests
 thoralf	HeikoS: Sorry, read too fast.  Thought you just started implementing the thing to get example instances of every class.
@HeikoS	thoralf: nono, I wish I had :)
@HeikoS	but no time yet
@HeikoS	thoralf: we did not even discuss properly :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: Yes, that's why I suggested to close the discussion (based on wrong assumtions)

 lisitsyn	wiking: for sure!
@wiking	lisitsyn: the feature/CMake branch
@wiking	do u have octave?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	or do u mind to apt-get install it... just for temp
 lisitsyn	wiking: don't mind at all
 lisitsyn	jsut give me a bit
@wiking	kk
@wiking	let me know when u have it
 lisitsyn	wiking: configuring
 lisitsyn	wiking: do you remember what octave-config comes from?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	in ubuntu 12.04
@wiking	it's octave3.2-headers
@wiking	later ubuntus they managed to define a dummy package: octave-headers
 lisitsyn	wiking: I have no octave-headers :/
 lisitsyn	I think I found it
 lisitsyn	octave-pkg-dev
@wiking	lol
 lisitsyn	wiking: if you are curious
 lisitsyn	whether it found octave
 lisitsyn	the answer is no :)
 lisitsyn	okay let me check why
@wiking	pastebin it
 lisitsyn	wiking: -- Could NOT find Octave (missing:  OCTAVE_ROOT OCTAVE_INCLUDE_DIR OCTAVE_OCTINTERP_LIBRARY OCTAVE_OCTAVE_LIBRARY OCTAVE_CRUFT_LIBRARY)
 lisitsyn	that's it
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	git pull upstream feature/CMake
@wiking	it seems u dont have the latest ;)
 lisitsyn	ohh
 lisitsyn	let me check
 lisitsyn	true sorry
 lisitsyn	wiking: can't see octave at all now
@wiking	?
@wiking	cmake -DOctaveModular=ON ..
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	now yes
@wiking	did it detect?
 lisitsyn	-- Found Octave: /usr/bin/octave (found version "3.6.4")
 lisitsyn	wiking: ^
@wiking	mmm shit
@wiking	ok cool then this works
@wiking	something is wrong on travis
@wiking	i have to debug that somehow
@wiking	:(
@wiking	thnx anyways
 lisitsyn	wiking: what happens on travis?
@wiking	lisitsyn: one variable is not set...
