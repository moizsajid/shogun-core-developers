 yoo	hi there
 yoo	after adding (with blackburn)  ms_output->output_custom_evaluations(result_labels, m_labels) in crossvalidation->evaluate_one_run()  line 220, I add the same line 302 for machine with data unlocked (most machines I use) and I get a seg fault when calling m_custom_evaluations->get_num_elements()
 yoo	could someone explain me why ?

 thegruel	Hi all
 thegruel	Is there a ModelSelection expert in the house?
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@111.120.11.49] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 thegruel	Anyway... I was wondering if there is a model selection strategy in Shogun that allows selecting C1/C2 for libSVM but avoids the full grid search, ideally by enforcing C1=C2.

 blackburn	I just forgot to initialize it :D
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r57d6371 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Added missed initialization of custom evaluations array - http://git.io/RgVuwg
 blackburn	thegruel: we are kinda working on it
 blackburn	:)

 yoo	blackburn: hi
 blackburn	yoo: hi
 yoo	blackburn: I ve seen your fix but didnt solve the pb on my machine
 blackburn	yoo: still segfault?
 yoo	blackburn: yep, I am trying to reproduce the pb with simple shogun example
 yoo	give me a minute
 blackburn	would be nice
 yoo	do you have the link I gave you last night ?

 yoo	blackburn: ok this one http://pastebin.com/c7wKje0H : change the inputs and add msoutput as well =)
 blackburn	okay give me a minute
 blackburn	yoo: so what exactly faults?
 blackburn	adding a custom evaluation to output?
 yoo	blackburn: CModelSelectionOutput *ms_output = new CModelSelectionOutput(); how adding a custom eval to this obj ?
 blackburn	yoo: well actually it works here with latest git
 blackburn	yoo: ms_output->add_evaluation(new CMulticlassAccuracy()) will output you a confusion matrix on each split
 yoo	blackburn: ok sorry my bad, I didnt go throw your new add_custom function
 yoo	blackburn: works perfectly
 yoo	blackburn: btw what the best method if I want to store those matrices into files, is there interaction possible between msoutput and any filestorage obect  ?
 blackburn	yoo: yeah I thought of it
 blackburn	I can do that
 yoo	blackburn: the object msoutput dont store anythg right ? it just print the matrices ?
 blackburn	exactly
 yoo	well
 blackburn	yoo: I will just add output to ostream
 yoo	sure but then evrythg ll be printed, mb it should be smthg like the msoutput store data and then interact with what ever we need ?
 yoo	then we can draw smthg, compare different confusion matrices .. etc .. without parsing a file with every outputs ..
 blackburn	yoo: hmm okay I will do that this way then
 blackburn	I don't mind any
 yoo	It is mb more the way msoutput is designed for since your passng the obj in argument .. dunno :p
 yoo	thanks again for this great support !

 alexlovesdata	Hi students, ... did anybody of you qualify for London Olympics, lol?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: I failed to :(
 blackburn	for vodka pong
 alexlovesdata	ye, in Russia competition for that discipline is indeed hard and your liver might not be fresh anymore
 blackburn	being professional is a hard job
 alexlovesdata	unfortunately unreadable code which still works is not accepted yet
 alexlovesdata	otherwise I oculd have tried
 blackburn	:D
 alexlovesdata	no there was a mail by Carol Smith from google rumoring about that ... so the question has a grain of truth
 blackburn	chances are it goes to the special olympics program
 blackburn	very special :D

 n4nd0	good evening people
 blackburn	n4nd0: evening
 blackburn	n4nd0: how is it going?

 n4nd0	blackburn: haha, for your project or just for fun?
 blackburn	n4nd0: well I have to make multitask stuff work with subsets
 blackburn	thinking how to approach it better
 n4nd0	good
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is required to make xval work actually
 n4nd0	blackburn: good luck with it then ;)
 droopy	n4nd0, ;)
 n4nd0	I am sure you will find a good approach
 blackburn	heh thanks
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you ever actually use that xval and model selection stuff?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no!
 n4nd0	but I think I must look into it
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah at some point
 n4nd0	I know the concepts but I think I have never used them "for real"
 n4nd0	so I am not familiarized with them
 wiking	pijuuuuuu
 wiking	droopy pong
 droopy	wiking: and sgmatrix?
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you still follow boyd cvxopt book?
 wiking	alexlovesdata: yo
 wiking	alexlovesdata: have u seen my email?
 wiking	blackburn: btw this is some crazy ass russian movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445161/
 blackburn	wiking: I've never seen

 n4nd0	:(
 blackburn	n4nd0: just interested
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, are you following it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no :) I am way too lazy

@sonney2k	!seen gsomix
 droopy	gsomix (~gsomix@188.168.128.107) was last seen quitting from #shogun 1 day, 7 hours, 41 minutes ago stating (Read error: Operation timed out).
 n4nd0	!see n4nd0
 n4nd0	!seen n4nd0
 droopy	n4nd0, go look in a mirror.
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	sonney2k: you can keep track of us with this :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: he did send PR yesterday I think
 blackburn	but actually he is offline in jabber and irc :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, he told me that he is on some long train ride...
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	to vladivostok?
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	it takes 8 days btw
 blackburn	but I am sure he won't visit vladivostok :D
 n4nd0	8 days in train without changing country, that's crazy :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: if there was a better road it would take less time I think
@sonney2k	n4nd0, in germany that is no problem - we have the 'deutsche bahn'
@sonney2k	most reliable way to transport ever!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I won
 blackburn	t believe
 blackburn	something in germany works bad
@sonney2k	blackburn, won what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: pressed enter by mistake :)
 blackburn	read as one sentence
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	you should then :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: no way, why?
 blackburn	in russia we had 70 years of red madness and 20 years of robbery and thievery so there is a serious reason why all works so bad
@sonney2k	blackburn, was it ever better?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm is it better in west germany? :)
@sonney2k	but I can assure you that things are not totally different in germany
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's the only hope of immigrants don't take it away :D
 n4nd0	good night!
