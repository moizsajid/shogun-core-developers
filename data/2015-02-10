 Rahul21	HeikoS: Hello, I am a machine learning enthusiast . Though I am not eligible for GSoC this year, would I get support from the community as in a dedicated mentor like GSoC students get. I am learning about kernels through various online resources, so I thought of giving the "Output Kernels" a try
 Rahul21	* Output Kernel Learning
@HeikoS	Rahul21: hi there!
@HeikoS	no eligible for GSoC?
@HeikoS	but you still want to do a project ?
 Rahul21	HeikoS: Yes, I am all in for learning :)
@HeikoS	Rahul21: thats great
@HeikoS	we are always looking for people who want to help
@HeikoS	have  a look at the github entrance tasks
@HeikoS	they contain small things that you can use to get started
@HeikoS	the output kernel project is a big one, we should start with something simpler
 Rahul21	Ohh defintly, anything youd suggest. I was a web dev guy. So C++ is also new to me. I am good at Java though, but language aint a barrier I guess
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@59.177.205.212] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@lisitsyn	you probably going to receive more attention as a guy that works for free :D
 Rahul21	Hahaha can I still submit a proposal ? I just love the whole process, its so cool :)
@HeikoS	Rahul21: if you want to :)
@HeikoS	Rahul21: but if there is no point, why not just send ?ber-cool patches instead?
@lisitsyn	Rahul21: hmm what's the reason you are not eligible if you can tell?
@lisitsyn	just to be sure you are really not
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh your ? letter
 Rahul21	I graduated in 2014, I am applying for my masters in U.S so have free time. I dont want to the boring jobs they offer here. They are like super boring. Instead I prefer something where I get to learn
@HeikoS	well then, welcome!
 Rahul21	Boring = data entry in excel ( you can imagine )
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: who was admin last year apart from me?
@lisitsyn	Rahul21: hah I see
@lisitsyn	Rahul21: any chance to get accepted before that deadline?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: me? soeren?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: mmmmh ok
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: may be besser82
@lisitsyn	:D
 Rahul21	Umm I dont think so, Since I am not affiliated to my undergrad college anymore. I would probably be seen as a bad guy who breaks rules. Really dont want that tag :P
@lisitsyn	Rahul21: no I mean us masters
 Rahul21	The Masters Program generally starts from September
@lisitsyn	I see
 Rahul21	I dont see an iota of chance before that
 Rahul21	Well are you guys Machine learning Scientists ?
@lisitsyn	ok then just we would be happy if you help us improving this
@lisitsyn	Rahul21: HeikoS is scientist I am poor engineer
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you me soeren bj?rn viktor
 sonne|work	HeikoS: yes
@lisitsyn	5 admins ahaha
 sonne|work	HeikoS: do we have a wiki page with ideas yet?
@lisitsyn	we are like united states of shogun
 Rahul21	Id want to become a scientist someday :) U.S.S
@HeikoS	sonne|work: growing atm
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I made everyone admin to not be a single point of failure
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: which I would have been :0
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: that's good
@lisitsyn	jk
@besser82	lisitsyn, yo?
@lisitsyn	besser82: sorry :)
@lisitsyn	besser82: just mentioned you were an admin last year
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I need some more dot features in shogun (for histogram based features) etc so I would be happy to mentor that btw
@besser82	lisitsyn, ahh, yes :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, sonney2k / sonne|work made me so
 sonne|work	HeikoS: and the other thing I wanted to know - do we have decent random forests?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: fernando is the man ;)
 sonne|work	food
 Rahul21	This video by HeikoS is cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Z4z_3ZwE0
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: fernando is not food
@lisitsyn	you should ask him not eat him
@HeikoS	sonne|work: we have cart only
@HeikoS	not the bayesian (state of the art) one
@lisitsyn	bayesian cart?
@lisitsyn	really?
@HeikoS	I dont know how fast the implementation is and whezther its parallel
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah cart can overfit
@HeikoS	bart doesnt
@HeikoS	Rahul21: thanks :)
@lisitsyn	is it better than C5.0?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: a bit
@lisitsyn	hmm cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no its actually a lot better
@HeikoS	random forests are the best black box method out there
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: does bayesian mean I should provide some priors?
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	its in there
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw check this http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/delgado14a.html
@HeikoS	we should have a project that does this with Shogun
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes I did already
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: a bit confusing
@HeikoS	cool gsoc project
 Rahul21	I also wanted to ask, what are some good resources to learn ML ? I did google and quora quite a lot, but I would love to hear it from you guys
@HeikoS	Rahul21: best way to is study it :)
@HeikoS	but depends on what you want to do
@HeikoS	coding can also help
@HeikoS	but you have to understand the maths first, thats the most fundamental part
@HeikoS	lots of good books out there
@HeikoS	bayesian reasoning and machine learning by david barber
@HeikoS	pattern recognition and machine leanring by Chris Bishop
@HeikoS	Intro to Machine learning by Kevin Murphy (contains code for all plots)
@HeikoS	baber book also contains code for everything
 Rahul21	Okay I have started with the Intro to Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, its the Coursera Course

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you think about ESL?
@lisitsyn	elements of stat.learning
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  what sthat?
@HeikoS	well
@lisitsyn	I find it pretty cool
@HeikoS	yeah its nice
@lisitsyn	I do not understand bishop
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	but I do understand ESL
@HeikoS	its not very general though
@HeikoS	I think
@HeikoS	not flexible
@HeikoS	but very nice stuff still
@HeikoS	i just prefer bayesian
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I guess I had to take a few bayesian crash courses to get into that thinking
@HeikoS	I think its way clearer and more simple
@HeikoS	less mathematical
@HeikoS	and more practical
 sonne|work	HeikoS: alright so these 2 things would be nice to have - and from the jmlr paper I learned that they use the R random forest cran pgk

@lisitsyn	it is a single hidden layer neural net with some activation

 HeikoS1	besser82: why did you delete all the feature branches? just cleaning up?
@besser82	HeikoS1, yes... cleaning up...  were not all; only those which have been merged obviously:  ;)
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: yes please wiki!
 HeikoS1	besser82: ok cool thanks. Ill re-create the meta language soon though :)
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: ok then
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: what happened to the meta language project btw?
@besser82	HeikoS1, yes do so...  I removed it, because it was merged somwhen long ago...
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: it is more or less done
 HeikoS1	the guy is doing interviews currently so paused a bit
 HeikoS1	but he will send the big PR soon
 HeikoS1	its quite ocol
 HeikoS1	check here
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: https://github.com/sorig/shogun/tree/prototyping_meta_language/examples/example-generation
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: adding languages is as easy as adding a new tiny file
 HeikoS1	pretty awesome
 HeikoS1	though a bit slow
 HeikoS1	so we might move to a c-based parser
 HeikoS1	rather than the python one
 HeikoS1	python target is define here for example:
 HeikoS1	https://github.com/sorig/shogun/blob/prototyping_meta_language/examples/example-generation/targets/python.json
 HeikoS1	we will soon put entrance tasks to translate existing examples into meta language
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: nice!
 HeikoS1	its very cool
 HeikoS1	all examples in all languages !g
