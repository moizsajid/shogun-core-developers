 sonne|work	wiking: talk to vojtech please
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	sonne|work: just writing him. did he see the other proposals, or somebody just copypasted his proposals?
@wiking	sonne|work: ok done...
@wiking	i guess he is hyper busy but let's hope he'll have a second to answer
 sonne|work	wiking: I think he did
 sonne|work	write his own I mean
@wiking	kk
@wiking	letsee as i'm sure we'll have too many students/proposal and few slots
@wiking	so would be great to merge some of the proposals
@wiking	sonne|work: how's pushing gsoc this year...? lisitsyn or u or somebody else?
 sonne|work	no one really
@wiking	as we have max 24 days to submit the proposal
@wiking	ok fuckshit
@wiking	i nominate myself to do it
@wiking	thanx a lot for the support :)
 sonne|work	wiking: well I wrote a couple of mails but...
@wiking	lisitsyn: sonne|work do u have documents from the previous applications?
 sonne|work	wiking: important is the list of ideas
@wiking	if so could u send it over to me
 sonne|work	proposal can be done quick
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@24-134-74-216-dynip.superkabel.de] has joined #shogun
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah but we have like kazillions of ideas already
 sonne|work	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'osx2 - python'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@wiking	there are 21 proposals atm there
 sonne|work	wiking: but that was just copy & paste
@wiking	in the gsoc2014 doc
 sonne|work	none of them really polished
@wiking	ok i'll rearrange them by 'polished order' and try to get mines get in a tidy state
@wiking	and mail around to ppl who should do theirs... if possible
 shogun-buildbot	build #17 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@wiking	sonne|work: do u have prev year's proposal?
@wiking	sonne|work: if so could u just send it over somehowplz
 sonne|work	wiking: it should be in shogun publicity git
@wiking	mmm checking
@wiking	mmm no meaningful result on neither git grep GSoC nor for git grep "Google Summer of"
@wiking	:)
 sonne|work	wiking: maybe you don't have the repo
@wiking	sonne|work: well i've checked all the public repos of shogun-toolbox
 sonne|work	wiking: please email me your ssh key but I cannot do it before tonight
 sonne|work	not public of course
@wiking	heheheh
@wiking	13:52 < sonne|work> wiking: it should be in shogun publicity git
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	an extra repo
@wiking	i've read this as "shogun PUBLIC" git
@wiking	:)
@wiking	sorry
@wiking	sent
@wiking	btw on which server is that repo?
@wiking	7nn?
@wiking	maybe then i can addmyself ;)

 parijat	iglesiasg, I have sent a fresh PR for minibatch kmeans, please have a look when you have time
@iglesiasg	parijat, I have already written a couple of comments
 parijat	iglesiasg, oh! let me see
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.174.209] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
@iglesiasg	parijat, did you check your example with valgrind?
 parijat	iglesiasg, nope not this time let me check
@iglesiasg	parijat, I think there are some leaks since you reuse variables like result and centers
 parijat	iglesiasg, also some integration tests are failing I see
@iglesiasg	parijat, for instance, the memory block returned in the call to apply on l56 is not freed since result is assigned again before any call to SG_UNREF
 shogun-buildbot	build #19 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@iglesiasg	parijat, also, I don't understand why github is showing in red the mini batch kmeans you implemented inside KMeans.cpp
 parijat	iglesiasg, worry not I will fix the leaks! :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, there is just one commit here, and that is not included in upstream develop, so I don't understand why it is shown as a change
@iglesiasg	parijat, regarding the integration tests, that can happen because you added new attributes to CKMeans
 parijat	iglesiasg, are you talking about the earlier PR??
@iglesiasg	parijat, which would make integration tests fail if any of the examples returns an instance of CKMeans
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am talking about this one https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1824/files

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, riding the green wave :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, I don't get why everything inside method==minibatch appears as if it has been removed, since it has never been in the upstream repo
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, green party!!! :)
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build branch=develop 'osx1 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	no such builder 'branch=develop'
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build --branch=develop 'osx1 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, green tea party ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am still messing with osx and we need to find some solution for python3 but hey
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, well, actually: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb4%20-%20python3
@iglesiasg	aaah nothing
@iglesiasg	python3 just noted it
 parijat	iglesiasg, thats actually the earlier kmeans training method that was already there, its not minibatch kmeans implementation
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.172.171] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	parijat, aaaaah ok
@iglesiasg	parijat, I was thinking I don't recognize this one from last week. But just remembered that last week it was kmeans++ not actual kmeans :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but that is just the incompatibility between python2 / 3 so we could immediately fix it if we created new pickle data for python3
 parijat	iglesiasg, :) tell me about the integration tests, how can I fix them?
@wiking	sonney2k: key import plz
@iglesiasg	parijat, if the errors are because of the new attributes included in CKmeans, then you just need to re-generate data files for integration tests
@iglesiasg	there is an script called generate.py or so in tests/integration/python_modular
@iglesiasg	parijat, but please first check that it is because of the new attributes and no because of numerical errors!
@iglesiasg	the results should still be the same
@iglesiasg	well we could see da still in the data files I think

@sonney2k	wiking, how can I valgrind a test - I think MulticlassOCASTest has memory corruption issues
@sonney2k	wiking, it sometimes fails on OSX but works a lot of times too
@wiking	sonney2k: well on osx u cannot valgrind if u have 10.8+
@sonney2k	wiking, well I valgrind under linux
@sonney2k	wiking, but how do I do that with ctest?
@wiking	sonney2k: the valgrind output is here: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/
@wiking	although u would need a nice xslt to have a nice output
@wiking	sonney2k: other than that: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/164
@wiking	check the configure and the memory check task
@wiking	to see how to run cmake and ctest
