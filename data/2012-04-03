 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	gsomix: how is it going with your proposal man
 n4nd0	?
 gsomix	n4nd0, i'm writing now.
 n4nd0	gsomix: cool! do you find useful the one I sent you?
 gsomix	yep

 harshit_	n4nd0: please send me sample proposals also ..
 harshit_	having sometrouble making mine :(
 n4nd0	harshit_: trouble? why so man?
 harshit_	For creating the detailed timeline
 harshit_	what material were you talking about with gsomix ?
 n4nd0	I can send you that part then
 n4nd0	in any case, what projects are you applying for?
 n4nd0	it would be kind of weird to share proposal for the same project :P
 harshit_	C5.0 + regression solvers of liblinear
 harshit_	I think yours is SO learning . right ?
 n4nd0	ok, so give me an address and I can send you the timeline for the multiclass project I have done today ok?
 n4nd0	or SO, the one you prefer, they are pretty similar in structure actually
 harshit_	here : harshit.syal@gmail.com
 n4nd0	but I warn you, I think that mine's not pretty detailed at all
 n4nd0	it's quite basic actually :S
 harshit_	but still i'll get an idea
 n4nd0	yeah, sure
 n4nd0	please use it just as an idea ... it would be weird if we all send a very similar proposal :P
 harshit_	yeah sure , i wont copy it :)
 harshit_	but i thought they ask for weekly timeline
 harshit_	i mean details of each weak
 harshit_	week*
 n4nd0	I don't really know
 n4nd0	I suggest you to ask S?ren to get a better idea what do they want
 n4nd0	try to ask when you meet him around here so I can get also an answer for that :)
 harshit_	sure ;)
 harshit_	g2g its about 5 here , need to sleep
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	I was going to ask you about that man
 harshit_	bye
 n4nd0	becuase I see that you are with us in the chat lot of times
 n4nd0	but you have another time !
 harshit_	yeah have to manage somehow.otherwise my work wont progress

 mohataher	Thank you. Regarding sending a pull request, does it have to include any modification to the code/documentation or just a to try it out ?
 n4nd0	it should include a patch
 n4nd0	I think there was a conversation about that in the mailing list

 sonne|work	something is wrong then
 sonne|work	contours look pretty ok IMHO
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	aham
 sonne|work	I guess the first test to fix this would be to use just 1 kernel
 sonne|work	and if it still looks weird with 1 then figure out what the difference is...
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I just tried - looks still totally broken ... but no time to go deeper for now
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what do you suggest to use a CombinedKernel just appending one more kernel or one PolyKernel alone?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, I tried changing a couple of things and it broke too :S
 sonne|work	I even used a single GaussianKernel
 sonne|work	still all weird
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I can try to take it a look and show you the results in some minutes

 n4nd0	I am taking a look to the seg fault Nicholas has pointed out
-!- flxb [~cronor@e178173124.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: flxb]
 n4nd0	sonne|work: around?
 sonne|work	yes
 n4nd0	the way to do CV for kernel machines is to use the constructor that takes a machine and no features right?
 n4nd0	the kernel has to be set to that machine
 sonne|work	I think so - karlnapf is the expert for that
 karlnapf	hum? just read my name :)
 karlnapf	well you can specify a kernel before
 karlnapf	depends on what you want to do
 karlnapf	just simple CV for evaluation or parameter search?
 n4nd0	karlnapf: I am trying to fix the example of the guy that sent the mail to the list
 n4nd0	his problem is that when he does CV with LibSVM it seg faults
 karlnapf	ah, ok
 karlnapf	CV means what?
 n4nd0	the kernel has never been set, we should lock that
 n4nd0	cross validation, sorry
 karlnapf	just for simple evaluation or for a parameter search?
 n4nd0	so now I am trying to find out how to do it for LibSVM, I have managed to get something running
 n4nd0	I am afraid I cannot answer that :S
 n4nd0	I can so you the code of the example if so and you can tell me if it is all right, ok?
 karlnapf	mmh, well
 karlnapf	yes sure
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ugjie0
 n4nd0	so in the line 45
 karlnapf	ok
 n4nd0	before it was simply LibSVM(), and it turned out to seg fault for this issue that we get to execute a method for the kernel member of LibSVM
 karlnapf	yes you have to set the kernel before training in that case
 n4nd0	and the kernel had never been initialized
 karlnapf	the parameter search does not involve the kernel at all
 n4nd0	so this is cross validation then?
 karlnapf	no its a parameter search
 karlnapf	but this is based on cross-validation
 n4nd0	aham
 karlnapf	since you have to test your current parameters somehow
 karlnapf	and thats done with CV
 n4nd0	ok, I think I get the main idea
 karlnapf	there are two seperate classes for that, you can see them in the example
 n4nd0	my only concern is that now to create the LibSVM
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	doesnt that example work?
 karlnapf	should
 n4nd0	I have to use a value for C, and the labels
 n4nd0	yes yes, it does
 n4nd0	but idk if it does what it should do ;)
 n4nd0	so the point is
 n4nd0	when the instance of LibSVM is created now
 n4nd0	this values, are used somewhen?
 karlnapf	which values?
 n4nd0	the values for C and the labels
 karlnapf	ah ok
 karlnapf	well the labels are used in training, in the CV, they are needed
 n4nd0	I mean it because C is supposed to be tried out within an interval
 karlnapf	and the C value is just overwritten
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	but the labels are given again in the CV constructor, line 55
 karlnapf	oh, yes, true
 karlnapf	well, then you could create the SVM with an empty constructor
 karlnapf	and set just the kernel by hand instead
 karlnapf	classifier=LibSVM()
 karlnapf	classifier.set_kernel(kernrel)
 n4nd0	I think that is fairly reasonable
 karlnapf	(or so)
 karlnapf	we ineed do sometimes not check for good initialization
 n4nd0	great
 karlnapf	thats currently all a bit complicated i guess :)
 n4nd0	it works as well with the way you've suggested
 karlnapf	nice then
 n4nd0	and I like it more than using the labels in the constructor
 n4nd0	I found that confusing
 karlnapf	yes its nicer that way
 n4nd0	ok
 karlnapf	say n4nd0, are you fernando?
 n4nd0	so I think that I should just add a fix in the method that was seg faulting to fire SG_ERROR in case the kernel is null
 n4nd0	karlnapf: yeah! you are Heiko right?
 karlnapf	I am a bit confused by all these nicknames
 karlnapf	yes :)
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	but yours is even more difficult to guess :P
 karlnapf	yes, an error message if there is no kernelk would be nice
 karlnapf	yes, true ;)
 karlnapf	when blackburn shows up, we can talk about that subset stuff
 n4nd0	karlnapf: sure
 n4nd0	in the meantime I will add a pull request with the fix and answer Nicholas
 karlnapf	nice one
 karlnapf	I will continue on my work now, but will have one eye on the irc, see you!
 n4nd0	thank you, bye!

 blackburn	karlnapf: hey there
 karlnapf	hey blackbutrn
 karlnapf	blackburn, hi
 blackburn	karlnapf: I heard you wanted to kill me because of machine subsetting"? ;)
 karlnapf	krkr ;)
 karlnapf	no, just asking about it
 karlnapf	explain it so me
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	lets take a look
 blackburn	once you train machines OvO
 blackburn	you need to subset your trainset
 karlnapf	OvO is one versus one?
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/machine/MulticlassMachine.cpp
 sonne|work	yes^2
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	2yes
 karlnapf	hehe
 karlnapf	ok, why the need for subsets?
 blackburn	because it would be painful
 blackburn	to create new features
 blackburn	each time you want to construct ovo machine
 karlnapf	no I meant why needs OvO that?
 karlnapf	sorry doorbell
 blackburn	hmm because all the classes but some (m,n) pair should be ignored
 karlnapf	re
 blackburn	any better way would be welcome but I can't see any
 sonne|work	blackburn: so this is 'only' to avoid copying of data around right?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes probably
 karlnapf	How does LibSVMMutlicalss do this?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: they have some kind of subset index internally
 karlnapf	ok
 karlnapf	and why not subsetting features?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: possible...
 sonne|work	BUT
 sonne|work	what about model selection then?
 karlnapf	blows up
 sonne|work	can we have subsets of subsets
 karlnapf	mmh
 sonne|work	yeah
 karlnapf	Yes, one solution would be to have multiple subsets
 sonne|work	if we had a function to say train(features, subset) it would work
 karlnapf	like we talked about one year ago or so
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	thats possible on the locked data
 sonne|work	or a function that returns a subset given a subset as input
 karlnapf	but thats not good for OvO
 sonne|work	that might be sufficient ...
 karlnapf	I mean
 sonne|work	so a function that computes a new subset based on the current subset
 karlnapf	modelselection on kernel machines without locking is a pain anyway
 sonne|work	only if you can store the kernel in memory...
 sonne|work	(that was never the case in the applications I had)
 karlnapf	yes true
 karlnapf	ok so subsetting the machine
 karlnapf	that seems to be a good solution, however, we got many subset mechanisms then
 karlnapf	and they basically all take subsets of features
 karlnapf	if there was a way to register multiple subsets on features
 karlnapf	we wouldnt need all that stuff
 sonne|work	ok true
 karlnapf	like give each subset a unique identifier
 karlnapf	and pass it before accessing them
 sonne|work	some dynarray of subsets...
 karlnapf	yes
 sonne|work	but actually that would kill performance
 karlnapf	and how to access?
 sonne|work	maybe one can add subsets as one wants
 karlnapf	features subsets are currently used implicitly
 sonne|work	and then a 'current' subset is computed based on the subsets in the list
 sonne|work	so accessing features uses only this 'current' subset
 sonne|work	maybe current is the wrong term 'merged subset' is better
 karlnapf	oh yes, they would have a  hierachy
 karlnapf	hierarchy
 karlnapf	still the problem:
 karlnapf	A sets subset A
 karlnapf	B sets another subset on that
 karlnapf	B is not ready yet
 karlnapf	A wants to access
 karlnapf	and because A is just setting the subset once and then accesses implicitly this is a problem
 sonne|work	well I would say that B has to free its subset before passing on to A
 sonne|work	otherwise this gets too difficult
 karlnapf	ok
 blackburn	I do not really understand why you need any hierarchy or other stuff
 karlnapf	then it would be quite straightforward to implement right?
 blackburn	what are you trying to solve right now?
 karlnapf	blackburn, the problem is that modelselection subsets features
 karlnapf	and if the multiclass svm also does that, there is a kind of conflict
 karlnapf	a "subset on a subset"
 blackburn	oh
 karlnapf	would be needed, but currently thats not possible
 blackburn	yes got it
 karlnapf	and having multiple subset mechanisms (features, multiclass, locking) is a bit ugly
 sonne|work	karlnapf: yes I think this is doable
 blackburn	multiclass do not do subsetting actually
 blackburn	it subsets features
 blackburn	or kernel
 blackburn	nothing moer
 sonne|work	just some 'add_subset' / 'remove_subset' functions
 sonne|work	and whenever add/remove is called the 'merged' subset is updated (which is what we currently have)
 sonne|work	so no need to change the code we have now - just some additions
 blackburn	subset union subset?
 sonne|work	actually one needs to change all code that sets a subset
 sonne|work	it needs to use add/remove_subset
 blackburn	each time you add subset it subsets the subset?
 sonne|work	blackburn: it computes the subset of the subset of the subset - yes
 blackburn	sonne|work: it may break things then
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.249.161] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	we should set a maximum subset level to avoid abuse of this system ;)
 blackburn	earlier it was assumed that there is only one subset
 sonne|work	blackburn: what does it break?
 blackburn	sonne|work: no idea but karlnapf could know probably
 karlnapf	you lost me, what?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: blackburn is asking when setting subsets of subsets would break in the current system
 karlnapf	no I think not
 blackburn	ok then
 karlnapf	one just HAS to remove subsets after doing work on them
 blackburn	one issue is that add and remove are not interchangeable or so
 sonne|work	yeah so it should be safe
 blackburn	I mean add applies it on top of that
 blackburn	but remove removes all of them
 sonne|work	no
 blackburn	or I got wrong?
 sonne|work	remove removes 1
 blackburn	you want to do stack there?
 sonne|work	yes
 karlnapf	yes
 harshit_	sonne|work : I have updated the pull request, I think now its ready to be merged
 blackburn	good idea probably
 sonne|work	just an array of subsets
 karlnapf	Perhaps this removing could be possibly  done automatically in some destructor
 blackburn	I thought you wanted to merge subsets actually
 sonne|work	harshit_: Thanks - I will have a look later
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes for performance
 karlnapf	then we would not have seperate subset systems at three places
 sonne|work	we have one 'merged' subset
 blackburn	well two subsets is ok probably
 sonne|work	which is computed from the array of subsets
 sonne|work	such that we don't have to go through the whole array of subsets all the time
 blackburn	karlnapf: which three places?
 karlnapf	yes, all the subset instances are saved but everytime the stack is touched, atemporary "current" one  is created for performance thight?
 karlnapf	modsel, locking, multiclass
 blackburn	well I see no other way for multiclass ovo
 karlnapf	But when we have this new thing, you can just subset the features before training the class pairs
 karlnapf	and then the machines just train on "all" data (from their perspective)
 sonne|work	fight karlnapf fight
 sonne|work	:)
 karlnapf	lol ;)
 karlnapf	I went kick-boxing yesterday, still have Muskelkater, so, no thanks ;)
 blackburn	karlnapf: actually I think subset stack is a good idea not only wrt to ovo
 sonne|work	I also like it
 sonne|work	so who wants to implement it?
 blackburn	i.e. what if you want to do cross-validation on subset of your features?
 karlnapf	thats possible then
 sonne|work	blackburn: features -> you mean subset of dimensions
 sonne|work	or subset of examples?
 blackburn	oh no sorry
 blackburn	feature vectors
 karlnapf	that would work then
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	subsets of features would be interesting however it is a different system
 sonne|work	that's fine
 karlnapf	you just would have to check for class indices everytime, not just once in the beginning
 blackburn	is it required btw?
 karlnapf	yes, subsets of dimensions would be cool for feature selection
 karlnapf	but thats probably another story
 karlnapf	I cou?d implement the stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw what do you think about sparse linear machine?
 blackburn	karlnapf: please do if you have time ;)
 blackburn	I can but you would probably be able to test it better
 karlnapf	Its not ultra urgent, is it?
 sonne|work	blackburn: what for? what does it do?
 blackburn	karlnapf: no, not urgent at all
 blackburn	sonne|work: lasso
 sonne|work	blackburn: please elaborate
 karlnapf	because my parents are visiting me tomorrow and I only have a few hours per day, and also want to come up with the hypothesis test interfaces this week
 blackburn	sonne|work: lasso has only a few non zeroes in [w]
 sonne|work	karlnapf: but it should be rather easy
 sonne|work	maybe n4ndo would want to do it?
 blackburn	or gsomix?
 sonne|work	I mean it would just mean to add these to add/remove functions
 sonne|work	blackburn: no gsomix is busy with python3
 karlnapf	its ok, Ill do it
 sonne|work	and the merge function
 sonne|work	that's all or?
 karlnapf	there might be trouble with x-val
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you have any other tasks for gsomix?
 sonne|work	...can be fixed when it occurs :)
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.249.161] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 sonne|work	blackburn: e.g. octave_modular typemap for sparse features
 blackburn	sonne|work: because I want somebody to do LARS and he would do that
 blackburn	I see - then let him do this octave
 sonne|work	blackburn: you still didn't explain what sparselinearmachine is!
 sonne|work	gsomix: are you busy?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes,yes - what if w is sparse?
 karlnapf	sonne|work, I read the mail yesterday about the parameter selection for GPs, I think there might be some potential for creating new model selection classes
 sonne|work	blackburn: ahh you mean not to store whole w vector
 blackburn	rather not to compute outputs with whole one
 blackburn	it is the case of lasso
 sonne|work	blackburn: or one just adds a sparsify_w function ...
 karlnapf	one could generalize the modsel class to use specific evaluation functions (like model evidence or LOO) and then also specify gradients of them and create new GradientDescentModelSelection class or so
 sonne|work	for training it is tough...
 blackburn	sonne|work: sparse training you mean?
 blackburn	yes no need to
 sonne|work	karlnapf: you would probably have to help this student then
 karlnapf	yes, I like that kind of stuff
 sonne|work	blackburn: one way would be to then call compress_w and then apply uses the compressed representation of w
 blackburn	SNOW
 blackburn	WTF
 blackburn	SNOW in april!
 karlnapf	hehe :)
 sonne|work	we just had that on sunday
 blackburn	it is all dirty here
 karlnapf	I got foggy rainy Londonish sky here :)
 blackburn	and snow again
 blackburn	what the fog!
 karlnapf	there was snow in germany?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok then lars goes to n4ndo probably
 blackburn	I hope I do not overload him :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: if you know better what gsomix is interested in - tell me - or gsomix tell me :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: he is at uni right now probably
 blackburn	I saw him hour ago
 blackburn	sonne|work: director stuff btw
 blackburn	sonne|work: what is # of proposals?
 sonne|work	blackburn: he is more fond of that?
 sonne|work	directors I mean
 blackburn	sonne|work: I do not know
 blackburn	I'll ask
 blackburn	or you
 sonne|work	it is tough though and I guess he would need to write an isolated thing
 sonne|work	blackburn: 21 proposals by now
 sonne|work	3 days left...
 blackburn	I think new candidates should finish some small successful tasks
 sonne|work	yes - even after deadline but before we decide
 blackburn	that's why I am afraid of sparse matrix and other stuff
 blackburn	can you estimate men-day's? :D
 blackburn	man*
 sonne|work	sparse matrix?
 sonne|work	what?
 blackburn	sonne|work: software eng managers used to estimate man hours and man days :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: sparse matrix support for octave
 sonne|work	that is very easy (for me)
 sonne|work	so lets say 2 days max
 blackburn	ok nice
 blackburn	sonne|work: will you have time to guide him?
 karlnapf	hey guys, Do you know this possibility of approximating a kernel matric using incomplete cholesky factorisation?
 karlnapf	matrix
 karlnapf	I recently used that and found it quite cool, so perhaps there would be some room for it in shogun
 blackburn	karlnapf: what is *incomplete* cholesky?
 blackburn	ah let me google that
 karlnapf	sent you an email
 karlnapf	its an extract from the kernel methods book of john shawe taylor and nello crist....
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	oh I'll check it later
 blackburn	karlnapf: did you send the proposal alread
 blackburn	y?
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	hope you like it :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: this year we are going to receive 20% of last year ones :D
 karlnapf	what do you mean?
 karlnapf	ah like re-applying? :)
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	in total count
 blackburn	karlnapf: only you and me are re-applying afaik
 sonne|work	last year we had like 70 applications - this year it will be around 30 I guess
 karlnapf	really? how does that come?
 sonne|work	this is because we required patches even before applying
 karlnapf	projects too hard?
 sonne|work	and applications/candidates are much stronger
 karlnapf	mmh, was that a good idea then? the number of slots is determined by the number of applications thight?
 blackburn	not only I think
 sonne|work	yeah from that perspective not - but who can wade through 70+ applications?
 sonne|work	even reading them is *a lot* of work
 blackburn	sonne|work: especially if they are done by russians
 karlnapf	indeed
 blackburn	:D
 karlnapf	hehe :)
 sonne|work	and last year we had like 3 reviewers per student app
 sonne|work	and scores / final ranking
 blackburn	sonne|work: who did the job?
 sonne|work	we split work somehow
 blackburn	sonne|work: I mean who have participated in that?
 sonne|work	candidates that we were more sure of we wanted were reviewed by more people then
 sonne|work	everyone
 blackburn	mentors?
 sonne|work	of course
 sonne|work	mentors
 sonne|work	only
 sonne|work	that is how it works
 blackburn	I know, I am just curious :)
 sonne|work	I wish blackburn / karlnapf you both would be mentors instead of students
 sonne|work	:D
 karlnapf	Hopefully next year :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: if it was same-rewarded
 karlnapf	I desperately need money, unfortunately
 karlnapf	so expensive here
 sonne|work	no reward unfortuantely
 blackburn	yes that's why we want to be students :)
* sonne|work wants to be student to
 sonne|work	too

 karlnapf	what are you actually doing there? Like what kind of problems?
 sonne|work	so quite interesting
 blackburn	sonne|work: I bet your year salary is larger than gsoc reward ;)
 sonne|work	I am working in the HD traffic team - that is the one predicting jams / any kind of live traffic stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw can I intern there? ;)
 sonne|work	blackburn: you should go to university and become professor
 blackburn	would be funny
 blackburn	sonne|work: why should I?
 sonne|work	otherwise we will never have students to work for you on shogun
 karlnapf	lol :)
 blackburn	hah good reason to devote whole life for useless stuff there
 sonne|work	karlnapf: nothing to laugh here ;) you have the same destiny
 blackburn	sonne|work: what about you then?
 sonne|work	I left academia...
 karlnapf	we are all converging on growing shogun students ;)
 blackburn	yes I heard that before but no way back?
 blackburn	actually we've got one kind of brilliant  haha
 blackburn	sonne|work: what I think is there is no need to worry we are not the mentors
 sonne|work	karlnapf: I am attempting to grow+educate 2 kids to become shogun developers :D
 blackburn	first shogun girl?
 blackburn	we would have to wait at least 15 years more though
 sonne|work	blackburn: I do - every help is welcome (as always)
 blackburn	sonne|work: you do worry you mean?
 sonne|work	nowadays programmers start 6
 sonne|work	yes
 karlnapf	hehe, your kids
 karlnapf	I got a BASIC interpreter for my AMIGA for my 10th birthday from my father ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I think being mentors would mean we have no time for develop..
 blackburn	I got my first computer when I was 7
 karlnapf	And my parents always wanted me to do computer science, but I refused and went studying jazz guitar first ;)   so dont put too much pressure up, sonne|work ;)
 sonne|work	karlnapf: my son is 11 months and want to play games on my android phone :)
 sonne|work	but I don't understand how I got interested in this
 blackburn	sonne|work: he is also used to multiclass stuff already
 sonne|work	maybe because my parents always wanted to limit computer-time
 karlnapf	hehe, dont let him become a super-nerd ;)
 karlnapf	yes same here
 sonne|work	so I guess that is the key
 sonne|work	tough limits (he wants to break)
 blackburn	sonne|work: you should deny him to code perfectly later
* sonne|work thinks that karlnapf would have finished this sub-subsetting business by now if we wouldn't fool around...
 sonne|work	hehe
 karlnapf	I am studying ;)
 blackburn	and yes deny him to construct theory better than vapnik did
 karlnapf	but youre right, I should stop chatting
 karlnapf	take care guys :) (wave)
 blackburn	my son, never develop general pattern recogntion theory better than VC and PAC

 blackburn	n4nd0: can you remind me what is your 'contribution roadmap'? ;)
 blackburn	wiking: so what does he want?
 wiking	a little bit of change
 wiking	not so much
 wiking	basically we would remove the whole CLatentFeatures
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you mean, contributions in shogun?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 wiking	and just have CFeatures
 wiking	but they would contain all the features: x,y,h
 blackburn	wiking: and include things to latentlabels?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	how to separate it when?
 wiking	well you don't need to
 blackburn	then*
 n4nd0	blackburn: from the very beginning, CPLEX compilation, Mahalanobis distance, QDA, OvO, SPE
 wiking	optimizer doesn't need to know it
 n4nd0	blackburn: not that much :S
 wiking	what part of the feature is what
 wiking	the only thing that after the results
 wiking	the user of the tool will have to know what is what
 blackburn	n4nd0: sorry I meant what is next?
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham!
 blackburn	wiking: ah I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: so first we should manage to get merged SPE, did you see I updated it?

 wiking	but if it's not provided it should just do a brute force search
 wiking	i'm just wondering now
 blackburn	n4nd0: we shall wait for new subset stack concept ready
 wiking	whether the whole class should be inherited.... i.e. have a protected virtual function for finding the argmax of the latent variable
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: I've got a new task for you thought, LARS
 blackburn	interested?;)
 blackburn	wiking: whole class of?
-!- flxb [~cronor@141.23.80.206] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 wiking	or have a class that only has a function like this.. and that class should be inherited and redefine that function for finding the argmax

 blackburn	aha
-!- flxb [~cronor@fb.ml.tu-berlin.de] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me about it
 wiking	any input on it?
 wiking	i'd rather go with the latter option
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://www.machinelearning.org/proceedings/icml2005/papers/053_GeneralizedLARS_Keerthi.pdf??
 wiking	it feels better for me
 blackburn	n4nd0: generalized? simple would work as well :)
 blackburn	wiking: then go with latter ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: give me a pointer if so
 blackburn	n4nd0: scikits learn has one
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'll take a look on spe later
 n4nd0	blackburn: cool
 pluskid	n4nd0: maybe this one? http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/LeastAngle_2002.pdf
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py
 blackburn	yes this one
 pluskid	you wish to include LARS in shogun for, solving LASSO ?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	regression, cool
 pluskid	LARS is cool, but I heard that there are many more efficient algorithm for L1 regularized problems?
 n4nd0	aham, e.g.?
 blackburn	pluskid: I have not much expertise with linear regression, what would you suggest?
 pluskid	I do not know the literature (not familiar with optimization), actually, I always use LARS in my own work :p
 pluskid	blackburn: I heard some discussion about something like ??? gradient descent algorithms, but I do not understand the details
 n4nd0	I know gradient descent
 pluskid	But I do think LARS has an advantage that it gives you the whole path
 pluskid	I think many other algorithms only gives you the solution for a particular \lambda (regularization coefficient)
 pluskid	Maybe any of you could check out this package: http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/ , if you are good at optimization
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	nice reference
 blackburn	hmm that's something I should take care of
 blackburn	group based lasso is of interest for my project
 pluskid	hmm, I think those ideas interesting, too. But I never used them in practice yet, except simply L1

 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	good night
 n4nd0	good sth ;)
 n4nd0	so after the ideas that you suggested yesterday and the new one today, LARS ...
 n4nd0	let's go for LARS because it is the newest :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: what have I suggested yesterday?
 n4nd0	the tree
 n4nd0	the cover tree for knn too
 blackburn	aha
 n4nd0	parzen windows
 n4nd0	...
 n4nd0	:P
 blackburn	n4nd0: what about parzen window one with covertree internally? later we would merge good design from it to knn
 n4nd0	blackburn: idk if you're serious now
 blackburn	yes I am
 n4nd0	so parzen windows can be implemented with cover trees??
 blackburn	good question
 blackburn	probably not
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: actually it could if there was some threshold based covertree
 blackburn	but it would require patching covertree that is present in shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's do that new threshold based covertree and write a paper :P
 blackburn	I am afraid it is way too simple idea
 blackburn	original covertree supports it IIRC
@sonney2k	blackburn, is covertree only for euclidian distances?
@sonney2k	or can it work with any distance?
 blackburn	sonney2k: any
 blackburn	it requires nothing but pairwise distances
@sonney2k	ok then n4nd0 this definitely is my favourite then covertree knn :)
 n4nd0	i'll focus on that then sonney2k

 sidsniper	how can i test dim red algos? is there any data?
 blackburn	sidsniper: what kind of testing you want to do?
 sidsniper	reducing dimension of feature vector
 sidsniper	how did you test the correctness of algoriths implemented?
 blackburn	manually ;) and compared to other implementations
 sidsniper	so there must be some dataset which u had tested them upon?
 blackburn	yes, I tested it on swissroll, ORL and MIT-CBCL
 blackburn	swissroll is the simplest test I'd say
 sidsniper	okay
 sidsniper	so these are availaible online right?
 blackburn	sidsniper: yes
 sidsniper	ok thanks :)
 blackburn	sidsniper: have you doubts about its correctness?
 sidsniper	i have yet to test them..i m sure they will be correct :)
 blackburn	I'm going to implement unit-tests as well..
 sidsniper	if you can give me links from where you have implemented them it would be great
 sidsniper	ORL and CBCL are face database right?
 blackburn	sidsniper: implemented what?
 blackburn	sidsniper: yes
 sidsniper	implemented the algorithms
 sidsniper	dim red
 blackburn	hmm I mainly refer to dr toolbox

 sidsniper	nice :)
 sidsniper	i have to implement some of them for my project
 sidsniper	can u suggest how to proceed?
 sidsniper	i mean which are the easier ones
 blackburn	sidsniper: LLE is pretty simple
 blackburn	diffusion maps are as well
 blackburn	they are all actually pretty simple
 blackburn	but pretty slow in case of straightforward implementation
 sidsniper	so implementation part is hard?
 blackburn	depends on speed you need
 blackburn	I had to implement superlu and arpack wrappers
 blackburn	and to parallelize it
 blackburn	but in matlab it could be 20-liner
 sidsniper	okay
 blackburn	as for correctness
 sidsniper	but we have to do it in R language
 blackburn	they are all ill-posed
 sidsniper	will that be tough?
 blackburn	no idea
 sidsniper	i saw that shogub also suppports R

@sonney2k	harshit_, I am doing some whitespace cleanups and will commit soon - please have a brief look then. I hope this helps to make clear what I had in mind coding style wise
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am sorry to insist but, did you have time to take a look at multiclass proposal?
 gsomix	sonney2k, moin
@sonney2k	n4nd0, sorry not yet
@sonney2k	gsomix, so how is it going?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: all right, I am sorry that I rushed
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rcfab94a / (2 files): whitespace and coding style fixed in newtonsvm - http://git.io/wnQ-rw
 gsomix	sonney2k, i'm working on my proposal and python3 interface now.
 gsomix	sonney2k, are there other tasks for me?
@sonney2k	harshit_, please have a look at http://git.io/wnQ-rw
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.242.16.126] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, most important now is to write your proposal
@sonney2k	gsomix, apart from that  it depends a bit what you are most interested in doing
@sonney2k	I guess python3 stuff is close to final, so other simple task is to write swig typemap for octave modular
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@npasserelle10.minet.net] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	sonney2k : sorry having issues with Internet
@sonney2k	yeah I've seen...
@sonney2k	harshit_, btw can you write some more description about newton svm in the class description and mention the paper there?
@sonney2k	harshit_, ahh and before I forget - you didn't mention how shogun's newtonsvm performs on covertype data set vs. matlab version
@sonney2k	would be interesting to know
 harshit_	sure, i'll do it today
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. i will consider this issue later.
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, what are the "most used" CKernel children? DotKernel I suppose, but any other? :p
 harshit_	and for comparison there was a problem running the dataset on matlab version, so i compared it with liblinear results on that dataset
 harshit_	liblinear took about 3-4 sec to train vs my algo which took about 6-8 sec
 harshit_	and the final weight matrix was almost similar
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, please ask questions / update us - I am not really sure if the tasks you have are too boring for you.
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, the most used kernel is the gaussian  kernel
 harshit_	sonney2k : so after inclusion of documentation in NewtonSVM.cpp, do i need to issue a new pull request ?
-!- PhilTillet_ [~Philippe@tillet-p42154.maisel.int-evry.fr] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	harshit_, sure
@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, the most used kernel is the gaussian  kernel
@sonney2k	harshit_, what was the problem on matlab?
 PhilTillet_	yes, Actually every DotKernel could be more or less implemented the same way on OpenCL
 PhilTillet_	but might be different for some other kernel classes
 PhilTillet_	:p
 PhilTillet_	brb eat :D
 harshit_	sonney2k: matlab said there is some problem with minres() function when i used that dataset
 harshit_	but otherwise with other dataset it ran perfectly
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@npasserelle10.minet.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
@sonney2k	harshit_, and if you use a subset of this data set (say first 10000 examples only?)
 harshit_	I think that dataset is pretty big
 harshit_	to handle

 harshit_	oops forgot to do that !
-!- muddo [~muddo@gateway/tor-sasl/muddo] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, dotkernel is most important... / maybe a function to compute whole kernel/distance matrix based on opencl would be nice too
 harshit_	I'll do it today and report you, for now preparing my gsoc proposal ( i think i am running late on that)
@sonney2k	harshit_, yes that is most important true
 harshit_	sonney2k: after submitting my proposal i want to start working on lbp features implementation .
 harshit_	do you think opencv's implementation is portable ?
@sonney2k	harshit_, we have one in shogun that needs fixing - matlab / c code is avilable
 harshit_	sonney2k: LBP features is already in shogun ! I thought that needs to be implemented from starting
@sonney2k	harshit_, it is in unfinished state
 harshit_	anyways that is great I can start working on it ~
 harshit_	please just give me any link to the matlab/c code from which it was ported
@sonney2k	harshit_, when it is in you can do some nice demo using opencv and these LBP features - to detect gender of a person based on an image of the face
 harshit_	sonney2k : actually I have done something like that using deep learning "sparse autoencoders"
 harshit_	I think it would be easy for me
 harshit_	great thought
@sonney2k	karlnapf, around?
 gsomix	sonney2k, boring problem - this is also the problem. :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes hi
 karlnapf	whats up?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, would you mind if I give you github commit rights - I mean you are a core developer without this right for some time now...
@sonney2k	you can still do the same workflow
 karlnapf	why should I mind this? :)
 karlnapf	Should I have a look at people's requests then?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I knew that you like to break things
@sonney2k	karlnapf, if you have time - that's welcome
 karlnapf	sure, of course then
 karlnapf	I will still ask you guys to take a look on stuff which involves larger changes
 karlnapf	sonney2k, I am just wondering what is our favorite way of doing intending in python, spaces or tabs?
 blackburn	Juggy: still there?
 blackburn	sonney2k: finally!
 blackburn	Juggy: http://shogun-toolbox.org/edrt/tutorial.pdf probably that one, it is unaccurate though
 blackburn	in*
 blackburn	PhilTillet_: btw I have something really big to propose
 blackburn	I have some collection of dimensionality reduction algorithms there.. ;)
@sonney2k	karlnapf, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox - welcome to the team but now officially :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, sing some russian love song for heiko please - to celebrate this event!
 karlnapf	yeaaah :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: love song? like 'it is ok to be gay'?
* sonney2k turns the volume to the max!
 karlnapf	blackburn, gogo
@sonney2k	blackburn, no sth. like ~~~oh~~~heiko~~~in~~~your~~~code~~~ohh~~~we~~~trust~~~
 blackburn	??????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????
@sonney2k	karlnapf, regarding spaces - it might be that python3 wants spaces ... not sure
 blackburn	? ?????????? ? ????????? ???? ?????
 karlnapf	sing louder blackburn, cant hear you
 blackburn	???? ??????? ?? ???? ????????
 blackburn	?? ??????????? ????????????????????????!
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok, but we can convert, just asking
 blackburn	kind of old love song hahaha
 blackburn	just like sonney2k asked
 karlnapf	I love these letters
 karlnapf	want to learn Russian at some point
 blackburn	funny it is a war song probably hahah
 blackburn	WW2 yes
 karlnapf	Ill double check with google translate
 blackburn	karlnapf: would be pretty senseless

 blackburn	sonney2k: let you organize shogun code sprint at berlin? ;)
 karlnapf	also a nice idea

 karlnapf	hehe, well I know many people to stay at
 karlnapf	yes would be kind of cool to meet
 karlnapf	blackburn, how is your german? :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: ~ to your russian ;)
 blackburn	ich bin mude
@sonney2k	ich bin immer muede
 blackburn	karlnapf: wo bist du?
 karlnapf	ich bin in england
 blackburn	sonney2k: ??? ?????
 karlnapf	ich bin sehr m?de
 karlnapf	????
 blackburn	yes I know umlaut is there
 blackburn	too lazy to type it
 blackburn	?
 karlnapf	how to type it on russian keyboard?
 blackburn	karlnapf: do I remember that correctly - u mit dem umlaut = ?
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	using compose key
 blackburn	u+right alt+"
 karlnapf	yes
 blackburn	karlnapf: I had been studying german up to 7th grade at school
@sonney2k	another very strong proposal got submitted... many are from phd students this time
 blackburn	for two years probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: w/o contributions?
 karlnapf	ah really, thats more than my russian
 karlnapf	which project?
@sonney2k	libqp
 gsomix	>> phd students *__*
 karlnapf	yes, phd all over the place, gsoc is very academic
 blackburn	my belief is proposal w/o contributions would not work
@sonney2k	karlnapf, last year that was not the case
 karlnapf	sonney2k, probably means that stuff is more advanced, or they checked last years projects or so
 karlnapf	I mean if you dont do machine learning the stuff is pretty tough
 karlnapf	even if you do its not trivial
@sonney2k	many things this year are really tough
@sonney2k	for example for SO we didn't have any proposal last time
@sonney2k	this year quite a bit
 blackburn	this year we have mighty n4nd0
 karlnapf	SO?
 blackburn	structured ouput
 blackburn	tput
 karlnapf	ah ok
 karlnapf	yes, cool thing is that
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw checking your spe right now
@sonney2k	anyway we have 9 mentors so max slots is 9
 karlnapf	lets hope to get all that !
 blackburn	uh
 gsomix	oh
 blackburn	pretty impossible probably
@sonney2k	karlnapf, actually in retrospect I am happy that we got just 5 slots last year
@sonney2k	it really was a lot of work
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok I believe that
@sonney2k	this year though we have n4nd0, blackburn, karlnapf and others helping others
@sonney2k	it is not soo much all on my shoulders any more
 karlnapf	yes, you did almost everythign last year
@sonney2k	so maybe this process can scale
@sonney2k	and actually students this year all submitted github pull requests before
@sonney2k	with pretty nice work that goes deep into shogun
@sonney2k	last year we were switching from svn -> git in the process
 karlnapf	this year we got the buildbots
@sonney2k	we were doing conversions like double* -> sgvector
@sonney2k	we created buildbots
@sonney2k	etc
-!- flxb [~cronor@g231218093.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lots of infrastructure that is now there and helps to keep the project in a sane state
@sonney2k	to conclude - we should be realistically able to handle 9 students
 blackburn	sonney2k: what was there before gsoc 2011?
 karlnapf	sonney2k, wow that would be amazing.
 karlnapf	do you know how google allocates slots?
 karlnapf	only in terms of application #
 karlnapf	or also other stuff?

 blackburn	karlnapf: to be fair we fit 1), 2), 4)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, just trying out a request
 karlnapf	does the workflow change?
 karlnapf	do I still make pull requests and then merge them myself?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I like it pretty much
 blackburn	karlnapf: I think this type of commits would be better to be direct
 karlnapf	ok so only pull request for larger stuff
 karlnapf	and direct means I clone the actual shogun repo?
 blackburn	karlnapf: yes
 blackburn	karlnapf: ah yes
 blackburn	you need to push to
 karlnapf	ok then
 blackburn	google, shogun and github
@sonney2k	karlnapf, btw you can from now on just do (C) Heiko S... no need to mention TU or so any longer
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw
 blackburn	I had idea before
 blackburn	Written and Copyright now are pretty same
@sonney2k	blackburn, karlnapf I disagree
 blackburn	sonney2k: about?
@sonney2k	I am very much favoring pull requests
@sonney2k	and then have someone else looking at it
 blackburn	sonney2k: for small fixes?
@sonney2k	but yeah I know blackburn you disagree
@sonney2k	blackburn, for small fixes pull request + self merge
 blackburn	this takes more time..
 karlnapf	ok like examples and stuff, but its always good to get stuff reviewed when its more complicated
@sonney2k	and avoids quite a bit of stupid errors
 blackburn	sonney2k: these stupid errors emerge pretty rarely..
 karlnapf	blackburn, I have a talent of finding stuff like this ;)
 blackburn	I still don't like this kind of self-merge

 blackburn	is to use #XXX stuff
 blackburn	for example if you are pretty ready to merge PR no need to wait
 blackburn	you may commit with 'blabla Closes #XXX'
 blackburn	and actually we can use not only PRs but issues as well
 blackburn	we can commit with #XXX to incorporate commit to this issue

 shogun-buildbot	build #198 of nightly_none is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/198
 blackburn	here we would have docu improvements
 n4nd0	karlnapf: about the answer to the issue, can you elaborate a bit more on that? what is the idea then? not to serialize SGNArray stuff?
 n4nd0	karlnapf: I think that might be a problem because for example QDA has some members of that type
 karlnapf	n4nd0, no that was just a general thought
 karlnapf	this is possible (and very nice I think)
 karlnapf	but its more complicated than on the first impression
 blackburn	and once I add new commit
 n4nd0	karlnapf: I see, I have no idea how serialization stuff works in shogun
 karlnapf	if you dive into the load_serializable method of CSGObject you will that there are many places where these types have to be handled
 karlnapf	n4nd0, is it important that you need that?
 CIA-64	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rb1b17cb / src/shogun/converter/DiffusionMaps.h : Added note about lapack performance with diffusion maps #418 - http://git.io/4zEjlQ
 blackburn	it appears in #418
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/418
 n4nd0	karlnapf: you mean if I need to use that type in QDA?
 blackburn	sonney2k: karlnapf: what do you think?
 karlnapf	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	karlnapf: at the beginning I was simply using SGMatrix *
 n4nd0	karlnapf: the idea is that I need a list of matrices
 karlnapf	blackburn, I think thats nice, but is it easy to handle?
 n4nd0	karlnapf: but that SGMatrix* turned out to be a bit problematic also with this issue, the serialization
 blackburn	karlnapf: yes all you need is to recall # of issue
 karlnapf	n4nd0, i see
 n4nd0	karlnapf: so sonney2k proposed to use SGNDArray instead
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah I like that - we had this same feature with trac before but also there rarely used it - just because we never really managed to use issues all the time
 blackburn	sonney2k: that would be faster for doc fixes and other small fixes
 blackburn	too much pull requests would slow down things I think
 karlnapf	n4nd0, ok, probably good idea then
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am saying lets use it but I don't know how who will file issues all the time
@sonney2k	not sure if we are enough developers yet for that stuff
 karlnapf	n4nd0, I just hate to touch the migration stuff ;), but should be doable, if you want, take a look
 n4nd0	karlnapf: so the thing is that right now serialization in QDA wouldn't work right?
 karlnapf	n4nd0, yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm just write somewhere (doc fixes goes to #418)
 karlnapf	not too bad now, but should be done on the long run
 n4nd0	karlnapf: I will write that in the doc. at least
 blackburn	would be nice to make some other keyword referencing
 n4nd0	karlnapf: yeah, I agree, sooner or later it must be done
@sonney2k	blackburn, can I close an issue from via a commit message?
 karlnapf	n4nd0, yes, perhaps during the summer :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: closes #418
@sonney2k	k
 blackburn	sonney2k: just like pull request
 blackburn	but no need to switch between fork and origin
 blackburn	sonney2k: fixes, fixed, fix, closes, close, closed
 blackburn	and of these words
 blackburn	any*
 blackburn	ok have to clean up my damned traffic sign recognition paper be back in a hour or so

@sonney2k	PhilTillet_, btw how are you progressing with your patch?
 PhilTillet_	They are all about eigenvalues right?
 PhilTillet_	Well, pretty hard
 PhilTillet_	I cleaned my source
 PhilTillet_	so that there is a clear OpenCL structure
 PhilTillet_	to compile programs etc
 PhilTillet_	and now I copy with direct memcopy, without using ublas
 PhilTillet_	I mean, for now my patch is mostly the opencl code
 PhilTillet_	and basically a shogun::ocl::svm::init()
