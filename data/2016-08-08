 c4goldsw	Hello
@wiking	y0
 c4goldsw	Good weekend?
@wiking	ehehhe

@wiking	Saurabh7, ping
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.20.216] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	lisitsyn, hey
 lisitsyn	sanuj: hey
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how was weekend?
 sanuj	i'm writing a readme for tag parameter framework
 lisitsyn	sanuj: cool
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I nearly made it work
 lisitsyn	the SG_ADD thing
 lisitsyn	but
 lisitsyn	MockObject is exported into modular interfaces
 lisitsyn	it's quite strange
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do we use register_param() or register_member() in shogun class constructors? I mean, SG_ADD only has register_member() right now.
 sanuj	what is strange about MockObject being exported into modular interfaces?
@wiking	sanuj: as i explicitly told u
@wiking	not to do it
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking, oh the include?
 lisitsyn	check the travis error
 lisitsyn	it fails on undefined equals for MockObject
 lisitsyn	I am not sure why
 sanuj	checking
 sanuj	undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun6equalsIPNS_11CMockObjectEEEbPT_S4_
 sanuj	but it was necessary to include MockObject in modular interfaces to test them
 lisitsyn	uhm
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	then lets add equals for that guy
 sanuj	lisitsyn, shall i do it and send a PR?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no
 lisitsyn	I will commit to the same branch
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, am i missing anything? :P
 lisitsyn	sanuj: missing what?
 sanuj	something that you are trying to say and I'm not able to understand
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	nope
 lisitsyn	whhy?
 sanuj	that 'uhm' made me think :P
@wiking	sanuj, weekly?
@wiking	Saurabh7, ^
 sanuj	wiking, sent
 sanuj	news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun
 sanuj	doesn't work
@wiking	i remember rumors that gmane.org will > /dev/null soon
 sanuj	really
@wiking	https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2016/07/28/the-end-of-gmane/
 sanuj	i watched star wars last night :D
 sanuj	there is a picture of yoda in there ^
 c4goldsw	wiking > /dev/null nice idiom.  Will remember that.
 sanuj	indeed
@wiking	c4goldsw, oldskewl irc/unix slang
@wiking	when a GUI was something of a rather fancy thing to have
@wiking	and not only stupid people in a tv series would use bitchx irc client
@wiking	:)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add implementation for MockObject equals
 sanuj	let's hope this doesn't fail
 Saurabh7	yo
@wiking	Saurabh7: sup?
 Saurabh7	wiking: hi there
 Saurabh7	wiking: i will send falconn and some tests needed , on top of this
 Saurabh7	then random  rotation ensembles
@wiking	cool
@wiking	i'm looking forward
 lisitsyn	wiking: why do we have two travis jobs per pr?
 lisitsyn	one is called pr and other is push
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i only saw 2 jobs on your PRs
 lisitsyn	do you mean it is only my PRs causing that?
@wiking	lisitsyn, hahahah no fucking idea
 sanuj	no idea
 lisitsyn	uhm really
 lisitsyn	I guess this is because I am merging branch to branch
@wiking	lisitsyn, fuck man
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i don't see 2 jobs on my PRs
 lisitsyn	instead of fork branch to branch
@wiking	lisitsyn, are you like doing this PR on upsstream?
 sanuj	haha
@wiking	lisitsyn,  feature/tags from feature/tags_sg_add
@wiking	this is why
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 sanuj	i see
@wiking	i mean travis should know better
@wiking	but then again
@wiking	yeah this is the reason
 lisitsyn	yeah reason is known now
 lisitsyn	not sure why though
 lisitsyn	ok we will wait 2x
 sanuj	if one passes, the other will pass
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i saw the python build
 sanuj	ImportError: /home/travis/shogun-build/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/_modshogun.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun6equalsIPNS_11CMockObjectEEEbPT_S4_
 sanuj	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/150623526#L2930
 lisitsyn	damn
 lisitsyn	my fix was wrong
 lisitsyn	fucking mock object
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	ebating mock object
 lisitsyn	yeah this
 lisitsyn	this is unacceptable
 lisitsyn	http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/b7/b78b823b8f0a3cd741dda653960002e7e15b2ca3a90c6e310dfc17cd1a09ff83.jpg
 sanuj	haha
 Saurabh7	loll
 sanuj	lisitsyn, can't we undo the swig commit?
 sanuj	we can
 lisitsyn	which ?
 sanuj	swig can be merged after SG_ADD
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	lets just fix it
 lisitsyn	unaceeptable
 sanuj	lisitsyn, did you look at the modshogunPTYHOn big file?
 lisitsyn	no need to
 lisitsyn	I know why it failes
 lisitsyn	fails
 sanuj	kk
