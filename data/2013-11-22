@wiking	sonney2k: we have a slight problem with 3.0 documentation
@wiking	at least one class is missing
@wiking	StohasticSOSVM is not present among the class :S
@sonney2k	wiking, what ifdef's does that have?
@wiking	sonney2k: basically non
@wiking	*none
@wiking	this is the only to includes in the header
@wiking	#include <shogun/lib/SGVector.h>
@wiking	#include <shogun/machine/LinearStructuredOutputMachine.h>

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix protobuf cmake detection / generation
@sonney2k	wiking, crazy! no idea how that can happen
@wiking	me neither
@sonney2k	wiking, my only though was that it is e.g. ifdef HAVE_SOMETHING
@wiking	yeah but nothing like that :S
@sonney2k	and we don't define that so doxygen cannot pick it up
@wiking	it's just not there :D
@sonney2k	wiking, there are other weird things; http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classclass.html
@sonney2k	from http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/annotated.html
@sonney2k	class class -> FactorAnalyssis ?!

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add PROTOBUF to doxygen defines
@sonney2k	wiking, what do we do with fPIC detection
@wiking	sonney2k: needs to be more robust
@wiking	dunno what machine+os combination really requires fpic
 shogun-buildbot_	build #1969 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1969  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	wiking, well what we could do is have a new version of shogun uploaded into debian
@sonney2k	then see where it fails
@sonney2k	that should cover most of the available architectures
 shogun-buildbot_	build #346 of FC19 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FC19%20-%20libshogun/builds/346  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	wiking, another upcoming issue shogun won't work with newer glpk http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=714396
@wiking	i thought i've fixed all deprecated shiatz with glp
@wiking	k
@wiking	heheh fuck
@wiking	ok
@wiking	need to check on it
@wiking	sonney2k: i guess it's a quickfix in FindGLPK
@wiking	"The configure scripts of shogun
@wiking	tests for some of these obsolete functions, and consequently fails to detect
@wiking	the new glpk.
@wiking	"
@wiking	wtf?
@wiking	there's no function test there
@wiking	where's the debug log?
@wiking	wait
@wiking	is this now a bug against 1.0xxx or 3.0?
@wiking	Package: src:shogun
@wiking	Version: 1.1.0-6
@wiking	Severity: normal
@wiking	Usertags: glpk
@wiking	from that i think this bug is against 1.1.0-6
@wiking	so we do not need to worry as this is done differently in cmake
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah no idea - not yet critical :D
@sonney2k	wiking, the way we have protobuf now sucks a bit
@sonney2k	wiking, one needs protobuf libs installed to work with libshogun headers *sigh*
@sonney2k	it needs the d-ptr treat
@sonney2k	wiking, errm? any idea why shogun doc is still at 3.0.0 even for latest?
@sonney2k	sth is weird here

@wiking	sonney2k: ok so a bit about modularizing
@wiking	sonney2k: once we have the things for generating modular ifaces w/o libshogun compile
@wiking	we should do a release
@sonney2k	man we have plenty doxygen errors!

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: various further fixes
@sonney2k	sonney2k, now the stochastic SO svm is in the docs :)
@sonney2k	wiking, I think our 3.0 docs are outdated...
@wiking	sonney2k: :S\
@sonney2k	wiking, I guess doc updating / compiling or so didn't work so we have obsolete ones on the website

@wiking	falure man
@sonney2k	wiking, not my fault
@wiking	yeah i see
@sonney2k	wiking, problem with this test is that when mldata connection is flaky
@sonney2k	then it won't be able to fetch the data from it
@sonney2k	so we cannot but fail
@sonney2k	wiking, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1767 what is the MACHINE macro?
@wiking	u r asking me:
@wiking	792f8955 src/shogun/base/Version.cpp    (Soeren Sonnenburg  2013-02-06 13:56:15 +0100  44)      SG_SPRINT("libshogun (%s/%s%d)\n\n", MACHINE, VERSION_RELEASE, version_revision)
@wiking	more concerned i'm about LINKFLAGS
@wiking	as that should be defined in config.h
@wiking	btw
@wiking	#define MACHINE "x86_64"
@wiking	so it's there
@wiking	so for some reason config.h is not included

@wiking	execute_process(COMMAND uname -m
@wiking	    OUTPUT_VARIABLE MACHINE_OUTPUT OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
@wiking	SET(MACHINE ${MACHINE_OUTPUT})
@wiking	done
