@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah you get it right I think :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the other thing - you know why the pointer is null
@HeikoS	because the thing was freed?
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@120.59.205.250] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	no I mean
@lisitsyn	if you have some wrapper for the thing that is potentially absent
@lisitsyn	you can check whether it is absent
@lisitsyn	and then if it is absent you can log something
@HeikoS	I sewe
@HeikoS	see
@HeikoS	cool thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what about this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_plugin
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: some very common use case is to find something in collection
@HeikoS	description is too short
@HeikoS	timeline, waypoints, entrance tasks, suggested reading, examples etc
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh yeah let me extend it
@lisitsyn	will do it tomorrow
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and this one would also be good to have  adescription for
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_project_parameters
@HeikoS	with your new ideas for that
@lisitsyn	ok
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: good
@HeikoS	btw did you look at this user guide thing?
@lisitsyn	sorry not yet
@HeikoS	https://github.com/karlnapf/shogun_manual
@lisitsyn	looks interesting
@HeikoS	we should get this before gsoc
@HeikoS	and the meta examples too
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: get like get merged?
@HeikoS	so that every student can write like 1 entry each week, and translate 3 minimal examples
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, and easy to extend
@HeikoS	meta examples are in
@HeikoS	I am currently editing the travis file to include it in the build
@HeikoS	no idea how to change buildbot
@lisitsyn	hmmm I thought someone knows how to change buildbot
@lisitsyn	I guess only wiking
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: just emailed wiking :)
 kingsley	Do you happen to know if anyone has tried optimizing the hyperparameters passed to machine learning algorithms (like the number of trees to be used by a random forest) with pre-existing non-linear optimization code like gradient descent or integer programming?
 kingsley	I'd like to think that a guided search of hyperparaemters would be more efficient than guessing, trial and error.
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^ I think you're expert here ;)
@HeikoS	kingsley: for sure
@lisitsyn	kingsley: people like to model performance as gaussian processes
 kingsley	HeikoS: Please elaborate.
@lisitsyn	that's how MOE and hyperopt work
@HeikoS	kingsley: what people often do is to use stochastic black box optimisers for example, see cma
@HeikoS	kingsley: or look up bayesian optimisation, which is also about this idea
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/Yelp/MOE
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint
@HeikoS	where the idea is to put a gaussian process on the surface of the function your are optimising, and then use information theoretic ideas to select the next point to look at using a exploration-exploitation tradeoff
 kingsley	OK, you have given me much to think about.
@HeikoS	kingsley: would be a cool thing to have for Shogun
 kingsley	I'll check them out.
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw
@HeikoS	discrete case is another thing
@HeikoS	much much harder to do
@lisitsyn	I was curious about MOE
@lisitsyn	have you seen how it works?
@lisitsyn	wanted to ask you whether we can do the same in shogun
@HeikoS	MOE uses bayesian optimisation
@HeikoS	I invited Matthew Hoffman to give a talk here at UCL on Friday
@lisitsyn	yes with GPs
@HeikoS	http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/hoffmanm/
@lisitsyn	so can we do this with shogun and if not what is missed?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, kingsley https://github.com/mwhoffman/pybo
@HeikoS	thats the way to do this
 kingsley	HeikoS and lisitsyn: Thank you very much for saving me from re-inventing the wheel.
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would be cool to use MOE in shogun, what do you think?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes or do the same thing with our own GPs
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: though its not parallelisable
@lisitsyn	that's why I am asking ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cma is better in that respect
@HeikoS	we could use our own gps sure
@HeikoS	but why do that?
@HeikoS	people have done it, its just a matter of plugging things together
@HeikoS	the bayesian thing is hard to parallelise
@HeikoS	cma is easier to
@HeikoS	based on particles
@lisitsyn	what's cma?
@lisitsyn	covariance matrix adaptation?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	that works very nicely
@HeikoS	I use it for some things sometimes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: though the thing is
@HeikoS	cma is a one-guy library and also method
@HeikoS	whereas bayesina optimisation is a large field with lots of excellent people doing research on
@HeikoS	and yelp is a kind of plus too
@lisitsyn	we should have both
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: interfacing with MOE is easy
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats cool
@HeikoS	we should do that
@HeikoS	its important
@HeikoS	but next year
@HeikoS	thats part of making model-selection easier and offer full pipelines
@HeikoS	but we are not there yet
@HeikoS	need other things first
@lisitsyn	I'd do that in a few hours I guess
@HeikoS	maybe
@HeikoS	yeah cool thing in fact
@HeikoS	though I wonder... maybe you should spend these hours on something else currently??
@HeikoS	we have so many things that are not working properly
@lisitsyn	yes :)
@lisitsyn	I just mean it is not a big deal to interface with that
@lisitsyn	they have a few examples
@HeikoS	hyperparameters are not really an issue currently
@HeikoS	yeah I have seen
@HeikoS	 but then we need
@HeikoS	cmake options
@HeikoS	a build
@HeikoS	tests
@HeikoS	etc
@HeikoS	so not sure
@HeikoS	whether its a good time now
@HeikoS	hackathon thing
@HeikoS	actually
@lisitsyn	no it is not :)
@HeikoS	that'd be cool
@lisitsyn	do you think hackathon thing is possible still?
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: UK won't let me in :D
@HeikoS	but I cannot do this alone
@HeikoS	we need:
@HeikoS	1.) BSD
@HeikoS	2.) foundation
@HeikoS	3.) user guide
@HeikoS	without that it will not work
@HeikoS	oh and
@HeikoS	0.) installation
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: why wont they let you in?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: cold war :)
@lisitsyn	well actually this list is doable
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it IS doable!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: there is a wisdom I've learnt at some point
@HeikoS	which is?
@lisitsyn	to develop something it is usually enough to set up a cycle
@lisitsyn	when you change, compile and test
@lisitsyn	and to make people use software you just have to make it installable :)
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	even with scarce functionality
@lisitsyn	it will be used
@lisitsyn	if it just works
@lisitsyn	you know people use VW so much
@HeikoS	yes I agree
@HeikoS	it is cool
@HeikoS	shogun is not installable
@HeikoS	people fail all the time
@HeikoS	half my institude tried it
@HeikoS	institute
@lisitsyn	haha
@HeikoS	smart people you know
@lisitsyn	yeah that's the priority one thing
@HeikoS	not linux experts but know things
@HeikoS	but they just are overwhealmed
@HeikoS	so the install project is a must
@lisitsyn	we can even have two students on that
@HeikoS	if we dont get a student for that, I refuse to do GSoC :D
@lisitsyn	you're still phd
@lisitsyn	student I mean
@HeikoS	I cannot do it
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	why? :D
@lisitsyn	admin?
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	I dont know these things
@lisitsyn	ah
@HeikoS	also no time
@lisitsyn	yeah sure :)
@HeikoS	viktor could do it
@lisitsyn	I am not student and corporate slave
@HeikoS	but he also doesnt have time
@HeikoS	you could do it
@HeikoS	but also no time
@HeikoS	so we need a student who somehow knows
@lisitsyn	remember I am not a student  :)
@HeikoS	I do
@lisitsyn	good time to sleep
@HeikoS	same here
@HeikoS	good night!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll extend these gsoc ideas tomorrow
@lisitsyn	see you! gntie

 joergkurt	with clean I mean fresh Ubuntu14.04 in VirtualBox and then a native from GIT source, if all dependencies are properly defined in the install docu, all should just compile through, I guess we neeed some refinement on this process, since my naive attempt does not work right away

 joergkurt	hoi
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: looks like you've already installed shogun :)
@lisitsyn	I mean from you mail I see you've run an example and it worked
 joergkurt	nope, its compiled, but not running :(
@lisitsyn	what do you mean?
@lisitsyn	what if you run python and write 'from modshogun import KMeans'?
 joergkurt	import works, kinda busy right now, can I get back to you in 2h...?
 joergkurt	sorry, just have to do something else ...will get back to it later...
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: sure. but if import works probably everything is probably ok anyway :)
 joergkurt	ok, lets figure it later :)

 joergkurt	ok, my bet, it works, I was kinda expecting distance_tanimoto_modular.py returns some console printout, its not
 joergkurt	so, seems to works just fine, one other question
 joergkurt	if loading a dat set like feats_train=RealFeatures(CSVFile(train_fname))
 joergkurt	how can I get this into a python object I can also process on the Python side, and vice versa?
 joergkurt	Second question, how can I load a sparse file, and which formats are accepted, also for usage in Python?
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@59.177.140.38] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
@lisitsyn	ok first
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: what do you mean python object?
@lisitsyn	I am not sure I get what you want to do with that

-!- exploreshaifali [~shaifali@182.70.196.201] has joined #shogun
 joergkurt	maybe I just dont know all details, the CSVFile is loaded, how to I access the elements in this object?
 joergkurt	feats_train=RealFeatures(CSVFile(train_fname)), aka how does a data object look like and what are access functions?
 joergkurt	since its SWIG I assume the data is staying at the C++ side and Python is just pointing to it
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: yes
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: it depends what you want to do
@lisitsyn	simple access like per vector is easy
@lisitsyn	use get_feature_vector
@lisitsyn	if you want to change data you'd probably have to get vector, modify it and set_feature_vector
 joergkurt	the fecture vector requires an index, so do I need to do this element-wise?
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: that's the index of vector
@lisitsyn	so vector-wise
 joergkurt	iterator or loop 0length ?
 joergkurt	vector is here a feature, right? (not an instance)
@lisitsyn	might be confusing but it is an instance :)
@lisitsyn	or example
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: you can access whole matrix as well
@lisitsyn	get_feature_matrix
@lisitsyn	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CDenseFeatures.html
 joergkurt	(checking...)
 joergkurt	vectors=features
 joergkurt	features=instances
 joergkurt	right?
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: example is feature vector
@lisitsyn	its components are features

@lisitsyn	wiking: looks like you've been having busy times lately?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	soon over
 joergkurt	is there an overview about data formats, especially sparse ones, have seen libSVM is supported...
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/4.0.0/classshogun_1_1CLibSVMFile.html
@lisitsyn	that's for libsvm
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: hdf5 and protobuf are also supported

-!- mode/#shogun [+o iglesiasg] by ChanServ
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: who's there
 joergkurt	hdf5 support spare and dense right?
 joergkurt	sparse and dense?
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: looks like only dense
 joergkurt	imports SparseFEatures.h
 joergkurt	ehm, includes
-!- prakhar2511 [~prakhar25@202.78.172.162] has joined #shogun
 joergkurt	probably last question for today, if I wanna bind from C++ directly, any algorithm and property parser available, or do we need to hard bind all algorithms and algo properties?
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: something like using classifier based on some configuration file?
 joergkurt	yes, something just defining data+config file
@lisitsyn	if yes then the answer is no but sounds like a feature request
 joergkurt	:)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: surprise! xD
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: how is it going?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: very well, with you?
 joergkurt	kinda factory pattern on C++ side or compiler-compiler for some to be defined algo+property language
 joergkurt	BTW, where are you folks from?
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: yeah I'll think about it and describe as an issue
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: different places
@lisitsyn	I am from the most wild country in the world
 joergkurt	me:German:nowBelgium
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: you're close to iglesiasg which is now in netherlands
@iglesiasg	yep, me:Spanish:inNL :)
 joergkurt	ah, hi, iglesiasg, hoe gaat het?
@iglesiasg	het gaat heel goed, en met jou?
 joergkurt	ah, hola :)
@iglesiasg	hahaha hola, hola
 joergkurt	hihi :P
@iglesiasg	where is Belgium are you?
@iglesiasg	in*
 joergkurt	living in Mechelen (between Brussels and Antwerp), working in Beerse/Turnhout (Janssen Pharma)
@lisitsyn	you have bad weather there, do you?
 joergkurt	never :P

@lisitsyn	joergkurt: this big bear to the east of you
 joergkurt	russia?
@lisitsyn	yeap
 joergkurt	ah, cool, some of our developers are from Russi ...
 joergkurt	Russia
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: somehow bad environment produces good math and software guys :)
 joergkurt	(best dev of the world, honestly!)
 joergkurt	ok, sold now, we will integrate shogun as soon as we get to it ;)
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: what do you want to apply it to?
 joergkurt	where are you located (please tell me StPetersburg ;)
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: unfortunately moscow :)
 joergkurt	hihi, ok :P
 joergkurt	kinda big compute ML stuff, with tendency to multi-class and MKL
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: svms?
 joergkurt	...possible...its still cubic, and we will see if it can handle our data sizes
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: shogun is good but we lack ease of installation and may be better API
@lisitsyn	but if you push us enough and tell us what's better be fixed it would be fixed ;)
 joergkurt	never mind, so far things look good
@lisitsyn	joergkurt: one thing is that we have pointer based api
@lisitsyn	but that's going to be fixed soon
 joergkurt	right now we are aiming at writing single train-test instances and just wanna call them via algoXZY with parameter setting XYZ
 joergkurt	then we fetch the results and estimate profiling (time,space) and scientific performance
@lisitsyn	I see

-!- prakhar2511 [~prakhar25@202.78.175.199] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 joergkurt	rephrasing question, in CDense the types are listed bool, 8bit, etc
 joergkurt	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CDenseFeatures.html
 joergkurt	what are the equivalent sparse features being allowed in CSparse
 joergkurt	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/classshogun_1_1CSparseFeatures.html
 joergkurt	if I interpret this correctly the template allows largely numeric, and boolean as input
 joergkurt	this means all integers are in a numeric relationship, right? Nominal classes are not allowed as input space, just as multiclass labels for prediction?

 f0z	hey
 f0z	Can anybody guide me through how debugging is done in shogun?
 f0z	Any...body?
 f0z	@lisitsyn Do you mind?
@lisitsyn	f0z: hey
 f0z	hey
@lisitsyn	f0z: well, we mostly use gdb and valgrind
@lisitsyn	what do you want to debug?
 f0z	No no
 f0z	I am not talking about that
 f0z	I am talking about SG_DEBUG flags and the likes
@lisitsyn	sg_debug is basically a printf
@lisitsyn	that shows something is the level is set to debug

@lisitsyn	if you are asking how to see sg_debug messages then the answer is
@lisitsyn	just get global io
@lisitsyn	anyshogunobject->io
@lisitsyn	and call set_loglevel
@lisitsyn	anyshogunobject->io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG)
 f0z	what's the default state?
@lisitsyn	iirc it is msg_info
@lisitsyn	so only SG_INFO are shown
 f0z	so this isssue
 f0z	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2723
 f0z	I get how to compute the avg. gradient and all
 f0z	i mean absolute value
 f0z	but do I have to put explicitly that info somewhere using these flags?
@lisitsyn	hmm not sure I get the question
@lisitsyn	but currently SG_INFO is used here
@lisitsyn	so the gradient stuff should be output as info as well
 f0z	by SG_DEBUG or SG_INFO? the latter one right?
@lisitsyn	SG_INFO yeah
@lisitsyn	it is not debug info I think as watching at gradients is normal for neural networks training

 f0z	thanks@@
 f0z	i meant thanks!!!
@lisitsyn	you're welcome :)
 smallgraph	yeah, if I can't see those numbers change I nearly die because of impatience^^
 smallgraph	lisitsyn, do you also have time for my question?
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: sure
 smallgraph	I'm trying to build from develop branch but get this error:
 smallgraph	Linking CXX shared library libshogun.dylib
 smallgraph	Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
 smallgraph	  "shogun::CGaussianARDFITCKernel::get_parameter_gradient(shogun::TParameter const*, int)", referenced from:
 smallgraph	      vtable for shogun::CGaussianARDFITCKernel in GaussianARDFITCKernel.cpp.o
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: oh
@lisitsyn	should be easy to fix
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: let me update and reproduce
 smallgraph	well the method is there, so I don't see why the compiler does not generate it
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: could be due to no eigen available
@lisitsyn	do you have eigen3?
 smallgraph	ok, no, not yet^^
 smallgraph	Oh, I did install it, but cmake did not find it^^
 smallgraph	let me check why
@lisitsyn	smallgraph: could be the reason

 smallgraph	thanks :)
