 harshit_	hello people...
 blackburn	hi
 harshit_	hey blackburn do you knw any function to find inverse of matrix in C++
 blackburn	we have one in CMath::inverse
-!- pythonroar [d2198538@gateway/web/freenode/ip.210.25.133.56] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	yeah got it, there is one pinv
 harshit_	i think that would work
 harshit_	also one more thing
 blackburn	pinv is for pseudoinverse
 blackburn	if you have a square non-singular matrix you may simply use inverse
 harshit_	actually i want to convert A\B  in matlab to C++
 blackburn	what is B?
 harshit_	so i should use pinv no ?
 blackburn	a vector?
 harshit_	A is matrix and B is vector
 blackburn	IIRC A\B is a solution of Ax=b?
 harshit_	yes
 harshit_	also in course of converting code from matlab to c++ i have made a lot of new math function,
 harshit_	like creating a diagonal matrix
 blackburn	well inverse is not the best way to solve Ax=b
 blackburn	worst probably :D
 harshit_	so what should i do
 blackburn	use lapack dgesv
 harshit_	find a function in lapack
 harshit_	?
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	great, even better
 blackburn	inverse is pretty hard to compute
 harshit_	yeah .. got your point
 harshit_	is there a wrapper for dgesv in shogun ?
 blackburn	no, it is not needed
 blackburn	harshit_: is you matrix symmetric?
 harshit_	no .
 harshit_	its a matrix created from combination of feature matrix and weight matrix
 harshit_	so it cannt be symmetric
 blackburn	you need to use wrap_dgetri to wrap_dgetrs
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	inverse is computed with dgetri anyway
 blackburn	so probably it is the same for general matrix
 blackburn	harshit_: in this case it is ok to use inverse and matrix-vector multiply then
 harshit_	i think lapack's dgesv would be better
 blackburn	dgesv does the same
 harshit_	thanks  blackburn for help
 harshit_	Also my code is about to get over . so could you please guide me though the process of pushing on github
 blackburn	create fork, commit your changes into it and create pull request using github
 harshit_	so i can commit only cpp and .h file , or i can make changes in some existing files like math.h
 blackburn	in your fork you may change what you need
 harshit_	okay got it .. thanks again
 blackburn	when you do a pull request you ask admins to merge changes into main repo
 blackburn	if something was done wrong you just would be asked to fix it
 harshit_	got it..
 harshit_	one more thing in gsoc, if we want to submit more than one project to shogun for gsoc,Does all of them need to be in the same application ?
 blackburn	yeah probably
 blackburn	if you want to apply for a few ideas you should write a proposal for each of them
 blackburn	it doesn't mean they should be completely different but anyway should be separated
 blackburn	ok have to go now
 harshit_	got it
 harshit_	thanks blackburn
 harshit_	bye

 sahils_	can anyone please help me with it?
 sahils_	This is my first time on an IRC channel.
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.130.255] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 n4nd0	sahils_: hi!
 n4nd0	welcome ;)
 n4nd0	so are you interested in any project in particular?
 sahils_	thanks a lot for replying
 sahils_	was feeling a bit lost here
 sahils_	:)
 sahils_	yeah, I was interested in the third idea stated on shogun ideas page
 sahils_	implementing new machine learning algorithms
 n4nd0	sounds good
 n4nd0	it would be probably useful that you contact the mentor for that project
 sahils_	i have had previous experience in machine learning implementation, I have tried ID3, regression etc
 n4nd0	cool
 sahils_	yeah I shall do that
 sahils_	but I wanted to know one thing
 sahils_	does shogun support random forest algorithm
 sahils_	i was very interested in that one and could not find it explicitly in the source
 n4nd0	mmmm I don't know with certainty
 sahils_	oh ok
 sahils_	I shall contact the mentor then
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	and I think you should checkout the project code and get used to it
 sahils_	may I know if you are also planning to participate or are a mentor
 sahils_	?
 n4nd0	you may have read that it's a requirement to do a small patch together with GSoC application
 n4nd0	I'm student as well
 sahils_	yeah, I have read that. I somehow couldn't get the source code working on my machine
 sahils_	my university has proxy restrictions on downloads so could not get the dependencies
 sahils_	trying a work around now
 n4nd0	I think that is the first step you should do
 n4nd0	ok
 sahils_	yeah
 n4nd0	sahils_: I've to go now
 sahils_	no problem, thank you so much

 karlnapf	sonney2k, now there?
 karlnapf	trying to fix these de-serialization things, but got some questions on how the testsuite works
@sonney2k	karlnapf, hi
 karlnapf	hi
@sonney2k	karlnapf, the testsuite (aka tester.py and generator.py) do nothing more than run the examples
-!- blackburn [5bde8018@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.222.128.24] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	hey what's up
 karlnapf	where are the serialised files?
 karlnapf	because the txt files in the tests folder contain pickle serializations
 blackburn	data/testsuite
@sonney2k	karlnapf, that means that generator.py runs the examples with every setting listed in paramer_lists and pickles the results
 karlnapf	but the problem is when loading serialized files right?
 karlnapf	I want to load such a file by hand and see what goes wrong
 blackburn	karlnapf: what is the problem?
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	karlnapf, then tester.py runs the same example again and loads the serialized file and compares
@sonney2k	that's it
 karlnapf	yes
 karlnapf	ok, but everythign works with pickle serialization files?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, the problem can be easily triggered when you try to load e.g. classifier_libsvm_modular0.txt
 karlnapf	from python pickle?
 karlnapf	not possible from c++?
@sonney2k	just do x=pickle.load(file('classifier_libsvm_modular0.txt'))
 karlnapf	ok will try that
@sonney2k	and then pickle.dumps(x)
@sonney2k	you will see that kernel etc is NULL
 karlnapf	is there some way to extract the shogun serialized files from these txt files?
@sonney2k	well you could do the same from C++ - but you would need an old file
 karlnapf	because form python, working on this is a bit messy
 karlnapf	that why I want to extract such a file from the txt file
@sonney2k	karlnapf, well then use shogun 1.1.0 to serialize the minimal libsvm example
@sonney2k	and then load it with shogun 1.2.0
 karlnapf	mmmh, ok
 karlnapf	thanks for the tips
 karlnapf	will try to fix it now
 blackburn	guys, what are the problems?
 blackburn	is parameter mapping failing?
@sonney2k	blackburn, one cannot load old serialized files
 karlnapf	blackburn, some files are not properly loaded, subsvms of multiclass svm are NULL
@sonney2k	as soon as a new parameter is there it fails
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh tht's bad :)
@sonney2k	but it works ok if one comments the code block showing these WARNINGS
@sonney2k	about new params
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was always curious, do people really store a lot of shogun's files?
@sonney2k	no idea
 blackburn	I mean we care on that too much (just my opinion)
 blackburn	pretty late to stop but anyway
@sonney2k	then we can aswell remove all means to serialize shogun objects
 karlnapf	sonney2k, do you have some names of classes that fail to load? then I will use them for testing first
@sonney2k	libsvm
@sonney2k	but as I said any class that has a new parameter
 karlnapf	kk
 blackburn	sonney2k: first spare evening for last N months?
 blackburn	;)

@sonney2k	n4nd0, what are the errors?
 blackburn	 sonney2k http://snipt.org/ugTg8 these one I guess
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well no wonder - you serialize a SGVector / Matrix but cast it into a SGObject
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you think some old branches should be removed?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah yes and some application too :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so fix is just to do m_parameters->add(&vec, "vectors", "The vectors.")
@sonney2k	blackburn, which?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sailfish
 blackburn	all commented
 blackburn	no idea who will ever fix it
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm tending to add my road sign recognition application
 blackburn	cause it seems I'm not going to participate in any commercial development of it
@sonney2k	would be great
 blackburn	the only problem is hog computing thing
 blackburn	I borrowed some code and I have to implement it by myself probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: will my paper be considered by same reviewers?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've been thinking about more generic thread parameter class
 blackburn	and it seems pretty difficult to implement a map <string,anything>
 blackburn	without boost
 blackburn	but we may copy boost::any thoguh

 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I will change it to that then, but it is a pointer to a vector, not a vector exactly, I don't know if that makes a difference

@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't even have an idea how to serialize lists of SGVector etc
 n4nd0	sonney2k: take a look if you can a moment, these are the types of the members and how I am doing it
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ugUf4
 n4nd0	aham
@sonney2k	n4nd0, there is DynamicArray / DynArray but these cannot serialize the things beneath
 n4nd0	sonney2k: mmmm I see, so what is the best solution to take then?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah that cannot work
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well what you could do is use SGMatrix instead of SGVector (with number of columns being number of classes)
@sonney2k	and then we need a SGTensor for SGMatrix*
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actually we have that as SGNDArray
 n4nd0	sonney2k: tensors :O I got scared of those in a plasma physics course
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well call it 3 dimensional array then :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: tensors can be viewed just like N dimensional arrays ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it was nice until that part ... but it got dark later on :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, unsigned vs signed - it is just dangerous to do any math on unsigned
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can have a nice reconciliation in any case :P
@sonney2k	i.e. u-1 can be greater than you
@sonney2k	so I generally prefer to not use it (if there is no very good reason)
@sonney2k	s/you/u/
 blackburn	are you sure there is no performance reasons to use unsigned?
@sonney2k	yes 100%
 blackburn	sonney2k: you was right - 'you' works too
 blackburn	I mean I am definitely less than unsigned -1 ;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so is it clear how to resolve the problem?
@sonney2k	karlnapf1, could your reproduce the problem?
 karlnapf1	sonney2k, yes
 karlnapf1	there are memory errors
 n4nd0	sonney2k: not really :( I am looking for SGTensor but I don't manage to find it actually
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ah ok you say we need, not that we have it
 karlnapf1	just found the bad line ... I think this may be because new parameters are initialized with NULL, and when migrating I am reading from these
@sonney2k	n4nd0, use SGNDArray
 n4nd0	sonney2k: got it, SGMatrix for SGVector* and SGNDArray for SGMatrix* right?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is a bare container only though
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
 blackburn	too much serialization
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you know that java has no unsigned data types?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes but java is all about some other shit
 blackburn	they terribly don't care about performance
 n4nd0	:D
@sonney2k	well they care - but it is certainly harder with garbage collectors and no control of the exact size of the underlying data type and jit etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know about you - but I want to be able to just say 'dump shogun object' and have it on harddisk
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you mean?
 blackburn	I don't think java provides such easy way :)
 blackburn	rather some complex framework based on 300 library dependencies

@sonney2k	blackburn, about your paper - it is likely that same reviewers get it but you might also have new ones
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	thanks
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn: I don't see any method Parameter::add for SGNDArray, any workaround to do it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: implement it :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha looks legit :P I just found it curious that there had not been necessity of it before and wondered if there was sth alternative
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is pretty rarely when some method uses Nd array :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well don't implement it just yet - just use ndarray in your qda class and we later have to think of how to implement that stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: but there is some stuff using SGVector* and SGMatrix*, I think that ConjugateIndex for example uses sth similar
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh what a wonderful example of useless shit - Conjugate Index
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: are you angry with the world today man? :P
 blackburn	n4nd0: not really
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://www.waset.org/journals/waset/v13/v13-13.pdf
 blackburn	you should try to understand at least one sentence
 blackburn	it looks like they were translating it with some old version of google translate or so
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	that pisses me off so much man ... when I see a paper with really bad language it is like wtf!?
 n4nd0	but I don't really get it, isn't that controlled somehow?
 blackburn	n4nd0: probably it is a non-free journal
 blackburn	so they just publish some shit
 blackburn	just to publish
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham! so there are also journals where paying a fee one gets it published?
 n4nd0	more or less, just the general idea
 blackburn	probably they even pay for getting published I do not really know
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, are you working on any publication? I think I read sth about that in the conversation
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes, trying to get JMLR paper accepted
 blackburn	about dim reduction stuff

 mudit3774	Hi
 n4nd0	blackburn: :(
 n4nd0	mudit3774: hey!
 mudit3774	I am interested in applying for GSoC- 2012 for shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: you are the most friendly student ever
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	mudit3774: good! any project you are interested in, in particular?
 mudit3774	I have gone through the ideas page and I am interested in  Built generic multiclass learning framework
 mudit3774	I am sorry.. for being so formal :) ..but the whole idea and two lenghy publications made me write my intro like this
 mudit3774	:)
 n4nd0	mudit3774: good! I think the mentor in charge of it is around here
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	mudit3774: anyhow, have you already worked with shogun?
 mudit3774	Well no.. :( but I have some machine learning experience..
 mudit3774	Last year I was selected for University of Michigan (CSCS)
 mudit3774	and worked with complex adaptive systems
 n4nd0	mudit3774: that's good
 n4nd0	mudit3774: so I guess you may have come across it, it looks like this year it's important to have a small patch already done for the project in order to apply for GSoC
 mudit3774	Oh.. dats cool.. but do we have to give a link to the patch in our proposal
 mudit3774	?
 gsomix	sonney2k, there is good news.
 mudit3774	or we can do in during and after application period
 gsomix	*are
 mudit3774	I mean till 23rd MAr?
 n4nd0	mudit3774: I think there's no an strict deadlie for it
 n4nd0	mudit3774: but it would be good to have it done when you submit your proposal
 n4nd0	mudit3774: there is a section to write what experience do you have with shogun
 mudit3774	Well that would be a bit tough, I am still on the documentation..
@sonney2k	gsomix, ?
@sonney2k	gsomix, python3 works?
 n4nd0	mudit3774: I see ...
 mudit3774	but doen familiarity with the algorithm won't help? and is there an application template?
 n4nd0	mudit3774: in any case I would suggest you to fork the project, checkout the code locally and play around with it
@sonney2k	yes that is what you should do - and contribute (useful!) patches
@sonney2k	that is a big big plus
@sonney2k	basically everyone we accepted last year was contributing quite a bit before
 mudit3774	yeah.. that's what I was thinking, but then I thought of introducing myself first, anyways, will get back if I could contribute a useful patch, this mean having only algorithmic knowledge won't help much literature survey is not that important?
 n4nd0	mudit3774: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/shogun scroll quite a bit down to find the application template
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. Now it can be configured and compiled. Now this requires testing.
 gsomix	Too many 'now'. :(
 mudit3774	thanks..
 blackburn	mudit3774: what is your multiclass experience?
 mudit3774	Well,. I have not gone through the publications yet, but I worked on a project which used
 mudit3774	Ant Colony Optimization for controlling tree evolution in a RF agorithms
 mudit3774	I am guessing it is on similar lines
 blackburn	what is RF?
 mudit3774	Random Forest
 blackburn	ah I see
 mudit3774	It was used for ranking data according to variable importance
 blackburn	that idea is not really about trees nor forests..
 blackburn	but anyway any experience is valuable :)
 mudit3774	well I guess I have to well prepared before my next IRC visit then :)
 blackburn	I meant trees like random forest, C5.0 (different idea) or anything similar
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 mudit3774	I mean a through literature survey on the topic at least
 blackburn	I think nobody have to prepare visit IRC :)
 mudit3774	cool.. :) anyways thanks
 blackburn	I'm currently trying to come up with some idea
 blackburn	how can you contribute
 mudit3774	Well I have experience with Neural Networks, Bio inspired evolutionary algorithms and Random Forest..
 blackburn	random forest is pretty big project I guess
 mudit3774	In past GSoC and some projects under faculty members..
 blackburn	what kind of NNs are you able to implement easy?
 mudit3774	Well Back propogating..
 mudit3774	and some easier versions
 mudit3774	like
 mudit3774	hoppfield
 mudit3774	nns
 mudit3774	and yeah percetron based
 blackburn	we have averagedperceptron only here
 mudit3774	oh, well back propogation is quite popular and widely used
 blackburn	feel free to implement any then
 mudit3774	cool.. so I will try to work on that..
@sonney2k	gsomix, great work!
 gsomix	sonney2k, tomorrow(today? :)) I will be correcting our hacks and sending to the github.
