 n4nd0	so tomorrow I will make sure that this cover tree is actually giving the right answers
 n4nd0	and if it does, I will start to port it :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay
 n4nd0	good night :)
 blackburn	good night

 n4nd0	sonne|work: I finished cheking all the results, this cover tree gives the right output :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: at least the same as our current KNN with qsort
 n4nd0	and the interesting part, the query time is quite shorter!

 n4nd0	blackburn: hey, good morning!
 n4nd0	blackburn: I just sent a small pull request for KNN
 blackburn	n4nd0: morgen :)
 blackburn	damn I thought I pushed my changes
 n4nd0	I didn't see them in the repo
 n4nd0	no problem :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: a detail for the cover tree
 n4nd0	blackburn: should I substitute directly the current one we have or use another name (CoverTree2 for example)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so JL's covertree works right?
@sonney2k	morning blackburn
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is not JL's implementation
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is this one https://github.com/mbrucher/CoverTree
@sonney2k	hmmhh - admittedly I am a big fan of JL's stuff.
@sonney2k	what he does is reall fast(tm)
 blackburn	sonney2k: morgen. today is the day? ;)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah but I don't really understand that implementation
@sonney2k	that is the downside of his code - but just ask him then
@sonney2k	blackburn, not my day
 n4nd0	sonney2k: mailing list?
@sonney2k	tomorrow I would say :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, personal email
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, in any case, do you think it pays off to start porting this implementation?
@sonney2k	I would rather try to get JL's implementation to work
 n4nd0	ok ...
 n4nd0	this one presents a good improvement in time though
 n4nd0	Shogun's time: 00:00:00.328804
 n4nd0	CoverTree time 00:00:00.053650
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw I managed to beat all my competitors with 'brand new libedrt' :D
-!- uricamic [9320543b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.147.32.84.59] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	that is just 100 queries using 10000 training vectors
 n4nd0	sonney2k: another thing I was thinking about our KNN
 uricamic	Hi
 n4nd0	sonney2k: right now we have N?log(N) for every query, because we sort the distances from the query vector to all the training vectors
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well then benchmark JLs impl against this one
@sonney2k	uricamic, hi...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I can do that ... but we won't know if the results are correct
@sonney2k	are you back from vacations? did you think of some small patch?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so it won't fell safe in any case
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but you can compare the output to the qsort/other covertree
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, to the cover tree I am using now, the comparison is done
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am quite certain it is correct
 uricamic	sonney2k: yes, I plan to work on it this week, and I have one question
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah - I meant you can do the same with JL
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have tried a very long test (10000 training vector, 10000 queries with 5 neighbors) and it works
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no, I cannot do that with JL
@sonney2k	and the winner is the one we integrate
 uricamic	sonney2k: is it possible to write very simple interface for the libbmrm as a patch, or hsould I choose something different?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, why not?
@sonney2k	uricamic, I would prefer something completely different
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have some *small* idea for uricamic?
 uricamic	sonney2k: ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: when I query 10 points with k = 10 with JL, I get 10 neighbors for the first query
 n4nd0	sonney2k: 1 for each of the others ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I proposed parzen stuff before
@sonney2k	uricamic, ^
@sonney2k	so feel free
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it worths?
@sonney2k	uricamic, other relatively simple algos are also ok
 uricamic	ok, I will start with the Parzen windows
 uricamic	ok
 uricamic	thanks
 blackburn	ah or some nadaraya-watson or etc
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but I can try to check again if I am doing correctly this test, but I think so
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	for example some iterative method for ridge regression (not computing pinv)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well ask JL directly in CC me in the email why this is the case and give him your code snippet
 n4nd0	sonney2k: good idea :) thank you
@sonney2k	uricamic, that was for you: you could for example also do some iterative method for ridge regression (not computing pinv)
@sonney2k	if that is more in your field of expertise
@sonney2k	as optimization guru :)
 uricamic	sonney2k: ok, I will look at it and then decide
@sonney2k	uricamic, just look in the shogun/regression/ directory... these all are pinv based things
 uricamic	sonney2k: ok, thanks
 n4nd0	sonney2k: about the other strategy for KNN, the qsort one, right now we are in N?log(N) but that can be done in N easy
 n4nd0	sonney2k: instead of sorting all the distances and taking the K shortest
 n4nd0	sonney2k: loop through all the distances and keep a record of the K shortest one found
 blackburn	n4nd0: really, how? ;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes that would be faster for small k
 blackburn	it won't be N still I mean
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I guess no one is using k>11
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is N*k
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it is something like N?k?log(k)
 blackburn	depends on structure you will use to store neighbors
 blackburn	but with lame way it is even Nk^2
 n4nd0	using just a vector of k elements
 n4nd0	that you order in every iteration
 n4nd0	is just N?k?log(k)
 n4nd0	and I know nothing lamer than that ...
 blackburn	but you would need to compare with elements
 blackburn	in worst case with each element
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I thought you meant sth like going through the N elements and keeping a history of the k neighreast
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, that is the idea
 blackburn	n4nd0: I used fibonacci heap for that before :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what complexity gives with fibonacci heap?
 n4nd0	I normally solve this problem using std::set
 blackburn	minimum is log N amortized
 n4nd0	you insert in log(k)
 blackburn	so k*log N
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	insert is O(1) in the fib heap
 n4nd0	sonney2k: bye
 n4nd0	blackburn: so you insert in O(1) and later you sort it?
 blackburn	yes something like that
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	actually you could measure it too
 n4nd0	but when you said
 n4nd0	09:22 < blackburn> but you would need to compare with elements
 n4nd0	09:22 < blackburn> in worst case with each element
 n4nd0	you are playing there with worst-time complexity of qsort??
 blackburn	no
 n4nd0	if not, I don't see what you mean
 blackburn	okay let us have x1,x2,x3,x4,...
 blackburn	when you collect neighbors
 blackburn	let we have some collection already
 blackburn	xi1,xi2,xi3
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	and if we need to know if new vector x is a neighbor
 blackburn	we would need to compare all these distances right?
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn	why?
 n4nd0	you just compare with the one that gives the largest distance
 n4nd0	among these neighbors
 n4nd0	that's why you need to have it sorted
 blackburn	sorted?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	so you have this collection of k tentative neighbors
 n4nd0	sorted
 blackburn	okay and if you have distance 1.5
 blackburn	while largest is 5
 blackburn	and smallest is 1.25
 n4nd0	then 5 pops out
 blackburn	you would need to compare to place it?
 n4nd0	1.5 enters
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	the largest goes out
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	the new one goes in, and you sort again
 blackburn	okay got it
 n4nd0	N?k?log(k) :D
 n4nd0	"assuming" that qsort is n?log(n) for n elements
 n4nd0	so we will normally have complexity N because N >> k
 n4nd0	and that would make our current KNN to work in O(N) instead of O(N?log(N))
 n4nd0	blackburn: did I convince you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: just measure :)
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that is my homework for today
 n4nd0	I am going to change it, measure and mail JL
 blackburn	yeah a lot of things to do
-!- nickon [~noneedtok@dD5774105.access.telenet.be] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: I was thinking of that because I remember you said that scikits people wrote that our KNN is slow
 n4nd0	blackburn: and AFAIK they don't have cover tree either
 blackburn	n4nd0: kdtree
 blackburn	or balltree
 n4nd0	I think kd-trees work fine in low dimensionality problems
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have just realized that KNN comes with SG_PROGRESS, how is that used?
 blackburn	I would avoid kdtree
 blackburn	n4nd0: knn.io.enable_progress()
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, thank you
 n4nd0	blackburn: why would you avoid kd-trees?
 blackburn	n4nd0: that thing should be everywhere actually
 blackburn	n4nd0: because it would work only for simplefeatures
 sonne|work	n4nd0: mail JL first then start the play stuff :)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: btw JL is located in NY so you cannot quickly get an answer
 n4nd0	sonne|work: :( haha ok, I was starting to play first, such a kid :P
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the sooner I mail him, the better then
 blackburn	sonne|work: is there anything except covertree and vw he has we can integrate?
 sonne|work	blackburn: his vw stuff changed completely
 sonne|work	they have some massiviely parallel thing in there now
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have seen that - bfgs-l is here now
 n4nd0	particle filters! :P
-!- av3ngr [av3ngr@nat/redhat/x-fslqwfzaqdfhtuml] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 n4nd0	sonne|work: there is sth weird, JL's non-templated implementation gives the correct number of neighbors while the templated (the one I was using for my test) not
 sonne|work	then sb introduced a bug :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am going to try to find out why is this, the mail may wait
 n4nd0	yeah, either I did it in the test or it was in this templated version
 sonne|work	n4nd0: maybe you can then even compare the 2 cover trees first
 n4nd0	I think the first alternative is more likely
 n4nd0	sonne|work: which two ones?
 sonne|work	the one you dig up and JLs
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please remind me how does non-templated stuff works?
 n4nd0	blackburn: the point is fixed to: typedef float* point
 blackburn	n4nd0: how distances are computed then?
 sonne|work	floats are really crazy ... http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/05/floating-point-complexities/
 n4nd0	blackburn: normal Euclidean distance
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think I didn't get the point of the question sorry
 blackburn	n4nd0: hardcoded? can you change it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: you mean like how many elements do they use?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no how hard it could be to adapt non-templated?
 blackburn	or in other words is it any possible ?
 n4nd0	blackburn: so take a look to the distance function for example

 wiking	anybody knows how can i force an ext3 fs to be clean?
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	no idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://snipt.org/uhGh8
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that by changing that function that can be done
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	ok
 n4nd0	wiking: no idea either
 wiking	hehehe trying to hack with tune2fs and dumpfs :>
 sonne|work	wiking: hi ... what errors where you getting with clang? because here it compiles fine w/ clang...
 n4nd0	blackburn: there are things I don't get anyway
 wiking	sonne|work: will give you the list
 n4nd0	blackburn: if I set k = 9, I get 10 neighbors
 wiking	sonne|work: just now i'm trying to save my work while the FS is collapsing :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: the k used is the k given +1
 blackburn	n4nd0: Iguess you get object itself?
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham, let me check
 sonne|work	wiking: why do you want the fs to become clean
 sonne|work	wiking: just mount it
 wiking	sonne|work: i cannot boot
 wiking	just in single user mode
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't really know if it is because of that
 sonne|work	wiking: then boot in single user mode copy stuff over and run fsck
 wiking	hehehe i'm actually on it
 wiking	the problem here is that it's an nfs
 wiking	a
 wiking	and i don't have space to save that much data only when i have network
 wiking	but i think
 wiking	iiii think i've made it now :)
 wiking	damn raid controllers...

 n4nd0	it was my bad, there were some bugs in my implementation of the point I was using for JL
 n4nd0	I am sorry for the confusion
 sonne|work	:)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so now benchmark please :D
 sonne|work	then we can decide
 n4nd0	sonne|work: there is one issue though
 n4nd0	I believe that JL doesn't give the points in order (closest to farthe)
 n4nd0	the neighbors I mean
 n4nd0	so a test to ensure that the results are correct would take me a bit more time
 n4nd0	we can benchmark it though and assume that the results are correct (they must be)
 sonne|work	well try if they are exactly the same...
 sonne|work	then you know for sure that JL's covertree gives (un)ordered results
 sonne|work	however, it is very cheap if you would just compute the distance to these k points and sort accordingly (compared to all the n log(n) stuff before)

 Johannes__	Hello, where can i find the shogun-java-modular package the installation guide talks about on ubuntu?
 Johannes__	I can find some of the others through the usual channels but not that one.
 n4nd0	Johannes__: hey! it doesn't appear directly in my apt-get either, is it said around there to include any special repository for apt-get??
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I got results of the benchmark :)
 Johannes__	n4nd0: Doesen't mention any special repository to include as far as I can see.
 n4nd0	Johannes__: aham, then I don't really know
 n4nd0	Johannes__: have you considered installing from source?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: JL's is considerably faster
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it is reasonable to some extent since in his version the algorihtms for creation of the tree and query are batch algorihtms
 Johannes__	Considered, yes but will probably look around for alternatives first, tried the macport install on my laptop without success aswell ;p
 n4nd0	Johannes__: but you are on ubuntu or in mac?
 Johannes__	both, the shogun-java-modular question was in regards to ubuntu
 n4nd0	Johannes__: ahm
 n4nd0	Johannes__: anyway, it should not be hard to install in ubuntu from source, just say it if you want some help with that
 Johannes__	Yea perhaps that's the way to go, we'll see. Thanks for the offer and answers regardless :)
 n4nd0	no problem :)
 sonne|work	hi gsomix
 sonne|work	n4nd0: with batch you mean - one has to specify *all* train data at once and *all* test data at once?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yes, both for the training data and the test data
 n4nd0	sonne|work: actually the way it works is doing a cover tree for the test data too
 sonne|work	so you end up with k*T indices?
 sonne|work	uhh and what are the memory requirements for that?
 n4nd0	I have not measured it myself
 n4nd0	but in the paper they say that a cover tree needs O(n) in memory
 sonne|work	ok
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uhHe8
 sonne|work	sounds great...
 n4nd0	the build time of the other's cover tree really sucks
 sonne|work	impressive
 sonne|work	build time?
 sonne|work	why? what?
 sonne|work	you mean compile time
 n4nd0	no
 sonne|work	or construction of the tree?
 n4nd0	to create the cover tree
 sonne|work	well I think it is pretty clear that we want JL's tree :)
 n4nd0	yeah ... bad new for my health status :P
 n4nd0	sonne|work: so how would you like that we use it? use the same code and provide wrappers?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: is it better to re-write?
 n4nd0	btw, I didn't check the correctnes of the results in JL yet!
 n4nd0	I just assumed that they are ok
 sonne|work	n4nd0: will I said so upfront :D
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	n4nd0: it depends - a shallow wrapper is easier to maintain in case there are fixes to JL's covertree

 puffin444	hello
 PhilTillet	hello
 puffin444	Do you know when/if Sergey or Soeren will be on IRC?
 PhilTillet	I have no idea :p
 PhilTillet	I think they are eagerly waiting for the number of slots to be announced =D
 blackburn	puffin444: I'm partially available
 blackburn	I am first one ;)
 puffin444	So blackburn it looks like I broke the build :(
 blackburn	I've seen the mail
 blackburn	first of S heh
 blackburn	let me check logs
 blackburn	puffin444: does it work on your machine?
 puffin444	yes
 puffin444	That's what I don't understand
 blackburn	any errors detected by valgrind?
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@npasserelle10.minet.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 puffin444	There are no memory leaks. However, it does complain about freeing memory. This happens to all the examples though.
 puffin444	In Valgrind
 blackburn	puffin444: do you copy the covariance matrix when you return it?
 puffin444	Hmm... maybe not.
 blackburn	I mean is it a member?
 puffin444	No.
 blackburn	ah no
 puffin444	But the problem is that I can't reproduce this error on my system, so I don't really know how to fix it.
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	let me try to compile and test that
 blackburn	puffin444: actually the problem is some matrix is free'd two times
 puffin444	Aah I see
 puffin444	blackburn, I am extremely sorry to do this, but I need to leave the IRC immediately
 blackburn	puffin444: no problem
 puffin444	I'll check and find this double-freed matrix.

@sonney2k	hey therre
 n4nd0	hi
@sonney2k	ohh the man with the fast covertree :)
 n4nd0	haha not yet :)
 n4nd0	I won't say until we can use it within shogun
 n4nd0	;)
@sonney2k	hmmh does anyone know when the business day of pacific time is over
@sonney2k	looks like in 5-6 hours but I guess at google they work a bit longer so lets say 8 hrs ;-)
 n4nd0	I am around the channel in case I get something, I have seen you there too
@sonney2k	no I will go to bed need to recover a bit
 n4nd0	we'll know tomorrow then
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rc80508e / src/shogun/mathematics/Math.cpp : Fix compile error in twonorm() when lapack is not available - http://git.io/zvw5Qg
* gsomix have returned from dance floor.
 PhilTillet	hey sonney2k
@sonney2k	hey
 wiking	oops sonney2k sorry about that bug :(
@sonney2k	yeah luckily we have that buildbot (last year we didn't and that was really causing us quite some headache
 wiking	dooooh
 wiking	javac] symbol  : constructor RealFeatures(org.jblas.DoubleMatrix)
 wiking	    [javac] location: class org.shogun.RealFeatures
 wiking	how come?
@sonney2k	got to leave train
 wiking	was working till now
 wiking	doh these days...
@sonney2k	cu
 wiking	cya
 gsomix	good night
@sonney2k	nite gsomix
@sonney2k	wiking, what is the exact error?
@sonney2k	seems a little unspecific...
 n4nd0	good night gsomix
 wiking	sonney2k: i think i had some trouble with detecting jblas
 wiking	now i'm recompiling and i guess it'll work now
@sonney2k	not in CLASSPATH ?
@sonney2k	hmmhh
 wiking	it was actually
@sonney2k	wiking, are you using java interface of shogun?
 wiking	i mean the problem was with
 wiking	that javac was defined to be gcj
 wiking	and that had some troubles detecting the jblas (it's at default location)
@sonney2k	hmmhh maybe
 wiking	but now trying with sun's javac
 wiking	ok now it's fixed
 wiking	only thing now is
 wiking	no that is my error
 wiking	ok now compiled fine
 wiking	yeah i'm using sometimes java interface
@sonney2k	wiking, so are you using the java interace?
@sonney2k	ahh ok
 wiking	yep yep
 wiking	need to
 wiking	i have some features coming from hadoop
@sonney2k	I haven't used it except for crafting some examples
@sonney2k	so all feedback welcome
 wiking	and i don't want to do constantly a transforming the features into some other formats
@sonney2k	wiking, btw you should be even able to serialize a shogun object from java and load it later from python :)
 wiking	so in order to be able to simply use hadoop created sequence file i just use java interface
 wiking	let's see multi class linear machine
 wiking	with homo kernel mapping :))
@sonney2k	heh
 wiking	mm i wonder what's happening
 wiking	still calculating :)))
 wiking	i thought it's a fast linear machine
 wiking	can it be that this linear machine is slower than a kernel machine with linear kernel?
@sonney2k	wiking, liblinear?
@sonney2k	no should be very fast
