 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the error?
 n4nd0	blackburn, I can paste in another snippet them
 blackburn	lets do it
 n4nd0	blackburn, compiling :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, takes little time
 blackburn	did you fix everything? if so just do pull req
 blackburn	I'll pull
 blackburn	push
 blackburn	merge
 blackburn	anything
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	too much words for similar operations
 n4nd0	there it goes
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uIgb0
 n4nd0	haha, yes they are
 n4nd0	no, I didn't fix these other ones
 n4nd0	the use functions/methods with the wrong number of parameters
 n4nd0	but when I changed them I started getting problems with the types and didn't know what the correct was then
 blackburn	float64_t* H = kernel->get_kernel_matrix<float64_t>(m, n, NULL);
 blackburn	should be
 blackburn	SGMatrix<float64_t> H = kernel->get_kernel_matrix();
 blackburn	then m=H.num_rows;
 blackburn	n=H.num_cols;
 blackburn	line 61 could stay
 blackburn	will work
 blackburn	the last thing on line 85
 blackburn	H.destroy_matrix();
 blackburn	instead of SG_FREE(H);
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	minor things due to change in the interface, aren't they?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	we are still on the way to SGMatrix things
 n4nd0	no problem
 n4nd0	the other macro
 n4nd0	lines 82-84 SG_FREE
 n4nd0	are ok?
 blackburn	sure
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	alphas, ul, ub are allocated using SG_MALLOC
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	so they should be free'd using SG_FREE, it is ok
 n4nd0	make sense :)
 n4nd0	will you push the canges to master at the end?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	exactly
 n4nd0	let me check the next errors
 n4nd0	maybe I can continue checking them
 n4nd0	and fix them if they are like these ones
 blackburn	99% they are similar
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	okay it is pretty late here
 blackburn	n4nd0: feel free to do a pull request
 blackburn	me or soeren will merge if it is ok
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	blackburn, any special name for the branch?
 blackburn	you may use some special branch if you need :)
 blackburn	but not really required
 blackburn	it makes no difference for us
 blackburn	anyway we will merge into master
 n4nd0	so if just pull a local version (not a cloned one like the one I have) I would just work in my master?
 blackburn	hmm you have to work in your fork
 blackburn	did you make it?
 n4nd0	I cloned the repo
 n4nd0	but I am not sure if that would be my fork
 blackburn	no, it is just clone
 n4nd0	I mean, I did git clone git:://....
 blackburn	check this
 blackburn	http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
 blackburn	you just have to create your fork, then commit and push your fixes
 blackburn	and create a pull request to main repo
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	aha
 blackburn	fork is just a copy of repo owned by you
 n4nd0	the pull request is the thing new for me
 n4nd0	what's the difference with a clone?
 blackburn	it is just request for merge from your fork to main repository
 blackburn	with a clone you can't push any changes
 blackburn	if you don't have rights
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	as for fork, you own it
 blackburn	so you may push everything you want
 blackburn	and then ask us to merge it
 blackburn	I have clone but do commits directly
 blackburn	it wouldn't work for users without write permission
 blackburn	okay have to go now
 blackburn	I'm sure you get into it ;)
 blackburn	see you tomorrow

 n4nd0	blackburn, hey! sorry about the identation, it looked good on my editor :-O
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have fixed it and pushed it to my fork, should I do the pull request again or is it not necessary?
 blackburn	n4nd0: afaik it is sufficient
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	n4nd0: allright, will merge now
 blackburn	here you go
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r4af1dff / (8 files in 3 dirs): Merge https://github.com/iglesias/shogun (+8 more commits...) - http://git.io/6I45cA
 blackburn	n4nd0: cheers, your first commits ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn, :-) it feels good
 n4nd0	blackburn, I will see now if I can make the lpboost classifier work for the face detection example
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	would be easy I think
 blackburn	to use I mean :)
 n4nd0	I think I have more or less the idea how to do it
 n4nd0	but the problem is that I don't really know if it will work out properly
 n4nd0	I tried out the example classifier_lpboost
 n4nd0	and it doesn't work when the number of training examples is large
 n4nd0	I am afraid that it might a limitation given by the cplex solver, when I run matlab I get this message
 n4nd0	The CPLEX Optimizers will solve problems up to 500 variables and 500 constraints.
 blackburn	damn it sounds like CPLEX is useless crap
 n4nd0	:(
 n4nd0	there is a thing that I don't really get of it, shogun is an open source project right?
 n4nd0	why then does it use this solver that is proprietary software?
 blackburn	why not? :)
 n4nd0	haha don't know, I found it odd
 n4nd0	but yead, indeed ... why not?
 blackburn	shogun has a lot of different solvers
 n4nd0	I am off now, talk to you later
 blackburn	see ya
