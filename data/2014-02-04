 sonne|work	lisitsyn, wiking - do you have the bootstrap valgrind thing somewhere?
@wiking	sonney2k: just a sec
@wiking	sonne|work: ^
@wiking	besser82: mmm seems that patch wasn't really working out :(
@wiking	set(MEMCHECK....
@wiking	sonne|work: this is how it would look like with lisitsyn's xslt: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/test.html
@wiking	sonne|work: currently i'm just looking into how we can use the xslt from the httpd server
 lisitsyn	wiking: I can make it collapsing in/collapsing out
 lisitsyn	and add other info as well
 lisitsyn	but a bit later
@wiking	lisitsyn: sonne|work could tell you the requirements :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'm just executing :P
* wiking wonders who's handling http requests http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yes please more details about the actual error would be nice and of course some summary - I mean how many leaks in total etc
@wiking	twistd or nginx
 sonne|work	wiking: twistd
 sonne|work	wiking: lisitsyn - in any case we need this list to be down to 0
@wiking	sonne|work: lemme check how we can hack twisted
@wiking	sonne|work: or maybe the easier way so that we can actually upgrade buildbot that i add an extra task to memcheck job
@wiking	sonne|work: after uploading it'll run the xslt over the uploeded xml and done..
 sonne|work	wiking: yes exactly
 sonne|work	do it as extra task and put the script on the buildbot
@wiking	what's the command to execute something on buildmaster and not on slave ? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: urgs - then do it on fatbot
@wiking	sonne|work: do we want then the xml on master at all?
@wiking	sonne|work: since we can just upload the generated html then

@wiking	sonne|work: i've got this from kevin: "I want to be able to run demos of the changes to the shogun site that I am working on so that I can get feedback from everyone easily."
@wiking	anyhow his account is done
@wiking	once i know what other access he needs i'll do it asap
 sonne|work	wiking: thanks
@wiking	besser82: ping?

 besser82	wiking:  pong!
@wiking	besser82: ok so the MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS works good
@wiking	besser82: only thing is that it overwrites the default command options
@wiking	i've tried everything
@wiking	LIST(APPEND MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS "...")
@wiking	SET(MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS "${MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS} ..."_
@wiking	s/_/)/g
@wiking	but neither of them worked :<
 besser82	wiking:  How about with CTEST_  prefixed?!?
@wiking	if i set somehow the MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS then i loose all the default options
@wiking	besser82: been there done that :)
@wiking	same
 besser82	wiking:  that sucks :(
@wiking	i mean within CMakeLists
@wiking	when i do MESSAGE(${MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS})
@wiking	or MESSAGE(${CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS})
@wiking	it does not exist
 besser82	wiking:  /back
 besser82	wiking:  lemme investigate about that a bit...
@wiking	besser82: and it's all the same if i do this in CTestConfig.cmake
@wiking	besser82: according to github search the only way to solve this is basically put there all the commands i want
@wiking	i.e. the default ones as well
 besser82	wiking: not so good...  :(
 besser82	wiking: perhaps there is a way to workaround that...
@wiking	besser82: mmm maybe but seems people on github couldn't find it either
@wiking	let me know if u have some soluton
@wiking	until then i'll go with the above mentioned one
 besser82	wiking:  I'll do  :)
@wiking	no fucking way

@wiking	done
@wiking	it cannot handle -1 as a return code
@wiking	i mean valgrind
@wiking	only positive

@wiking	most probably we'll have to move this task to the debian-sid bot as that one has a newer valgrind that can return error for under mems as well
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't mind...

@wiking	besser82: what was the cmd line arg u mentioned yesterday for valgrind ?
@wiking	trying to figure out whether 3.8 has that?
@wiking	besser82: what's the valgrind version in fc18/
@wiking	?

 besser82	wiking:  FC18 is EOL  :)
 besser82	wiking:  FC19 has 3.8.1
 besser82	wiking:  FC20 is 3.9.0
@wiking	besser82: --undef-value-errors should be yes by default
 besser82	wiking:  then unfortunately there isn't any option for that, yet...
 besser82	wiking:  if you need FCxx-tarball lemme know; I can provide prestine ones  ;)
@wiking	nah i'm trying to force that option
@wiking	but tha already exist in 3.7
@wiking	we'll see if that makes any difference
@wiking	if no then there's no option for it unfortunately

 sonne|work	wiking: and excellent that it works now :))
@wiking	i think some of them are false positive
 sonne|work	btw MulticlassOCASTest is failing on OSX simply due to a bug like this
@wiking	as some of them are due to some thing in eigen
 sonne|work	Uninitialized Memory Conditional (66)
@wiking	yeah that's for sure not a false positive

 lisitsyn	sonne|work: will full log work?
 lisitsyn	I can do that a bit later tomorrow
 lisitsyn	otherwise simple <xsl:value-of select="Log">
 lisitsyn	can help here
@wiking	ok done
@wiking	lot of entrance examples generated
@wiking	i mean entrance issues
 sonne|work	wiking: thanks
 sonne|work	so now only mentors / ideas list / proposal and done

 HeikoS1	sonne|work: just redoing this bill and was wondering if you had the old document floating around?
 sonne|work	what are you redoing exactly?
 HeikoS1	the invoice itself
 HeikoS1	since they want us to do that
 HeikoS1	they sent the 2012 one
 HeikoS1	there is a list of things on there
 HeikoS1	and then the pdfs attached
 sonne|work	well I submitted it online this time that is the issue
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: did you see that?
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	will never do that with their online form again but only locally
 HeikoS1	I see, did you mention anything else than in the pdf with the receipts?
 sonne|work	yes sure
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: Ill just write one up from the receipts
 sonne|work	students / mentor stipedn
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: write sth up and send it to me then
 sonne|work	so I can check
 HeikoS1	ok
 sonne|work	we should get 8x 500$ for students + ~2000$ for the summit
@wiking	btw shouldnt we release this thing publicly? or only after when the e.V. is done...?
 sonne|work	wiking: what thing?
@wiking	sonne|work: accounting for each year
 sonne|work	wiking: for e.V. we need to do a tax decl.
@wiking	although i have no clue what are the reqs for a .de e.V. but for example mozilla foundation publishes on the end of each year the accounting of the fundation
@wiking	namely that google just dumped them like another 10M+ USD :P
 sonne|work	hehe
@wiking	but none the less maybe it would be a good thing to do as well... just to assure the openness...

@wiking	well that's alright

@wiking	something like 'purge SGRefObject and SGDynamicRefObjectArray'
@wiking	ok i'm on it
@wiking	ok done
@wiking	thnx

@wiking	thoralf: if they are not referenced
@wiking	then we should just go ahead and remove
@wiking	thoralf: but it'll be a good entrance task :)
@wiking	thoralf: somebody will do it for sure
@wiking	as it's quite easy

@wiking	time shall not be wasted on such small issues since gsoc is approaching :)

@wiking	any idea of it's status, is it still valid or it's obsolete?

@wiking	woah
@wiking	we have a looot of bugz
@wiking	thoralf: thnx for confirming!
@wiking	if u think plz mark it as an entrance task
@wiking	we are for sure going to have some structured hacking this year as well
@wiking	..

 thoralf	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1813 <-- I did a few tests to (empirically) confirm that my fix didn't change the results.
 thoralf	Shall we merge?
 thoralf	Michal wrote "otherwise I think that it can be merged now."

@wiking	lisitsyn: so i've been reading this http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ_Update
@wiking	lisitsyn: basically we can do what i was saying the other day
@wiking	lisitsyn: once we have the new framework, i.e. the modular thingy
@wiking	lisitsyn: then we can create a 'package' of gpl modules
 lisitsyn	oh alright
@wiking	and there we can put all the stuff that we cannot release under bsd
 lisitsyn	I don't mind training part to be gpl
@wiking	'In order to use the GPL-covered plug-ins, the main program must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when the main program is distributed for use with these plug-ins'
@wiking	bsd is a GPL-compatible license
 lisitsyn	but I really do want to be able to give_me_fking_fast_and_reliable_shogun_classifier()
@wiking	so basically this way if somebody doesn't mind gpl stuff they can use the whole thing as is

@wiking	if somebody wants bsd only ... well he/she has to go around it
 lisitsyn	yeah good
@wiking	i.e. reimplement the thing with bsd license
@wiking	but none the less if we can at least get the core of shogun to be bsd
@wiking	then we are already half way done
@wiking	and just put together a gpl package
@wiking	and voila
@wiking	so we should be good
@wiking	but to be able to do this
@wiking	we need like 6-7 more people to sign the form
@wiking	as they are really big contributors
@wiking	these are: Sebastian Henschel, Shashwat Lal Das, Jonas Behr, Baozeng Ding, Christian Widmer, puffin444, Alesis Novik, Andre Noll, Alexander Zien, Justin Patera, Alexander Binder, Michal Uricar,
@wiking	lol

 thoralf	Not related to my PR, right?
@wiking	hheheh
@wiking	let's check :)
@wiking	but ithink yes

@wiking	right
@wiking	amazing
@wiking	:D
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1813
@wiking	shogun-buildbot_: force build --branch=develop 'deb4 - python3'
 shogun-buildbot_	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@wiking	thoralf: it'll fix itself dont worry :) (idle
@wiking	7 pending0
@wiking	it's just the stupid way buildbot is now building these prs
@wiking	i mean commits
@wiking	we'll se after 7 builds
@wiking	wtf is up :)
 thoralf	That's why you should never release after 4pm. ;)

@wiking	thoralf: if u do a multiclass test
@wiking	thoralf: u could create gaussian blobs and then just do a multiclass over the
@wiking	m
@wiking	;)
 thoralf	That's right.
@wiking	check tests/unit/features/DataGenerators_unittest.cc for examples
 thoralf	But it's basically a test for the solvers that they behave sane if #cp-buffer < #needed-iterations.
@wiking	hehe
@wiking	yeah i get that part
 thoralf	You think I could have avoided the helper-methods for creating dummy-data, right?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	although we should create helper functions
@wiking	within utest
 thoralf	It's accidently somehow pathological... I dunno why. :)
@wiking	as i'm sure other utest would/will need gaussian blobs
 thoralf	Anyway, I've created an example who to use parametrized tests.
@wiking	that's great
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1854
 thoralf	It wasn't that easy - gtest seems to be a bit picky.
@wiking	w8 for travis
@wiking	and if it's all good merge it
 thoralf	No hurry.
@wiking	thoralf: btw python3 bot went back to be green... ;)

 thoralf	The PR contains way more issues than just the test, because I accidently squashed them.  So it's not that obvious and I recommend someone reviewing it...
 thoralf	If it's too bad, I'll try to isolete the changes.
