 sanuj	lisitsyn, ping
 lisitsyn	sanuj: hey
 sanuj	this is fine right?
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/swig-tutorial/tree/master/tutorial-3
 sanuj	my toy swig interfaces for template
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah looks ok
 lisitsyn	sanuj: there is no python example though
 lisitsyn	did you manage to make it work?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	build it setup.py
 sanuj	import square
 sanuj	sq = square.SquareInt(5)
 sanuj	sq.area()
 sanuj	= 25
 sanuj	:P
 sanuj	all this is working
 lisitsyn	ok cool
 lisitsyn	now should be easy to make tag thing work :)
 sanuj	yes i'll move on to that now
 sanuj	this turned out to be easier than i thought
 sanuj	:)

 sanuj	lisitsyn, still there?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes
 sanuj	in my prototype
 sanuj	i'm using tags to get instead of string
 sanuj	we had discussed this earlier i guess
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/src/shogun/SGObject.hpp
 sanuj	can't we infer the type from the argument tag instead of casting it
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes it should work ok with tags
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you just have to 'instantiate' these gets
 lisitsyn	for specific types like int, double
 lisitsyn	but as they have different argument types
 lisitsyn	it should work
 sanuj	alright, i'll try

@HeikoS	sanuj: yes you can
 lisitsyn	sanuj: wazuup
 sanuj	HeikoS, about GMM cookbook?
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn	make shogun grate again
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, getting that include error
 lisitsyn	ah sorry
 sanuj	lisitsyn, look up ^^
 lisitsyn	well it looks like the path is wrong :)
 sanuj	cmake is able to build it without swig
 lisitsyn	src/shogun/Tag.hpp
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i'll share the code on github
 lisitsyn	I don't think src should be there
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i called python setup.py from a folder which has src
 lisitsyn	why do you use setup.py?
 sanuj	swig docs
 lisitsyn	I mean in shogun we already build it with cmake
 lisitsyn	why other approach?
 sanuj	just for testing
 sanuj	swig docs suggested setup.py so i used it to build my toy examples
 sanuj	i'll try to build it with cmake
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ok just show me what's changed or errors you ge
 sanuj	okay

 sanuj	lisitsyn, ping
@wiking	hel
@wiking	o
@wiking	:)
@wiking	wazza
@wiking	sanuj: you pinged me?
 sanuj	wiking, hi :)
 sanuj	i pinged you a while back
 sanuj	abt some error
 sanuj	but now it's solved :)
@wiking	ah ok, sorry wasn't around
 sanuj	cool :)
 sanuj	wiking, swig interface is sort of working for my string-tag prototype
 sanuj	with some problems
@wiking	anything i can help with
@wiking	meaning with the problems/
@wiking	?
 sanuj	i'll share the code first
 sanuj	let me push it on github
 sanuj	have you seen my prototype?
@wiking	kk
@wiking	noup sorry
 sanuj	okay :)

 sanuj	wiking, this is how the .i file looks
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/src/interfaces/shogun.i
 sanuj	and the concerned classes are
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/src/shogun/Tag.hpp
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/src/shogun/SGObject.hpp
 sanuj	in python
 sanuj	when i do
 sanuj	obj = SGObject()
@wiking	sanuj: for(std::unordered_map<std::string, Any*>::iterator it = tag_map.begin(); it != tag_map.end(); ++it)
@wiking	for_each? :)
 sanuj	obj.set(....) doesn't work
@wiking	it's much shorter
@wiking	is this from python interface?
@wiking	i suppose, right?
@wiking	ok lemme pull
 sanuj	sure i'll do that
@wiking	and try to compile
 sanuj	yes it's from python interface
@wiking	ok the cmake files will need some love
@wiking	but lemme try it on linu
@wiking	*linux
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	i don't know much cmake
@wiking	dont worry we'll fix it
 sanuj	make build dir in tags-string
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	trying that
@wiking	the problem is
@wiking	ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (init_shogun)
 sanuj	import shogun worked for me
 sanuj	in python
@wiking	ah i think i have a problem with having another version
@wiking	of shogun in the path
 sanuj	go in tags-string/build/src/interfaces and then import
 sanuj	you will have to do something about the path
@wiking	yep yep
@wiking	i know
@wiking	i'm just saying
 sanuj	:D
@wiking	that i have another version of shogun in the path
 sanuj	i know you know
@wiking	hence the meixup
 sanuj	:P
@wiking	mmm
 lisitsyn	why
 lisitsyn	what's wrong with set?
@wiking	oh ok
@wiking	i see
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	Traceback (most recent call last):

@wiking	AttributeError: set
@wiking	coz swig uses that nice lambda
@wiking	to get the object's param
@wiking	(attribute i meant0
 lisitsyn	was it ignored
 lisitsyn	because python has 'set'?
@wiking	nono
@wiking	it doesn't find that 'set'
 lisitsyn	yes but why?
@wiking	how's tag added to SGObject
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	which repo
@wiking	ah wait
@wiking	i've fucked up the thing
@wiking	sanuj: should it be
 sanuj	the following perfectly in c++
 sanuj	SGObject obj;
 sanuj	Tag<int> length_tag("side");
 sanuj	obj.set(length_tag, 10);
@wiking	sanuj: how did you create Tag<int> in python
 sanuj	%template(TagInt) Tag<int>;
@wiking	TagInt
@wiking	ok
 sanuj	oh i think why
 sanuj	because
 sanuj	template <typename T>
 sanuj	    void set(Tag<T> tag, T value);
 sanuj	it's a template method which are treated differently in swig
 lisitsyn	yes you have to instantiate
 lisitsyn	set<T>
 lisitsyn	for some types
 sanuj	will do it now
 sanuj	sorry for the trouble wiking
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	everything is working now
 sanuj	but
 sanuj	obj = SGObject()
 sanuj	length_tag = TagInt("side")
 sanuj	obj.setInt(length_tag, 10)
 sanuj	a = obj.getInt(length_tag)
 sanuj	a is <Swig Object of type 'int *' at 0x7f7c00f13de0>
 sanuj	so 3 + obj.getInt(length_tag) won't work
 sanuj	this is because
 sanuj	template <typename T>
 sanuj	T& get(Tag<T> tag);
 sanuj	more specifically
 sanuj	template <typename T>
 sanuj	T& SGObject::get(Tag<T> tag)
 sanuj	{
 sanuj	Any* a = tag_map[tag.getName()];
 sanuj	return a->as<T>();
 sanuj	}
 lisitsyn	hmm yeah
 lisitsyn	somehow it returned a wrapper for int*
 lisitsyn	not the value itself
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	why do we have T&
 sanuj	I tried T but gives error
 sanuj	with swig
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ok I get the problem
 lisitsyn	not that I know the reason though
 lisitsyn	sanuj: could you please check it in swig docs?
 lisitsyn	how to map primitive types and so on
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, T& is because of any
 sanuj	but i don't know why we have T& there
 lisitsyn	nah that's ok
 lisitsyn	why not?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: oh
 lisitsyn	whta happens if you try T then?
 sanuj	i had tried it earlier
 sanuj	c++ code works fine
 sanuj	if i remember correctly
 sanuj	let me try again

-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 sanuj	lisitsyn, yes cpp code works fine
 sanuj	lisitsyn, oh it's working with swig also
 lisitsyn	3 + 3
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	3 + obj.getInt(length_tag)
 sanuj	gives 13
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what to do now?
 lisitsyn	make it work with strings :)
 sanuj	i think it works with strings also
 sanuj	let me see
 sanuj	works
 sanuj	name_tag = TagString("name")
 sanuj	obj.setString(name_tag, "Jon Snow")
 sanuj	 obj.getString(name_tag) + " is alive!"
 sanuj	= 'Jon Snow is alive!'
 sanuj	:P
 Saurabh7	:D
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: hi
 sanuj	lisitsyn, this is how shogun.i looks for now
 sanuj	https://github.com/sanuj/shogun-plugin-arch/blob/master/tags-string/src/interfaces/shogun.i
 sanuj	wiking, still around?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no I mean
 lisitsyn	by strings
 lisitsyn	get("my super parameter").asInt()
 sanuj	ah
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how to make that work
 sanuj	oh wait
 lisitsyn	set(string, T)
 lisitsyn	get(string)
 lisitsyn	:)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do you want to keep get by tag?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes sure
 lisitsyn	both ways
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i'll do it after dinner :)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, till when are you around?
 lisitsyn	half an hour more then will disappear for 5 hours
 sanuj	you sleep for 5 hrs only? :D
 sanuj	see you tomorrow then
 lisitsyn	sanuj: nah that's lecture
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I teach some machine learning

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: Hey I was trying things with subsets and thread safety
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool!
@HeikoS	and?
 Saurabh7	To do that i thought of one way i put it in the doc
 Saurabh7	we would have to pass an identifier to the index_conversion method
 Saurabh7	because thats what is being used everywhere to access
 Saurabh7	but we dont have control when the index conversion happens in alogs
 Saurabh7	so I think we would have to update feature access methods , kernel compute things and labels for that
 Saurabh7	if to be done this way
