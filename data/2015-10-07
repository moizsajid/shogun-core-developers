 sreillly	Anyone around today? Having a problem installing shogun without sudo privileges.  cmake works great but upon running make I get this error: [ 73%] Linking CXX shared library libshogun.so
 sreillly	relocation  R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object;
 CaBa	that shouldn't be related to privileges
 CaBa	or are you talking about 'make install'?
 sreillly	yeah, i guess not more related to position independent code, just had a of privilege issues before
 sreillly	thanks for answering CaBA! this is just on make.
 CaBa	i have no idea what your error is about though :P
 sreillly	ah.
 sreillly	thanks though!
 sreillly	it has something to do with linking CXX shared libraries. thats about all i know
 sreillly	fixed it in case anyone cares for the future: rebuild zlib with CFLAGS="-fPIC"
