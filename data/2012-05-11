 n4nd0	blackburn: hey! how is it going?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey just finishing up my deals here at job
 blackburn	they should curse me for my autotest system haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha
 n4nd0	what have you done with it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: rather nothing I spent a lot of time doing shogun and watching youtube videos :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: :D I bet that it's not so bad since they want you back after summer
 n4nd0	;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have a doubt, maybe you can help me with it if you have a moment
 blackburn	I guess it costs less to have someone who gives a shit about that crazy ERP system
 blackburn	n4nd0: so how are you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: fine too
 n4nd0	blackburn: I didn't get the final grade yet but it turns out that I have passed the course I did the exam last Monday :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh cool
 n4nd0	it looks that it went actually quite good, they have just corrected half of it but I am already saved :D
 n4nd0	so I wanted to ask you before
 n4nd0	I have the following scenario
 n4nd0	CMachine <-- CSOMachine
 n4nd0	CMachine has labels so CSOMachine gets them as well as a member, that's ok
 n4nd0	the thing is that CMachine has this member declared as CLabels and I would to have it from CSOMachine downwards in the hierarchy as CStructuredLabels
 n4nd0	is there any way to make that change in CSOMachine so the classes that will inherit from it won't need to do the cast?
 n4nd0	I think it would be nice to do it just once in CSOMachine, the base class for SO, and forget about it in the rest other SO machines
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't think there is a way..
 n4nd0	:(
 wiking	n4nd0: well an easy solution is that you provide a private function in SOMachine for getting that variable
 wiking	and there you do a try { dynamic_cast ... return } catch {} stuff
 wiking	but there's even like a model pattern for this
 wiking	like a visitor pattern or such
 wiking	but then you'll have to rewrite some more stuff
 wiking	so i guess the simple private helper function would be more feasible
 wiking	and make it inline so it'll be really fast
 wiking	;)
 n4nd0	but I should make it protected right?
 n4nd0	so the children has access to it
 wiking	ah yeah
 n4nd0	I am getting some errors in preprocessor/PCA.cpp
 blackburn	n4nd0: ?
 n4nd0	and SGMatrix.h, SGVector.h
 n4nd0	wait
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ujahj1
 n4nd0	but I must go now
 n4nd0	maybe we can solve it later
 blackburn	huh

 n4nd0	gsomix: have you got a moment?
 n4nd0	I am getting some compile errors I am afraid they may be caused by the SGVector refactoring
 n4nd0	just in case you get a moment to check it

 wiking	this is for managing
 wiking	so for u to manage for example shogun pull requests
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	I should try that
 wiking	but i wonder if there's a way that i can do similar by sending pull requests
 blackburn	wiking: ok I had some uncertainity here

 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	only two here (I thought more)
 blackburn	schedule(dynamic) nowait

 blackburn	emrecelikten: which part of?
 emrecelikten	Well mainly St. Petersburg, the architecture is really interesting
 gsomix	sonney2k, I'm doing progress with CArray. I need a little more time.
 gsomix	good night
 n4nd0	gsomix: hey! did the error I posted before look familiar?
 blackburn	emrecelikten: yeah st.p is cool
 emrecelikten	blackburn: any other recommendations?
 gsomix	n4nd0, ah, nope. I don't involved in SGMatrix transition. but I can look at this tomorrow.

 blackburn	emrecelikten: however moscow is cool too
 n4nd0	gsomix: all right, I will take a look then

 emrecelikten	blackburn: Well we suffer from a derivative of the same kind of guy you know
 emrecelikten	blackburn: I don't think I will be able to visit Russia without learning some Russian first though
