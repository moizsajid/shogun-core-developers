@iglesiasg	hey gsomix_!
@iglesiasg	gsomix_, how are you doing?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think he must be sleeping by now
@sonney2k	it is like 2 or 3 am :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, aham, what is his timezone?
@iglesiasg	I thought it was somewhere in the US
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, smae like lisitsyn's
@iglesiasg	no idea what smae is :S
@sonney2k	same :P
@iglesiasg	aah hehe
@iglesiasg	I checked http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/SMAE and I was like what?!
@sonney2k	Sailor Moon Awards Engine of course
@sonney2k	man!
@iglesiasg	yeah that one was best
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ohh man I finally ordered this damn sportswatch
@iglesiasg	hehe good
@sonney2k	or maybe not
@sonney2k	now I will have to go by bike to job and do all kinds of sports
@iglesiasg	hehe
@iglesiasg	I did my personal record in a race last week btw!
@iglesiasg	5 km -- 20:30
@sonney2k	I don't run
@iglesiasg	run is for weaks :D
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no I am a lame duck on land
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw I think it might also be swig related
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could be he has an old swig version that causes issues in the generated wrapper code
@iglesiasg	it could be, he mentioned the error happened in the Python part

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: same like HeikoS
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: ah so you share the flight?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: ok then I'll go for that lufthansa flight that arrives 12:20
 lisitsyn	I'll wait you there and then we go
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: you will likely need 1 hour extra to enter the US
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes may be even more
 lisitsyn	so it is unclear who gonna wait
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: and you will not allowed to use a mobile phone
 sonne|work	even though they have wifi on the airport
 sonne|work	anyway we will somehow make it
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: well you know how I look like and I know how you look like
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: luckily
 lisitsyn	that's a plus
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: what's the deal with mobile phone?

 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: pong
 lisitsyn	oh 90 mins
 lisitsyn	good
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, mm let me remember what was it I wanted to ask
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg, lisitsyn: please have a look at the meeting draft I sent
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: haha :)
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, I don't think I do remember fuck
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: also, do you have an idea about this:
 HeikoS1	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10763604
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: haha :) dont worry
@iglesiasg	next time I will just write it in the chat
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: I like your notebook
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: do we have some algorithms that can take a distance metric?
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: because would be cool to see that in there
 HeikoS1	like you mention this knn one
 HeikoS1	can ours do that?
@iglesiasg	yeah sure
@iglesiasg	that's how I benchmark our LMNN
@iglesiasg	the flow is like this
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yes I know
@iglesiasg	data -> LMNN -> distance -> kNN -> classification
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: cool, so this would be nice to have in the toy example
 HeikoS1	then one can compare classic knn vs metric knn
@iglesiasg	roughly, kNN also gets the data of course
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, yeah sure, still to come :)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: any ideas about that?
@iglesiasg	Georg had a nice idea about plotting neighbours graphs
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: fixing
@iglesiasg	and compare the neighbours found by kNN with Euclidean and kNN with LMNN-distance
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: how?
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: sweet
 HeikoS1	this is exactly the stuff we need :D
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn :develop * c9aea34 / src/interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/c9aea344300ebee55feda78443c33228892a22ce
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Ignore sparsity structure in modular
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: do these things also work on manifolds?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: ^
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, let me show you a new version of the notebook
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: cool, do you think its safe to push now? or should I ask travis again?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, yeah, you can actually do dim red with LMNN
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: where do you want to push it to?
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: wow nice!
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: I updated my PR, lets see
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, at the end I explained a bit this idea http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6334214
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: ah got it - I think it should work now
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: will wait for https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/10793683
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, instead of interpreting LMNN's result as a distance measure, there is another interpretation of it as a linear transformation
@iglesiasg	so in the last plot what I am showing is how the data looks like after applying this transformation to the data
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: nice, reading
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: btw you can just import pylab
 HeikoS1	then you get numpy and matplotlib
@iglesiasg	I might change it
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: not really important, just wanted to mention it since its less typing :)
@iglesiasg	I am in this period of my life where I like to be implicit importing python modules :)
@iglesiasg	explicit sorry, no implicit

 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah loooks ok
 HeikoS1	alright
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: have you seen sonne|work had some troubles with cheap flight?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: ?
 HeikoS1	he told me he booked
 HeikoS1	939 euros or so
 HeikoS1	but from berlin
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well it was more expensive than expected?
 HeikoS1	yeah
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: saw that
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: well its a US flight, these are expensive
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, but do you have a limit in the money you can spend for the flight?
 HeikoS1	mine is quite cheap
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: IDK
 HeikoS1	600 euros
@iglesiasg	I am assuming you get money from Google to do it
 HeikoS1	yeah we should get it back
 HeikoS1	if not we have the gsoc money
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well with some limits I guess
@iglesiasg	aham
 lisitsyn	mine is out of the limit
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn deserves to come with us
 lisitsyn	I think
 lisitsyn	:)
@iglesiasg	sure
@iglesiasg	I think it is definitely a good way of using that money
 HeikoS1	really looking forward! :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: once I get visa I buy that lufthansa that arrives to sfo 12:20
 HeikoS1	ok
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: 6 sept right?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: and once they have all the penetration procedures done we meet
 lisitsyn	:D
 HeikoS1	fingers crossed!
 HeikoS1	haha deep penetration
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yes 6 sept
 HeikoS1	ok, doing some work now, see you in an hour

 HeikoS1	switched to python though
 HeikoS1	but still massively use it
 HeikoS1	unfortunately
 HeikoS1	lack of proper shogun support still bugs me
@iglesiasg	I use it too quite a bit
@iglesiasg	it is where I get stuff working fastest
@iglesiasg	but steadily my Python skills are improving

 HeikoS1	notebooks are great to prototype
 HeikoS1	using them a lot

 HeikoS1	van51: hi!
 van51	hello
@iglesiasg	ready! :)
 HeikoS1	ok then
 HeikoS1	Welcome to the last Shogun GSoC meeting before the "pencils down"
 HeikoS1	deadline, September 16.
 hushell	Hi~
 HeikoS1	We will have one more post GSoC meeting in between then and September
 HeikoS1	23, which is the evaluation deadline, to celebrate, and to give
 HeikoS1	details about the final evaluations (which are quite similar to
 HeikoS1	mid-term)
 HeikoS1	There are a little less than 4 weeks left. So everyone should be about
 HeikoS1	to finish the coding parts of their project.
 HeikoS1	The last 1-2 weeks are for documentation, polishing, reviewing (will soon explain), not for coding new stuff!
 HeikoS1	This means coding has to be done in 2-3 weeks. Please be aware of that
 HeikoS1	The topics for today are
 HeikoS1	1.) IPython notebooks.
 HeikoS1	2.) Examples/Web-demos
 HeikoS1	3.) Student Peer-reviewing of project documentation.
 HeikoS1	4) Project updates
 HeikoS1	Any other suggestions?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn1, iglesiasg, sonne|work ?
 HeikoS1	ok then
 HeikoS1	1.)  IPython notebooks.
 HeikoS1	Again on the purpose: The notebooks should be a documentation of your complete GSoC project.
 HeikoS1	So don't just do simple toy examples, but rather describe all classes that you implemented, when they are applicable, etc.
 HeikoS1	Give a high-level overview of the classes you implemented (you know this, but others don't)
 HeikoS1	Give an example for every method you implemented if possible. Include non-toy datasets.
 HeikoS1	Include many plots to make them look cool.
 HeikoS1	Give references to the papers that you implemented.
 HeikoS1	The notebooks will be included in the upcoming Shogun 3.0 release (on our website), so your projects will get a lot of attention.
 HeikoS1	Your notebooks will be the main starting point for people to try out your stuff, so make them as nice as possible.
 HeikoS1	pickle27 and iglesiasg already have started on this, others please join
@iglesiasg	(HeikoS1 nothing to add, sorry the delay)
-!- zeller_ [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS1	Some more inspiration: http://scikit-learn.org
@iglesiasg	zeller_, hi Georg! :)
 HeikoS1	please start rather earlier than later on this process, as it takes some time
 HeikoS1	On a technical side: Please submit the notebooks without result cells, as we will render them automagically
 pickle27	HeikoS1: how do we do that?
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg, pickle27 could you maybe post links to the current version of yours?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, question!
 HeikoS1	pickle27: you can remove all result cells in the editor
@iglesiasg	sure, there you go http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6334214
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: question
@iglesiasg	there is a couple of typos in the last part, I will fix them
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, so for the version we submit, we don't include the figures?
@iglesiasg	not sure if figures are included as result cells
 HeikoS1	pickle27: clear al
 HeikoS1	exactly, just do clear
 HeikoS1	cell->all output->clear
 HeikoS1	the graphics are stored in binary format and we do not want that in the git
 pickle27	http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/develop/doc/ipython-notebooks/ica/bss_jade.ipynb
@iglesiasg	oh nice, thanks for the clear shortcut
 HeikoS1	We have a mechanism that renders the current git version every night and uploads the result (with plots) to our website from where people can view them
 pickle27	HeikoS1: okay that makes sense, I was wondering about that
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: will sool provide a page on the website for that
@iglesiasg	yep, priority once GSoC period is over
 HeikoS1	sure
 HeikoS1	ok, again to emphasize: your whole projects with all its subtleties should be documented in one notebook
 HeikoS1	any other questions?
 HeikoS1	hushell, gsomix, van51 everything clear?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: ^ ?
 gsomix	HeikoS, yep
 van51	HeikoS1: so far yeah
 HeikoS1	cool!
 HeikoS1	2.) Next point: Examples/Web-demos
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: i've got one: many parts of my project are depends on last year project, should i document them?
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: focus on your gsoc project in the norebook, and when thats done, it would be cool if you get a bit into the regression too
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: ok
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: as you fixed tons of bugs in there, it only works cause of your gsoc project :)
 HeikoS1	ok then, examples/web-demos
 HeikoS1	As said before, the most common use cases of your methods should be illustrated in a c++ example and at least one modular interface (python)
 HeikoS1	so at least 1-3 examples
 HeikoS1	If you want to do more, we greatly appreciate that.
 HeikoS1	like pickle27, who did some static examples (and interfaces)
 HeikoS1	keep in mind for the modular interfaces, you need to define interface files, start with that soon
 HeikoS1	Now that was said before
 HeikoS1	As some of you may have noticed, we have a growing web-demo framework, written by foulwall.
 HeikoS1	foullwall could you share a link=?
 HeikoS1	Everyone, so if you want to, and have time, include and example of your method in there.
 HeikoS1	We think this is very cool for presenting Shogun. As for example for the NIPS workshop where we want to send things to
 HeikoS1	Talk to S?ren and foulwall on how to do this.
 HeikoS1	Note this is optional, but we would love to see more demos on the new projects
 HeikoS1	foulwall: link?
 foulwall	http://nn.7nn.de:8000/
 HeikoS1	foulwall, as you don't have to write a notebook, please write a good documentation on how to use the web-framework.
 HeikoS1	It should be easy for anyone to extend/add demos after reading it
 zeller_	the link doesn't seem to work for me...
 foulwall	Ok HeikoS1 ,
@iglesiasg	zeller_, yeah, sorry about that. You have to complete the url with one of the examples you get listed in the 404 page
@iglesiasg	zeller_, for instance, http://nn.7nn.de:8000/clustering/entrance
 HeikoS1	zeller_: try for example this one
 HeikoS1	http://nn.7nn.de:8000/classification/binary/entrance
 zeller_	ah alright thx
 foulwall	zeller_: sorry I didn't add a entrance page
 HeikoS1	foulwall: we plan to integrate this to our webpage at some point, s?ren will update you on that
 HeikoS1	if we had the new gsoc methods in the demos, that would be awesome
 foulwall	ok HeikoS1
@iglesiasg	foulwall, the demos look really fancy :)
 foulwall	haha iglesiasg
 HeikoS1	I like them a lot, too :)
 HeikoS1	Questions on that?
 HeikoS1	Ok then to something new this year's GSoC
 HeikoS1	3.) Student Peer-reviewing of project documentation.
 HeikoS1	We think it is a good idea that someone who is not familiar with your projects takes a look.
 HeikoS1	This is why we ask you to pair up and to review each others project a bit.
 HeikoS1	We hope to get some synergistic effects from this, thats what open-source is about after all :)
 HeikoS1	Note that we do not ask you to review code (although feel free to do so), but rather documentation and usability.
 HeikoS1	Such as
 lisitsyn1	oops guys sorry
 HeikoS1	-Class documentation
 HeikoS1	Are all methods documented with doxygen?
 HeikoS1	Are all classes properly documented in @brief?
 HeikoS1	How is the framework API used, what things can be combined?
 HeikoS1	-IPython notebooks
 HeikoS1	Try to understand things, and if not, tell each other what's not clear.
 HeikoS1	Suggest extensions
 HeikoS1	etc
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn1: hello there ;)
 lisitsyn1	hey
 HeikoS1	Again,  for the web-demo framework of foulwall, there is also documentation/usability to review.
 HeikoS1	Here is a random list of student pairs:
 HeikoS1	van51 - gsomix
 HeikoS1	hushell - lambday
 HeikoS1	pickle27 - votjakovr
 HeikoS1	iglesias - foulwall
 HeikoS1	Please get in touch, ask for lists of classes and the notebooks and start giving each other feedback
 gsomix	van51, hey, maaaan
 HeikoS1	haha ;)
 van51	gsomix: yo :)
 HeikoS1	It is also probably more fun sharing things than just to do everything on your own :)
@iglesiasg	foulwall, demos for me! :)
 hushell	I'll send an email to lambday :) seems he is not here
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: I tricked the random generator there since you will do the website stuff ;)
 HeikoS1	hushell: yes please do, he could not be here today
 foulwall	iglesiasg: demo for you:)
 HeikoS1	pickle27, votjakovr you are also fine with that?
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: sure :)
 pickle27	HeikoS1: yeah sounds good!
 HeikoS1	cool!
 pickle27	votjakovr: I'll send you mail later today
 HeikoS1	Everyone, try to start with that slowly and plan for some more intense reviewing the last 2 weeks of gsoc
 HeikoS1	Questions/Suggestions?
 votjakovr	pickle27: ok
 HeikoS1	Sweet, so the last point for today is Project updates
 Cheng	how about trying to get a user who is not a developer to check?
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Do you know if require() will be optimized out when compiling without debug stuff?
 HeikoS1	Cheng: thats a good idea
@iglesiasg	Cheng, I think that is a very good idea too
 HeikoS1	what would be the best way to do this.
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, first we can try in the mailing list if there are volunteers
 HeikoS1	Maybe every student sends a mail with a description of his project/notebook to the mailing list and asks?
@iglesiasg	otherwise, when we get a question in the mailing list, we say: to get an answer, please help us before reviewing ... :P
 HeikoS1	haha :P
@iglesiasg	just kidding
 HeikoS1	thoralf: you can probably do one or two ;)
 HeikoS1	thoralf: no reqiure stays in
@iglesiasg	we can also ask friends who are not using Shogun, I guess we all one from school people interested in machine learning
@iglesiasg	one -> know
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: good idea
 pickle27	iglesiasg: thats a good idea
 thoralf	HeikoS1: Okay, since you asked me to replace assert() by require(), this will introduce some performance penalties.
 HeikoS1	thoralf:  assert also stays in (I think at least), lets discuss later
 thoralf	HeikoS1: assert() usually depends on -DNDEBUG
 HeikoS1	Best thing would be to announce the finished notebooks somewhere and then people can have a look
 HeikoS1	students, please also push your mentors you review your notebooks
 HeikoS1	Cheng: thanks for the idea, we will think about it a bit more :)
 HeikoS1	ok lets press on
 HeikoS1	4.) Project updates.
 HeikoS1	Please every student/mentor (preferably mentor since they haven't talked at all) give a brief update on the project.
 HeikoS1	In particular, where in the schedule you are, and whether its feasible to finish your project within the next 2-3 weeks.
 HeikoS1	I dont know all the mentor nicknames, so using students
 HeikoS1	van51 want to start?
 van51	sure
 van51	So when I started I was supposed to implement two GSoC ideas from your page
 HeikoS1	other please prepare texts :)
 van51	namely the hashing trick and the random fourier features, along with random kitchen sinks and fast food
 van51	the first project (the hashing trick) is pretty much done
 van51	and also suppors quadratic features
 van51	what remains for that part are some modular examples, a web demo and the python notebook
 van51	from the second part I am atm implementing random fourier features
 HeikoS1	van51: how are the benchmarks going?
 van51	HeikoS1: pretty good so far
 van51	HeikoS1: will include all results in the notebook
 HeikoS1	van51: looking forward to see that!
 HeikoS1	van51: yeah mention the benchmarks in the notebook, then people can have a look
-!- Cheng [~Cheng@pa49-180-112-58.pa.nsw.optusnet.com.au] has quit [Quit: Yaaic - Yet another Android IRC client - http://www.yaaic.org]
 van51	I believe it is feasible to complete everything else in 2-3 weeks
 van51	but in case I see that it won't be good work
 van51	I will do as much as possible
-!- Cheng [~Cheng@pa49-180-112-58.pa.nsw.optusnet.com.au] has joined #shogun
 van51	and continue after GSoC the rest
 HeikoS1	van51: try to pick most important things and make them work nice,
 HeikoS1	thats better than having lots of things which dont work well
 van51	HeikoS1: yeah exactly :)
 HeikoS1	van51: and keep in mind, last 1-2 weeks is documenting ;)
 HeikoS1	van51: you are very welcome to stay after gsoc, everyone is in fact! but we will talk about this another time
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, sorry, I am not sure about one thing
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: ?
@iglesiasg	last 1-2 weeks or documenting period includes also time to finish the notebook?
@iglesiasg	or it should be already finished by then?
@iglesiasg	sorry if you already mentioned it, and I missed it
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: yes, notebook, class dox, maybe finishing/tuning examples
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: the point is: no more coding of algorithms or so
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, all right, got it. Thanks!
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: thanks for pointing that out!
 HeikoS1	ok next mentor/student pair
 HeikoS1	gsomix
 gsomix	Ok.
 HeikoS1	(and then  iglesias, pickle27, votjakovr, hushell, lambday, foulwall)
 gsomix	So I finished most of CSV and LibSVM readers.
 gsomix	Need to prepare PR with examples and to refactor old IO code.
 HeikoS1	gsomix: did you test them on some files? Already usable?
 gsomix	HeikoS, yep. Soere helps me with csv examples, now it tested on shogun's train data.
 gsomix	*Soeren
 gsomix	*it is tested
 HeikoS1	cool, looking forward to see the examples, in fact I will use them soon :)
 HeikoS1	gsomix: how is the project status apart from that?
 gsomix	Hm, I should add support of protobuf file format.
 gsomix	And MATLAB file format.
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :develop * f4368f0 / src/interfaces/modular/ (4 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/f4368f03772e3425f8ba239842e0dee4795e1bd7
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added log-det framework (partly) to modular interfaces
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :develop * 832dd29 / src/interfaces/modular/ (4 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/832dd2952282b187c4ab4d1d6fe6d842aa6d0a46
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #1496 from karlnapf/develop
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added log-det framework (partly) to modular interfaces
 HeikoS1	gsomix: will that work in the next weeks?
 HeikoS1	sorry for the merge, travis just went green
 gsomix	Yep. I hope I can implement it before "pencils down".
 gsomix	otherwise I will stay after GSoC with this issues.
 gsomix	I also plan improve parsing and make it more fast.
 HeikoS1	gsomix: ok, cool, also keep in mind that documenting them is very important, so a notebook with examples will be very helpful
 gsomix	OK
 HeikoS1	gsomix: same for you, please dont code until the last minute, rather pick things and make them waterproof
 HeikoS1	much more useful
 HeikoS1	gsomix: thanks! continue?
 az_de	ok, I will do this
 az_de	pickle27 implemented all planned ICA /AJD algorithms and is currently doing an extra implementation of FastICA for comparison.
 HeikoS1	az_de: go ahead !
 az_de	There are several examples and ipython notebooks on toy data, on cool audio data
 az_de	and an application to fetal ECG, where the goal is to separate the heart beat signals of the mother and the baby.
 HeikoS1	yep, I liked them :)
 az_de	All of those work essentially and just need some polishing and further documentation /testing...
 az_de	In summary, very good work!
 HeikoS1	az_de, pickle27 I havent seen the baby one yet, is it public?
 pickle27	az_de: thanks!
 pickle27	HeikoS1: I haven
 pickle27	't pushed it yet, Im still playing with it
 HeikoS1	pickle27: ok, looking forward to see this
 HeikoS1	pickle27: you added some static interfaces right?
 pickle27	HeikoS1: yes the ICA algs are available from the static interface
 pickle27	I haven't testes python static but it works in Octave and R
 HeikoS1	pickle27: maybe you can also assist others in doing some small bits, since its very cool to have things available in R and Matlab until we find a solution to modular
 HeikoS1	if someone wants to do static interfaces, pickle27 is your man :)
 pickle27	HeikoS1: yes certainly I can lend a hand
@iglesiasg	I would like to make LMNN accessible in static too, so I will come to you pickle27
 HeikoS1	az_de, pickle27 thanks! continue?
 HeikoS1	iglesiasg: next?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: sounds good
 zeller_	that'd be great
 zeller_	alright
 zeller_	Fernando's LMNN project is well on track: the main algorithm is in shogun, it seems to be correct (but a bit more testing on larger data sets will be done before the end of GSoC) and slightly faster than the reference implementation in Matlab (if time permits additional optimization could be done, I guess).
 zeller_	On top of that he has already implemented a variant that learns a diagonal metric transformation (in contrast to the full LMNN, it essentially only rescales feature coords, without rotation), and we will discuss another L1-regularized version of this later today, I hope it's feasible to include this too during the next weeks.
 HeikoS1	zeller_, iglesiasg you should add the speed tests to benchmarks/
 shogun-buildbot	build #1937 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1937  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 zeller_	wher would you add these?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS1, I think I have never seen these, I will check
 HeikoS1	zeller_, iglesiasg see van51 recent additions there
 HeikoS1	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1466#discussion_r6082618
@iglesiasg	yeah, I just found the dir
 zeller_	looks good
 HeikoS1	cool
@iglesiasg	didn't know about this, I will use it as reference
 HeikoS1	what about the real-data for the notebook?
@iglesiasg	van51, thank you for this!
 zeller_	I hope there's a bit of time left for comparing a few multiclass classifiers to LMNN
@iglesiasg	yes
 HeikoS1	zeller_: yes that would be cool
 van51	iglesiasg: hehe np
 zeller_	I'm working on compiling a few bioinformatics data sets maybe also for the notebook
@iglesiasg	regarding real data, so far I have used the wine data set and a portion of MNIST
 HeikoS1	ah thats nice
 HeikoS1	zeller_, iglesiasg finished?
 zeller_	yes
@iglesiasg	yes, I think that is pretty much it
 HeikoS1	ok then, votjakovr please go on
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: ok
 votjakovr	This GSoC i've finished Laplacian and EP binary GP classifiers.
 votjakovr	Also i added some numerical integration stuff (it probably can be used by some other parts of shogun).
 shogun-buildbot	build #1569 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1569  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 votjakovr	Also i've done many fixes and improvements of existing regression part of GP framework.
 votjakovr	Now i'm fixing gradient model selection, since it's very important for GP classification/regression.
 HeikoS1	If time permits, we also want to add multiclass GP methods (starting with Laplace approximation)
 HeikoS1	for the notebook, I am currently scanning a few bio classification datasets
 HeikoS1	romand has already written a raphical python example which will probably also be the basis of a notebook
 HeikoS1	Roman, sorry
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: yeah
 HeikoS1	and a possible extension is a variational multiclass GP classifier
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: but it seems like after GSoC
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: yep, I meant that :)
 HeikoS1	One problem was that last year's GP implementation was quite buggy and was refactored significantly
 HeikoS1	but now everything is tested and much more stable
 HeikoS1	ok, that's about it for us, hushell could you continue?
 hushell	okay
 hushell	Few words for reminder. My project is about large scale general strucured output models. So my work mainly focuses on structured prediction and online SOSVM solvers.
 hushell	I have done: 0) refine current SOSVM framework in Shogun. 1) Factor Graph framework. 2) MAP inference framework. 3) max product for tree graph. 4) learning stuffs of factor graph model (loss-augmented decoding etc.) This is the PR what I am working on.
 hushell	TODO list: 1) OCR demo (with ipython notebook) 2) stochastic subgradient descent SOSVM solver. 3) block coordinate Franke-Wolfe SOSVM solver
 hushell	I want to make the demo works first, then move on implementing more solvers. I am a bit lagging behind the schedule, but I think at least first 2 items in the TODO list will be finished on time. I'll make all the things left after GSOC.
 hushell	After GSOC: 1) refine SO learning code. 2) more MAP inference methods, such as graphcuts, TRW-S, LPR etc. 3) pictorial structure demo.
 HeikoS1	hushell: wow thats a lot :)
 hushell	HeikoS1: I got a lot of time to prepare :)
 HeikoS1	hushell: I agree with you, rather finish things with demos/tests before starting new stuff
 HeikoS1	hushell: for your stuff, examples will be quite important to understand whats going on as its not so common :)
 HeikoS1	then, finally, foulwall, please go ahead
 hushell	yes, I'll speed up myself to get the demo working
@iglesiasg	hushell, one question about the OCR demo
@iglesiasg	hushell, will you be using the FactorGraphModel for that? I have seen OCR before done with HMM, so I wondered if you planned to use factor graph or the hm-svm
 hushell	iglesiasg: I am going to use the tree max-product to do the inference
@iglesiasg	hushell, all right!
 hushell	and compare the results with different solvers, also with hm-svm
@iglesiasg	it sounds good
 lisitsyn1	is that enough time
 lisitsyn1	to finish things?
 hushell	Patrick suggests this is easier than other stuff, he has an OCR demo in his code as well
 lisitsyn1	alright
 HeikoS1	hushell: try not to leave things unfinished, if you feel that its going to be too much, drop it for gsoc
 HeikoS1	always can continue afterwards
-!- zeller_ is now known as georg_zeller
 HeikoS1	Everyone, please keep in mind to stop coding in 2-3 weeks
 HeikoS1	ok, foulwall please give us an update for your stuff
 foulwall	ok HeikoS1
 hushell	HeikoS1: Sure. I'll make a waterproof gsoc, rather than crappy one ;)
 foulwall	up to now , I almost finished the idea  'implementing interactive graphical demos'. Only arts/asp demos left, I can finish this week.
 sonne|work	foulwall: (and multiclass)
 foulwall	sonne|work: :) That's already merged, pr sent soon.
 foulwall	Now I'm working on simple mldata h5 downloader for shogun(debugging).
 foulwall	I'm happy to help you with the web-based examples in next weeks.(just give me ipynb and I'll merge)
 HeikoS1	foulwall, sonne|work would be great to have a tutorial how to extend the web things
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: foulwall already wrote a README
 pickle27	foulwall: I might be interesting in making a web demo
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: thats good, please include it in the peer-reviewing then, iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	ok
 pickle27	foulwall: I'll send you a mail later and we can discuss
 foulwall	Ok pickle27,
 foulwall	I believe it's feasible to complete the demos and downloader before pencil down
@iglesiasg	pickle27, CC the mailing list if you don't mind please :)
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: the GPs should def. also be in the web-demos
 sonne|work	foulwall: van51 will also need your help
 pickle27	iglesiasg: sure!
@iglesiasg	pickle27, I want to see how much effort that might take
 sonne|work	foulwall: so I guess will get some questions in the following weeks on IRC
 pickle27	iglesiasg: haha me too lol
 HeikoS1	votjakovr: there is already some basic stuff for gp regression, would be nice to have other cool things
 foulwall	ok:) I'll keep online
 HeikoS1	foulwall: thanks!
 HeikoS1	I'll close with a brief update for lambday as he could not make it
 foulwall	:) HeikoS1
 votjakovr	HeikoS1: ok, i'll add :)
 HeikoS1	He recently merged the final missing piece in his big framework
 HeikoS1	Now is the time for testing as these estimators suffer numerical problems sometimes
 HeikoS1	There is quite some stuff regarding linear solvers, eigen solvers, linear operators which will be accessible from shogun
 HeikoS1	A big example with a GMRF on worldwide ozone data is waiting to be tested, too
 HeikoS1	Since I do use these methods in research, I will also pass on this stuff to lambday
 HeikoS1	In addition, he wrote this IndependentComputation framework
 HeikoS1	Which is a general interface for parallel computation on multicore/cluster
 HeikoS1	I am currently running a PBS version of this and it works fine
 HeikoS1	So we might add that to Shogun after GSoC (hopefully)
 HeikoS1	That's it
 HeikoS1	Any remarks or final points?
 sonne|work	nice
 sonne|work	I have one remark if there is no further comment
 HeikoS1	please go ahead
 sonne|work	Please fix warnings also on the buildbots e.g. http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1654/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%2839%29
 sonne|work	you can see them all here http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
 sonne|work	lets try to get at least python modular down to 0 warnings
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: good point! I hope this will be massively reduced after the dox peer reviewing
 HeikoS1	To explain, if you find your class in these warnings, you forgot to document member variables, functions
 HeikoS1	Or you got a name clash with a modular language keyword
 sonne|work	etc
 HeikoS1	Students, BTW we will be releasing Shogun 3.0 shortly after gsoc, so if you want to help on that, let us know
 HeikoS1	see the issue list for milestone 3.0 on github
 HeikoS1	If there are not further remarks?
 lisitsyn1	are we sure we need 3.0?
 sonne|work	well please help with that
 sonne|work	the 3.0 release I mean
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn1: dont know, we should discuss if you dont agree I guess :) but many new features
 HeikoS1	The meeting is over! Thanks for attending, I will send a summary to the mailing list
 sonne|work	if you do all your work will be included and the next release will be massive
 lisitsyn1	okay I don't agree ;) I don't think it is 3.0
 sonne|work	and due to the demos / notebooks etc a lot of people will look at it
 sonne|work	and yes please stick with us if you had fun
 HeikoS1	yep, we will get quite some attention I guess :)
 sonne|work	we definitely need you in the team :)
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: we should have another "recruiting" meeting after gsoc and celebrate ;)
 sonne|work	Well I guess we can invite people who stay to the next shogun workshop in berlin or so :)
 sonne|work	but lets first finish gsoc successfully
 hushell	I will be happy to keep staying at Shogun :)
 sonne|work	everyone thanks for your excellent work
 sonne|work	we have come a long way this gsoc again
 sonne|work	alright I am done :)
 pickle27	yeah I plan on sticking around too! (although I'll be mia for a bit I'll be back in Dec!)
 sonne|work	hushell, pickle27 would be very nice
 HeikoS1	hushell, pickle27 would be very cool if you stayed!
 sonne|work	and of course van51, votjakovr, foulwall, gsomix you are most welcome too
 HeikoS1	sonne|work: and lambday :)
 HeikoS1	ok I am getting lunch :) see you

 hushell	okay, I go back to sleep, CU guys
 HeikoS1	hushell: bye!
 sonne|work	HeikoS1: yes sure (lambday)
 sonne|work	bye everyone and hushell, foulwall have a nice sleep
 gsomix	sonne|work, OK :)
 pickle27	sonne|work: I have another swig question for you - I've been playing with the Ruby modular stuff, how does swig determine which "in" typemap is used
 pickle27	sonne|work: like how would it decide between these two: TYPEMAP_SGMATRIX(float32_t, NUM2DBL, rb_float_new) and TYPEMAP_SGMATRIX(float64_t, NUM2DBL, rb_float_new)
 pickle27	is it decided based on the required shogun type?
 sonne|work	pickle27: there is a typecheck typemap to determine which one to use
-!- georg_zeller_ [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
-!- georg_zeller_ [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has quit [Client Quit]
 pickle27	sonne|work: and that works on the required shogun type?
-!- georg_zeller_ [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
-!- georg_zeller_ [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has quit [Client Quit]
 pickle27	like say I pass a numpy array of float32 to RealFeatures which uses float64 internally the typemap that gets called is for SGTYPE=float64_t right?
-!- georg_zeller [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 pickle27	so my typemap would need to grab float32 from the pyobj and cast them to float64 for the shogun stucture
 shogun-buildbot	build #1353 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1353  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 sonne|work	pickle27: no it works on the e.g. ruby objects and if an object fits  - which you signal by returning 1 - the respective in typemap is used
 sonne|work	pickle27: it cannot be done on an OUT typemap
 sonne|work	pickle27: for OUT you would need to write simply another function returning another datastructure to distinguish things
-!- van51 [~van51@ppp-94-66-14-37.home.otenet.gr] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 pickle27	sonne|work: okay I see that now but how does it decide which version of the typemap?
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-234-78-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has joined #shogun
 travis-ci	[travis-ci] it's Heiko Strathmann's turn to pay the next round of drinks for the massacre he caused in shogun-toolbox/shogun: http://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/10797725
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-234-78-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has left #shogun []
-!- lisitsyn1 [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has left #shogun []
 sonne|work	pickle27: based on the typecheck
 sonne|work	pickle27: you write one typecheck typemap per type to check
 sonne|work	and you return either 0 or 1
 sonne|work	IIRC you can also prioritize
 pickle27	sonne|work: The problem I am having is understanding the type of the Ruby NMatrix so that I can cast its data properly and iterate through it with pointer arithmetic (the NMatrix c api is pretty rough), I'll post a paste in 2 secs and explain the problem, Im trying to figure out if its an NMatrix api problem or a me not understanding swig well enough problem
 pickle27	http://pastebin.com/rrtp7PBp
 pickle27	so my typecheck happens in line 4
 pickle27	then in line 39 my NMatrix in map starts
 pickle27	DENSE_STORAGE->elements is a void* so I need to cast it
 pickle27	and my instincts tell me that I shouldn't need the switch case because that should be handled by which typemap is used
 pickle27	but if I cast s->elements with SGTYPE it doesn't work because the Ruby array is 32 and its being cast to 64

 thoralf	HeikoShi
 thoralf	HeikoS: Got 10 minutes?
 thoralf	sonney2k: You too?
 pickle27	HeikoS: btw not sure why that test fails let me know if it continues to do so
 thoralf	HeikoS, sonney2k: I just added some handy sanity checks to several places in the code using "REQUIRE()".
 thoralf	But it really slows down shogun, since it's not removed compiling with debug options.
 thoralf	(Like assert when setting NDEBUG)
 thoralf	I'd like to keep these checks, but it should be possible to disable them.  Otherwise shogun is not fun any more. ;)
 thoralf	But using the checks, developing gets more fun.
 thoralf	Do you have any ideas?
 thoralf	Something like "SANITY", which gets disabled when NDEBUG is set.
 thoralf	Since it's no real error handling but more a kind of parachute when developing. :)
@HeikoS	Sorry thoralf I am in a car...
@HeikoS	But I like the idea
 thoralf	If I introduce "SANITY" which is the same as REQUIRE, but can be disabled, would that be okay?
 thoralf	Or shall we discuss that further?

 thoralf	Hey S?ren.
 gsomix	http://isocpp.org/files/papers/n3744.pdf
@HeikoS	Though one critique is that this should not be necessary.  If you cannot be sure what your code does you did something wrong.... and otherwise you assert or require. But require is mainly used to check wrong user input
 thoralf	HeikoS: Just think of (implicit) bounds checking when using vec[i] (vec is of type SGVector).
 thoralf	HeikoS: I did this and it breaks some unit-tests. ;)

@sonney2k	thoralf, ASSERT is the same as REQUIRE in shogun
@sonney2k	thoralf, we don't remove ASSERTS with -NDEBUG
@sonney2k	thoralf, the way I usually do this when developing is to define some macro DEBUG_XXX which disables the debug output/assertions completely later on when defined empty

 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: well depends where we stay
