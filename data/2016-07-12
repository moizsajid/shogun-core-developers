 OXPHOS	wiking: hey are you familiar with cereal? I am having some trouble splitting serializing function into .h and .cpp
 OXPHOS	wiking: i have an example here: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/03d20339c3cf36a7a5cc11e3ab3fd7fe
 OXPHOS	wiking: things work when save/load pair implementations are in header files
@wiking	you have bigger problems
@wiking	  "base::base()", referenced from:
@wiking	derived::derived() in test-68d624.o
@wiking	the Makefile is wrong
@wiking	you need base.o there
@wiking	see what i mena?
@wiking	*mmean?
@wiking	i reckon once you have that fixed
@wiking	your undefined references should go away
 OXPHOS	wiking: thx! so i did: g++ -c -std=c++11 *.cpp
 OXPHOS	and g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp
 OXPHOS	I still got symbol error (and i got similar error in shogun::CSGObject
 OXPHOS	wiking: i updated the gist: https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/03d20339c3cf36a7a5cc11e3ab3fd7fe
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	this *cpp
@wiking	is a bit bs
@wiking	:)
@wiking	so
@wiking	g++ -c -std=c++11 base.cpp
@wiking	g++ -c -std=c++11 test.cpp
@wiking	g++ -std=c++11 base.o test.o -o test

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added multikernel sample_null
 OXPHOS	wiking: thanks! the same error though..
@wiking	mmm what?
 OXPHOS	wiking: undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 blabla. in https://gist.github.com/OXPHOS/03d20339c3cf36a7a5cc11e3ab3fd7fe
@wiking	heey yeah
@wiking	you'll have to either instanciate all the types of Archive variable in cpp
@wiking	or do the implementation in the .h
@wiking	OXPHOS: ^
@wiking	see what i mena

 OXPHOS	wiking: ahhhh u'r right!
@wiking	because you actuall do not have the generated code for the template<class Archive>
@wiking	void base::save(Archive & archive) const
@wiking	especially not the instantion of that using cereal::JSONOutputArchive
@wiking	so either you let the compiler know how to generate that code
@wiking	i.e. add the implementaiton of those templated functions into the header
@wiking	or you actually do the specialization of the template fucntion for all the Archive types
 OXPHOS	does it look good to do the specialization of cereal stuff in SGObject.cpp..?
 OXPHOS	i did it in .cpp because
 OXPHOS	i want to use the map/tag system in sgobject
 OXPHOS	but it's in a pimpl
 OXPHOS	only defined in .cpp
 OXPHOS	though i didn't see why it had to be like that bzdmgz^
 OXPHOS	wiking^
 bzdmgz	why should it be in header?
 OXPHOS	bzdmgz: i need to iterate through self.map in serialization function in SGObject.h (ideally)
 bzdmgz	why in h?
 bzdmgz	it sounds slow to compile
 OXPHOS	bzdmgz: or i'll have to do the specialization of cereal file type in SGObject.cpp, which looks bad..but no real harm i guess
 bzdmgz	I think you also would need to patch the 'Any' class
 bzdmgz	you don't know type outside of this 'any' object
 OXPHOS	bzdmgz: really...lemme try
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	i mean the problem of having the specialization within .cpp
@wiking	is that you will only support a given set of Archives
@wiking	and if you wanna add your own implemenations
@wiking	that'll be foobar
@wiking	right?
 OXPHOS	wiking: yes..
@wiking	so ooooooooo
@wiking	baaaaaaaaaazdmeg
