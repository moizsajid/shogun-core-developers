 CaBa	wiking: ping
 CaBa	is there any example on how to do model selection in case of MKL?
@wiking	CaBa, hey
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	have you checked the notebooks?
@wiking	c4goldsw, hi man
@wiking	sorry we've been busy with the release
@wiking	and gsoc summit
@wiking	but i'm gonna get to your PR asap
 CaBa	just staring at this right now: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/kernel/CombinedKernel.cpp#L805

 CaBa	wiking: where can i search the notebooks?
-!- ajatgd [8ba74f02@gateway/web/freenode/ip.139.167.79.2] has quit [Client Quit]
 CaBa	wiking: i don't really get how i can add the kernels with their own parameters to be learned

 CaBa	hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	CaBa: hihi
@HeikoS	all good?
 CaBa	HeikoS: trying to figure aout MKL + MS
 CaBa	HeikoS: no examples out there, are they?
@HeikoS	I am not sure
@HeikoS	but what do you want to model select?
@HeikoS	only thing you need is the regularisation parameter, no?
 CaBa	HeikoS: the parameters of the individual kernesls
@HeikoS	the MKL learns the kernel weights for you
@HeikoS	the coefficients
 CaBa	HeikoS: yes but how about the parameters of the used kernels?
@HeikoS	usually, one would put in multiple kernels with different parameters
@HeikoS	but yeah you should also be able to model select them
@HeikoS	just do the usual story of building a parameter tree
@HeikoS	it is a bit insane computationally though ;)
@HeikoS	there is the ipython notebook on model selection
 CaBa	is there mkl in there?
@HeikoS	you can open manually, but we are in fact preparing a new release atm and it will be on the website soon
@HeikoS	as in today/tomorrow
@HeikoS	no mkl in there
 CaBa	well MS i've alreay been doing
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	doesnt it work with mkl?
@HeikoS	I can have a look
@HeikoS	(after we released)
 CaBa	i don't see how i could add that, maybe i don't get the idea
@HeikoS	you build the parameter tree
@HeikoS	put in all the things you want
@HeikoS	and then as usual
@HeikoS	mkl might or might not work with that
@HeikoS	but it is easy to make it work if it doesnt and I can help
@HeikoS	but building the parameter tree should be straight forward
 CaBa	it isn't to me right now
 CaBa	that's my problem
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	I can write something
@HeikoS	tomorrow ok?
@HeikoS	I might do it in the plane
 CaBa	any brief example on how to plug this together would be great
@HeikoS	have a 10 hr flight later
 CaBa	yeah thanks
@HeikoS	cool will do
@HeikoS	CaBa: ping me if you dont hear anything
 CaBa	will do
 CaBa	;)
 CaBa	have a safe trip
@HeikoS	thanks :)
@HeikoS	CaBa: hey do you want to contribute a cookbook page for modelselection?
@HeikoS	CaBa: in the style of this: http://shogun.ml/cookbook/latest/
 CaBa	HeikoS: sure, if i get to figure it out :))
 CaBa	HeikoS: is running multiple kernels on the same data the usual usecase for MKL?
 CaBa	HeikoS: because that's not what I'm doing... every kernel works on it's own data in my case
@HeikoS	yeah it is fine
@HeikoS	but depends on what you want to do
@HeikoS	we have a noteobok on mkl, you saw that?
 CaBa	yep, just went through that
 CaBa	the old school examples are a bit more exhaustive here i think ;)
 lisitsyn	hey guys
 CaBa	hey lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you back?
 lisitsyn	thanks for the plan
 lisitsyn	glanced over it
 CaBa	bbl, going home
@wiking	lisitsyn,
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
@wiking	when are you coming back to shogun? :D
 lisitsyn	is it an invitation?
 lisitsyn	:P
 lisitsyn	I guess nips
 lisitsyn	nips anybody?
@wiking	:(
@wiking	not this year again :(
 lisitsyn	meh
 lisitsyn	your employer
 lisitsyn	:P
@wiking	:D
@wiking	so btw
@wiking	do you have somewhere that SG_ADD patch
@wiking	that is not yet 100%
@wiking	but still something
 lisitsyn	uhmm yes
 lisitsyn	want to finish it?
@wiking	yeah woudl be good to have it out there
@wiking	so either we finish it
@wiking	or somebody
 lisitsyn	it is terrible
 lisitsyn	I mean I got into it
 lisitsyn	and then I realize I'm in freaking narnia
@wiking	;D
 lisitsyn	all is fragile and
 lisitsyn	no idea how to unfuck it
@wiking	heheh no worries
@wiking	we'll see
@wiking	just have it somewhere public
@wiking	so we can play with it
 lisitsyn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/b7823b95315068cda6fba24b41e11f46887064fd
 lisitsyn	this branch
@wiking	\o/
 lisitsyn	wiking: you will get the basic idea
 lisitsyn	I cna describe what is fucked
 lisitsyn	the thing is I had to patch any
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 lisitsyn	to support policy different from default
 lisitsyn	default policy is like copy like a pro
 c4goldsw	wiking Hey there
 lisitsyn	so it's owning
 c4goldsw	It's fine, no rush.
 lisitsyn	and I tried to add non-owning policy
 c4goldsw	Hey HeikoS
 lisitsyn	but here comes maths
 lisitsyn	you have owning x owning
 lisitsyn	owning x non-owning
 lisitsyn	etc
 lisitsyn	and I am not even sure I covered everything
@HeikoS	CaBa: well yeah, the idea is to port them all :)
 lisitsyn	it's quite tough
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: hi there
 lisitsyn	then as a desperate attempt I tried to add equals
@wiking	lisitsyn, ah i see ... let's see i mean this is definitely like 6.0.0 so we hav etime to figure out shit
 lisitsyn	ok
@wiking	we are gonna just fix notebooks
@wiking	now
@wiking	and some builds
@wiking	and then release whatever is now in develop
@wiking	to test the new release pipeline + website
 lisitsyn	so tldr: it is conceptually fucked so I had to take time to think
 lisitsyn	this means I context switched for an year
 lisitsyn	lol
@wiking	sure, we still have time
@wiking	till 6.0
 lisitsyn	my context switching is like
 lisitsyn	year by year
 lisitsyn	are you in the us still?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	next to heiko
@wiking	trying to fix the last shit
 lisitsyn	slap him
@wiking	to be able to release today
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what????

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what? ;)
@wiking	anyhow let's see how the release pipeline works out
@wiking	 :)))
@wiking	lisitsyn, have you seen that the buildbot is actually autodeploy the new website
@wiking	?: )
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh you rock
@wiking	when you push to shogun-web2 ? :D
@wiking	we have now in buildbot like all sorts of automation like this
@wiking	not only libshogun builds
 lisitsyn	oh this is good
@wiking	and basically thus
@wiking	we have a full release pipeline
@wiking	that creates all the artifacts
@wiking	that is needed for a release
@wiking	once you push/merge thing into master
@wiking	:D
@wiking	but have never tested it yet
@wiking	so lets see how it works out
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	production based testing
 lisitsyn	okie
 lisitsyn	:P
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	well fuck it
@wiking	we just need to do it once
@wiking	and then it should be fine
@wiking	and then we can do more frequently releases
@wiking	https://hub.docker.com/r/shogun/shogun/
@wiking	this is a libshogun nightly docker image :)
@wiking	based on trusty
