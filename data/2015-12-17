@besser82	HeikoS, lisitsyn:  Any idea, why some unit-tests are segfaulting, now?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no
@HeikoS	besser82: no idea
@besser82	sh*t...  :/
@HeikoS	besser82: any idea since when this is happening?
@HeikoS	probably some reverted patch around CSGObject
@besser82	HeikoS, segfaults are since last two weeks...
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^
@HeikoS	besser82: which patch?
@HeikoS	the buildbot should tell
@besser82	I hope so...
@besser82	lemme check the waterfall
@besser82	HeikoS, ha!  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/c6f9d2f2df14b0014a175212254ad293bb13fcdd
@HeikoS	besser82: ah crap
@HeikoS	besser82: let me guess
@HeikoS	serialisation tests?
@besser82	HeikoS, you got many points  ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: Ok I will try to fix that
* besser82 is crossing fingers
@besser82	HeikoS, and every test using serializaton fails, too, because of that
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah I guess I get why
@besser82	HeikoS, I'm doing a local build, so I can trace that, just in case...
@besser82	HeikoS, [ RUN      ] Serialization.multiclass_labels
@HeikoS	yep I thought so
@HeikoS	migration
@besser82	HeikoS, Speicherzugriffsfehler (Speicherabzug geschrieben)
@HeikoS	check the patch
@HeikoS	I think need to update old serialised files
@besser82	lemme try...  Is a new PR open?
@besser82	HeikoS, which Patch?  Where can I find?
@HeikoS	the one you sent eariler
@besser82	ahh... ok... the code from pr
@besser82	so multiclass_labels segfaults here:  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/base/Serialization_unittest.cc#L56
@besser82	HeikoS, ^
@besser82	because of 0-ptr in ASSERT
@HeikoS	besser82: thanks, will check in a bit
@besser82	HeikoS, looks like Ascii serialization is messed up...  :/
@HeikoS	besser82:  its not acsii
@HeikoS	its all
@HeikoS	;)
@HeikoS	I broek them
@besser82	The others work
@besser82	like JSON or HDF5
@besser82	HeikoS, are you fine with me reverting the migration-thing?
@besser82	looks like load_serializable() heavily depends on that...  :S
