 n4nd0	sonne|work: hi! I am thinking of applying for the project "various usability improvements" apart from SO to raise the possibilities of success a bit
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I have not previous coding experience with swig though, do you think that should prevent me from applying for that project then?

 harshit_	hello everyone
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 n4nd0	hi
 harshit_	@n4nd0 are you in the team of shogun ?
 n4nd0	harshit_: I have made some contributions to the code, but I am just an student
 harshit_	okay, Just had a few questions related to shogun's framework can you help me out
 n4nd0	of course, as long as I have the answers :P
 harshit_	if i want to do some operations on labels can i use CMath functions on it ?
-!- GenX [~Sambhav@14.139.82.6] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 n4nd0	harshit_: so CLabels have a member that is a SGVector called labels
 harshit_	operations as in scalar multiplication, or dot multiplication with any other vector
 n4nd0	exactly
 n4nd0	probably you can use that member to do the operations
 harshit_	that class : SGVector contains all the functions for these opns within it ?
 n4nd0	that class contains some functions but is not very exhaustive
 harshit_	wait i'll hav a look at its signature
 n4nd0	however, it has a public member
 n4nd0	T * where T is likely to be int32_t or float64_t
 n4nd0	so you can use CMath operations on that member
 harshit_	okay thanks bro.
 harshit_	and also i sent a mail on shogun's mailing list, But didnt get any reply
 harshit_	if you knw some thing related to those questions
 harshit_	please help me out, I am currently stuck in middle
 n4nd0	I read your mail yesterday
 n4nd0	but I couldn't answer most of the stuff
 n4nd0	let me read again and refresh, maybe we can discuss about it anyway
 n4nd0	so what does matlab minres exactly do?
 harshit_	Thanks, In advance
 harshit_	it calculates minimum resolution of a matrix
 harshit_	 i also dont knw much abt it, Maybe
 harshit_	some linear algebra guy will have more knowledge abt it
 n4nd0	I don't know what is the minimum resolution of a matrix :P
 harshit_	and second question: hav you come across any function in shogun for issparse()
 n4nd0	so for the issparse thing
 n4nd0	I know that in shogun there are structures prepared to hold dense data like CDotFeatures
 n4nd0	and sparse, CSparseFeatures
 n4nd0	so what is exactly the use that they make in the code of issparse?
 n4nd0	is it just to test if the structure is itself sth sparse?
 n4nd0	or do they actually check the content of the matrix to check whether it should be store as sparse?
 n4nd0	stored*
 harshit_	it checks the matrix if it is sparse or dense
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	but do you know how they make this check?
 harshit_	exactly, Same was my reaction when i came across this function
 harshit_	i can only say one thing MATLAB is gr8, it provides so complex thing in so much easy form
 n4nd0	take a look here
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ugxc2
 n4nd0	is from the matlab doc
 n4nd0	that makes me believe that they just check the type of container
 n4nd0	let me see if I get to the actual code
 harshit_	thats weird ..no ?
 n4nd0	why do you think so?
 harshit_	how can they decide whether it is sparse or not on basis of class being used ?
 n4nd0	I think matlab can store matrices in two (at least) different ways
 n4nd0	dense representation and sparse
 n4nd0	if you don't know what I mean, do like this in matlab
 n4nd0	A = [1 2; 3 4]
 n4nd0	sparse(A)
 n4nd0	you'll notice the different representation
 n4nd0	so I guess that internally they have something to check if the matrix is stored in one or the other way
 harshit_	yeah
 n4nd0	probably that issparse is just checking the value of that "something"
 harshit_	what value ?
 harshit_	i didnt get that last point
 harshit_	i think they must have some algo
 n4nd0	the value of the type of object
 harshit_	to check whether to store the matrix in sparse or dense format
 n4nd0	not whether TO store but whether IT is stored in sparse or dense
 n4nd0	but again, I'm not sure about this
 n4nd0	is just how I understand it from the doc of the file I pasted before
 harshit_	but we dont make any explicit call to store our matrices in dense or sparse format while creating it !
 n4nd0	what do you mean with our? in shogun?
 harshit_	no in matlab . when we create any matrix
 n4nd0	well
 n4nd0	if you just define it like A = [....]
 n4nd0	it will be dense
 n4nd0	if you do sparse(A)
 n4nd0	the return value is sparse
 n4nd0	check it with
 n4nd0	issparse(A) ( returns 0 )
 n4nd0	issparse( sparse(A) ) ( returns 1 )
 harshit_	yeah i saw that
 harshit_	, you made a good point with it
 n4nd0	:)
 harshit_	thanks i'll explore more about it
 n4nd0	I'm not sure about it though, so check it always just in case
 harshit_	yeah i know.. :)
 n4nd0	in order to translate this to shogun I'd say that
 n4nd0	if you deal with CFeatures in your function
 n4nd0	you should check if it is CDotFeatures or CSparseFeatures
 n4nd0	I am checking minres now
 n4nd0	it is for the minimum residual, I have heard that before at least :)
 harshit_	I think that wont be right .. but i'll hav a look on it
 harshit_	oh yeah, i wrote it wrong last time
 n4nd0	probably there is a method in blas for the minimum residual
 harshit_	but also min res is of special type ..
 n4nd0	??
 harshit_	its Hessian
 harshit_	i dont knw what it is
 harshit_	but it is given in the comment with minres() in .m file
 n4nd0	the second derivative of a matrix, like the Jacobian but one order more
 n4nd0	mmmmm
 n4nd0	but I guess that if the function in matlab computes the minimum residual
 n4nd0	a function that does the same should work
 harshit_	is that Hessian you are talkin about
 n4nd0	yes
 harshit_	yeah i'll have a look at clbas function list
 harshit_	i could not find minres in cblas .
 harshit_	checked all level 1,2,3
 harshit_	btw why are cblas functions divided into level 1,2,3
 harshit_	do you hav any idea ?
 n4nd0	opeartions between vectors, vectors and matrices and matrices; that's for the levels
 harshit_	okay, so what i am looking for should be in level 3
 harshit_	but there is nothing like that
 harshit_	are you there /
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	but I don't know how to compute that either so I am trying to find sth on the web
 harshit_	okay , thanks for your time
 n4nd0	for me it looks like this function you do the job
 n4nd0	http://www.netlib.org/templates/double/GMRES.f
 n4nd0	it's a LAPACK funtion so I'd say it can be used from shogun
 harshit_	i dont think whole lapack is included in shogun
 harshit_	is it?
 harshit_	coz last time i searched shogun's CMath library i didn't find any thing like this
 n4nd0	things in CMath are things that are implemented in shogun
 n4nd0	but shogun uses external libraries and packages
 n4nd0	so I think you can use that functions from shogun including the appropriate header
 harshit_	and while linking do i need to include appropriate library file and library path too ?
 harshit_	or every thing is in -lshogun itself
 n4nd0	what do you normally do to compile?
 n4nd0	I just run make and I think that with that it should be enough
 harshit_	okay i'll have a look at shogun's Makefile, That will probably tell me what all external libraries are included
 n4nd0	ok
 harshit_	damm shogun's makefile is really huge i havnt dealt with any thing like that before
 harshit_	and the function that you just told me gmres.f
 harshit_	it is written in fortran
 harshit_	how can i use it in C++
 n4nd0	in lapack.cpp you can see how other lapack functions are used from shogun
 harshit_	okay ,thanks.
 harshit_	got it, Thanks for your help
 n4nd0	no problem
 n4nd0	have to go now
 n4nd0	byew

@sonney2k	PhilTillet, any progress on opencl'ing linear combinations of kernels?
 PhilTillet	hello sonney2k
 PhilTillet	yes :)
 PhilTillet	I have implemented the formula with a gaussian kernel and random samples
 PhilTillet	but I don't really know where to start to integrate it
@sonney2k	well did you benchmark it?
@sonney2k	I mean that is what is most interesting for now or?
 PhilTillet	yes :) I wanted to benchmark it but needed a dataset
 shogun-buildbot	build #185 of nightly_none is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/185
@sonney2k	well random data again
@sonney2k	random alphas...
 PhilTillet	is it normal to get k(x,xi) = 0 for random data of very high values?
 PhilTillet	(between 0 and 1)
@sonney2k	gaussian kernel is between 0 and 1
 PhilTillet	i think it is because the norm of the difference becomes infinity
@sonney2k	1 on diagonal
 PhilTillet	but the opencl computation is not optimized at all for now, just wanted to make it work
 PhilTillet	i'll benchmark it right away
 PhilTillet	(for now it is really really really not optimized though)
 PhilTillet	well
 PhilTillet	one second for 1000*10000 data matrix
 PhilTillet	but it is really not optimized
 shogun-buildbot	build #184 of nightly_all is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_all/builds/184
 gsomix	sonney2k, hi
@sonney2k	hi gsomix
 gsomix	it seems that python_static works
@sonney2k	gsomix, nice
@sonney2k	did you need to do lots of fixes for that?
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, do you think I should try to optimize my OpenCL code or try to somewhat integrate it ? :)
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, how many alphas did you have in your setup?
@sonney2k	1000?
 PhilTillet	10000
@sonney2k	and 1000 test examples of which dimensionality?
 PhilTillet	I think I am confused
@sonney2k	you should compare this to the non opencl variant
@sonney2k	when you do k(x, x_i)
@sonney2k	what is the dimension of x?
 PhilTillet	1000
@sonney2k	and how many examples did you test this with? 1 then?
 PhilTillet	Okay I think there is some point I didn't understand
 PhilTillet	in the formula here
 PhilTillet	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CKernelMachine.html
 PhilTillet	I have : N = 10 000 and x.size() = 1 000
@sonney2k	(have to leave train soon)
 PhilTillet	and computed one f(x)
@sonney2k	yeah that is evaluated for 1 example
@sonney2k	but that is not what you want to optimize for
@sonney2k	you should assume that this will be evaluated for thousands of x
 PhilTillet	oh okay
@sonney2k	so the overhead of transfering alpha / x_i into GPU mem pays off
 PhilTillet	well, the transfer is at 16 GB/s , so it is more or less instant :p
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 PhilTillet	I think I get it
 PhilTillet	There is a big matrix A, and f is computed for each column of A, using the other columns as x_i
 PhilTillet	right?
 PhilTillet	(I should watch again my courses on SVM :p)
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, otherwise you cannot hope to be faster at all because all there is is reading over x_i / alpha_i x once

 PhilTillet	ah wait, I said 1 sec but i made a huge mistake benchmarking
 gsomix	sonney2k, no, not much
 gsomix	i learned how to do git branches (tnx blackburn).
 harshit_	hello sonney2k, can you please help me on minimum residual function . i found one in lapack (GMRES.f), but it is not in the lapack library in <shogun/mathematics/lapack.h>
 gsomix	i can try to make small commits now, instead of one large :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, very good :)

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi there! I am sorry to insist on the same but do you think it could be possible to apply to "various usability impromevents" even if I have not experience with swig?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, well you should attempt to show that you can deal with swig then
 n4nd0	sonney2k: my first option is SO but I think it might be better if I apply to another project as well, just to get better odds
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do you know of anyone else applying for SO?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have not heard of anyone, neither here nor in the mailing list
@sonney2k	n4nd0, regarding how to show - write some small typemap - e.g. the one missing in octave modular...
@sonney2k	...have to leave train.
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, see you later

 n4nd0	harshit_: hey!
 n4nd0	harshit_: I read your question, have you in any case tried to use it?
 harshit_	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	harshit_: I think it is not necessary for it to be defined in shogun/mathematics/lapack.h, you may use the function from the lapack library
 harshit_	but lapack library is in fortran, how can i use it in c++
 n4nd0	harshit_: one thing is the language the code is written and another the library
 n4nd0	harshit_: our C++ code in shogun is used from python, java, matlab, octave etc using swig for example
 harshit_	okay, havnt done that before
 n4nd0	harshit_: if you look at lapack.cpp
 n4nd0	harshit_: that's C++ code, but is it calling the functions from lapack
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	so in that sense i can add new
 harshit_	functions in lapack.cpp
 n4nd0	in any case, I am not completely sure about this
 harshit_	and then use it in my program
 n4nd0	I recommend you to try
 n4nd0	yes, you could do that
 harshit_	i'll try that
 harshit_	btw which project are you going for in gsoc
 n4nd0	SO
 n4nd0	structured output
-!- akarshanSK [~akarshan@202.3.77.217] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	you?
 harshit_	newtonSVM and integration of new versions of liblinear
 harshit_	also i was thinking to give another proposal for C5.0
 harshit_	decision trees
 n4nd0	ok
 harshit_	is that possible, To give 2 proposals to same organization
 n4nd0	the deep learning stuff didn't succeed finally?
 n4nd0	yes, no problem with that
 n4nd0	the only limitation is 20 proposals
 n4nd0	you can distribute them as you wish
 harshit_	nah, didn't get any update on that
 harshit_	also there are not much libraries for deep learning
 harshit_	that can be integrated into shogun
 harshit_	Any other organization you applying for ?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	you?

-!- romi_ [~mizobe@187.57.1.50] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars('SO') for python3 gives a result different from python2
 Miggy	sonney2k:i am interested in working on the project of implementing decision trees...so how should i proceed with it?
 gsomix	sonney2k, see ". / configure" on line 4302. the results are "?python-32mu.so" for python3 and ".so" for python2
 CIA-64	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r2002a08 / src/interfaces/modular/Library.i : Late fix for java serialization dummies - http://git.io/KUjQSw
 blackburn	shogun-buildbot: work!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
 PhilTillet	lol
 Miggy	blackburn: which project are u choosing this time? :P
@sonney2k	gsomix, maybe you can workaround this by doing distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars('SO')[0].rsplit('.')[-1]
 blackburn	Miggy: I want to work on domain adaptation and MT learning
 Miggy	cool
 blackburn	Miggy: you are asking in a way that makes me think you know who I am and what is I was working on before ;)
 Miggy	yes i know u worked on dimensionality reduction before :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, may be necessary to use distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars('BLDLIBRARY')? it returns "-L. -lpython3.2"
@sonney2k	gsomix, -L. is not what we want though
 Miggy	sonney2k: waiting for ur reply
 blackburn	Miggy: while Soeren is in ignore mode I would suggest you to contribute with something small
 blackburn	:D
 Miggy	hehe :)
 Miggy	related to decision tress or in general?
 blackburn	it is mainly up to you
 blackburn	decision trees in C++ can take a while
 Miggy	yes
@sonney2k	gsomix, look http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1749 - scipy people had the same problem
 blackburn	Miggy: were you applying last year?
 Miggy	yes
 blackburn	aha I see
 Miggy	only 5 slots :(
 blackburn	yeah it was tight
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, I made a mistake on my benchmark, the result was 1ms and not 1second :p
 Miggy	this time expecting more?
 blackburn	this year we expect a little more
 Miggy	great
 blackburn	no reason to really expect more although :D but makes sense cause we finished with glance
 gsomix	sonney2k, tnx
 blackburn	shogun-buildbot: !help
 blackburn	:D
 Miggy	the main problem is with the priority of the projects...some project u like to work on does not get selected :(
 blackburn	Miggy: I hope most interesting projects would be covered this year
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, what would be really interesting is to see a comparison to CPU version and for multiple x ...
 blackburn	what can I say is some file formats idea/mloss idea/ update ocas have lower priority
 blackburn	actually ocas is up-to-date here
 blackburn	:D
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, yes, sure, but I think the computation of a single x with the parallel algorithm is way faster
@sonney2k	I don't think so
@sonney2k	why should it?
 PhilTillet	because everything is done in a parallel maner
 Miggy	blackburn: ok so i want to know one thing...the previous 5 students can also apply this time...so how can a new student get chance?
 PhilTillet	with a looot of threads
 blackburn	Miggy: only 2 of us are applying
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, yes but bottleneck should be memory accesses
 Miggy	u and?
@sonney2k	so it doesn't matter if GPU or CPU is waiting
 blackburn	Heiko
 Miggy	rest?
 blackburn	Miggy: actually we have equal chances :)
 blackburn	I mean each should proceed in standart way
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, Oh I understand your point
 blackburn	Miggy: rest have dissappeared :D
 blackburn	s*
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, that is why I am saying try for multiple x (say 10k or more)
 Miggy	i mean they will definitely pick you because u have worked once with them
@sonney2k	and dim(x) = 100 or so
 blackburn	Miggy: even in this case we would have 6-7 slots and there is a room

 PhilTillet	sonney2k, are you talking about the kernel function?
 Miggy	i see
 PhilTillet	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CKernelMachine.html#adef2f22ca9c677e60635bbab682e117e . I thought on this formula the number of examples was N
 PhilTillet	this is why I am confused
 Miggy	i hope its not too late to contribute
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, the number of support vectors is N
@sonney2k	the number of vectors this formula is applied to is just 1
@sonney2k	(just one x)
 PhilTillet	Oh, I get it :p
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.179.147] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 blackburn	Miggy: sure, not late
 Miggy	so how many students are currently active on shogun?
 Miggy	this would give me an idea of my standing :P
 blackburn	Miggy: we've got contributions from 3 students already
 blackburn	(w/o me and Heiko)
 blackburn	last year there was a simple task which I come up with
 blackburn	kernel functions
 blackburn	:)
 PhilTillet	I understand sonney2k, it's like the difference between a matrix-vector and a matrix-matrix product :)
 Miggy	ok so can u suggest me something?
 Miggy	what type of contributions have they done?
 blackburn	Miggy: ok let me try
 blackburn	wiking has done HomogeneousKernelMap preprocessor
 blackburn	n4nd0 was working on qda
 blackburn	gsomix are working on python3
 blackburn	Miggy: how familiar you are with shogun's internals?
 Miggy	had a look last year
 Miggy	but was able to code comfortably
 blackburn	I am pretty interested with least angle regression but no idea if it would be appropriate to suggest
 Miggy	smthing in classification or clustering?
 blackburn	Miggy: some dataset downloader doing classification/regression and printing out results would be nice
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, support vectors and examples are stored columnwise, right ?
 Miggy	ok will look into that
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, yes
 PhilTillet	okay :)
 blackburn	Miggy: some simple extension like new kernel/distance are welcome as well
 Miggy	all the kernel functions have been already done :P
 blackburn	yeah even mahalanobis (which I forgot)
 blackburn	was done by n4nd0
 Miggy	so prvious year students who g
 Miggy	sry
 blackburn	;)
 Miggy	previous year students also applying this time?
 Miggy	the one who contributed previously?
 blackburn	no, only 2
 blackburn	we both have been contributing sinch last pre-gsoc period
 Miggy	i mean those who did smthing but were not selected
 blackburn	I think you are the first one of that kind
 Miggy	well i was late so i was not abe to give any patch that time
 blackburn	I see
 Miggy	i got to know abt shogun a little late :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: sudo answer me
 blackburn	damn is he kidding
 wiking	blackburn: don't forget the great jensen kernel :)))
 blackburn	oh yeah, Miggy: wiking has also done Jensen-Shannon kernel
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	I have not been aware of it for whole life
 blackburn	;)
 Miggy	err need some good patch
 Miggy	http://crsouza.blogspot.in/2010/03/kernel-functions-for-machine-learning.html
 blackburn	wiking: in fact I did not manage to use J-S explicitly
 Miggy	all have been done :P
 blackburn	it takes %INFINITY% time
 wiking	hahahaha
 blackburn	but marvellous homogay :D map is awesome
 wiking	but then i guess with the homomap was good ;)
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	best results are with intersection
 blackburn	no idea why
 wiking	mmm i've seen somebody today sending an email wanting to do the latent thingy
 blackburn	wiking: well you are a strong candidate on latent svms :D
 wiking	hehehhe :>
 wiking	i have to do some work with it
 wiking	but now i have so much stupid distractions
 wiking	i might be able to do it tomorrow
 n4nd0	blackburn: not abandoning SO man, no way :)
 wiking	at least class definitions
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am really investing time on there
 blackburn	n4nd0: so what is the problem?
 n4nd0	blackburn: none, I thought it could be better to apply to a second project just in case SO doesn't get selected finally or another studen takes it
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you think?
 blackburn	n4nd0: ah sure
 n4nd0	blackburn: I want to do SO for sure, but I'd like to get better chances
 blackburn	n4nd0: then you may also apply for ECOC/MC idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me check
 blackburn	wiking: btw in this vedaldi paper there are map for gaussian kernel, right?
 wiking	blackburn: not that i know of
 wiking	or i don't remember it having
 n4nd0	blackburn: which one is that? ECOC/MC
 blackburn	are there maps only for additive kernels?
 blackburn	n4nd0: multiclass
 blackburn	mentored by Soeren
 n4nd0	blackburn: isn't it that your target?

 blackburn	oh damn yeah

 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah the easiest way for me
 blackburn	n4nd0: swig would be competetive cause there is a student wants to work on that already
 blackburn	but multitask is pretty free :)
