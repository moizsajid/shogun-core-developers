 abinash	sonney2k: I want to work on the issue Fix and enable blacklisted integration tests.
 abinash	Could you please be more elaborate it
 gsomix	iglesiasg: improving of usability again or improving of dimensionality reduction module
@iglesiasg	aham the second one with sensei lisitsyn :)
 gsomix	iglesiasg: yep. it's cool project: ml+modern cpp+data structures...

 foulwall	hello guys
@iglesiasg	hey
 foulwall	iglesiasg: why the interactive_clustering_demo.py turns out different figure when I click the 'cluster' button ?
 sonne|work	foulwall: hey there!
 foulwall	sonne|work: I've write a clustering demo
 gsomix	foulwall: hi. nice support vector regression demo, btw
 sonne|work	foulwall: http://shogun-toolbox.org/demo/svr/entrance
 sonne|work	I put it live
 sonne|work	and I realized we still have some minor issues
 foulwall	yeah, the title of that page there are incorrect and a lot of improve we can make
 sonne|work	one was a bit critical - we needed to call .get_labels() to get the  numpy array - that is necessary due to an older numpy version
 sonne|work	foulwall: but what is important is that you validate input
 sonne|work	foulwall: e.g. for degree of kernel I could enter 'adfadf'
 sonne|work	and then that causes an exception
 sonne|work	so you should validate this in the server side (in python) and also in .js
 sonne|work	foulwall: back to your question - yes clustering can return different results - it is initialized with some  random number
 foulwall	ok, I'll do that, and pull request
@iglesiasg	foulwall: regarding the clustering example, it is using an algorithm kmeans that I think is randomly initialized
 sonne|work	foulwall: one more thing - please be cautious when taking code from other sources - the license has to be compatible with gplv3.
 foulwall	oh , I'll take care.
 gsomix	abinash: try asking sonne|work instead sonney2k now :)
 abinash	sonne|work I want to work  on the issue Fix and enable blacklisted integration tests
 abinash	could you please elaborate it
 sonne|work	hi abinash
 abinash	Hello sonne|work
 sonne|work	abinash: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/tests/integration/python_modular/generator.py
 sonne|work	look at this - inside is a variable blacklist
 sonne|work	these are the failing test / examples
 sonne|work	so just pick one
 abinash	ok
 sonne|work	and analyze it to death :)
 sonne|work	if you know why it fails tell us :)
 abinash	ok thanks, I would try it
 sonne|work	some for sure might be tough
 sonne|work	and others very easy
 abinash	Ok, I am thinking to pickup kernel_distance_modular.py
 abinash	Let me see whether it is tough or not
-!- abinash [~abinash@1.38.19.36] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 foulwall	sonne|work: iglesiasg http://foulwall.com:8000/demo/clustering/entrance a demo for clustering,left click for positive dots and right click for negative dots
@iglesiasg	foulwall: nice!
 foulwall	iglesiasg: thanks
 gsomix	foulwall: right cliks installs both dots: negative and positive, hm
 gsomix	*click
 foulwall	gsomix: sorry for that
 foulwall	I'll fix it
 sonne|work	foulwall: cool
@iglesiasg	gsomix: really? didn't note it here
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	foulwall: how did you point the circle?
 sonne|work	foulwall: it seems like separated dots?
 foulwall	use the polar system
 sonne|work	foulwall: no I mean doesn't d3 allow you to draw a circle?
@iglesiasg	foulwall: kmeans should work also fine for more than two classes so I guess the demo could also support that somehow
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: btw our kmeans is b0rken for say manhattan distance
 foulwall	ok i'll make d3 draw the circle
 gsomix	iglesiasg: just press right button, hold, and move aside
 gsomix	foulwall: cool demo :)
@iglesiasg	gsomix: mmm I only get clue dots here doing that
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: IIRC manhattan distance kmeans objective is minimized with median not mean
@iglesiasg	clue -> blue
 sonne|work	gsomix: doesn't happen here
 sonne|work	gsomix: which browser?
 gsomix	hm, strange. Chrome 26.0.1410.64 m, win64
 sonne|work	strange
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: why?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: recall the objective of kmeans - it is not minimized with mean for arbitrary distance
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: that's arbitrary no?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: but we put centers to the mean right?
 sonne|work	sure
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: does mean minimize inner cluster distance in case of manhattan distance?
 lisitsyn	mean is a minimizer of least squares (euclidean)
 lisitsyn	not the sum of absolute differences
 lisitsyn	afaik kmeans is not generic in that
 lisitsyn	it could work with spectral clustering when data is embedded to some euclidean space first
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I see what you mean but it is still OK as is if we document it
 foulwall	the demo is only a preview, I've found lotsof bugs in it, wait me and I'll show the perfect one.
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes sure - I am just totally unsure if results are any reasonable with other metrics
 gsomix	foulwall: sonne|work: iglesiasg: same in Firefox 20. probably I have problems with mouse...

@iglesiasg	hehe yeah it makes sense

 foulwall	gsomix: It's the code's problem

 sonne|work	foulwall: I think it would make more sense instead of right mouse button clicks to have some color buttons (say 10 or so) from which one can choose from
 sonne|work	and depending on which one is active you get a different label/color circle
 sonne|work	this probably is easier too
 sonne|work	and would work with unlimited number of classes
 sonne|work	foulwall: anyway now that you have this with left / right mouse keep it - we can at least use it for binary classification examples
 sonne|work	(or the first two colors)

@lisitsyn	I still didn't manage to get it working under M$ VS
@lisitsyn	so it is just to win a few milliseconds may be

 foulwall	hey guys
 foulwall	just finished bug fix
 foulwall	http://foulwall.com:8000/demo/clustering/entrance
 foulwall	no big change
 gsomix	foulwall: works proper, cool :)
 foulwall	sonney2k: gsomix: I'll update a pull request for this and the bug fix for the previous svr demo
 sonne|work	foulwall: nice
 foulwall	I added some check on the input so illegal input can be corrected
 sonne|work	foulwall: very good. btw I just tried out svr again. it would make sense to draw lines between the blue points
 sonne|work	foulwall: if someone draws some crazy function it looks a bit weird with all those gaps
 sonne|work	foulwall: ohh and I noted that one can put points outside of the coordinate system
 sonne|work	maybe better limit that
 sonne|work	foulwall: sorry one more wish... please make the range 0...1 on the x & y axis... this is better for the polynomial kernel
 foulwall	sonne|work: you means the user can put points in the negative area?
 sonne|work	left of the y axis currently
 sonne|work	just next to the axis
 sonne|work	and below they x axis too
 sonne|work	foulwall: sorry for all these (minor) comments...
 foulwall	sonne|work: that's easy
 foulwall	sonne|work: no problem, i'll fix those.
 foulwall	sonne|work: but the point left and bottom are legal and reasonable ones, and won't cause bugs
 sonne|work	but they are negative?
 foulwall	sonne|work: yep
 foulwall	sonne|work: anyway i'll fix it.
 foulwall	sonne|work: how to set parameter if I set the axis to range 0...1, the result turn out to be ugly
 foulwall	sonne|work: nothing need to be changed. my mistake
 sonne|work	foulwall: sorry I didn't understand
 foulwall	sonne|work: I've made a nonsense, ignore it
 sonne|work	:)

 foulwall	result curve is not so fitted
 foulwall	son

@lisitsyn	lambday: hey
 lambday	two questions - one.. say i am already in a feature branch... made some commits, but then I want to work on another feature branch.. and finish and push that one first..
 lambday	so,  if i just do git checkout develop... and then start the new feature branch... it will work?
@lisitsyn	you may change your branches
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	no problem
 lambday	lisitsyn: alright.. thanks... another question
 lambday	i think we'll be needing the SGSparseMatrix to eigen's SparseMatrix quite often.. we talked about it and you told that it will slow down the swig stuffs... is there any way, we could define this, some util may be, so that it doesn't harm much?
@lisitsyn	lambday: yes, just implement it in other class
@lisitsyn	that is not exposed to swig
 lambday	ummm.. okay let me check

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: ok, let me google a bit
