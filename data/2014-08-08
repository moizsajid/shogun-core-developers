@besser82	wiking, for some stuff you may need to add EPEL7-repos:  yum install http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/fedora-epel/beta/7/x86_64/epel-release-7-0.2.noarch.rpm
@besser82	wiking, yes CentOS / RHEL6 is abit old I think...
@besser82	wiking, if there is anything additional pkg you need for CentOS7 lemme know I can take to get it into EPEL7 =)
@wiking	besser82: same yum commands as in fedora?
@besser82	wiking, yes ^^  CentOS / RHEL7 is branched off from fc19
