@sonney2k	blackburn1, hey there
@sonney2k	any idea what happened to wiking?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: hey
 blackburn1	no idea
 blackburn1	if he was russian I'd had one
@sonney2k	blackburn1, which would be?
-!- Hausas [~admin@unaffiliated/hausas] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 blackburn1	we stay drunk till the end of holidays, but jk :)
@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw berlin airport won't open this year :D
@sonney2k	I am still lucky
 blackburn1	nice to you
@sonney2k	and I bet it won't open next year
@sonney2k	or the year after
@sonney2k	I bet on 2030 or never :D
-!- Hausas [~admin@unaffiliated/hausas] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	which certainly is long enough
 blackburn1	to grow up kids
@sonney2k	to enjoy the lake and live with kids :)
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	exactly
 blackburn1	to develop a missile as well
@sonney2k	yeah I should have some excursion to either US, israel or iran for that matter
@sonney2k	maybe just asking around here in germany is sufficient though :)
 blackburn1	iran is preferrable as we have shogun friend there :D
@sonney2k	blackburn1, IIRC we have visitors from .mil too
 blackburn1	haha
@sonney2k	so don't worry
@sonney2k	all your bugs will be KILLER features =:-)
 blackburn1	hah right
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I have been thinking about next year gsoc
 blackburn1	we should go for deep learning I am afraid
@sonney2k	we have no expert
@sonney2k	so that's a show stopper
 blackburn1	we should obtain one somewher
 blackburn1	it is too hot
 blackburn1	it is so hot I hurted myself and had a blister
@sonney2k	I will be at some ML summit this spring but I don't think it is likely that I can convince a stranger to mentor for that task
@sonney2k	blackburn1, we for sure should make a list of things we would like to have done before gsoc
@sonney2k	and for this release :)
 blackburn1	sonney2k: we should buy yann :D
 blackburn1	sonney2k: and it feels like I should be a mentor this time
 blackburn1	no idea may be I can get a little into this field which would allow me to lead that
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yeah but you have lots of other stuff going on too so no idea how you can make it
@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw I just plugged 32G of memory into my desktop machine
 blackburn1	full time job + studies appears to be hard :D
 blackburn1	but I am 21 yet so have power (yet)
@sonney2k	in case it runs smoothly I will create some buildbot for debian sid :)
@sonney2k	sounds like you will get some burnout soon
@sonney2k	don't overdo it
 blackburn1	any reason to have such great memory sizes?
@sonney2k	building shogun will require a machine with 6G at least
 blackburn1	26 to go
@sonney2k	26 what?
@sonney2k	a memory
@sonney2k	yes sure
@sonney2k	it is running a db and some other VMs if things work out
 blackburn1	I see
@sonney2k	and you know 4 cores == kill memory per thread
@sonney2k	blackburn1, n4nd0 made me aware that I have an h-index of 24. apparently that's quite ok hmmhh.
 blackburn1	I never knew about h-index
@sonney2k	it means I have h publications which got cited h times
 blackburn1	is it %Infty for me?
 blackburn1	:D
@sonney2k	max h is what we are looking for
 blackburn1	why wikipedia says galois has 2
 blackburn1	?
@sonney2k	so if you manage to submit your jmlr paper it will at least be 1
@sonney2k	(at some point)
 blackburn1	I will make my second effort to do that this month
@sonney2k	blackburn1, If you didn't waste^H^H^H^Hinvest so much time in making it tapkee you probably would have had it already
@sonney2k	good luck!
 blackburn1	no it is not a waste of time, I learned a  few things
 blackburn1	sonney2k: it was much harder to describe why it is not shogun
 blackburn1	it is a philosophical problem
 blackburn1	I'd have to cite nietzsche
 blackburn1	to describe why I hate situation I am in
 blackburn1	:D
@sonney2k	ohh please don't
@sonney2k	I might find myself trapped in some brain twist
 blackburn1	it would be nice to see zarathustra cite in ml paper
 blackburn1	sonney2k: have you ever read some classics like kant?
 blackburn1	I am curious how difficult it is to understand in original language
 blackburn1	translation sucks :(
-!- heiko [~heiko@p57972A37.dip.t-dialin.net] has joined #shogun
 blackburn1	heiko: may be you? have you ever read kant?
 heiko	blackburn, yes I have, why do you ask?
 heiko	10 years ago  in school :D
 blackburn1	heiko: I am curious how difficult it is
 blackburn1	in original language
 heiko	max + 3
 blackburn1	hah
 heiko	try something else :)
 blackburn1	well I have read let me remember
@sonney2k	heiko, btw I fixed some build failures in you last commits no idea if I did it the way you intended things
 heiko	sonney2k, thanks for that, I was busy with family over the last days and was not at a computer
 heiko	sonney2k, what did you do?
 blackburn1	Kritik der reinen Vernunft
 blackburn1	in russian translation
 heiko	sonney2k, all this lapack stuff, I see
 heiko	blackburn, Kritik der reinen Vernunft is one of the most difficult books ever written in German
 blackburn1	heiko: lolz
 blackburn1	quite difficult in any lang
 heiko	yes, even in German its like learning a new language
 heiko	since all the words have Kant's own defined meanings
 blackburn1	IIRC he heavily introduced apriori  and aposteriori
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, do you know the state of java_modular? does it work?
 blackburn1	and a few more things like ehmm synthetic
 heiko	blackburn, yeah he was the original Bayesian
 blackburn1	haha
@sonney2k	heiko, it should - at least tests do
 heiko	sonney2k, in order to make classes available, do I need to do anything more than for python_modular?
 blackburn1	no, why?
 blackburn1	in lapack we trust only
 heiko	just curios, I never ran java
 blackburn1	java is the only way to do java
 heiko	cool, a guy asked me about kernel mmd stuff and he is using java
 blackburn1	java fur immer!
 blackburn1	:D
 heiko	hehe :)
 heiko	gonna go to bed now, sleep well guys!
 blackburn1	may the force be with you :D
 heiko	and with you blackburn!
-!- heiko [~heiko@p57972A37.dip.t-dialin.net] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	blackburn1, you know there is this issue with the force, it has a dark (black) side...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes both works

@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw you should work in gunnars lab
@sonney2k	I just ssh'd into one machine and it had 512 G of memory
@sonney2k	RAM
@sonney2k	not harddrive
 blackburn1	hah
 blackburn1	powerful enough
@sonney2k	compiling shogun there is a non-issue
@sonney2k	takes < 1 minute
@sonney2k	not even sure if we have enough files to satisfy all CPUs ;-)
 blackburn1	haha
