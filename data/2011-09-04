 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rd744130 / src/shogun/kernel/HistogramWordStringKernel.cpp : Resolved HistogramWordStringKernel testsuite issue - http://git.io/ucuI5A
 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was thinking about more 'modular' structure of shogun
 blackburn	i.e. we have to update libsvm/etc and store it's sources
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	can you see any way to do it more elegant?
@sonney2k	blackburn, we don't have original libsvm in there
@sonney2k	it is changed at various places
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do we have?
@sonney2k	I modified some parts
 blackburn	ain't it a problem?
@sonney2k	like shogun's kernels are used
@sonney2k	we can train with bias turned off
@sonney2k	and some features removed like libsvms x-val
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh and ctrl+c handling
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see
@sonney2k	the only way around this is some callback function support *in libsvm* for all the things we need
@sonney2k	not sure if cj-lin would like this
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have some thoughts that do the things like we planned to do with c50 is the right way
 blackburn	sth loosely bounded
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean not integrate but just use?
 blackburn	yes, just wrap things if it is possible
@sonney2k	it is tough - because we want c5.0 to use our data format
 blackburn	sonney2k: we got some offense on that russian forum hehe
-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: buildmaster reconfigured: bot disconnecting]
@sonney2k	blackburn, because of what?
 blackburn	1. Manual memory management is scattered throughout the project.
 blackburn	2. Pointers and passing by the signs, where to be passing by reference and objectswith smart pointers inside.
 blackburn	3. Sewn into the code data types. How much will it cost to replace mathematicsfloat64_t on float32_t?
 blackburn	4. Lack of const.
 blackburn	In order to avoid any questions asked here this code
 blackburn	void set_global_version (Version * version);
 blackburn	Version * get_global_version ();
 blackburn	should look like this:
 blackburn	void set_global_version (const Version & version);
 blackburn	Version get_global_version () const;
 blackburn	5. Class variables should be different from the local: x_ instead of x.
 blackburn	via google translate

@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not a big fan of the const stuff
@sonney2k	const business causes all kinds of issues - but YMMV
@sonney2k	class variables are different than the local
@sonney2k	they should be m_x instead of x
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand 3
 blackburn	sonney2k: he said we use float64_t everywhere
@sonney2k	regarding 1-2 - if someone has a better idea how to make this work with swig we sure should use it if it is more elegant?
@sonney2k	blackburn, and?
@sonney2k	I don't understand the problem
 blackburn	and if we wanted to change that - it would be pain in the ass
@sonney2k	sed s/float64_t/double/
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	I don't know what to answer
@sonney2k	I guess he meant that changing float64 -> float32 is hard?
@sonney2k	this is something one should / cannot do
@sonney2k	that is why one chooses float64 / 32 for a reason
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: he makes me sad :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.linux.org.ru/news/opensource/6689178 try to read my last answers heh

 blackburn	sonney2k: hey but why/
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	reconfiguring
@sonney2k	apache is just too slow
@sonney2k	I am trying to switch to fapws3 and pound
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah I see

@sonney2k	blackburn, still there?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeap
@sonney2k	does shogun-toolbox.org load faster for you?
@sonney2k	or some doc behind it?
 blackburn	~ same
 blackburn	will try doc
 blackburn	yeah faster
@sonney2k	k
@sonney2k	blackburn, that's nginx running instead of apache now
 blackburn	sonney2k: as expected :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the colours you like?
@sonney2k	no idea
 blackburn	ok :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: why you called shogun as shogun? do you like japanese %anything? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, soeren & gunnar (well ok my name does not really start with sho but remotely similar)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I know but it is kinda hard to pronounce, etc
@sonney2k	reason or raeson would not have been better
@sonney2k	(I did prefer shogun)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about logo without these glyphs?
@sonney2k	well I like the glyphs
@sonney2k	kanjis :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok got an idea
