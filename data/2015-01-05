 nszceta	greetings all
 nszceta	I have encountered a linker error https://bpaste.net/show/e441cdbdc58c
 nszceta	on CentOS 7
@wiking	oooh
@wiking	i'm currently building shogun on centos7 w/o problems
@wiking	this is how i run cmake: mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
@wiking	and then i compile simpley with: make -j4
@wiking	and then i just run the tests: ctest --output-on-failure -j2
@wiking	nszceta: so i'm wondering what could b wrong on your side
@wiking	could u tell me how u run cmake?
 nszceta	sure thing
 nszceta	mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DPythonModular=ON .. && make
@wiking	okey
@wiking	that ran fine right?
 nszceta	nope
 nszceta	just rm -rf'd build and I am doing it again to get output
 nszceta	here's what cmake has so far https://bpaste.net/show/d948188f7ba6
@wiking	ok cool
@wiking	run make now
 nszceta	8%
@wiking	btw you'll need to install some more packages on your distribution
@wiking	otherwise you'll miss most of the new features of shogun
 nszceta	what would you recommend
 nszceta	I got atlas blas-devel... can't remember what else
@wiking	eigen
 nszceta	that is EPEL
@wiking	and?
@wiking	i mean sorry i'm just suggesting
 nszceta	sure
@wiking	u do what you really need to do
 nszceta	what does Eigen bring to the table
@wiking	we use eigen in most of our new implementations
@wiking	basically anything that is deep learning, GP and some more
 nszceta	will install
 nszceta	I'm going to CTRL-C this make and get Eigen from EPEL before I go further
@wiking	k

 nszceta	@wiking it's still not working
 nszceta	https://bpaste.net/show/fd26ab2dafde
 nszceta	what package do I need to compile from source?
 nszceta	weirdly enough I have double cblas_dnrm2(const int N, const double *X, const int incX); in /usr/include/cblas.h
 nszceta	so it seems like I already have the functions that error out during make
 nszceta	not sure what is going on here...

@wiking	nszceta: ping?
 nszceta	hey
 nszceta	I've been up since a few hours compiling ATLAS and LAPACK
 nszceta	everything is still all ate up
@wiking	compiling atlas?
@wiking	why didn't u install it with yum?
 nszceta	didn't work
 nszceta	I had it installed
@wiking	oh no
 nszceta	shogun complained of missing symbols
@wiking	yeah but that could have fixed
 nszceta	anyway shogun cmake never ever detected ATLAS
@wiking	another wahy
@wiking	*way
 nszceta	o ok, I can remove the libraries I compiled
 nszceta	what do you recommend
@wiking	so i have these package installed under centos7
* nszceta takes note
@wiking	lapack.x86_64                                3.4.2-4.el7                @base
@wiking	lapack-devel.x86_64                          3.4.2-4.el7                @base
@wiking	atlas.x86_64                                 3.10.1-7.el7               @base
@wiking	atlas-devel.x86_64                           3.10.1-7.el7               @base
@wiking	blas.x86_64                                  3.4.2-4.el7                @base
@wiking	blas-devel.x86_64                            3.4.2-4.el7                @base
@wiking	eigen3-devel.noarch                          3.2.2-1.el7                @epel
@wiking	but of course if u want i can give you the full list of packages installed on that instance
 nszceta	wiking thanks a lot for helping me out. I'll give you an update in a minute
@wiking	k
 nszceta	just ran a $ sudo yum -y install lapack lapack-devel atlas atlas-devel blas blas-devel eigen3-devel
 nszceta	wiking, https://dpaste.de/jp8h/raw
 nszceta	atlas is still not detected
 nszceta	-- Could NOT find ATLAS (missing:  ATLAS_LIBRARIES)
@wiking	nszceta: what version of shogun r u trying to use
@wiking	?
 nszceta	3.2
 nszceta	I do have /usr/lib64/atlas/libsatlas.so.3.10
 nszceta	and libsatlas and libtatlas
@wiking	here's the cmake output: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/CentOS7%20-%20libshogun/builds/139/steps/configure/logs/stdio
 nszceta	weird, it doesn't find ATLAS either
@wiking	nszceta: oh so you are saying that you are trying to use the src downloaded from the website
@wiking	?
 nszceta	I downloaded shogun source
 nszceta	what do you mean
@wiking	ok so
@besser82	nszceta, add `-DATLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so -DATLAS_LAPACK=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so` to your cmake-command  ;)
@wiking	nszceta: use the latest version
 nszceta	what do you mean latest version?
 nszceta	git master?
 nszceta	besser82 trying that out
@wiking	nszceta: git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
@besser82	nszceta, checkout from github
@besser82	nszceta, yes
@besser82	nszceta, and those additional switches for cmake  ;)
 nszceta	oh boy
 nszceta	nothing like bleeding edge :D
@wiking	besser82: no that should't be required for the git develop cmake anymore
@wiking	besser82: it works out of box
@wiking	besser82: on centos7 ;) see buildbot output
 shogun-buildbot	build #2620 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2620  blamelist: sanuj <sanuj.sharma.in@gmail.com>, Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Bj?rn Esser <bjoern.esser@gmail.com>
@besser82	wiking, allrighty, ic  ;)
 nszceta	I thought you just showed me that wiking and it clearly says it doesn't see ATLAS
 nszceta	-- Could NOT find ATLAS (missing:  ATLAS_LIBRARIES)
 nszceta	in the build bot output
@wiking	nszceta: :D
 nszceta	what's going on
@wiking	true :DDD
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	but still
@wiking	it works
@wiking	:>>>
 nszceta	wtf lol
@wiking	ok let's just try with the latest github
@wiking	git version
@wiking	i think the errors you have is do to missing safeguards (macros) in the examples
 nszceta	ok but we need to sort out ATLAS somehow also later
@wiking	nszceta: why? :)
 nszceta	performance?
@wiking	i mean yeah we need a fix for cmake
@wiking	true
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but trust me
@wiking	you rather want eigen
@wiking	because we are slowly switching everything to eigen
 nszceta	I get that but how much is in eigen
 nszceta	how much in atlas
 nszceta	and also why eigen?
@wiking	most of it is in eigen
 nszceta	isn't atlas really old and tried and true?
@wiking	nszceta: since it's a header only library
@wiking	yeah and it is requiring fortran
@wiking	and binary compiled libraries
 nszceta	what's wrong with fortran lol
 nszceta	if it works...
@wiking	while eigen doesn't need anything
 nszceta	alright fair enough
@wiking	and that works for not only on x86 arch
 nszceta	ATLAS only works on x86?
@wiking	i dont know if it has for example NEON optimization
 nszceta	alright I am building shogun with -j16 lets see how this works :D
@wiking	(see arm)
@wiking	i know that atlas has MMX, SSE2 optimization
@wiking	i assue they haven't done arm optimization
@wiking	*assume
@wiking	so yeah eigen is lightweight but a bit more updated with current technologies
@wiking	lapack blas and all that is great
@wiking	but it's a bit ancient....
@wiking	which is not bad... just sometimes having the zxcqy as a function name
@wiking	is driving u crazy
 nszceta	lol

 marina	happy new year everyone!
 marina	I want to execute the following code
 marina	pm = PerformanceMeasures(labels_test, output); acc = pm.get_accuracy();
 marina	the problem is, that python could not find the method PerformanceMeasures...
 marina	I have already imported shogun.Evaluation
 marina	anyone who can help?
@besser82	guess who  :P
 marina	:D
 nszceta	ok it failed
 nszceta	wiking same error
 nszceta	https://dpaste.de/owtn/raw
@wiking	nszceta: whooooooo whooo
@wiking	we got to the impossible
@wiking	as the exact same thing works on my centos7
 nszceta	wtf!
@wiking	besser82: care to elaborate here?
 nszceta	suggestions are welcome :D
@besser82	wiking, sure  :D
@besser82	nszceta, did you try my additional cmake-switches, yet?
 nszceta	about to :D
 nszceta	it found atlas with -DATLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so -DATLAS_LAPACK=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so

@wiking	nszceta: shogun magic :)
@wiking	we should rather fix the cmake script i reckon
@besser82	wiking, who wrote it?  :P
* wiking 
@wiking	does that mean that i have to fix it as well?
@wiking	isnt' this supposed to be an OSS project
@wiking	?
 nszceta	cmake/FindAtlas.lulz
 nszceta	* shogun/cmake/FindAtlas.cmake
@wiking	nszceta: yep... actualy that is taken from some random oss project
 nszceta	wtf shogun/src/shogun/lib/SGVector.h:57: Warning 503: Can't wrap 'operator std::complex< double >*' unless renamed to a valid identifier.
@wiking	nszceta: so that could be updated :)
 nszceta	:D
@wiking	nszceta: dont worry about that
@wiking	but if u worry about it, fix it plz
@besser82	wiking, lemme check for some updated version =)
 nszceta	k
@wiking	you have all u need for it :)
@wiking	besser82: thnx
 nszceta	just to recap
 nszceta	after make I just run make install and that's that?
@wiking	nszceta: regarding what ?:)
@wiking	it all depends what u want
 nszceta	installing shogun
@wiking	yeah
 nszceta	I am in my python virtual environment
@wiking	that shoudl do it
 nszceta	i just need it to work with python
 nszceta	sweet
@wiking	oh virtual env
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	that's a totally different story
 nszceta	of course
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i mean if u want to have shogun within the virtenv
 nszceta	of course
@wiking	ok if u know how to fix that
@wiking	since then u need to ship the .so within the virtualenv
 nszceta	ye
@wiking	nszceta: might i ask what's the usecase in your case for shogun/
 nszceta	machine learning systems for SemanticMD
 nszceta	in particular we are interested in LMNN
@wiking	:)
@wiking	for that it's not lmnn what u want
@wiking	but that's my 2 cents
@wiking	(i did my phd recently on this topic)
@wiking	most of the stuff i was doing within shogun was regarding that
 nszceta	we have been investigating using LMNN stacked with opencv
 nszceta	Very nice. I'm not experienced with ML but my team is.
@wiking	that's only my 2 cents
 nszceta	what is it about LMNN that makes you think it is not the best choice
@wiking	well
@wiking	i've used it
@wiking	i mean i don't know what's your dataset size
 nszceta	also for the record this worked: $ cmake -DPythonModular=ON -DATLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so -DATLAS_LAPACK=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so ..
@wiking	but lmnn will blow up your qp quite fast
@wiking	but anyhow we'd be happy to hear if you are using shogun itself
 nszceta	sure
@wiking	note that it's still gplv3
 nszceta	mhmm
 shogun-buildbot	build #184 of trusty - libshogun - viennacl is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/trusty%20-%20libshogun%20-%20viennacl/builds/184
@wiking	there was an initiative to switch to 3 clause bsd but that's still an ongoing operation
 nszceta	it shouldn't be an issue at all
@wiking	well it is for a lot of companies
 nszceta	we are strictly SaaS
@wiking	that's why actually a lot of times it is not being used
@wiking	and?
@wiking	u dont see how that solves the licensing issue
 nszceta	the software is not being distributed
@wiking	yes but still you'll have to opensource the whole module that is linked to shogun
@wiking	or for that matter whatever gplvX code is being used..
@wiking	in an ideal case
 nszceta	shogun will be linked to another module which produces output that is served by a web server and in such a case it does not matter what license is used
@wiking	it does
@wiking	a good read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html
@besser82	wiking, not by meanings of "offer sources"

 nszceta	I saw the writing on the wall :P
 nszceta	now that there is a big push to eigen
@wiking	well it's easy to depend on it
 nszceta	thank god for ATLAS though
@wiking	as you can see the whole blas is very messed up

@wiking	i mean the json thingy
@besser82	wiking, working on it ^^
@wiking	kk
 nszceta	what do you guys use shogun for?
@wiking	well that's a good question
@wiking	we are not aware of any other usage
@wiking	other than our own phds
@wiking	or masters
@wiking	sometimes we saw some ppl from thomsonreuters and yahoo

@lisitsyn	wiking: holidays till 11th
@wiking	yeah new year's is just about to come

@lisitsyn	yeah russia is dead after new year
@lisitsyn	just consider there is no such country as it is totally passive
@wiking	well the bear needs a sleep aswell :)
@lisitsyn	nszceta: that's actually quite close to true :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: usd/rub = 3600/(brent)
@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: putin said the more roubles USD cost the more money we have
@wiking	marina: where did u get this PerformanceMeasures(...) from ?
@wiking	lisitsyn: he is so true!
@lisitsyn	wiking: zimbabwe is quite a rich country huh
@lisitsyn	everybody is a billionaire
 nszceta	lisitsyn made my day
@lisitsyn	:D
 nszceta	are you joking?
@lisitsyn	nope ;)
 nszceta	zimbabwean billionaires are poor
 nszceta	http://nowiknow.com/wp-content/uploads/zimbabwe-100-trillion-dollar-bill-obverse.jpg
@lisitsyn	but they are billionaires! :D
@wiking	but they are still billionaires :)
 nszceta	no, look
@wiking	lisitsyn: we used to have that though...
@lisitsyn	yeah I am kidding ;)
 nszceta	100 trillion dollar bill :D
@wiking	lisitsyn: 10E12
@wiking	bill
@wiking	i think i still have a copy somewhere in the attick :)
 nszceta	they couldnt fit more zeros on the bill so they threw in the towel
@lisitsyn	it is quite difficult to pay some tips there I guess
 nszceta	just throw down 400 trillion dollars
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	:D
 nszceta	should be enough for a tip
@wiking	oh noooo
@wiking	we had 5E11 :)
@lisitsyn	so you go to some restaurant
@lisitsyn	order some stuff
@lisitsyn	and while you eat it gets another zero
@wiking	lisitsyn: yep that was the case
@wiking	lisitsyn: till u got from the bank to the black market exchange
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	actually usd/rub was similar
@wiking	your montly salary went down to be enough to buy 2 bread and some milk
@lisitsyn	people were rushing to local exchanges
@wiking	heheh yeah usual shit

@lisitsyn	performance measure hmm
@lisitsyn	I think I wrote something about that
@lisitsyn	hahha zero obama
@wiking	420 would have been more classy
