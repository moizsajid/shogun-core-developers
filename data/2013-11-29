 sonne|work	besser82: that sounds easy to resolve use a hydrogen-fuse-accellerator to fix the instability of the yeto-wave that in turn will make the crungo-factor a non issue!
@wiking	?:D
 besser82	sonne|work: Many thanks for that nifty hint!  :D
 besser82	wiking: Back to future  ;)
 besser82	wiking: the movie, you know?
@wiking	pathc?
* besser82 watch these way back when had been a little nerd  :D
 besser82	wiking: pathc?!? You mean `patch`, rye?
 besser82	wiking: Patch will be supplied when all is finished and proven to work 100%  ;)
 besser82	wiking: one simply can't build Rome within a week  ;)
 besser82	wiking: at least when he needs to do some $$$-work, too  ;)
@wiking	besser82: well maaaybe if u would create a feature branch and do WIP commits that some could help out
@wiking	and as a good sideeffect u would right away have travis ci on it already
 besser82	wiking: working on that, need to finish the polish of bare libshogun && rebase; then I'll kick in feature_branch....
 besser82	wiking: and prepare the modules for push to that  ;)

 taylan	Hi everyone..
 taylan	I have a small issue with the compilation of director support..
 taylan	particularly in the CDirectorDistance class,
 taylan	it is asking for 2 functions, which did exist previously I think..
 taylan	result = (float64_t *)(arg1)->shogun::CDirectorDistance::get_distance_matrix_real(*arg2,*arg3,arg4);
 taylan	result = (float32_t *)(arg1)->shogun::CDirectorDistance::get_distance_matrix_shortreal(*arg2,*arg3,arg4);
 taylan	I see these methods in the 3.0 tar-ball release, but they are removed from git..
 taylan	Am I doing sth wrong?
 taylan	I use this cmake command: cmake  -DUSE_SWIG_DIRECTORS=ON  -DPythonModular=ON .
 lisitsyn	taylan: hey
 lisitsyn	I am checking
 taylan	I can create these functions back, returning null but I am not sure about the consequences..
 lisitsyn	taylan: hah no
 lisitsyn	taylan: but where are they used?
 lisitsyn	I can't find usages in current git
 taylan	me neither, should be auto-generated by swig..
 lisitsyn	taylan: could you please try to clean up your local repo to avoid some garbage left?
 taylan	I am doing a clean clone..
 taylan	is there a way to clean the codebase through make?
 taylan	same error on the clean checkout
 taylan	lisitsyn: do you see the same error on a clean checkout?
 taylan	another info: I am compiling in parallel, with make -j8
 lisitsyn	taylan: let me check
 taylan	lisistsyn: if I create swig python output (modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx), by adding those functions, and then recompiling without, I don't think it regenerates the output, so it works in that case
 taylan	I get the same error if I use the clean checkout
 sonne|work	taylan: do you perhaps still have an old shogun version installed?
 sonne|work	taylan: if so delete it - it might be mixing up headers etc
