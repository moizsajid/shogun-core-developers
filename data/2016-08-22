 Saurabh7	wiking: there ?
@wiking	yep
 Saurabh7	wiking: was thinking if I should make a cpp for TreeMachine.h, to put the generate_matrix there
 Saurabh7	since eigen is used
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	sounds reasonable
 Saurabh7	ah crap its treemachine is templated
@wiking	Saurabh7, why's that a problem?
@wiking	i mean actually
@wiking	would be great
@wiking	to have a random rotation
@wiking	of not only float64_t
@wiking	i mean this could be a simple linalg module right/
@wiking	i mena a random rotation matrix itself
@wiking	:)
 Saurabh7	yes it can be anywhere
@wiking	as it actually depends on linalg operators right?
@wiking	and actually would be great to have a version
@wiking	that could use later linalg with gpu backend
@wiking	(as the paper suggests that with inputs of bigger feature sets than 1000
@wiking	it'd be better to use gpu)
@wiking	see what i mean?
 Saurabh7	yes Larger rotation matrices can be computed with GPU assistance
@wiking	so
@wiking	i suggest
@wiking	let's create actually a patch for linalg backend :D
@wiking	and ping OXPHOS there
@wiking	and it's a linalg operator
@wiking	to create a RR matrix
 Saurabh7	so i move this PR there ?
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so close this PR
@wiking	it's a good start but
@wiking	we need to create a branch
@wiking	based of her linalg feature branch
@wiking	lemme see
 Saurabh7	ok and that colwise() thing too, I couldn't find that one in linalg too
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/feature/linalg_refactor
@wiking	ok so use this as a base one for your PRs
@wiking	and lets do it from there
@wiking	ok?
 Saurabh7	yep
@wiking	and then we check with OXPHOS
@wiking	how she likes it
@wiking	lemme look into the whole story of randoms
@wiking	https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev/issues/128
@wiking	shit :(
@wiking	ok we should add actually a random generator for gpu matrix
@wiking	http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10/research/rngs-gpu-mwc64x.html
@wiking	:)
@wiking	anyhow that's not important now
@wiking	just to ship this into linalg
@wiking	so there we can leverage the gpu backend
@wiking	i reckon there are a lot of operators not supported atm
@wiking	(QR decomposition etc....)
@wiking	but it'll get there
 Saurabh7	uhm yes some more operators are needed
 Saurabh7	cl
@wiking	Saurabh7: that's ok... we can start from somewhere
@wiking	:)
 Saurabh7	ye sure:)
 Saurabh7	wiking: that feature branch might need rebase
@wiking	i can rebase it
@wiking	that's no problem
@wiking	Saurabh7, oh wait :)
 Saurabh7	lol its showing heikos comments
@wiking	couldn't you just take the
@wiking	last 2 commits
@wiking	that you did
@wiking	like
@wiking	git format-patch -2
@wiking	then checkout the feature branch
@wiking	from that create a new branch
@wiking	apply the 2 patches
@wiking	and create the pr :)
@wiking	i closed this one
 Saurabh7	wiking: yes the branch missing quite some changes to randomforest tho
 Saurabh7	and also to distance
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	lemme try to rebase
@wiking	Saurabh7, we have a little problem
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/distance/EuclideanDistance.cpp#L94
@wiking	this does not use linalg::dot
@wiking	right?
 Saurabh7	yes it doesnt
@wiking	is it because it is a CDotFeautres?
 Saurabh7	inside dotfeatures->dot i think cmath:dot is used
@wiking	ok that'll need to change
@wiking	but that's ok
 Saurabh7	wiking: I will just send the PR with commits, not much is overlapping in this case
 Saurabh7	* with 2 commits
@wiking	ok i mean i've managed to rebase the branch
@wiking	but i would need to double check with OXPHOS
@wiking	before overwriting her stuff
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	needed some pretty straightforward merges to be done
@wiking	but still wanna make sure that she is ok with them
@wiking	could you do those 2 commits for RRforest
@wiking	on top of her branch?
 Saurabh7	yes will do ,
@wiking	thnx a lot
 Saurabh7	done, except my branch is called "linala" :P
@wiking	ok
@wiking	Saurabh7, added some comments
@wiking	as now you are tailoring the matrix operations for eigen
@wiking	where that branch already should have the basic operations for matrix
@wiking	there
@wiking	so those should be used instead of direct eigen calls

 Saurabh7	ok will replace them
 sanuj	Saurabh7, do you get the mail if i mail to shogun-list?
 sanuj	no right?
@wiking	mailing list if foobar?
 Saurabh7	sanuj: I am subscribed why wont I ? :)

 CaBa	hi everyone
 Saurabh7	CaBa: hey
 CaBa	http://pastebin.com/EGzpVx1b <- i'm slightly confused with rows and columns and SGMatrices...
 CaBa	this matrix should have 5 rows and 2 columns...
 CaBa	am i missing something here? CCSVfile has a bool transpose member, which should be false by default... also it doesn't say "transposes output" but something like "assumes input to be transposed" in the docs...
 CaBa	*confused*
@wiking	CaBa: in shogun the data is columnar oriented
@wiking	it has been like this for the last 15 years
@wiking	while lately other libraries start to realise why is it better like this :P
@wiking	    SGMatrix<float64_t> test_matrix(5,2);
 CaBa	wiking: are you talking about how the matrix is represented in memory?
@wiking	 = 5 columns and 2 rows
@wiking	mmm no
@wiking	yeah that should be actually 2 columns and 5 rows
@wiking	but the columns are actually rows
@wiking	in memory
@wiking	but you dont care about that
 CaBa	there is no such thing as columns and rows in memory...
@wiking	so i dont get what's the problem
@wiking	CaBa: yes there is
@wiking	 :)
 CaBa	??
@wiking	but yeah nevermind1
@wiking	so what's the confusion?
 CaBa	but i do mind
 CaBa	well the confusion is that the constructor doc says (nrows, ncols) and the CSV representation is transposed
@wiking	?
@wiking	i see from the comment
@wiking	that your output is actually
@wiking	2x5
@wiking	ok
@wiking	lemme check
@wiking	where does the transposition happens
 CaBa	thanks
@wiking	CaBa, ok so apparently we think in csv that the 'standard' is row oriented matrix
 CaBa	wiking: so the transposition is only an output matter?
@wiking	hence yep
@wiking	so it'll just transpose the output
@wiking	not the matrix itself
@wiking	so if you do
@wiking	out_file.set_transpose(true);
@wiking	then you should get the right output format
@wiking	but it will not touch the matrix itself
@wiking	you should get the right (5x2) csv
@wiking	but could you please doublecheck it plz
@wiking	but yeah actually i have a refactor already in place in a feature branch for IO
@wiking	but i had other stuff to be fixed first
@wiking	(see windows and javascript
@wiking	but will try to clear up the chaos with IO
 CaBa	wiking: with set_transpose(true) wirred things happen
@wiking	lolface
@wiking	what happened?
@wiking	CaBa, we apparently have a unittest for csvfile
@wiking	lemme check how's that passing at all
@wiking	:)))
 CaBa	hrhr
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/KP9nXqtR
@wiking	CaBa, btw
 CaBa	wiking: dimensionality is right, but now i have duplicate values ;-)
@wiking	can you please try this
@wiking	i mean its very stupid
@wiking	but still
 CaBa	^^
@wiking	out_file.set_matrix(test_matrix.matrix, test_matrix.num_cols, test_matrix.num_rows);
@wiking	:)
@wiking	(instead of test_matrix.save(&out_file);
@wiking	this is just a shitty patch for your problem
@wiking	but yeah IO backend obviously needs fixing
 CaBa	wiking: that yields a new version
 CaBa	0,5,6.947329467503763e-310,6.054570769733804e-310,0
 CaBa	1,6,6.947329468445254e-310,0,0
 CaBa	reading memory that it shouldn't be reading..
@wiking	muhaha
@wiking	and if you flip the args?
 CaBa	ah wait
 CaBa	that was probably the second case with transposed on...
@wiking	yeah dont turn that on
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	anyways, without transpose...
 CaBa	0,1
 CaBa	2,3
 CaBa	4,5
 CaBa	6,7
 CaBa	8,9
 CaBa	i now get a different representation of my memory
 CaBa	no we are talking "by row" vs "by column" representation of matrices
 CaBa	*now
@wiking	CaBa, btw
@wiking	test_matrix[i] returns a row
@wiking	right? :)
 CaBa	shouldn't
@wiking	i mean what should it retunr?
@wiking	i mean in this case column
 CaBa	T&
@wiking	but stull
@wiking	still
@wiking	you are not setting the whole matrix
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.220.49.100] has joined #shogun
@wiking	with that for loop
@wiking	ok yeah
 CaBa	wiking: yes i am... the subscript operator gives access to the linear in-memory representation
@wiking	actually you should be able to
@wiking	but now the output is good no? :)
 CaBa	no, i think save() gives the correct output
@wiking	shouldn't you get a 5x2 output
@wiking	?
@wiking	i mean with a SGMatrix<float64> x(5,2);
 CaBa	wiking: it delinearizes the wrong way
 CaBa	wiking: http://pastebin.com/qdcMt0es
 CaBa	whatever - i don't mind much about the output, i just wanted to make sure it's just an output related confusion
@wiking	it is
@wiking	but a good catch
@wiking	:))))
@wiking	in memory it should be in a good way
@wiking	but yeah seems the serialization is totally fucked up
@wiking	:))))
@wiking	jesus this library :)
@wiking	no wonder nobody uses it
@wiking	we cannot even get CSV in/out normally
@wiking	lisitsyn, ^ :D
 lisitsyn	meh
 lisitsyn	rewrite
@wiking	yep
@wiking	gsomix wrote that
@wiking	where is he? :D
@wiking	:))
 lisitsyn	wiking: married
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	= died
@wiking	:>>>>>
 sanuj	lisitsyn, lambday is about to die soon then
 lisitsyn	walking dead
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i have started reading deeplearningbook.org
 sanuj	it's good
