 c4goldsw	wiking question: I started off by making EuclideanDistance generic, which would also involve making it's parent class generic (which would then involve making all descendents of the base class generic).  So, at this point, it seems as if I'd have to do this for all distance classes (I count  + 15).  I should try to find something with fewer depende
 c4goldsw	ncies and start over, right?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Lars update
@wiking	just merged some updates there
@wiking	but that thing prettey much assumes the same thing
@wiking	that the features is actually DenseFeatures<float64_t>
@wiking	(only
@wiking	which is for no reason :P
 c4goldsw	Haha, ok, I'll pull that then.  I have a git question too
 c4goldsw	I have PR on my develop branch that is still  open - if I want to start working on new work, should I make a new branch?
 c4goldsw	And work from there?
@wiking	either that or just recreate the branch
@wiking	delete and create
@wiking	:)
 c4goldsw	Which would also delete the PR, right?
@wiking	noup
@wiking	but no reason to delete the pr
@wiking	the pr will just monitor that branch
 c4goldsw	Great, thanks for the info.
@wiking	which i suppose u wanna have
@wiking	if not
@wiking	then just close the pr via github
 c4goldsw	I'll keep it open, just want to make sure it isn't affected.
@wiking	mmm buildbot is sick :(
 c4goldsw	wiking: Since LARS inherits from CLinearMachine, which inherits from CMachine, should I just make the methods in LARs generic rather than the whole class?
@wiking	what exactly do you mean
@wiking	i mean the problem in lars is this exactly
@wiking	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
@wiking	Saurabh7: still here?
@wiking	c4goldsw: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L118
 c4goldsw	Sure, I have the line open in front of me.
@wiking	Saurabh7: you've forgot this here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L13
@wiking	Saurabh7: you've removed all the lapack dependencies no?
@wiking	because then i reckon we should remove https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L13 and https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L406
 c4goldsw	wiking you know what, never mind.  I just realised that there shouldn't be a problem with making the whole class generic.
 c4goldsw	(or so I think)
@wiking	c4goldsw: hehe cool :)
 arianepaola	hello everyone :-)
 c4goldsw	wiking sorry to keep bother you, but I merged the main repo with my fork and it isn't compiling.  It fails at "Generating examples from meta-language (I couldn't think of any solutions).  Here's the output: https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/2b7d1597d13472f7dd3bd92b014ed6ea

 arianepaola	hi c4goldsw
@wiking	mmm good question
@wiking	lol
@wiking	try to remove the build directory
@wiking	and recompile
@wiking	btw
@wiking	install ccache if you dont have it yet
 c4goldsw	Does it just keep track of what bytecode has / hasn't changed?
 arianepaola	hi wiking

@wiking	c4goldsw: yep should
 c4goldsw	Sounds useful.  Let's hope rebuilding works lol.
 arianepaola	wiking: the PR for setup.py is squashed
@wiking	arianepaola: i'll try debugging now
@wiking	but if i cannot find it in the next 1-1.5 hours
@wiking	i'll just merge it
 arianepaola	ok, thanks
 c4goldsw	wiking still getting the same error after rebuilding from scratch - are there any issues on your end?
@wiking	noup :)
 c4goldsw	In that case, I'll dig around myself

-!- HeikoS1 [~heiko@82-132-215-139.dab.02.net] has joined #shogun
 OXPHOS	lambday: and actually the GPU vector is never changed. all the operations (now) return CPU type
@lambday	OXPHOS: umm not sure I fully understand
@lambday	OXPHOS: can you please elaborate a bit?
 OXPHOS	lambday: so GPUVec is just an add-on to the Vector once users call transfertoGPU. and transfertoGPU doesn't change CPUVector at all
 OXPHOS	So it won't happen that there's no CPUVector
@lambday	OXPHOS: no it doesn't change the cpu vector

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
@lambday	OXPHOS: oh so you wanted to understand why we need to transfer the gpu memory back to cpu ?
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Cookbook ecoc random
 OXPHOS	lambday: actually yeah
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@82-132-216-64.dab.02.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 HeikoS1	big improvement that was
@lambday	OXPHOS: so let's imagine this scenario: you transfer the memory to gpu..
@lambday	now you perform some operation on the vector in-place..
@lambday	as in, say, all the elements are squared.. or something like that
@lambday	since the data was on gpu, the gpubackend then changed the data on gpu as per the operation specifies it
@lambday	but it didn't touch cpu data at all
@lambday	so, at the end of all your calls, if you want to return your vector, then the content of the cpu memory is different (obsolete) than that of gpu mem array
@lambday	so if you don't copy the gpu memory to cpu then, the result is incorrect!
-!- HeikoS1 [~heiko@82-132-215-139.dab.02.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@lambday	because the user would expect that all he did in between should be reflected in the result, no?
@lambday	as in, in-place element-wise square, etc etc
@lambday	OXPHOS: am I making sense?
 OXPHOS	lambday: yes but i am thinking
 OXPHOS	only a few operations require in-place change
@lambday	OXPHOS: would it be safe to assume that?
 OXPHOS	should we just return the cpu type from the operation?
@lambday	OXPHOS: return from where?
 OXPHOS	lambday: I might have confused sth. - so say T dot()
 OXPHOS	the T is on GPU if ViennaCL is called? or doesn't matter
@lambday	OXPHOS: dot is easy.. dot returns a single scalar value..
@lambday	OXPHOS: what about element-wise square/sin/cos/log/exp/pow(N) ?
@lambday	I mean, in-place operations would be there sometimes I think
 OXPHOS	lambday: yeah u'r right..
@lambday	you don't want to create a new memory every-time you do a small operation.. sometimes it is better to be done in-place
@lambday	OXPHOS: say, you want to add two vectors, a and b, and want to store the result in a itself..
@lambday	this is another example
 OXPHOS	lambday: sure! and for the transfer to CPU - if onGPU=false, we throw SG_SINFO?
@lambday	so, in the end, when all is said and done, you transfer your gpu data to cpu and return that
@lambday	OXPHOS: yeah, should not be an error..
 OXPHOS	lambday: and the threadsafe, should it be sth. like mutex? how sure how to accomplish that?
@lambday	OXPHOS: yeah something like mutex or atomic or so.. just wanted that you thought about this a bit
@lambday	OXPHOS: doesn't have to be in this patch.. but maybe in next patch you can add that
 OXPHOS	lambday: cool thx!
@lambday	OXPHOS: issues like, say, two threads want to transfer the data to gpu.. and such and such
 OXPHOS	I see

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: lets discuss next steps
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I have a little side thing:
 Saurabh7	HeikoS:  yes ofc :0
 Saurabh7	:)
@HeikoS	so xvalidation
@HeikoS	we have that parfor thing
@HeikoS	what happens if I use parfor in an algorithm?
@HeikoS	what happens?
@HeikoS	how is speed affected?
 Saurabh7	hmm
 Saurabh7	I need to check , havent run any parallel algo yet
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	might be a nice little side thing
@HeikoS	I think first step is to read up on this case
@HeikoS	lambday seemed to remember that doing this is actually strongly discouraged
@HeikoS	so we need to protect ourselves against that
@HeikoS	apart from that, what algo do you wanna do next?
 Saurabh7	really, must look into then
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: I had a look at KNN and CART
 Saurabh7	CART is really huge,
@HeikoS	KNN has something in it already hasnt it=
@HeikoS	I know
 arianepaola	HeikoS would it be possible to add the content from the wiki, containing the description to http://readme.md/?
@HeikoS	we will do both anyways
@HeikoS	arianepaola: yes, actually the readme.md should contain the description from the wiki
@HeikoS	I did that a while ago but it got reverted by an accident I think
@HeikoS	feel free to send a patch
 arianepaola	ok
@HeikoS	arianepaola: how is the setup.py going?
@HeikoS	almost done?
 arianepaola	yes
 arianepaola	wiking will be merging it
@HeikoS	arianepaola: cool
@HeikoS	arianepaola: whats the next steps from there?
 arianepaola	the debian package
@HeikoS	arianepaola: btw, also ping me here if you updated the cookbooks or need help
@HeikoS	arianepaola: ah yes cool..
@HeikoS	arianepaola: and I guess some testing of the setup.py on our buildbot?
 arianepaola	yes
@HeikoS	arianepaola: ok, looking good
@HeikoS	keep on pushing it :)
 arianepaola	:-)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: then I will be profiling CART now, since its very cluttered , I can then find something to begin with

@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yeah profile it, and benchmark it
@HeikoS	use datasets with different N, D, and number of relevant features
@HeikoS	a bit like lasso, but the irrelevant features just contain noise
@HeikoS	and not sparse
 Saurabh7	ok cool
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: hoi
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: can you give me a brief update ?
-!- GandalfTheWizard [~Eva@112.10.170.90] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure. I refactored (again) the Linalg Vector class by merging CPU/GPU vector into one vector class and added memory align
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: also started two cookbooks - sharedboost and relaxed tree
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: cool
@HeikoS	was mostly after the linalg
 OXPHOS	yep
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and next steps for the linalgVector are?
 OXPHOS	transfer data from GPU back to CPU - add test case - (maybe merge Vector to SGVector) - modify linalg class to be compatible with new Vector class
 OXPHOS	HeikoS ^
@HeikoS	ok coo
@HeikoS	I discussed a bit with lambday, I think SGVector should not be merged with linalgVector
@HeikoS	but wiking is of different opinion, I dont know how strong though
@HeikoS	but I guess transferring is first
@HeikoS	cool
