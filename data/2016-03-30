@wiking	HeikoS: yo! how about we create a user matrix?
@HeikoS	wiking: jojo
@HeikoS	wiking: in the sense of what?
@HeikoS	academic/business/OS/etc?
@wiking	i've just added another sheet
@wiking	to that spreadsheet
@HeikoS	checking
@wiking	applicants/shogun-mentors
@wiking	matrix
@wiking	so that we can just +/- the whole thing
@wiking	or rate between 1-5
@HeikoS	ah yes
@HeikoS	definitely
@HeikoS	good idea
@HeikoS	very good idea
@HeikoS	lets rate 1-5
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	rate between 1-5 (1 unaccaptable to 5 very good)
@wiking	good?
@HeikoS	yep
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	fuck i wanna comment on things
@wiking	but i suppose we wanna keep everything in one spreadsheet no?
@HeikoS	yes
