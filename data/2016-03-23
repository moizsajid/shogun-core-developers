 c4goldsw	Hey guys, I'm Chris!  How's everyone doing?
 c4goldsw	I just have a few questions in regards to GSoC.  The project that catches my eye the most is the linalg cleanup: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_project_linalg

 c4goldsw	I'm just finishing off a math specialist course for linear algebra, and this would be a great way to spend the summer practicing and implementing what I've learnt.  From what I've noticed, it isn't one of the main priorities, but how important is it?
