@sonney2k	foulwall, please connect the dots with a line of same size as dots
@sonney2k	foulwall, otherwise very neat!
 foulwall	ok, I'll finish the ocr today.
@sonney2k	foulwall, could you please send me a quick patch that increases the size of the dots in the binary classifier etc input?
@sonney2k	foulwall, I intend to show your demo at the workshop tomorrow

 foulwall	still not big?
@sonney2k	let me try another browser
@sonney2k	no not big enough
 foulwall	ok I'll make it even bigger
@sonney2k	maybe you could have some settings.js file defining constants that one can tune
@sonney2k	e.g. line widths, dot radius, dot color etc
 foulwall	ok, I'll do it later
@sonney2k	for now just make it 2-3 times as large
 foulwall	http://foulwall.com:8000/svr/entrance how about this size?
 foulwall	sonney2k: ?
@sonney2k	foulwall, done?

@iglesiasg	pickle27: did you manage to build for R btw?
 pickle27	not yet
 pickle27	iglesiasg: do you know how I can cast in octave?
 pickle27	instructions online are only for built in types
@iglesiasg	pickle27: let me check
@iglesiasg	pickle27: have you taken a look to python examples, maybe there is something similar?
@iglesiasg	pickle27: we're interesting in casting Features to RealFeatures right?
 pickle27	Im am porting my own python example
 pickle27	yeah
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@85.26.232.220] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	pickle27: all right, so do you see obtain_from_generic in CMatrixFeatures and CLatentFeatures?
 pickle27	I don't actually
-!- zxtx [~zv@rrcs-76-79-81-162.west.biz.rr.com] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	pickle27: hehe wait a second
 pickle27	Latent has it
@iglesiasg	maybe I am telling you sth wrong
@iglesiasg	pickle27: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/features/MatrixFeatures.h#L136
@iglesiasg	Matrix features too
@iglesiasg	anyway
 pickle27	kk its not in doxygen yet
@iglesiasg	pickle27: aaah oh sorry then
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I never check doxygen, but the code
 pickle27	true
@iglesiasg	pickle27: so I think you need that sort of method but in CDenseFeatures
 pickle27	probably a good idea
 pickle27	yeah I guess so, I wasn't planning on having to do framework mods for this lol
@iglesiasg	pickle27: providing we're developers of Shogun yeah, but doc should be updated too. It is what users will want to use
 pickle27	but you're right thats what I need
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I am wondering now
@iglesiasg	pickle27: it is missing just because someone didn't need to do that before (which I find odd)
@iglesiasg	pickle27: or because there is another way to do it
 pickle27	in C++ you can just Cast directly its just in octave that it seems like there is no way to do this
 pickle27	see there is an obtain from dot in DenseFeatures
@iglesiasg	pickle27: where?
 pickle27	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/features/DenseFeatures.h
 pickle27	line 276
@iglesiasg	pickle27: aham! but that is actually doing much stuff
@iglesiasg	pickle27: like copying memory and everything
 pickle27	hmmm
@iglesiasg	pickle27: isn't it?
 pickle27	yeah
 pickle27	looks like it
@iglesiasg	pickle27: what you need is actually simpler, I think
 pickle27	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/libshogun/converter_jade_bss.cpp
 pickle27	this is my cpp example
 pickle27	I just cast the pointer
 pickle27	line 88
 pickle27	and here is python
 pickle27	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/converter_jade_bss.py
 pickle27	line 41, didn't have to do anything
@iglesiasg	pickle27: but you are getting trouble in octave_modular trying to do the same thing?
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@85.26.232.220] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 pickle27	yeah because I can't cast my CFeatures to CDenseFeatures in order to call get_feature_matrix
@iglesiasg	pickle27: what I mean is that in python you didn't have that problem but you do in octave?
 pickle27	yeah
@iglesiasg	pickle27: or is it in both because you cannot cast as in C++?
 pickle27	in Octave I get "error member not found"
 pickle27	python works great
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I guess this is because there is some SWIG code that fixes this for python, but it doesn't for the other interfaces
 pickle27	maybe
 pickle27	its because of python is typed
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I am not sure actually why it works in Python but not in octave
@iglesiasg	pickle27: what?
 pickle27	octave can't see that the object is really a densefeatures obj because the pointer is the generic one
 pickle27	python can see that
 pickle27	meh I just figured a way to side step this for now
@iglesiasg	pickle27: hehe ok
@iglesiasg	pickle27: did you read that thing that it works with python but not with octave because the first one is typed and not the other?
 pickle27	no just kind of a gut instinct from what I know about python and how Im seeing the swig wrapper working with octave
 pickle27	alsp
 pickle27	any idea why my R_modular is crashing?
@iglesiasg	not at all

 pickle27	I'll start a build and log it
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 lambday	HeikoS: the workshop is tomorrow right?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: how can I run my build with >> lot.txt and still have it show in the shell
@iglesiasg	pickle27: you can open that file with another command
@iglesiasg	from the command line I mean
@iglesiasg	pickle27: check tee
 pickle27	ty
@iglesiasg	pickle27: I just did a stupid test with: ls | tee test

 pickle27	maybe this will help see why R doesn't build
