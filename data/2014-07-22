@wiking	HeikoS: here?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@wiking	HeikoS: ok so we have the last remaining error with the libshogun tests
@wiking	modelselection_combined_kernel_sub_parameters
@wiking	shouldn't the features be wrapped into a CombinedFeatures?
@wiking	as currently this way we are having some nice assert error
@HeikoS	wiking: this error is new
@HeikoS	wiking: wasnt happening last week
@HeikoS	wiking: lisitsyn changed some things in this due to the mkl bug we had
@HeikoS	with locked features
@HeikoS	wiking: or is there something else going on?
@wiking	21952 sonne     20   0 16.4g 8.9g   88 D   4.0 37.8 374:47.54 python
@wiking	web demos are really fucked btw
@wiking	that is actual ram consumption of a demo
@wiking	9 fucking gigs
@wiking	HeikoS: no that was like this before lisitsyn's change...
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah i know
@HeikoS	wiking: so bad, since i will present things on thursday
@HeikoS	wiking: would be good if things were working (at least more or less)
@HeikoS	wiking: in particular the cloud
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, maybe remove the example for now, i will change that, but currently have no time to look into it
@HeikoS	wiking: could you fire up an issue for me?
@wiking	HeikoS: no diy
@wiking	cloud is there
@wiking	that's working
@wiking	and not DoS-ing the fatbot at least
@HeikoS	wiking: ok cool, which version
@wiking	the one that has been there eever since
@wiking	i cannot update it unless one of those 2 guys give me the scripts
@HeikoS	wiking: ask again ? :
@HeikoS	:D
@HeikoS	since the new notebooks are out of synch with the old version from back then
@wiking	HeikoS: it could be like the 20th time
@HeikoS	wiking: haha, just sent another one

@wiking	besser82: do u know a good way to tunnel ipv4 in ipv6?
@besser82	wiking, two possible ways...
@besser82	either use an AFTR-Server or do DNS64...
@besser82	wiking, ^^ NAT64 i mean...
@besser82	wiking, on Linux / BSD machines you can do easy setup of this using "TAYGA", "Ecdysis" or "Jool"...

@wiking	everything is green
@wiking	may it stay like this from now on again for a while
@wiking	HeikoS: and btw we have a new osx bot ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome :)
@HeikoS	wiking: well done :)
@wiking	which will show us right away that swig 3+ + shogun is not working atm
@HeikoS	wiking: wow where does the bot come from? i talked to gunnar who also wanted to donate one
@wiking	HeikoS: he can still donate one :)
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@HeikoS	wiking: i will set this up
@HeikoS	wiking: so far nothing from the sponsor people, i guess they need some time to discuss internally
@wiking	HeikoS: that one is simply a VM
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah ... well one day :)
@wiking	let's see if somebody introduced memleak ever since 10th of july :P
@wiking	btw HeikoS who wrote these
@wiking	 91 - unit-BAHSIC (Failed)
@wiking	 95 - unit-PCA (Failed)
