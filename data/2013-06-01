@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no there is one but you can submit as often as you want. the most recent one is the one that counts
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: ah ok, I understand
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: btw I checked out dates of my first submission of edrt (now tapkee)
 lisitsyn	I sent it on 31 Jan
 lisitsyn	and got answer on 21 Mar
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: so we will waiiit a loot
@iglesiasg	yeah... I expected about two months too
 lisitsyn	it was a bit less actually
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: hey there
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hello
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what's up with your writing stuff? ready? ;)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: from my part very little left, I will be done by the end of today!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: that's cool
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what's next?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: get my PR merged first :D
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: how is it going?
@iglesiasg	then I am going to have a closer look to the metric learning implementation and I will probably try to talk to you about it
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I have seen that the matlab dimensionality reduction includes LMNN
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: and Georg wondered if it actually could make sense that the LMNN was included in shogun as part of tapkee
@iglesiasg	he is actually keen on that idea so that it is easier to use LMNN (fewer dependencies, etc)
 lisitsyn	hah
 lisitsyn	I see
@iglesiasg	but it was a very preliminary discussion, we have to think of it more carefully
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I am still playing with proposed algorithm (I am just curious whether it will produce at least something sensible). If it won't - I am interested in trying to implement NN's for shogun (if main contributors won't mind)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: no nobody minds NNs - we are just too stupid
 lisitsyn	err I mean we don't know NNs very well ;)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: :D
@iglesiasg	nobody knows NNs very well, they just work but we don't understand why :P
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no, that's not true
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: a few guys know them
 lisitsyn	like le cun, hinton and ng
 lisitsyn	hah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: well, but at least people don't understand them as linear models can be understood
@iglesiasg	I got that feeling at least
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes sure
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess, Rosenblatt did also knew something about NN's)
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: well that was all pretty simple
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: you mean linear perceptron?
 lisitsyn	they did some steps for better understanding what happens here
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: yeah linear perceptron is just a linear classifier
 lisitsyn	IIRC he proposed something with more layers but he didn't know how to train them
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: actually, I've read that people just did not understood what he did proposed
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: if you are talking about some posts on habrahabr
 lisitsyn	by some guy with nickname 'tac'
 lisitsyn	I believe he is totally mad and in medical sense
@iglesiasg	hahaha
@iglesiasg	no offense though
 lisitsyn	no he is totally totally mad
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: maybe:)
 lisitsyn	he doesn't get a thing but keep writing some shit he has no idea about
 lisitsyn	too many times he was into shameful (for him) discussions
@iglesiasg	is habrahabr a Rusian blog about sth?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes like reddit
 lisitsyn	vgorbati: I'd recommend you to read that http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5:%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%81_%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC
 lisitsyn	here this ill guy argues with one of the top russian machine learners about machine learning

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw if you want to do something tapkee like I don't mind but inside tapkee does IMHO not make sense
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: do you think it does not make sense because metric learning is not dim reduction or another reason?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes.
@sonney2k	I mean tapkee == dim red
@sonney2k	if you make it bigger than that you at some point arrive at shogun
@iglesiasg	yes, I agree with you
@iglesiasg	the idea arose because it seems that Georg likes the idea of having something standalone and then I found out that LMNN is included in the matlab toolbox for dim red
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: but something tapkee like sounds like a good idea as well
@iglesiasg	in any case I will think first how it should fit into shogun
@iglesiasg	if we would need something new, say a metric directory, or it would make sense as part of distance
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: I plan to consult once I have thought of it more
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah georg never used shogun nor particularly liked it
@sonney2k	well he used it but when he found it useful
@sonney2k	but when there was an issue he always did his own..
@sonney2k	and never reported bugs or so
@sonney2k	that is why the matlab structured output code exists
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: maybe he has changed his mind a bit then since he is mentor now
