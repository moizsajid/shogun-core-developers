tushar	Hi, I want to know how does shogun is better than tensorflow and in which terms?	15:09
tushar	Since I want to contribute to anyone of them to getting started in machine learning	15:11
tushar	so in that way how shogun is better?	15:11
@wiking	:)	15:13
@wiking	tushar, hi and welcome!	15:13
@wiking	tushar, well tensorflow is a neural network sw, while shogun is more specialized in other machine learning models	15:14
@wiking	tushar, but on the other hand these information you can figure out by googling and reading documentation as well...	15:15
tushar	great, but does shogun also include neural networks?	15:15
tushar	ok, so In general I think shogun is great to start, however I'm graduated, so I can't participate in GSOC 2017 for contribution in shogun, so could you please help me to getting started.	15:18
tushar	However I know basic C++	15:24
tushar	Ok guys got it everything related to it on your site.	15:33
