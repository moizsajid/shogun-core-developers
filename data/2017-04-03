 tushar	Hi, I want to know how does shogun is better than tensorflow and in which terms?
 tushar	Since I want to contribute to anyone of them to getting started in machine learning
 tushar	so in that way how shogun is better?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	tushar, hi and welcome!
@wiking	tushar, well tensorflow is a neural network sw, while shogun is more specialized in other machine learning models
@wiking	tushar, but on the other hand these information you can figure out by googling and reading documentation as well...
 tushar	great, but does shogun also include neural networks?
 tushar	ok, so In general I think shogun is great to start, however I'm graduated, so I can't participate in GSOC 2017 for contribution in shogun, so could you please help me to getting started.
 tushar	However I know basic C++
 tushar	Ok guys got it everything related to it on your site.
