@wiking	ok
@wiking	sorry
@wiking	guys
@wiking	who ever are the core developers
@wiking	i'm shutting down your
@wiking	ipython sessions
@wiking	currently one cannot create new ones
@wiking	as we ran out of memory
@wiking	besser82: do something ;)
@wiking	no more resources on fatbot
 besser82	wiking: on it  ;)
 besser82	wiking: puiterwijk has taken nirik WIP, currently....
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.106.92] has joined #shogun
 sonne|osx	hey goat moaning!
@wiking	besser82: r u using your container?
 sonne|osx	wiking: no
 sonne|osx	woopsi
 sonne|osx	not enough memory to ..
@wiking	yeah...
 sonne|osx	Sorry, not enough free memory to start your container
@wiking	trying to fix some stuff
 besser82	wiking: currently not... u can purge it safely...
 sonne|osx	wiking: well
 sonne|osx	$ ps auxw | grep ipython | wc -l
 sonne|osx	83
 sonne|osx	no wonder...
 sonne|osx	poor fatbot
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.106.92] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@wiking	we need to find out a way to stop container ... :S
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.106.92] has joined #shogun
 sonne|osx	$ ps auxw | grep ipython | wc -l
 sonne|osx	83
 sonne|osx	wiking: btw what does the the number of users in github mean?
@wiking	?
@wiking	where what?
 sonne|osx	on fatbot
 sonne|osx	$ ps auxw | grep ipython | wc -l
 sonne|osx	83
 sonne|osx	wiking: and on github
 sonne|osx	applications
 sonne|osx	it says 9 users
@wiking	aaah
 sonne|osx	is that in total 9 people logged in or currently
@wiking	that 9 users has registered to cloud via github
@wiking	total
 sonne|osx	wiking: we don't know how many via g+ right?
 sonne|osx	wiking: or do we have any kind of stats for cloud.*
@wiking	sonne|osx: lemme check
@wiking	there should be something about g+ as well
@wiking	but i can tell u how many registered users there are all together atm
 sonne|osx	wiking: and?
@wiking	just a sec
@wiking	31
 sonne|osx	woah
 sonne|osx	no wonder then
@wiking	but i dont know how to handle timeouts
@wiking	as basically the whole interaction is in a different session (ipython)
 sonne|osx	wiking: so we have tons of dead clients?
@wiking	sonne|osx: well we just have some containers that i dont know whether active or not
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.106.92] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@wiking	besser82: do you still have the container running?
@wiking	besser82: as in worst case what we can do is to mount up an nfs
@wiking	besser82: container = fedora cloud instance
@wiking	besser82: btw what was the amount of ram in it?
 sonne|work	wiking: how does now shut down a container then?
 besser82	wiking: I don't have the container running
 besser82	wiking: 8 GB afaik
 besser82	wiking: but I can request another 8GB if needed
 besser82	wiking: I actually can request non-persistant storage in insane amounts as well
@wiking	sonne|work: well now i've added the logout button to request a docker container shutdown
@wiking	sonne|work: but i dont believe people will push that button so often
@wiking	;)
@wiking	besser82: is it running now?
 besser82	wiking: no, i'm logged in but it is not running
 sonne|work	wiking: what does this mean - will it erase everything I did then?
@wiking	sonne|work: noup
@wiking	sonne|work: it's just shuts down the container
 sonne|work	wiking: cool
@wiking	sonne|work: but it still exists...
@wiking	so whenever u log back in
@wiking	everything will be there as u left it
@wiking	besser82: what does it mean not running?
 sonne|work	wiking: could we then `just' monitor if a client has 0 load for ~1hr or sth and then shut it down?
@wiking	besser82: see u logged in again... if u dont use it plz logout as we really need the resources
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah that's what i was wondering about as well
@wiking	sonne|work: couldn't find yet a definitive solution for it
@wiking	but trying
 besser82	wiking: allright I will / not-running means: cluster tab shows "stopped"
@wiking	besser82: hence we cannot connect to it now?
@wiking	right?
 besser82	wiking: ???
@wiking	besser82: to the fedora instance
 sonne|work	wiking: or we put some time limit on every instance now forcing these shutdowns
@wiking	sonne|work: i guess from the cgroup stats we can find out a lot of thing... and create a heuristic to shutdown the container
 besser82	actually you can, but there's nothing but some 1.5 gbytes free hdd and 8GB ram
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean just put a limit of 1 hour for now
@wiking	besser82: nfs?
@wiking	sonne|work: i think that should be feasible with cgroups
 besser82	wiking: there's nothing but some 1.5 gbytes free hdd and 8GB ram
@wiking	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cgroups
 besser82	wiking: so you need some nfsclient, right?
@wiking	besser82: yep
@wiking	sonne|work: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/cgroups
 besser82	wiking: let me setup
@wiking	sonne|work: let's try to find a rule
 sonne|work	wiking: even ulimit /limits.conf has a time limit
 besser82	wiking: will be avail ~10:00 UTC
 sonne|work	hmmhh actually cpu time limit
@wiking	sonne|work: docker uses cgroups
 sonne|work	don't see wall time
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah but it says more flexible than limits.conf stuff
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah you can limit like everything
 sonne|work	cpu.rt_runtime_us
@wiking	sonne|work: it's more finegrained than ulimit
 sonne|work	nah sth else :/
@wiking	sonne|work: ID                  IMAGE                            COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS
@wiking	b0ed635c7a09        vigsterkr/shogun-python:latest   /bin/sh -c ipython n   43 minutes ago      Up 43 minutes       49244->8888
@wiking	this is a docker statistics
@wiking	so we can get information about when it was created
@wiking	and when it was last time started
@wiking	so it would be quite easy to do some kind of a scheduler that check STATUS
@wiking	and shuts down everything that is longer than 60 minutes
 sonne|work	good enough then
@wiking	ok i'll then add this garbage collector to the app
@wiking	and add a note line about this hard limit to the cloud site
 sonne|work	I guess we can later add some .js & knob on the website to ask for another 60 mins
@wiking	sonne|work: yeps.... i'll just check if i can do this whole thing within the webapp
@wiking	sonne|work: i dont know if it's possible there somehow to do a loop or something :P
@wiking	sonne|work: so should i shutdown containers now that are running longer than 60 mins?
 sonne|work	yes
@wiking	done
 sonne|work	wiking: did any remain?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	3
 sonne|work	heh
 sonne|work	I guess we had 30 people trying it out -> then out of memory
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	sonne|work: should i add a counter there? :D
@wiking	sonne|work: ok maybe it's even easier
 sonne|work	wiking: nah
@wiking	sonne|work: i add a simple js there that counts down
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	yeah it's not the best if one closes the tab :P
 sonne|work	wiking: can't you extract the time the thing runs and display it?
@wiking	sonne|work: yes but if one closes a tab...?
 sonne|work	wiking: would be nice if the container shuts down immediately then

@iglesiasg	morning
 sonne|work	moing iglesiasg
@wiking	besser82: nfs?
@wiking	sonne|work: would it b safe just to have an url like http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/purge
@wiking	which if called would stop all the timeouted containers?
@wiking	of course this way everybody could call this function ... but then again we dont really care as the it would only stop containers that run out of time
@wiking	so i dont really see a big security issue there
@wiking	and then i just crontab a curl command for every 30 mins...
 sonne|work	wiking: I would do this using a cron job locally
 sonne|work	wiking: and rather use this mechanism to display the runtime in minutes of the current container!
@wiking	?
@wiking	"10:27 < sonne|work> wiking: and rather use this mechanism to display the runtime in minutes of the current container!" what?
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean when you can do sth like /purge
 sonne|work	wiking: you can do a /minutes-available url just returning some digits
@wiking	sonne|work: of the current session?
 sonne|work	wiking: we can then use .js to display this
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
@wiking	sonne|work: ok but that still does not solve the whole thing...
@wiking	sonne|work: as we are not only monitoring the current sessions
@wiking	but all of them
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't understand what you mean - I thought there is just one session per user?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	but i want to monitor all the sessions
@wiking	and do the purging at once
 sonne|work	wiking: sure but that you you can do locally in some shell script
@wiking	sonne|work: but i dont want to do that in a shell script
 sonne|work	wiking: the other thing is just some potentially valuable notification for the user
@wiking	as it's hacky
 sonne|work	wiking: why not?
 sonne|work	you mean url is not?
@wiking	because it's much easier to do within the webapp
@wiking	to do the purging
 sonne|work	wiking: pretty weird - I guess you can run the /purge thing only locally - I mean just don't expose this to the outside
@wiking	anybody know
@wiking	how to convert this into seconds with python
@wiking	2013-10-30T10:41:47.265306601+01:00
@wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: strptime()
@wiking	mmm i think this is a standard ISO format
@wiking	i hoped that there's a ctor for this :P
 sonne|work	wiking: doesnt' look ISO but rather java like
@wiking	ISO 8601
@wiking	Return a string representing the date and time in ISO 8601 format, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm
@wiking	including timezone
 sonne|work	wiking: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/969285/how-do-i-translate-a-iso-8601-datetime-string-into-a-python-datetime-object#969324
 sonne|work	datetime.datetime.strptime( "2007-03-04T21:08:12", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" )
 sonne|work	import dateutil.parser
 sonne|work	yourdate = dateutil.parser.parse(datestring)
 sonne|work	wiking: the last one seems good for you
@wiking	sonne|work: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/seconds-available
@wiking	done
 thoralf	sonne|work, wiking: I tried to log into the shogun cloud service, but github tells me it wants 7 different rights.
 thoralf	Are all of them neccessary?
@wiking	thoralf: tried to change the scope
@wiking	thoralf: but there's no such
@wiking	http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes
@wiking	sonne|work:                 Due to high demand and low available resources we had to introduce a time limit per session to 60 minutes.<br/>
@wiking	                If you would like to have more time please don't hesistate to contact us!<br/>
@wiking	                Thank you for your understanding
 thoralf	wiking: I see.  Thank you.
@wiking	ok?
@wiking	ok
 sonne|work	wiking: excellent so now we just need some way to embed this into the website
@wiking	yeah well some js hacker should do that ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: yes cool! YOu could add
@wiking	i'm just writing an email as well
 sonne|work	wiking: no problem with jquery
 sonne|work	but no idea how to do load some extra .js in the ipython notebooks
@wiking	sonne|work:
@wiking	update for the cloud:
@wiking	"Due to high demand and low available resources we had to introduce a time limit of 60 minutes per session."
@wiking	we are currently trying to find ways to extend our service. we basically do not have enough resources of our own to serve this level of demand, hence if you could help us out with more CPU/MEMORY, please contact us!
@wiking	cheers,
@wiking	viktor
@wiking	sonne|work: can this go on the mailing list?
 sonne|work	sure
 sonne|work	wiking: you could add in the description: Note that simply restarting your session will give you extra 60 minutes with you continuing where you left. All your work is saved.
@wiking	yeh indeed
@iglesiasg	wiking, hey! So did Shogun cloud get many users?
@wiking	iglesiasg: well it's getting fair amount
@wiking	it's not like ddos
@wiking	but we had to introduce some limits already
@iglesiasg	yeah, I just checked the timer thingy
@iglesiasg	but it is cool that people are using, breat
@iglesiasg	great*
@wiking	heheh yeah if u dont use it
@wiking	plz log out ;)
@wiking	that'll give us an extra slot ;P
@iglesiasg	haha yeah sure
@wiking	we can serve like 15 slots at once
@iglesiasg	I always log out ;)
@iglesiasg	going to check just in case..
@iglesiasg	yep, logged out indeed
@wiking	cool thxn
 sonne|work	wiking: I thought ddos was not possible because of out of memory messages right?
@wiking	sonne|work: well the app container can still be ddos-ed
@wiking	;)
@wiking	but from my point
@wiking	nobody actually running anything in the cloud ;P
@wiking	they just log in
@wiking	and then that's it
@wiking	besser82: ping
@wiking	hehhe there's only one active session now after the crontab
 besser82	wiking: pong!
 besser82	wiking: i'm on das nfs-thing...
@wiking	besser82: u can just readd my public key
@wiking	and i can do it
 besser82	wiking: will do in 5 minutes
 besser82	wiking: pub-key
 besser82	wiking: but i got disrupted by some customer who wanted me to take his $$$  ;)
@wiking	64 bytes from 209.132.184.157: icmp_req=9 ttl=49 time=136 ms
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	that nfs will be interesting :P
@wiking	but it's worth a shot
 besser82	wiking: looks like it will have some lag...
 besser82	wiking: you should be able to log in within the next 30 sec.
 besser82	wiking: rsa-key added
 besser82	wiking: fedora-ca is up and running again
@wiking	k
@wiking	thnx
@wiking	ok now i need to find a way to do this
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah sure that is all I would do too :)
 sonne|work	and then at some point I would come back...

 sonne|work	hey HeikoS
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I didn't manage to do this full gsoc blog yet
@HeikoS	hi
@HeikoS	sonne|work: dont worry, at least we have something now
 sonne|work	I blogged however about the cloud on twitter & g+ & my blog
 sonne|work	and then about the release
@HeikoS	thats good
@HeikoS	its good to do things in waves I guess
 sonne|work	so > 100k people should have seen it
 sonne|work	well we don't do things properly marketing wise
 sonne|work	we should do it snowden way
 sonne|work	I mean one big bummer
@HeikoS	hehe
 sonne|work	and then updates all the time
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: could you please make the videos the default when you click on events?
@iglesiasg	let me try
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, test it plase
@iglesiasg	please or whatever :D
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: haha
 sonne|work	excellent
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, nice post!
@wiking	heheh no active docker container
@wiking	we killed them all
@wiking	:DDD
 sonne|work	wiking: can we put things further - I mean I have this 'open in new window' thing
 sonne|work	wiking: could we add run interactively in the cloud?
@wiking	meaning?
 sonne|work	wiking: and this would then open this particular notebook in the cloud?
@wiking	sonne|work: you mean via the website?
@wiking	so like
 sonne|work	wiking: yes when you click on an example in the gallery
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	good luck creating it
@wiking	:)
 sonne|work	it says open a new window
@wiking	sorry but that's just insane amount of work
 sonne|work	errm why that?
@HeikoS	guys, btw its sooo cool to show people shogun on my phone/tablet
@HeikoS	while having coffee
 sonne|work	all it needs is to know which notebook to open
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so you want to fire up a new container after authing + open within ipython that give ipynb
 sonne|work	exactly
@wiking	the first part is more or less done
@wiking	but how the fuck do you do opening the notebook
 sonne|work	no idea how to tell ipython open that particular notebook
@wiking	within that given ipython session
@wiking	so
@wiking	tehre you go
@wiking	that's why it's not easy
@iglesiasg	I am afraid that the link to Tapkee's demo is broken
@iglesiasg	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo/
@iglesiasg	last one in the list
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: could you please fix it
 sonne|work	ahh no you cannot :/
 sonne|work	it just needs a data checkout / link on fatbot
 sonne|work	wiking: well we can start with the poor mans solution - it gives you the file open thing from ipython
@wiking	glhf
@wiking	aintnotime sorry
@wiking	:(
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I downloaded the words.dat file in 7nn
@iglesiasg	and put it into shogun-demo/static/data/tapkee
@iglesiasg	but didn't work out
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: IIRC data should be in root folder

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, lisitsyn do you have a sec?
@sonney2k	could you go to http://demos.shogun-toolbox.org/clustering/kmeans/
@sonney2k	and then to toy data
@sonney2k	and click dump at the bottom?
@sonney2k	or thoralf or lisitsyn1 or whoever is awake
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: yes let me
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, hurray
@sonney2k	I fixed toy data loading
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: yes worked here
@sonney2k	now if we had some coool data sets we could actually do cool stuff
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, then cluster with say 50 clusters
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: I am a bit confused with 'dump' naming
@sonney2k	or 100 if you want :)
 lisitsyn1	dump is something 'out', right?
