 lambday	HeikoS: hi! checking your and Dino's mail
@HeikoS	lambday: the build is broken, mmd integration tests fail
@HeikoS	could you fix that first
@HeikoS	?
 lambday	HeikoS: mmd integration tests fail?
 lambday	HeikoS: let me check
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah check travis
 shogun-buildbot	build #3030 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/3030  blamelist: Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>
 lambday	HeikoS: I guess this is caused because the updated implementation is in feature/mmd branch - so new data works fine with that! but its not merged with develop - so in develop this data is invalid!
 lambday	HeikoS: let me be double sure because in feature/mmd branch the build was successful!
@HeikoS	ok

@HeikoS	lambday: dont know :)
 lambday	HeikoS: umm this is bad! if what I think is the reason, then all future travis builds will fail unless feature/mmd is merged with develop - which we don't want now! I think I should manage to get deprecated implementation alongwith the new one instead - then its safe to merge with develop

@HeikoS	lambday: why not merge?
 lambday	HeikoS: because the older implementation is in develop - so in case we want to compare things, currently that's the only way!
 lambday	HeikoS: however, with the latest patch, I think we can accommodate deprecated implementation within it as well...
 lambday	which earlier was tough to do

 winterflower	cmake cannot find the correct version of swig. I have installed swig in /my/swig/path, but cmake keeps looking in /usr/bin which contains the wrong version of swig. I cannot remove it, because this is a school computer and the sys admin does not allow this
 winterflower	I have tried the following solutions: export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PATH:/my/swig/path
 winterflower	this did not solve the problem, but I got a different error message
 winterflower	before changing the CMAKE-PREFIX_PATH the error was   Could NOT find SWIG: Found unsuitable version "1.3.40", but required is at
 winterflower	  least "2.0.4" (found /usr/bin/swig)
 winterflower	and after changing the prefix path, the error is Could NOT find SWIG (missing: SWIG_DIR) (Required is at least version "2.0.4")
 winterflower	any suggestions? I have also tried running cmake with -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:/my/swig/path
 winterflower	but this did not help

@HeikoS	everyone can already prepare a brief update on their project, we will do that later
 abinash_panda	 hi all !
 kislay	hi everyone!
@HeikoS	anyone's student or mentor is missing?
@HeikoS	(apart from fernando and kevin?
@HeikoS	)
 kislay	HeikoS, pickle27 is here I think!
@lisitsyn	hah ;)
@HeikoS	let me check doodle :)
 pickle27	yeah I am here but I need to relocate and will be away for about 10 mins shortly
@HeikoS	brain is unreliable
@HeikoS	ok lets wait for 2 more mins and then start
@HeikoS	everyone ready?
@lisitsyn	yeah go on ;)
@HeikoS	(everyone sleeping?) :)
@HeikoS	Ok then
@HeikoS	Welcome to the pre-midterm meeting of our GSoC 2014.
@HeikoS	We are very happy how the projects are coming along and the how Shogun&rsquo;s code base (and quality) is increasing.
@HeikoS	We think all of you are doing an amazing job here!
@HeikoS	Mentors, thank you so much for investing your free time, students, keep on writing awesome code!
@HeikoS	This meeting is to synchronise everyone, share the fun. The schedule is
@HeikoS	1. to give some organisational updates
@HeikoS	2. to give an overview what everyone is doing
@HeikoS	3. and to remind you of the expectations at the end of GSoC.
@HeikoS	Let&rsquo;s keep things brief and effective so that we are done in 1hr max and can get our end-of-day beer :)
@HeikoS	Let's
@HeikoS	Comments?
 Theo__	middle of day beer in the USA ;)
@lisitsyn	yeah why not to start the day with beer :D
@HeikoS	Theo__: helps focussing ;)
-!- pickle27 [~pickle27@130.15.32.56] has quit [Quit: This computer has gone to sleep]
@lisitsyn	we lost him
@HeikoS	Ok if nobody has other points, lets start with
@HeikoS	1. Midterm Evaluation.
@HeikoS	This is possible from the 23rd and the hard (!) deadline is on the 27th.
@HeikoS	Both students and mentors have to fill in a short form on their work so far, takes only a few minutes.
@HeikoS	PLEASE do it on the 23rd immediately.
@HeikoS	As we are currently not aware of any problems with the projects, we expect all student/mentor pairs to pass this :)
@HeikoS	Students, your payment is depending on this, so push your mentors to do this ASAP.
@HeikoS	Mentors, please let us know if there are any problems.
@HeikoS	The midterm evaluation is also a point in time where you should re-visit and update your schedule depending on what you have done so far and what you expect to be able to do for the second half.
@HeikoS	 Please everyone spend some time on the planning component. In particular since the second half of the program usually runs much quicker and there is also more overhead due to deliverables at the end.
@HeikoS	Comments? Questions?
@lisitsyn	I want to emphasize that it is really just a few minutes :D
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	and very generic
@lisitsyn	not just small thing but really really small thing
@HeikoS	like how many hours did you spend, how was communication, etc
@lisitsyn	and why we ask to do that sooner
@HeikoS	you should take it as a motivation to see where you are in the schedule though, redefine goals, etc
@lisitsyn	is that we need to have some time to resolve any issues
@lisitsyn	(if occur)
@HeikoS	Ok then
@HeikoS	Next point
@HeikoS	2. Project updates.
@HeikoS	Please every group (both student AND mentor), give brief big-picture update on your project.
@HeikoS	What has been done? Where are you in the schedule, do you need to update it? What is your plan for the second half?
@HeikoS	It would be great if you could prepare your answers in a text editor now. If you have things to show, please include links.
@HeikoS	Who wants to start?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: want to start? ;)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, yeah
@HeikoS	please note that both mentor AND student should give a few sentences :)
 khalednasr	here's what I did so far:
 khalednasr	I started by implementing neural networks - this was during the application period for gsoc
 khalednasr	When gsoc started, I did some more work on neural nets framework, it used to support only simple chain structures for networks. I extended it to support general graph architectures
 khalednasr	Then I moved on to implementing convolutional neural nets and then I started working on restircted boltzmann machines
 khalednasr	I recently finished working on RBMs and am currently working on deep belief nets
@lisitsyn	yeah so now we have some of these fancy things called *deep learning*
@lisitsyn	:)
 khalednasr	Everything has been going according to schedule so far
@lisitsyn	khaled is totally on schedule
@HeikoS	khalednasr, lisitsyn cool sounds great
@lisitsyn	though we have some background task of GPUizing it
@HeikoS	yeah I was about to ask about this
@lisitsyn	but apart from that khalednasr is totally on schedule
@lisitsyn	with day precision
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	Theo__: might have some ideas to compare implementations against existing toolboxes in terms of speed?
 khalednasr	yeah I still want to work on that
@HeikoS	the linalg framework thing might help, we should discuss with lambday after the meeting
@HeikoS	and wiking
 khalednasr	Theo__, I'll look into that
 Theo__	Ok, let me say some things...
 Theo__	I was writing in a text editor
 Theo__	The deep learning project seems to be well on track, Khaled has been very diligent with updates and commits. The coding is doing fine and is generally of high quality, so I am very satisfied with that. Schedule-wise, I believe we could readjust slightly in a week. We had left a lot of potential things open for the second part of GSOC and I need to re-convene with Khaled to prioritize a couple. We do have a plan that will be fine if 
 Theo__	To make things clear, we have not done speed-tests. I have my doubts we can compete with some of the very engineered toolboxes at this point.
 Theo__	But I do not believe we should lose sleep over that too much if we are generically in the right regime speed-wise.
@lisitsyn	yeah for sure we won't be the fastest thing
@HeikoS	Theo__: maybe then this should be integrated into second half. We don't need to beat everyone on speed, but it maybe should be in the same order of magnitude?
@HeikoS	to make sure that nothing fundamental is wrong in the code?
@HeikoS	yeah
 Theo__	Khaled is doing a great job with unit tests
 Theo__	so nothing will be wrong
@lisitsyn	btw coding wise it is also great
@HeikoS	khalednasr, Theo__ we have a benchmark folder btw
 Theo__	but speed in these models is a tight thing
@lisitsyn	I don't think there is something fundamental that makes us to lose speed
@lisitsyn	but just GPU
@HeikoS	ok cool.
 Theo__	I am thinking we might cut some things from the schedule for the second half to make time for solving some standard tasks and give out numbers.
@lisitsyn	that's a major thing but needs additional work
 Theo__	This is part of rediscussing our goals.
 Theo__	for part 2
 khalednasr	Theo__, cool
 Theo__	Because if we want to do involved experiments Khaled will not be able to implement all the rest of the schedule.
 Theo__	So we will just discuss this and come up with a good compromise.
 Theo__	Does that seem reasonable?
@lisitsyn	absolutely
 khalednasr	yeah
@HeikoS	Theo__, lisitsyn I guess thats fine! Experiments and illustrations are more important actually in my eyes
@HeikoS	since its the interface to the outside world
 Theo__	I agree.
@HeikoS	ok then, sounds very nice, lets move on
@lisitsyn	oh that was a bit long ;)
@lisitsyn	gogo
@HeikoS	parijat: you want to be next?
@HeikoS	and then yorkerlin afterwards (please already prepare)
 parijat	ya sure
 parijat	So far I have worked on decision tree algorithms : CART, C4.5, CHAID. I also implemented Random Forests. All this is backed up with API examples and notebook. This week I am working on gradient boosting. As of now I am a running slightly less than a week late, by the end of gradient boosting I should be back on track easily (I left more time than needed for boosting actually). Fernando thinks and I agree that my planned schedule was
 parijat	replanned our second half.
 parijat	Our plan for second half is:
@wiking	parijat: worth to have a look (currently it's overhyped method on kaggle): https://github.com/tqchen/xgboost
@HeikoS	parijat: what about reproducing some of the std benchmark results of random forests in a notebook?
 parijat	wiking: thanks! I'll have a look
@lisitsyn	wiking: magic thing :D
 parijat	yes Random Forest notebook isn't done yet, I will do it this week
 parijat	if you have any specific datasets in mind please suggest
 parijat	:)
@HeikoS	parijat: cool, maybe even compare them to an SVM or something, I dont know what you have in mind
@HeikoS	parijat: there is this microsoft paper where all the std benchmarks are described, they are also used in the paper I sent you
@HeikoS	on mondrian forests
 parijat	HeikoS: yes sure, we can do that
@HeikoS	I think it would be good to have at least a few of those in
@HeikoS	since people know them
 parijat	ok I'll have a look at it
@HeikoS	and also compare things to scikit-learn both results and speed
@HeikoS	(we want to be faster here)
@HeikoS	(same results of course)
@HeikoS	 :
@HeikoS	:)
@wiking	parijat: this is a simple and informative test: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wfan/software.htm
 parijat	ya ok! sure
@wiking	(see the pictureS)
@wiking	parijat: rotational forest? do you have that in your schedule?
 parijat	yes indeed! We can put this in the RF notebook
@wiking	*rotation forest..
@HeikoS	wiking: so many forests out there ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: indeed
@HeikoS	parijat: ok nice! sounds good, please discuss your schedule with fernando then for second half. If nothing else, shall we move on?
 parijat	wiking: actually, I dropped it because other things took more time than planned
 parijat	wiking: if its important, I can fit it in place of something else
@wiking	parijat: but that's just putting there an extra PCA :P but nevermind quite easy to implement once one has a RandomForest implementation
@wiking	parijat: fernando should decide this
 parijat	wiking: oh! I didn't know
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: do you want to be next?
 yorkerlin	ok
 yorkerlin	Past I implemented three KL methods.  (my coding procedure: read paper-> wrote Matlab code -> wrote C++ code -> wrote unit tests)
@HeikoS	(Ill add my two cents afterwards)
 yorkerlin	Now I am working on the fourth KL method and some iPython notebook this week.
 parijat	wiking: if its that easy maybe I can fit in.. let me consult with Fernando
 yorkerlin	 Future Plan for second half After finishing the fourth KL method, I will work on multi-classification for GP. extend Laplace inference for multi-classification  (reference code:http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/ckiw/code/gpclass.tar.gz)  extend (2~4) of implemented KL methods for multi-classification (high priority: fast dual KL method and Choleskey KL method)  For Latent Gaussian model, I am not sure whether there is enough time to 
@wiking	parijat: alrighty
 yorkerlin	any comment?
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: The KL methods he has been doing are for GP inference, which is handy since it speeds things up and makes them more accurate
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: in general this will be useful for our GP collection
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: code is pretty involved, but all backed up by super tight unit tests
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: pretty good work. The notebook will reproduce results from the papers where the methods are described
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: schedule is fine
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: for second half, yes I guess mutlticlass should be the focus, the latent Gaussian model stuff might drop which is fine since it was optional
 yorkerlin	yeah
 Theo__	There is beautiful python code for a range of KL methods for GP's in the sheffield GP toolbox btw. Just in case this helps for one of the fancier methods.
@HeikoS	I will discuss with the other mentor in the particular methods for the second part
@HeikoS	Theo__: yeah they have pretty cool stuff.
 yorkerlin	I will take a look at it
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: we should definitely have a look at this, pyGP is the name
@HeikoS	wiking: the dual KL method btw is in place
 yorkerlin	good
@HeikoS	wiking: so works on large datasets
@HeikoS	ok, let's move one
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: we should chat later a bit
@wiking	HeikoS: oh gimme some references plz :)
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: could you send wiking one?
@HeikoS	lambday: are you there now?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes
 yorkerlin	It depends on inverse Kernel matrix.
@HeikoS	lambday: ok please go ahead then, maybe sejDino can add a few comments
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
 lambday	The main focus of our project is to implement a number of kernel-independence tests and kernel-two samples tests which finally leads to a framework for feature selection based on these measures for structured data which eventually leads to more sophisticated ML problems.
 lambday	While trying to implement one such measure, B-test, we found that in the original implementation some of the things have been done incorrectly. So we spent a major amount of first half of GSoC to correct these results both theoretically and implementation-wise (thanks to sejDino and HeikoS)
 lambday	While this was an interesting turn in terms of further research in this area, this changed our initial schedule of timeline in course (going through formulas, writing python code for validation).
 lambday	In the first half so far, we have finally implemented the correct measures for kernel two-sample testing based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for quadratic time, linear time and B-test and also have kept options for comparing these new theoretical results with the previous ones which may lead to a something new and exciting!
 lambday	We have also chalked out how feature selection algorithm should work in Shogun. We have been planning to make it in the most generic form possible which can be extended later fairly easily (could use your opinions on this wiking, lisitsyn).
 lambday	I am trying to finish one such feature selection algorithm based on backward elimination approach before mid-term.
 lambday	After mid-term, I plan to incorporate another approach, forward selection. Things that are kept for end-term would be then a three-variable interaction measure for kernel-independence test and a feature selection algorithm based on this. Also, I plan to finish coupla based kernel dependence measure within GSoC period.
@wiking	yorkerlin: plz can you send me some links pointers of what dual KL method is and how i can use it in shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: to translate this first part: lambday found bugs in our papers :D
 lambday	A few things in the original schedule might have to be postponed due to unpredicted delay as mentioned above.
-!- pickle27 [~AndChat79@24.114.98.113] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: and of course linalg
 sejDino	ok I can add what I wrote down now :)
@HeikoS	wiking, lambday, lisitsyn we should discuss this after the meeting, would love to get it merged
 pickle27	Hey guys sorry I'm late
@HeikoS	sejDino: pls do! :)
 sejDino	great progress so far on kernel testing project. lambday has done some excellent work on internals of the kernel testing classes in order to obtain large speedups. he implemented a block approach for two-sample tests and as lambday mentioned, he fixed some issues that existed in the previous approaches (discovering these issues is basically a part of a larger research-type effort, and might feature in one of the next papers on the topic). we have mapped out
 lambday	HeikoS: yes... however, that's not a part of my project though - but will be useful for Shogun in genrral
@HeikoS	lambday, sejDino lets update our schedule document soon with timeline to reflect the changes
@HeikoS	ok, who wants next?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ?
 lambday	HeikoS: sejDino: alright :)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok!
 Saurabh7	Hi all
 Saurabh7	My project is mainly about trying to make shogun more visible by coding up new ipython-notebooks and web-demos. I added some new notebooks inlcuding one about a general introduction to shogun briefly covering all parts (nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/Saurabh7/4880fc90381afd420bcf), one about various regression models in shogun along which I also added a web-demo (which now includes the famous boston housing data set), etc.
 Saurabh7	Next I plan to cover the not-yet documented stuff like model-selection with their nbs and add some more cool demos. I think I am slightly behind on my schedule so will try to speed up things in the second half :)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 has written some quite nice notebooks that will be very useful for Shogun in lots of ways
 yorkerlin	the fast dual paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1052
@HeikoS	Please everyone try to give some feedback on them
@HeikoS	We will merge the first versions soon
 Saurabh7	yes , new ideas are welcome, since you guys know more about shogun than me!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yeah we should hurry up a bit to keep up with the schedule - I am much more available from now on
 pickle27	That's awesome! Saurabh7 what do you think about making the demo app use flask instead of Django? This is something I might do for fun at some point
@HeikoS	Yeah everyone, if oyu have a nice idea for a demo/notebook, let us know
 pickle27	Wondering what your opinion on that is
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 will focus on the demos in the second half, so we can have lots of new ones. Please give us input on that
@HeikoS	khalednasr: like one of yours for example
 Saurabh7	pickle27, haven't had much experience with flask sorry
 Saurabh7	pickle27, but will have a look
@HeikoS	pickle27: that would be cool, but its not feasible for this project
@HeikoS	pickle27:  we are focussing on content rather than technical stuff, but I like the idea, maybe we can work on this later in the year?
 pickle27	Yeah not part of GSoC this is something I'll work on in my effort to clean up our Web facing code
@HeikoS	yeah good idea!
 pickle27	Cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I would love to see some of the regularization analysis I sent you in the notebooks on model-selection
@HeikoS	ok, lets move on!
@HeikoS	abinash_panda:  do you want to go ahead?
 abinash_panda	HeikoS: Okay.
 abinash_panda	My project is *Large Scale Multilabel Classification*.
 abinash_panda	Within first three weeks, I had implemented classes for representing multi-label labels for SO framework and then went on implementing MultilabelModel to allow multi-label learning. After, this in the past week I had to started to work on feature hashing in multi-label scenario. Currently, the PR#2320 is there for HashedMultilabelModel for feature hashing. This week I would be reproducing some notebooks for the standard benchmarks and comparisions w
@HeikoS	abinash_panda: nice, I would love to see examples of this stuff. Since I dont really know about it :d
@HeikoS	thoralf: you got comments?
@HeikoS	abinash_panda: how is the schedule going?
 abinash_panda	HeikoS: I have written an example in examples/undocumented/libshogun/so_multilabel.cpp for classification of yeast multilabel dataset
 abinash_panda	HeikoS: I think I am on schedule :)
@HeikoS	abinash_panda: ok cool! nice to hear!
 abinash_panda	by the end of this week I would be producing a notebook with more cool stuffs :)
@HeikoS	if thoralf is not around, I suggest we go on
 jiaolong	abinash_panda: I am using these datasets too
@HeikoS	jiaolong: you are next?
 jiaolong	OK
@HeikoS	hushell not coming?
 jiaolong	Hi, I am working on the project: large-scale structured prediction with approximate inference.
 jiaolong	He is not there
 jiaolong	I have two major algorithm to implement before the midterm: graph cuts and max-product linear programming relaxation (MPLP). I have finished graph cuts, its unit-test and the related examples. I submitted PR #2319 and it is under review.
 jiaolong	The current results are compared to pystruct and we obtained comparable and even slightly better results.
@HeikoS	jiaolong: nice! what about speed?
 jiaolong	The next algorithm is expected to finish in the following 3~4 days. Since the unit-test and examples of these two can be shared. So I think I can finish these tasks in time.
 jiaolong	Haven't compared the speed. But we are using C++.
@HeikoS	jiaolong: still interesting to do some rough comparisons
 jiaolong	pystruct uses only python. I will compare speed later.
@HeikoS	jiaolong: cool, good to hear things are going well
@HeikoS	jiaolong: what about schedule and notebook?
 jiaolong	I think I am on schedule. The notebook will be based on current multilabel classification example
 jiaolong	We will add more computer vision demos to the notebook later
@HeikoS	jiaolong: looking very forward to read about this. As for everyone, it owuld be cool if you compared these methods to competitors in the notebook
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	so the last one would be kislay
 jiaolong	But it is for the second half
@HeikoS	and pickle27
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	 my project is about integrating opencv with shogun and changing some infrastructure here which supports that.
 kislay	 I have written a factory class for the conversion of Matrix from OpenCV's Mat class to that of ours. On its basis I have written 3 examples as markdowns on KNN,NN and SVM showcasing it. After that I completed the EigenFaces example. Right Now I am working on FisherFaces as there are some changes that needed to be added to the current MCLDA class for using it for performing FiserFaces.

 kislay	As for the schedule, I am 2 days behind it for now. After getting this over, I will start on license plate recognition showcasing "how to train a pattern recognition system with shogun". After which, Scene, gender classifications will follow and this makes mostly of the second half.

@HeikoS	kislay: yeah there is really room for some ultra cool applications there
 kislay	yeah HeikoS . thats true. :)
 pickle27	I think we are doing good on the schedule too, I need to find the time to finish doing a proper review of the factor class so we can get it merged
@HeikoS	kislay, pickle27 btw since deep learning is so trendy for computer vision, have you considered using some of khalednasr, Theo__, lisitsyn projects methods to do some tasks?
 pickle27	And the examples are turning out nice
@lisitsyn	yes should be possible
 kislay	I haven't thought about it . but will love to..
 Theo__	I think we are not there yet.
 Theo__	Maybe when we have some examples running on normal datasets
 pickle27	Yeah I think we're open to suggestions for other computer vision examples
@HeikoS	Theo__: ok, do you think this might be possible later in July?
 Theo__	people could take our features
@HeikoS	Would be cool to get some synergy going in between the projects
@lisitsyn	Theo__: you mean train some RBM and stack an SVM?
 Theo__	simplest synergy: use a conv net to classify images
 Theo__	take the features that come out and use them in a graphical model to do specific tasks
 Theo__	i.e. segmentation
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, Theo__, Shogun has all these super large scale linear SVM implementations, when combined with some magic features from your deep stuff, this might be a nice example
-!- lambday_ [67157f4f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.127.79] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	kislay: maybe get back to the guys in a couple of weeks
 kislay	sure sure.
@HeikoS	kislay: I guess you are busy with other things for now :)
 Theo__	We can certainly discuss some synergy with another project.
 Theo__	I'd need some blabla before I see it.
 kislay	yeah, pretty much HeikoS
@HeikoS	Theo__: haha :)
@HeikoS	ok, I think that was all the updates.
@HeikoS	(Did I forget anyone=
@HeikoS	)
@HeikoS	Comments anyone?
@HeikoS	Ok then, quickly the last part before the beer :D
@HeikoS	This is important for students to do it and mentors to encourage students to do it:
@HeikoS	3. Deliverables for second part.
@HeikoS	The second part of the program is a bit shorter as we expect you to do a number of things to consider the projects as &lsquo;done&rsquo;.
@HeikoS	"done"
@HeikoS	(copy paste mess)
@HeikoS	Plan at least two weeks for those. This means your coding should be done two weeks *before* the end of GSoC on the 18th of August.
@HeikoS	Aim for being done with most things at the beginning of August! Deliverables at the end are

@HeikoS	For people who write algorithms:
@HeikoS	a) Working code
-!- lambday_ is now known as lambday
@HeikoS	b) Unit tests for all of you parts (done on the fly)
@HeikoS	c) Integration tests aka python_modular API examples for all your methods. These just demonstrate how to use the API on example. From the python examples, you can then generate test data that is put into the shogun-data repository.
@HeikoS	Ask us if unclear. A nice example for API examples is here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2311
@HeikoS	parijat_:  I borrowed your example here :)
@HeikoS	d) PROPER documentation of your code in doxygen
@HeikoS	This means that all classes have descriptions including math, reference paper & implementation, and intuition on the methods, description how to plug things together. Don&rsquo;t just put placeholder 1-line sentences.
 parijat_	:)
@HeikoS	This is what people read at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/namespaceshogun.html
@HeikoS	Also, all methods and members should be documented. Your code also should contain some high-level comments if its not obvious from the code what is going on.
@HeikoS	and
@HeikoS	For everyone:
@HeikoS	d) IPython notebook writeups.
@HeikoS	This should be a full documentation of your project, explain the maths of the used methods, illustrate usage on toy datasets, and also give a *real life* example where you apply your awesome algorithm on some dataset from a reference paper or a machine learning repository.
@HeikoS	Aim for something interesting. The notebook is what is mainly exposed to the outside world, so they should be as interesting, cool looking, and illustrating as possible.
@HeikoS	Give them all the love you can.
@HeikoS	and the final one
@HeikoS	e) Peer review.
@HeikoS	Every student is supposed to review another student&rsquo;s project 2 weeks before end of GSoC (That&rsquo;s why things should be ready until then).
@HeikoS	Play with the other persons code, actually use it on a dataset, read the documentation, read the notebook, find bugs/typos/inconsistencies, discuss questions.
@HeikoS	Imagine you are some external person evaluating the quality of Shogun and try to improve things where you can.
@HeikoS	We will pair your up in the next meeting. You can send us suggestions.
@HeikoS	For now, please every student create a list of bullet things to peer-review. That is: Class names, examples, notebook names.
@HeikoS	Populate these lists from now on so that they are ready for your peer at beginning of August.
@HeikoS	Again, plan to spend some time and effort on this. We really want you to exchange ideas and get exposed to each others work.
@HeikoS	Comments on this? Suggestions?
@HeikoS	Mentors, please make sure your student takes the time to do these points, they take time
@HeikoS	Ok that was the third part.
@HeikoS	Any other things someone would like to discuss in this meeting?
@HeikoS	In that case: Meeting closed. Thanks everyone!
@HeikoS	 BTW. There is Stammtisch every Monday evening (European time), please try to attend those!
 Theo__	I am typically in other meetings at such times, monday is always packed. Just so you know why I never show ;)

@wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah it would be cool to get this merged soon
@HeikoS	very useful
 lambday	wiking: it works with cmake - but we can use whatever backend as we wish in our code - irrespective of global backend set
@HeikoS	wiking: or update to a better thing
@wiking	lambday: what's the pr number
@HeikoS	wiking: need to think about another build with the current version
@HeikoS	wiking: its merged in linalg branch

 khalednasr	lambday, I need to check if that works on any machine though. does travis have viennacl?
 lambday	khalednasr: that I don't know! wiking?
 lambday	khalednasr: but make sure that these things work locally at least!
@wiking	HeikoS: that's why i'm telling u this
@wiking	HeikoS: just try login
@HeikoS	lambday: I think the design is good now
 lambday	HeikoS: feature selection?
@HeikoS	wiking: I see, ehm, how to do this? Not sure whether I understand what you mean
@HeikoS	lambday:  yes
@wiking	khalednasr: it can have viennacl
@HeikoS	wiking: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/ gives me the server error now
@wiking	HeikoS: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/
@wiking	HeikoS: open it in a different browser
@HeikoS	I see,
@HeikoS	wiking: also server error
@wiking	HeikoS: and in the top left u have login button
 khalednasr	wiking, can you give me some tips on how to add it? I know practically nothing about tarvis
 khalednasr	travis*
@wiking	khalednasr: viennacl has ubuntu package?
 lambday	HeikoS: thanks :) so I'll be going ahead with this design
@wiking	or do u know a good .deb repository for ubuntu 12.04 for viennacl?
 khalednasr	wiking, I don't think so. It's a header only library
 khalednasr	wiking, it needs opencl however
@wiking	khalednasr: 1.1.2-6
@wiking	is it too old?
@wiking	http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/precise/viennacl
 khalednasr	yeah the current is 1.5.2
@HeikoS	wiking: I gotta go, please also share your thoughts on how feasible it is to do a workshop in the shogun cloud
@wiking	HeikoS: heheh depends on the # of ppl
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe we can simulate 50 people connecting and running some notebooks?
* lambday brb after tea!
@HeikoS	say 80
@wiking	HeikoS: we cannot serve 50 ppl
@wiking	only about 20
@wiking	tops
@wiking	with fatbot
@HeikoS	wiking: I know, but since they offered us coputing power
@HeikoS	we can do what
@HeikoS	that
@wiking	well once we have that
@wiking	we can do that
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	wiking: so for example give them our (updated) docker image
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah so I just want to know what I should ask for
@wiking	HeikoS: hw
@wiking	or some cloud access
@HeikoS	both in terms of how much and how it should concretely look
@wiking	like aws
@wiking	khalednasr: mmm then we need to roll our on
@wiking	khalednasr: but i dunno how good is that
@HeikoS	wiking: could you answer something specific in the mail? Then I can forward that
@wiking	khalednasr: i mean travis instances are some qemu/kvm vps instances
@HeikoS	wiking: I think they are happy to pay for that (at least for the workshop)
@wiking	so i dont know what u could actually do there with viennacl
@wiking	HeikoS: ok
@HeikoS	and then peolpe at the workshop might donate server time to us
@HeikoS	wiking: if it works nicely, you know
@HeikoS	wiking: very good chance to get something from that
@wiking	HeikoS: ok i can try to setup the gcloud stuff we got from googs
@HeikoS	wiking: ah also cool
@HeikoS	wiking: well but they will provide things, just need to know what
@HeikoS	both me and the guy who decides that have no idea about the technical details :D
@HeikoS	so you need to communitcate through me over the guy with the other technical person setting things up
@HeikoS	wiking: ok gotta go, see you later

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, lambday , wiking , alright I'll start by modifying linalg to add the changes described here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2272 and test that locally. Then I'll see what we can do about getting it to build on travis
 khalednasr	I'm not sure when I'll be able to work on this though. gonna have to discuss this with lisitsyn and theo first
