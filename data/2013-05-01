 alibezz	lisitsyn: iglesiasg: how do the embed methods at tapkee_methods.hpp are supposed to work? I mean, in the bigger picture of shogun's architectute?

 Asix3	Hi! I'm going to try an get an application together for GSOC. I'm wondering if there's any way to search the shogun mailing list
 Asix3	I've subscribed already, but I'm not sure if there's an archive of past messages
 Asix3	...and I just found it. Nevermind!
 shogun-buildbot	build #325 of nightly_none is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/325
 alibezz	lisitsyn: hey, when you specified on step 7 "Add a class CSammonMapping that calls the tapkee library code for sammon mapping (check PR #1015 for example).Add a class CSammonMapping that calls the tapkee library code for sammon mapping (check PR #1015 for example)."
 alibezz	lisitsyn: you mean a class in src/shogun/converter, right?  i'm assuming so as of now
 alibezz	=)

 Asix3	ok, I've forked shogun from git and cloned it to my system. I've ran ./configure, but 'make' isn't doing anything
 Asix3	well, it's giving me: make: *** No rule to make target '.config'.  Stop.
 Asix3	...and it looks like I figured that problem out, too -- sorry!

 hushell	Hello guys I am Shell
 hushell	Hi Sergey I see your reply I come here before going to bed
@lisitsyn	hushell: hey
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: nice to see you here
@lisitsyn	oops
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	ok nice to see you both here
@lisitsyn	hah
 hushell	nice to meet you guys
@lisitsyn	hushell: alright just hang there when you are available
 hushell	I have a short question regarding the Binarylabels::score_to_probabilities()
@lisitsyn	although you are in a totally different timezone
@lisitsyn	hushell: what is the question?
 hushell	yeah I am in UtC-8
@lisitsyn	haha 12 hours between us
 hushell	why this function doesn't output anything expect changing the confidences
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: Hi!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^ could you please answer?
@HeikoS	hushell: why should it?
@HeikoS	the labels have a vector for the scores and one for the confidences
@HeikoS	this translates scores to confidences
@HeikoS	why should it do something else?
@lisitsyn	have to go now
 hushell	Could you take a look at Eq.(7) in this paper: http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/10/39/55/PDF/cr102875872670.pdf
 hushell	it needs the learned parameters
 hushell	I don't know much about Platt's rescoring, it seems like a calibration
 hushell	using a sigmoid function
@HeikoS	looking ...
@HeikoS	hushell: I see
@HeikoS	you need the A and B
@HeikoS	let me quickly check the code
 hushell	exactly
@HeikoS	ok, my suggestion then is:
@HeikoS	to put the sigmoid fitting method into CStatistics
@HeikoS	as fit_sigmoid(SGVector<float64_t>)
@HeikoS	this method returns A and B
@HeikoS	and is called from the binary labels
@HeikoS	hushell: what do you think of this?
 hushell	Where is the CStatistics?
 hushell	So you mean do it in another way
@HeikoS	hushell: no just make it modular
@HeikoS	or wait
 hushell	Ok I found it
 hushell	documentation is great!
@HeikoS	since you need the scores *and* the parameters
@HeikoS	and sigmoid fitting is not likely to happen somewhere else
@HeikoS	maybe put it into the scores_to_probabilities method
@HeikoS	dont really know whats best
@HeikoS	what do you think?
 hushell	could you explain a bit how the scores_to_probabilities being implemented?
 hushell	what's the target to fit?
 hushell	sorry I haven't read this piece of code
@HeikoS	no worries
@HeikoS	it does two things: 1) fit a sigmoid via newton search, result is parameters a and b. 2) uses this sigmoid to compute all the probabilities given the scores
@HeikoS	code is taken from a paper btw
@HeikoS	have a look at the last lines of the method
@HeikoS	there are the important parts
@HeikoS	and also a and b
 hushell	the algorithm is very clear
 hushell	so why not just store the a and b
@HeikoS	not sure about this
@HeikoS	scores might change
@HeikoS	and without calling the method again they outdate
@HeikoS	maybe make a and b optional parameters
@HeikoS	if they are provided, they are not coimputed
@HeikoS	via method in CStatistics
@HeikoS	but you can also precompute yourself and then pass them
 hushell	that's true it's being call during testing
@HeikoS	I think thats good
@HeikoS	do you want to move the code or should I do it?
-!- poojits [75d35d4a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.93.74] has joined #shogun
 hushell	I am not very clear how to do it
@HeikoS	hushell: dont worry
 hushell	Seems a good chance to learn
@HeikoS	I will do it now, give me 10 mins
 hushell	which function should I call from CStatistics
@HeikoS	you already have lots of stuff in your PR, lets not make it even more complex :)
@HeikoS	I will tell you in a bit
 hushell	Okay let's see how you make it :)
 hushell	Thanks so much. That's true, many files are involved
 hushell	It
 hushell	It
 hushell	It's my first time to code in such a regular way
 hushell	I just went through the code, it looks like the targets come from the counting of positives and negatives

 hushell	Awesome!
 hushell	Thanks for your help!
 hushell	I have to go to bed now, talk you later! Have a nice day!
@HeikoS	hushell: ok good night!
@HeikoS	have a look at the score_to_prob method
@HeikoS	there you will see how you can use CStatistics to get the sigmoid parameters

 alibezz	iglesiasg: i started the implementation of the Sammon mapping. things are going a little slow because of my other tasks, but they're indeed evolving!... hehe i'm sort of basing my implementation on the IsoMap one

 alibezz	i'm writing the class under converter. is it the right thing to do?
 alibezz	yes i am. i still have some doubts on how to test my implementation
 alibezz	should i write a little program or does shogun have some prototypes for isomap for example, and so i can easily modify it?

@iglesiasg	alibezz: re
@iglesiasg	alibezz: sorry for the long dealy
@iglesiasg	delay*
@iglesiasg	alibezz: so it can be done with a class in converter
@iglesiasg	alibezz: however, the DR in shogun is provided via tapkee
@iglesiasg	so implementing sammon mapping in tapkee directly would be a better choice
@iglesiasg	something similar to what lisitsyn described in the instructions in the github issue

 alibezz	iglesiasg: but it's gonna take me a while to have it all done. I have to prepare some lectures... hahahahha
@iglesiasg	hehe I see. No worries
 alibezz	iglesiasg: the idea of sammon mapping is interesting though
@iglesiasg	alibezz: aham! I don't really know about it
@iglesiasg	alibezz: so it tries to minimize the error in the distance between input and projected space I read
 alibezz	iglesiasg: yup. I'm going to implement using gradient descent, just like in the matlab code.
 alibezz	iglesiasg: but maybe sgd would perform better. it's something to test in the future
 alibezz	iglesiasg: how can i test my code? should i write a little program or do they have something for isomap that i can reuse?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: maybe one of the examples under examples/undocumented?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: or even any of tapkee examples
 alibezz	iglesiasg: chill! didn't check these folders yet. ha
@lisitsyn	kind of re
@lisitsyn	alibezz: oh the idea of sammon mapping is as old as my parents probably :D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: around 1969 according to wikipedia
@iglesiasg	good number btw
@lisitsyn	a little younger then
@lisitsyn	the sammon mapping is I mean
 alibezz	lisitsyn: iglesiasg: well my parents are def older. i'm 25. hehe they're from the 50s
@lisitsyn	alibezz: 22 and 1961 here
 alibezz	lisitsyn: you guys are rather young! when did you start coding?
@lisitsyn	alibezz: as professionals or?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: I am 23 and started at university 5 years ago
@iglesiasg	haha but I am no professional :)
@iglesiasg	5 years ago with pascal omg
@lisitsyn	I've been paid for programming for ehmm somewhere 1.5 to 2 years so far
 alibezz	lisitsyn: weren't you coding before that?
@lisitsyn	alibezz: of course, for some more years
@lisitsyn	from school may be
 alibezz	got it
 alibezz	cool
 alibezz	i started coding when i was 17
@lisitsyn	>5 probably
@iglesiasg	ooh you are old hardcore programmers :P
 alibezz	but mostly in research projects
@lisitsyn	I remember I was coding some puzzles when I was 11
@lisitsyn	with pascal
 alibezz	hahaha i don't have that much of experience in c++ tho
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: oh that's super cool
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I regret none taught me anything about programming when I was younger
 alibezz	yea same here
@iglesiasg	I didn't even know it existed before I started uni lol
 alibezz	i wish i've learnt it earlier
 alibezz	i spent most of my life studying french and english. ha
@iglesiasg	oh la al
@iglesiasg	oh la la hehe
 alibezz	yea my life was kinda crazy. I like programming but I wish I knew C++ better. hhehhe well, it's all good
 alibezz	living is learning lolz

@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/libshogun/converter_isomap.cpp
 alibezz	oh in libshogun? duh
 alibezz	iglesiasg: i was looking for something in the python directories dunno why
@iglesiasg	alibezz: aham ok
 alibezz	iglesiasg: sorry for that. and thanks ;)
@iglesiasg	alibezz: no problem ;)
@iglesiasg	there should be another example for isomap in python_modular or so in any case
 alibezz	not really to be honest. or i'm crazy.
 alibezz	because this is one of the dirs i checked out :O
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/python_modular/converter_isomap_modular.py
@iglesiasg	?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: maybe you checked static interfaces
 alibezz	iglesiasg: yeah maybe. or maybe i' m really crazy. there's always a possibility lolz
@iglesiasg	heh
@wiking	lisitsyn: around?
 cameron__	the generate_testdata.py complains about unknown category classifier.
-!- ozan [~ozan@ee-167-250.eee.metu.edu.tr] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	cameron__: how are you running it?
 cameron__	iglesiasg: just by ./generator_testdata.py
@iglesiasg	cameron__: so did you modify anyting to add a new classifier or sth?
@iglesiasg	cameron__: dummy question -- have you compiled and installed for python_modular?
 cameron__	iglesiasg: yes, i've been playing around with shogun in python
 cameron__	iglesiasg: nvm, i'll try and figure it out myself. should just be sth minor
@iglesiasg	cameron__: ok
@iglesiasg	cameron__: I cannot test right now in my machine if it works, but I'd bet it should
@lisitsyn	wiking: yes

 viksvampire19	Hi everyone..
 alibezz	lisitsyn: ping
@lisitsyn	alibezz: pong
 alibezz	lisitsyn: I'm trying to run the converter_isomap_modular.py example
 alibezz	and it gives me this error: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/fm_train_real.dat'
 alibezz	although i downloaded the data
@lisitsyn	how?
 alibezz	and made the symbolic link point to it
@lisitsyn	bahh why did you do that
 alibezz	well the data wasnt here hehe i just pointed it
@lisitsyn	all you needed was 'git submodule init --update'
 alibezz	oh nice
 alibezz	let me see if it works then
@lisitsyn	just restore your symlinks
@lisitsyn	they were here
 alibezz	ok no worries
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok so 17 proposals by now
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: + votjakovr + gsomix
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, please mark the ones you intend to mentor
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: with wish to mentor?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012
@sonney2k	looking at this image
@sonney2k	we got 25 applications in the last 3 days
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: see # increased just before
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: lets calm down - everybody gets less it seems
@sonney2k	maybe it is the same - lets see
@sonney2k	well we have maybe -10 compared to 2012
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: so we decided about 4?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and please accept the one you would want to mentor most
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no why?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: well more or less
@sonney2k	nothing is set in stone
@lisitsyn	okay 5
@sonney2k	yes more or less
@lisitsyn	no I don't mean in stone
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where is your supertask guy (tm)?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: having exams :) but wrote me an email, I told him to apply asap
 alibezz	lisitsyn: until which day can I send the patch?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: like, I'm gonna send it anyway, of course
@lisitsyn	alibezz: good question
 alibezz	lisitsyn: but to be able to participate of the GSoC selection
@lisitsyn	let me check the date
@lisitsyn	alibezz: okay it is very unlikely to be that long but assignment due is May 24
 alibezz	lisitsyn: okay. fortunately I'll send the sammon mapping until Friday ;) let's see how things work
 alibezz	hopefully...
@sonney2k	alibezz, we decide before may 20
@sonney2k	so anything until then my make us reconsider
@lisitsyn	alibezz: ^ so I will have some time to change my mind
@lisitsyn	we have to decide ideas ASAP
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: sure, makes sense
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I mean to ask for slots
@lisitsyn	but not real assignment
@sonney2k	yes we make our slot request based on the number of excellent proposals we get
@sonney2k	so we already *now* put names to tasks to get an idea of #slots
 alibezz	yeah the things is that week is full of deadlines for me. haha i wish i had known of the applications earlier =(
 alibezz	but i totally understand it all. if it doesn't work, it's ok! i like helping anyways =)
@sonney2k	alibezz, well may 20 is the hard deadline
@sonney2k	on may 22 there will be a dedup meeting
@sonney2k	err may 24 is the dedup meeting
@sonney2k	but in any case google has the last word and does the official announcement on may27
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: syst3mw0rm
@lisitsyn	yeah so one more month of suffering
-!- Netsplit over, joins: syst3mw0rm
 gsomix	lisitsyn, everyday I'm suffering, life is pain, haha... :(
 alibezz	lisitsyn: git submodule init --update didn't work actually
@sonney2k	submodule update --init
@lisitsyn	oops :D
@sonney2k	alibezz, other way round!
@lisitsyn	my mistake sorry
 alibezz	huaauahua makes more sense
 alibezz	it's because both init and update are commands
 alibezz	who knows... maybe --update was a path. duh
-!- ozan [~ozan@ee-167-250.eee.metu.edu.tr] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 alibezz	lisitsyn: i'll need some style tips today, later. sammon mapping has a lot of parameters and i'd like to discuss what's the most elegant way of dealing with them in the shogun architecture. but I'll write/make a bunch of tests here before. and finish this crazy lecture i'm preparing. hahaah
@lisitsyn	alright
 alibezz	lisitsyn: well, the git update worked, but the error remains
 alibezz	lisitsyn: IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../data/fm_train_real.dat'
 alibezz	any idea?
@lisitsyn	alibezz: you said you changed symlinks
@lisitsyn	are they listed in 'git status' output?
 alibezz	actually i'm working in a brand new branch at this very moment
 alibezz	so no symlinks were changed here
@lisitsyn	is there a file ../data/fm_train_real.dat then?
 alibezz	yup
@lisitsyn	what is the dir you run example in
@lisitsyn	?
 alibezz	if you could execute ~/shogun/examples/undocumented$ python python_modular/converter_isomap_modular.py
 alibezz	i'd be glad ;)
@lisitsyn	run in python_modular folder
@lisitsyn	the path is not absolute that's why you get troubles
 alibezz	yeah it's not absolute but i thought the execution would take the file where the python code is as a reference, not from where i'm running
 alibezz	but it worked. ;)

@lisitsyn	no, why? pwd is pwd
 alibezz	lisitsyn: yes it is. it's from where i'm running not from where it's at. just got confused. he
 alibezz	well now i can start writing tests and going further with the sammon mapping
@lisitsyn	nice

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok so I am convinced now that we will get 30 proposals until the end of may 3rd
@lisitsyn	haha
@iglesiasg	is it starting to grow exponentially?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: 17 so far
@iglesiasg	you know what to do if you get too many

 KMcQuisten	Not too bad.  I put a question up on the mailing list a bit earlier today, and I partially answered my own question, but i'm still having some trouble.
@lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: oh sorry hadn't enough time to check your question
@lisitsyn	will take a look a bit later
 KMcQuisten	Righto.
 KMcQuisten	I didn't know if it was something that i was just missing or if it was a deeper issue

 cameron__	hi,
 cameron__	just wondering why when you fetch from github from shogun
 cameron__	the data folder is empty
@iglesiasg	cameron__: it is in another repo, a submodule
@iglesiasg	git submodule update or so should work
 cameron__	thanks
 cameron__	Trying to update the submodule , but failed the travis build.
@iglesiasg	cameron__: mmm I don't understand
@iglesiasg	you cannot get the data repository because the travis build failed?
 cameron__	i got it
 cameron__	made a change
 cameron__	tried to do commit and push
 cameron__	i did it inside in the submoduel folder, then in the shogun folder
 cameron__	changes appeared on github. but didn't seem right
 cameron__	https://github.com/goldbug/shogun/commit/7790dd146bf5e315faba55ff926d9f7e080b5408
