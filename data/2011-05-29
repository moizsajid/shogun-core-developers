@sonney2k	more involved than I thought...
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r52ce59f / (82 files in 9 dirs): rename preproc -> preprocessor - http://bit.ly/kgUDUq
@sonney2k	now for the CClassifier rename...

@sonney2k	blackburn, around?
@sonney2k	I've done the preproc PreProc etc transition
@sonney2k	does it that look good to you or do you have any other ideas for improvement?
@sonney2k	I am doing the machine transition now
@sonney2k	Current plan is to create a directory machine and then  move the KernelMachine DistanceMachine in there
@sonney2k	in addition Classifier and rename it to Machine
@sonney2k	and also LinearClassifier - and name it LinearMachine
 sploving	sonney2k, I debug one day for lua MatrixTest.lua example and now it works. I pushed it. when you have time please take a look at it. l8r
@sonney2k	sploving, nice
@sonney2k	sploving, not sure why but this thing cannot be applied
@sonney2k	I think you need to rebase your patch against git master
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r54150e8 / (65 files in 10 dirs):
 CIA-32	shogun: Transistion: rename CClassifier to CMachine
 CIA-32	shogun: correspondingly rename CLinearClassifier -> CLinearMachine
 CIA-32	shogun: and move them to the machine/ subdirectory - http://bit.ly/kKpVM6
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok we have Machines now :D
@sonney2k	sploving, btw thanks for the status email to the mailinglist!
 sploving	sonney2k, you are welcome. git fetch && git merge upstream/master. fatal: Entry 'src/configure' would be overwritten by merge. Cannot merge

 blackburn	sonney2k: now yes
 blackburn	reading..
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have only one idea about preproc - to structurize it some another way, i.e. now dim reduction processor are all inherited from SimplePreproc<float64_t> - looks strange
 blackburn	I'd like to study more about MDS for genomic data sets :) will try a bit later
@bettyboo	blackburn, smart!
 blackburn	bettyboo: just like you
@bettyboo	blackburn: well then send another request: btw I also noted that you don't have newlines after and before loops ... that is also sth I would like to have for readability
 sploving	blackburn, /root/shogun/src/libshogun/classifier/DistanceMachine.cpp:32: multiple definition of `shogun::CDistanceMachine::~CDistanceMachine()'
 blackburn	yees?
 sploving	what does that mean? I  reset my repo to the trunk, but when compile it shows the following error
 blackburn	sploving: will try it now too
 sploving	sonney2k, I reset it to the uptream, change my files need commit and pushed it!
 blackburn	compiling..
 sploving	blackburn, what is going?
 blackburn	sploving: compiling :)
 sploving	blackburn,so slow? how many cors of you machine?
 blackburn	it is 2 core T4300 processor in my notebook
 sploving	you could use make -j4
 blackburn	what it is?
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	jobs, see now
 blackburn	sploving: done, everything is ok
 blackburn	no error you mentioned before
 sploving	you mean libshogun and python?
 sploving	I compile lua
 blackburn	ah
 sploving	I will have a try again
 blackburn	anyway I think there is no difference
 blackburn	because the error is in libshogun
 blackburn	damn it is fast!
 blackburn	thank you for -j4 advice

@sonney2k	blackburn, so looks ok for you ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: preproc?
@sonney2k	blackburn, preproc and machine
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah it is ok
@sonney2k	hmmhh sploving above didn't do make distclean or git clean -dfx before
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not sure if the machine directory shouldn't have the regression etc stuff as subdirs
@sonney2k	blackburn, should machine's classify function be renamed to apply ?
@sonney2k	or do you have a better name?
 blackburn	sonney2k: train - apply, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, good for me
@sonney2k	train we have
 blackburn	sonney2k: for me too
@sonney2k	but classify needs a rename to apply() then
@sonney2k	that has to be done manually though
 blackburn	it makes sense for clustering and regression issues
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	currently we have
@sonney2k	CMachine
@sonney2k	CLinearMachine
@sonney2k	CDistanceMachine
@sonney2k	CKernelMachine
 blackburn	about CDistanceMachine
 blackburn	it have nice thread based distance calculation routines
 blackburn	why we have not ones in distance?
@sonney2k	blackburn, IIRC distance has those already
 blackburn	sonney2k: for example get_distance_matrix do it without threads
@sonney2k	blackburn, but I would say you only comment on the structure of shogun and do the remaining things afterwards
@sonney2k	blackburn, i think it does with threads
@sonney2k	I mean you have exams which are more important for now
 blackburn	no problem with exams, will study it this evening :)
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: classifier, clustering might be subdirs of machine
@sonney2k	if distance matrix is not yet pthreaded - submit patches sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah - thought so too
@sonney2k	regression too
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not very familiar with threads used here, will be think about just after finishing some important steps in my dimreduction
 blackburn	some of algos should be parallelized for sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah
@sonney2k	very welcome...
 blackburn	and I would implement kd-tree or balltree
 blackburn	seems working with instance-learning (or neighborhood-based, etc) algos is my fate :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is a lightning fast kdtree implementation available already
 blackburn	because I started shogun developing with kNN and my project uses it too
@sonney2k	by john langford
@sonney2k	so we could borrow his code :)
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	well it simplifies work :)
@sonney2k	but structure first
 blackburn	just adapt it to shogun
@sonney2k	so what do you think should I move the machine derived things into machine ?
 blackburn	yeah, of course
@sonney2k	and should I make subdirs there or not
@sonney2k	probably or?
 blackburn	subdirs sounds nice
@sonney2k	I mean regression -> machine/regression
 blackburn	btw, may be some more namespaces should be nice too
@sonney2k	blackburn, but how do we reflect that change in e.g. python_modular?
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	currently it is from shogun.Classifier import *
 blackburn	shogun.Machine.Classifier or shogun.Classifier?
@sonney2k	we don't want shogun.Machine.Classifier I think
 blackburn	yeah sounds cumbersome
@sonney2k	so I am not sure if we should actually move things already
@sonney2k	shogun isn't that big yet...
 blackburn	is it possible to make shogun.Classifier just a shorthand name for libshogun/machine/classifier?
@sonney2k	if we were numpy then it makes sense
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure but it is not consistent then
@sonney2k	I would prefer the same structure in C++ as in *_modular
@sonney2k	otherwise it will be confusing
 blackburn	sounds reasonable
 blackburn	okay so let it be the way it is now
@sonney2k	I would then add a shogun.Machine for the modular interfaces
 CIA-32	shogun: Baozeng Ding master * r6688b5c / (4 files in 2 dirs): use lua_objlen to count table size, improve error handing, and add lua vector/matrix test - http://bit.ly/klNC7w
 blackburn	the only issue - looks confusing then classes in some 'package' are inherited from the other one
 blackburn	but no other way now
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw 'make -j4' rocks, it makes shogun compile fast!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I use that all the time of course
@sonney2k	(I have it set in MAKEFLAGS='-j4')
@sonney2k	so I don't have to specify it
 blackburn	where I can set it?
@sonney2k	bashrc]
 blackburn	ah. i see
@sonney2k	i have my son now on my left arm...
@sonney2k	slight handicap
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw PreProc was wrong indeed
 blackburn	looks like wrong camel-case
 blackburn	cause word is Preprocessor not pre processor and so on
 blackburn	so I like it more :)
@sonney2k	me too
@sonney2k	more readable
 blackburn	just adapted LLE for new naming
@sonney2k	and we avoid unneeded shortcuts anyway
@sonney2k	LLE should also have a proper name :)
 blackburn	anyway it is not in trunk so I have much time to think about how to name it
 blackburn	but LocallyLinearEmbedding is bad too
@sonney2k	it says more than LLE I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have a very simple idea about codestyle
 blackburn	just modify it http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
@sonney2k	which link exactly?
 blackburn	I just mean if we will have an 'official' codestyle
 blackburn	new developers should not make some not-shogun-style code
 blackburn	it could simplify your work
@sonney2k	we have that though not as erfect
@sonney2k	p
@sonney2k	cookie time
@sonney2k	l8r
 blackburn	well then I will have some game theory time :D

 serialhex	OOH!!!! I WANNA POKE SOMEONE IN THE EYE!!!!
 serialhex	sonney2k: so i keep getting this error when i compile shogun, i have the configure string i'm using & the last little bit of the output.  if you have any ideas of things you want me to look at let me know, i've got a few things i'm doing and will get back to you asap!
@sonney2k	serialhex, look in the mirror ;-)
 serialhex	in the mirror??
@sonney2k	which error?
 serialhex	DUHH!!!
@sonney2k	^^eye poking :D
 serialhex	one sec :P
 serialhex	https://gist.github.com/9b28bde8718703fe1b66
@sonney2k	but only the left eye please ;-)
 serialhex	why?  left eye wonky or somethin??  can you see better out of your right eye?
@sonney2k	serialhex, do a git clean -dfx
 serialhex	kk
 serialhex	anything else before i try the make?
* serialhex is configurin & makin!
 serialhex	i've got some ppl coming over in a minute sonney2k so i've got to handle that & i'll let you know how things go, all right?
 serialhex	(and besides, the compiling takes FOR FREAKING EVAR!!!)
@sonney2k	serialhex, heh
@sonney2k	deal with them - let them choose the weapons ;-)
 serialhex	they're here!  i'll bbl!!
@bettyboo	8)
 serialhex	EXACTLY!!!
 blackburn	damn stochastic game with shity bellman equations :E
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you think should I *add* a apply() and apply_to_example() function to all the classifiers and make that one call the classify() / classify_example() one that already exists in classifiers or should I rename the classify() etc functions in classifier's?
 blackburn	sonney2k: to _add_ sounds easily :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I did the other thing but now I am not convinced that this was the right deision
@sonney2k	diaper time...
 blackburn	you renamed it?
 blackburn	not bad too
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know... it will break all scripts..
 blackburn	yeah a little revolution
@sonney2k	CMachine / CClassifier rename is not intrusive for the interface side
@sonney2k	so I don't like it
 blackburn	well time for some sleep
 blackburn	three days - three exams to go :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: see you
@sonney2k	I tend to revert the changes ...
 blackburn	which changes have you done?
@sonney2k	and only add the apply function
@sonney2k	blackburn, all the replacement classify -> apply
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	classify_example -> apply_example
 blackburn	apply_to_example looks better
@sonney2k	but for classifiers I think we should keep these functions
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah sure but that is not the problem
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw what about no apply_to*? apply(features) & apply(vector)?
@sonney2k	and apply(idx) ?
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	some kind of polymorphism :)
@bettyboo	8)
 blackburn	well, time to bed :) now really
 blackburn	see you
