 makokal	hey are they any mentors online?
 makokal	esp for GPs
 blackburn	I am afraid GPs mentor could be reached only by email
 blackburn	have never seen him there
 makokal	kk, mail on the way
 blackburn	makokal: I can't be considered as mentor but I am responsible for any development
 makokal	oh, I just want to ask about clarification on imeplementing GPs for gsoc this year
 blackburn	yeah ask
 makokal	on the desc, on regression is mentioned, I was wondering if using GPs for classification will be part of the project
 makokal	for dev it should not mean much, but just a clarification
 makokal	as I am working on finalizing my document for applying for this
 blackburn	it is up to you generally
 blackburn	I mean if you want to do both regression and classification - it would be better for sure
 makokal	ok, I will just add it on the final bits(so depending on the progress, add it or not)
 blackburn	but this should be clarified with Oliver as well
 makokal	ya am mailing him at the moment
 blackburn	and consider to come with small patch! it is a requirement
 makokal	sure
 makokal	thanks

 blackburn	monday is a hard day lol
 n4nd0	blackburn: feeling sleepy? :P
 blackburn	n4nd0: strange but not at all - funny thing is only 9 here are idling
 blackburn	but before it was ~20 :)
 n4nd0	that's actually right, funny
 blackburn	n4nd0: what time is it there you are?
 blackburn	I am curious whether you practice to sleep sometimes :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha I do, I do
 n4nd0	but not that much actually, I've always been ok not sleeping that much
 n4nd0	it is 9:40
 blackburn	for me it is ok as it is 11.39 here
 blackburn	but it is 8.39 in Sweden?
 n4nd0	mmm no
 blackburn	9? :)
 n4nd0	it is 9:40 in Sweden
 n4nd0	yesterday we changed the time in here, summer time! :)
 blackburn	ah yeah
 n4nd0	did you change it too there?
 blackburn	thing our gov't decided to abandon
 blackburn	no, we have static const time now
 blackburn	:D

 blackburn	hi
 harshit_	did you hav  a look at my pull request ?
 harshit_	NewtonSVM
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	I think Soeren should take a look as well
 harshit_	okay .. So what do you think how long will it take to merge into shogun
 harshit_	Also wanted to discuss Deep learning idea !
 blackburn	I will check the code again a little bit later
 harshit_	okay, with whom do you think i should discuss my deep learning idea !
 harshit_	soren ?
 blackburn	yeah probably

@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I tried this director stuff
@sonney2k	got only crashes though
 blackburn	sonney2k: was it working? I am very curious with it
 blackburn	bad bad
@sonney2k	I got some infinite recursions
 blackburn	well lets extend SWIG then
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	i will add this class nevertheless
@sonney2k	but ifdef'd

 shogun-buildbot	build #620 of libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/620  blamelist: sonne@debian.org, fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com
 n4nd0	blackburn: why does shogun-buildbot usually fail to compile the first time?
 blackburn	n4nd0: he doesn't actually
 blackburn	this time he failed because of erroneous code :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: really? our fault then?
 blackburn	n4nd0: it seems you forgot to import cblas
 blackburn	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/620/steps/compile/logs/stdio
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm why does it get to compile without problems in my machine then?
@sonney2k	well it build *every* commit
@sonney2k	so if someone commits something crappy
 blackburn	n4nd0: different configuration
 blackburn	that is usual ^
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	and fixes it afterwards it will first fail and then succeed
 blackburn	sonney2k: it seems that python stuff should be elaborated more
@sonney2k	if people were using git amend to merge fixes together this wouldn't happen - but hey I don't complain
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you secured QDA with HAVE_LAPACK?
@sonney2k	yes
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: no include for lapack.h
 blackburn	probably that is the reason
 n4nd0	I see
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rdfbb2fd / (9 files in 3 dirs): add support for director kernel - http://git.io/GicbVQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think if we manage to add these directors it should be an option
 blackburn	--enable-directors or so
 pluskid	Do you have procedure to evaluate the performance of clustering result in shogun?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah yes I did implement a proof-of-concept for libedrt
 blackburn	works even faster
 blackburn	and totally flexible
 blackburn	pluskid: no you are welcome to add any to shogun/evaluation ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah - it is currently on but I certainly will add this ifdef stuff
 pluskid	blackburn: OK, I'll do that for my GSoC sample patch
 pluskid	BTW: I get a much much more simple patch
 pluskid	in your example code
 pluskid	for the matlab and octave module
 pluskid	the content in clustering_hierarchical.m is for kmeans clustering
 pluskid	while the content for  clustering_kmeans.m is for hierarchical clustering
 pluskid	It should be a simple renaming
 pluskid	but I think this should be fixed
 pluskid	:p
 blackburn	feel free to do that using pull requests
 pluskid	sure :)
 blackburn	haha we have one task that would scary any student from participating in GSoC
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/distributions/HMM.cpp there is a race condition somewhere LOL
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh, any idea to reproduce it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh better do not do that

 blackburn	hooray
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha already tried?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	n4nd0: well easy to reproduce but 5K source lines there
 blackburn	we figured it out and nothing mor
 blackburn	results with 2 threads are totally different
 blackburn	than with 1
 n4nd0	it could be useful anyway to take a look to that code for SO

 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	n4nd0: any to configure locally like in buildbot so I'll be sure what compiles here will do it there?
 n4nd0	blackburn: or any way to test it at least
 blackburn	should be a way, but I don't know exactly
 n4nd0	mmm ok
 n4nd0	so include lapack.h in QDA.h should get rid of that
 blackburn	if my guess is right
 gsomix	hi
 gsomix	blackburn, http://pastebin.com/dBb5bb8F
 blackburn	gsomix: I see..
 gsomix	blackburn, I think problem is in the swig_typemaps file. I didn't realized something.
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'll open now a pull request with it, can you try to merge it? apart from that I've added do_free member to SGNDArray similar to the one in SGMatrix and SGVector
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'll be able to merge a little bit later
 n4nd0	blackburn: perfect ;)
 blackburn	actually when I get to my notebook :)
 gsomix	blackburn, O_o
 blackburn	gsomix: what's up?
 gsomix	blackburn, it's work, but...
 gsomix	however, for some reason installing libraries is not working properly.
 blackburn	what kind of libraries?
 gsomix	blackburn, _modshogun.
 blackburn	what is the error then?
 blackburn	it is pretty clear that typemaps get broken with python3
 blackburn	while string list is not being recognized
 gsomix	blackburn, it does not matter. I just processed incorrectly new unicode strings.
 blackburn	I can suggest you to take a look at static int is_pystring_list(PyObject* obj, int typecode)
 blackburn	swig_typemaps.i:192
 gsomix	blackburn, even last night, as it turned out.
 gsomix	blackburn, nevermind
 blackburn	I am pretty sure problem is related to such detection
 gsomix	I just could not check, because libraries are not installed.
 gsomix	but now everything is working
 blackburn	I don't get it - is it working now?
 gsomix	blackburn, there are not problems with strings.
 blackburn	is there any problem then?
 gsomix	a little

 pluskid	why java modular failed to build?
 blackburn	it was built succesfully later
 pluskid	but I failed on my local box
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	what is the error?
 pluskid	blackburn: https://gist.github.com/2204698
 pluskid	something related to SWIG?
 blackburn	well yes but could you please try to clean current build and try to build it again?
 pluskid	OK
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that maybe we have a bug in MulticlassMachine
 blackburn	n4nd0: could be
 n4nd0	blackburn: if apply is passed without arguments, it doesn't use the features that were used for training
 n4nd0	blackburn: if perfectly ok if apply is called again with apply(feats_train), the same ones used for training for example
 blackburn	ehm.. why?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't know yet ... I think I was messing up with one_vs_one but the problem is the same in one_vs_rest
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have to check whether the MulticlassMachine loses reference to CFeatures somewhere or it happens in m_machines
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	so
 blackburn	when you train()
 blackburn	and apply() it
 blackburn	what is going on?
 n4nd0	seg fault
 blackburn	oh fine
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	features is null when we do m_machines[i]->apply()
 n4nd0	so the outputs[i] are all null
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	and when we want to count the votes ... boom! :O
 n4nd0	I can work on it
 blackburn	yeaah please do
 blackburn	n4nd0: probably once it trained for some features it should init_machines_for_apply
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will take a look to it later today, have to do some other stuff now
 blackburn	ok I'll add this once I get home
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	maybe I should push then my changes in my branch and you modify it there?
 n4nd0	or are you pushing to master and later I can rebase?
 blackburn	yes I can push to master
 blackburn	so just rebase, do not fix it in your branch

 n4nd0	shogun-buildbot blames me all the time
 n4nd0	:(
 blackburn	nevermind, rather check logs
 n4nd0	how do we fix that anyway?
 blackburn	no idea I'd rather ifdef that kernel for now
 blackburn	haha 614 warnings
 n4nd0	did I hear record?
 blackburn	n4nd0: we had >2.5k once
 blackburn	when Soeren turned on doc warnings :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: shit, we have to make more efforts then :P

 harshit_	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	harshit_: hey man
 harshit_	whats going on .. are you coding any thing for shogun for now ?
 harshit_	Is there any thing you knw i can work on
 n4nd0	harshit_: so blackburn had an idea about some scripting work
 n4nd0	harshit_: to integrate tests with some datasets
 harshit_	in which language ?
 n4nd0	harshit_: idk if you would like that or you prefer we look for another thing more for C++
 n4nd0	that would probably depend more on how you want to do it but I'd that the most appropriate is to use a shell script probably
 blackburn	nice plots with iris dataset would be a nice example
 harshit_	not much experience with shell script .. but i was thinking to incorporate any nice math library other than cblas and lapack
 harshit_	will that example work, if i code it in C++
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	what do you think blackburn?
 n4nd0	do we need other math libraries?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no idea what can be useful
 harshit_	while porting code from MATLAB i found it really difficult to find functions in shogun
 blackburn	which?
 harshit_	so i think that would be useful
 n4nd0	harshit_: but those functions existed right?
 harshit_	not really
 harshit_	like for finding solutions for Ax=B
 n4nd0	mmm
 harshit_	i had to use pinv(A)*B
 harshit_	and i am working on the which part, blackburn
 n4nd0	I think that maybe cblas and lapack are a bit difficult to use
 n4nd0	but probably the stuff is there
 blackburn	no, lapack is wonderful balanced for me
 harshit_	yeah, cblas and lapack are the most powerful ones but still variety is always good
 n4nd0	yeah might be
 n4nd0	harshit_: wiking and I were talking some days ago about QP solvers
 n4nd0	now we depend on private solvers (mosek or CPLEX)
 n4nd0	would be nice to have something of that
 n4nd0	but I don't know how difficult could that be
 blackburn	to integrate shouldn't be difficult, but to use..
 harshit_	havn't had much experience with optimization, but still nice idea .i'll think about it

 n4nd0	but can it be used?
 blackburn	why not
 n4nd0	or is it left to do wrappers and stuff?

 n4nd0	at least that makes sense for me
 n4nd0	but who knows
 harshit_	feeling depressed  :(
 harshit_	didnt find anyone who could help me with my deep learning idea
 harshit_	:(
 harshit_	i think its too young too be incorporated into shogun
 harshit_	to*
 n4nd0	maybe it could be interesting to do it after GSoC or sth
 harshit_	yeah, but i thought my research and gsoc could go along with each other..
 harshit_	never mind
 n4nd0	look at this way
 n4nd0	you have the oportunity of learning other stuff
 harshit_	yeah, right ..
 harshit_	n btw do you ppl speak spanish in sweden
 harshit_	i remember you saying that you use spanish keyboard
 n4nd0	my laptop is Spanish
 n4nd0	I'm Spanish :)
 n4nd0	I speak Spanish with my Spanish friends in Sweden :P
 n4nd0	but people speaks Swedish here normally
 harshit_	okay actually i was also learning spanish :
 harshit_	its a really nice language
 harshit_	must say
 harshit_	not better than C++ though
 harshit_	:)
 n4nd0	hahaha
 n4nd0	I also prefer C++
 n4nd0	I don't like that much to speak Spanish actually
 n4nd0	just sometimes

 n4nd0	blackburn: I have just seen you pushed a change on mc :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	and changed my name on github lol
 n4nd0	blackburn: I see, surname style
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: I wonder do you know how to spell it? ;)
 n4nd0	let me try
 n4nd0	blackburn: shit, I think I am going to do it wrong
 blackburn	try ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: so I rather not to do it :P
@sonney2k	blackburn, did anyone here talk to harshit (newton svm ...)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	his code is not yet perfect but not too bad for first attempt
 blackburn	sonney2k: why do you ask?
@sonney2k	it is very inefficient at the moment (computing the whole feature matrix)
@sonney2k	but that can be fixed...
@sonney2k	he seems to know what he is doing
 blackburn	n4nd0: let me try to describe - lee-see-ts-yh-n
@sonney2k	blackburn, wasnt' he the one wanting to integrate NNs?
 n4nd0	blackburn: lisitsyn
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes deep learning
 blackburn	sonney2k: he wants still
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he was asking about it today
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you think it could be a possible project?
 blackburn	I have doubts
 blackburn	nobody asked me yet but I have doubts :D
 n4nd0	about what?
 blackburn	deep learning
 n4nd0	about the project you mean in deep learning?
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	what doubts?
@sonney2k	we have no mentor for that ...
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	exactly
 n4nd0	aham I see
 blackburn	I am not an expert in anything
 blackburn	and sonney2k is probably not an expert in deep learning
 blackburn	so hard to decide
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I remember that someone suggested in the mailing list that it was not required to have a mentor to carry out the project
 n4nd0	a mentor specialized in the topic
 n4nd0	sorry
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah gunnar did
@sonney2k	(the shoGUN gunnar )
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you agree?
@sonney2k	problem is that this is only true if we know a high quality C/C++ impl. of deep learning stuff
@sonney2k	which would merely need porting/shogun integration
@sonney2k	I know that real experts are the people doing lush and torch5
 blackburn	I can hardly imagine yann lecun mentoring for us
@sonney2k	but lush is some lisp dialect stuff
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	and ronan collobert (torch main author) comes up with torch6 soon I guess :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw we have no lisp typemaps! ;)
@sonney2k	luckily :D
 blackburn	gsomix: let you implement it ;)
 blackburn	to get sonney2k feeling not so lucky
 gsomix	blackburn, L??P?
@sonney2k	if we want deep learning in shogun I think I should talk to some big shots and find someone who wants to help us
 blackburn	gsomix: yeah!
@sonney2k	LUCP :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: you got it right!
 blackburn	sonney2k: try if you have time for that
@sonney2k	I cannot write the pppp - i-i
 gsomix	sonney2k, check mail, please
@sonney2k	shogun seriously lacks boosting algortihsm, decision trees and deep learning (even when all projects a done after this gsoc)
 blackburn	sonney2k: decision trees is painful thing
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what about SO, isn't that important?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah but you said you will do it this gsoc - right ?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but people *love* trees
 blackburn	haha
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :) that's what I wish
 blackburn	sonney2k: most painful is to design it properly
 blackburn	I would rather jump out of the window :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, anyway what I am saying is that harshit could do a good job - not sure if he wants to do sth else (like trees :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: lets see it is unclear for me yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah for me it is also not clear - lets see how he reacts to my (many!) comments
@sonney2k	gsomix, no worries about incomplete patches (as long as they don't break python2 support)
 blackburn	he asked to review his code
 blackburn	many times actually
 n4nd0	sonney2k: this afternoon he asked for something to work on so I think it could be ok another topic
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok
 blackburn	I just did not want to do it hahah
 n4nd0	we better suggest him next time in any case
@sonney2k	blackburn, I only saw his pull request 2 days ago? anyway I did now more or less
 blackburn	sonney2k: well you are an svm expert so let you review such things
 blackburn	;)
@sonney2k	I have too many comments so I need him to answer first before digging deeper
@sonney2k	blackburn, well he said that the matlab code and his impl. of newton svm give the same result
 blackburn	for 5 feature vectors
 blackburn	that can be a problem..
@sonney2k	good enough for me :)
 blackburn	thanks google for grouping emails
@sonney2k	anyway the C++ code is too memory demanding / slow currently
 blackburn	I just received a bunch of your comments
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok - I have no idea what timezone he is in - lets see if we find sth we can mentor...
 blackburn	gsomix: check directorkernel, that's the thing I have described you earlier
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am pretty sure he +4-5 from you
 n4nd0	n4nd0: he is Indian, I normally speak with him in the mornings ... I quite not remember meeting him at this time
 blackburn	n4nd0: you always highlight yourself ;)
 blackburn	how can it be?
 n4nd0	fuck!! I have a problem with that
 n4nd0	I am an egocentric :P
 blackburn	lol
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he is Indian, I normally speak with him in the mornings ... I quite not remember meeting him at this time
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we all are
 n4nd0	ok, you got it :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: you think so? I shouldn't worry about that then
* sonney2k cares most (after shogun code quality) about his hairstyle, taint, muscles :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw are you well again?
@sonney2k	I would wish
 blackburn	but not?
@sonney2k	must be the code quality I was seeing :D
@sonney2k	...and am producing
@sonney2k	blackburn, we really need the tests we have in python also in other languages
@sonney2k	this legacy test suite is a pain in the ....
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but it turned to be useful
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but the example based tests have higher coverage... but are not available in all languages yet
@sonney2k	only python_{static,modular}
@sonney2k	so much easier to maintain
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have doubts it has high coverage..
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw not sure if you have seem it - the comments you wrote in your example - I moved them to descriptions (examples have no documentation in the file - these are all separate)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, the rationale is: if someone converts your example to e.g. octave_modular then the same description will be prepended
@sonney2k	blackburn, 170 tests much higher then we have in the old at least
@sonney2k	(for python modular only...)
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh March, 27 is the day I talked to you for the first time :D
 gsomix	blackburn, do you mean director classes?
 blackburn	gsomix: yeaahh I hope they would work someday
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I understand, ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah
 n4nd0	I should do the doc for QDA by the way, I think I still have a TODO there :O
 gsomix	blackburn, ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem is they should be updated and cleaned
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes please
@sonney2k	blackburn, the problem is we don't run them by default
 blackburn	in means of quantity it covers more things for sure
@sonney2k	if we would we would see any breakage when it appears and they would be kept up to date
@sonney2k	and it is sooo easy to update them
@sonney2k	just run generator.py <example_name>
 blackburn	we will see a lot of breakages next months
@sonney2k	and commti
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you think so? I am not aware of changes like we had with SGVector etc
@sonney2k	for this gsoc at least
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I am pretty sure, with labels subclassing at least
@sonney2k	only additions...
@sonney2k	ahh yes
@sonney2k	and actually SGVector refcounting :)
 blackburn	features subclassing
@sonney2k	features subclassign?
 blackburn	probably..
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah I had one idea before
 blackburn	do you think it can be useful to add list of strings into the features
 blackburn	to store feature vector names
 blackburn	sonney2k: new features will come with latent models
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is probably useful but the overhead...
 blackburn	if it is needed
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the overhead?
@sonney2k	we used to have 0 byte overhead
 blackburn	it can be optional
@sonney2k	I mean SGVector used to be ptr + len
 blackburn	I can't agree with you
 blackburn	serialization and migrations stuff
 blackburn	have a lot of overhead
 n4nd0	btw what about this guy who asked about reference counting for SGVector?
@sonney2k	serailization /migration are not in sgvector/matrix
 blackburn	sonney2k: but in features
 blackburn	and other classes
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but that is just once for whole feature matrix
@sonney2k	not per feature / feature vector
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am just browsing the list...
 blackburn	I can't see extra overhead there
 n4nd0	sonney2k: cool, sorry I rushed
 blackburn	if list of names is provided - it stores this list
 blackburn	if not - no overhead at all
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you have an SGVector of bytes and each dim is described there?
 blackburn	one pointer
@sonney2k	huge overhead
 blackburn	noo
 blackburn	I did not suggest this crazy way of describing features
 blackburn	just optional list of names in CFeatures*
 blackburn	"1.png" "2.png" "3.png" "4.png"
 blackburn	sonney2k: did you suggest to Evan to implement it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah sure no problem with that (even for dims then - but not sure if this is so useful...)
@sonney2k	dammed
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	bye
 blackburn	n4nd0: is o-v-o stuff ready?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have not tested it yet with your last commit
 blackburn	ok!
 n4nd0	blackburn: but classification is ready, yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: the set_subset part for kernel machines is still missing though
 blackburn	ah ok I'll implement it
 n4nd0	as you wish, I will test the classify o-v-o and commit it soon
 blackburn	n4nd0: you already have contibuted with 1.7k LoC
 blackburn	and gsomix with 1.9k LoC
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh, is that good?
 n4nd0	I use lot of spacing :P
 blackburn	n4nd0: no idea I am just clicking buttons on github
@sonney2k	n4nd0, comments are even better :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I realized I have not commented the code that much :(
 n4nd0	I feel bad about that

 blackburn	sonney2k: are you back? ;)
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well good code doesn't need comments...
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen list of scikits gsoc topics?
 blackburn	https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/A-list-of-topics-for-a-google-summer-of-code-%28gsoc%29-2012
@sonney2k	blackburn, the situation relaxed
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I don't dare to say that mine's such a good code
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's fine ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: most interesting thing is they keep 'possible candidate' there
@sonney2k	blackburn, I didn't see these before - not a lot though?
@sonney2k	well every highly interested student knows that n4nd0 is possible candidate for SO, gsomix for accessibility, wiking for latent svm
@sonney2k	no idea about others
 n4nd0	blackburn for multitask! :)
 blackburn	hah
@sonney2k	ahh yes ;)
* sonney2k goes back answering that email
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw regarding students - it also depends on how many slots we get. last year we had 5 but I would not expect we get much more than that if at all...)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope more..
 blackburn	sonney2k: remember we have heiko
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah ... and lot of people are starting to be around here ... is going to be difficult to get a place there
 blackburn	I really hope they would give 6-7
@sonney2k	it is not that difficult ... just contribute a lot before gsoc even starts (potentially even start with `your' project) and you are in.
@sonney2k	last year heiko and blackburn where students like this (submitting patches like crazy before gsoc did start)...
@sonney2k	the other 3 submitted convincing patches too - but by far not so many

@sonney2k	n4nd0, blackburn_ - can I get your opinion on that reference counting thing and SGVector  etc business?
@sonney2k	we basically need reference counts even for the simple storage container SGVector / SGMatrix etc
-!- blackburn [5bde8018@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.222.128.24] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	we realized that we are running into trouble without
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think that it would be very interesting to have it
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> n4nd0, blackburn - can I get your opinion on that reference counting thing and SGVector  etc business?
 blackburn	damn are you talking only when I get disconnected?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so we have it currently for SGObject
@sonney2k	one can do SG_REF / SG_UNREF and all good
-!- blackburn_ [5bde8018@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.222.128.24] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
@sonney2k	now with SGVector we were always passing around copies
@sonney2k	e.g. return SGVector<flaot64_t>(xxx)
@sonney2k	that is ptr + associated length
@sonney2k	now if we add more fields overhead will kill performance
@sonney2k	after all we do this *everywhere*
@sonney2k	in learning algorithms etc
 n4nd0	I understand
@sonney2k	so even a inc_ref() is significant overhead
@sonney2k	and having a common base class for reference counts will create even more overhead (vtable...)
@sonney2k	so the question is what we can do about it (or should)
 n4nd0	but even if this inc_ref() and the reference counts will increase overhead
 n4nd0	isn't better than working with the copies?

 blackburn	ok stable connection finally
 blackburn	changed room :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: still here?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok so you are +1 for using references?
@sonney2k	so we return SGVector<float64_t>& ?
 n4nd0	I think so
 n4nd0	from my point of view it is also more intuitive
@sonney2k	and then add whatever we want, blackburns dimnames, derivative class etc
 blackburn	I do not think we should count references of vectors..
 n4nd0	but that is something more personal I guess
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have to
 n4nd0	blackburn: why?
 blackburn	what is the motivation?
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is messy with this do_free business - one never knows if this vector is still in use by someone
 blackburn	where in code it becomes a problem?
@sonney2k	blackburn, several algos fetch vectors and we never know who should free it
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't have a concrete example but any place where we don't have a sole owner of the vector
@sonney2k	(or matrix / string list)
 blackburn	it is pretty intrusive change
 blackburn	we shall to think about its pros and cons..
@sonney2k	so I like Evan Shelhamer's suggestion with the base class
@sonney2k	blackburn, exactly - that is why I ask you both
 blackburn	for me access/free approach is ok
 blackburn	but if there is any example of something not possible with it - yeah we should change it then
@sonney2k	for me no longer - it is too messy
@sonney2k	I never know if I can SG_FREE the vector or not (and I wrote that code...)
 n4nd0	I think that it gets a bit difficult to know that, exactly
 n4nd0	I also assumed that it was lack of practice though ...
@sonney2k	blackburn, for example consider CLabels having an SGVector internally and passing it to the outside
 blackburn	actually we can avoid reference counting and just use it as object
 blackburn	and add free stuff to destructor
@sonney2k	blackburn, but who frees it then?
 blackburn	destructor
@sonney2k	blackburn, who calls delete then :D
 blackburn	scope
 n4nd0	wouldn't that increase the calls to delete around the code?
 blackburn	{
 blackburn	...
 blackburn	SGVector<float64_t> vector();
 blackburn	...
 blackburn	}
 n4nd0	isn't that a limitation?
 blackburn	well it won't be deleted if we return it
 blackburn	or pass a reference to other function
@sonney2k	blackburn, except that if vecto is passed to the outside it might get deleted because the original object is gone
 n4nd0	it may be interesting to destroy the objects before the end of the scope
 n4nd0	yeah, that is even a bigger limitation I guess
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 blackburn	sonney2k: that shouldn't happen, are you sure?
@sonney2k	blackburn, CLabels
@sonney2k	someone calls get_labels and gets the vector
@sonney2k	then the CLabels object is deleted
 blackburn	ah in that mean
@sonney2k	bumm
 blackburn	I forgot that is shared
 blackburn	ok then
@sonney2k	question is how expensive this is
-!- prm [~prm@115.248.130.148] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@sonney2k	not sure if we can do it the SGObject way
 blackburn	I actually wish we could map memory at least for python
 n4nd0	I don't really see that point, why the reference counting can increase overhead that much?
 blackburn	without copying it in in/out typemaps
@sonney2k	blackburn, different issue
 blackburn	yes but much more important (for me)
-!- prm [~prm@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	I mean SGVector stuff works OK for now :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, at least currently we check for NULL ptrs etc and deriving from some class with potentially virtual functions will create a vtable for that class
 blackburn	sonney2k: I believe you care about it too much
 n4nd0	sonney2k: oh I see, I clearly understimated this problem
 blackburn	passing vectors is occured only a few times
 blackburn	there can't be such huge overhead
@sonney2k	blackburn, well what we could do for 0 overhead cases is pass around ptr / len directly (if needed)
-!- prm [~prm@115.248.130.148] has quit [Client Quit]
@sonney2k	so I am very much in favor of having that ref counting across SGObject/SGVector/SG*
@sonney2k	with some common base class
 blackburn	I'm ok with it
@sonney2k	*but* we need a common way of passing SGVector / SGObject around
@sonney2k	SGObject's are passed around as ptr's
@sonney2k	so I we should pass SGVectors as pointers too
-!- makokal [~makokal@212.201.44.246] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	that would mean a lot of work possibly
@sonney2k	yeah - the alternative is to have it inconsistent for now and maybe later even change SGObject's to not pass pointers but references?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, blackburn http://pastebin.com/Gb2RMfPH latest build. I continue to work on it.
 blackburn	sonney2k: it seems we would have to try
@sonney2k	gsomix, that is python3 already?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. there are some small problems.
@sonney2k	blackburn, so with references first?
 blackburn	gsomix: please install pickle and scipy
 blackburn	sonney2k: I like references mostly
 gsomix	blackburn, ok
 blackburn	but it is obvious that any experiments should be done in a separate branch
@sonney2k	gsomix, line 178 - python3 converts int's to float when x/2 returns a float
@sonney2k	so you just need to cast to int
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah one could do a+b for SGVector objects
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you ever seen accurate derivation of crammer-singer formulation?
@sonney2k	so that is nice
 blackburn	dual task
 blackburn	sorry
 blackburn	dual task of C-S
@sonney2k	blackburn, derivation of dual starting from primal?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	no - but I guess it is easy
 gsomix	sonney2k, thx
 gsomix	sonney2k, also I know how to fix the problem "TypeError" in kernel_weighted_degree_position_string_modular.py
 blackburn	sonney2k: have time to help? ;)
@sonney2k	gsomix, you don't have lzo installed
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am for real actually :)
