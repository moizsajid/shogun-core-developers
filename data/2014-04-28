 lambday	wiking: there?
 lambday	lisitsyn: there?
 lisitsyn	lambday: yeah
 lambday	lisitsyn: hey bugging you with a problem
 lisitsyn	sure
 lisitsyn	lambday: what's up?
 lambday	lisitsyn: I updated a class and needed to update the data
 lambday	lisitsyn: so I ran generator.py and have all python2-tests related data changed
 lisitsyn	alright
 lambday	but travis fails for python3
 lambday	so I tried configuring with python3
 lambday	and then ran generator.py
 lambday	still no change
 lambday	what am I missing?
 lambday	lisitsyn: :(
 lisitsyn	lambday: what tests are failing?
 lambday	lisitsyn: The following tests FAILED: 113 - integration-python_modular-tester-mkl_binclass_modular (Failed) 215 - integration-python_modular-tester-classifier_custom_kernel_modular (Failed) 229 - integration-python_modular-tester-kernel_custom_modular (Failed) 262 - integration-python_modular-tester-kernel_combined_custom_poly_modular (Failed)
 lambday	lisitsyn: these are the tests I changed python2-tests data for
 lambday	this is due to an added parameter is_symmetric in CCustomKernel
 lambday	but when I do git diff in shogun/data, I find no change for these in python3-tests/ dir
 lambday	lisitsyn: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/23954392
 lisitsyn	lambday: okay I got it though don't know why it is that
 lambday	lisitsyn: what should I have done if I wanted to update testsuite data for python3?
 lisitsyn	lambday: well configure for python3 and use python3 with generator
 lisitsyn	this should be enough
 lambday	lisitsyn: well, there's a problem - running python3 generator.py gives me errors
 lisitsyn	lambday: what errors?
 lambday	lisitsyn: dynamic module does not define init function (PyInit__modshogun)
 lambday	lisitsyn: build was successful and I did make install as well
 lambday	may be I don't have pythonpath set for python3? :/
 lisitsyn	lambday: well I guess that's the thing
 lisitsyn	if you run generator with your default python
 lisitsyn	you use 2.7 thing I guess
 lambday	yep
 lambday	alright so that's the error
 lisitsyn	maybe it makes sense to clean these things
 lisitsyn	and then reinstall
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah - messed up there quite a bit
 lambday	lisitsyn: after setting pythonpath for python3, generator.py seems to run with python3
 lambday	lisitsyn: ..aaaaaaand git diff works as well
 lambday	lisitsyn: thanks man! :d
 lisitsyn	lambday: :) np
 lambday	lisitsyn: sending data PR
 lisitsyn	I can merge it
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah please :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: I'll ping you here when I send
 lambday	in 5 mins
 lisitsyn	cool thanks lambday
 lambday	thanks to you man!

 lambday	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data/pull/47
 lisitsyn	lambday: hmm it says there are some conflicts
 lambday	lisitsyn: conflicts?
 lisitsyn	We can't automatically merge this pull request.Use the command line to resolve conflicts before continuing.
 lisitsyn	lambday: is it rebased?
 lambday	lisitsyn: argh.. no! :(
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah rebasing fails
 lisitsyn	lambday: just reset to head
 lisitsyn	and regenerate
 lisitsyn	and commit again
 lambday	lisitsyn: you mean git reset --hard HEAD
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lambday	lisitsyn: committed. now do I just push or rebase with upstream master or so?
 lambday	lisitsyn: I am on a detached head right now
 lambday	in data/
 lisitsyn	hmm why it is detached head?
 lambday	lisitsyn: its because earlier rebase failed - so, git rebase --continue first, right?
 lisitsyn	uhmm
 lisitsyn	I'd expect you get back on master branch
 lambday	lisitsyn: alright - then repeat the process - reset to head, regenerate, commit - and push
 lambday	right?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lambday	lisitsyn: updated. could you please check if there still is some conflicts?
 lambday	lisitsyn: or shall I check locally by trying to rebase first
 lisitsyn	lambday: hmm this PR is still conflicting
 lambday	err
