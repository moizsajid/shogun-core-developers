 sanuj	B-ZDM-G, is this the correct way to compare storage?

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: jo
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: remove the aligned again?
@HeikoS	back in 3 mins
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: it is giving all the meta example errors. I just removed the ones in SGVector
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: I was trying to test is at local. But it seems the linalg branch gives me other trouble to build the meta examples
@HeikoS	re
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: meta examples?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I dont understand arent they kind of unrelated?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: btw pls remember to send a daily update from now on, as mentioned in email
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: also, do you have the revised timeline somehwere?
@HeikoS	sanuj: hi! revised timeline? :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, no :/
 sanuj	need to talk to sergey about it
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Yep I removed the other stuff
 sanuj	i have no idea how much time plugins will take
@HeikoS	sanuj: more that we have
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: I sent an update 12h ago
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ah ok
@HeikoS	sorry :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: you can already structure things yourself
 sanuj	HeikoS, and then we have to make other classes in shogun support tags as well
@HeikoS	and based on how much time it took, you can estimate whats is realistic
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: it's okay. I think only wiking was here ..
@HeikoS	sanuj: for plugins, we could think about only having a prototype maybe
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: you sent to IRC?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: can you from now on send them to rahul, wiking, me via email daily?
@HeikoS	or the list
@HeikoS	stand up, just via email
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: yep. np!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: thanks, helps a lot in keeping things together!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and the timeline is where?
 sanuj	HeikoS, so a working prototype for plugin architecture
@HeikoS	sanuj: yeah but this should contain like 15 points
 sanuj	then when we migrate classes to plugins, also take care of tags
@HeikoS	sanuj: details!
@HeikoS	sanuj: getting that tags merged and working in all of shogun should be another focus point
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eozTFX_mgKx3eXQfQnP07Rxi8GYKfGYdu_qvGpLRnjw/edit?usp=sharing
@HeikoS	sanuj: and then some base class structure
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: thanks!
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: I dont have details for cereal yet..
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: suggestion:
@HeikoS	shorten the lnalg stuff. We are almost done and all we now need is to refactor the existing implementations to the new interface, that should only take a week
@HeikoS	and then a week clean up maybe max
@HeikoS	Then, cerealk
@HeikoS	we should try to free as much time as possible for that
@HeikoS	so I would prefer to get the linalg done asap
@HeikoS	most work is done there anyways
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: think that is good
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and we definitely want the cereal stuff to work
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: smart pointer can go I think, or optional, I dont think it is realistic
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure thx. I already have some linalg methods working [at local] now and I'll pull once the current patch is merged
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'll update my timeline tonight
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: but good otherwise
 sanuj	and then we can refine it
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: great, then you can send patches of the methods + tests one by one
@HeikoS	should be quick
@HeikoS	can send multiple at once actually, as they dont overlap
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool!
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: yep. The matrix - should they be in GPUMemory or I should rename it to GPUMemoryVectorBlabla..?
 OXPHOS	and have a separate file for GPUMemoryMatrix?
 shogun-buildbot	build #2909 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed examples and unit tests]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2909  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, OXPHOS <engelzora@gmail.com>
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I think you can have a new file for matrix
@HeikoS	or wai
@HeikoS	t
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: the errors with align: http://pastebin.com/4EUT3CXH
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I think you can re-use the GPUMemoryBase  class for matrix
@HeikoS	just rename the clone method
@HeikoS	Then GPUMemoryVectorViennaCL
@HeikoS	GPUMemoryMatrixViannaCL
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: you need to adjust the pointers in the methods a bit, so that matrix and vector cannot be mixed
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: I see
@wiking	HeikoS: we have another problem
@wiking	/home/buildslave/deb3_-_modular_interfaces/build/build/examples/meta/java/regression/kernel_ridge_regression.java:66: error: cannot find symbol
@wiking	__sg_storage.append_wrapped(width, "width");
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2909/steps/examples%20and%20unit%20tests/logs/stdio
 sanuj	HeikoS, for this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3246
 sanuj	where can i find the csharp listing
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah I wonder where that is coming from
 sanuj	HeikoS, or shall i just try changing the name of 'params'
@HeikoS	I checked the last commit ....
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: see my comments in the linalg PR
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont get why this is even there for non cpp, serialization should only happen for cpp examples
@HeikoS	mist have been some latest patch, checking
@wiking	HeikoS: no the problem is that modular stuff have not been executed for a longer time now
@wiking	because we had a failing bug on viennacl build
@wiking	for some time
@wiking	if there's an error
@wiking	the modular stuff are not being built
@HeikoS	wiking: I see
@HeikoS	wiking: but this serialization stuff
@HeikoS	should only happen for cpp
@HeikoS	wiking: as not supported for targets other than cpp
@HeikoS	this error above is missing typemap for String in java
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :feature/kernel_exp_family * ee92d3f / src/shogun/distributions/kernel_exp_family/KernelExpFamilyNystromH.h: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/ee92d3f3f3841f05e1bad7130fcd4e5bad79b593
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: change to low memory mode by default
@HeikoS	wiking: btw just discussed to prototype a tensorflow integration for shogun
@HeikoS	just to see ho that would go
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: you mean like LinalgBackendBase-LinalgBackendGPUBase-LinalgBackendGPUViennaCL?
 OXPHOS	and I assume LinalgBackendGPUBase looks almost the same as LinalgBackendBase, with only pure virtual methods?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: even simpler
@HeikoS	LinalgBackendGPUBase inherits from the existing base
@HeikoS	just adds the GPU methods
@HeikoS	so everything is a LinalgBackendBase
@HeikoS	but GPU is more specific
 OXPHOS	so just the transfer methods
@HeikoS	with these purely virtual methods
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	to enfore GPU backends implementing them first
 OXPHOS	and the purely virtual - is current way {SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED} pure virtual? Because I have tried =0 and it didn't work for macro
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: pure virtual means that if you dont implement the method then you get a compile error
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: should work with macro
 OXPHOS	HeikoS:#define BACKEND_GENERIC_DOT(Type) \ virtual Type dot(const SGVector<Type>&, const SGVector<Type>&) const = 0;\
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: oops it works now. sry.
