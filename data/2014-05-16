 sonne|work	pickle27f: can you upload a fixed website?
 pickle27f	I pushed the fix for the css
 pickle27f	I don't know what text is supposed to be there
 pickle27f	besser82, you around?
 pickle27f	kislay, has a PR that adds some stuff to cmake
@besser82	pickle27f, yo!
@besser82	pickle27f, which one?
 pickle27f	besser82, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2221#issuecomment-43144697
@besser82	pickle27f, k, thx! ^^
 pickle27f	np thanks for taking a look!
@besser82	pickle27f, np  =)
 pickle27f	sonne|work, what should the text be?
 sonne|work	pickle27f: there is some text in the .html
 sonne|work	just flickering and going away
 sonne|work	I guess that but fernando would know
 pickle27f	its loading fine for me
 pickle27f	sonne|work, http://monosnap.com/image/k8SgLMgnkTNBYjzUVf0s6ykCl4uX9b here is what I see
@besser82	pickle27f, just commented on the PR
 pickle27f	awesome thanks!
 pickle27f	I'll have kislay address your comments and then anyone can merge it
@besser82	pickle27f, allrighty! thx!  Lemme know, when it's ready.  I'll have another look then && merge
 pickle27f	kk!
@besser82	pickle27f, btw. you did do anything related to NLP?
 pickle27f	can't say I have
@besser82	pickle27f, kk
@besser82	pickle27f, I'm just looking for someone, who can show me how to conv LDA-model into lLDA / sLDA...
@besser82	and clarify the most signficant differences...
@besser82	read lots of papers but I'm not smarter than before  :(
@besser82	just eye-sore :(
 sonne|work	pickle27f: c'mon look at the source code
@besser82	sonne|work, hey!
@besser82	sonne|work, can you tell me the significant difference between lLDA and sLDA?
 pickle27f	sonne|work, pooh how did I mess that before ...
@besser82	and possibly MedLDA?
 pickle27f	I'll have to fix that when I get home later slash maybe tomorrow but yeah I'll push something up
 kislay	pickle27f, see if it's okay. I have removed the system include for opencv from CMakeLists.txt
 pickle27f	kislay, looks good and it still works right? - did you try a clean build?
 kislay	pickle27f, yeah! np with that!
 pickle27f	great!
 pickle27f	besser82, I think we are good now!
 pickle27f	just waiting on travis
@besser82	pickle27f, lgtm  ;)  will merge after travis run is clean
@besser82	kislay, could you remove the mentioned cluttering whitespace, too?
@besser82	kislay, plz...
 kislay	besser82, sure sure.
@besser82	kislay, fine  =)  let's w8 on travis then

 pickle27f	who do kislay and I talk to about getting an OpenCV build bot? slash can we just add to Travis?
 kislay	yeah. wo do we talk :)
 pickle27f	I think we can add to Travis our selves if you want to look into that - you'll need to edit the travis.yml file in the repo
 pickle27f	I don't know about the other bots
 pickle27f	slash I don't even know how or who configures those

 abinash_panda	thoralf: Hi !
 thoralf	Yo.
 thoralf	Hey :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: So, I was going through the implementation of CMulticlassModel for getting to know more about the implementation of get_joint_feature_vector method.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Do the implementation of get_joint_feature_vector would be somewhat like this is CMultilabelModel ?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Of course - because get_joint_feature_vector() is very central in defining a structured model.
 thoralf	We're interested in very efficient implementation, so suggestions are welcome.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Ok.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Any ideas?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I was going through the paper http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/TsochantaridisJHA05.pdf for getting to know more about joint feature map.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: It has some special cases of structured output learning as examples.
 thoralf	Yeah, this paper is great.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: So, I what I think that the implementation of get_joint_feature_vector() would be the tensor product of input and output labels. Right ?
 thoralf	tensor product of label-vector and feature-vector, but yes.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah. I meant the same.
 thoralf	Okay :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Now, regarding the argmax function.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I am still confused. Could you please help me out
 thoralf	Shoot. :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: You have mentioned in the mail, for the initial implementation we can treat the labels independently.
 thoralf	Yes.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I am still unable to understand its implementation.
 thoralf	Hmm.  Okay.
 thoralf	Imagine you have one input vector and want to predict a binary label vector.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Ok
 thoralf	Let's say 3 labels, like (0,0,1)
 abinash_panda	Ok
 thoralf	For one input x you have 8 possible outputs (000), (001), (010), ..., (111).  You have a scoring function f(x,y) which tells you a score for (input, possible outputs)... and you want to find the "best" output labeling.
 thoralf	best means, highest score.
 thoralf	But you don't want to "brute force" them.
 thoralf	You want some "clever" decoding.
 thoralf	Something that is cheaper than trying all 2^n combinations.
 thoralf	And that has to be implemented in argmax.
 thoralf	"Find the best labeling"
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 thoralf	Do you have an idea how to implement this multilabel stuff with binary classifiers?
 abinash_panda	We can use binary relevance method, training one binary classifier for each label. Right?
 thoralf	Yes.
 thoralf	And then we ask the i-th classifier for the i-th label.
 thoralf	The cost is linear in the number of labels, which is totally fine. :)
 abinash_panda	Ok. So what I think that we can implement the same in the argmax function.
 thoralf	Exact.
 thoralf	But instead of training n classifiers, we train one classifier over the joint-feature-space.
 thoralf	You know what I mean?
-!- pickle27f [~pickle27@216.191.231.218] has quit [Quit: This computer has gone to sleep]
 abinash_panda	Yeah. We would be training only one classifier.
 thoralf	Then you probably know how to transform label-vector and feature-vector to form the joint-feature-vector?
 thoralf	Sorry for asking dumb questions.  I'm trying cover all possible problems. ;)
 abinash_panda	In the argmax method, for N labels we can go for computing the argmax N number of times and would return only those labels for whose the output is 1.
 abinash_panda	Am I able to make myself clear
 thoralf	Yeah, I think so.
 abinash_panda	Ok. :)
 thoralf	It's even easier: Output only labels which decision value is positive.
 abinash_panda	Yeah, thats better :)
 thoralf	">= 0" for true, "< 0" for false.
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 thoralf	Btw., if you like to, you can also implement a multilabel class which uses N independent binary SVMs.  This sounds strange, but you can learn them all in parallel. :)
 abinash_panda	Yeah, sure. I would try to implement it.
 thoralf	You get parallel training on many cores for free.
 thoralf	Who many cores does your biggest computer have? ;)
* thoralf was able to train multilabel with 1000 classes on a weekend.
 abinash_panda	Currently, my computer have 4 cores ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: On how many cores you have implemented this multilabel classification?
 thoralf	Well, the computer had 8 cores (with hyperthreading it was 16 threads)
 thoralf	So scaling by factor 16 for free.
 thoralf	No worrying about how to parallelize SVM solvers.
