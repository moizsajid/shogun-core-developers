@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, does it support slicing already?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: block
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aah true
@iglesiasg	I have seen it in this cheatsheet for Matlab users
 thoralf	wiking: Im sometimes getting "/usr/bin/ld: can not read symbols: File truncated" when building shogun.
 thoralf	wiking: Seems that ld isn't finished when it tries to build the examples or tests.
@wiking	HeikoS: yes indeed
 thoralf	wiking: Does not happen all the time, but when setting high number with -j.
@wiking	thoralf: mmmm i wonder... this should be handled by cmake
@wiking	thoralf: as i added a dependency to libshogun for building examples and unit tests
@wiking	btw is Stack thread safe ? :)
 thoralf	wiking: Strange.
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@178.45.32.127] has joined #shogun
@wiking	thoralf: yeah i think this is something do with cmake unfortunately
@wiking	thoralf: it should wait until the building of libshogun is finished
 thoralf	wiking: But it works when re-running make in the build dir, so the hotfix is easy. ;)
 thoralf	wiking: What I did before: I changed a class, ran "make" in a clean build dir, but c++ found out there is a (trivial) syntax error.  I fixed it without deleting the build dir an reran make, then the ld error appeared.  Running make a second time fixed it.
 thoralf	wiking: Maybe that helps?
@wiking	where should we implement these (or where should it be placed in the shogun struct): http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ensemble_learning#Ensemble_combination_rules
@wiking	HeikoS: lisitsyn iglesiasg ^
@wiking	thoralf: no idea :(
@iglesiasg	wiking, classifier?
@iglesiasg	wiking, LPBoost is there at least
 thoralf	wiking: Oh, it apparently happened in the unit tests: make[1]: *** [tests/unit/CMakeFiles/shogun-unit-test.dir/all] Error 2
@wiking	iglesiasg: well it'd really just a class that takes a set of labels or a matrix and runs the voting on it
@wiking	i mean it wouldn't be actually a classifier :)
@wiking	in the classical sense
 thoralf	wiking: It failed shortly after printing that it now links: libgtest_main.a, libgmock_main.a, libgtest.a, libgmock.a (and some other tests)
 thoralf	wiking: Some dependencies between them?
@wiking	thoralf: tests/unit/cmakelists.txt
@wiking	add_dependencies(shogun-unit-test gmock gtest)
@wiking	target_link_libraries(shogun-unit-test shogun gmock gtest)
@wiking	afaik target_link_libraries does define a dependency
@wiking	but try adding shogun to add_dependencies as well
 thoralf	wiking: FYI: Digging in the make output I found that "Linking CXX executable shogun-unit-test" never returned.  And that make tried to link gmock/gtest *after* shogun-unit-test.
 thoralf	wiking: libshogun has already been finished then.
 lisitsyn	wiking: ensemble! :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: okey! :) currently BaggingMachine is about to be added to machine... should we change that as well/ :P
 lisitsyn	begging machine
 lisitsyn	:D

 lisitsyn	A.block(1,1,5,5).array() = 3;
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes that is fine
@HeikoS	but A=B(3:4,5:7) doesnt work
@HeikoS	such that modifying A changes B
 lisitsyn	why?
 lisitsyn	A.noalign() = B.block(3,5,1,2);
 lisitsyn	sth like that
@HeikoS	but in my case, A and B point to the same memory
@HeikoS	just different elements
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but doesnt really matter for now, and also eigen is a better place for this than shogun
 thoralf	wiking: I built shogun with -DENABLE_TESTING=ON, but when calling "make test" I'm getting warnings for each example.
 thoralf	Could not find executable ./shogun-github/build/examples/undocumented/libshogun/so_factorgraph
 thoralf	And "Looked in the following places:" followed by a long list of directories
 thoralf	wiking: My cmake call was: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DTRACE_MEMORY_ALLOCS=OFF ..
 thoralf	wiking: Oh.  I was typing "make shogun" instead of "make all" - give me a second, trying this first.

@sonney2k	thoralf, the thing with the bias term and liblinear is that it used to use a w vector of size dim+1
 thoralf	sonney2k: I know.
@sonney2k	thoralf, when the bias is enabled - so one dim in w is b
@sonney2k	thoralf, however we changed all of liblinear to explicitly work with a separate b
@sonney2k	well we == I
 thoralf	sonney2k: Anyway, there is an off-by-one in streaming/sparse_features which only happens when learning without bias.
 thoralf	sonney2k: When learning with bias, then the +1 saves you from segfaults. ;)

 thoralf	sonney2k: liblinear allocates weights with dim/dim+1 depending on the bias setting.  When computing dense_dot() with streaming/sparse_features returns, then sparse_features telling dimensionality is $n$, but the max feature index is also $n$, which leads dense_dot to read excess w's last element.
@wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll give u a link for the dmg
 thoralf	wiking: I cannot run tests for python_modular on my machine.  It's always complaining about "ImportError: No module named shogun.XXX"
 thoralf	wiking: I'm not supposed to "make install" first?
@wiking	thoralf: yes
@wiking	thoralf: as .py files are not populated unders <pythonlibpath>/shogun/...
 thoralf	wiking: Can I set the install path to somewhere relative to build/? ;)

 thoralf	The example python_modular/features_io_modular.py (line 25) breaks because something is wrong with examples/undocumented/python_modular/fm_train_sparsereal.bin, but I can't tell what exactly.
@wiking	thoralf: there's a cmake faq ;)
 thoralf	It's loaded from SparseRealFeatures(fm_train_real.dat) and then saved back to disk.
 thoralf	wiking: Grr.
 thoralf	wiking: It's really too much pain for just fixing a bug and contributing a patch.
 thoralf	I know it's not your fault, but it's still too complicated. ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: currently using virutalenv
@HeikoS	thats soo cool
 thoralf	HeikoS: Yeah, it's great.
@HeikoS	thoralf: best thing is the freeze option
@HeikoS	so I can just install my stuff along the cluster
 thoralf	HeikoS: What's that?
 thoralf	Oh.
 thoralf	Really?
@HeikoS	you can save the installed packages
@HeikoS	and then you get a text file which you can use on other machines to reproduce the env
 thoralf	wiking: I need some assistance.  I'm trying to debug run a python_modular example and get a (c++) stacktrace of what happens there.
 thoralf	wiking: Usually, I'd just run "gdb python script.py"
 thoralf	wiking: I see there's something in the ctest file in build/examples/undocumented/python_modular, but I can't get it running
 thoralf	HeikoS: I'm giving up, because I can't tell how to fix the python examples.  I'll send another patch without assertions soon.
@HeikoS	thoralf: ok
@HeikoS	thoralf: I know debugging python is a pain
@HeikoS	what you can do is to run it with valgrind then you at least get the shogun place where things fail
 thoralf	wiking: It's running, but I don't see a backtrace because python exists normally.
 thoralf	HeikoS: valgrind won't care about failing "REQUIRE"s ;)

@wiking	yes yes
@HeikoS	wiking: I want  to do the following
@HeikoS	cluster here has many computers with different architectures
@HeikoS	and I want to use shogun python from all of them
@HeikoS	so now I do this virtualenv stuff
 thoralf	Something is really wrong with python_modular.
@HeikoS	and compile shogun against it
 thoralf	It just started 20000 threads.
 thoralf	(And growing)
@HeikoS	wiking: how would you do that?
@HeikoS	wiking: I just wrote a script that installs python locally and then got clones shogun and compiles
@HeikoS	wiking: but there is a subtlety: all machines share the same FS, but machines might have different architectures
@HeikoS	so each job will have to do/update this local installation on start
@HeikoS	any idea how to best do this?
@wiking	HeikoS: ?
@HeikoS	even worse, there might be multiple jobs on the same machine
@wiking	HeikoS: so they share the repo?
-!- pickle27 [~kevin@d67-193-243-174.home3.cgocable.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@HeikoS	wiking: what?
@wiking	HeikoS: share fs -> share the cloned repo of shogun u use for building?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes but that is not good
@HeikoS	there should be one thing per job
 thoralf	HeikoS: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
@HeikoS	so every job starts with building shogun
 thoralf	HeikoS: Solved my problem. :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: Just install locally
@HeikoS	thoralf: so depending on the job id the prefix changes you mean?
@wiking	HeikoS: install it to a specific dir....
 thoralf	HeikoS: Yes,
 thoralf	HeikoS: Same problem here.
@HeikoS	thoralf: do you use this distributed stuff with shogun?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Got harded with cmake, but is possible. ;)
 thoralf	HeikoS: What do you mean?
@HeikoS	it would be cool to offer a script for this
@wiking	thoralf: harded?
@HeikoS	thoralf, wiking it would be good to have a script that locally installs shogun to a dir, including a local python install
@HeikoS	with virtualenv and pip
 thoralf	s/harded/harder/
@HeikoS	so that I just need to give a path and the rest is done automagically
@wiking	thoralf: how?
@wiking	thoralf: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
@wiking	i mean
 thoralf	PYTHON=/usr/bin/python PYTHONPATH=xxx/python2.7/dist-packages:. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=xxx/lib:. python script
@wiking	HeikoS: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, I will play a bit and share the script then
@wiking	HeikoS: that'll install u the shogun stuff whereever you want it to
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah but to use python there is more involved
@HeikoS	if I dont have root rights
@HeikoS	which is why I want to use virtualenv
@wiking	HeikoS: ?
@wiking	i dont get it
@wiking	the whole shogun thing will be installed under
@wiking	<prefix>
@HeikoS	wiking: yes, but now imagine python is not installed
@wiking	<prefix>/lib <prefix>/include <prefix>/lib/python...
@wiking	HeikoS: install it to <prefix>
@HeikoS	wiking: exact, and now there are multiple architectures for the same FS
@wiking	HeikoS: and? u create different <prefix> for different arch
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@HeikoS	thats what I want
@HeikoS	with 1 click ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: what do u mean 1 click?
@HeikoS	wiking: a one liner
@wiking	HeikoS: create a script for it and that's all
@HeikoS	wiking: yes thats what I want, but not that experienced with this stuff
@wiking	i mean seriously it's not shogun's job to do this
@HeikoS	wiking: you are right
@HeikoS	but still I want it, dont want to add it to shogun, just asking for advice
@wiking	ah i see
@wiking	sorry then i misunderstood
@HeikoS	wiking: could you help me a bit with that?
@HeikoS	Ill share a google doc for live editing
@HeikoS	sent
@wiking	HeikoS: better share a gist ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah once its more mature
@HeikoS	because now I want to edit it a lot
 thoralf	Anyone knows what this tester.py does?
@HeikoS	thoralf: yes
@HeikoS	it runs the integration tests
@HeikoS	which means that it runs all python examples, and compares their output to the stored file
 thoralf	HeikoS: It starts 1000 threads per second... ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: really? thats not nice :)
 thoralf	HeikoS: My system is unresponsible for about 5-10 seconds.
 thoralf	No mouse movement.
@HeikoS	thoralf: oh man, thats not good
@HeikoS	any idea why it does that?
 thoralf	No:(
@HeikoS	thoralf: it didnt before (on my machine=)
 thoralf	libshogun-evaluation_cross_validation_locked_comparison starts about 10000 threads at once (?)
 thoralf	libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel started 19000 threads
@HeikoS	thoralf: did someone parallelize the cross-validation maybe?
 thoralf	Something is wrong here.
@HeikoS	because these examples did not do that when I wrote them
@HeikoS	all 1 threaded
 thoralf	I only have 8 cores on my workstation... I would expect that nobody tries to start more than 16 at once. ;)
 thoralf	HeikoS: Btw. another PR which should be merged before 1443, because it fixes the tests: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1444
@HeikoS	thoralf: why is this needed?
@HeikoS	the maximum?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Because the overhead is bigger than running 1 thread per core :)
@HeikoS	ok, waiting fo travis
@HeikoS	oh it did not trigger yet
 shogun-buildbot	build #6 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/6
 thoralf	wiking: I happened again that cmake started building gtest/gmock while Linking CXX executable shogun-unit-test
@wiking	thoralf: /j #cmake
@wiking	thoralf: and start asking around
 thoralf	wiking: Sorry, I can't start debugging something else yet.  I just you might be interested in bug reports related to cmake.
@wiking	thoralf: this kind of stuff i cannot help with as they are really cmake related bugs
@wiking	so you are better of talking with cmake developers
 thoralf	wiking: I understand.  But in this case I won't do anything because this exceeds what I can do in my time.
 thoralf	wiking: I'd really like to.

@sonney2k	wiking, so what is missing wrt cmake now - static interfaces, detection of ruby narray and well all the failing tests of course then we are back
@sonney2k	wiking, which of these things can you still do?

@sonney2k	wiking, any ideas about http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1261/steps/test/logs/stdio ?
@wiking	sonney2k: narray i'll check becuase that's really weird... but i'll do it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, looks like you broke the tests? http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1830/steps/compile/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	HeikoS, MMDKernelSelectionMedian_unittest.cc
@wiking	sonney2k: for cygwin maybe a make install would help... but i'm not so sure, basically it just cannot find the shared lib, but i'll try setting an env variable or something
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I did not even commit anything
@sonney2k	wiking, Re cygwin didn't this work?
@wiking	sonney2k: i never seen cygwin running examples...
@HeikoS	wiking, sonney2k is there a way to statically link certain parts of shogun?
@wiking	sonney2k: http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/900
@sonney2k	CMakeFiles/shogun-unit-test.dir/statistics/MMDKernelSelectionMedian_unittest.cc.o: In function `CmpHelperEQ<double, double>':
@sonney2k	/usr/include/gtest/gtest.h:1328: undefined reference to `testing::internal::EqFailure(char const*, char const*, testing::internal::String const&, testing::internal::String const&, bool)'
@sonney2k	so it is w/ linking already
@wiking	sonney2k: this is like the old ./configure stuff... it never ran examples
@iglesiasg	time for the weekly report!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes I saw that, but no idea whats the problem there
@sonney2k	wiking, seems like LD_LIBRARY_PATH can be set withing cygwin
@sonney2k	wiking, so that would fix it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no
@wiking	sonney2k: i'll do that soonish
@sonney2k	wiking, and whats up with the workshop videos?
@wiking	sonney2k: b/w problem here
@sonney2k	wiking, so now what?
@wiking	sonney2k: i'll be on a good net this week
@wiking	i'll try to upload as mcuh as i can then
@sonney2k	wiking, ok
@wiking	btw: any ideas how i can find fast unique values in an SGVector?
@HeikoS	wiking: best you can do is linear I guess
@wiking	HeikoS: and creating a histogram of an SGVector elements? i mean w/o using some funky std::map shit?
@HeikoS	wiking: why not using map?
@wiking	HeikoS: well i didn't want it
@wiking	but seems i have to
@HeikoS	wiking: best way
@HeikoS	and almost no effort
@HeikoS	haha use boost ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: heheh it's going to be part of shogun
@wiking	;)
@HeikoS	or add a unique method to vector then its also easy
 foulwall	sonney2k , I've checked applications/arts,  and got error "[ERROR] ALPHABET too small to contain all symbols in histogram", don't know why
 thoralf	wiking: unique values?  What about hashing?
@wiking	thoralf: std::map will then do that for me ;P
 thoralf	wiking: Sorry, I was lagging.  Python tests are still sucking :(
 thoralf	sonney2k: Any idea?  I have 3 tests which are dying after generating tons of threads: integration-python_modular-tester, libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel, python_modular-modelselection_grid_search_libsvr_modular
@HeikoS	wiking: what do I do if my installed swig version is 1.3
@HeikoS	thoralf, sonney2k ^
@HeikoS	ah sorry
@HeikoS	install swig2.0 does it
@HeikoS	swig points to 1.3
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah libsvm's parallelization might be slow
 thoralf	sonney2k: But 20000 threads?
@HeikoS	wiking: Error at cmake/FindSuperLU.cmake:67 (include)
@HeikoS	include could not find load file
@wiking	HeikoS: it's there in the repo
@wiking	so i wonder how's that possible at all
@sonney2k	thoralf, sure kernel rows computed in parallel
@HeikoS	wiking: whats the name?
@wiking	cmake/FindSuperLU.cmake
@HeikoS	wiking: how to install it?
@sonney2k	wiking, do we have an option w/ cmake to specify a swig executable / python executable?
@wiking	HeikoS: ?
@HeikoS	cmake outputs an error and dies
@HeikoS	with this superlu message, what to do?
@wiking	HeikoS: dunno man... cmake/FindSuperLU.cmake is in the repository
@wiking	it's impossible it cannot find it
@wiking	sonney2k: yes
@wiking	sonney2k: one way is to set -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
@wiking	where the python/swig resides u want
@wiking	other way is to set the exact path
@wiking	but this are all standard cmake stuff
@wiking	i'm not the manual of cmake :(
@sonney2k	wiking, we really need a cmake documentation. you are repeating things too often :/
@sonney2k	wiking, no but this would only look for swig right? if my swig executable is named swig2.2 then what?
@wiking	check your FindSWIG.cmake
@wiking	sonney2k: the cmake documentation is pretty fucking great
@wiking	just need to google it
@wiking	sonney2k: and yes i agree that we need cmake related info about shogun
@wiking	but not about the things you are asking now
@wiking	because those are really cmake related FAQs
 thoralf	sonney2k: Mind if I add a limit to simultaneous sg_parallel->get_num_threads(); threads? ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, these are *not* parallel threads
@sonney2k	thoralf, just #cpu
 thoralf	sonney2k: It looks like it's creating all threads at a time.
@sonney2k	foulwall, I guess you used an example file that contains not just 'ACGT' characters
@sonney2k	thoralf, then it would be a bug - why do you think so?
@HeikoS	wiking: I found the problem: cmake_push_check_state() Unknown cmake command
@HeikoS	cmake 2.8.5
 thoralf	sonney2k: It calls pthread_create in a loop.
 thoralf	sonney2k: My fault.
 thoralf	Sorry.

 foulwall	sonney2k: I did  ` python arts.py data/ARTS.dat.bz2  ` in applications/arts , is it correct?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Okay, it's no problem in there.
 thoralf	sonney2k: But then it doesn't explain 20000 threads when running libshogun-modelselection_grid_search_kernel or python_modular-modelselection_grid_search_libsvr_modular
@sonney2k	foulwall, no
 foulwall	sonney2k: argh, do I need to extract ARTS.data.bz2?
@sonney2k	foulwall, let me find a file for you
@sonney2k	foulwall, no
@sonney2k	sec
 thoralf	sonney2k: gtg, can wait until tomorrow.
@sonney2k	foulwall, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31480471/dna.fa
@sonney2k	thoralf, well does threads=1 help?
 foulwall	ok sonney2k , let me have a try
@sonney2k	thoralf, IIRC modsel is not done in parallel
@sonney2k	foulwall, it will take ~600MB CPU
@sonney2k	foulwall, and at least 5mins
 thoralf	sonney2k: I'm just running "make tests", so it should work like everywhere else.
@sonney2k	foulwall, did it work?
 foulwall	sonney2k: finished , only got -1, -42 , how do I demostrate them on web?
 foulwall	finished in 134 secs:)
@HeikoS	wiking:  shogun needs cmake>2.8.5
@HeikoS	thats a bit annoying
@wiking	HeikoS: life's cruel
@sonney2k	foulwall, you have an old version of shogun installed then
@wiking	HeikoS: you can replace cmake_push_check_state
@wiking	in FindSuperLu
 foulwall	than I'll recompile the newest one
@wiking	and then it won't need that
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, will try some other things
 foulwall	sonney2k: and retry
@HeikoS	I need things to work automatically thats the problem
@sonney2k	foulwall, you should have gotton -42 and some real valued numbers. so just plot the numbers in a curve
@wiking	HeikoS: well it's only that Find* stuff... so i really think that there's a way around.. look in other Find.cmake script
 foulwall	ok sonney2k
@sonney2k	foulwall, the -42 is sth that you should maybe move to 0 in the curve
@HeikoS	ah we should have a binary shogun release with static stuff this eats my nerves ;)
 foulwall	sonney2k: ok
@HeikoS	btw how is the .deb coming along?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we don't even have cmake replacing all of configure so far so far far away
@HeikoS	wiking, sonney2k please see my latest push
@HeikoS	and let me know if oyu agree

@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes but not in the old version I have here on the institute cluster
@HeikoS	so adding it makes things work
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I would rather require a new version then
@HeikoS	sonney2k: this would deny cmake for me, but this mini fix makes it work so I thought it is easier this way
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no you could easily download http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.11.2-Linux-i386.tar.gz and be happy
@HeikoS	sonney2k: you mean install locally?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sure.
@sonney2k	I did this on many buildbots
@HeikoS	ok then, we can remove the thing again,
@HeikoS	I gotta go now though, will do it tomorrow
@HeikoS	see you!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, do you know which version
@sonney2k	HeikoS, has that file?

 lambday	sonney2k: oh
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 lambday	HeikoS: I will check out colpack (its the same one that Krylstat uses) for graph coloring thing
 lambday	and check out how our sparse matrix things fit into that
 lambday	HeikoS: but I am kinda worried about CG solvers....
-!- foulwall [~user@2001:da8:215:c252:b1e8:dc7c:8bc4:a5da] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 lambday	without preconditioners, for some data they don't seem to converge
 lambday	HeikoS: but I will check on real data (the ozone matrix) and then will see... the thing is, I don't have a reference value to check it with (our CStatistics::log_det fails for that huge matrix)
 lambday	HeikoS: I will try if I can use Krylstat to generate that
 lambday	sonney2k: do we have logistic regression?
@sonney2k	lambday, yes with liblinear
 lambday	sonney2k: alright.. great! one of my friends was asking about it, I said I'll check out... will tell him
 lambday	:D
@sonney2k	lambday, you have to use L2R_LR_DUAL or L1R_LR (or see LIBLINEAR_SOLVER_TYPE in Liblinear.h)
