 CaBa	wiking: ping
@wiking	pong
 CaBa	wiking: i already asked this a few days ago but i don't remember any conclusion - can i couple two parameters when building model selection parameters?
 CaBa	wiking: or can i build the tree manually in a way such that they are always the same?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	i told you that time
@wiking	i reckon it's not possible atm
 CaBa	wiking: can't i make a subtree for every paired parameter version?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	should be able to
@wiking	but then again
 CaBa	wiking: https://gitlab.unique-internet.de/snippets/7
@wiking	CaBa, i can get back to you about this
@wiking	in 48 hours
@wiking	hopefully
 CaBa	wiking: i tried this, but this segfaults upon model selection then
@wiking	:S
 CaBa	wiking: okay, thanks
@wiking	sorry for not being able to answer earlier
@wiking	:(
 CaBa	np
