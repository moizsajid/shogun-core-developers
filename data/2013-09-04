 van51	hello sonne|work
 sonne|work	hey van51!
 van51	sorry for the delay, but I was out of town for some family stuff and I only had a data plan on my mobile
 van51	sonne|work: in a couple of hours I promise it will be merge-able :)
 sonne|work	ok perfect :)
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 van51	sonne|work: btw I changed the code a bit to support all DotFeatures
 van51	sonne|work: and on the benchmarks from the methods benchmark_add_to_dense etc
 sonne|work	what is the speed penalty?
 sonne|work	I think we need sth like this but not sure how to do it elegently
 van51	sonne|work: it was like 3 times slower, but when using it in a task with SVMOcas it was pretty much the same
 sonne|work	elegantly
 sonne|work	yeah that is too much :/
 sonne|work	maybe we can come up with sth more clever
 sonne|work	so please do the PR for the fast variant that only supports a single feature type
 van51	sonne|work: ok then
 van51	sonne|work: when I push I will comment on the code where a change is needed and maybe we can come up with something better afterwards
 sonne|work	ok

 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: hi!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: how is it going?

@HeikoS	votjakovr: looks good to me, what is the particular question you have?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i'd like just show you :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: probably you have some other view
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok, I am fine with that, this particular setup is alsways the same for all GPs right?

@HeikoS	for some reason caused tester.py to crash
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I really want to get rid of those integration tests, I have never seen a case yet where they helped and saw many cases where they just cause trouble and work
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, yes, I think we should push that initiative definitely
@iglesiasg	the question to answer is, do we lose anything dropping integration tests? Is what they cover already done by unit tests?
@iglesiasg	or can be done with unit tests rather
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I checked them, almost all of them can be replaced by units
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, why almost? Which ones cannot?
@HeikoS	in fact thats better since we currently only know THAT something changes, whereas with unit we know whats wrong since one expects a certain result
@HeikoS	like internal states of the objects cannot really be covered
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: but all the numerical stuff can
@HeikoS	I dont think we loose anything if we dropped them after replacing by units

 votjakovr	HeikoS: May i rename get_log_ml_estimate to get_log_marginal_likelihood_estimate?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: rename it to get_marginal_likelihood_estimate
@HeikoS	votjakovr: since that is what it does, the log is wrong, could you also update the documentation?
@HeikoS	it returns an unbiased estimate to the marginal likelihood, and this number is returned in log-domain
@HeikoS	which is different to an unbiased estimate of the log-ml
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, no problem
@HeikoS	votjakovr: thanks!

 thoralf	Hey S?ren.
 sonne|osx	thoralf: oh hey
 sonne|osx	thoralf: whats up?
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Nothing - except one PR I just submitted few minutes ago.
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong, because I'm not used to template programming any more.
 sonne|osx	thoralf: you are touching a minefield
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Which one?
 sonne|osx	whenever we use templates we have to think how we represent this in the modular interfaces
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Hmm.  I think I didn't change the API.
 thoralf	sonne|osx: Would travis tell if I did?
 sonne|osx	thoralf: not sure about travis buildbot should though
 sonne|osx	thoralf: anyway it would be best to send the non-templates fixes separately

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: !
@HeikoS	I need your help
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: good
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: Eigenvalues
@HeikoS	extremal
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	lambdays Lanczos implementation does not converge
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I need some preconditioned method
 lisitsyn	ehm interesting
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: slep has one
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: https://code.google.com/p/blopex/
@HeikoS	this one
@HeikoS	have you heard of that?
@HeikoS	or do you have any other ideas?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm not really
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so the condition number is bad, right?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, but there is something else, since I increased the smallest eigenvalue quite a bit
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: with shift?
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: have you already tried that 'feast' solver?
@HeikoS	reference?
 lisitsyn	http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~polizzi/feast/
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: in my opinion the main reason to trust it - intel took it to MKL
 lisitsyn	but I can't say anything about stability
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah thats a good idea
@HeikoS	is this already in shogun or did someone use it?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no
@HeikoS	Fast convergence - FEAST converges in ~2-3 iterations with very high accuracy
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	if that was true
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that can be true
@HeikoS	lanczos did not converge after 30000
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: arpack converges in a few iterations too
 lisitsyn	but the iteration is not that simple step
@HeikoS	arpack, does it have a sparse eigensolver?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it doesn't depend on representation
@HeikoS	its definitely more modern than the old things I am currently using
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: with given vector x it needs Ax and sometimes A^{-1}x
@HeikoS	arpack just contains the std stuff
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: arpack is not numerically stable though
 lisitsyn	people complain about its stability
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	feast seems to compute all eigenpairs
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: in a given interval
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I just need the smallest
@HeikoS	and largest
@HeikoS	lower bound is obviously 0
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: should be possible, lemme check
@HeikoS	but upper I dont know
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm true
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well there is RRR method
 lisitsyn	lapack's dsyevr
 lisitsyn	once tridiagonalized it can obtain eigenvalues
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you use to tridiagonalize?
@HeikoS	no idea
@HeikoS	I dont even know if thats possible
