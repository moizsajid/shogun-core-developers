 wiking	blackburn: ping?
 blackburn	wiking: pong
 wiking	do we have a lasso solver?
 blackburn	wiking: yes
 blackburn	regression? binary? multiclass?
 wiking	multiclass
 blackburn	wiking: tree guided would work
 blackburn	MulticlassTreeGuidedLogisticRegression
 blackburn	wiking: it is not trivial to use though :D
 blackburn	kinda rocket science and requires a phd
 blackburn	I mean it is not documented IIRC :D
 wiking	yeah i can see that
 blackburn	wiking: it is actually for tree lasso but it works as basic lasso as well
 blackburn	wiking: hmm actually MulticlassLogisticRegression is L1 reg logistic regression
 blackburn	is that what you need?
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	i need to optimize
 wiking	\lambda \sum ||\beta_i||_2
 wiking	- f(\lambda)
 wiking	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	wiking: what is beta what is f?
 wiking	\beta is an M lenght vector
 wiking	while L is a loss function
 blackburn	well bfgs, etc :)
 wiking	lol
 wiking	ookeey face
 wiking	there's this paper
 wiking	Heterogeneous Feature Machines for Visual Recognition
 wiking	has a different approch for mkl
