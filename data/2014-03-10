@HeikoS	lambday: in the b-test paper code?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah... oh and they used 0 mean as well
@HeikoS	lambday: so thats exactly what we do for the linear time mmd
@HeikoS	lambday: just that this is not really a linear time estimate ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: they cheated there
@HeikoS	we would just use the diagonal of this matrix
@HeikoS	lambday: or in fact block averages
@HeikoS	lambday: can you send me the githuvb page?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. just a sec
 lambday	HeikoS: https://github.com/wojzaremba/btest
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, so they cheat for the variance
 lambday	HeikoS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance Parallel algorithm -
 lambday	talks about blocks
@HeikoS	lambday: oh yeah, its totally possible to compute the blocks using multicore, everything is independent
@HeikoS	lambday: good idea and extension :)
@HeikoS	but check the btest.m file first
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah
 lambday	so that implementation is incorrent?
@HeikoS	there they iterate over the blocks
@HeikoS	lambday: nono its fine
@HeikoS	but they compute a h-term for every block
 lambday	yeah
@HeikoS	so that mean(hh) is the simple average of the blocks
@HeikoS	and var is the covariance (computed in quadratic time)
@HeikoS	we compute the variance in linear time via doing running averages, thats very similar to what I did in the linear time MMD code
@HeikoS	for computing the covariance matrix between the kernels
 lambday	HeikoS: umm I am confused - do you mean https://github.com/lambday/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/statistics/LinearTimeMMD.cpp#L226 this is how it should be done?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, this is just a running average of the individual statistic values
 lambday	HeikoS: this one for computing covariance matrix - https://github.com/lambday/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/statistics/LinearTimeMMD.cpp#L505
@HeikoS	lambday: for covariance matrix its also similar, since this covariance is between kernels
 lambday	yeah!
@HeikoS	I think the code should be re-usable, just compouting the statistic should be different
@HeikoS	first it was running average/variance of these linear time estimates
@HeikoS	now it is a running average/variance of those quadratic time block estimates
@HeikoS	lambday: but it will be very easy to verify - using the permutation
 lambday	HeikoS: ah this part has to be copied - I can't think of any clever way to separate this nicely :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: and I didn't get the verify point :(
@HeikoS	lambday: why copy?
@HeikoS	lambday: should be done in streaming mmd I guess
@HeikoS	that was the whole point of having a shared base class wasnt it?
 lambday	HeikoS: put that part into another function?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	both linear time mmd and btest just do this online mean/variance of something
 lambday	HeikoS: alright - shall we do the same for covariance as well? cause we'd be computing that between kernels for btest too, right?
 lambday	HeikoS: I mean, move that online algorithm into another function
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah!
@HeikoS	lambday: and for the verification:
@HeikoS	lambday: we can just compute the null distribution via the permutation test
@HeikoS	lambday: which gives the ground truth
@HeikoS	lambday: and then we can compare this to the Gaussian from variance approximation
 lambday	HeikoS: oh got it
-!- gif [~gif@130.195.253.57] has joined #shogun
 lambday	HeikoS: well I think both these methods can be moved to parent - things would be exactly same (except for the value of m2 which would be m/2 for linear and m for btest, which we can just pass via an additional arg)... things are exactly same!
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, indeed
@HeikoS	lambday: I have to go to bed, see you tomorrow!
 lambday	HeikoS: okay :) good night man!

 PirosB3	Hey guys, I just posted on the ML a new restructured version of the Shogun SaaS spec. If anyone wants to have a look and has some comments, be my guest :) The doc is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KISZL6lyeR-RvWEycTKqOunr3gwrA3PUnxZ8hiJYfgw/edit#heading=h.k3bcyd74up5z
 pickle27	Im pretty indifferent, you were able to do them pretty quick before
 pickle27	its just 2 simple evolutions and then we're done
 sonne|osx	pickle27: well it makes sense if you do the releases of the webstuff in the future yourself anyways - right?
 pickle27	yeah sure
 pickle27	what do I need?
 pickle27	also I lost that ssh key when I re did my home computer
@HeikoS	sonne|osx: getting food now, back in 40 mins

 pickle27	can you try and run them again?
 kprah	wiking: hey!
@sonney2k	pickle27, then it says No evolution required.
 pickle27	damn
 pickle27	I mean I can add the line back to the model and it will stop crashing
 pickle27	but deleting that old foreign key was the whole point
 kprah	\msg wiking Should I unify all the bundle solvers : primal and bmrm to a single cutting plane solver?
 pickle27	sonney2k: we have 2 options
 pickle27	we can put the line in the modelback so it knows what to do with that field
 pickle27	or we drop the column manually
 pickle27	I don't know if django will like that
 sonne|osx	pickle27: what would I need to run?
 pickle27	you'd have to open mysql and run
 pickle27	ALTER TABLE pages_articles DROP COLUMN rootsubpage
 pickle27	if that fails we'll probably have to restore the db

 pickle27	can you print a schema of the db?
 PirosB3	need some Django help guys?

 pickle27	the issue is django is still finding the field somehow
 pickle27	\and then its not on the model so its throwing an error
 PirosB3	mm interesting..
 PirosB3	did you grep for the field name?

 PirosB3	interesting, so where is it failing
 PirosB3	can you paste the trace?
 pickle27	wait
 pickle27	I might have found it
 pickle27	sonney2k:
 pickle27	found it
 pickle27	its a stray field

-!- kprah [67157d4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.76] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	okay I actually started something as I have absolutely no clue
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/lisitsyn/plugins-playground
 lisitsyn	it is quite easy to load library and stuff
 lisitsyn	current version just loads some .so dynamically and calls method
 lisitsyn	so the thing is that how do we go next
 lisitsyn	basically what I see is
 lisitsyn	we have to have some base classes
 lisitsyn	as classifier multiclass classifier etc
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: oh wow
@HeikoS	cool that already works
 lisitsyn	but we'd have to stick to some get("parametername",value);
 lisitsyn	otherwise we can't get getter
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	let me explain
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: is that now parameter framework or plugins?
@HeikoS	or both at once?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: they are pretty much linked together it seems
 lisitsyn	so what I mean is
 lisitsyn	imagine we have super svm
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: mmh so those getters are like ultra slow right?
 lisitsyn	and it has parameter heiko
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what to do with iterating over matrices?
@HeikoS	and stuff like that?
@HeikoS	or do we only do that for CSGObject like getters?
@HeikoS	or how?
 lisitsyn	that's the question
 lisitsyn	so our super svm has parameter heiko = 3
@HeikoS	access should be O(1) not O(1000)

@HeikoS	iglesiasg: greetings!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, hello hello
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that's the thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: mmh but do we actually call getters in loops?
 lisitsyn	so well it is the question whether we call get/set pretty often
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: one can always call it before right?
 lisitsyn	well yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and iterating over matrices etc still works directly right?
 lisitsyn	yeah this is not about matrices
 lisitsyn	matrices are not modular at all they are still in core
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: actually
 lisitsyn	what we'd need is
 lisitsyn	to replace all getters in classes
 lisitsyn	which are plugins
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah I see
 lisitsyn	see what I mean?
 lisitsyn	anything else is ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so anyone who attempts this will commit suicide right?
 lisitsyn	why?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: remove rootsubpage
 lisitsyn	the problem is that once we loaded a plugin
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: actually, I think computationally it should be fine, why would one call getters in a loop?
 lisitsyn	and spawned its say classifier
 pickle27	sonney2k: would help if I actually fixed it lol

 lisitsyn	one downside that I see
 lisitsyn	we'd get some string things
 lisitsyn	libsvm = shogun.require('LibSVM')
 lisitsyn	that's like handle for library
 lisitsyn	or plugin
 lisitsyn	next what we do is
 lisitsyn	svm = libsvm.spawnClassifier()
 lisitsyn	or sth like that
-!- kprah_ [67157f4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.127.76] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	to do something with hashing
 lisitsyn	we can do this thing:
 lisitsyn	svm_C_parameter = shogun.parameter('C')
-!- kprah [67157d4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.76] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 lisitsyn	svm.get(svm_C_parameter);
 lisitsyn	oh sorry
 lisitsyn	it should be shogun.floatParameter('C')
 lisitsyn	like that
 lisitsyn	this object would have some hash or index
 lisitsyn	so get is still fast
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: are you following this sht? :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah I am sorry
 lisitsyn	no I just mean should I stop at this point
 lisitsyn	or continue some explanations hehe
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: could you set up a document where you write example (pseudo) code how things are used?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its hard to loose overview
 lisitsyn	yeah
@HeikoS	this spawn thing, I did not really get it
 lisitsyn	it comes directly from my mind yet
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well ok that needs explanation here I guess
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: once we loaded a library
 lisitsyn	we'd have to keep it as an object in our scope
 lisitsyn	however that's okay if you just recall it next with
 lisitsyn	shogun.module('LibSVM')
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: the point is that if we have plugins we don't have qualified names in the scope
 lisitsyn	we don't have shogun.classifier.LibSVM anymore
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cant we enforce those?

@HeikoS	in a tree like manner?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you mean?
 lisitsyn	it would be possible for python
 lisitsyn	but java etc
 lisitsyn	I don't like altering behaviour in various languages
@HeikoS	yeah I agree
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: actually I think you just should do this,  discuss with somebody who wants to spend lots of brainpower on it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: unlikely to get much feedback from the other core people ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll dump my mind laterz
 lisitsyn	to some issue
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe a list of pros/cons would be nice too
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I currently dont really have an idea how this works in principle
 lisitsyn	yeah but this looks like a complete solution in my mind
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well I pretty much trust you :D

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: anybody yet interested in that?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: gsoc?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe you should make it a bit more attractive in the description.
 lisitsyn	no that's too hardcore
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	yeah my bad may be
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: Its one of the most interesting projects
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and its not really ML, so that is interesting
@HeikoS	but also to get to know shogun
@HeikoS	unusual coding tasks
@HeikoS	etc
 lisitsyn	well I know a student that I can guide directly :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok?
@HeikoS	tell me more
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just kidding
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	we should soon get applications btw :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yourself?
@HeikoS	haha
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: quite near
@HeikoS	noooo way man, too precious
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah your girl? ;)
 pickle27	sonne|osx: have you deployed again yet?
 lisitsyn	haha yeah but this could be considered unfair

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw will you come to the summer workshop this year?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah if I can afford it
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how do you feel about our gsoc status currently?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that's okay
 lisitsyn	we have some strong students
