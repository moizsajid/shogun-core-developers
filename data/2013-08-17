@sonney2k	van51, hey how is your example going?
@sonney2k	gsomix, and any progress wrt the libsvm reader?
 van51	sonney2k: hey, I have some results and the quadratic features in that case don't seem to be doing too well
 van51	sonney2k: https://gist.github.com/van51/6213951
@sonney2k	van51, cool.
@sonney2k	van51, what does 1 n-gram mean?
 van51	sonney2k: just the plain tokens
 van51	sonney2k: no combinations
@sonney2k	so n=1 ?
 van51	sonney2k: the ngram size for the tokens was 5
 van51	sonney2k: that ngram means how many tokens to combine
 van51	needs a rename probably
@sonney2k	van51, hmmhh hard to understand why the quadratic stuff doesn't help
@sonney2k	van51, maybe 5-grams is too much...
 van51	sonney2k: maybe I should try increasing the hash size?
@sonney2k	van51, how big is it?
 van51	sonney2k: these results were with 15 bits
@sonney2k	van51, ahh ok that would probably help
@sonney2k	van51, I would also be interested in the pure baseline I mean n=1
@sonney2k	van51, and maybe you could also try different n I mean n=1, n=2, .. n=8 with combineddotfeatures
 van51	sonney2k: ok, I'll have some results by tomorrow :)
 van51	sonney2k: right now I've started working on lbppyrfeatures a bit
@wiking	sonney2k: have u changed: .doxy2swig.py script?
@sonney2k	wiking, no
@wiking	sonney2k: doh for some reason it started to fail now File "/Users/wiking/shogun/src/.doxy2swig.py", line 212
@wiking	    if prot <> 'public':

@wiking	yeah that's the interestng part :(
@wiking	that why it suddenly started to fail again
@sonney2k	wiking, maybe some more strict check for clbas?
