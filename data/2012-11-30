 wiking	sonney2k: ok
 wiking	sonney2k: how do i dot product two SGVector in python/
 wiking	?
 wiking	as numpy.dot cannot work over RealVectors
 sonne|work	wiking: errm how did you end up with RealVectors?
 wiking	hehhe that's a good question
 wiking	so i'm trying to put together this toy example in python for latent svm
 wiking	i have a LatentFeatures that stores a vector of structures where each structure has an SGVector in it
 wiking	and when i try to access the SGVector<float64_t> in that structure
 wiking	i end up getting RealVectors
 wiking	sonne|work: i've thought there's a mapping between np.array <-> and SGVector
 wiking	but for some reason it doesn't kick in
 sonne|work	wiking: no there is none
 sonne|work	an SGVector will be translated to a numpy array
 sonne|work	so that is why I wonder how you manage to create and SGVector (if not manuallly)
 wiking	yeah that's what i wonder
 wiking	why the translation does not kick in
 sonne|work	wiking: how do you create it?
 wiking	so i have a simple struct
 wiking	struct CWhatever { CWhatever(SGVector<float64_t> x) : feature(x) {}  SGVector<float64_t> feature; };
 sonne|work	yeah if you access feature you will get it
 wiking	and in numpy i do this: Whatever(np.array([1.0,1.0])
 sonne|work	if you do CWhatever(numpy.array(..)) you get the vector
 sonne|work	inited
 wiking	x = Whatever(np.array([1.0,1.0])
 wiking	x.feature
 sonne|work	lost
 wiking	is not np.array
 sonne|work	wiking: add a method get_vector()
 sonne|work	then you will get the translated numpy.array
 wiking	let's see
 wiking	recompiling...
 wiking	ok cool now it works
 wiking	sonne|work: do u know why doesn't it kick in before?
 wiking	sonne|work: ok another problem
 blackburn	because typemaps work for return and input types
 wiking	blackburn: mmm seems it doesn't work in case of this type of func arg
 wiking	Whatever(np.array([1.0,1.0])
 wiking	blackburn: virtual CData* infer_latent_variable(const SGVector<float64_t>& w, index_t idx)=0;
 wiking	so when a reference to the sgvector is passed
 wiking	then the translation doesn't kick in i guess
 wiking	right
 wiking	?
 wiking	    dot = np.dot(x, w)
 wiking	TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'RealVector'
 blackburn	wiking: you mean if you overload it in python? yes
 wiking	w is const SGVector<float64_t>& w
 wiking	and i overload this func in python with the director
 wiking	and w is RealVector
 wiking	and not an np.array
 wiking	so the definition of that function should be virtual CData* infer_latent_variable(const SGVector<float64_t> w, index_t idx);
 wiking	i guess
 wiking	but then it's really stupid
 wiking	i mean passing the whole vector instead of a reference :S
 wiking	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	wiking: why not to pass whole vector?
 wiking	that's a rather awkward question
 wiking	why would i pass the whole thing on the stack
 wiking	instead of it's reference?
 blackburn	which whole thing? two pointers and length?
 sonne|work	wiking: why do you use &w ?
 wiking	sonne|work: as sizeof(int32_t) < sizeof(SGVector)
 wiking	and that the copy ctor doesn't kick in
 wiking	on the stack
 blackburn	so you want microoptimization which makes things impossible? ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: it is all lightweight - it increases refcount & copies ptr to data / size
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@dslb-088-075-034-093.pools.arcor-ip.net] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: still i believe that especially when one just reads the object, there's really no need for passing the whole object
 sonne|work	wiking: &w might be dangerous - no refcount increase - vector might be gone ...
 wiking	i mean this is my common c++ coding style
 blackburn	but you write python + C++ interaction now right?
 wiking	blackburn: well i thought it'd be niceer to make
 wiking	the example in python
 blackburn	will that work with python?
 wiking	seems i'm wrong :D
 blackburn	I don't know anything about references in python
 wiking	blackburn: well i guess it could if one does the typemapping
 blackburn	hard references I mean, like in C++
 wiking	blackburn: i've just read vaguely the reference manual for swig
 blackburn	no as it wraps another object on top of it
 blackburn	I think so
 wiking	seems to be possible somehow
 blackburn	it is not the issue to be solved I think - sizeof(SGVector) is just 3 ints
 blackburn	I don't know internals of python but I am sure the overhead is much better and you will not gain anything here
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	much worse :D
 blackburn	python should wrap more things and if you gain 8 bytes
 wiking	no i meant that why to waste resources when u dont really have to
 wiking	not only 8 bytes
 wiking	but ctor + dtor invocation
 blackburn	again - if you have a way to use C++ references in swig feel free
 wiking	blackburn: yeah trying to figure out :D
 blackburn	but it is not worth to change anything if you have no way around it
 wiking	blackburn: u should have been here the other day with k0stia
 wiking	telling him this line: "blackburn> again - if you have a way to use C++ references in swig feel free"
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	yeah he thinks C++ and python interaction is just
 blackburn	oneliner
 wiking	i think the attitude got a bit weird there
 wiking	when he was demanding a fix for his problem
 wiking	and that starting to say that it's not proper how it is done now
 sonne|work	wiking: don't use SGVector & if you don't have a compelling reason to do so
 wiking	blackburn: ok i'm stripping off &
 wiking	const would not be a problem, right? sonne|work ?
 wiking	const SGVector<float64_t> would be still a numpy.array?
 sonne|work	wiking: you could still modify vector.vec
 blackburn	should be but what you are going to const here?
 wiking	blackburn: sgvector itself
 wiking	sonne|work: u mean SGVector.vector?
 wiking	sonne|work: it's still a weird SWIG type thingy
 blackburn	I see nothing more safe in case of SWIG
 wiking	compiling .... let's see
 sonne|work	wiking: look - if you use multiple threads
 sonne|work	your reference might have become invalid
 sonne|work	so don't use it if you can avoid it
 wiking	look at us, discussing true geeky stuff :D
 wiking	how adoreable we are ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: alright
 wiking	sonne|work: anyways this example took more time than i thought in the first place and i want it to see it working
 wiking	blackburn: so i have this struct name now: MILFeature
 blackburn	hahaha OKAY
 wiking	i'm tempted to keep it like this :)
 sonne|work	MissinInLaFace?
 wiking	sonne|work: fyi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILF
 wiking	ah ok sorry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MILF_%28slang%29
 wiking	but yeah it's MIL = multiple instance learning
 sonne|work	Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
 wiking	sonne|work: hahahah pure guys really took a bad name
 blackburn	oh good boy sonne|work doesn't know such bad words
 wiking	blackburn: :D
 sonne|work	ahh stiflers mom
 wiking	lol face!!!
 wiking	i still get RealVector
 wiking	y u NO WORK!
 blackburn	u can haz realvector
 wiking	r no want realvector
 wiking	ok i stripped of const-nes as well
 wiking	better be working now!
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	why is there this shogun/features/DenseSubsetFeatures.cpp when it is completely empty!?
 wiking	pluskid made there some funky stuff
 wiking	ok
 wiking	there's seomthing wrong :(
 wiking	CData* CDirectorLatentModel::infer_latent_variable(SGVector<float64_t> w, index_t idx)
 wiking	and when i override this in python
 wiking	w is <Swig Object of type 'shogun::SGVector< double > *' at 0x10a514030>
 wiking	:S
 wiking	ideas?

 blackburn	wiking: what do you want to get?
 sonne|work	ahh ok with directors yes
 wiking	i want numpy.array
 wiking	:D
 wiking	i cannot?
 blackburn	no, I don't think so
 sonne|work	wiking: ohh that can become difficult... there are director in/out typemaps
 sonne|work	but I would rather deal with SGVector directly here
 wiking	ookey
 sonne|work	for performance sanity
 blackburn	there is no such thing like magic
 sonne|work	otherwise your SGVector -> numpy -> SGVector

 wiking	sonne|work: here?
 sonne|work	?
 wiking	sonne|work: am i wrong when i think that svmocas should be able to find a w that can classify a toy dataset where -1.0 labelled ones are points from a gaussian with mean 5.0 and variance 1.0 while +1.0 labelled ones are from a mean of 100.0 and variance 1.0
 wiking	and yeah it's only 1 dim
 sonne|work	sure yes
 wiking	you mean it should be able?
 wiking	because i've just tried with svmocas
 wiking	and no good :(
 wiking	same with liblinear
 wiking	i mean esseintially in this very stupid toy example
 wiking	w*100 should be positive
 wiking	and w*5.0 'should' be negative
 wiking	but that's not possible of course :P
 sonne|work	wiking: did you disable the bias term?
 sonne|work	bias is regularized but still
 sonne|work	w=0 and b sth like -30 :)
 wiking	sonne|work: but how would it be possible to find a number (w) that gives negative values for numbers around 5.0
 wiking	but positive ones for ~100.0
 sonne|work	not possible - you need a bias term
 sonne|work	center the data (zero mean) and try again otherwise
 wiking	i've enabled now bias
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@194.78.35.195] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@sonney2k	wiking, and?
@sonney2k	w/ bias all good?
@sonney2k	wiking, btw how about introducing SGVector<T> SGVector<T>::get()
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah that'd be a nice helper for pythno
