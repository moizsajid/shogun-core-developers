 K0stIa1	HI, all! I'm using shogun in python. My shogun.Distribution doesn't have Gaussian, GMM... can anyone give my advice why is it so ?

 n4nd0	blackburn: hey! how are you doing?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey pretty fine
 blackburn	what about you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am fine too
 n4nd0	blackburn: I start to feel happy with the hmsvm :)
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	did you test it already?
 n4nd0	I am getting the same results for small examples
 n4nd0	up to 10 training examples right now
 n4nd0	and after lot of errors fixed, the results are the same
 n4nd0	blackburn: I want to try now with larger datasets
 n4nd0	it could be really good if I could use the .mat files that can be generated with the hmsvm toolbox
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw I have bad understanding what can be HM outputted?
 blackburn	n4nd0: what are you using for tests?
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you mean with HM outputted?
 n4nd0	blackburn: just manually generated toy data
 blackburn	for example if I have images
 blackburn	what can be HMs?
 n4nd0	mmm do you mean what problem can be modelled with an hmm?
 blackburn	in case of bioinf stuff it goes to 4 state model like ACTG
 n4nd0	problems*
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	but what are other examples?
 n4nd0	I haven't used HMMs in computer vision
 n4nd0	so I cannot tell you about what it could be in an image
 n4nd0	I have googled it right now
 n4nd0	it seems that it is used in gesture recognition
 n4nd0	my guess:
 n4nd0	the hidden states are the gestures themselves
 n4nd0	the observation may be features extracted from images
 blackburn	hmm that sounds interesting :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: anyway, do you know if I can load from python *any* .mat file?
 blackburn	n4nd0: sure you can
 blackburn	scipy.io.loadmat
 n4nd0	when I tried to load the ones generated by the hmsvm toolbox
 n4nd0	I got some errors, but I was probably doing somethiing wrong
 blackburn	errors like?
 n4nd0	mmm let me check
 n4nd0	it was a couple of weeks ago when I tried this
 n4nd0	I don't even have that code more
 n4nd0	it was something very simple, 5-10 lines loading a module and trying to load the .mat file
 n4nd0	importing a module, better
 blackburn	I use .mat loading in my tester scripts and it works nice
 n4nd0	is any of those in the repo?
 n4nd0	using this from tools.load import LoadMatrix it didn't work out well
 blackburn	n4nd0: use scipy.io.loadmat
 blackburn	n4nd0: it returns dictionary matlab_name -> value
 n4nd0	blackburn: nice!
 n4nd0	I could get it to work
 n4nd0	thank you very much :)
 n4nd0	ok, I am going to take a break now to have dinner and see the games
 n4nd0	see you later!
 blackburn	n4nd0: :) see you
