@wiking	lambday: yo
@lambday	wiking: yooo
@lambday	sonney2k: yeah.. wasted a full year on earthly things :(
@wiking	wazza
@lambday	wiking: going to join HeikoS this summer
@wiking	yeah heard it
@lambday	wiking: for an internship in UCL
@lambday	wiking: what's up with you? which part of the globe you're in presently?
@wiking	now in europe again
@wiking	for 3 months
@lambday	man do you travel a lot :D
@wiking	mmm yeah
@wiking	btw anybody knows how to get openining mode of a FILE*
@wiking	?
@lambday	don't know if that's possible

 sonne|work1	wiking: fcntl with F_GETFL ?
 sonne|work1	wiking: http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getting-File-Status-Flags.html - so just the F_GETFL macro
@wiking	sonne|work1: this is for fd i presume
@lambday	Saurabh7: hey
 sonne|work1	wiking - sure
 sonne|work1	wiking: but you can easily get the fd from FILE right?
@wiking	yep yep
@wiking	the only problem is
@wiking	that in shoung we are FILE* oriented
@wiking	instead of fd
@wiking	ie if we get a FILE* we dont automatically open fd
@wiking	but if we get an fd we 'convert it' to FILE* :)
 sonne|work1	wiking: it would make sense to change the code to just use one of either FILE or fd ...
@wiking	i mean we are using FILE* everywhere
@wiking	only that we support to work on file that is given by fd
 Saurabh7	lambday, quick question wrt linalg::dot
 Saurabh7	lambday, i was trying to get dot product of vectors passed as ptr
 Saurabh7	but there seems to be no matching function call although its implemented https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/linalg/internal/implementation/Dot.h#L106
 Saurabh7	do you need to expose it in redux module?

@lambday	Saurabh7: hey there
@lambday	sorry I was in a meeting.. let me check your question
@lambday	Saurabh7: yes you're right.. we don't have a wrapper for naked ptrs yet
 Saurabh7	lambday, ok thats what i thought
 Saurabh7	how much faster will it be than CMath :: dot ?
@lambday	Saurabh7: I'll revisit these things in a few days.. maybe we can do some tricky stuffs so that one doesn't need to pass the length
@lambday	using std::begin() and std::end()
@lambday	but I guess this is c++14 stuffs
@lambday	Saurabh7: speed won't be too much of an issue..
@lambday	since the backend is eigen, it will be just as fast if you create an eigen map and do eigen dot
 Saurabh7	ok so the loops i see are jsut for the native
 Saurabh7	oh alright
@lambday	Saurabh7: we're thinking of getting rid of native btw..
@wiking	btw where's the actual implementation of eigen dot
@wiking	?
@lambday	wiking: you mean the place where we create the maps?
@lambday	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/linalg/internal/implementation/Dot.h#L141
@wiking	no i mean in eigen itself
@lambday	ah that I'll have to check
@lambday	maybe in MatrixBase, not sure
@lambday	wiking: https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/src/30954d1a91e3d9af86eba2096396fdc50c6f8536/Eigen/src/Core/MatrixBase.h?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#MatrixBase.h-198
 Saurabh7	lambday, also any reason why passing ptr should be better than SGVector itself ?
@wiking	lambday: implementation?
@lambday	wiking: checking
@lambday	Saurabh7: no reason.. but if in your impl you use, say, std::vector or std::unique_ptr<T[]> or naked ptr itself, you'd still be able to use linalg::dot with the same interface.. that was the goal
@lambday	Saurabh7: it's far from the goal as I can see :|
 Saurabh7	lambday, ok :)
 Saurabh7	lambday, the reason i ask is when i replace smth like float64_t* avec=((CDenseFeatures<float64_t>*) lhs)->get_feature_vector(idx_a, alen, afree);
 Saurabh7	with
 Saurabh7	SGVector<float64_t> avec=((CDenseFeatures<float64_t>*) lhs)->get_feature_vector(idx_a);
 Saurabh7	and use dot
 Saurabh7	SGVector one is slower for some reason
@lambday	wiking: https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/src/30954d1a91e3d9af86eba2096396fdc50c6f8536/Eigen/src/Core/Dot.h?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default
@lambday	Saurabh7: it creates an eigen map and destroys it that causes some overhead maybe..
@lambday	so you've noticed that native performs better?
@lambday	that's interesting!
@lambday	is the difference significant?
 Saurabh7	lambday, right now i am using ptrs and CMath::dot
 Saurabh7	and its a bit faster
 Saurabh7	ia m playing with kmeans and distance computations
@lambday	yeah that just runs a loop..
@lambday	okay
@wiking	lambday: i have couple of wondering thoughts in my head: a) would eigen be able to use sse4.2 dot product ? :)
@wiking	b) whether eigen expects the underlying memory aligned?
@lambday	wiking: I had a hunch that you'd be asking about simd thing :D
@lambday	not sure.. I'll have to check.. maybe lisitsyn knows..
@lambday	Saurabh7: I'd bet that the overhead is due to temporary object creation.. gcc vectorizes the loop in a similar way for native also I guess.. so if eigen guys are not doing anything explicit, the product code would be same
 Saurabh7	lambday, i will comment in a issue with the differences because it can be  a bit significant
 Saurabh7	lambday, oh alright
@lambday	Saurabh7: that would be great! It might give some motivation to keep the poor NATIVE backend still alive..
@lambday	Saurabh7: btw have you tried viennacl dot? you may be surprised
@lambday	dot<Backend::VIENNACL>(a,b)
 Saurabh7	lambday, so you wouldn't expect better with eigen and naked ptr ?
 Saurabh7	no i havent , ned to try
@lambday	Saurabh7: I never thought that the map creation part can pose any significant overhead.. so I expected eigen dot to rather be a bit better than native, for large enough vectors..
@lambday	but small ones, it may be a bit slow
@lambday	Saurabh7: check with vectors of size 1bil
 Saurabh7	lambday, ok
 Saurabh7	but i wasnt testing the dot in isolation
 Saurabh7	regarding the issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2987
 Saurabh7	so there might be other things going on
@lambday	Saurabh7: great discussion man!
@lambday	for these things, we need profiler
 Saurabh7	lambday, :) i was using the dot in distance computations for dataset arnd 2000 isntances
 Saurabh7	20k
 Saurabh7	lambday, ye i saw your benchamrks
 Saurabh7	i  need to try that out
@lambday	if we can figure out the part of the algorithm that stalls us for the longest, we'll focus on that.. eigen dot/native dot may not be the bottleneck
 Saurabh7	yup we figured most of the parts and after changing the distance things too its much better
 Saurabh7	lambday, but the dot thing came up because i used linalg::dot with sgvectors and the performace decreased
 Saurabh7	but  its  not a big issue
 Saurabh7	thanks though :)

 sonne|work1	performance of dot largely depends on #dims of the data...
 sonne|work1	I mean with 2d data the overhead of even using eigen is probably making dot look lousy
