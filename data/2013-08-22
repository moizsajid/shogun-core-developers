@wiking	why do we assume in case of serialisation that a template class will always get a builtintype as template arg?
 lisitsyn	wiking: all template classes are specialized in C++ IIRC
 lisitsyn	err
 lisitsyn	.cpp
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	not C++
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'm talking about class_list.cpp
@wiking	lisitsyn: so it's generated in a way that if there's a TEMPLATE
@wiking	then it'll generate like TemplateClass<PT_*>
@wiking	e.g. TemplateClass<bool> etc.
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	what's wrong?
@wiking	but what if a template is not like that?:)
 lisitsyn	MyClass<OtherClass>?
@wiking	so that it's template argument is actually not a PT_*
@wiking	yeah something like that
 lisitsyn	throw new FuckYouException();
 lisitsyn	jk :D
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: well it is not supported as Soeren used templates only to provide various feature types

 lisitsyn	pickle27: yo howdy
 pickle27	lisitsyn: hey!
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I actually have a question for you
 pickle27	I was looking into making a getter for the time separated covariance matrices as per the emails with Andreas
 pickle27	but they are SGNDArrays
 pickle27	so I made the getter but it is of no use from python_modular
 pickle27	so wondering what the options are
 lisitsyn	pickle27: what do you mean by is of no use?
 pickle27	well it returns an SGNDArray swig obj
 pickle27	but there is no way to get the data from it
 lisitsyn	ahh
 pickle27	the get_matrix returns a pointer
 pickle27	so one option is to make a new method for NDArray that returns SGMatrix
 pickle27	or make the getter take a number and return that MAtrix from the Array and not change the Array class
 lisitsyn	pickle27: something must be wrong with typemaps
 lisitsyn	that's essentially it
 lisitsyn	pickle27: could you show me the method?
 pickle27	I don't think anything is wrong with the typemaps this situation just isn't accounted for
 pickle27	here
 pickle27	SGNDArray<float64_t> CFFSep::get_covs() const
 pickle27	{
 pickle27	return m_covs;
 pickle27	}
 pickle27	if I used it in python and print the return val I get:
 pickle27	<Swig Object of type 'shogun::SGNDArray< double > *' at 0x245cdc0>
 pickle27	and if I try to access the data using .array or using get_matrix(0) I get something like this:
 pickle27	<Swig Object of type 'shogun::T_ALPHA_BETA_TABLE *' at 0x251adf8>
 lisitsyn	pickle27: looks quite strange indeed
 lisitsyn	alpha beta table is something from the outer space
 pickle27	haha
 lisitsyn	how can that be here :)
 lisitsyn	I didn't even know we have such a class
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I think its because its a pointer
-!- foulwall [~user@2001:da8:215:c252:f035:404c:df34:eab8] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	pickle27: as a workaround I can suggest to add get_cov(int)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: thats what I was thinking
 lisitsyn	that returns slices of the n-d array
 pickle27	lisitsyn: the other option would be to create a new method for SGNDArray that does the same
 pickle27	but how to name it to avoid confusion with the C++ method that returns a pointer
 lisitsyn	pickle27: actually as we have typemaps we just have to fix it
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: have you used nd array typemaps?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: oh we actually do have a typemap for NDArray
 pickle27	I didn't think we did
 pickle27	lisitsyn: looks like we might only have a "from" and we need a "to"
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah I thought about it
 lisitsyn	pickle27: could you please check if it is really true
 lisitsyn	just check what is missed for sgndarray compared to sgmatrix
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I think I see it
 pickle27	lisitsyn: this will have to be done for each modular interface yes?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah unfortunately
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay I'll try and do for python today and maybe octave
 pickle27	I may just submit an issue on github for the remaining for now
 lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah please submit it

 iglesiasg	pickle27, I just read the logs and got a bit updated
 iglesiasg	pickle27, how is it going with it?
 pickle27	iglesiasg: actually just ran it for python and it looks good
 pickle27	wiking: is there a way to force the interfaces to rebuild? I seem to have to keep rebuilding from scratch in order for them to update

@HeikoS	hi
@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking do you know whether and how to do modular access to sparse matrices?
@HeikoS	is that even supported yet?
@HeikoS	gsomix_: are you around?
 gsomix_	HeikoS, hey
@HeikoS	gsomix_: hi
 gsomix_	HeikoS, I should add our libsvm reader to modular interfaces.
@HeikoS	just wondering what to do to make swig accept sparse matrices?
@HeikoS	gsomix_: yep that would be nice, but currently even using python to create them
@HeikoS	csc_matrix?
@HeikoS	ah yes that did the job for me
@HeikoS	gsomix_: I am asking you since you did some typemaps for sparse matrices
 gsomix_	HeikoS, ahh, sorry. I thought you were about reading. =___=
@HeikoS	gsomix_: will be interesting very soon for me! :)
@HeikoS	but for now, just how to map
 gsomix_	HeikoS, there is a little doc in swig_typemaps.i for python modular interface.
 gsomix_	HeikoS, spmatrix_from_numpy func
@HeikoS	yep there I found the csc
@HeikoS	cool thanks
 gsomix_	ok

@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes well just use a sparse structure
@HeikoS	sonney2k: doesnt work, have to convert to csc
@sonney2k	HeikoS, any news about your bank account?
@HeikoS	but that works
@HeikoS	sonney2k: parents return end of august
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so one more week
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	the it works immediately
@sonney2k	HeikoS, which language python?
@HeikoS	yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, then look at the python examples that use sparse
@HeikoS	thats what I did finally
@sonney2k	HeikoS, but I guess I don't really understand the question
@sonney2k	well you should do that as a *first* step always right?
@sonney2k	so it works now right?
 pickle27	hey guys, I was working on the typemaps earlier, I added an out typemap for SGNDArray in python
@HeikoS	the mapping SGSparseMatrix to  scipy.sparsematrix doesnt work
 pickle27	then I started looking at octave
@HeikoS	only the csc(scipy.sparse)
@HeikoS	anyway
 pickle27	and I got a bit confused
 pickle27	sonney2k: got a second to look at it with me?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes sure only csc sparse matrix works
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I did not know that :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, there are 3 formats and csc is the one we support
@HeikoS	ok, going home now, see you!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, wait
@HeikoS	yes?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, did you plan your trip already?
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	nothing
@sonney2k	I am asking because renting a car would make sense if we all use it
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I am totally up for that!
@HeikoS	are you around tomorrow? I am a bit late here and should go soon

@wiking	sonney2k: mmm i used to use
@wiking	colloquy
@wiking	but i'm irssi now
@sonney2k	wiking, woah hardcore :)
@sonney2k	wiking, did you manage to uploade some videos?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, about SGVector.
 gsomix_	sonney2k, is there nice method for work with SGVector+offsets?
@sonney2k	gsomix_, errm??
@sonney2k	gsomix_, as in vec[i] ?
@sonney2k	or vec[i+offs] ?
 gsomix_	nope. look. I need substrings from SGVector.
 gsomix_	without copying
 gsomix_	on same memory
 gsomix_	but with offset.
 gsomix_	something like SGVector<char> substring=string.get_vector_with_offset(offset, length), where string is SGVector<char>
@sonney2k	gsomix_, you could do dangerous stuff like offsetted= SGVector(vec.vector+offs, vec.vlen, false)
 gsomix_	sonney2k, yep, without refcount.
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	with vec.vlen-offs
 gsomix_	I'm just curious is there refcounted solution.
@sonney2k	gsomix_, impossible!
@sonney2k	well hmmhh
 gsomix_	hm, I can imagine extended SGVector, that contains vector, physical length, offset and logical length. but in this case SGVector is not lightweight
 gsomix_	but it would be very useful for parsing
 gsomix_	now there are many, many copying and mallocs.
 gsomix_	but, of course, I can use unsafe solution
 gsomix_	sonney2k, ok, and I have another question. is there better solution for parsing numbers from strings than atoi/strtol?
 gsomix_	I mean atoi/strtol requires zero-terminated strings
 gsomix_	I cannot use it on pure memory block of data that read from file
 gsomix_	sonney2k, maybe do you know solution for non-zero-terminated strings? for strings with defined length
@sonney2k	gsomix_, no sorry - I would just put a '\0' there and change it back afterwards :/
@sonney2k	gsomix_, well a safe solution would be to keep one SGVector around
@sonney2k	and then work with an offsetted SGVector
@sonney2k	well or you derive some SGVectorView class from SGVector where you in addition store such an offset
@sonney2k	SGVector is not *that* lightweight since it has a vtable already...
 gsomix_	sonney2k, ok, thanks!
@sonney2k	actually not derive but make SGVector a member of SGVectorView
 gsomix_	sonney2k, it would be good solution for parsing.
 gsomix_	I mean then I can store SGVectorView in dynarray's or so
 gsomix_	sonney2k, one question about get_sparse_vector.
 gsomix_	I should just read one line from libsvm file and parse it, right?
 gsomix_	there is no reason to read whole file, hm
@sonney2k	gsomix_, when you want to store that in dyn* you need to add some stuff to lib/memory.{cpp,h}
@sonney2k	gsomix_, yeah for sparse it doesn't help because we store vectors separately anyway
 gsomix_	sonney2k, do you mean I should enable SG_SPECIALIZED_MALLOC for new class? because it's not SGObject, right?
@sonney2k	gsomix_, well except if you parse it into a dense SGMatrix
@sonney2k	gsomix_, it is because it needs inplace new operator :/
 gsomix_	sonney2k, ok, I'll try to get into it.
 gsomix_	now need finish sparse reading for libsvm and csv
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i have the python script + client api code from googs
@wiking	so i'm on it

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: update news
@wiking	sonney2k what ya think about breaking up the swig modular interface into smaller _wrapper.cxx-es
@wiking	at least then the compilation could be done parallel (with make -jX)
 gsomix_	wiking, I'm not Soeren, but would be great.
 gsomix_	wiking, but how?
@wiking	sonney2k: and i was thiking that we'd need need a nightly of osx
