 n4nd0	hello hello
 blackburn	n4nd0: hello hello
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you have any idea about how can we solve my problem with the undefined reference to pthread_atfork
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	still..? oh let me check
 blackburn	so it fails on compilation of shogun, right?
 n4nd0	not really
 n4nd0	on compilation of the examples
 n4nd0	for instance, libshogun/so_hmsvm_mosek
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is the general rule for the order of the libraries?
 blackburn	order of -l* stuff?
 blackburn	I am unsure it matters
 n4nd0	yeah order of -l stuff
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	it shouldn't matter I believe
 n4nd0	I have no idea how to solve this :(
 n4nd0	anyway, first of all
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you happen to know how can we find out if it is a problem compiling the example or if it comes from some error in the way I am building shogun with MOSEK support?
 n4nd0	I get basically this error
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	sorry, re
 blackburn	n4nd0: are you building example with -lmosek?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: but don't worry, I think I will read more about it later
 blackburn	n4nd0: libiomp5.so is actually openmp
 n4nd0	I don't manage to quick fix so I will take it a look
 blackburn	one idea could be to build shogun with openmp as well
 blackburn	didn't you try that?
 n4nd0	I don't think so
 n4nd0	how can I do that
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	n4nd0: try -lomp
 n4nd0	blackburn: in my example?
 blackburn	yeah, try that too
 n4nd0	too?
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	you may also try to build shogun
 n4nd0	ah ok
 blackburn	with -lomp
 n4nd0	/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lomp
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	-fopenmp
 blackburn	n4nd0: you may also try to link your example with -lpthread
 n4nd0	blackburn: I was already linking with lpthread
 n4nd0	I think that actually it should be with pthread
 n4nd0	tried with both though
 n4nd0	-fopenmp didn't make it either
 blackburn	bad :(
