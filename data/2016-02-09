 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #2981 from karlnapf/develop
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix some warnings
@besser82	lupinix, yeah! rawhide is fun, again  :(
* lupinix had to six several packages
@besser82	lupinix, two unittests are segfaulting and three python_modular-tests are failing...
 lupinix	swig?
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot force build deb3
@HeikoS	besser82:  how to do this again? :)
@besser82	lupinix, swig isn't the reason, nothing really new
* besser82 backported all new python-stuff from swig 3.0.8 to the 3.0.7 package
 lupinix	directly moving to 3.0.8 was not an option?

@HeikoS	Ill send out the email
 lisitsyn	I have no idea
 lisitsyn	its quite strange
 lisitsyn	it doesn't look like a typo
 lisitsyn	or?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: looks like he pushed
@HeikoS	the changes are mostly notebook no?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: quite a lot
 lisitsyn	travis conf
 lisitsyn	it looks like their configuration of shogun or something?
 lisitsyn	crazy
@HeikoS	to me looks like he pushed develop into master
 lisitsyn	or is it just the same changes applied again?
@HeikoS	did a merge without rebase
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we are in trouble anyway
 lisitsyn	if I do revert it won't help much
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: there is a way
@HeikoS	to remove patches in the history
@HeikoS	gnaa
 lisitsyn	well push force
 lisitsyn	git reset HEAD~2
 lisitsyn	git push --force
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	you know that better than me
@HeikoS	i tend to break git repos ;)
 lisitsyn	but it makes the branch broken
@HeikoS	Ill send out the email, I can do that
@HeikoS	whats the fix here?
 lisitsyn	heh
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well all are ugly
 lisitsyn	I think we have to go with push force
 lisitsyn	but it is bad
 lisitsyn	really bad
@HeikoS	agreed
@HeikoS	check email
