 uricamic	wiking: hi
 uricamic	have u tried shogun with 64bit mosek?
 wiking	uricamic: yes
 wiking	it works
 uricamic	hmm, it didn't work for me :(
 wiking	ah
 wiking	have u seen this:

 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/732
 uricamic	at least the python so_multiclass.py example haven't worked
 wiking	uricamic: so this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/732
 CIA-21	shogun: Viktor Gal master * rb3b76e8 / src/configure : Fix mosek library detection - http://git.io/Y-_ZKw
 CIA-21	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r6684bae / src/configure : Merge pull request #732 from vigsterkr/latent - http://git.io/tW9rTQ
 wiking	uricamic: i've just tested the libshogun example
 wiking	that worked
 uricamic	I have set mosek manually according to n4ndo's mail and it compiled, but the example complained about something
 uricamic	I was asking because I have just looked on your PR :)
 wiking	if u can copy paste the the error i can maybe help
 uricamic	but wait, I missed this line: MOSEK_LDADD="-liomp5"
 uricamic	that could be the problem
 wiking	uricamic: ah yeah maybe that was it
 wiking	it won't compile w/o that
 uricamic	ok, I will try with the latest code, if shogun will find mosek and if the example will work now
 wiking	uricamic: ah wait
 wiking	where's your mosek installed?
 wiking	because now i have to run my configure script like this:
 uricamic	in my home directory
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	so then do something similar
 wiking	./configure --interfaces=cmdline_static --prefix=/Users/wiking/shogun-latent-build --libs=/usr/lib:/opt/local/lib:/Users/wiking/mosek/6/tools/platform/osx64x86/bin --includes=/opt/local/include/:/Users/wiking/mosek/6/tools/platform/osx64x86/h
 uricamic	but I have set up variables as described in mosek installation manual says
 wiking	uricamic: just give the right path for the mosek headers and library... with --libs and --includes for configure
 uricamic	ok, I will try
 wiking	uricamic: this way it detects it smoothly
 uricamic	wiking: ok, I will give it a try
 uricamic	wiking: hmm, when I set libs and includes still the configure script says: Checking for Mosek support ... no
 uricamic	wiking: https://gist.github.com/26c4137b5516d04a4b03
 wiking	uricamic: aaaaaah
 wiking	uricamic: i was stupid again :)
 wiking	the -lpthread is missing there ;)
 uricamic	:)
 wiking	uricamic: this should fix it if i'm not wrong

 wiking	wasn't serialization_complex_example.py fixed already? :)
 uricamic	wiking: I have tried to add the -lpthread but I am still obtaining the same error
 wiking	where have u added it?
 wiking	the same as on gist?
 wiking	uricamic: what's your distrib?
 uricamic	mnt, I will check it with the old one
 wiking	honestly it's strange
 wiking	as according to the gist actually u have -pthread flag
 uricamic	https://gist.github.com/26c4137b5516d04a4b03#comments
 uricamic	yep, I see
 uricamic	I have Ubuntu 12.04
 uricamic	64bit
 wiking	jesus
 uricamic	what? :)
 wiking	why dont u have pthread_atfork
 wiking	;D
 uricamic	I don't know :D
 wiking	ok i'll check my ubuntu
 wiking	to see if it's true
 wiking	that libpthread.so does not have pthread_atfork
 uricamic	ldd /home/uricamic/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin/libiomp5.so
 uricamic	        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffcb93d000)

 uricamic	        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f24f152e000)
 wiking	thisis the most strange
 wiking	libpthread.so.0 has pthread_atfork symbol
 uricamic	how can I check that?
 wiking	pthread_atfork@GLIBC_2.2.5
 wiking	but try this
 wiking	objdump -D /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so|less
 wiking	and then search for pthread_atfork
 wiking	or just simply
 wiking	objdump -D /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so|grep pthread_atfork
 wiking	this is the weirdest thing ever
 uricamic	objdump -D /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread-2.15.so|grep pthread_atfork
 uricamic	000000000000d450 <pthread_atfork@GLIBC_2.2.5>:
 uricamic	    d45a:       74 0c                   je     d468 <pthread_atfork@GLIBC_2.2.5+0x18>
 uricamic	    d46a:       eb f7                   jmp    d463 <pthread_atfork@GLIBC_2.2.5+0x13>
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	so the library has actually that function
 uricamic	yep
 wiking	so i wonder why the linker cannot find it :S
 uricamic	this is strange
 uricamic	I thought that n4ndo was using 32bit mosek, because 64bit is somehow not working, but haven't asked him yet
 uricamic	but if it working for u, than it is strange...
 wiking	uricamic: i'm using 64bit but on a different platform
 uricamic	I know
 wiking	so i dont know
 uricamic	but still :)
 wiking	but still this must work
 wiking	i mean pthreads is a pretty standard posix library
 wiking	;)
 uricamic	yep, maybe n4ndo encountered similar problems
 wiking	yeah i wonder
 uricamic	and that's why he used 32bit...
 uricamic	I guess he is also using ubuntu, right?
 wiking	mmm yeah i guess so
 wiking	but yeah i mean there's something strange with the latest ubuntu :)
 uricamic	yep there is :D
 wiking	a library is missing from it currently :)
 wiking	although they provide the -dev part of the library
 wiking	thus the headers
 wiking	but not the actually library itself :P
 wiking	so i really wonder what has been going on with this release
 uricamic	my first attempt to promote to newer version actually have broken my system totally :D
 wiking	heheh yeah that happens :)
 wiking	ok i'm off to get some food
 uricamic	this was the first time it happened to me :D
 uricamic	ok
 wiking	ehhehe every time i've updated ubuntu
 wiking	i had some troubles :)
 wiking	ok bb in 30 mins
 uricamic	:D then I was lucky all the time

 heiko1	I am sorry, not yet
 heiko1	but I will today take a look at it
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	ask blackburn how he did it on the end :D
 heiko1	why?
 wiking	heiko1: ubuntu is missing a package
 wiking	you'll have to install libgtest by hand
 heiko1	yeah I know
 heiko1	thats why I added the custom config cript path
 heiko1	but does it work now for ubuntu?
 wiking	heiko1: u can use simply --libs=/usr/local/lib for that
 wiking	yeah apparently it does

 heiko1	nice

 n4nd0	back in Stockholm!! :)
 blackburn	heh cheers
 n4nd0	I just read the logs of yesterday's meeting
 n4nd0	it's a pity I couldn't be there :(
 blackburn	was it funny? :)
 n4nd0	fun more than funny ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: BTW, do you know something about the warnings I wrote about in a PR I sent a couple of days ago?
 blackburn	unresolved thing?
 n4nd0	something in structure/Plif* that I have no idea why they appear
 n4nd0	I am checking here  http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/67/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%28682%29 and they still appear
 n4nd0	is that the right place to look for warnings in any case?
 n4nd0	in the nightly_default build
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: or rather python_modular warnings
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: once you have tried to fix a warning, do you compile in any special way to know if that warning has been fixed?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no I just check on the buildbot
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I'll do a grep of the compiler output or something
 n4nd0	I don't know why this "const effectively ignored" appears
 blackburn	n4nd0: where/
 n4nd0	../../shogun/structure/PlifBase.h:48: Warning 509: Overloaded method shogun::CPlifBase::lookup_penalty(int32_t,float64_t *)
 n4nd0	../../shogun/structure/PlifBase.h:37: Warning 509: as it is shadowed by shogun::CPlifBase::lookup_penalty(float64_t,float64_t *) const.
 n4nd0	it seems that it is not caused by the const modifier
 n4nd0	since there are many of the type
 n4nd0	../../shogun/mathematics/Math.h:316: Warning 509: Overloaded method shogun::CMath::pow(float64_t,int32_t) effectively ignored,
 n4nd0	../../shogun/mathematics/Math.h:302: Warning 509: as it is shadowed by shogun::CMath::pow(int32_t,int32_t).
 blackburn	ah it is something csharp specific IIRC
 n4nd0	no need to worry about it?
 blackburn	yeha
 blackburn	n4nd0: what's with hm and risk functions?
 n4nd0	wiking was taking a look to that
 wiking	n4nd0: ?
 n4nd0	wiking: the pull request with the risk functions thing?
 blackburn	no, I mean HM
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	didn't you do that?
 blackburn	markov one
 blackburn	hiding in the forest

 wiking	blackburn: here?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	with the dense_dot_range i could do a dot product of all the features in CDotFeatures with a given w? and the 1st arg (float64_t*) output vector will contain the dot value for each <x_i, w>
 wiking	or?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	given that the range is from 0 to n where n is the number of feature vectors stored in CDotFeatures
 wiking	ok that should do it
 wiking	btw what if w is not dense?
 blackburn	w is always dense :)
 wiking	i.e. what if w is a sparse vector, we don't have function for that?
 blackburn	well assumed to be
 wiking	yeah i know but what if not...
 blackburn	no, we don't have it but it is really rare case
 wiking	okok
 wiking	i'm the rare case :)))
 blackburn	you have sparse w?
 blackburn	how sparse?
 wiking	well i'm still working on that example
 wiking	but with the dataset i'm trying to compare with (and implementation) the w is sparse :S
@sonney2k	heiko1: still crashing the buildbot?
 blackburn	I am surprised because L2 do not promote sparsity
 heiko1	sonney2k, yeah, these were really large changes so I could not make all commits work
 heiko1	otherwise commit histpory would have been horrible
 heiko1	another patch is coming soon today
 heiko1	btw sonney2k, I wrote to the KDE ev to get some informations
@sonney2k	wiking, you sure your w is sparse? but even if - the gain is very small: it is very expensive to compute only certain features...
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i'm sure i'm just looking at the example :)
@sonney2k	heiko1, but KDE is well just slightly bigger :D
 heiko1	I know, but maybe they know how to start with this stuff
 blackburn	wiking: how sparse it is?
 wiking	blackburn: just a sec i want to finish this densedot thingy
 heiko1	calling the court did not really help
 blackburn	it is not worth the thing in case of say 50% nnz I mean
 wiking	doh man i'm fscked
 wiking	heiko1: get us a patch as i've rebased and now i cannot compile :)))
 heiko1	wiking, 10  mins :)
 wiking	although i think there's something wrong
 wiking	since the buildbot managed to build it
 wiking	anybody else gets this: "shogun::SGVector<double>::display_vector(char const*) const", referenced from:
 heiko1	ah damn
 heiko1	sorry
 heiko1	now I get whats the problem
 heiko1	that was me
 heiko1	fixing fast .....
 wiking	i think finally i've managed to get coffin into latent :)
 wiking	but let's see heiko1's magic first
 heiko1	wiking, which interfaces are failing?
 heiko1	or is it libshogun?
 wiking	heiko1: it was libshogun but it was my fault i had to do a make clean && make
 wiking	now it works
 heiko1	wiking, ok
