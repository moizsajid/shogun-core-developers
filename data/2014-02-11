 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add unit test with marginal likelihood estimate with EP
 besser82	sonne|work:  Yes, we can do this with COPR  :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  We just need some SRPM on some http-location and curl a small hook
 besser82	sonne|work:  that will trigger a build on COPR and provide a public repo for them  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: what do you need for that - my plan would be in the nightly_default when all tests went fine to build the stuff
 sonne|work	or to trigger some build and I can give you the sha
 besser82	I can try to implement some auto-rpm-spec into cmake and then we just need `rpmbuild -bs shogun.spec` && upload to some http-location && curl that copr-hook
 besser82	sonne|work:  ^^^ i can setup a copr-account for that  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: please do :)
 sonne|work	you are the rpm king anyways
 besser82	sonne|work:  will do so  ;)  Thanks!  :D
 sonne|work	no thank YOU!
 besser82	sonne|work:  btw. there will be some real good nifty thing for our cloud-plans  :D
 besser82	sonne|work:  there will be docker.io integration for openShift && openStack  && oVirt!!!!
 besser82	sonne|work:  I talked to some devs of these @Brno
 besser82	sonne|work:  and openShift will get a scaling mechanism based on Mem/CPU-Usage to scale over different workers (like Bare metal or different VMs)

 besser82	sonne|work:  and new version of fedmsg  (avail in debian, too) for doing communication between different instances on different containers / VMs and such

 sonne|work	rahul <rahul@localhost.localdomain added a new kernel SSKStringKernel which implements the subsequence kernel
 sonne|work	lambday: now I am mixing up everyone
 lambday	sonne|work: no no this is me only :) but that time heiko said its not in shogun style...
 lambday	so we decided to add this later..
 lambday	I removed the code
 lambday	I didn't originally intend to send any PR for that - but it was already pushed to my fork so it got added (fighting with git)
 sonne|work	you removed it in ac917f29ab1ad60b4933f130d352e7aeab487b90
 sonne|work	obviously people want to use it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21675240/string-subsequence-kernel-and-svm-using-python
 sonne|work	lambday: so just get it back :D
 lambday	sonne|work: alright :) will polish the code a bit
 lambday	sonne|work: whic DS I should use for 3d array? NDARRAY?
 lambday	or vector of sg matrices? :-/
 sonne|work	lambday: don't you just need that as temp buffer?
 sonne|work	so anything is fine...
 lambday	sonne|work: yeah!
 lambday	sonne|work: alright then!
 sonne|work	maybe SGVector is easiest
 lambday	okay
 sonne|work	nah just keep it like you did it before
 sonne|work	just use SG_MALLOC for the thing and good

 huska	I'd like to use a spectrum kernel with some DNA sequences that contain unknown/masked nucleotides (=N characters). Is there any reason not to convert these to 0 and use the SNP alphabet? The IUPAC alphabet includes 'N' but it's a large alphabet and I don't use any of the other symbols.

 mattN	hello. can someone help with an installation problem?
 mattN	i used cmake to compile and attempt to compile the python modular and I get a error related to SWIG
 mattN	it says "unable to find python.swig"
 mattN	and is unable to build properly
 mattN	this is odd becuase I already have swig installed
 mattN	any suggestions?
@iglesiasg	mattN, what version of swig do you have installed?
 mattN	I have swig 2.0.4
 mattN	it came packaged with enthought python
@iglesiasg	that version of swig should be ok
 mattN	more specifically, I have use Canopy. This is a distribution by Enthought that includes a lot of scientific libraries
 mattN	any idea why I get the "cannot find python.swig" error when trying to build?
@iglesiasg	mattN, I have no real idea what Canopy, but could you try to find that file in your system?
@iglesiasg	mattN, is it .swg or .swig btw?
 mattN	.swg
@iglesiasg	mattN, if this canopy is some sort of linux, or at least similar, check if you have the directory /swig
 mattN	here is the exact error I get if it helps
 mattN	[ 86%] copying SWIG files [ 86%] Built target python_modular_src [ 86%] Swig source :3: Error: Unable to find 'python.swg' SGBase.i:317: Error: Unable to find 'std_vector.i' make[2]: *** [src/interfaces/python_modular/modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx] Error 1 make[1]: *** [src/interfaces/python_modular/CMakeFiles/_python_modular.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [all] Error 2
@sonney2k	lambday, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21675240/string-subsequence-kernel-and-svm-using-python/21675241#21675241
@sonney2k	lambday, ^ pretty good example :D
 lambday	sonney2k: :P should I just steal it ;)
@sonney2k	lambday, let me ask him
@sonney2k	lambday, I cannot so use it and we give him credit and mention this in the comment asking if he is ok
@sonney2k	with it
@sonney2k	mattN, your swig version is too old
@sonney2k	mattN, I don't remember when but I think you need at least swig 2.0.7 nowadays
 lambday	sonney2k: I can mail him
 mattN	so i found the python.swg file that it says it can't find
@iglesiasg	mattN, where is it
 lambday	sonney2k: I was thinking of attaching a real dataset example that I used for my project
 lambday	but this one is simple and pretty cool :)
@sonney2k	lambday, add the data set but then start a notebook rather than an example with that
@sonney2k	lambday, our policy now is examples are minimal usage examples
 mattN	sonny2k, the shogun i am using only requires 2.0.4
@sonney2k	lambday, notebooks really give cool explanations
 lambday	sonney2k: alrighty - yeah that would be better...
 lambday	sonney2k: may be a notebook using a number of string kernels
 lambday	fisher's dataset is a good one
@sonney2k	lambday, so just do a minimal example maybe even with dna features
@sonney2k	lambday, and in the notebook use this guys example
@sonney2k	lambday, and then we can extend the notebook with other string kernels
@sonney2k	we have soo damn many
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, we have a problem
@iglesiasg	what is it
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, stuff doesn't work with python 3.3.4rc because your name in the .h's leads to unicode errors
 lambday	sonney2k: okay sounds good - currently adding unit-test... one for the values computed and another for psd checking
 lambday	then will add a python example
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, aaargh yeah.. I stopped using the accent in the vowels when I realized that might bring problems
 mattN	iglesiasg, swig in /Users/matthewnorton/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, found a workaround lines=open(fname, encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore').readlines()
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, great!
@iglesiasg	hope it doesn't bring other problems
@iglesiasg	mattN, swig is there or the python.swg file?
@iglesiasg	mattN, I think you should copy the python.swg file inside the directory where swig is installed
