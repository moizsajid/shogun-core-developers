 lisitsyn	besser82: haye
 lisitsyn	have you seen that guy claiming shogun broke his machine?
 lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes I did...  Pretty rediculous...  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, I tried to explain stuff to him right now...
@besser82	lisitsyn, you were pinging me a few days ago...  What was the matter?
 lisitsyn	besser82: don't remember
 lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	okie...
 lisitsyn	ahh it was to show you some code before merging
@besser82	lisitsyn, I c...  The some / any / whatever thing, rye?
@besser82	lisitsyn, btw...  If shogun breaks computers during compile, we can say for sure:  Rhino-virus causes pregnancy...  :P
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	besser82: it was Maybe! ;)
 lisitsyn	I am responsible for a whole set of one-simple-word classes haha
@besser82	lisitsyn, I c  =)  What does this thing do?
 lisitsyn	it is when you either have value or not
@besser82	Ahh...  Ok...
 lisitsyn	besser82: e.g.
 lisitsyn	you have some dataflow
 lisitsyn	and you ask for normalizer
 lisitsyn	but it could be absent
 lisitsyn	some GetNormalizer()
 lisitsyn	auto normalizer = GetNormalizer();
 lisitsyn	if (normalizer) { ... }
 lisitsyn	it could be done with pointers but it's a bit more clean this way
 lisitsyn	and faster
@besser82	looks like a good way ^_?
@besser82	^_^
 lisitsyn	besser82: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2918#issuecomment-139215638
 lisitsyn	maybe you know this error?
@besser82	lisitsyn, erm...  mmh...  I'd suggest killing all shogun-stuff and left-overs...  Then rebuilding for Py3 and see whether it works...
