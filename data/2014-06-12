 kislay	hey khalednasr
 khalednasr	kislay, hey
 kislay	check this out
 kislay	https://github.com/kislayabhi/docs/blob/master/OpenCV%20NN%20vs%20Shogun%20NN.md
 kislay	I have updated it
 kislay	its better than earlier now.
 kislay	khalednasr, do you think it's fair now?
 khalednasr	kislay, seems like it
 khalednasr	kislay, why 1e-8 for epsilon? did you try larger values?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	OpenCV's better when the epsilon is near 0.0001
 kislay	but as we get more less..
 kislay	we get an edge.
 kislay	what is the general value that an epsilon should assume btw!
 khalednasr	kislay, maybe we can try disabling epsilon completely, and just train both networks for 1000 iterations or so
 khalednasr	kislay, the default is 1e-5
 kislay	lets try on that too..
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
 khalednasr	kislay, what do you mean by an edge?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 kislay	the training time of ours gets better as we decrease the value of the epsilon over OPencv's
 khalednasr	kislay, I see. let me know what happens when you set epsilon to 0
 kislay	opencv takes 2.3 secs with accuracy of 68.8%
 kislay	ours take 0.39 secs with acc of 81%
 kislay	^^^
 kislay	for epsilon=0
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
 khalednasr	kislay, can you try increasing the number of iterations? so that opencv's acc can improve a little
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	lemme try
 kislay	I don't get it... I have increased the number of iter. from 1000 to 1000. Now OpenCV takes 23 secs but still gives an accuracy of 68.8%
 kislay	khalednasr, 1000 to *10000..

 khalednasr	kislay, that's weird..
 khalednasr	kislay, I suspect that opencv might be doing stochastic gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent. can you try setting gd_mini_batch_size = 1 in shogun?
 kislay	let me..

-!- khalednasr [~androirc@41.69.227.99] has joined #shogun
 kislay	hey khalednasr , I just tried for iter. = 100, epsl=0 for opencv... It gives an acc of 82%
 kislay	Are you sure, setting epsilon =0 for opencv is same as that of ours.
 kislay	because these are not consistent results.
 khalednasr	I'm not sure. Their doc. doesn't give the details
 kislay	yeah.
 kislay	Doc is not that good. I don't even find any mention of setting the mini batch size?
 khalednasr	Yeah. The only thing mentioned is that rprop uses full batch training
 kislay	yup

 khalednasr	kislay, for openv, the respones should be in the range -1 to 1 when you're using sigmoid neurons, not 0 to 1
 kislay	I use a tuple, since they don't have multiclass labels facility over there..so having a tuple like [-0.8,-0.5,0.1,0.3] suggests that its the last one winning right?]
 kislay	khalednasr, I am just using the max. one as the result .
 kislay	khalednasr, so..it won't effect whether its 0-1 ot -1 to 1..
 kislay	what say?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 khalednasr	kislay, yeah I see, but the binary labels that you're giving them is in the 0-1 range, right?
 kislay	ah! yes
 kislay	okay
 kislay	got your point

 kislay	iglesiasg,  Some insights in KNN over here.. https://github.com/kislayabhi/docs/blob/master/OpenCV%20KNN%20vs%20Shogun%20KNN.md
@iglesiasg	kislay, tell me
 kislay	iglesiasg, I am getting a poor accuracy for KNN for some reason.
@iglesiasg	kislay, is it what you call efficiency at the end of the doc
 kislay	ah..yeah thats accuracy actually..
@iglesiasg	kislay, is it using the exact same train and test data in OpenCV and Shogun?
@iglesiasg	I understand it does
 kislay	yeah. Thats the point.
@iglesiasg	funny, indeed
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
 kislay	And yeah iglesiasg , Did you checked that issue. I have to go for a workaround here also.
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@iglesiasg	kislay, no, I didn't check it
@iglesiasg	kislay, you can use multiclass accuracy btw

 kislay	iglesiasg, I see it.
-!- khalednasr [~k.nasr92@41.69.227.99] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	I found this quite funny actually
@iglesiasg	well, find hehe
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 kislay	I did wrong something?
 khalednasr	kislay, I think it would be better to stop trying to use the same training parameters for both opencv and shogun, and instead choose the parameters that maximize the accuracy for each implementation independently
 kislay	khalednasr, yeah. We can do that. So that means comparison over accuracy than speed, right?
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has joined #shogun
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 khalednasr	kislay, not necessarily. we can also compare the time required to reach the same accuracy for each implementation
