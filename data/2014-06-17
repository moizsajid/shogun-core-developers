 visof_	Hell
 visof_	Hello
 visof_	is there anybody around?
 lambday	visof_: yes.. hi!
 visof_	lambday: have you played with freebase before?
 visof_	or semantic web
 lambday	visof_: um... nope! sorry :)
 visof_	lambday: have used word2vec?
 visof_	lambday: if i can two words like "goelocation_latitude" and "latitude" , how can get they are somehow the same thing
 visof_	maybe also "location_geolocation_latitude" and "latitude" also and comparison like this
 lambday	visof_: I'm afraid I'm not the right person to address this... this is hardcore NLP stuff :/ I don't know much about that
 visof_	lambday: you don't use word2vec?
 lambday	visof_: no man! sorry :(
 visof_	haha may i ask why are you here?
 lambday	visof_: I work in a different domain
 visof_	okay thanks
 lisitsyn	haha I am confused
 lisitsyn	visof_: why do you think we know about word2vec? ;)
 lambday	lisitsyn: :D

 lambday	man Masters thesis is such a PITA :(
-!- visof_ is now known as visof
 lambday	wish I can finish BAHSIC this week.. will get to use it for my thesis :/
 lambday	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	lambday: hey!
@HeikoS	lambday: BAHSIC yeah! :)
@HeikoS	lambday: if you want to, start with that
 lambday	HeikoS: I found another bug in linear time mmd code... fixed it
-!- visof is now known as weqewewqew
@HeikoS	lambday: just had a chat with Dino, who is not about to review the stuff you did so far a bit
 lambday	HeikoS: not about to?
 lisitsyn	lambday: do masters in russia :D
 lisitsyn	easy hah
@HeikoS	now
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah.. I should have tried in europe for masters
@HeikoS	lambday: ^
 lambday	HeikoS: oh... :D btw did you happen to check the design for BAHSIC?
 lambday	HeikoS: for three variable interaction, I think we need a separate class..
 lambday	HeikoS: so for three-variable interaction... we'll check two of the features and the labels, right? x_1 and x_2 from p and y from q?
@HeikoS	lambday: I guess so, I am about to discuss it with dino also
@HeikoS	will do later today
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. I also sent b-test patch..
@HeikoS	lambday: cool
@HeikoS	lambday: now back to life as exams/deadline is over
 lambday	HeikoS: travis complains about a libshogun example taking too much time...
 lambday	HeikoS: haha.. yeah and now my deadlines begin.. both here in gsoc and in my insti.. :/
@HeikoS	lambday: ah well, you already did lots of things!
@HeikoS	lambday: but lets push the feature selection stuff. if its useful for your thesis that would be amazinh
@HeikoS	lambday: what are the immediate next steps?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. so.. I think if we can finalize the design for BAHSIC I can start with that...
@HeikoS	lambday: let me talk to dino now then
@HeikoS	could you send an email to both of us with the latest design?
@HeikoS	(in case things changed?)
 lambday	HeikoS: well, I didn't change anything in the previous design...
@HeikoS	ok well discuss this one then
@HeikoS	give me 30 mins
 lambday	HeikoS: thanks :) no hurries though
@HeikoS	lambday: things for your list also: b-test API exmple, and notebook section
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah... so in the notebook do you think we should use new implementation... or a comparison of previous and current implementation should also go there?
 lambday	for linear time mmd and quadratic time mmd I mean
 lambday	(oh but in that case, we *have* to have both the implementation in the same branch which we don't have currently)
 lambday	HeikoS: btw dino also suggested that we put kernel selection stuff under a base CKernelSelection instead of CMMDKernelSelection..
 lambday	so inside feature selection stuff, we can use that instead
 lambday	which I think is a great idea for future kernel selection stuffs we might have

 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hey what's up
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey, starting to work on deep belief nets
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: could you please explain your last PR :D
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: I merged it as it is totally ok code-wise :D
 lisitsyn	but I don't really know what's this sampling with evidence
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, ahh, well normally after you train an rbm on some data you'll want to draw samples from the marginal P(data) to see what the rbm thinks the data looks like
 khalednasr	thats what the regular sample() functions do
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: will you see some different blobs for different classes?
 khalednasr	but if your data is divided into two groups, say pixels and labels
 lisitsyn	ahh so this is where evidence comes from
 khalednasr	by sampling with evidence I mean sampling from P(pixels | labels)
 lisitsyn	cool I see
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: this marginalized P(data)
 lisitsyn	how does it look?
 lisitsyn	what are the samples?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, if you're training on digits, the samples will look like digits
 lisitsyn	ahh got it
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: how does it work? :D
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: I guess that's possible for RBMs but not for any other kind of NN, right?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, it's like fitting a multivariate gaussian to some data, after you learn the mean and the variance, you can draw samples from the distribution and they will look somewhat like the data you trained on
 lisitsyn	got it
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	thanks for this explanation!
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, for rbms, you learn the weights and then use gibbs sampling starting from some random states and you end up with samples from the model
 khalednasr	it only works for rbms
 khalednasr	you're welcome :)
