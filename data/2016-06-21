 sanuj	lisitsyn, what warning do you want for the %newobject PR?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, hey, you are online? :o
 OXPHOS	sanuj: hello:) I'm in China now
 sanuj	OXPHOS, i see :)
 OXPHOS	sanuj have to connect to irc via vpn ;(
 sanuj	OXPHOS, where do you live in china?
 OXPHOS	sanuj: in a city 300km to Beijing
 lisitsyn	sanuj: say one wants to add another layer
 lisitsyn	sanuj: we've got to warn people to update swig as well
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you mean, if someone adds a new layer in NeuralNetwork.h then swig has to be also updated with %newobject?
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, did you talk to heiko about templates in swig
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah but it is quite difficult anyway
 sanuj	lisitsyn, he wants to merge tags first in the feature branch and then look at swig
 lisitsyn	I agree
 sanuj	i think the only thing missing are unit-test for any
 sanuj	i can't make the coverage thing work
 lisitsyn	details?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, well heiko said wiking will update the cmakelist for coverage to work
 sanuj	lisitsyn, he had asked me to try gconv
 sanuj	but for that i need to compile the source code with some flags for gconv to work
 sanuj	lisitsyn, here is the flag https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt#L195
 sanuj	but i don't know what am i supposed to do after building with this flag
 sanuj	and i think it does not work

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: hihi
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: hey!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we are about to finish the linalg draft
@HeikoS	Ill send a link and you can check a bit
@HeikoS	we are in the final changes
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: sent you a pm
@HeikoS	let me know whether it wporked

 OXPHOS	HeikoS: thx! checking
 OXPHOS	lambday: hello
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@223.231.61.124] has joined #shogun
@lambday	OXPHOS: hello!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: sooooo
@HeikoS	we are done
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: shall we walk you through this a bit?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: key points
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: coooool! I'm thinking about some questions but plz go ahead
@HeikoS	1.) runtime change of backend possible
@HeikoS	2.) runtime addition of backend possible
@HeikoS	3.) simple API
@HeikoS	4.) GPU algorithms can always be executed on CPU backend if no GPU backend is available
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: you see, there is no #ifdefs or any backend specific code in SGVector or the base classes
@HeikoS	or the linalg methods, e.g. linalg::dot
@HeikoS	they all just call backends
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so I will just point to some line numbers with a few comments
 OXPHOS	yes
@HeikoS	line 10-19: use cases: how this is used from shogun algos
@HeikoS	should be pretty clear
@HeikoS	line 23ff: changes /additions to SGVector, we decided to putGPU memory things in there to make everything a bit more compact
@HeikoS	note it is only one constructor, and a new member in line 43
 OXPHOS	yep
@HeikoS	Also note:
@HeikoS	transfering to GPU always creates a NEW SGVector
@HeikoS	where the vector field is NULL, and gpu_vector is non-null
@HeikoS	transfering back as well
@HeikoS	ok, now a tricky one
@HeikoS	line 53
@lambday	there can only be CPU data OR GPU data in SGVector.. not both at the same time..
@lambday	this is to have the proper refcount
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: line 49ff is the backend base, that is, it defines all the methods that are implemented in sublcasses
@HeikoS	the subclasses can use eigen3/vienna/cuda, etc
@HeikoS	so the base class containts some virtual methods
@HeikoS	since we cannot template virtual methods (google it if you are confused), we need to explicitly write these methods for all types we want
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we do this automatically via these macros
@HeikoS	please make sure you understand that :)
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: good?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: yes I got the idea..can work on details by myself
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: now check line 83ff, which defines the dot product
@HeikoS	you see, this thing checks whether both inputs live on gpu, and then calls gpu_backend's dot, otherwise cpu backend's dot
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@223.231.61.124] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@HeikoS	again, there is NO #ifdef/Vienna or whatsoever
@HeikoS	so it is possible to change the pointer that get_gpu_backend() returns at runtime
@HeikoS	same for cpu
 OXPHOS	sure onGPU() == registered
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: on_gpu == to_gpu() was called
@HeikoS	i.e. the SGVector memory lives on GPU
@HeikoS	registered == get_gpu_backend() != NULL
@HeikoS	see e.g. line 095
@HeikoS	95
@HeikoS	it checks whether the GPU backend is available
@HeikoS	and then transfers
@HeikoS	if not, doesnt transfer
@HeikoS	so in dot in line 83, we know that vector.on_gpu() is true, there *is* a backend registered
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: the backend pointers are stored in line 127ff
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and then we wrote some mini example backend implementations in eigen3 and Vienna
@HeikoS	line 137ff
@HeikoS	not again, that we are overloading virtual methods, so we cannot template but need to use this macro trick
@HeikoS	the actual code for dot product is in line 154ff
@HeikoS	for eigen case
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so far so good, please let us know any questions you have
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: now the plan
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: this needs to be implemented before midterm next week. that is this week
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: as we drafted most thing, it should be just a matter of translating this into compiling code
@HeikoS	so a week is more than enough I think
@HeikoS	should only take 2 days, so if you get stuck, ask us immediately
@HeikoS	it is a good goal for midterm to have this done
@HeikoS	in feature branch
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: thoughts?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure! make sense
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ok then, make sure you understand every line of this draft
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and also, more importantly, the high level idea
@HeikoS	i.e. the 4 points I started with
@HeikoS	at 11:29
 OXPHOS	yep that is clear
@HeikoS	OXPHOS:  ok then
@HeikoS	I also suggest: we start a new feature branch
 OXPHOS	thinking about the ref_counts of to_GPU() but no gpu backend - should be a shallow copy?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: check line
@HeikoS	104
@lambday	to_gpu creates a new SGVector with ref-count 0
@HeikoS	it returns the same vector
@HeikoS	lambday: no new vector
@lambday	oh if no gpu backend, same vector
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: same in line 117
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so lambday will create a branch for you
@HeikoS	spawned from develop
@HeikoS	and then the order of things to be added should be
@HeikoS	1.) SGVector changes / additions
@HeikoS	2.) base classes of backend and memory
@HeikoS	sorry, actually
@HeikoS	1.) gpu memory base class
@HeikoS	2.) SGVector changes
@HeikoS	3.) LinalgBackendBase
@HeikoS	(with to_gpu and from_gpu first)
@HeikoS	4.) add dot to LinalgBackendBase
@HeikoS	5. add subclasses for eigen3 and vienna
@HeikoS	6. unit test for dot and to/from_gpu
@HeikoS	7. polish
@HeikoS	8. refactor old methods
 OXPHOS	I see
@HeikoS	8 takes time
@HeikoS	so that we can do next week
@HeikoS	but 1-7 is quite simple with this draft
@HeikoS	so this week it should have priority over anything else
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: cool then
@HeikoS	I gotta go
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure! ready to work
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: just ask if anything is unclear, it took us a while to figure this out ourselves ;)
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: np. thx!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yo
@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  hi!

 c4goldsw	So, even though I've templated things related to CDenseFeatures, the second line shows where the a generic eigen map and a float64 eigen map are multiplied
 c4goldsw	What can be done about this?  One solution is to template CRegressionLabels, but this would only be suitable for things R.  This also leads to the question of whether you'd want this to work for int32 / 64, which is also in R but can run into problems as they can't store fractional parts
 c4goldsw	So HeikoS, what do you recommend?
 c4goldsw	I could also cast the eigen map into float64
 c4goldsw	On line 150
 c4goldsw	Which actually seems like a decent solution
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@1.39.12.41] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	ok hi
@HeikoS	c4goldsw:  let me see
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yo
 c4goldsw	On second thoughts the casting won't work
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: soooo
@HeikoS	as said yesterday, the first step would be
@HeikoS	to accept any CDeanseFeatures<T> as input
@HeikoS	no need to template the LARS class itself
@HeikoS	right?
 c4goldsw	Done
@HeikoS	because the input data is what counts
 c4goldsw	yes, that was clear
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	so for labels
@HeikoS	I am not sure what you want to do
@HeikoS	I mean labels can just be 64 bit, as there are not that many of them
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so I guess a first step (patch) is just to get rid of the float64_t in CDenseFeatures
@HeikoS	and just leave labels as they are
@HeikoS	does that make sense?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: jo!
 c4goldsw	Yes
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so when you are saying that is done
@HeikoS	can you share a pr?
@HeikoS	to discuss?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, jst saw mails, sending the data again
@HeikoS	I think we could change the labels to be templated as well
@HeikoS	but not sure whether that is worth the effort
@HeikoS	matrices is where it matters
@HeikoS	and regression labels are always R anyways
@HeikoS	it is just whether they are 32 or 64 bit
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so you just need to do something like
@HeikoS	typedef Eigen::Matrix<T, -1, -1> MatrixXT;
@HeikoS	and then do Map<MatrixXT>(feats->get_feature_matrix(), num_feats, num_vectors)
 c4goldsw	That's been done :)
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	then send the PR :)
 c4goldsw	But I'm still a little uncertain about how to proceed because of line 150
@HeikoS	and add a test where you make it work with float32 features
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	map_Xy=map_Xr*map_y;
@HeikoS	this one?
 c4goldsw	Yes.  The problem is that map_y is in float_64, whilst map_Xr is templated
 c4goldsw	That was what I was asking about
 c4goldsw	Or rather
@HeikoS	ah yes
@HeikoS	of course
@HeikoS	sorry
 c4goldsw	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/regression/LeastAngleRegression.cpp#L130
 c4goldsw	THAT is the problem
@HeikoS	well ok
 c4goldsw	get_lables returns float64 vectors
@HeikoS	labels are not changed
@HeikoS	only read
@HeikoS	so you can create a copy
@HeikoS	in the right memory length
@HeikoS	let me ask lambday
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: Or, if you go back to line 150, I could just cast map_Xr to float64 then right?
 c4goldsw	Because the values are only read, so there would really be no change.
 c4goldsw	I could cast by doing this on to eigen matrix: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23946658/error-mixing-types-with-eigen-matrices
@HeikoS	lambday is of the opinion that this works
@HeikoS	and should just give double
@HeikoS	or do you get a compile error?
 c4goldsw	That what works?  The casting idea?
@HeikoS	nope sorry
@HeikoS	misunderstanding
 sanuj	HeikoS, i have updated the tags PR and squashed my commits https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: ok the solution is
@HeikoS	to add template methods to CLabels
@HeikoS	get_labels<T>
@HeikoS	this is very similar to CKernel::get_kernel_matrix()
 c4goldsw	checking that method now
@HeikoS	you need to add templated methods get_labels<T>()
@HeikoS	and those will return a *copy* of the 64bit labels
@HeikoS	for all cases but for float64_t
@HeikoS	so that is ONE option
@HeikoS	the other one is to template labels
@HeikoS	just discussing here
@HeikoS	I tend toward the copy
@HeikoS	so CLabels::get_labels<float32_t>()
@HeikoS	and in there, you do
@HeikoS	SGVector<T> labels_copy(num_labels);
@HeikoS	for (i in range(num_labels)) { labels_copy[i] = labels[i]; }
@HeikoS	something like that
@HeikoS	then in the LARS
@HeikoS	you call that templated method, that now works with a copy of the labels in 32bit width
@HeikoS	sanuj:  checking
 c4goldsw	Hmm, okay
-!- besser82 [~besser82@fedora/besser82] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: Is it a problem that the labels aren't float64_t?  This goes back to my question yesterday of how the labels are used
 c4goldsw	What if the type we're using for LARs is an int type?
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: doesnt make sense
 c4goldsw	Which can't store fractional parts?
 c4goldsw	Ah ok
@HeikoS	I mean the data can be int
 c4goldsw	Good.  That clears up my understanding
@HeikoS	but inside LARS the X*y result needs to be float
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: Okay, it's good to hear that.  When I tried to compile with float64, the class compiles but this error occurs: https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/a9862903e3bec5be0f09b002bc1b9f6a
@HeikoS	there it appears to me that you templated the LARS class
@HeikoS	without instantiating the templates
@HeikoS	so you need to instantiate the templates to get rid of that
@HeikoS	BUT
@HeikoS	this is not what we discussed
@HeikoS	it makes no sense to template the LARS class itself
@HeikoS	we cannot template every algorithm in shogun
@HeikoS	explosion of classes
@HeikoS	we just want it to work with all template versions for CDesneFeatures
 c4goldsw	To be more specific, I was just compiling with the instatiation of LARS<float64>
 c4goldsw	HeikoS in fact here, this is what I have: https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/fd325503b9b81a2a7f434291732e19e0
 c4goldsw	Go to the bottom, I've instatiated LARS<float64_t> at the bottom
@HeikoS	CLeastAngleRegression<ST>
@HeikoS	you dont want that
@HeikoS	you just want CLeastAngleRegression
@HeikoS	which deals with CDenseFeatures<T>
 c4goldsw	Now this is all clear
@HeikoS	rather than only CDenseFeatures<float64_t>
 c4goldsw	So I just need to template the methods that use CDenseFeatures
 c4goldsw	Right?
 c4goldsw	Rather than the entire class
@HeikoS	yes the helper methods you can template
@HeikoS	as they take SGMatrix<T>
 c4goldsw	Great, that makes sense.  Sorry for the misunderstanding
@HeikoS	oh and use a typedef for the Eigen::Matrix<T,-1,-1>
@HeikoS	no worries
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so my thinking is this:
 c4goldsw	I was going to do that, I know it's messy  / hard to read
@HeikoS	modular interfaces dont do templates
@HeikoS	python e.g.
@HeikoS	there is no template
@HeikoS	so we translate templated type as
@HeikoS	RealFeatures
@HeikoS	LongRealFeatures
@HeikoS	IntFeatures
@HeikoS	ShortFeatures
@HeikoS	ByteFeatures
@HeikoS	etc etc
@HeikoS	that means 10 new interface types for every templated class
@HeikoS	so we want to keep this down
@HeikoS	and only template stuff that really needs to be
@HeikoS	algorithm classes dont need to be
@HeikoS	they just need to be able to deal with features that are templated, but this happens all inside
 c4goldsw	Good, that makes sense
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: cool
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: so the tldr is
@HeikoS	you want to get rid of
@HeikoS	CDenseFeatures<float64_t> feats = (CDenseFeatures<float64_t>*) m_feats

@HeikoS	returns what it got if there was nothing before, otherwise returns the thing that was there before
@HeikoS	why?
 sanuj	HeikoS, bazdmeg told me to do so.....to indicate whether a parameter with a particular name already exists
@HeikoS	sanuj: what is the use case?
 sanuj	i mean ==> is a parameter being overwritten?
@HeikoS	why not boolean?
@HeikoS	why the value?
@HeikoS	bazdmeg: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HeikoS	what is this bazdmeg???
@HeikoS	#haha
@HeikoS	no, seriously, I dont get  it
 sanuj	bazdmeg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HeikoS	put a comment in the PR :)
@HeikoS	reading more of it
 sanuj	HeikoS, it returns the overwritten value
 sanuj	if the user wants to save it somewhere
@HeikoS	then the user should call get
@HeikoS	in this case, user needs to do a comparison between argument passed and result returned, and the decide to store if they are different
 sanuj	ask bazdmeg :D
@HeikoS	this is slightly ridiulous
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	sanuj: its your project :D
@HeikoS	so I ask you
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	you should have an opinion on this
 sanuj	I'm not sure
 sanuj	HeikoS, i think when we added this we didn't have has() and hastype()
@HeikoS	actually
@HeikoS	make it void
@HeikoS	user should check himself
@HeikoS	whether there is already something
@HeikoS	just use has
@HeikoS	and then get
@HeikoS	if interested in storing
@HeikoS	needs to be known at compile time anyways
@HeikoS	so point
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'll make it void right now and update it
@HeikoS	sanuj:  ok next question >:D
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-18b103056d529e1098553c5512d7b1d9R104
@HeikoS	sanuj: why this?
@HeikoS	does every BaseTag have a hash?
@HeikoS	or sometimes only string?
@HeikoS	so why do you compare the strings?
 sanuj	HeikoS, every BaseTag has a hash
@HeikoS	operator== is called all the time, e.g. for every get
@HeikoS	string comparisons cost
@HeikoS	so I think string comparison should go
@HeikoS	and only compare hash
@HeikoS	string is just for user to identify
@HeikoS	readability
 sanuj	HeikoS, nice suggestion
@HeikoS	sanuj: minor: why do you use name_ and _name
@HeikoS	any conflict?
@HeikoS	which one?
 sanuj	HeikoS, 'name' raises warnings
@HeikoS	we call members m_name
@HeikoS	m_member_variable
@HeikoS	what warning?
@HeikoS	"shadows a member of this"?
 sanuj	HeikoS, yep
 sanuj	name()
 sanuj	i'll change it to m_name
@HeikoS	m_name then for member please
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, you had some ideas about making multicore ?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yeah
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: lets discuss in 5min
@HeikoS	sanuj: another one :)
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8cfacc7a0d1355252c12528031d690b5R333
@HeikoS	this "training data"
@HeikoS	I dont see why users/devs should be allowed to just add new parameters to instances
@HeikoS	but rather we only want to allow to change parameters that are registered in the class itself, right?
@HeikoS	with SG_ADD
 sanuj	HeikoS, you want them to add parameters with fixed names?
@HeikoS	but SG_ADD is not there yet, so I guess we can't test otherwise
@HeikoS	sanuj: yeah of course
@HeikoS	sanuj: like SG_ADD
@HeikoS	only those parameters should be possible to add
@HeikoS	so to reproduce the unit test you did there, you need to create a mock object
@HeikoS	where you in the constructor add a tag parameter
@HeikoS	and then we set this in the test
@HeikoS	sanuj: understand that?
@HeikoS	sanuj: I will explain in PR
 sanuj	HeikoS, i seeeeeeeeee
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	HeikoS, i need to discuss this with bazdmeg
 sanuj	HeikoS, why didn't you tell me all this last week when you reviewed the same PR??
@HeikoS	sanuj: I just put a little draft for a test
@HeikoS	sanuj: PR was too big
@HeikoS	to review
 sanuj	HeikoS, okay :D
@HeikoS	then, its hard to realise such things
@HeikoS	also, too many GSoC projects :D
 sanuj	HeikoS, less than last to last time
@HeikoS	and finally, again, this is your project, not mine ;)
@HeikoS	so you have to try to check out such things as well
 sanuj	HeikoS, yesss okay
@HeikoS	but dont worry
@HeikoS	all good
@HeikoS	this is a good patch
@HeikoS	we just need to make it better
 sanuj	HeikoS, thanks :D
@HeikoS	sanuj: updated comment
@HeikoS	the code I pasted is now a bit different
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok then, you got some things to update
@HeikoS	let me know when all comments are addressed, and we will see what else we can find in there ;)
@HeikoS	I gotta talk to Saurabh7 now
 sanuj	HeikoS, okay, thanks
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, hey
 Saurabh7	so what do you think how would we start with the thread safety
@HeikoS	so the way to do it
@HeikoS	is similar to the way we did it in xvalidation
@HeikoS	but without clone
@HeikoS	but rather a shallow copy
@HeikoS	so everytime you want to thread-safe subset
@HeikoS	you create a shallow copy of the CFeature object
@HeikoS	lambday in fact did that already :)
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/bigtest/src/shogun/statistical_testing/internals/FeaturesUtil.cpp#L46
@HeikoS	you can copy that
 Saurabh7	yes thats should be easy with densefeatures attleast
@HeikoS	THEN
@HeikoS	the sub-set stack is still shared, right?
@HeikoS	since it is shallow copy
@HeikoS	in fact, lambday already clones the subset stack in his method
 Saurabh7	it shouldnt be the same obj right
 Saurabh7	the stack
@HeikoS	exactly it needs to be a new one
@HeikoS	so the way to do it
@lambday	Saurabh7: yeah I kinda clone the subset
@HeikoS	is to call the method something like
@HeikoS	create_subset_shallow_copy
@HeikoS	and then in there create a shallow copy of the features
@HeikoS	then create a clone of the (collapsed!!!) subset stack
@HeikoS	then the new features object can be assigned subsets
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	make sure to not clone the full subset stacj
@HeikoS	but rather collapse it before, I think there is a method
 Saurabh7	what exactly do you mean by collapse
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: imagine you have 100 vector on subsetstack
@HeikoS	then lookup means looking up 100 vector indices
@HeikoS	thats slow
@HeikoS	so the subset stack always stores the "collapsed" version
@HeikoS	that contains all these 100 mappings
@HeikoS	you can get it with get_last_subset
@HeikoS	get_last_subset()
 Saurabh7	oh yes yes i saw that
 Saurabh7	got it
@HeikoS	so in this shallow_subset_copy() method
@HeikoS	you create a new subset stack
@HeikoS	and initialise it with get_last_subset() of the original features
@HeikoS	got that?
 Saurabh7	yep
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: then, when this is done, I want you to make all methods that you use inside the parallel code: const
@HeikoS	I guess you use
@HeikoS	get_feature_vector()?
@HeikoS	get_feature_matrix() returns a copy if subset is active, so that should not be used
 Saurabh7	no mat operators
 Saurabh7	i mean mat operators are used ()
@HeikoS	which ones do you use?
@HeikoS	get_feature_matrix must not be used when subsets are active
@HeikoS	otherwise, c9opy
@HeikoS	slow
@HeikoS	so how do you access the features?
@HeikoS	so basically, you can only use get_feature_vector
@HeikoS	since this does not copy the memory
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, get_feature_matrix is used
 Saurabh7	and then its accesed  , right now
 Saurabh7	so I will try to change that
@HeikoS	check line 89 of CDenseFeatures
@HeikoS	template<class ST> ST* CDenseFeatures<ST>::get_feature_vector(int32_t num, int32_t& len, bool& dofree)
@HeikoS	and the wrapped one
@HeikoS	template<class ST> SGVector<ST> CDenseFeatures<ST>::get_feature_vector(int32_t num)
@HeikoS	these guys do not copy
@HeikoS	get_feature_matrix() always copies
@HeikoS	if you have a subset active
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: try it
@HeikoS	if you need to to linear algebra operations on the (subsetted) feature matrix, you need to copy
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok I will cahnge that
@HeikoS	but for random forest, I dont think you need to
@HeikoS	or?
 Saurabh7	so the subset are set on features
 Saurabh7	get matrix
 Saurabh7	operations
 Saurabh7	^ this is what it is right now
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: btw, can you make the existing patch merge ready before you start?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yes
@HeikoS	1.) create shallow copies of features, each with a new subset stack initialised to the get_active_subset of old features
@HeikoS	2.) only use get_feature_vector
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok I will see if anything is left to polish in the patch
@HeikoS	3.) make everything inside parallel const
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool
 Saurabh7	so actually it was being copied everytime, interesting
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yes
@HeikoS	memcpy is fast
@HeikoS	but not doing it is faster
 Saurabh7	so the shallow copy method , I add ti to densefeatures ?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ^
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: no to CFeatures
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: and then overload in CDenseFetaures
@HeikoS	this also has to work with other features
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	will need to make that work for string features as well later
 Saurabh7	and what about labels
@HeikoS	when we touch x-validation again to also share the data
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: same story for labels, yes
@HeikoS	have a look, they have the same subset stack things inside
 Saurabh7	yep ok
 Saurabh7	alright looks clear this one :)

 HeikoS_web	i cant check right now
 HeikoS_web	can you push the json change back to my feature branch_
 HeikoS_web	feature/meta_
 HeikoS_web	something
 HeikoS_web	the travis there is currently broken, but we can see what happens if this is added back
 HeikoS_web	also feel free to add vector instantiation support in the jsons of the language bindings that fail
 HeikoS_web	ruby
 HeikoS_web	e.g.
 HeikoS_web	gotta go
 HeikoS_web	see you later
 HeikoS_web	might change that tomorrow
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg:
 bazdmeg	ok will try a bit later
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg: I told sanuj to change a few things btw
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg: lots of the stuff in there didnt make sense
 HeikoS_web	kind of involved, but still
 bazdmeg	what stuff
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg: e.g. setters should only work for previously registered tags
 bazdmeg	why so?
 HeikoS_web	like i should not be able to set "training_data" of CDenseFeatures
 HeikoS_web	because I should only be able to write to things that were member variables before
 bazdmeg	uhmm ok that's the next step
 HeikoS_web	why next step? can do that now
 HeikoS_web	can unit test with mock classes
 HeikoS_web	easy
 HeikoS_web	there has to be a public setter that checks and a private setter to that replaces SG_ADD
 HeikoS_web	the other things were
 HeikoS_web	why does the == operator compare the strings? no need
 HeikoS_web	just hash
 HeikoS_web	third was, why does set return things?
 HeikoS_web	in this weird way
 HeikoS_web	that if something was there, it is returned
 HeikoS_web	otherwise argument
 bazdmeg	well it should be returning Maybe
 bazdmeg	Maybe<T>
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 HeikoS_web	why?
 HeikoS_web	just use has
 HeikoS_web	before set call
 HeikoS_web	and then use get if want to save it
 bazdmeg	well maybe
 HeikoS_web	there also is question:
 HeikoS_web	do we merge this to develop?
 HeikoS_web	and then hack the SG_ADD?
 bazdmeg	if we start using it like with SG_ADD
 bazdmeg	then to develop
 HeikoS_web	and another one is: we dont need member variables anymore right?
 bazdmeg	yes
 HeikoS_web	so should this be re-factored?
 bazdmeg	at some point
 HeikoS_web	impossible
 bazdmeg	yes
 HeikoS_web	haha
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_web: with some magic in SG_ADD
 HeikoS_web	and all member variable soccurences are replaced with the get call
 bazdmeg	we can make them point to the same place
 HeikoS_web	yeah but definition I mean
 bazdmeg	so get_something
 bazdmeg	and get("something")
 bazdmeg	is the same
 HeikoS_web	yeah sure, just ::set(m_member, "bla"(
 HeikoS_web	but in fact
 HeikoS_web	we dont even need to declare the member anymore, am I right?
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_web: we have to
 HeikoS_web	it can just live in the map, being put there in constructor with SG_ADD
 bazdmeg	like in SG_ADD
 bazdmeg	yes
 bazdmeg	just in sg_add
 HeikoS_web	but I can also do
 HeikoS_web	::set(SGVEctor<...>, "member"(
 HeikoS_web	sorry
 HeikoS_web	::set(SGVector<T>(), "member"(
 HeikoS_web	no?
 HeikoS_web	and then the thing just lives in the map
 HeikoS_web	no more declaration
 bazdmeg	yes
 HeikoS_web	kinda weird
 bazdmeg	why
 HeikoS_web	no member variable declared
 HeikoS_web	all members added at runtime
 HeikoS_web	but its cool
 bazdmeg	so?
 bazdmeg	why weird
 bazdmeg	python
 bazdmeg	:D
 bazdmeg	is python weird?
 HeikoS_web	yep
 HeikoS_web	thats exactly it
 HeikoS_web	anyway,this refactor is insane anyways
 HeikoS_web	so first step, we just register the member
 bazdmeg	absolutely
 HeikoS_web	using SG_add change
 bazdmeg	we don't finish it tihs year
 HeikoS_web	so I want to merge this stuff soon
 bazdmeg	:D
 HeikoS_web	I mean the current patch
 bazdmeg	ok I think I need to do some SG_ADD hackery
 HeikoS_web	question: to develop?
 bazdmeg	it would be really tricky
 HeikoS_web	or not
 bazdmeg	*with* SG_ADD
 HeikoS_web	it is not too bad
 bazdmeg	it can go to develop
 HeikoS_web	as SG_ADD already takes name
 HeikoS_web	and reference
 bazdmeg	yes
 HeikoS_web	the old one m_parameter->add, is harder
 bazdmeg	it should go to develop but *with* SG_ADD
 HeikoS_web	yeah
 HeikoS_web	so we merge this to feature branch first
 HeikoS_web	then polish a bit
 HeikoS_web	then add SG_ADD
 HeikoS_web	and then merge
 HeikoS_web	to develop
 HeikoS_web	while developing SWIg stuff in parallel
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg: see my comments on the PR
 HeikoS_web	after that, I am fine to merge
 HeikoS_web	bazdmeg: Ill leave that to you
 bazdmeg	ok
 HeikoS_web	oh one thing is
 HeikoS_web	100% test coverage
 HeikoS_web	he didnt do that yet right?
 HeikoS_web	we will see
 HeikoS_web	gotta go home now
 HeikoS_web	see you
 bazdmeg	ok
 bazdmeg	yeah
