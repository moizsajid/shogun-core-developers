@sonney2k	iglesiasg, can you help with the website?
 shogun-buildbot	build #571 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it depends if I already know how to do it or I would have to learnt it, I am not sparing too much time these days
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what is it that needs to be done?
@iglesiasg	uhm all right... tell me about it anyway when you've got the time
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well tons of links are broken and descriptions are missing
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, that's something I can do for sure
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, for example http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/ourteam
@sonney2k	what's this crap
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I will poke around the links in the webpage to find broken links
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I know
@iglesiasg	we discussed about setting some pictures
@sonney2k	we need the picture from http://herrstrathmann.de/shogun-blog/108-shogun-workshop-2013.html
@iglesiasg	you read my mind :)
@iglesiasg	will do that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, then http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/resources
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so basically you would have to overhaul the thing going through all pages and subpages
@iglesiasg	last one broken, the others are good
@sonney2k	well this page kind of is ridiculous
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, aaah yes, a little bit
@sonney2k	all pages should have some description / text
@sonney2k	and then links explaining what these do
@sonney2k	I mean buildbot
@sonney2k	there should be a description in addition
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/contribute
@sonney2k	and this
@iglesiasg	is that crap too?
@sonney2k	I mean it makes sense to point people when they go to this page to the source code and the first steps etc
@sonney2k	yes
@iglesiasg	ok
@sonney2k	this page should rather be somewhere else
@sonney2k	it is more some kind of information
@iglesiasg	give me a few days to update the webpage as much as possible according to my criteria and then you can see if there is more to refine
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, thanks
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, will ping you about it on Monday again probably
@iglesiasg	I probably got time by Monday to fix things
@sonney2k	seems like everyone is busy currently so no chance to release soon I am afraid
@iglesiasg	it is not just a matter of time I am afraid
@iglesiasg	we should organize a bit better
@iglesiasg	but the organization also takes time in turn.. so yeah probably time mainly
@iglesiasg	I am off now
@iglesiasg	bye bye

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I was thinking that maybe we re-use our *.md (likeREADME.md) files and render these somewhere on the website too
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: exactly like I did for tapkee
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: there is .js that converts markdown to html on the fly
 lisitsyn	that's inexpensive for moden browsers
 lisitsyn	modern*
@iglesiasg	it sounds like a good idea
@iglesiasg	less stuff to keep up to date
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: we can do that server side
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: yeah why not
 sonne|work	iglesiasg, lisitsyn - question is how to merge this somehow with what we have in doc/
 sonne|work	I guess we should just have the README.md as entrance point and all the links then going to the proper places / files
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: somewhat like that yes

 van51	hello!
@iglesiasg	hi van51!
 van51	iglesiasg: how's it going? :)
@iglesiasg	van51, good good
@iglesiasg	van51, what about you?
 van51	iglesiasg: better now that I have a pc again :D
@iglesiasg	van51, oh, what happened?
@iglesiasg	holidays? computer broken? spiritual rest? :))
 van51	iglesiasg: computer broke
 van51	iglesiasg: thx to me
@iglesiasg	ouch
 van51	iglesiasg: I broke the plastic clips from the cpu fan, while cleaning it
@iglesiasg	I see, bad luck
 van51	iglesiasg: ye :/
@iglesiasg	van51, btw, I was checking
 van51	iglesiasg: at least the new one is a different design, so this won't happen again
 van51	iglesiasg: shoot
@iglesiasg	and there is a weird error in the buildbot
@iglesiasg	building the hasdoc doc features notebook
@iglesiasg	it seems that the notebook is created without trouble
@iglesiasg	but the in the ipynb to html conversion
 van51	but?
@iglesiasg	something happens
@iglesiasg	take a look if you have a moment
@iglesiasg	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/572/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
@iglesiasg	van51, I have no idea if it is due to something in the notebook or conf in the buildbot
 van51	iglesiasg: I will push in a while a new version
 van51	iglesiasg: let's see if it persists after that
@iglesiasg	van51, ok
@iglesiasg	van51, I think this is only built at night
@iglesiasg	so until tomorrow we won't know
@iglesiasg	mmm although maybe we can force re-build of nightly too
@iglesiasg	I guess it should be possible
@iglesiasg	van51,  will try once you have pushed :)
 van51	iglesiasg: ok, i will ping you when I have a PR
@iglesiasg	no hurries anyway
@iglesiasg	van51, that's great, thanks!
 sonne|work	van51:  if you have time to fix the notebook - please use the heading style for headings
 sonne|work	van51: I started with this but still a lot to do
 van51	sonne|work: heading style? you mean a separate cell or html headers?
 sonne|work	van51: yes
 van51	sonne|work: is there one ready the way you want it that I can use as reference?
@iglesiasg	van51, I think you can have a look to the template for that
@iglesiasg	and I guess the ICA and LMNN notebooks at least should be like sonne|work means
 van51	iglesiasg: ah I hadn't seen the template
 van51	iglesiasg: I'll look at those too
 van51	iglesiasg: thanks
 sonne|work	van51: it is new :)
 van51	I have to catch up I guess!
 sonne|work	van51: we need to follow this style such that we can automagically parse the abstract and image http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/notebook/
 sonne|work	van51: so I could generate this list ^
 van51	sonne|work: ok got it
 van51	sonne|work: btw are the demos up somewhere?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I think we have some problems with Matlab static
 sonne|work	van51: not yet
@iglesiasg	the guy in the mailing list and I am also with trouble to compile with Matlab static enabled
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I no longer have matlab
 sonne|work	so I cannot fix it
@iglesiasg	let's see if I get it to work in my machine

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Updated HashedDocDotFeatures notebook
 van51	sonney2k: do you have something else in mind?
@sonney2k	van51, we also need to make demo descriptions more verbose
@sonney2k	van51, currently it is pretty rough / no description what to do and why and what the parameters mean
 van51	sonney2k: for the web demos?
@sonney2k	van51, yes
 van51	sonney2k: ok I'll look at that now
@sonney2k	van51, apart from that I would say converting the examples in python_modular/graphical to notebooks would be a very good thing
@sonney2k	van51, I will do the svm notebook but the others I mean
 van51	sonney2k: hmm ok! I plan on staying up till late tonight so I'll probably take a go at those too as well
