 besser82	sonne|work: any objections for me to request an own decidated namespace on SuSE's OBS?
 besser82	sonne|work: for SHOGUN?
 besser82	sonne|work: Since I'm 85% finished on new CMake-stuff and have integrated src-package-generations for .deb and .srpm, we can use that for ci-builds / snapshot-packages for all recent published distros  ;)

 sonne|work	besser82: OBS?
 besser82	sonne|work: Open Build System
 sonne|work	besser82: why not :)
 besser82	sonne|work: GREAT!
 besser82	sonne|work: So we can offer own repos with snapshot-builds of shogun for CentOS/RHEL, (Open)SUSE, Debian, Fedora, Arch, *buntu, etc  ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: sounds awesome
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm glad you like my idea  :D
 besser82	sonne|work: requested  ;)  science:SHOGUN-namespace will be avail within tomorrow on OBS  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking, lisitsyn: https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/science:shogun  :D
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking, lisitsyn: you just need to signup with OBS so I can add your users to the project  ;)
@wiking	besser82: great! can u disable the report bug option? :)
 besser82	wiking: let me see....
@wiking	as it would be really confusing to have two different places to report and maintain bug reports
 lisitsyn	besser82: ohkay
 lisitsyn	besser82: didn't know you are somehow related to suse too :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  libyui && YaST  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  full push access to both github projects  ;)
 besser82	wiking, lisitsyn: are you signedup with OBS?
 lisitsyn	besser82: just did
 lisitsyn	besser82: login lisitsyn
@wiking	besser82: noup
 besser82	lisitsyn: did you click the link in confirmation-mail?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah I think so
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	novel.com
@wiking	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn: OBS tells me: "Couldn't find User with login = lisitsyn "...  Might take some time to populate into the db.....
@wiking	besser82: uid: vigsterkr
 besser82	wiking: like github?  ;)
@wiking	y
@wiking	but i think i have some problems as well with the email validation
@wiking	ok validated now

@wiking	the login doesn't realy work :S
 lisitsyn	el stupido de websitos
@wiking	yes
 lisitsyn	no iglesiasg to laugh at my pseudospanish haha
 lisitsyn	wiking: this website is pure 100% enterprise
 lisitsyn	SYSTEMS PRODUCTS TRAININGS
 lisitsyn	product oriented business modelling requesting global support solutions accountance service
 lisitsyn	administration terms of service locations customers profiles
 besser82	lisitsyn, wiking: can you sucessfully login to obs?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I think I have business logged in to the global accountance solution service based on client-oriented software
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	okay actually yes I am logged in
 besser82	lisitsyn: haha  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: still can't find your user;  let's w8 a bit
 lisitsyn	besser82: oh it is so enterprise you'd have to wait :D
 lisitsyn	this website is like oracle website
 besser82	lisitsyn: In fact, yes  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: looked over redhat website?
 lisitsyn	forms passwords required fields
 lisitsyn	no, is it more enterprise?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Definetively, YES!
 lisitsyn	so one can cry blood seeing it?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Have yourself a try  ;)

@wiking	nize
@wiking	novell solution
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	besser82: design wise it is quite ugly ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: though redhat logo is cool I really like it
 lisitsyn	but again, no idea what made them to put a dot in the end of the <b>red</b>hat
 lisitsyn	redhat.
 lisitsyn	why redhat.? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: If you are logged in you get spammed by enterprise stuff  ---->  buy this, get that, more trainings avail, get involved, start now, .....
 lisitsyn	besser82: ahhh yeah
 lisitsyn	take participance in our webinar on shit based oriented solutions

 besser82	wiking: By refactoring CMake && other stuff I actually have speed gains of ~600% with ccache  :-P
 besser82	wiking: without ccache and "serial" make there is a gain of ~80%
 besser82	wiking: compared to 8 parallel jobs with the current HEAD
 besser82	wiking: tomorrow I'm going to get that @$#!?& swig-stuff running && speed-up  ;)
@wiking	\o/
@wiking	awesome u r
 besser82	wiking: from yoda learn should you  ;)
@wiking	besser82: i'm happy to check on the diff
@wiking	even if it's not yet 100%
 besser82	wiking: need to check against bsd, cygwin and some other distro (like debian, *buntu), if works, I'll push  :D
 besser82	wiking: btw. diff is damn big
@wiking	besser82: pastebin it
@wiking	or gz and send it to wiking@maeth.com
 besser82	wiking: kk, will do

@wiking	thnx
 besser82	wiking: xz is ok for you, too?
 besser82	wiking: with gz it is still > 1Mbyte
@wiking	sure
@wiking	any arch format is good
 besser82	wiking: there is goes  :D
 besser82	s/is/it/#
@wiking	gotit
* sonne|osx just finished ballon dog production(tm) 
 sonne|osx	FYI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJQ42fvpaY
@wiking	what's with the changes in .h
@wiking	besser82: ^
@wiking	diff --git a/third_party/tapkee/utils/time.hpp b/third_party/tapkee/utils/time.hpp
 besser82	wiking: there shouldn't be much changes in headers....
@wiking	besser82: there's like complete rewrites according to diff :)
@wiking	of several header files
@wiking	most of the diff is about that actually
@wiking	no worries i guess we'll see it in the PR
 besser82	wiking: that's actually moving header to a seperate location
 besser82	wiking: git mv src/shogun/*/*.h include/shogun
 besser82	wiking: git is smart about that; diff is not
@wiking	besser82: so u totally moved out .h from src?
 besser82	wiking: yes
@wiking	mmm
 besser82	wiking: all, but lib/external
@wiking	i'm not sure people will be thrilled about that
 besser82	wiking: I actually discussed that with you, sonney2k, HeikoS and iglesiasg somewhen in Oct
 besser82	wiking: and all said `You can doooooooooooooo it`
@wiking	mmm iwasntthere
@wiking	:)
 besser82	wiking: and keeping the headers seperated from sources is one thing to gain speed boost during compiling
 besser82	wiking: like many more stuff, e.g. not globbing a kazillion cpp-sources to one target  ;)
 besser82	wiking: having a single target on each subdir gains another significant boost
 sonne|osx	besser82: but in the end you link stuff together or?
 besser82	wiking: in the end all objects get into one "big" libshogun.{a,so}
@wiking	besser82: yeah i get that
@wiking	besser82: but why's that different?
@wiking	besser82: but none the less, we were anyhow planning some sorts of slicing up the big libshogun
@wiking	so this is a good first step
 besser82	wiking: that's some of those magic "cmake-internals" you only get from those $$$ cmake-trainings
 besser82	wiking: offered by kitware
@wiking	i just dont get it why is it different if i say that i want from ALL cpps 1 libshogun, instead of small little ones
@wiking	ah so it's some cmake magic
@wiking	or like 'feature' of cmake
 besser82	wiking: something like that: cmake has some internal bookkeeping of which stuff already got compiled
 besser82	wiking: and that slows things a lot with too much files
@wiking	besser82: and why there's a speedup from headers move out to some other place?
 besser82	wiking: that's some of those gcc-magic-internals
@wiking	besser82: or that's again some cmake feature?
@wiking	besser82: why does it matter for gcc where it reads the .h from?
 besser82	wiking: because gcc does some checks for overlapping, when reading the .h from the same dir the .c is in
@wiking	eh
 besser82	wiking: yes, gcc is really pedantic about such
 besser82	wiking: there was a guy doing a benchmark on this....
 besser82	wiking: compiling some .c with gcc and including a thousand headers from the same dir
@wiking	besser82: is this some gcc stuff or true for clang as well?
 besser82	wiking: clang isn't affected
@wiking	besser82: then now we know why gcc was always so slower
 besser82	wiking: that's a gcc idiom
 besser82	wiking: yes
@wiking	as that was true on travis
@wiking	regardless of cmake or ./configure way
@wiking	gcc compilation was significantly slower
 besser82	wiking: the guy who did the benchmarks had some diff of ~400%
@wiking	well good that i dont use gcc :P
 besser82	wiking: use it's better that other compilers  ;)
@wiking	besser82: some tools are only available in 4.9
@wiking	:S
 besser82	wiking: just because 85% of upstream developers are on redhat's payroll  ;)
 besser82	wiking: which tools?
@wiking	besser82: undef behaviour
@wiking	i've read it somewhere that it'll be in 4.9
@wiking	but not before
@wiking	fsanitize=undefined
@wiking	that only works 4.9+
 besser82	wiking: Am I glad I'm using Fedora(tm)  ;-P
 besser82	wiking: F20 has 4.9.1 on board
 besser82	wiking: typo: it's 4.9.0 in RC
