@sonney2k	blackburn, look may 7 2012 seems to have been the most active at #shogun
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclogs/
@sonney2k	is that due to us enabling the bots maybe?
 blackburn	sonney2k: gott! we were talking all day long
@sonney2k	yeah crazy everyone was active that day
@sonney2k	blackburn, I just got a confirmation from Carol - our application got submitted
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am in MLdepression :(
 blackburn	we have to extend shogun somehow
 n4nd0	Bayesian learning!
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am too stupid to understand bayesian stuff
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	c'mon you are not
 n4nd0	but seriously, I think Bayesian stuff can be really cool
 blackburn	no idea
 n4nd0	although I must admit I have just seen a few fundamentals of it so far
 blackburn	I fucked up my brain with alexandrescu
 blackburn	can't see shogun code anymore
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	what do you want to do about it?
 blackburn	may be lay somewhere and cry, may be travel around siberia
 blackburn	not sure what can i do with it
 n4nd0	hehe
@sonney2k	blackburn, write some nice example!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have something concrete in mind
 blackburn	sonney2k: they are all useless :(
 blackburn	what is your idea?
@sonney2k	somthing that is live on the website basically
@sonney2k	so just some 2-class svm but writting in java script / python django
@sonney2k	+ utilizing shogun underneath
@sonney2k	and some fancy visualization via d3js
 blackburn	is it possible to call pythno from java script?
-!- n4nd0 [53b32c87@gateway/web/freenode/ip.83.179.44.135] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure on our website w/ dango
@sonney2k	django
@sonney2k	I think such kind of demos would make it much easier for people to grasp what shogun is about
@sonney2k	and we could have a toy demo for each class of shogun's algorithms
@sonney2k	blackburn, for other serious demos we really need concrete examples. I think the gender detector based on opencv would also be cool
@sonney2k	or some of wiking's live image segmentation
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is no machine learning in gender detection nor segmentation nor anything machine vision
 blackburn	I mean it is just learn a model and apply
 blackburn	sonney2k: in opencv they even include "w" vector for pedestrian detection
 blackburn	no machine learning anymore at all
 blackburn	sonney2k: are your kids better?
@sonney2k	blackburn, huh? What do you mean? The w vector needs to be learned so why is it not ML?
@sonney2k	sleeping now
 blackburn	sonney2k: one don't need a huge library to learn just w
 blackburn	and in the end nothing matters in ml sense, it is rather what you do with features
 blackburn	yeah I am in marvin state again
@sonney2k	so marvin tell me which field do you want to kill next?
@sonney2k	and actually sure you do - for the gender detection you need coffin or you won't be able to learn
 blackburn	sonney2k: liblinear doesn't use coffin
@sonney2k	blackburn, it does
 blackburn	in shogun?
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	but in liblinear?
@sonney2k	btw we totally didn't mention in NEWS that the gsoc's student's projects are in
@sonney2k	in liblinear nope - that is the problem
 blackburn	yeah we totally didn't mention 50% of things we should better
@sonney2k	blackburn, what else?
 blackburn	sonney2k: but it is not a problem for other people - that is the problem I am depressed with
 blackburn	sonney2k: SLEP fuckup at least
 blackburn	to remember :)
@sonney2k	we forgot heikos stuff too
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure it is - only very few people have 512G mem and hundreds of cores
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw about coffin
 blackburn	I think it could be implemented using generic programming
@sonney2k	and with shogun and that amount of mem they could have used orders of magnitude more examples and get much higher accuracy
 blackburn	dense and add are functors
 blackburn	didn't try but conceptually it could simplify code
@sonney2k	no idea about that
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think you should focus on submitting your edrt to jmlr
 blackburn	ha
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	I am working on it
 blackburn	just now
@sonney2k	you have too many things going on
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw n4nd0 will be in (I hope so)
@sonney2k	for what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: edrt
@sonney2k	what did he do?
 blackburn	sonney2k: nothing yet - he will help me with porting to eigen3 and new algorithms
@sonney2k	hmmhh, don't make it too big otherwise you will never finish
@sonney2k	I recall that reviewers were happy already last time
@sonney2k	blackburn, look at this http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/stack.html
@sonney2k	and then click group
 blackburn	whoop!
@sonney2k	isn't that cool
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	that is d3js :)
 blackburn	yeah it is
@sonney2k	blackburn, or http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html
@sonney2k	drag around some node
 blackburn	omfg
@sonney2k	so that is what I want for shogun demo
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is the mode you are in right https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibEdgQJEdTA&feature=related
 blackburn	om nom nom
 blackburn	sonney2k: exactly
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh well your edrt spin off - well do whatever you want
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I want to develop it standalone and then bind shogun to newest version
 blackburn	sonney2k: what did you mean?
@sonney2k	I know.
@sonney2k	exactly that
@sonney2k	I still dont' get why but hey do whatever you want
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you see any other way for that paper?
 blackburn	I can't demarkate where shogun ends
@sonney2k	sure. they didn't care about that
@sonney2k	all you have to do is explain just edrt's features and not so much shogun's
 blackburn	I think cheng meant that
@sonney2k	no cheng complained about that you described shogun's features
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is just like libqp
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand your gsoc summary
@sonney2k	" During the summer Sergey has ported a few algorithms from the SLEP and
@sonney2k	MALSAR libraries with further extensions and improvements.
@sonney2k	"
 blackburn	ehmm what is wrong
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	didn't you implement some multitask stuff your own?
 blackburn	sonney2k: from matlab code mostly
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you give me the links to slep/malsar please?
@sonney2k	blackburn, from chris or whom?
 blackburn	sonney2k: SLEP
 blackburn	and MALSAR
 blackburn	http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/
 blackburn	http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/MALSAR/
 blackburn	sonney2k: they have a lot of matlab code - I adopted their C code and developed C++ code using the matlab code
 blackburn	but with coffin and all the stuff
 blackburn	latest are using eigen3 as well with big impact on performance
@sonney2k	currently your summary doesn't sound impressive
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	though what you say here is cool so please tweak.
@sonney2k	name the algorithms you ported explicitly and what you did to them
 blackburn	well I didn't do anything special this summer
@sonney2k	I think that will make it sound better and gets closer to the truth
 blackburn	pretty bad work actually
@sonney2k	as usual
@sonney2k	marvin!!!
@sonney2k	blackburn, name them please
 blackburn	sonney2k: there will be too many algorithms named
@sonney2k	that is good
@sonney2k	and needed
@sonney2k	and please mention matlab -> c++ / coffin eigen3 too
 blackburn	Sergey Lisitsyn was our GSoC student for the second time and he focused on multitask learning. Multitask learning is a modern approach to machine learning that learns a problem together with other related problems at the same time using a shared representation. This approach often leads to a better model for the main task, because it allows the learner to use the commonality among the tasks. During the summer Sergey has developed efficient implementatio
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^ ?
 blackburn	I'd actually prefer 'He's spent some time on useless things nobody will ever touch'
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, your project description is currently worst of all :/
@sonney2k	and that is really is because of your stupid marvin mood
 blackburn	no idea what to do with it
@sonney2k	blackburn, *please give me the list of algoritms you ported*
@sonney2k	*now*
 blackburn	it is already in text I  sent
@sonney2k	when?
 blackburn	Namely, they are L12 group tree and L1q group multitask logistic regression and least squares regression, trace-norm multitask logistic regression, clustured multitask logistic regression, basic group and group tree lasso logistic regression.
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^?
@sonney2k	when did you sent that where?
 blackburn	ehmm
 blackburn	irc filtered it out probably

 blackburn	sonney2k: works this time?
@sonney2k	yes now I received it
@sonney2k	blackburn, but cut off
@sonney2k	what is following efficient I
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	2nd message?
@sonney2k	yes the "All the implemented..." is not complete
@sonney2k	sentence I mean
 blackburn	All the implemented algorithms use COFFIN framework for flexible and efficient learning and some of the algorithms were implemented using efficient Eigen3 library.
@sonney2k	that's it then right?
 blackburn	stupid irc
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	now it sounds much better
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is clustured multitask ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: tasks are clustered
@sonney2k	clustered?
 blackburn	automagically
@sonney2k	or structured
 blackburn	clustred
@sonney2k	k
 blackburn	sonney2k: you just say you have 81 tasks and 9 clusters
 blackburn	and it finds you the clusters
 blackburn	and solution as usual
 blackburn	relaxed k-means
 blackburn	stupid idiot thing no idea why ever use it
@sonney2k	yes marvin
 blackburn	desperation
* sonney2k hands blackburn a cookie
@sonney2k	cookie++
 blackburn	cookies are useless
 blackburn	my gf got bored and wrote a QNX problem, why on the earth one should write programs for QNX
 blackburn	program*
@sonney2k	blackburn, what other big changes did we have in shogun
@sonney2k	I recall SGVector etc + refcounting
@sonney2k	and utilizing eigen3
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm
 blackburn	let me recall
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am reading what we have achieved this summer and I cannot *not at all* see the slightest reason to be depressed
@sonney2k	to the contrary
@sonney2k	looks like a heroic effort
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah in number of lines probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: a few useless refactoring operations were carried out as well
 blackburn	we now have even more folders
@sonney2k	haha :D
 blackburn	okay time to sleep
 blackburn	sonney2k: have a nice weekend and good night
@sonney2k	blackburn, sweet as in sugar dreams!

 wiking	blackburn: ping
 blackburn	pong
 wiking	ok so i've did like almost everything
 wiking	but still cannot get python to be debugged
 wiking	i get a segfault if i start using Director class
 wiking	that's all i know :)
 blackburn	did you try that gdb attach or anything like thaT?
 blackburn	wiking: did you try valgrind?
 wiking	i cannot attach
 wiking	since it's very fast
 blackburn	it works for such debugging as well
 wiking	valgrind mmm
 wiking	ok
 wiking	let's see
 blackburn	valgrind catches segfaults as well
 wiking	trying :)
 wiking	didn't work :)
 blackburn	??
 wiking	only get segfault

 blackburn	wiking: see the problem?
 wiking	where?
 blackburn	we call get_name of object that was deleted
 wiking	sorry i'm trying to put together an osx buildbot
 wiking	ok but why it get's deleted i really wonder
 wiking	and why it's not happening
 wiking	when i don't use the director class?
 blackburn	wiking: we have to put some flag or call some function or so
 blackburn	I recall that
 blackburn	but what to call/set I do not recall
 blackburn	trying to find
 blackburn	!!!!!!!!!
 blackburn	wiking: call data.__disown__ after creation
 wiking	ok
 wiking	where? :)
 blackburn	wiking: so you create MotifData
 blackburn	somewhere in code
 blackburn	and after instantiation
 blackburn	call __disown__() method
 wiking	ok
 wiking	tyring
 wiking	ok cool
 wiking	now it's not crashing
 wiking	:DD
 wiking	wtf?
 blackburn	wiking: some reference counting issue..
 wiking	asdf
 wiking	:>
 wiking	ok but i have the same shiftfuck now
 blackburn	??
 wiking	that i get back a CData from features.get_sample(i)
 wiking	but i would need DNA or MotifPos
 blackburn	wiking: oh you finally found what is obtain_from_generic for
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	and it seems there's no way around this
 wiking	yeah but what if i specify a class
 wiking	in python
 wiking	or in this case this is not possible
 wiking	and i should just not even try it :D
 wiking	because if this is the case
 wiking	the whole concept of having latent svm in python is fucekd :)
 blackburn	no, why?
 wiking	so here's the deal
 wiking	i need to define 3 things for a latent svm
 wiking	latent model
 blackburn	you get Data but you need a DNA?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	i need DNA
 wiking	since it has some fields that i need in LatentModel
 wiking	but obviously Data doesn't have it
 blackburn	in similar fashion it would be DNA.obtain_from_generic(m_features.get_sample(idx))
 blackburn	don't you like it?
 wiking	blackburn: but how do i do the typecasting in python/ :)
 wiking	i mean i'll have to write the c++ for DNA class then
 blackburn	ah
 wiking	i mean i'll have to define DNA class and implement in c++
 blackburn	right
 wiking	that's what you are saying now
 blackburn	fucking python
 wiking	hehe hyeah
 wiking	exactly
 wiking	:))
 blackburn	why not to have casting?
 blackburn	they denied it allthrough
 blackburn	wiking: so what to do with it..
 wiking	well
 wiking	i guess there's no way this will work then
 gsomix	wiking: here
 wiking	gsomix: hehehe we've just realised that it's not going to work out with blackburn
 wiking	ok so i have to reimplement now this in c P)

 wiking	but couldn't mount the img
 wiking	had some problems... couldn't find hfsplus superblock
@sonney2k	wiking, well worst case burn the dmg to a dvd and then copy / create an iso from it
 wiking	sonney2k: heheh no bw for upping now an iso from my place
 shogun-buildbot	build #597 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/597
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-176-2-92.range86-176.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	heiko, around?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes! hi
@sonney2k	heiko, I'd like to have your blog on shogun planet
@sonney2k	not the gsoc blog
 heiko	the shogun one?
 heiko	sure go ahead!
@sonney2k	your last entry didn't appear on planet
 heiko	yes, I started a new one
 heiko	shogun related
 wiking	blackburn: where's asm? :D
 heiko	sonney2k, where I want to write stuff I do for shogun
@sonney2k	heiko, well what is the url for all?
 blackburn	wiking: it looked similar and I gave up :D
 heiko	Ehm, I dont have one I think, let me construct one
 blackburn	with -O3 it is nearly the same
 heiko	Ill send it to you
@sonney2k	well shogun planet doesn't necessarily mean only shogun stuff
@sonney2k	anything authors (or related people) write is totally fine
@sonney2k	can be about weather or whatever
 heiko	sonney2k, ok
@sonney2k	but missing your last blog post on planet is stupid
 heiko	sonney2k, indeed
 heiko	sonney2k, can you just add the other blog url feed?
 heiko	sonney2k, since I am pretty lame in webprogramming and dont know how to create a feed of the featured articles from the main site (using joomla)
 heiko	sonney2k, this is the url
 heiko	http://herrstrathmann.de/shogun-blog
 heiko	the feed is on the bottom
 heiko	http://herrstrathmann.de/shogun-blog.feed?type=rss
 blackburn	matrix experts anyone?
@sonney2k	heiko, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun
@sonney2k	much better
@sonney2k	heiko, how do you get the tex stuff translated into formulas?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes its annoying that the graphics dont appear
 heiko	its a joomla plugin
 blackburn	Y' * (W^-1) * Y
 heiko	I think they are loaded from an external page
 heiko	by the plugin
 blackburn	can somebody translate that into equation to avoid inverse?
@sonney2k	heiko, too bad that this is not preserved in the feed
 heiko	sonney2k, indeed, Ill check for a solution to generate graphics instead
 heiko	sonney2k, http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/living/education-a-culture/tex/12357
@sonney2k	heiko, there is this http://www.mathjax.org/
@sonney2k	heiko, you basically just write latex code and it is translated via javascript
 wiking	yooohoooo
 wiking	ocas_time 3082.422861 s
 wiking	let's see how it is :>
 heiko	sonney2k, ok I will take a look
@sonney2k	heiko, let me just add it to the website
 heiko	sonney2k, how to do that?
 heiko	I actually have no idea about this stuff ;)
@sonney2k	heiko, well the mathjax doc says just to include a .js script
@sonney2k	that's all
 wiking	shouldwork
@sonney2k	so then as soon as you write latex math code it will be translated
 wiking	chrome doesnotlike mathml
@sonney2k	heiko, and this would work on your joomla etc too
 wiking	blackburn: ping
 blackburn	wiking: pong
 wiking	blackburn: whatyaneed?
 blackburn	wiking: B = Y' inv(W) Y
 blackburn	want to have W without inv
 blackburn	costs too much for me
 wiking	blackburn: btw check out this one http://maeth.com/pres.test
 wiking	blackburn: press 'f' for fullscreen
 wiking	blackburn: and of course you can do all the fancy css3 transformations ;)
 blackburn	wiking: your work?
 wiking	blackburn: noup of course not :)
 wiking	blackburn: just put together 2 jquery plugins
 wiking	:)
 wiking	blackburn: http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	blackburn: wekk i guess u r looking for B
 wiking	or?
 blackburn	wiking: yes I need to translate it to WB = ..
 blackburn	hmm may be it is possible in two steps?
 wiking	 /*W
 blackburn	wiking: what does that mean?
@sonney2k	wiking, I've seen someone use that + d3js and mathjax
@sonney2k	very fancy talk that you can afterwards easily put on the web
 wiking	sonney2k: yep
@sonney2k	heiko, that is how you can use it in joomla http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/platforms/index.html
 wiking	blackburn: does Y have any special property?
 blackburn	wiking: orthogonal
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	wait wait so
 blackburn	B = Y' inv(W) Y
 blackburn	Y B = inv(W) Y
 blackburn	wiking: looks correct for you?
 wiking	how?
 wiking	no
 wiking	y' = transpose of y or?
 blackburn	left multiply by Y?
 blackburn	Y' is transpose
 blackburn	Y B = Y Y' inv(W) Y
 blackburn	can we do that?
 blackburn	I haven't been working with matrices for a while :D lol
 wiking	well
 wiking	matrix mult is does not commute
 blackburn	yes it is not
 heiko	sonney2k, I now changed the latex to cache the images locally, so it should be fine, how can I tell shogun planet to update itself?
 wiking	unless they are diagonal and are the same dim
 blackburn	you mean it will be
 blackburn	Y B = Y (Y' inv(W) Y)
 blackburn	yes?
 wiking	BY' = Y' inv(w) Y Y'
 wiking	yeah it's almost the same :)
 wiking	shouldwork
 blackburn	okay BY' = Y' inv(W)
 blackburn	but it is not a linear equation system yet
@sonney2k	heiko, well even better just use mathjax
 blackburn	wiking: do you remember whether we can transpose both left and right side?
 heiko	sonney2k, then I have to install it, I really would like to avoid that if it works otherwise
@sonney2k	heiko, look I just did this http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun
 blackburn	we can
 heiko	sonney2k, how worked that?
@sonney2k	heiko, no only write this one line in your doc
 heiko	but dont I have to install the software before?
@sonney2k	then you can immediately have latex code in there
 wiking	blackburn: but A*A' != I
 heiko	really, just this one liner?
 heiko	cool thing
@sonney2k	heiko, no just followhttp://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/platforms/index.html
 heiko	sorry I got that wrong
@sonney2k	http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/platforms/index.html
 blackburn	wiking: what is A?
 wiking	blackburn: any matrix
@sonney2k	looks cool right
 blackburn	wiking: A*A' = I for an orthonormal matrix
@sonney2k	heiko, for that to work I replaced {tex} with \[ and {/tex} with \] on all pages ...
 wiking	ah yeah u said that it's orthonormal
@sonney2k	when n4nd0 is around I will tell him too
 heiko	sonney2k, I think n4nd0 is on wordpress where things work automatically
 blackburn	wiking: hmm when we have BY' = Y' inv(W), we transpose both parts YB' = inv(W)' Y
@sonney2k	heiko, well look at how awful it looks on his blog
@sonney2k	so he should convert to using mathjax too
 wiking	well then altogether u have YBY' = inv(w)
 wiking	:P
 wiking	or?
 wiking	:>
 heiko	sonney2k, youre right, this mathjax is an awesome tool
 wiking	mathjax is a shitty replacement of mathml
 wiking	imho
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: inv(W)' Y can be easily computed
 blackburn	denote it by K then we have YB' = K
@sonney2k	heiko, now imagine this used with http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored
 wiking	it's just helping chrome and other shitty browsers who doesn't support mathml
@sonney2k	impress js
@sonney2k	heiko, to give talks
 wiking	sonney2k: jmpress.js is better
 wiking	sonney2k: imho
 wiking	sonney2k: as it's jquery based so u really can do some fancy shit
 wiking	i've started with impress.js
 wiking	but for some reason bartaz doesn't want jquery in it
 wiking	:(
 wiking	so that's why there's jmpress.js
 heiko	sonney2k, that one is pretty cool!
 blackburn	sonney2k: impressive, it is a next step after beamer ones
 blackburn	so evolution is god damn shit powerpoint -> beamer -> js :D
 blackburn	wiking: thanks I think it should work
 wiking	heiko: http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/docs/#docs-examples
 blackburn	wiking: I am trying to leverage redsvd for my dirty purposes
@sonney2k	heiko, then combine this with d3js for figures http://d3js.org/
@sonney2k	heiko, e.g. http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html
@sonney2k	heiko, or http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/stack.html
 wiking	battlestation down :(
 wiking	sonney2k: !!!
 wiking	sonney2k: irc hook for github
 wiking	sonney2k: can u fire it up plz?
@sonney2k	wiking, cia is dead
 wiking	sonney2k: but it's not based on cia
 wiking	or?
@sonney2k	and I tried to configure the standard irc hook for github but it doesn't work
@sonney2k	wiking, no idea how to get it to work
 wiking	sonney2k: r u sure u used shogun-toolbox account and not yours?
 wiking	like in case of travis
@sonney2k	wiking, sure
@sonney2k	wiking, try to add notifications to your local fork
 wiking	ok
@sonney2k	if it works we get this to work
 wiking	sonney2k:
 wiking	notice - Enables notice support. Make sure you configure channel to support notices ("/mode #yourchannelname -n" or "/msg chanserv set mlock -n")
 wiking	could u plz?
@sonney2k	wiking, long done
 wiking	Configure your IRC channel to allow external messages (/mode #yourchannelname -n).
 wiking	?
@sonney2k	wiking, that is the same thing
@sonney2k	only chanserv is doing this kind of stuff on freenode

 wiking	cool
 wiking	;)
@sonney2k	wiking, no it is not my account because email notifications, cia, travis etc stuff is in there
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	try it then with that
 wiking	as u see it works
 wiking	let me turn it off
 blackburn	wiking: where to set it up?
 wiking	blackburn: admin -> service hooks -> IRC
 blackburn	found thanks
 wiking	sonney2k: and then just push the test hook
 wiking	it takes a about 10-20 seconds
 blackburn	lets try
 wiking	to get on irc
 blackburn	wiking: how do you call it to announce again?
 wiking	blackburn: test hook
 wiking	after you've updated the settings
 wiking	you'll have a test hook button

 wiking	baaartendeeer!
 wiking	travis already knows the drill :P
 wiking	he always serves another round on blackburn's tap :D
@sonney2k	wiking, alright it works now. the reason why it did not work was that the length of the nick has strict limitations
 wiking	sonney2k: hehehe u gave like a 1024 chars long nick?:)
 heiko	ah got it
@sonney2k	wiking, nope around 10
 wiking	sonney2k: :>
 wiking	none the less
 wiking	thanx a lot
 blackburn	sonney2k: was it DieShogunAlarmgeber?
 wiking	blackburn: :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course sth like that - you know german have these long words like eierlegendewollmilchsau
 blackburn	sonney2k: the password you gave me @shogun-toolbox.org was like that as well
 wiking	sonney2k: this d3 is pretty crazy
@sonney2k	blackburn, like HosenRunterUnterHosen :D
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah I love it. We need to craft all demos utilizing d3js - so we can have them live on the website
 wiking	sonney2k: i suppose u can feed it with json data or?
@sonney2k	wiking, csv or cmdline or table or ...
@sonney2k	cmdline == as arguments
 wiking	sweet
@sonney2k	seems like one can do anything with it
 wiking	we can generate json right?
@sonney2k	we are python
 wiking	never tried it but i know that shogun depends on libjson :)
 wiking	sonney2k: no i'm not  :(
 wiking	sonney2k: fuckshit class inheritance doesn't let me python
@sonney2k	wiking, what are you trying to do?
 wiking	well as said earlier
 wiking	if i want to be able to do latent svm fully from python
@sonney2k	but?
 wiking	i would need to be able to define my custom classes (derived from CData)
-EDRTbot:#shogun- [edrt] lisitsyn pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/lisitsyn/edrt/commit/92c4ea0db10d1cbf7a323cd007f036ecf272aa52
-EDRTbot:#shogun- edrt/master 92c4ea0 Sergey Lisitsyn: Added REDSVD-like eigensolver routine (not tested yet)
 wiking	and then i set these in my custom LatentModel (defined in python as well)
 wiking	this works fine
 wiking	but then
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please stop the edrtbot logging?
 blackburn	I will kill myself if it works faster than arpack
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	blackburn: :DDD
 blackburn	sonney2k: why? I can
 wiking	sonney2k: so but then when i try to get back the CData in LatentModel
 wiking	i only get CData*
 wiking	i cannot get back the class that i've defined in python
 wiking	and there's no way i can 'cast' it to the right format
 wiking	or at least i couldn't find a way
@sonney2k	blackburn, because of too much noise on the channel
 wiking	(latentmodel stores CData* in a DynamicArray)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hardly commit once per day :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, this IRC thing is even more verbose than cia - not too nice :/
