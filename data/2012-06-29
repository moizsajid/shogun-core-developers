 heiko	sonney2k, how can I activate debug messages from python?
 blackburn	any object.io.set_loglevel(1)
 heiko	thanks blackburn
 heiko	blackburn, are you still there?
 heiko	I have a weird thing
 blackburn	sure
 heiko	I have a feature object
 heiko	say CFeatures* p
 heiko	and I call p->get_num_vectors()
 heiko	why is that possible?
 heiko	the method is pure
 heiko	but it works
 blackburn	but what is the actual type?
 heiko	DenseFeatures
 heiko	the method is overwritten there
 blackburn	so what is the problem?
 heiko	but why can I call it from the CFeatures interface?
 heiko	I thought that wasnt possible
 blackburn	because it is virtual
 heiko	but its abstract
 heiko	I thought the compiler forbids that, in fact I have experienced that a few times
 heiko	and the linker complaining about undefined references
 blackburn	hmm strange I've never experienced problem with pure virtual methods
 heiko	mmh perhaps I have kept that wrong in memory
 blackburn	it looks fine to me - you just declare it in base class and put impl in derived ones
 heiko	I mean in C++ you always have that problem that a class cannot call its own pure virtual methods
 blackburn	CSGObject::get_name is pure virtual as well
 heiko	yes true
 heiko	mmg
 heiko	seems like, I have to read about that :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, can you please have a look why all sparse features examples in static interfaces crash: http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/9/steps/test/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	heiko, blackburn that would be the 'new' buildbot http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	only debian 1-3 now
@sonney2k	and nightly build
@sonney2k	s
 heiko	sonney2k, nice!
 heiko	much more accessible :)
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/ is now the latest *released* documentation
@sonney2k	and nightly we get an updated doc
@sonney2k	created at
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/
 heiko	ah thats also good
@sonney2k	it is run in the nightly_default process
@sonney2k	heiko, so now we only need a few more machines for osx, cygwin
 heiko	yeh
@sonney2k	and potentially other linuxes
 heiko	any ideas on the osx thing so far?
 heiko	and cygwin?
@sonney2k	heiko, btw I am pretty impressed by the size of the build directory 1261504 kB for the whole build!
 heiko	hehe wow,
 heiko	but that probably are the modular interfaces right?
 heiko	how big is libshogun?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok will take a look
@sonney2k	heiko, well look at the buildbot :D
@sonney2k	heiko, I already have a cygwin machine
@sonney2k	tough to setup though but working on it
 heiko	cool
@sonney2k	for osx  I have absolutely no idea yet :`-(
 heiko	:(
@sonney2k	so plan for now is to get cygwin running
@sonney2k	and email notifications
 heiko	yeah step by step
@sonney2k	I always got email notifications btw
@sonney2k	so maybe I should at least put you: heiko, blackburn on the always recipient list for failures...

@sonney2k	for both of you your google addresses?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, any news on your PR?
@sonney2k	didn't you want to send it by yesterday night?
@sonney2k	blackburn, all sparse stuff fails in modular too http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/12/steps/test/logs/stdio
 heiko	sonney2k, I would like to add a little scripts to the python_modular/tools folder
 heiko	but it is ignored by git
 heiko	should I add with -f?
@sonney2k	heiko, is it in .gitignores?
 heiko	yes
@sonney2k	heiko, what is its name?
 heiko	Id like to git add ../examples/undocumented/python_modular/tools/two_distributions_data.py
 heiko	but
 heiko	examples/undocumented/python_modular/tools is in gitignore
@sonney2k	heiko, well it should not
@sonney2k	so better fix git ignore
 heiko	kk
@sonney2k	alright 30 C here
@sonney2k	I better go swimming before the thunderstorm comes

 puffin444	Heiko, I have a question about the linear kernel
 heiko	pufin444, yes, hi
 puffin444	It does not appear that there are any registered parameters for the LinearKernel. Is my observation correct?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	the two should be registered
 heiko	this is often forgotten :)
 puffin444	Normal and normal_length?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn1	too bad C++ have no annotations
 puffin444	Do you think it makes sense to make them model selection parameters? I am not sure how a vector could  be modified in the framework.
 puffin444	Or at least the normal vector
 heiko	no I think they shouldnt be available
 heiko	As far as I understand it they are only used in the optimisation case and set from outside anyway
 blackburn1	agree
 puffin444	Okay. So I don't think I can add any kernel derivatives for the linear kernel then.
 heiko	but thats natural isnt it?
 heiko	for a linear kernel, what can you do? :)
 heiko	they is nothing to vary
 puffin444	I think so. GPML has a linear kernel with ARD that has kernel derivatives available
 heiko	linear kernel with ARD?
 heiko	how does that work?
 heiko	for ARD you would need some kind of parameter for every dimension
 heiko	do you have a link?
 heiko	so I can read that?
 heiko	what are their kernel parameters?
 puffin444	Yes its under covLINard.m at http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/release/gpml-matlab-v3.1-2010-09-27.zip
 puffin444	a parameter for each dimension as you said.
 blackburn1	two kernel statisticians walk into a bar
 heiko	puffin44, I see, they bsically add a factor to each dimension
 heiko	you could add that to our linear kernel
 heiko	the kernel is then k(x,y)= x1*y1*alpha1+x2*y2*alpha2 ....
 heiko	blackburn and then? :)
 heiko	puffin444, I like the idea
 puffin444	How would this fit into the model selection framework? Wouldn't the dimensionality have to be set at construction?
 puffin444	If the dimension of the inputs change then somehow the modelselection parameters would have to be deleted and created over again.
 blackburn1	heiko: and then your conversation :)
 heiko	but why should the dimension change when you use a linear kernel?
 heiko	or do you mean when you register one parameter per dimension?
 puffin444	I'm not sure. Suppose you allocated a linear kernel for some data set, use it, call cleanup(), and then init() if for some other dataset with different dimensions.
 puffin444	one parameter per dimension if I want to integrate it into hyperparameter learning.
 heiko	ah, ok, I would say, just register a vector with the weights per dimension
 heiko	then the parameter (also for modelselection) is *one* vector
 heiko	would that be a problem in the lerning methods you wrote?
 puffin444	This might complicate the kernel derivatives, as right now they are accessed by name.
 heiko	you would have to treat all elements of the vector as single parameter
 heiko	cant you just access the whole vector and then take only the desired index?
 heiko	mmh the derivative of a linear kernel which is linear in its parameters
 heiko	wait, what would be the derivative of this kernel?
 puffin444	The derivative would be respect to each dimension.
 puffin444	K = -2*x(:,i)*x(:,i)';
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	I mean, the parameter vanishes
 puffin444	The issue is that in order to abstractly access kernel parameters, I current take the total number of registered model selection parameters and use their name to get their derivative.
 shogun-buildbot	Hey! build nightly_default #5 is complete: Failure [failed test]
 shogun-buildbot	Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/5
 puffin444	Thanks buildbot
 blackburn1	shogun-buildbot: Hey!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
 heiko	damn that was my fault :)
 puffin444	I am not sure how the indices of a vector parameter would fit it.
 puffin444	The buildbot seems cheerful considering the build failed.
 heiko	puffin444, mmh, hard to tell for me currently
 heiko	I mean if you can access the vector itself
 heiko	and you can get the derivative with respect to all these parameters, then you would be fine right?
 heiko	the way they do it in the GP box is the same, they just compute the derivative wrt all dimensions
 blackburn	ping
 blackburn1	pong
 blackburn1	lol
 heiko	blackburn wtf ? :)
 heiko	have you split?
 blackburn1	heiko: transferring data from old notebook to new
 blackburn1	so work on both now
 heiko	make backups
 heiko	I recently deleted all my data :)
 heiko	when doing exactly that
 blackburn1	that should be funny
 puffin444	One possible, but perhaps awkward way to do it is have the derivative function in the kernel return a list of matrices instead of one.
 puffin444	Wait forget it that would mess up the GradientSelection stuff.
 blackburn1	oh I like having 8 gb of ram
 blackburn	bastard
 heiko	puffin444, no too much memory
 puffin444	The problem is currently the framework treats each registered parameter as one dimension to be optimized. Access is by name to bypass possibly different indicies used for the same parameters in different data structures.
 heiko	yes I see

 heiko	but puffin444, when the kernel matrix is derived wrt to say first dimension parameter
 puffin444	Yes
 heiko	what is the difference when you derive wrt to second?
 heiko	no, this doesnt lead somewhere :(
 heiko	how hard would it be to extend the framework to also work on vectors?
 heiko	(and matrices) of parameters
 puffin444	I really don't know.
 heiko	this problem arises with any ard right?

-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@31.28.43.76] has left #shogun []
 puffin444	Yes, and now that I look at Combined Kernel we have the same problem I think with computing derivatives.
 puffin444	With the vector of subkernel weights
 heiko	yes I see
 heiko	mmh, we have to think about it some more
 heiko	I would currently say to extend the proceure
 heiko	you currently get parameters by name, but since you can access the TParameter construct you also got type information
 heiko	and using that you can make a distinction between CT_SCALAR, CT_VECTOR etc
 puffin444	Okay.
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@31.28.43.76] has joined #shogun
 heiko	and then iterator over all indices
 heiko	then whats missing is how to get the derivative from the kernel
 heiko	since we only know the index we are currently at
 heiko	this could be solved by simply passing the index as parameter
 heiko	but then theres the problem of having a unified interface for derivatives in general
 puffin444	Yeah, I could overload the function by adding one that takes both a name and index.
 heiko	yes that would work for vectors
 heiko	could also do it for matrices
 puffin444	I call one of them based on the TParameter Type.
 heiko	and since these are the only container types shogun got
 heiko	there are only three possibilites
 blackburn	heiko: statistics_quadratic_time_mmd
 heiko	blackburn, already fixed
 blackburn	ah forgot to pull sorry
 heiko	puffin444, I think that would be nice
 blackburn	heiko: statistics_linear_time_mmd
 heiko	blackburn, damn :)
 puffin444	Another issue is within the Sum and Combined Kernels. Suppose a Combined Kernel has a Gaussian Subkernel that has a width parameter.
 puffin444	Forget it. If I pass the name to the subkernels it shouldn't be an issue.

 heiko	puffin444, ok
 heiko	puffin444, well this addition by vectors and matrices would make the framework even nicer :)
 heiko	and the problem with the number of dimensions (dont know how many parameters to register) is resolved on the fly
 puffin444	This will take more time than expected though.
 heiko	shogun-buildbot faster!
 heiko	puffin444, yes, these framework things always take ages. I still remember the horror of these parameter trees last year :)

 heiko	I just added the example
 heiko	blackburn I have an idea
 heiko	we could add a method to shogun class
 heiko	boolean have_lapack()
 heiko	which then returns true/false depending on #ifdef stuff
 blackburn	well you may handle this via import
 heiko	that would work
 heiko	then in python you can ask that
 blackburn	if import fails you have no your stuff available
 heiko	but still the example fails
 blackburn	no, why
 heiko	oh can one check for failing imports in pythong?
 heiko	python?
 blackburn	just catch exception and do nothing
 blackburn	yeah try except
 heiko	mmmh
 heiko	but in my case only one method is defined or not
 heiko	import would work
 blackburn	heiko: you can check if method is here

 heiko	nice I will add that
 CIA-18	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * r42dd334 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/statistics_quadratic_time_mmd.py : added check for method availability to avoid errors when lapack isnt installed - http://git.io/WAIA1g

 heiko	blackburn, nice works
 heiko	I will leave now, see you later
 blackburn	heiko: see you

@sonney2k	wiking, could you please give me an update?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hey have 5 mins?
 blackburn	gsomix asked me about add_to_dense_sgvec
 blackburn	I am a little confused with it as well
@sonney2k	gsomix, why don't you ask me?
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay we both are little confused with SGVector parameter
 gsomix	sonney2k, blackburn is closer to me... :)
 blackburn	we copy memory here you know
 blackburn	how can it work at all?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand the question
 blackburn	sonney2k: add_to_sgvec has SGVector parameter
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	lol nevermind
@sonney2k	problem is you cannot do any operations with pointers
@sonney2k	so you need some sgvector interface
@sonney2k	gsomix, I see
 blackburn	I mixed up what is being added and where
 blackburn	gsomix: add_to_sgvec adds given vector (you map it from numpy)
@sonney2k	so the idea is that this sg vector based function has to be overloaded
 blackburn	to ith one
 blackburn	sonney2k: I got it - that's ok
@sonney2k	and the sg_vector based function will be called from the standard one
@sonney2k	k
 blackburn	for some reason I had idea that something modifies given vector
 blackburn	so there would be a problem
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw the other thing on the plan once all this is finished are the typemaps for python for easier model selection interface
 blackburn	sonney2k: I actually think we should stop at some point
 blackburn	not with >5 of director classes
 blackburn	once example is here it is easy to continue
 blackburn	so for example I'd rather let say n4nd0 do it by given example - he just knows his domain
 blackburn	it takes some time for gsomix to get into stuff he modifies
 blackburn	sonney2k: wait I was wrong
 blackburn	I am still confused
 blackburn	sonney2k: you input vec2 (SGVector)
 blackburn	and want to modify it
 blackburn	how can it go back if we typemap w/ copying
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
@sonney2k	blackburn, it will be copied, then modified from python and then the modified thing is copied again and goes back to the add_to_dense_vec
 blackburn	sonney2k: uhh how does it work?
@sonney2k	blackburn, as you would expect
 blackburn	does swig maps it back and forth?
@sonney2k	via the in / out typemaps
 blackburn	I thought out typemaps are only for return types
@sonney2k	one can even define new director in / out typemaps btw
@sonney2k	they are
@sonney2k	but you forget that this thing is going to python
@sonney2k	and somehow has to go back to C
@sonney2k	++
@sonney2k	so C -> python -> C
 blackburn	okay then I expect director dot features a little slow
@sonney2k	and arrows use the director stuff
@sonney2k	same with kernel computation btw
 gsomix	Hhmm, and what about vec2 (SGVector)? Actually it's not numpy array, just pointer. I think there is a little problem, because vec2 is <Swig Object of type 'shogun::SGVector< double > *' at 0x1d069d0>.
@sonney2k	we used some get_vector there - well only once
@sonney2k	gsomix, which function are you talking about?
 gsomix	add_to_dense_sgvec
@sonney2k	well it is a SGVector
@sonney2k	what you can do is use its operations
@sonney2k	like +=
@sonney2k	whatever
@sonney2k	like in the example
 gsomix	But I thought he should to be transformed into an array.
 gsomix	*numpy array
@sonney2k	hmmhh you are right
 gsomix	And this is numpy array. After +=, I mean.
@sonney2k	maybe it is not after all
@sonney2k	I wonder if this only happens when we use directorin / out typemaps
 gsomix	sonney2k, should I try use directorin/out in typemaps?
@sonney2k	gsomix, we don't need them for Dotfeatures it seems
@sonney2k	it is sufficient to have the += operator overloaded
@sonney2k	hmmhh strong thunderstorm outside...
 gsomix	I'm afraid of thunderstorms... last was with a hurricane
@sonney2k	nah not this one
@sonney2k	gsomix, you might need to overload *= etc operators to get other dot feature operations to work
 gsomix	sonney2k, All right. I need to think a little and sleep.
 gsomix	sonney2k, see you tomorrow, ok? =___=
 gsomix	good night

 n4nd0	hey alexlovesdata, how are you doing?
 alexlovesdata	hey nando
 alexlovesdata	preparing to try out somethin for medical data ... but in one hour
 alexlovesdata	currently yet busy ;)
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: can I ask you something about hmsvm? something about theory, nothing fancy I think
 alexlovesdata	ye, but maybe later
 n4nd0	all right
 alexlovesdata	I am still helping a friend with an insurance
