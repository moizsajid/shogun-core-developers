 sanuj	wiking, i have updated this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3357
@wiking	can you please explain more detail about
@wiking	what's TagRealVector and RealVector are like? and why not the same? :)
 sanuj	TagX contains a name and type information for the object X
 sanuj	so TagRealVector is an identifier for RealVector object
@wiking	still dont understand
@wiking	could you maybe explain it a bit differently?
 sanuj	wiking, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/tag.h#L42
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	let me try
 sanuj	you have an object of RealVector called r_vec
 sanuj	and you have another object called "obj"
 sanuj	obj has a member_variable named "numbers" which is of type RealVector
 sanuj	now there are two ways to set the value of member_variable named "numbers" in "obj"
 sanuj	obj.setsRealVector("numbers", r_vec)
@wiking	why not: obj.sets("numbers", r_vec)
@wiking	?
 sanuj	because sets<T> is a template function
 sanuj	so in swig you need to instantiate it with different types
@wiking	sets is not a sets(string, Any) ?
 sanuj	wiking,
 sanuj	template <typename T, typename U=void>
 sanuj	void sets(const std::string& name, const T& value)
@wiking	y
@wiking	?
 sanuj	wiking, well, how else can it be?
@wiking	sets could accept any type
@wiking	anyhow yes listeing
@wiking	so you have
@wiking	so you
@wiking	basically
@wiking	genereaate
 sanuj	you have name of parameter that you want to set, value of parameter and type of parameter as T
@wiking	sets[WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANNA SET](string, obj)
@wiking	for the swig interface?
@wiking	so if i want to set for an object
@wiking	my new KurvaMachine
@wiking	then i'll have
@wiking	a setsKurvaMachine("name of kurva machine instance", machine)
@wiking	?
@wiking	this is the swig interface/
@wiking	?
 sanuj	wiking, no, only those params can be set which are registered in the object by using register_param()
 sanuj	in the constructor
@wiking	yeye
@wiking	but say
@wiking	i have a
@wiking	in my object
@wiking	registere
@wiking	so say my new class is liek
@wiking	class X{ .... CKurvaMachine m_kurva_machine;};
@wiking	right?
@wiking	i mean this is the old way
@wiking	but just to give you an example
@wiking	so in this case
@wiking	k = X()
@wiking	k.setsKurvaMachine("name", kurva_obj)
@wiking	?
 sanuj	yeah
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i dont know if i wanna laugh or cry
@wiking	this is fucking madness
@wiking	...
@wiking	but ok
 sanuj	wiking, you can use sets() also
 sanuj	but you need to make TagKurvaMachine("name")
 sanuj	then
 sanuj	k.sets(tag_kurva_machine, kurva_obj)
@wiking	so then
@wiking	i'll have to have a new Tagged instance
@wiking	that's nothing else
@wiking	just a wrapper
@wiking	*ish thingy
@wiking	http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/no-words-homer-into-brush.gif
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	wiking, i had discussed this with lisitsyn and HeikoS both
@wiking	sanuj, ok
@wiking	all green
@wiking	let's merge it then
@wiking	in

 sanuj	wiking, ok so i tried k.sets("name", kurva_obj) on my local
 sanuj	and it works fine
 sanuj	but the problems is then there won't be symmetry in sets(), gets() and has()
 sanuj	problem*
 sanuj	i.e.
 sanuj	k.sets("name", kurva_obj) will work
 sanuj	but k.gets("name") will not work
 sanuj	k.getsKurvaMachine("name") and k.gets(tag_kurva_machine) will work

@wiking	c4goldsw, yoyoyo
@wiking	i've merged your lars
 c4goldsw	Earth to wiking, looks like the build worked!
@wiking	fixes
 c4goldsw	Saw
@wiking	yep yep
 c4goldsw	Good
@wiking	and it's memleak free \o/
 c4goldsw	That's what I was looking for
 c4goldsw	wiking doing well?
@wiking	yep yep thnx
 c4goldsw	Good.
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.19.62] has joined #shogun
@wiking	c4goldsw, how's your refactor going?
 c4goldsw	wiking: Slowly, taking my time.  I did LDA a few days ago but, when doing a unit test, the outputs are completely different for one test and the same for another.
 c4goldsw	It's odd, but I've yet to put it through a debugger.
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	yeah gdb/lldb is usually something that helps a lot
@wiking	a good friday read btw: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938v2.pdf
 c4goldsw	Haha, the title.
 c4goldsw	wiking: school starts in four weeks or so - during that time, I'll try doing at least a class a week.
@wiking	:D
@wiking	woah
@wiking	great man!
@wiking	highly appreciated :)
@wiking	what's your major in?
 c4goldsw	CS, I want to go into ML
 c4goldsw	I'm going into my third year of undergrad.
@wiking	which school?
 c4goldsw	U of T, the school hinton works at.
 c4goldsw	Good for ML / AI.
 c4goldsw	* Hinton
@wiking	btw you know we have a track record of having people getting accepted to MIT :)
@wiking	so people contributing (gsoc or otherwise)
 c4goldsw	Hahaha, I think the top tier schools are a little out of my reach.  I have a 3.65 right now, hoping to bump it up.
 c4goldsw	I'm aiming for Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, Edinburgh, etc.
@wiking	heheh i have no idea about gpes and sat-s
@wiking	just heard them in movie
@wiking	*s
@wiking	:D
@wiking	i have a friend working at Edinburgh uni
@wiking	had one in oxford but now he is back in mexico
 c4goldsw	Where did you study?
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	bsc+msc at budapest university of technology
@wiking	then my phd at ghent university, belgium
@wiking	and i was for a while a researcher at australian national uni
@wiking	nothing fancy :)
 c4goldsw	How'd you wind up in Singapore?
@wiking	my wife got here a position
@wiking	so i came with the luggage
 c4goldsw	Sprichst du Deutsch?
@wiking	y0 bissl
 c4goldsw	Arbietest du als Hausmann jetzt? ;)
@wiking	hahahah ja
 c4goldsw	Informatik is mein Hauptfach, Deutsch ist mein Nebenfach.
 c4goldsw	afk
@wiking	sorry
@wiking	was away
@wiking	ja, ich habe in wien drei jahre gewohnt...
@wiking	so yeah
@wiking	but that was a long time ago
@wiking	almost lost all my german
@wiking	mainly i understand still everything
@wiking	but speaking.... especially my writing is horrendeous
 sanuj	wiking, who went to MIT?
@wiking	sanuj, i think some of them are still there
@wiking	pluskid
@wiking	https://github.com/pluskid
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	the mocha guy
@wiking	i think we have like 2 more
 sanuj	c4goldsw, mine is even worse
 sanuj	7..71/10
 sanuj	7.71
 sanuj	lisitsyn, wazzup
@wiking	jacob walker is at cmu now
@wiking	so it used to be a good thing :)
 lisitsyn	hey
 sanuj	wiking, yeah
 sanuj	:)
 lisitsyn	samara state aerospace university here
@wiking	lisitsyn, :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	best of the best
@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	6921 in the world rating
@wiking	\o/
@wiking	those ratings are actually bullshit
 lisitsyn	the best people
 sanuj	lisitsyn, why did you do masters?
@wiking	Saurabh7, ping?
 lisitsyn	why not
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i actually had a question
@wiking	lisitsyn, did you have an option?
@wiking	lisitsyn, to do it or not?
 lisitsyn	go to army
 lisitsyn	maybe
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn, i had no option....
 sanuj	lisitsyn, oh that happens in russia
 sanuj	is it like israel?
 Saurabh7	wiking: yo
 sanuj	like you have to serve in the army
@wiking	Saurabh7, so what with knn
 lisitsyn	you have to but you can avoid that
@wiking	?
@wiking	i took much longer than expected :)
@wiking	Saurabh7, but anyhow if this is green
@wiking	and i can dig through the code
@wiking	can u look at the next task we discussed?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i'm considering masters in US, but it's damn costly
@wiking	sanuj, i would *never* pay for education
@wiking	:)
@wiking	get a scholarship
 sanuj	not good grades
 Saurabh7	wiking: yes, I removed most external code, should be ok now
 sanuj	is there another way to get scholarship?
 sanuj	haha
 Saurabh7	i will send that on top of this
@wiking	ok
 sanuj	PhD can be funded :D
 lisitsyn	oh introducing other policy to any
 lisitsyn	broke too much
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ohkay
 lisitsyn	I am still struggling with SG_ADD
 lisitsyn	but its close
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we have this in swig
 sanuj	%template(TagKernel) Tag<CKernel*>;
 lisitsyn	yeah?
 lisitsyn	and?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i have forgotten why we decided on CKernel* :D
 sanuj	i mean why the pointer
 lisitsyn	because we have to stick with pointers
 lisitsyn	all the typemaps are working with pointers
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i remember something like, i tried CKernel but it was not working
 sanuj	so moved to pointers
 sanuj	but i don't remember exactly what
 lisitsyn	it can't be CKernel
 lisitsyn	it should be either Some<CKernel> or CKernel*
 lisitsyn	otherwise nothing is shared
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, sets("gaussian", kernel) also works instead of setsKernel("gaussian", kernel)
 sanuj	i checked it on local
 sanuj	but this would break the symmetry in sets(), gets(), has()
 lisitsyn	you mean type is changed?
 sanuj	wiking went crazy after i told him that our api is like setsX("name", X_obj)
 sanuj	:D
 lisitsyn	well that's the only way
 sanuj	so i tried sets("name", X_obj) and it also works
 lisitsyn	ahhh
 lisitsyn	I get what you mean by symmetry
 lisitsyn	set/getKernel
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but gets("name") won't work unless you find a better implementation
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i mean, type info is saved in the Any object
 sanuj	can't we recast it without passing the type info via getsX()?
 lisitsyn	no
 sanuj	hmmm
 lisitsyn	it could be possibly done in python
 lisitsyn	maybe wiking's favourite js
 lisitsyn	but no java and no c++
@wiking	:>
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we will have to save the type info in the map in SGObject::Self
 sanuj	but i guess that is not desired
 lisitsyn	it is not about saving the type
 lisitsyn	you just can't have variable return type
 lisitsyn	<??> gets()
 sanuj	lisitsyn, c++ limits us in this way
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	well you can stay in Any type as long as you can
 lisitsyn	it can be done
 lisitsyn	speaking of symmetry
 lisitsyn	may be it is ok to get a little bit asymmetrical
 lisitsyn	we set much more often than we get
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	so shall i change it?
 lisitsyn	I don't mind
 lisitsyn	probably it is better
 sanuj	but then usage of TagX in sets() would be totally redundant
 lisitsyn	why?
 sanuj	obj.sets(tag_x, obj_x)
 sanuj	obj.sets("name_x", obj_x)
 sanuj	everyone will use the latter one
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	who will make a Tag object
 lisitsyn	no reason except performance
 sanuj	lisitsyn, is Tag more efficient?
 lisitsyn	well you don't compute hash
 sanuj	oh yeah
 sanuj	lisitsyn, cool, i'll keep both
 sanuj	lisitsyn, shall we do the next steps in plugins after GSoC ends?
 lisitsyn	yeah maybe
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i'll focus on readmes now
 sanuj	lisitsyn, one more thing
 sanuj	shall i move this:
 sanuj	#ifdef HAVE_JINJA2
 sanuj	%include "shogun-base.i"
 sanuj	#endif
 sanuj	from SGBase.i to modshogun.i?
 lisitsyn	no idea
 sanuj	because then
 sanuj	i can replace statements like this
 sanuj	%template(TagRealVector) Tag<SGVector<float64_t>*>;
 sanuj	to
 sanuj	%template(TagRealVector) Tag<RealVector*>;
 sanuj	as RealVector is defined in Library.i
 lisitsyn	ok
 sanuj	but Library.i is not visible in SGBase.i
 lisitsyn	move it then
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i'm moving it back to SGBase.i
 sanuj	because it still gives the same error
