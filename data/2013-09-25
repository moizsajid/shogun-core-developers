 sonne|work	iglesiasg: is the SOSVM SGD solver PR ready to be merged? I guess you take care of it...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, no, it is not. Patrick wrote some comments yesterday that need to be addressed
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, and we need unit tests, hushell said he was on it
 sonne|work	ok
 wiking	yo
* wiking is back from a 2 days flu downtime
 gsomix	sonne|work, yep. just a moment
 wiking	sonne|work: png
 wiking	ping
 sonne|work	wiking: a real phoenix you are
 wiking	gsomix: ok i'm back now
 wiking	sonne|work: fuck man flu took me badly
 wiking	sonne|work: have u managed to change the script on 7nn for notebook generation?
 sonne|work	wiking: lots of people here are out too
 sonne|work	wiking: didn't do anything
 sonne|work	wiking: we need the protoc support for gsomix
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah i know
 wiking	sonne|work: can u plz do the changes according to https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1482
 sonne|work	wiking: tonight
 wiking	sonne|work: okie thnx
 wiking	ok so somebody who's protobuf person
 wiking	how does the .cc gets generated?
 sonne|work	wiking: protoc --cpp *.proto
 sonne|work	wiking: actually protoc filename.proto --cpp_out=OUT_DIR
 wiking	sonne|work: ok and this has not been written yet right?
 sonne|work	wiking: no - we have a commented PROTOBUF detection in there though
 wiking	okok
 wiking	sonne|work: fixing it now
 wiking	btw
 wiking	do we need the protobuf headers and library?
 wiking	i have no idea about how protobuf works
 wiking	that's why i'm asking
 wiking	btw are we going to have .proto files anywhere else?
 wiking	other than src/shogun?
 sonne|work	wiking: well we could put them at some other place if you mean that... it is kind of the .i files - special
 wiking	nono
 wiking	i mean that are we going to have them elsewhere as well/
 wiking	just to know what to expect
 wiking	i'm fine with it as it is now
 sonne|work	ok then just use the current location
 wiking	are these the files that should be generated?
 wiking	/Users/wiking/shogun/build/src/shogun/Chunks.pb.h/Users/wiking/shogun/build/src/shogun/Headers.pb.h/Users/wiking/shogun/build/src/shogun/ShogunVersion.pb.h

 wiking	or i guess they are in the wrong location...:S
 wiking	wonder how to fix this with cmake...
 gsomix	sonne|work, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1670 updated!

@iglesiasg	besser82, morning
 besser82	iglesiasg: thanks, mornin'  :D
 besser82	iglesiasg: How is it going?  I'm just compiling / test new checkout with updated data :)
@iglesiasg	besser82, nice. Yeah , it is a data set used in the lmnn notebook
@iglesiasg	a small one about wines.. yummy :D
 besser82	iglesiasg: XD   wines are always tasty  ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, and Spanish ones even better
 besser82	iglesiasg, you should definetivly taste some German ones, like those "Badische" Wines  ;)
 besser82	iglesiasg, made in "Baden-W?rttemberg"

@iglesiasg	besser82, deffs I should. I don't recall having tried German wine actully :/
 besser82	iglesiasg,  give them shot  :)  You can get pretty drunk from them, but feeling really good next day ;)
 besser82	sonne|work:  Still no answer from TJ for SVMlight :(  He actually is a German, isn't he?
-!- new_lido [~walid@193.227.20.2] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	besser82: yes he is!
 besser82	sonne|work:  :D As I supposed.  So he should be able to read my mail  ;)  Probably he's on vacation or so.
 sonne|work	besser82: well he is a big shot with little time
 besser82	sonne|work: Or he just doesn't want to answer  :(
 shogun-buildbot	build #149 of precise - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/precise%20-%20libshogun/builds/149
 sonne|work	besser82: we thought a couple of times writing 'SVM^bright'
 besser82	sonne|work: ???
 sonne|work	totally GPL'd svm light clone
 besser82	sonne|work: that would be cool, indeed  ;)
 sonne|work	but then libsvm etc are doing good enough
 besser82	sonne|work: but isn't redistable  :(
 sonne|work	yeah I know even worse I would say. not allowed to modify etc etc
 sonne|work	I would very much like to get rid of it altogether
 besser82	sonne|work: yes, but is there any suitable substitue?
 sonne|work	besser82: in principle there is but this version here is pimped (like the libsvm in shogun)
 sonne|work	so they can be a bit faster (parallel, faster kernels, ...)
 besser82	sonne|work: which one would be the substitute?  Perhaps I can take care of  ;)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1542 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1542  blamelist: lambday <heavensdevil6909@gmail.com>, Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 sonne|work	besser82: GPBTSVM is also a chunking based svm like svm light
 sonne|work	besser82: they claim to have a faster internal solver being able to process bigger chunks per iteration
 sonne|work	however it doesn't do shrinking
 besser82	sonne|work: so let me do some experiments with it  ;)  PErhaps we can replace SVMlight with this one, to be completely FOSS again ;)
 sonne|work	and does not have the various hacks to make convergence more stable
 sonne|work	besser82: it is in shogun already
 besser82	sonne|work: so another bundled thingy  ;)
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 besser82	sonne|work: I'll try to rewrite a binary / API compatible FOSS version of SVMlight, then  ;)
 lisitsyn	what?
 lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	besser82: looks like you have too much time :)
 besser82	sonne|work: Yes, sometimes ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: better do cmake fixes :)
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm on them :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I believe it only makes sense to implement something that is *better* than svmlight
 besser82	sonne|work: btw. How about that "`make install` downloads stuff" thing?
 besser82	sonne|work: That would be a tough thing to write ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: The better than SVMlight...
 lisitsyn	besser82: well it is quite old so there must be some room for improvement
 lisitsyn	otherwise we are all stupid
 besser82	lisitsyn: possibly there is, but I'm not too skilled in writing code ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is about math I think
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am skilled in code but my brain is not capable to cope with that math haha
 lisitsyn	well I didn't try but I am pessimistic about it
 besser82	lisitsyn: that would be my domain  ;)  Let me try to understand the SVMlight sources ... ;)
 sonne|work	horrible
 sonne|work	don't even try to do that
 lisitsyn	yeah never try to read research code
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, sonne|work:  :D  I can't code that well, but im BSc applied Maths  ;)
 sonne|work	like shogun you mean?
 lisitsyn	besser82: same shit here, doesn't help :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: Let's fetch some Asian then to do it  ;)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: shogun is much more closer to industrial code now
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's a good point
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yeah true the buildbot armada is actually as good as it gets IMHO
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: I don't have to tell you about research code I believe :D
 lisitsyn	you must have seen terrible things
 lisitsyn	much more terrible than I have seen
 sonne|work	sure
 sonne|work	I wrote it myself back then

 KMcQuisten	Hi there folks
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: hey
 lisitsyn	nice to see you here again ;)
 KMcQuisten	So, i've been trying to compile new versions of shogun using cmake, and no matter what I do, it just won't compile.  It will compile all the c++ objects, but then it just craps out whenever it tries to compile the python wrapper, and I can't figure out why.  Iv'e fiddled with every last parameter to point in things in what I think are the right directions, but it never works.  I need to update to fix some bugs, but it just isn't w

@iglesiasg	KMcQuisten, what kind of errors do you get?
@iglesiasg	KMcQuisten, what do you see related to python paths when you do ccmake ..?
@iglesiasg	maybe you can check in there if the variables are well assigned for cmake
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: yeah please paste errors
 lisitsyn	somewhere
 KMcQuisten	I've been using a cmake gui, cmake28.  ccmake is not a command that my terminal recognizes
 besser82	KMcQuisten: you're on RHEL6, right?  ;)
 KMcQuisten	i'm aon a Centos6 workstation.  I went through hell for a while becasue it was not very clearly announced that python 2.6 would not be supported.  2.6 is the version my distro uses for its package manager, so I can't remove it.
 KMcQuisten	so i've installed 2.7 in a local director and i've been pointing cmake to those directories
 KMcQuisten	I don't have specific errors in front of me, because I rage-deleted my source folder
 KMcQuisten	I have to clone the repo again
 besser82	KMcQuisten: try ccmake28 or ccmake-2.8
 KMcQuisten	the errors are all errors saying the the objects don't contain the propertiesthey are supposed to.
 KMcQuisten	One moment
 besser82	KMcQuisten: and I guess your main problem is numpy or scipy.... not Python2.6  ;)
 KMcQuisten	I freshly recomiled numpy and scipy to use python2.7
 KMcQuisten	I ran and tested numpy and scipy in the python 2.7 interpreter and they were playing nicely
 besser82	OK
 besser82	try to build them for Py2.6 and all should be fine, without python2.7  ;)
 KMcQuisten	They're already built and installed for 2.6
 besser82	which versions?
 besser82	stock CentOS6?
 KMcQuisten	numpy 1.6.2 and scipy0.12.0
 KMcQuisten	i built them from source.  I dind't use what was in the centos repo
 besser82	should be recent enough...
 besser82	mhhh....
 KMcQuisten	yes, stock centos6
 KMcQuisten	if py2.6 is still supported, why to the installation instructions say it's no longer supported?
 besser82	I dunno....
 besser82	I'm curently working on RPMs for shogun supporting EL5 / EL6 and Fedora 18+
 besser82	And didn't run to Python problems whether on el5 nor el6
 besser82	yet...
 besser82	those rpms will be available during "official" channels btw.
 besser82	EPEL repo for el5/el6...
 KMcQuisten	That would be lovely.  What's the timeframe on that?
 besser82	est. 3 - 4 weeks  (depends on factor I can't influence)
 KMcQuisten	well that will be nice.
 KMcQuisten	hopefully I will not have bashed my skull in from frustration by then ;)
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: so basically the only reason it stopped to work is cmake?
 KMcQuisten	Yeah, when you guys changed over to cmake, I couldn't get it to work anymore
 lisitsyn	sorry I still don't get what is the exact error
 KMcQuisten	I can see the reasoning.  autotools are ancient and inflexible.  I'm compiling again so I can post the actual error
 besser82	that would be nice ;)
 lisitsyn	ok thanks
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: please bug us till we help you because it is us who should care about it
 lisitsyn	it is we* I mean
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I tried to use multiboost
 lisitsyn	crazy
 lisitsyn	command line oriented classifiers
 lisitsyn	I haven't thought it can be that bad
 shogun-buildbot	build #1546 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1546  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 lisitsyn	these guys don't give a shit how to code..
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what is it you didn't like? :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, all right. Did you like something :P?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I want to use multiboost in C++
 lisitsyn	so how NORMAL PEOPLE do that
 lisitsyn	they include shit and compile and link
 lisitsyn	and see how it goes
@iglesiasg	aaah it is just usable from the command line?
@iglesiasg	no API?
 lisitsyn	y
 lisitsyn	e
 lisitsyn	s
 lisitsyn	it takes Args
 lisitsyn	okay I thought
 lisitsyn	I'll put my arguments to args
 lisitsyn	and it will work
 lisitsyn	but THERE IS NO METHOD TO SET ARGS
 lisitsyn	they just parse them
 lisitsyn	how can one think it is normal to do that?!
@iglesiasg	crazy
 KMcQuisten	Becasue most coders of scientific software are graduate students, not professional software developers?
 KMcQuisten	You guys are the glaring exception to this fact.  Even your graduate student coders write stuff that's readable and makes sense.
 shogun-buildbot	build #1894 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1894
 KMcQuisten	It's quite impressive
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: these multiboost developers are not really students I think
 lisitsyn	oh sometimes I don't understand what researchers do because I code all the time to try something new
 lisitsyn	how can one say come up with a new classifier w/o programming skills
 KMcQuisten	I think their goal is just to get something that works without thinking about how it fits into pipelines and frameworks, and without thinking about the design of their code as somethign that's important in and of itself
 lisitsyn	it is usually about self-discipline
 lisitsyn	it doesn't help at all
 KMcQuisten	Exactly.  Shit code can be done quickly, good code takes time, effort, critical thinking, and patience
 lisitsyn	you build bad designed tool
 lisitsyn	then you use it
 lisitsyn	and spend time
 lisitsyn	because of its bad design
 KMcQuisten	Exactly.  It's short-term thinking causing long-term delay
 KMcQuisten	doing it right puts the long term first, but then adaptation and change is straightforward when code's designed well
 lisitsyn	yeah you just save your time doing it right
 lisitsyn	that's why I don't understand it
@iglesiasg	it is just about getting results and writing papers
@iglesiasg	the faster you get results, the sooner you can a write a paper with sth
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: haha! that's why I won't join that
@iglesiasg	just a thought
@iglesiasg	probably not all are like that
 KMcQuisten	Exactly.  they just want their answers and don't care adfter that
 lisitsyn	I have been convinced by all the stuff coming around that research is shit :D
 lisitsyn	the more industry related it is the better it gets
 lisitsyn	once you need something real the game changes
 KMcQuisten	I'd say that's pretty accurate.  Companies want code that can be read and understood by someone who didn't write it
 lisitsyn	it seems to be quite frustrating to me
 KMcQuisten	I agree totally.  Well designed code makes your life so much easier
 KMcQuisten	I absolutely love the work you guys put into this, especially all the unit testing.
 KMcQuisten	ok, I have some errors for you:
 lisitsyn	oh finally
 lisitsyn	godo
 lisitsyn	good

 lisitsyn	ha
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: do you have shogun installed already?
 KMcQuisten	Yes, i've left the old version alone so I could still get some work done while I was trying to figure this out
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: is it in /usr/local/include?
 KMcQuisten	nope, it's in usr/include
 lisitsyn	oh even that
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: could you move it out of the folder
 lisitsyn	try to compile and get it back later
 KMcQuisten	Which folder?
 lisitsyn	I mean move shogun headers out of /usr/include
 lisitsyn	I have a suspect
 KMcQuisten	I can try, but why would that matter for compilation?
 lisitsyn	lets see if he goes in custody
 lisitsyn	well it uses old headers but new sources
 KMcQuisten	But I have it pointing ot hte new headers
 KMcQuisten	ok, I'll try it
 KMcQuisten	:)
 lisitsyn	I have seen csv_data_order before
 lisitsyn	and it was the culprit
 KMcQuisten	ok, moved the old headers out of usr/include
 KMcQuisten	Ugh, it's recompiling everything.
 KMcQuisten	this might be a minute
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: I believe it should solve the problem
 KMcQuisten	Here's hoping! :)

 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: argh
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: different errors though
 KMcQuisten	No no, same errors, I just gave you a different flavor.  There's about 6 pages of them
 lisitsyn	ah
 KMcQuisten	it's not finding a header somewhere, but I can't figure out where or why
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: well there is really no such method like get_posterior_approximation_covariance
 KMcQuisten	Is that deprecated or something?  It's sure looking for it
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: are you sure you don't have any other shogun headers in your include path?
 lisitsyn	/usr/include /usr/local/include etc
 KMcQuisten	it's possible
 KMcQuisten	why would it be looking there during compilation, though?  I'm working from a fresh pull of the repo in my home directory.
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: that's an issue with cmake we have
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: once you have include paths it is a matter of their order I guess
 lisitsyn	we didn't have such problems with make cause we did control the order explicitly
 KMcQuisten	I see
 lisitsyn	I still think it is the reason
 KMcQuisten	Let me check where things are
 lisitsyn	KMcQuisten: just look for that "get_posterior_approximation_covariance"
 lisitsyn	there should be a file swig takes it from
