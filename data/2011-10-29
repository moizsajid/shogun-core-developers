 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * re9c8ecd / src/interfaces/lua_modular/swig_typemaps.i : fix an error in the lua typemaps (checking for the typecode without using strcmp) - http://git.io/PIgx2g

 blackburn	sonney2k: wow you did a lot of fixes

 supernaught	sonney2k: When you say "use the signum of these numbers, e.g. if the sign is negative then it is a letter from group A, if positve then from group B"
 supernaught	how do I feed in a number for which training has not been done?
 supernaught	e.g. In the program, one creates points {0,1,2} with labels {-1,1,-1}
 supernaught	but when I attempt to extrapolate from my inputs and determine which group {3} belongs to, I pull an exception "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'shogun::ShogunException'"
 blackburn1	supernaught: are you doing multi-class classification?
 supernaught	I believe not
 blackburn1	how many letter groups you have?
 supernaught	I'm working with third one from top at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/developer_tutorial.html
 supernaught	I'm not sure what a letter group is
 blackburn1	well you said group A, group B, ..?
 supernaught	oh, sure
 blackburn1	and there are only A and B, right?
 supernaught	2
 supernaught	+1, -1
 supernaught	yes
 blackburn1	and you set up labels with +1 and -1
 blackburn1	and got exception?
 supernaught	yes
 supernaught	the example is nearly verbatim what I have
 supernaught	except when I go to "classify over training variables"
 supernaught	I loop from 0 to 4 instead of 0 to 3
 blackburn1	can you send the example reproducing the error to me?
 supernaught	sure
 blackburn1	I would check it and fix then
 blackburn1	or say what is wrong
 supernaught	let me paste it somewhere
 blackburn1	just send it by email
 blackburn1	to blackburn91@gmail.com
-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
 blackburn	supernaught: btw what are the features you do use?
 supernaught	https://gist.github.com/1325029
 blackburn	ah sure gist works too
 supernaught	I'm a complete newb to machine learning
 supernaught	I'm not sure what you mean by "features" ?
 blackburn	hmm for example simple features is just dense vectors
 blackburn	[1,2,3,4]
 supernaught	whoops, I forgot the error
 blackburn	and feature is 1 and 2 and 3 and 4
 blackburn	then [1,2,3,4] is a feature vector
 blackburn	and matrix containing feature vector is a feature matrix
 supernaught	ok
 blackburn	but sometimes feature vector is just a string ("some string")
 blackburn	and there is no feature matrix
 supernaught	Ok: so a feature vector is an input which is used for training?
 blackburn	yes, it is vector representing some object
 supernaught	ok. Lingo :)
 blackburn	something like that :)
 blackburn	okay
 supernaught	so in this case, I am using a feature vector of [0,1,2,3,4,5]
 blackburn	so do you understand what are train set and test set?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	[[0,2,4],
 blackburn	 [1,3,5]]
 blackburn	it is a feature matrix
 supernaught	oh, right
 blackburn	[0,1] [2,3] [4,5] is a feature vectors
 supernaught	and the fortran-style indexing
 supernaught	gotcha
 blackburn	yeah old-school hah
 blackburn	okay I got it
 blackburn	about train features and test features
 blackburn	you are trying to classify 4th object/vector
 blackburn	that are not here anyhow
 supernaught	perhaps I am misunderstanding a training and a test
 supernaught	you say
 supernaught	this makes sense
 supernaught	how do I input some test data then ?
 blackburn	supernaught: you could use set_features
 blackburn	or apply to whole features
 supernaught	I will check out the documentation now
 blackburn	well we have pretty bad doc
 supernaught	just so I am sure,
 blackburn	svm->apply(features)
 blackburn	will return CLabels instance
 blackburn	when you can get classified labels
 blackburn	supernaught: btw why are you using C++ for doing that?
 supernaught	so what is happening is I will get:     <interpretted/classified data>   =  svm->apply(  <test data>  );
 supernaught	?
 supernaught	I am tinkering with embedding shogun in a set of medical physics libraries which are written in c++
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	apply(features) returns CLabels
 blackburn	which are containing labels (-1,+1,..)
 supernaught	Awesome. Thanks for the clarification. I'll check out the documentation and come back when I get stuck again :)
 blackburn	i.e. the results of classification
 supernaught	thanks!
 blackburn	you could just ask here :)
 supernaught	unfortunately I never seem to learn anything unless I struggle through it a little
 supernaught	maybe it is 'starving artist' syndrome
 supernaught	: /
 blackburn	everyone do the same I guess
 blackburn	https://gist.github.com/1325045
 blackburn	good thing is you understand my broken english :D
 supernaught	not a problem
 supernaught	thanks again - this is some unbelieveably cool software
 supernaught	I'm grateful, thanks
 blackburn	supernaught: in the example I sent to you
 blackburn	there are features and features_test
 blackburn	ah I did it wrong
 blackburn	okay when there are features and features_test
 blackburn	and if you do svm->train with features
 blackburn	and then svm->apply with features_test
 blackburn	you will get classification results
 supernaught	:D
 blackburn	supernaught: it is nice to hear our software is any cool :)
 supernaught	Ok
 supernaught	I understand
 supernaught	one more question, though
 supernaught	how stable is the c++ api ?
 blackburn	supernaught: in what means?
 supernaught	in a few years, will I be able to compile my code?
 supernaught	e.g. shogun is 1.0.0 right now. How much will things change at 8.0.0 ?
 blackburn	oh, I hope so
 blackburn	are you doing eternal software? :D
 supernaught	in the medical world, everything is supposed to be 'eternal' and 'error-free'
 supernaught	;)
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	I'm not sure about every method but I think apply/train/CLabels/etc things won't be changed
 supernaught	cool
 supernaught	Well, I'm off for now. I'll catch you later blackburn
 blackburn	supernaught: okay see you
 blackburn	supernaught: I'm really interested with attaching shogun to any other software (as Soeren does too) - so don't hesitate to ask
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r5ced67a / (src/shogun/base/SGObject.cpp src/shogun/base/SGObject.h): Fixed spacings at SGObject - http://git.io/I0J7rQ
 supernaught	blackburn: the application will be a compatibility layer between raw medical data and a uniform-surface application layer
 blackburn	supernaught: I see, I hope that will work
 supernaught	it is a for a master's thesis, but the (public) organization I work for covers a large part of Canada
 supernaught	and they are eager to adopt it
 supernaught	so I would _love_ to put shogun to work
 blackburn	supernaught: what are the tasks that software specialize with?
 blackburn	supernaught: anyway as I said before don't hesitate to ask me or Soeren and if there is no one of us here - ask on the mailing list or by email
