 n4nd0	wiking: hello hello
 wiking	n4nd0: hey
 wiking	so here's a question
 wiking	ok i'll put it in latex format just a sec
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	so it's the usual struct svm: \min_{w,\xi_i >= 0} \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2_2 + C \sum_{n} \xi_n
 wiking	with s.t.
 wiking	\forall n \in pos\  w*\Psi(x_n, y_n) >= 1 - \xi_n
 wiking	\forall n \in neg \forall y\  w*\Psi(x_n, y) =< -1 + \xi_n
 wiking	{pos} = positive examples
 wiking	{neg} = negatives
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	how would u construct this problem with PrimalMosek? :)
 n4nd0	mmm let's see
 n4nd0	wiking: you don't want to use the loss anywhere?
 wiking	noup
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so right now what the Primal does looks similar to the positive constraints
 wiking	mmm isn't it w* \delta\psi(...)
 wiking	?
 wiking	where \delta psi is \psi(...) - \psi(...)
 n4nd0	oh yeah sorry
 wiking	prediction - ground truth
 n4nd0	I read \Psi like that directly, sorry
 n4nd0	mmmm
 n4nd0	so it looks to me like that problem cannot be solved with it right now
 n4nd0	some things should be added / modified
 n4nd0	what I mean is that I don't think there is a way to do it directly with the current implementation, like changing some input or parameter
 wiking	yep
