 jmfavreau	or do I have to use the serialized version?

 n4nd0	sonney2k: around?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am here instead of him :D
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	n4nd0:
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha ok
 n4nd0	so I will fire at you
 n4nd0	but I already asked you about this the other day, it is same question but rephrased
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you happen to know how well the structured SVM may work with continuous structured data?
 n4nd0	think for example of something like an HMM
 n4nd0	where the states are also real numbers
 blackburn	ahh that time series
 n4nd0	(i.e. a linear dynamical system)
 blackburn	I actually think it is kind of wrong
 blackburn	SVM is here just to estimate dependencies we doesn't happen to know
 blackburn	if you need parameters it is math
 blackburn	but may be I don't get it a little
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	when you say if you need parameters it is math
 blackburn	yeah I think so
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean it like parameter estimation in the sense of a generative model?
 blackburn	kind of, yes
 n4nd0	well but you can use SVM as an alternative to generative models
 blackburn	I see nothing discriminative in estimation of A,B,C,D of linear system
 n4nd0	discriminative models more in general
 n4nd0	but it is discriminative in the sense that if I tell you
 n4nd0	take a look to these observations
 n4nd0	now tell me where did they come from, what was the state of the system them
 n4nd0	there a lot of possible states
 n4nd0	you find one of them
 blackburn	yeah but I feel it a little cumbersome
 n4nd0	hehe I don't understand why :)
 blackburn	can't prove :D my ass feeling
 n4nd0	the thing is I am not trying to estimate the parameters A, B, C and D of the system in an SVM fashion
 blackburn	I don't understand how structured svm works
 blackburn	yes I understand the math and some cases like multiclass but I don't realize what is it in case of infinite states
 n4nd0	yeah me neither
 n4nd0	I don't really know if it can even work
 n4nd0	let me show you a part of a paper
 blackburn	I have an feeling that it can be wrong actually :D
 blackburn	SO comes from crammer and singer formulation with basic generalization
 n4nd0	http://vision.lbl.gov/Conferences/cvpr/Papers/data/papers/1099.pdf
 blackburn	I have no reasons left behind to do that, so it is all pretty doubtful for me
 n4nd0	second page
 n4nd0	second column
 n4nd0	they say something like
 n4nd0	CRFs, SO-SVM and others
 n4nd0	are for structured prediction case for *discrete* outputs
 n4nd0	and that there are generatilizations to *continuous* outputs
 blackburn	right
 n4nd0	the reference for this one is related to kernel density estimation with joint kernel maps
 blackburn	n4nd0: just recalled, did I told you I received two mails about tapkee already?
 n4nd0	and actually the paper ^ with this SOAR thingy looks kind of for this continuous outputs too
 n4nd0	blackburn: I read something you mentioned in a conversation with Heiko or maybe it was with Viktor
 blackburn	n4nd0: I should read the paper to understand it more
 n4nd0	something about a graduate student and later the professor IIRC?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah me too
 blackburn	n4nd0: I was wrong actually
 blackburn	totally different people
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	in means of relations
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have not diffed into these papers yet
 blackburn	different cities even
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: that's even better, more users
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you seen I set up google analytics?
 blackburn	we should install it to the shogun page too
 n4nd0	I saw the fancy github page you sent me
 n4nd0	but I don't think that is what you meant, is it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: oops how can you see :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what? :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am the only user who sees this I guess
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay I set up js script on index.html
 blackburn	that collects data about visits
 n4nd0	oh I could see that because you sent me a link yesterday hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: link to?
 n4nd0	the fancy webpage I was talking about
 blackburn	http://lisitsyn.github.com/tapkee/
 blackburn	that one?
 n4nd0	but I think that doesn't have anything to do with google anlytics, not sure though
 n4nd0	yep
 blackburn	check sources
 blackburn	it has some kind of collecting script
 n4nd0	mm I don't find what you are saying
 blackburn	n4nd0: check index.hmtl
 blackburn	https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/gh-pages/index.html
 n4nd0	I see something with google analytics there
 blackburn	yeah and I have access to that data
 n4nd0	blackburn: is it storing in there every time we get a visit?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	that's kind of cool :)
 n4nd0	what do you want to do with that data?
 blackburn	nothing it is just interesting to see that
 n4nd0	indeed hehe
 n4nd0	http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js
 blackburn	n4nd0: the page has 14 unique visitors so far
 n4nd0	that file is quite unreadable for me at least
 n4nd0	blackburn: where do you see that?
 blackburn	in the google analytics account
 blackburn	I am searchng a way to share that somehow
 blackburn	n4nd0: I've added you
 blackburn	check the GA
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can it too now
 n4nd0	really cool
 n4nd0	I can see*
 blackburn	we can haz statz
 n4nd0	so all these statistics are about the fancy webpage
 n4nd0	not the normal github one, right?
 blackburn	right
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am excited about shogun's workshop
 blackburn	I am too
 n4nd0	blackburn: are you planning to stay in Berlin for some days?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes I hope so
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	I should find some travel offer
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	we will probably know more of it and can start planning better after the meeting tom
 blackburn	cause I don't want to deal with visa :D
 blackburn	some travelling company should take care of this I hope
 blackburn	so the meeting is tomorrow right?
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	I managed to miss that mail somehow
 n4nd0	blackburn: there it goes
 blackburn	n4nd0: hah thanks I meant I just missed it in my box
 n4nd0	haha whatever
 blackburn	hmm 20 utc
 blackburn	so for me it is hmmm
 n4nd0	here it is 21
 n4nd0	so there 23 I think
 blackburn	24
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	russia is controlled by aliens so +4
 blackburn	they prefer when sunset happens like 3:20 or so
 n4nd0	aaah
@sonney2k	n4nd0, don't trust the aliens
@sonney2k	blackburn, recall that we have analytics for years on shogun-toolbox.org
 blackburn	sonney2k: really?
@sonney2k	you just didn't want to have access to it...
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ohh I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: no you always told me you don't have exact stats
 blackburn	some misunderstanding happened
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have no download stats but all the rest I have
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you share it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I offered this to you > 1 year ago
 blackburn	I am constantly drunk come on
 blackburn	be merciful

 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	and you didn't need the money I know :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you've got mail
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice load we have
 blackburn	sonney2k: posting that we use eigen leads to 60 clicks :D
 blackburn	interesting
 blackburn	from the eigen3 site
 blackburn	sleep time
