@sonney2k	blackburn, I am surprised by the java examples not working report
@sonney2k	I heard this now from 3 independent people
@sonney2k	but I have no clue why they all have that problem
@sonney2k	I mean I recall that we tested this thoroughly
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh have you run make check-examples recently?
@sonney2k	things fail here on converters

 blackburn	sonney2k:  oh sorry I haven't checked it
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the error?
@sonney2k	errors everywhere ... go check it...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm really out of time today
 blackburn	sonney2k: possibly it related to my preprocessor->converter conversion
 blackburn	but I do not know why others could fail
