@sonney2k	n4nd0, IIRC the regularization term just adds sth to the diagonal of the cov matrix
@sonney2k	so it penalizes non-zero weights in w
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I would say have a look at QDA in scikits learn and follow the reference above
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw it would make a lot of sense to create one graphical example illustrating lda/qda/ lda on polyfeatures
@sonney2k	so we see how they differ :)
@sonney2k	at least I would love to see that
@sonney2k	so yes QDA is of interest especially when just running LDA on PolyFeatures
@sonney2k	for comparison
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have been studying the code from scikits before, I think I got ir more or less
 n4nd0	I have not seen the direct relation to the theory I read though
 n4nd0	they use SVD to compute the covariances what I found surprising at first sight
 n4nd0	would you like to have sth graphical like this?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes sth like this
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will work on that then :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do they use SVD for computing the inverse?
@sonney2k	pseudo inverse I mean
 n4nd0	sonney2k: mmm I am not sure, by the name of their variables it looks like they compute the covariance, not the inverse
 blackburn	eigs of XX' are left singular vectors
 blackburn	eigvectors I mean
 blackburn	damn are you crazy guys? pretty late
 n4nd0	it is this fragment of code where they do it http://snipt.org/ufHf0
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha my gf was sick today so I have been wandering around home almost the whole day and didn't work that much :P
 blackburn	oh let she recover soon
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we compute pseudo inverse for LDA too via SVD
@sonney2k	/The pseudo inverse A+ can be constructed from the singular value
@sonney2k	/decomposition A = UDV^T , by  A^+ = V(D+)U^T.
@sonney2k	(fromt he code)
@sonney2k	what blackburn said
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	I had some article on pseudoinverse
 blackburn	sonney2k: what have I said?
@sonney2k	blackburn, seen that http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/GitHub-security-incident-highlights-Ruby-on-Rails-problem-1463207.html ?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: in any case I think that the whole point of computing the covariance and its inverse in QDA is to compute the Mahalanobis distance
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so I thought that maybe we could just use MahalanobisDistance for that
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah crazy
@sonney2k	blackburn, on #gsoc I had a chat with carol smith (gsoc organizer) and indeed the tutorial task seems to be out of scope for gsoc
 blackburn	sonney2k: damn..
@sonney2k	I asked her if we can rescue this part somehow, i.e. by modifying it to only have code parts in there like: write/polish examples, enable test suite based on these examples, fix code to have fewer ASSERT's etc
@sonney2k	lets see if that is possible
 n4nd0	ups ... not good

 blackburn	sonney2k: still there?
 blackburn	n4nd0: still there?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: I drank coffee :P
 blackburn	too much?
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha just a small cup, I am don't drink it usually so ...
 blackburn	n4nd0: if you find qda too messy we may come up with some other idea?
 n4nd0	n4nd0: I think it can be ok, I must learn to do new stuff so it is ok even if is a bit difficult to get it at the beginning
 n4nd0	blackburn: or do you say because you would like it to take it yourself?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, I don't want to for sure :)
 blackburn	I'm working on mc ocas this week probably ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, then I will continue with it
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have a couple of exams next week so I might work a bit slow but I won't leave it
 blackburn	I think I can suggest you to implement some dim reduction algorithm
 blackburn	no problem just keep in touch
 blackburn	so you won't have any exams in may or later?
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure, tell me about that dim reduction if you have thought of it already
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes I will :S
 blackburn	may be t-SNE
 n4nd0	I have to take a couple of exams from Spain in late April early
 n4nd0	May
 blackburn	I will have some in may as well
 blackburn	and bachelor's work defence (?)
 n4nd0	I did a bit of mess with my studies
 n4nd0	I came last year in Erasmus to KTH, in my 4th year of university
 n4nd0	in Spain the studies are normally 5 years long so I had still one year left after my Erasmus
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	but I got the opportunity of staying for a master at KTH ... and I didn't want to refuse it
 n4nd0	so here I am, doing the master and taking courses from my degree in Spain
 blackburn	so you are a msc student?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	but I don't have a real bachelor
 blackburn	I did not get even bachelor yet ;)
 n4nd0	in Spain it is 5 years so it is like if we get bachelor + msc when we graduate
 blackburn	so you are probably older than me :)
 n4nd0	I say it is like because from my point of view it is not like that
 n4nd0	I am 22
 blackburn	yeah, I'm 20 currently ;)
 n4nd0	I am from November 1989
 n4nd0	you go pretty well actually
 blackburn	btw we have had similar system for a while
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	about 5 year
 n4nd0	I don't like ... it sucks
 blackburn	but now we have bachelors too
 blackburn	and I'm going to be one of
 n4nd0	it if 5 years with really broad studies ... we don't really learn to do useful stuff of anything
 n4nd0	we learn a bit of everything and master nothing :(
 blackburn	is it better in swe?
 n4nd0	I like it more yes
 n4nd0	from my point of view in Spain the hard part is to pass the exams
 n4nd0	but the labs are really easy normally
 n4nd0	here the exams are quite ok, they test that you get the point of the course, basic exercises
 n4nd0	but the labs require lot of work
 blackburn	I have two algos to suggest to implement to you
 n4nd0	tell me
 blackburn	maximum variance unfolding and t-SNE
 blackburn	first one is simple
 n4nd0	do you have a good reference in a paper or a book for them?
 blackburn	n4nd0: in fact we would even create some idea for dimensionality reduction..
 blackburn	matlab code is provided in the matlab dimensionality reduction toolbox
 blackburn	and some paper may be
 blackburn	hmm I need to talk with soeren :)
 blackburn	I guess it can be an idea and I could help smb with mentoring
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: broad choice for you :)

 blackburn	uhuhuh
 blackburn	4.09 already and I have to be on my job on 10.00 damnation!
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I think you should get some sleep
 blackburn	agree
 blackburn	cronor: sorry is it your pull req?
 blackburn	if so - we need some time for this issue :)
 cronor	blackburn: huh?
 blackburn	cronor: then not your :)
 cronor	blackburn: probably yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay see you
 n4nd0	blackburn: good night

 n4nd0	sonne|work: ups sorry for that typo :(
 n4nd0	sonne|work: one question about QDA, where does it make more sense in the class hierarchy?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no that was my typo!
 sonne|work	no need to be sorry for the mistakes I make
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ah ok! :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think it should go directly under CMachine
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I have not seen other quadratic classifiers in the toolbox
 sonne|work	indeed ...
 n4nd0	so it is ok doing CQDA directly under CMachine or something in between like CQuadraticMachine analogous to CLinearMachine?
 sonne|work	just do it directly for now
 sonne|work	as long as we don't have any other quadratic machine it doesn't make sense to be overly general
 n4nd0	I see, ok then :)

 vikram360	What is the Software Engineering approach that Shogun developers usually tend to take when building a new feature into shogun? Is a prototype first built, tested and then integrated
 vikram360	Is there any strict methodology that all developers have to follow when building a feature

@sonney2k	vikram360, really depends - you could write an external class + some main method and just link to libshogun from c++ side and then when you feel comfortable submit your extension to core shogun providing some examples and interface integration - since we  use these examples also as regression tests everything will be fine then.
