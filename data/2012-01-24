 blackburn	sonney2k: will you sign against elsevier? :)
 blackburn	I would protest about every non-free shit if I was a scientist hah

@sonney2k	blackburn, I thoroughly hate all this non-open access crap
 blackburn	wow you are here
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	Nowadays I consider it good policy to not review nor publish for / in such journals
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but will go to bed soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: I did not commited any idea yet sorry
@sonney2k	blackburn, did gsoc 2012 already get announced?
 blackburn	no no
 blackburn	not yet
@sonney2k	I was working on the debian packages (the last days...)
 blackburn	for shogun?
@sonney2k	uploaded like 4 revisions...
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	weird errors / warnings with clang...
@sonney2k	https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: is there any way to automatize it??
@sonney2k	I don't understand why it fails on powerpc.
@sonney2k	blackburn, well we could have a buildbot building nightly debian packages for debian unstable
 blackburn	we could or we can?
@sonney2k	but that will usually fail due to whatever stuff is broken in debian unstable :)
@sonney2k	it is a matter of typing one command on the cmdline but still work
 blackburn	sonney2k: did I told you accuracy on these road signs?
@sonney2k	blackburn, at some point yes but no idea where you are now
 blackburn	well stucked on 96%
@sonney2k	did you already use virtual images?
 blackburn	no, not really
 blackburn	I don't really want to use it
@sonney2k	like slight rotation / translation
@sonney2k	that will improve another few percent
 blackburn	I'm trying to find a way to localize images a little
 blackburn	there is a bad background
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding GSoC
 blackburn	my descriptor is gradient based so I need to clean up images
@sonney2k	I think we should change the old website quite a bit
 blackburn	yeah we def. should
@sonney2k	I mean I would want to have very clear focus
@sonney2k	not thousands of ideas like last time
 blackburn	I would want to work on two things
 blackburn	+ 10 more dim reduction algos
 blackburn	or ECOC stuff
 blackburn	well I will have much time so I guess actually I will work on everything
@sonney2k	What I could imagine is: a) structured output learning b) multiclass learning c) input / output stuff d) cross-validation e) merging of SVM solvers f) opencv integration ...
@sonney2k	it sounded like chris wants to mentor domain adaptation algorithms, we might have a mentor for gaussian processes too
 blackburn	what the f is domain adaptation?
@sonney2k	learn on data A but apply the method to dataset B (which has a slighly different statistics - so adjust for that)
 blackburn	well I would be interested too
 blackburn	hahh
@sonney2k	we have stuff like this already in there
@sonney2k	blackburn, this year is much easier for shogun
@sonney2k	we have buildbots and a better structure
 blackburn	yes, much better
@sonney2k	so all these things are just more or less minor extensions
@sonney2k	that all integrate rather well
 blackburn	and at least I will help you much ;)
@sonney2k	I guess our chances to get in are not so bad given that chris di bona liked my summary :)
 blackburn	hah yes, we had some fame
@sonney2k	I wish we would find someone to do a) structured output learning b) multiclass stuff (I am particularly interested in this - the nips ecoc/tree paper sounded fast + accurate)
 blackburn	my gf bachelors thesis would be about ecoc hah
 blackburn	work/thesis/no idea how to call it properly
@sonney2k	I also would wish cross validation could get some syntactic sugar and more wide use
@sonney2k	I hope Vojtech will mentor again this year
 blackburn	what would he mentor?
@sonney2k	he could really help to get all these SVM solvers in
@sonney2k	he is the ueberexpert there
 blackburn	in SVM solvers?
@sonney2k	yes - he is the author of Ocas / GMNPSVM, ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I still feel unhappiness mixed with depression when looking into svm folder
@sonney2k	that won't change. way to difficult/time consuming  to rewrite these things
 blackburn	I hope I would see any progress in my life hahah
 CIA-10	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r210ae0a / (4 files in 3 dirs): fix various errors/warnings occurring with clang - http://git.io/OMcgNg
@sonney2k	ahh btw, some nice tutorial would be a *great* task too
 blackburn	I hope 40 more years would be enough
@sonney2k	so applications etc
 blackburn	I believe student can't write nice tutorial..
@sonney2k	why not?
 blackburn	if it wasn't phd student = expert in machine learning
@sonney2k	task could be to define some nice data set based on mentor input
@sonney2k	then run all alogirhtms
@sonney2k	algorithms on that
@sonney2k	with nice images
 blackburn	well only if he was really educated in ml
@sonney2k	and write text + formulas that he can find in the code / papers
@sonney2k	last year we had such ML experts
 blackburn	who?
@sonney2k	we didn't accept them
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	PhD students...
@sonney2k	not sure how many students we can mentor this year
@sonney2k	probably around 5 again - not more
@sonney2k	less is better if we find really good ones
@sonney2k	of your type btw :)
 blackburn	hah thanks
* blackburn is playing with opencv
@sonney2k	btw parallelization is also sth
@sonney2k	but I guess should be done by me
@sonney2k	not a student
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, parallelization should not be done by student
 blackburn	he would stuck and etc
@sonney2k	yeah, btw boosting algos are still missing from shogun
@sonney2k	I would love to have some of these too
 blackburn	and I consider doing vectorization not parallelization..
 blackburn	but I still have no machine with good graphics
 blackburn	don't really want to buy new one for that :D
@sonney2k	I am not a big fan of this GPU stuff yet
@sonney2k	just have no applications where GPUs really could help
 blackburn	sonney2k: well my stuff would run much faster with gpus..
@sonney2k	ok I think we have a much better picture now what we could do
@sonney2k	so it is easy to write something up
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah you have some quadratic/cubic algorithms in there
@sonney2k	that certainly helps
@sonney2k	and all nicely gpu-parallelizable
 blackburn	sonney2k: let multiclass stuff be done by me in feb-apr
 blackburn	I would need it anyway
@sonney2k	multiclass stuff involvement can start with simple stuff but can be arbitrarily tough
@sonney2k	so a student could as well do the harder stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: well I really need it so I'll try to get it done even in feb
 blackburn	including NIPS things
 blackburn	I'm pretty scaried with it but I hope to get through hah
@sonney2k	hehe
 blackburn	sonney2k: for me would be nice to work with chris, we could write one more article :D
@sonney2k	looking forward to this code - I will probably be your first user
@sonney2k	there are some ecoc libraries around already though
 blackburn	yes I am aware of it
@sonney2k	http://mloss.org/software/view/238/
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was thinking about generic ensembles and generic multiclass machines
@sonney2k	that will involve quite some refactoring
 blackburn	it should be done really *generic*
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	we have general OVO / OVR in MulticlassSVM
@sonney2k	at least for classify
@sonney2k	so one could probably get rid of LibSVMMultiClass or so
 blackburn	no, I mean something like constructing trees manually
@sonney2k	for training (which just does OVO)
 blackburn	ecocs, etc
 blackburn	and not only svm
@sonney2k	blackburn, the code is not just for SVM
@sonney2k	it is only encapsulated in MulticlassSVM
 blackburn	sonney2k: one more idea!
 blackburn	regressors
 blackburn	a lot of
@sonney2k	just because we had no multiclassmachine
@sonney2k	true
@sonney2k	linear regression is totally missing
@sonney2k	and these are quite some low hanging fruits
 blackburn	but I believe we should be 'minimized'
 blackburn	we should not implement everything..
 blackburn	mahalanobis distance could be gsoc-entering task hah
