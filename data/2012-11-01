 blackburn	n4nd0: hey you were writing to my webirc client at job - but I wasn't at job :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: oops :P
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you even have the slightest idea what ptizoom is talking about?
 blackburn	n4nd0: well my mistake to not close it
 blackburn	sonney2k: NO~
 blackburn	!!!
 blackburn	0%
 blackburn	nothing
 blackburn	??????
@sonney2k	net
@sonney2k	exactly
 n4nd0	nada
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	n4nd0: mas que nada!
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	alright, let me continue the gsoc billing
@sonney2k	*urgs*
 blackburn	sonney2k: big boss counting money?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no news from carol?
@sonney2k	blackburn, is it one week yet?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah counting money but heiko will receive it :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: one day more and yes I guess :)
@sonney2k	well sorting bills lets say
@sonney2k	even worse
 ptizoom	oye, ptizoom, was doing metaphors and poetry, as sure as cosacks can ride...killing time on ics. but anyway forget it...
 sonne|work	ptizoom: we appreciate some daily poem from ptizoom on shogun planet :D

 ptizoom	I was also praising in the dojo of ML.
 ptizoom	anyway enough unflattering flaf...I still do not understand why ...
 ptizoom	*** Testing in ../data/classifier/*.m
 ptizoom	../data/classifier/LibLinear_0017_1en05_1_True.m                ERROR
 ptizoom	LibLinear - yesclassified: 5.644953e-02, bias: 9.286755e-04 <--- accuracy: 1.000000e-04
 ptizoom	sonne*: shall this test be spot on, below accuracy .0001 ?
 blackburn	exactly
 ptizoom	so my perl stuff is very dodgy indeed...
 blackburn	ptizoom: but it is .m? how perl?
 ptizoom	I checked memory with debugger of vectorisation and matrification in/out and it shall be ok, but ... there must be a miss match in the engine...
 sonne|work	blackburn: man thats the test
 blackburn	sonne|work: matlab/octave test right?
 sonne|work	blackburn: no
 ptizoom	blackburn... yes
 ptizoom	oops
 blackburn	sonne|work: it tests perl?
 sonne|work	blackburn: this is just some file with the output
 blackburn	hmm okay
 ptizoom	there
 sonne|work	ptizoom: it suggests that sth is wrong with vector/matrix typemaps
 sonne|work	ptizoom: check if sth basic like the gaussian kernel works
 ptizoom	I was slowly but surely perlifying the tests in /tests/unit...
 ptizoom	that would tell me where are the deficiencies in the swig perlmodular...
 ptizoom	but hey, thanks for the tip.
 ptizoom	for info, not a single .m test works within accuracy ...
 ptizoom	ho gobble...
 sonne|work	ptizoom: well do sth very simple
 sonne|work	create some matrix
 sonne|work	from that x=RealFeatures(matrix)
 sonne|work	and then x.get_feature_matrix() (or what it is called)
 sonne|work	and compare if results match
 sonne|work	if that works do k=GaussianKernel(x,x)
 sonne|work	k.get_kernel_matrix()
 ptizoom	noted, I will come to that. thanks
 sonne|work	you can compare the result w/ what you get on python_modular
 ptizoom	I know... but that would be to easy, that would be cheating!

 Arya	Hi,I'm getting assertion failed when trying to read binary machines for multiclass classification. the line is : "CSVM *the_svm = (CSVM *)svm->get_machine(i);" which the_svm is Null
 blackburn	Arya: hi
 blackburn	Arya: how did you learn that "svm"?
 blackburn	what is the type?
 blackburn	Arya: my first guess is that binary machine could be of CLinearMachine class
 Arya	yes libsvmm , I'm running the classifier_multiclasslibsvm.cpp example on my dataset
 Arya	when the code reaches svm->apply() it happens
 blackburn	should be a bug when
 blackburn	Arya: my other guess is that could happen if you have more classes in test data than in train data
 Arya	no, I test it on train data, but the same happens
 blackburn	Arya: can you please check number of machines after training? method 'get_num_machines'
 Arya	it's correct, n(n-1)/2
 Arya	int mc_libsvm(const char* ds, float64_t c, float64_t width, int32_t split) { init_shogun_with_defaults(); std::stringstream path; path<< "/home/arya/datasets/"<<ds << ".libsvm.train."<<split;  uint32_t n=0,d=0; std::string train_file=path.str(); const char* train_file_name=train_file.c_str(); get_size(train_file, &n, &d); SGMatrix<float64_t> X(d,n); SGVector<float64_t> y(n);  read_data(train_file_name, X, y); CLabels* train_
 Arya	ooops
 Arya	can I send you my function?
 blackburn	Arya: pastebin maybe
 blackburn	or mail me blackburn91 at gmail.com
 blackburn	Arya: gtg now - please email me I'll take a look

@sonney2k	blackburn, any clues on the bug?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: which bug?
 blackburn	ahhh
 blackburn	solved
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha I see in the news Oksana is getting into shogun
 n4nd0	well done! :)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	well I've spent a while trying to understand the error and she helped
 blackburn	so credit goes to
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is the  SG_PRINT("Num classes = %d\n",num_classes); in your patch?
 blackburn	sonney2k: oops juk
 blackburn	junk
 blackburn	here you go

 blackburn	n4nd0: # vectors10000
 blackburn	Covertree construction took 7.880000 seconds
 blackburn	Covertree-based neighbors search took 21.230000 seconds
 n4nd0	blackburn: what about the na?ve strategy?
 n4nd0	what is the speedup with covertree wrt it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: partial_sort?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, the other one that was at the beginning
 blackburn	much slower I bet
 blackburn	n4nd0: before it was 14.94s for 10000
 blackburn	23s now
 blackburn	so a room for improvement still :D
 n4nd0	so, that covertree is slower?
 blackburn	n4nd0: probably
 blackburn	JL is faster but it you are the only guy that managed to get it working
 n4nd0	I still don't understand how is it possible that it can be slower than sorting!
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is impossible :D
 n4nd0	but it is like that, isn't it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: ??
 n4nd0	that covertree is slower than na?ve sorting
 blackburn	which?
 n4nd0	the one you are testing
 n4nd0	you pasted ^
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	you misunderstood me
 n4nd0	oh I see, sorry
 blackburn	it was a covertree as well

 n4nd0	you know logs in
 n4nd0	blame some people and go away
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, hurray - I finished the billing stuff :)
@sonney2k	Just submitted to google
@sonney2k	lets hope it works...
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is it? what you had to do?
@sonney2k	blackburn, collect bills write some itemized billing and submit
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	we just steal money here and stash it under a pillow
@sonney2k	yeah I guess that is what you do in rossia
@sonney2k	wiking, any ideas about https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/785
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know whether wiking is busy with some paper or sth?
 blackburn	sonney2k: he should be probably yes
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	hungry
@sonney2k	I need to have a second dinner
 blackburn	are you growing up?
@sonney2k	not volume wise - but yes I guess doing the bills did cost a lot of energy ;)
@sonney2k	yay pizza is waiting for me :)
@sonney2k	yummy yummy yummy
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	damn it, that made me hungry
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just join me
* sonney2k hands over a slice of pizza to n4nd0 
 n4nd0	sonney2k: danke
@sonney2k	n4nd0, how is it going?
 blackburn	haha superfriendly sonney2k now
* sonney2k hands another slice to blackburn 
 n4nd0	sonney2k: good, what about you?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, long time no code contributions? I guess you are pretty busy currently...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am just glad that I managed to write this blogpost somehow
@sonney2k	I suck at blogging
 blackburn	sonney2k: I employed him
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	my scout reached him by email
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I am trying to put KNN into the EDRT
 blackburn	you know I have scout team
 n4nd0	hopefully I will have something ready by tom night
@sonney2k	I see, you hijacked him
 blackburn	sonney2k: you have JMLR pubs we don't
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, does it make me feel better in any way?
 blackburn	sonney2k: you are the only who knows
@sonney2k	then guess what the answer is
 blackburn	we are young and want to try various dangerous things haha
 n4nd0	hehe good answer for a good question I think
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I want to put the word recognizer application inside though
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that would be cool
 n4nd0	I think I will go a little bit slow with it but I'll do it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could we make this some live thing?
 blackburn	sonney2k: come on, all the EDRT stuff will be included to shogun anyway
@sonney2k	blackburn, I always wanted to have KNN :P
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is already in shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, I know :) I wrote it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have done a live one that worked fine but the problem is the data
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean with covertree not sort
 n4nd0	the one I did worked fine with my and bernard's voices
 n4nd0	but it will probably explode with other's
 blackburn	sonney2k: NNs is a bottleneck for me so I hired a best specialist in JL's covertree around :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, s/hired/hijacked :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well then we need more people :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k : http://bernard.260mb.org/
 n4nd0	open speech recognition
@sonney2k	n4nd0, speaking of bernard - is he doing fine?
@sonney2k	since he wrote the website he basically disappeared
 blackburn	n4nd0: impressive CV I'd hire him too
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, he is
 n4nd0	sonney2k: we are doing together a CV course now and he is starting to look for a company where to do his master thesis
 blackburn	OMFG I have to do people detector
 blackburn	good you did remind me;
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ehm sleep reduction technique anyone?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we are trying to do some live demos on the website with shogun as backend and django & d3js etc as frontend. maybe he would be interested in playing with this?
 blackburn	yeah we will consult him with hyperplanes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I'll ask him right now
 blackburn	n4nd0: is he your flatmate? :D
 n4nd0	not really
@sonney2k	n4nd0, basically stuff like we have in the graphical examples + e.g. the ocr demo
@sonney2k	but face recognition would be even cooler :D
@sonney2k	+ gender detection
@sonney2k	but quite some effort
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he said he is sorry but no :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: haha I came up with very offensive app
@sonney2k	n4nd0, too bad.
 n4nd0	sonney2k: face detection would be awesome but we need adaboost for that!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no
 blackburn	so you enter the website it takes image from your camera
 n4nd0	that reminds me when I started to come around here, adaboost
 blackburn	and says you are a man
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I would rather just use opencv's FD
@sonney2k	it works OKish
@sonney2k	and on top of it we put the gender classifier
 blackburn	opencv is a heap of api crap
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	who cares
@sonney2k	it does the job :D
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	I know they use Haar features
 n4nd0	is it with adaboost too?
 blackburn	it has god damn WORST HOG thing ever
 blackburn	they should rather call it humandetectorarraycomparator :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, some cascades - decision trees maybe?
@sonney2k	(wildly guessing)
 n4nd0	maybe a cascade of strong classifiers with adaboost
 n4nd0	that's what we did in our course actually
@sonney2k	no boosting I think
 blackburn	n4nd0: why do you think adaboost is so required here?
@sonney2k	blackburn, it really is very well suited for that task
 blackburn	for haar yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: http://books.google.se/books?id=seAgiOfu2EIC&pg=PA508&lpg=PA508&dq=opencv+face+detector+adaboost&source=bl&ots=hSI1dfiGNi&sig=YblAMxB_D1hv5cYSbZoTLS7dtD8&hl=sv&sa=X&ei=l_KSUKakB5DNswb9w4GABg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=opencv%20face%20detector%20adaboost&f=false
@sonney2k	and other object recognition
 n4nd0	sorry for that ugly link...
 n4nd0	but it looks like it is adaboost
 n4nd0	Viola-Jones
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think it is a pretty awesome algorithm
 blackburn	n4nd0: dependsssssss
 n4nd0	blackburn: and also, it is the only thing I have done for face detection :D idk if there are other strategies
 blackburn	even LBP + linear svm works
 blackburn	with HKM even better I think
@sonney2k	indeed http://www.cognotics.com/opencv/servo_2007_series/part_2/sidebar.html
@sonney2k	blackburn, but your traffic sign stuff would also be very cool
 n4nd0	that link was definitely nicer :S
@sonney2k	blackburn, it would actually be very easy to put it on the website once you put the thing into /applications
 blackburn	sonney2k: draw me how do you see it
@sonney2k	blackburn, just some image upload button -> name or what do you mean?
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: [BENCHMARK] Randomized eigendecomposition took 0.57 seconds
 blackburn	sonney2k: n4nd0: 15K x 15K eigenproblem
 blackburn	result is a little approximate though but come on it is linear
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am a good composer of stolen methods :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, its an art!
@sonney2k	stealing is believing :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/objdetect/cascade_classifier/cascade_classifier.html
@sonney2k	looks like they have one based on LBP
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes they do
@sonney2k	probably better these days
 blackburn	LBP is as well good for faces
 blackburn	HOG+LBP is unbeatable :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, don't tell that yann lecun :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: well I respect his vision that we should learn features not models
@sonney2k	alright I guess when I find the time I will do some shogun demoing
@sonney2k	but for now
@sonney2k	bed time
@sonney2k	cya
 n4nd0	night
 n4nd0	time to sleep here too, good night
 blackburn	n4nd0: night
