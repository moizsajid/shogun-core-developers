@HeikoS	got an all fancy new cms of my site
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh cool
@HeikoS	now can put up drafts to get feedback before I publish
@HeikoS	design is not yet completely done, it will look prettier
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: your work?
@lisitsyn	ahh its wordpress ;)
@HeikoS	the page or the article ;)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	But I installed it myself
@lisitsyn	I thought you made brand new thing ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: did you glance over my notes?
@lisitsyn	I am not sure if they are useful or just small details
@lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	I did read them
@HeikoS	I think I will take most of them actually
@HeikoS	in next revision
@HeikoS	Ill wait for ICML reviews to come in before I touch it
@HeikoS	otherwise I have to touch it again ;)
@lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	Im workig on somethign else also that currently needs my attention
@HeikoS	I hope to get it to a good state before I have to dive into debiasing again
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I wanted to know how can I use that for my stuff
@lisitsyn	didn't realize how :)
@HeikoS	what do you want to do?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah the pca thing right?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: for example
@lisitsyn	;)
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I work with some data and so on
@HeikoS	this thing allows you to trade off sub-sampling bias against increased variance
@HeikoS	if you have an estimator that uses all data
@HeikoS	you can get the same answer with this debiasing, without using all data
@HeikoS	but only subsets
@HeikoS	depending on how much redundancy is in the data
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah but the procedure is not really clear for me
@lisitsyn	what subsets should I take etc
@HeikoS	random is ok
@HeikoS	and always double their size
@HeikoS	then compute your method on them
@HeikoS	store result
@HeikoS	and then average using the telescoping sum estimator
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so its pretty generic, right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but it only works in presence of redundancy
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I guess for PCA one should start with number of dimensions
@HeikoS	question in PCA is what you estimate
@HeikoS	but yeah one could imagine estimating principal component
@HeikoS	actually, thats a cool experiment to do
@lisitsyn	I though of projection error
@lisitsyn	thought*
@HeikoS	not sure how to cast that as an estimation problem over subsets of the data
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ahh I got it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it should be done other way I guess
@lisitsyn	one should estimate telescoping for covariance matrix
@lisitsyn	right?
@HeikoS	no rather for say largest eigenvalue
@HeikoS	of covriance
@HeikoS	of top rank PC
@lisitsyn	hmm is it robust?
@HeikoS	I dont know
@HeikoS	would have to try this as an experiment
@HeikoS	I think I will try this
@lisitsyn	what about ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest one?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I got to show you a pic
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: check gmail
@HeikoS	I have this open but where to look?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: sent you direct message
@HeikoS	video?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm no it is a picture
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: didn't it arrive?

@HeikoS	I got this giant album thing via google talk
@HeikoS	but no mail
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: album thing?
@HeikoS	I did not get anemail
@HeikoS	resend
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no mail, direct message
@lisitsyn	via hangouts
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	got that
@lisitsyn	there is a cloud of pics
@lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	what is it
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	that's one thing I got recently
@lisitsyn	some features for various things like watches, bikes
@lisitsyn	similar things come together here :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: can you see structure? :)
@HeikoS	yeah, cool
@HeikoS	what is that?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: my job
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: or you mean anything else?
@HeikoS	that what you do?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: Ill go to bed now
@HeikoS	good night
