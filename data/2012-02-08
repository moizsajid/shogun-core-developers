 wiking	mm i'm trying to use java modular of shogun, but somehow i just cannot load modshogun from system library.. the shogun.jar is in classpath for sure
 blackburn	what is the error?
 blackburn	not only classpath but ld_library_path should be set
 wiking	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no modshogun in java.library.path
 wiking	i thought mod shogun is included in the jar
 blackburn	exactly what I said
 blackburn	no, jar is only for interface classes
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	shouldn't it be then rather -Djava.library.path= ...
 wiking	?
 blackburn	I've never tried last one but it could work as well
 wiking	is it looking for libmodshogun.so ?
 blackburn	sure
 wiking	mmm
 blackburn	export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/jblas.jar:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular/shogun.jar:.
 blackburn	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=SHOGUNDIR/src/libshogun:SHOGUNDIR/src/java_modular
 blackburn	paste from tutorial
 blackburn	err installation notes
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	great worked... a bit different way but it's all good thnx a lot!
 blackburn	you're welcome

 n4nd0	hi
 n4nd0	I have just installed shogun from the source code but it seems that I have done sth wrong with the data files
 n4nd0	the examples just don't run because they files under data/ are not there
 n4nd0	is it required to do sth special to have them?
