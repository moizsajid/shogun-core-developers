 blackburn	uh I fell asleep before :D
 sonne|work	we should really add ignores
 sonne|work	as much as possible
 sonne|work	err morning blackburn
 blackburn	morning
 blackburn	sonne|work: ignores for what?
 sonne|work	unused stuff / non-useful stuff
 sonne|work	like free_feature_*
 blackburn	hmm sure
 sonne|work	I already started but I guess there are like 1000 times more

 CIA-33	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rafa4852 / (4 files): add option to get corresponding bias-thresholds together with PRC / ROC curve - http://git.io/VdnLFQ

 CIA-33	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r646ff20 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/evaluation_thresholds_modular.py : add example for thresholds - http://git.io/OYmhYw
 blackburn	sonney2k: what a trick: [fp,tp]=evaluator.get_ROC()

 blackburn	sonne|work: our paper with Chris is on the way to be finished in max 2 weeks I hope
 sonne|work	finally...
 blackburn	sonne|work: well I was really stucked with a lot of tasks
 blackburn	and now Chris helped to write some text
 blackburn	sonne|work: and recall I did a lot of programming things :)
 sonne|work	you mean you do a lot of things?
 blackburn	sonne|work: well.. there are a lot of code I have done?
 blackburn	and I have some pretty examples
 blackburn	later I will integrate some of them with dataset downloaders I guess
 sonne|work	data set downloaders?
 sonne|work	you mean contributions to shogun?
 sonne|work	I guess I still don't understand
 sonne|work	in any case I think we are going twice as fast as before with shogun development - but we need a new release ASAP now :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: my examples use data I can't integrate into shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: we've got strange misunderstanding :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I thought just after GSoC 'race' started shogun is on 10x faster development :)
 sonne|work	yeah but you/me were doing much more back then not to forget all the others :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw I added the threshold thing to evalutions
 sonne|work	one can now directly fetch the threshold needed to e.g. get a false positive rate of 1%
 sonne|work	very convenient
 blackburn	sonne|work: I do not understand how to use it but I have seen you did it
 sonne|work	just evaluator.get_thresholds()
 sonne|work	then you have for every tp/fp pair the coresponding threshold
 blackburn	sonne|work: what is threshold?
 sonne|work	the bias
 sonne|work	f(x)>threshold means predict +1
 sonne|work	-1 otherwise
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	you should tell me everything in that way while I am such a dumbass
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	I don't think you are
 blackburn	believe me :)
 sonne|work	trust me ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: are you still satisfied with java programming?
 sonne|work	for data analysis it is not very convenient - I am orders of magnitude faster in python
 sonne|work	but otherwise it is very convenient with eclipse at least
 blackburn	I'm thinking to change job in next year and choose one without java :D
 sonne|work	well at least no memory leaks - but I don't like ThisLongFunctionNamesHelpTotallyInUnderstandingWhatever
 blackburn	sonne|work: EE is way too crappy..
 blackburn	SQL + XML + Java code mixed up
 sonne|work	I am not that deep into these things
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am happy for you and you should be too :)
 blackburn	'jedem das seine' and I think I would like to do something different, like you do :)
 blackburn	hmm btw is it a negative phrase for you?
 blackburn	oh! it's time to go to gym again
 blackburn	see you

 shogun-buildbot	build #70 of nightly_all is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_all/builds/70
 shogun-buildbot	build #343 of octave_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/343  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	sonney2k: how significantly did it speedup compilation?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not significantly but it will remove potentially dangerous/unneeded functions
 blackburn	sure, I started these things before
@sonney2k	feel free to continue
 blackburn	I don't mind if I was jobless :D
 blackburn	I have pretty hard next two days..
@sonney2k	blackburn, how can I get you fired ;-)
 blackburn	sonney2k: well unfortunately I have no time not because of job
 blackburn	but because of studies
@sonney2k	then it is better to not fire you
@sonney2k	better do your homework
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no homework, i'm too old for that :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have one crazy semestral job on numerical methods in mathematical physics
 blackburn	that takes a lot of time but will be finished next week
