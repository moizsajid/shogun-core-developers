 ssapo	Saurabh7: I wanted to know about how IPython notebooks are rendered in showroom link of Shogun
 ssapo	Does it use Sphinx in some way?
 Hieronymous	ssapo: You can convert IPython notebooks to html.
 Hieronymous	That is what is there in the showroom.
 Hieronymous	https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/nbconvert.html
 ssapo	I do not wish to render them as HTML
 ssapo	I wish to render them just as an IPython notebook
 ssapo	Like If I click on Introduction Link in Showroom
 ssapo	An IPython notebook would show

 Hieronymous	"Render as IPython notebook" doesn't make sense.
 Hieronymous	If you want to view them - http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
 Hieronymous	You can download them as well from the repo, install IPython on your machine and view/edit them as ipynb.
 Hieronymous	Actually, you can view notebooks on GitHub, no need for nbviewer as well.

 Hieronymous	Hey, I was trying to Import Isomap in Python. But the isomap class that is imported doesn't have that method.
 Hieronymous	I checked dir(isomap), the method definitions for the object and the method I require isn't listed there.
 Hieronymous	*that method* - set_target_dim - here - http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/api/latest/classshogun_1_1CEmbeddingConverter.html#a626c39e21bb5842525ea02561084dc00
 Hieronymous	I'm trying the tapkee example given here - http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/notebook/latest/Tapkee.html
@wiking	Hieronymous, there might be some dependency you are missing
 Hieronymous	Well, I am able to import Isomap.
 Hieronymous	And a subset of its methods.
 Hieronymous	wiking: Also, I was able to import all the methods of StochasticProximityEmbedding
