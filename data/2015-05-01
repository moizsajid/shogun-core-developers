@wiking	besser82: yo
@besser82	wiking, here =)
@wiking	ok so about the packaging
@wiking	we have 2 packaging done for libshogun itself
@wiking	and one for python
@wiking	but bascially we need to fix a bit cmake
@wiking	so that we can actually build for example python-modular w/o building the actual c library
@wiking	once that is done we can roll out all the other packages finally
@wiking	any ideas for that?
@wiking	i have some time now
@wiking	so if u can just give me directions how to do that
@wiking	i'm happy to spend now some hours on that
@wiking	once that's done we can start adding daily builds
@wiking	to the bot :)
@besser82	i see...  doing that inside cmake isn't that trivial...
@wiking	yeah that's why it isn't done yet :)
@besser82	hehe...
@besser82	first we need to get rid of all those preprocessor defines on the command-line...
@besser82	and have them properly setup in a config.h && swig_config.i
@wiking	i started to create ShogunConfig.cmake.in and ShogunConfigVersion.cmake.in
@besser82	that's the next step
@wiking	ahh that i would put later :)))
@wiking	i mean the defines
@besser82	i can do the defines thing...
@besser82	have plenty of time today =)
@wiking	see the COMPFLAGS_CPP and LINKFLAGS in
@wiking	config.h atm
@wiking	that we could use
@wiking	but even ShogunConfig.cmake.in could contain those info or?
@besser82	that's even more complicated
@besser82	if we'd generate all that vars into ShogunConfig
@besser82	.cmake
@wiking	ah
@wiking	so you would just put every compiler flag into config.h?
@wiking	or not have any compiler flag
@wiking	have everything in config.h
@besser82	yes
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then actually ccache would start working properly ;)
@wiking	:P
@besser82	everything but swigflags and $ENV(CXXFLAGS)
@besser82	right  :P
@wiking	well that's almost there
@besser82	because it doesn't need to eval all the cli defines
@wiking	i mean we almost have everything redudant in config.h
@wiking	and -D
@besser82	that's fine...
@wiking	so we could just start get rid of DEFINES variable
@besser82	then I'll start doing the same for swig_config.i
@wiking	and somehow just port the compiler flags for swig
@besser82	yes
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so feature branch?
@wiking	and let's push things there?
@besser82	would be good...  I'll setup one, just a minute
@wiking	ok
@wiking	lemme know when i can pull
@wiking	then i should work on removing the c++ compiler flags?
@wiking	i mean from the libshogun and examples project?
@wiking	and unit tests...
@besser82	`feature/config.h`-branch is in sg-repo
@wiking	btw we are now having serious problem with csharp modular :)
@wiking	ok got it!
@besser82	we should coordinate work a bit, so we don't have "spaghetti" mergings, but ffwd history
@besser82	which problem with csharp?
@wiking	yep
@besser82	for me it works on fc22 && swig3
@wiking	well i think we'll need to fix some typemap things int he csharp
@wiking	what's your mono version?
@besser82	Mono JIT compiler version 2.10.8 (tarball Sat Jun  7 14:11:04 UTC 2014)
@besser82	Copyright (C) 2002-2011 Novell, Inc, Xamarin, Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com
@besser82	TLS:           __thread
@besser82	SIGSEGV:       altstack
@besser82	Notifications: epoll
@besser82	Architecture:  amd64
@besser82	Disabled:      none
@besser82	Misc:          debugger softdebug
@besser82	LLVM:          supported, not enabled.
@besser82	GC:            Included Boehm (with typed GC and Parallel Mark)
@besser82	wiking, ^
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	2.x
@wiking	thats why
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2642/steps/csharp%20modular/logs/stdio
@wiking	> 3.x is getting into troubles
@besser82	to get anything newer to work, we'd need to rewrite the csharp thing to swig3
@besser82	then we can cover all mono >= 2.X without trouble
@besser82	next thing is: we should stop generating any crap inside cmake_src_dir, but use cmake_bin_dir
@besser82	My long-term plan is: getting cmake refactored basically from scratch
@besser82	we so many kludges in there  :(
@besser82	have
@wiking	yeap
@wiking	but yeah lets do one at a time
@wiking	as we will never get from 1 to 2
@besser82	that's right

@besser82	wiking, like ripping out the cli defines
