 lisitsyn	HeikoS: back!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jojo
@HeikoS	had a nice holiday=?
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	nice one
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ready to get back to full speed shogun? haha
@HeikoS	did you climb the volcano?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I can give it a try
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	I was thinking about going excursion by bus
 lisitsyn	but I realized I want to climb it
 lisitsyn	like by foot
 lisitsyn	so later :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: have you been to loro parque?
 lisitsyn	visit it in december if not :)
@HeikoS	what is that?
@HeikoS	nope I have not
@HeikoS	just been on the olcano and then on hippie beaches
@HeikoS	with lots oif naked people haha
@HeikoS	saw my mail re modularisation and the ease of putting research code into shogun?
@HeikoS	man we have to move with that stuff ..... I stopped putting my own work in -- to much hassle. not good

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh you're back
 lisitsyn	I've seen your mail
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any thoughts?
 lisitsyn	but not read it thoroughly yet sorry
 lisitsyn	I got the idea
@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	oh why hello wiking
 lisitsyn	how are you
@HeikoS	wiking: hi!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okk
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am thinking of my old suggestion
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah me too
 lisitsyn	very limited api
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: user code (any language) <-> shogun api (not very rich and plugin-oriented) <-> plugins code (any language)
 lisitsyn	what about this?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
@HeikoS	one distinction I would like to add
@HeikoS	there should be some kind of 'core' shogun, providing all low level things needed to implement algorithms
@HeikoS	and then some base modules that come with shogun
 lisitsyn	handling scalars, strings, matrices
 lisitsyn	with serialization
@HeikoS	and if I want to use or develop new things, I never have to even look at the others
 lisitsyn	we should define basic concepts
 lisitsyn	kernels, features
 lisitsyn	they are ok
@HeikoS	meaning that if I want to implement a new density estimator, I dont need to compile/dependency meet/or whatever GP stuff
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that would be a big improvement
@HeikoS	and yes I agree
@HeikoS	basic data handling, serialisation,
@HeikoS	then feature representations and linear algebra, maybe computing framework
 lisitsyn	although I have a feeling its quite impossible to change the existing code
@HeikoS	and then plugins
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we can migrate
@HeikoS	using unit tests that is quite easy
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but what about a minimal proof of concept first
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	that actually works, coimpiles, installs, etc
@HeikoS	and then we port the code
@HeikoS	the algorithm code should not change too much so we are not at risk of loosing many things
@HeikoS	also, we can be dual for some point, i.e. have the old code still in, and then migrate things, just like with the static interfaces
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: another question:
@HeikoS	how does this conflict with the manual
@HeikoS	does it in fact?
@HeikoS	Might not
 lisitsyn	no, I don't see any reason to conflic
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats great
 lisitsyn	well our time?
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	haha
 lisitsyn	which is limited :(
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah manual has to go online first
@HeikoS	but then I think we could work on this
@HeikoS	minimal shogun core
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	shall we push the thing, its about to be done anyways
@HeikoS	I have a bit more time over the rest of the year
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we can schedule some time to work together
@HeikoS	so can work bits and pieces daily
@HeikoS	what about later today?
 lisitsyn	can't promise but if I get some time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you remember what we needed to do next=?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what about the automatic linking of Shogun classes?
 lisitsyn	manual?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  yes
 lisitsyn	vaguely
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am not sure about shogun classes
 lisitsyn	if we go modular we won't have that :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: mmh
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: why not?
 lisitsyn	but still we gonna have some base classes
@HeikoS	all modules just generate their own doxygen page?
@HeikoS	not possible?
@HeikoS	maybe we need to re-think the doxygen then
 lisitsyn	well
@HeikoS	but for now, lets keep it in
 lisitsyn	I am considering your case
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sure, but we still would have a build with all modules active right?
 lisitsyn	yes but some modules are not published in shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah true
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I think maybe drafting the structure a bit would be good
@HeikoS	to know whats within shogun and which layer it sits in
 lisitsyn	yeah
@HeikoS	I have to leave now, but happy to discuss later
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: lets finish the manual thing first without thinking too much about the modularisation, just to get started and also it will be progress already
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	good
@HeikoS	manual backend can be changed later, the process of writing these pages will be the same
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: catch up later, I ll say hello again in a bit
