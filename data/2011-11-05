 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
 blackburn	sonney2k: my issue with thread unsafety was related to thread-unsafe DLAMCH routine, which determines machine eps
 blackburn	it is fucking awful - the whole LAPACK is thread-safe but DLAMCH

 shogun-buildbot	build #312 of octave_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/312
@sonney2k	blackburn1, it is a bit surprising - thought that lapack is 100% thread safe...
@sonney2k	a bit weird for a lib of this kind
 blackburn1	sonney2k: 3.3 is so, but 3.2.1's dlamch is not
@sonney2k	blackburn1, well then add a test for that version and force unicore if <3.3
 blackburn1	sonney2k: how can i test lapack version in runtime?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, compile time - not runtime
 blackburn1	ehh okay
@sonney2k	blackburn1, but maybe the even have a api function for checking the version?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I don't know it yet
@sonney2k	no idea - check the source :)
@sonney2k	blackburn1, have you read Madeleines question on the mailinglist?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes, but I'm afraid I can't help she
 blackburn1	sonney2k: don't you think alessandro is a bit offensive? :D
@sonney2k	blackburn1, no why?
@sonney2k	he is right
@sonney2k	if it doesn't work w/o jblas then it doesn't make sense to just print a warning
@sonney2k	and one should fail instead
@sonney2k	blackburn1, do we have MeanAbsoluteError?
@sonney2k	in evaluation I mean?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: mean squared error
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I'm about his writing style :)
@sonney2k	but that cannot do absoute right?
@sonney2k	I just started writing it...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what is the difference?
@sonney2k	one is ||.||^2
@sonney2k	one ||.||
@sonney2k	| |
 blackburn1	sonney2k: does it have some 'fundamental' difference?
@sonney2k	fundamental?
@sonney2k	it will punish differences close to zero much more
 blackburn1	eh nevermind, bad word
 blackburn1	ah I see
 blackburn1	sonney2k: you could meansquarederror -> meanerror
 blackburn1	and add options to square or not
 blackburn1	sonney2k: about madeleine question - I really do not understand much about her problem, it is related to things you are better with than me
@sonney2k	blackburn1, ok implemented that mean absolute error thing
 blackburn1	http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.3.0.html
 blackburn1	sonney2k: Thread safe xLAMCH: SLAMCH and DLAMCH were the only two routines not thread-safe in LAPACK-3.2. This is fixed: all routines in LAPACK-3.3 are now thread-safe.
 blackburn1	it is really awful
 blackburn1	sonney2k: could you please describe how to link shogun with my own lapack instead of atlas' one&
 blackburn1	?
 blackburn1	I spent too much time on it, decided to ask you instead
@sonney2k	your own lapack?
 blackburn1	hah
@sonney2k	just set the library / include paths on configure?
 blackburn1	again bad wording
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes a did a try
 blackburn1	but it links with atlas' one :(
 blackburn1	I did*
 blackburn1	I'll make a try again
 blackburn1	sonney2k: today I've tested kernel ltsa on 84x112 pictures
 blackburn1	it was 80s faster than original LTSA with the same results
 blackburn1	80x*
 blackburn1	in fact I started writing a paper, what do you think, does this kind of algo extension worths to be published in any journal?
 blackburn1	I'm a total newbie in science affairs hah
@sonney2k	blackburn1, if the extension is not trivial and ltsa is some established algo - sure
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what is the trivial extension?
 CIA-37	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r857311c / (4 files in 2 dirs): introduce MeanAbsoluteError - http://git.io/H8jXVw
@sonney2k	blackburn1, something obvious for experts
@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw look at the copyright line in the above ^ commit
 blackburn1	sonney2k: can I consider you as expert? hehe
 blackburn1	why me?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, no - I don't know anything about LTSA
@sonney2k	blackburn1, I used your MSE code
 blackburn1	sonney2k: do you know anything about SVD and kernel matrix?
@sonney2k	kernel matrix? no clue what that could be
 blackburn1	matrix of pairwise kernels?
 blackburn1	k11 k12 k13 ...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: in the ltsa algorithm there are right singular vectors of centered feature matrix [X-[mean feature vector]] are being computed
 blackburn1	I proved that it is the same to find eigenvectors of centered gram matrix
 blackburn1	=> faster, makes possible to use kernels
 blackburn1	sonney2k: it is obvious for me, but I don't know if it is for anyone else
 blackburn1	sonney2k: do not leave me alone when I'm ask stupid Qs :D
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-160-249-224.range86-160.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
 heiko	sonney2k, just read the mails regarding the modsel problem, will try to figure our what is going on now.
 blackburn1	howdy!
 blackburn1	saturday night fixing model selection show
 heiko	hi blackburn
 heiko	hehe, well just read the mail
 heiko	and i just got a minute
 heiko	very busy the rest of the time
 heiko	everything ok in russia? :)
 blackburn1	heiko: sure, we are vodka-enough
 heiko	hehe :)
 heiko	what about your studies, everything going well?
 blackburn1	heiko: oh studies are going ok, though I have a little spare time because I started working at netcracker
 heiko	netcracker?
 blackburn1	heiko: yeah, http://netcracker.com/en/
 heiko	ah ok, new job
 heiko	cool
 heiko	is it nice?
 blackburn1	heiko: it would be better to say first job :)
 blackburn1	not very nice but 2 pros: a) I'm paid b) I work part-time :)
 heiko	ok :)
 blackburn1	heiko: what about you? what do you do?
 heiko	I am started with a master in machine learning in london
 heiko	http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/courses/msc_ml/
 heiko	really cool
 heiko	but consumes all of my time
 blackburn1	heiko: so sad you can't do shoguning :)
 heiko	yes, indeed
 heiko	but thigns will change
 heiko	but for the moment it is like it is
 heiko	think i will have some free time around january
 heiko	and then in march
 heiko	and then in the summer also
 blackburn1	I guess we will never have much free time as we had in summer
 heiko	yes i think so
 heiko	btw current head does not compile here
 blackburn1	heiko: error?
 heiko	In file included from base/class_list.cpp:66:0:
 heiko	./kernel/MultitaskKernelMaskPairNormalizer.h: In member function 'virtual bool shogun::CMultitaskKernelMaskPairNormalizer::init(shogun::CKernel*)':
 heiko	./kernel/MultitaskKernelMaskPairNormalizer.h:76:7: error: 'string' is not a member of 'std'
 heiko	guess include is missing
 blackburn1	I would personally kick chris' ass for usage of std but he is moving to NY
 heiko	;)
 blackburn1	that would be hard to catch him
 blackburn1	okay I'll take a look
 heiko	blackburn can you help me with a little git problem?
 blackburn1	heiko:
 blackburn1	sure
 heiko	I still have some work in my master branch and i committed it already to my github repo because i wanted to backup it
 heiko	however, the code is not yet really working
 heiko	but if i want to do a bugfix i cannot send pullrequests
 heiko	because all my changes are in there
 heiko	do you know how to move this stuff to another branch or something so that i can work on head without any of my other changes involved?
 blackburn1	you can stash your changes for now
 blackburn1	git stash
 blackburn1	it will keep your changes until you will git stash pop it
 heiko	does that even work if they are already in my github repo?
 blackburn1	heiko: ah did you commit it?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn1	hmm
 heiko	its also already pushed
 heiko	you know i wanted to backup itonline, kind of stupid
 blackburn1	not a stupid
 heiko	but i was in a hurry and i did not want to loose all of my changes
 heiko	moving to london, plane, laptop broken or anything...you know
 heiko	but now I want to put them away to work on them later
 blackburn1	huh that's difficult
 heiko	yes.
 heiko	i thought of perhaps to the brute force way and save my repo copy here and just reset my github account
 heiko	and then work the stuff in again later
 heiko	i have to reconsider it anyway
 heiko	think i will jsut do this
 blackburn1	heiko: I'm sorry but I have no idea how to change your base in this way
 blackburn1	I'm still lame with some git issues
 heiko	me too :)
 heiko	reforking ...
 blackburn1	heiko: I would know more if I was using forks and etc
 blackburn1	but I commit right into the shogun and it is pretty simplified
 heiko	yes, with all the forks and stuff -- thats pretty messy sometimes
 heiko	well i just cloned it
 blackburn1	heiko: from my experience it comes easy to have some dev branch
 heiko	yes, true true, i normally do that
 blackburn1	but even this becomes messy sometimes
 heiko	but not this time :)
 blackburn1	oh I really need to stop procrastinate and compiling lapack
 blackburn1	and start research on road sign recognition
 blackburn1	:D
 heiko	for studies?
 blackburn1	yeah, it is my bachelor's work or so
 blackburn1	but if I go through it with high accuracy I would even get paid for that
 heiko	that sounds cool
 heiko	blackburn1, the file with the error is full of std::
 heiko	i will just add an include or so
 blackburn1	heiko: are you going to fix it? I can
 heiko	i can do it
 blackburn1	heiko: if you have time please do, cause it is not being reproduced on my
 blackburn1	machine
 heiko	done
 blackburn1	heiko: does it work?
 blackburn1	heiko: there are vector too, is it ok?
 heiko	yes, but they are included in Kernel.h
 blackburn1	ah ok
 CIA-37	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * r54afa01 / src/shogun/kernel/MultitaskKernelMaskPairNormalizer.h :
 CIA-37	shogun: temporary added include to compile again
 CIA-37	shogun: (string include was recently removed out of Kernel.h) - http://git.io/qOdR6w
