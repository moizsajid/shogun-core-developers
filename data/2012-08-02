 n4nd0	and MOSEK libraries
 blackburn	okay sure but why not to have it automatically?
 n4nd0	no idea
 blackburn	so should I do that? :)
 n4nd0	maybe Soeren just didn't want that I'd spend time with that
 blackburn	yeah I can
 n4nd0	sure, why not
 blackburn	n4nd0: can you help me with that a little?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	i need a minimal example
 blackburn	that fails w/o mosek
 blackburn	and flags you use
 blackburn	-lmosek or so?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I can give you that
 n4nd0	I will do that tomorrow morning
 n4nd0	I am going early today to sleep
 blackburn	wanted to make it now :)
 blackburn	just say what are flags
 blackburn	-lmosek?
 n4nd0	wait a moment, I sent Nico a mail with the exact steps
 n4nd0	-- In the line that start with DEFINES add -DUSE_MOSEK.
 n4nd0	-- In the line INCLUDES add -I/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/h
 n4nd0	where /usr/local/etc/ is the path to your mosek installation directory that may
 n4nd0	be different for you.
 n4nd0	-- In the line LINKFLAGS add -L/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin
 n4nd0	where it applies the same as before about the mosek isntallation directory.
 n4nd0	- In POSTLINKFLAGS add -lmosek.
 n4nd0	I love the function of search in the mails :D
 blackburn	thanks got it
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you go already?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no
 n4nd0	tell me
 blackburn	n4nd0: these paths wouldn't work as something default I am afraid
 blackburn	so one would need to set up these paths on configure
 n4nd0	whereis mosek outputs /usr/local/etc/mosek in my machine
 n4nd0	maybe that could work?
 n4nd0	although I do remember I told Soeren the same thing and he said that it was not platform independent
 blackburn	does it have pkg-config?
 n4nd0	no idea what that is
 blackburn	cool thing allowing to do
 blackburn	something like
 blackburn	pkg-config --cflags mosek
 n4nd0	let me try to exec that
 blackburn	but probably it would not work
 n4nd0	Package mosek was not found in the pkg-config search path.
 n4nd0	Perhaps you should add the directory containing `mosek.pc'
 n4nd0	to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
 n4nd0	No package 'mosek' foun
 n4nd0	you were right
 n4nd0	doesn't work
 n4nd0	:S
 blackburn	okay I've added something

 Marina	hello, if i train a svm with dna sequence for splice site recognition, do the sequences with the splice site must have the +1 or the -1 label?
 n4nd0	hi Marina
 n4nd0	yes, if you use a binary classifier, for example one of the binary SVMs, the labels have to be either +1 or -1
 Marina	hi n4nd0 so, there is no difference, if i use the +1 one label for the sequences with the splice site, i.e. the positive examples, or if i use the -1 label for  the sequences with the splice site?
 n4nd0	Marina: what are the two classes in your problem? I am not familiarized with splice site recognition
 n4nd0	but I'd say that in any binary classification problem you should learn the same model if the labels are swapped
 n4nd0	so it shouldn't make a difference
 Marina	after training the svm i make a poim with the svm result - and the picture look different when training with -1 or +1 for the splice site sequences.
 n4nd0	Marina: even if they look different, aren't they equivalent in some sense?
 n4nd0	Marina: have you tried comparing the results of the weight vector after training with +1 and -1?
 Marina	i will proof it! Thanks a lot
 n4nd0	you are welcome
 n4nd0	Marina: what svm classifier are you using by the way?
 Marina	i use LibSVM
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I have just a test with libsvm
 n4nd0	I have train my svm two times, the second time swapping the labels of the training examples with respect to the first time
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@108.171.196.83] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 n4nd0	and I have printed the alphas, which define the model learnt, both times
 n4nd0	the values are the same in both cases, with the exception that the signs are changed
 n4nd0	e.g. the first time I get something like [0.68 -1 ...], the second time [-0.68 1 ...]
 n4nd0	and that actually makes sense, graphically the hyperplane is the same
 n4nd0	but the meaning of each region changes when the labels are swapped
 n4nd0	Marina: could it be that the change in the signs made the poim different?
 koen-shogun	by default, the costs (e.g. weights) of the classes are the same
 koen-shogun	so you'd expect nearly the same solution
 Marina	n4nd0 yes - that should be the reason!

 yoo	hi all
 blackburn	hey
 yoo	blackburn: reading your mail, thx for answering
 blackburn	yoo: btw why do you use C++?
 yoo	blackburn: simply because I am more comfortable with c++
 yoo	blackburn: and since I have made some modifications in c++ shogun code ..
 yoo	blackburn:do you usually use python interface ?
 blackburn	yeah
-!- audy is now known as octopine
 blackburn	well it is just the same actually and loading data in  C++ is usually a kind of pain
 yoo	the thing is when I create my own c++ class, I have no experience in wrapping in python form
 yoo	could be the time I get into this ..

 KMcQuisten	Hello all
 blackburn	hello
 KMcQuisten	I'm getting some really odd behavior form LibSVR, and I was wondering if you all could help.  I can set up a kernel, initialize it, load that kernel and some labels into the LibSVR object, and then train the machine.  However, when I try and make a prediction, either on the training set using apply() or on a set of unseen features using apply(Cfeatures), it predicts an output of 1.0 for everythign, regardless of what I input.
 KMcQuisten	I have a script I can send you to reproduce this.
 blackburn	hmm sure, show me
 KMcQuisten	Sent
 KMcQuisten	What do you think?
 blackburn	give me 5 mins more :)
 KMcQuisten	No problem :)
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-181-156-213.range86-181.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	ahh
 KMcQuisten	So what's the verdict?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: for now use apply_regression
 blackburn	instead of apply
 KMcQuisten	Allrighty :)
 blackburn	I will check why it calls apply_binary here
 KMcQuisten	Thanks for the help
 blackburn	heiko!
 heiko	blackburn
 heiko	hi!
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	a few things to discuss I have you to
 heiko	ohoh
 blackburn	heiko: mind talk I yoda like?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	thou shall he
 heiko	:D
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	I heard you like multiclass
 blackburn	so I put multiclass into multiclass
 blackburn	okay I stop joking
 blackburn	heiko: first thing
 heiko	go ahead!
 blackburn	are you familiar how multiclass machines work currently?
 blackburn	you must be
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	lets just say yes
 heiko	I fixed a few bugs in these so almost
 blackburn	how do you think we could pass
 blackburn	these scores
 blackburn	to some evaluation
 blackburn	problem is that
 blackburn	multiclass labels is num + confidence
 heiko	you mean the score from OvO etc?
 blackburn	but for multiclass ROC we would need more confidences
 blackburn	OvO ROC is probably not really informativ
 blackburn	e
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	I see
 blackburn	but OvR one would be nice
 heiko	we got confidences on the one side
 heiko	and scores on the other
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	As I see it we are currently abusing the term confidence by putting scores in there that are not calibrated probabilities right?
 heiko	so why not have two fields: scores AND probabilities
 heiko	probabilities can be used as scores
 heiko	but not the other way round
 heiko	and also it would have the advantage that users are not confused (I tend to be confused with these things for example)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	but wait
 heiko	any problems with that?
 blackburn	what do we need to compute OvR roc?
 heiko	Possible with both
 heiko	oh wait
 heiko	no
 heiko	its not possible to compute real probabilities for OvR
 blackburn	so for each vector
 heiko	its not really a probabilistic framework
 blackburn	we need all outputs
 heiko	I mean its possible to approximate this
 blackburn	is OvO probabilistic?
 heiko	but scores are fine for ROC are they
 heiko	no
 heiko	SVM have no probabilistic interpretation anyway
 heiko	all probabilities are just approximations or fitted sigmoids
 heiko	couldnt we make this all optional?
 heiko	I mean currently shogun cannot compute any probabilities on the output
 heiko	I wanted to add that anyway once the labels could do it
 heiko	but I still think its a good idea to distringuish
 blackburn	hmm why do you want probabilities?
 heiko	for example, the GP has a probabilistic interpretation, there you have only probabilities and not really scoresy
 heiko	well for multiclass its great to compute posterior probabilities isnt it?
 blackburn	probably
 heiko	first class 33% second class 32%, which one to take
 heiko	using the one with largest scores looses something
 heiko	on the other side:
 heiko	whenever you have probabilities, you dont need scores anymore
 heiko	its just when you have no probabilities
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	then you need the scores
 blackburn	problem is that
 blackburn	we currently discard scores and probabilities of rest classes
 blackburn	when choosing one
 heiko	but its also possible to "fake" probabilities, as for example for multiclass SVMs
 heiko	then you got two different numbers
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	blackburn, what were the other things?
 blackburn	I can't really see how to handle that
 blackburn	heiko: other other
 blackburn	other is
 blackburn	modelselection output
 blackburn	what do you think is the way to *store* these things it prints now
 heiko	why do you want to do that?
 heiko	for producing plots etc?
 heiko	what about adding a method that collects all performance measures for all parameter combinations?
 heiko	and then output and array with that
 blackburn	heiko: hmm
 blackburn	heiko: yes, for plots and everything
 heiko	what exactly do you want to do with that?
 blackburn	okay currently it prints everything
 blackburn	probably it would be better to store it
 blackburn	and not to print
 heiko	do you also want to store all indices etc?
 heiko	or just performance per point?
 blackburn	no, indices
 blackburn	too
 blackburn	probably
 heiko	why?
 blackburn	I think it is needed sometimes for reproducibility
 blackburn	people really often make they own xval and modelselection snippets
 heiko	I cannot imagine why one would want that. The thing about x-validation is that is gives you a normal distributed estimate of the real performance
 heiko	I agree, because shogun often does not work ;)
 heiko	when it does, one doesnt need the indices in my eyes, or I can't imagine a use-case for that
 heiko	another thought: SHOGUN's model selection/x-validation is more for end-user cases: to automagically select parameters or get a performance measure. Its not really designed for analysing what happens in x-val.
 heiko	But thats a wide field and its almost impossible to cover everything that you might want to do with x-val.
 heiko	so if people want to analyse more subtle stuff, they will have to write their own routines
 heiko	and if they just want the distribution of the performance measure, we can add that
 heiko	blackburn, what about the testing PR from wiking?
 blackburn	oops
 heiko	that is something I am really interested in :)
 blackburn	sorry got distracted
 heiko	no worries :)
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	I never got back to that PR atually
 blackburn	heiko: can't we put GPL to readme or so?
 blackburn	it is so damn big
 heiko	ehm, where?
 heiko	in the tutorial?
 heiko	blackburn, whats wrong with having it in the appendix?
 blackburn	heiko: yeah, why to have it where?
 heiko	I had this book-style in mind, so if printed, its good to put it somewhere
 heiko	but I dont insist on it
 heiko	we can give an url :)
 heiko	just
 heiko	for this license for documentation
 heiko	it sais that the document contains a section where the full license is printed
 heiko	thats why I added it
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	okay let it stay then
 heiko	but I dont know whether its compulsory

 blackburn	heiko: btw there is a shogun book already :D
 blackburn	http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shogun-toolbox-Ronald-Jesse-Russell/dp/B007OV760A
 heiko	lol :D
 heiko	is that actually written?
 heiko	look fakey
 blackburn	fake for sure
 blackburn	heiko: did you visit something at games?
 heiko	blackburn, not yet
 blackburn	will you? :)
 heiko	but I cannot get the motivation for this, I find it rather boring -- but I feel bad for this
 heiko	and so  much work currently
 blackburn	heiko: probably it is not so special in your countries :D
 blackburn	there is a good old hype around this
 blackburn	"we must secure our regime via a lot of gold medals!!"
 blackburn	that's how china acts actually and soviet union been acting :D
 heiko	well, yes it is, its actually amazing, and also a great opportunity since its next door, thats why I feel bad for not being interested :D
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	I like that approach btw ;)
 blackburn	why?
 heiko	because it seems to naive
 blackburn	well competition is good
 heiko	kind of odd
 blackburn	but with all these dopes china uses (I am sure they do)
 blackburn	it stops to be a competition of athletes :D
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	everybody does this
 heiko	the chinese are just best at staying closely under the accepted limit
 blackburn	they just find it important to produce these roboathletes, normal countries are more relaxed I believe :)

 n4nd0	how is it going?
 blackburn	well pretty fine, finishing up yet another refactoring of multiclass
 blackburn	and you?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you are right about the label stuff - if you swap +1 <-> -1 POIMs will be inverted...
 n4nd0	I am fine too

@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, well MKL and POIMs are not exactly trivial stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: mind send us a reminder?

 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	n4nd0, hmmhh so neither you nor nico will attend?
@sonney2k	blackburn, argh so let me send some reminder ...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am not sure about Nico, but he has not been answering my mails for a long while ... so my guess is that we won't make it
 n4nd0	I am sorry
 blackburn	I bet it will be low population
 n4nd0	sonney2k: if you let me know about other topics that were going to be discussed in the sesion I can include them in the mail
 n4nd0	if that is ok for you of course
