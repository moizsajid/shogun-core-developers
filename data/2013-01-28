 sonne|work	blackburn: how do I add a field to the form? I did add an email addr column
 sonne|work	but that is not automagically in the form
 blackburn	sonne|work: noo, use the form in menu
 blackburn	form (0)
 sonne|work	and then?
 blackburn	edit form
 sonne|work	yes but how do I add it there?
 blackburn	add item in the top left
 sonne|work	I want name and then email address
 sonne|work	and then what?
 blackburn	some field will appear
 blackburn	drag it to the place you want
 blackburn	and edit
 sonne|work	ok maybe I did it correctly
 sonne|work	now
 sonne|work	n4nd0: anything missing?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: name and email is enough I think
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well look at what blackburn sent around
 n4nd0	when? I didn't get anything during the past minutes
 sonne|work	blackburn: should we ask about vegeterian food?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yesterday
 n4nd0	the google docs, checking atm
 blackburn	I don't know - is it highly relevant? I get to know only one vegetarian so far :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: you barbarians!
 blackburn	sonne|work: how can one do not eat meat :D
 n4nd0	nothing else I can come up with mmm
 sonne|work	blackburn: do we need badges?
 blackburn	sonne|work: would be cool I think
 blackburn	it could be kind of souvenir :D
 n4nd0	+1 to the badges idea :)
 sonne|work	t-shirts too right ;^)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah! :D

 sonne|work	heiko: moin!
 sonne|work	heiko: please also give feedback about the form!
 heiko	sonne|work, hi!
 heiko	checking it out ...
 heiko	sonne|work this form is for before the workshop right?
 n4nd0	heiko: I think is to keep track of the pople who wants to attent to the workshop
 sonne|work	heiko: to register for the workshop
 n4nd0	so yeah before the workshop
 heiko	ok
 heiko	then I did not understand the question
 heiko	If you weren't satisfied with something, could you explain here what it was?
 heiko	and the rest is in the comments
 sonne|work	heiko: about shogun?
 heiko	but this looks good
 heiko	I see
 heiko	maybe we should formulate this differently
 n4nd0	what is this lookalike contest that was mentioned the other day about?
 blackburn	heiko: you can edit too ;)
 heiko	blackburn, I see, but I rather comment and let you edit to avoid confusion
 sonne|work	blackburn: once this is done - will this form send an email to the list or do you have to do that?
 blackburn	sonne|work: we can set up notifications
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	well one can set up notifications for himself

 sonne|work	blackburn: well that would work
 sonne|work	I could add some rule matching the pattern to forward this to the mailinglist
 blackburn	sonne|work:  I can receive mails and just answer with CC
 sonne|work	yeah but that is :/
 sonne|work	better directly post it to the list

 heiko	blackburn, I dont get you with check possible answers in form.
 blackburn	heiko: ehm have you seen the form?
 heiko	arhg
 heiko	I thought this was the template for it
 blackburn	I suspect you saw only table :D
 heiko	no
 heiko	is it on the website?
 blackburn	heiko: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFoS0Q2U19qYkdjT2VReFNvNDBoclE6MQ
 blackburn	no, use Form (0) - Edit form in menu
 heiko	I see
 heiko	can I edit?
 blackburn	yes
 heiko	ah cool
 heiko	I did not even know that google docs could do this :)
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	that would not be cool to ask users to fill in a table
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	no
 heiko	I thought this was just brainstorming, whatever
 heiko	I think we should have this "how to set-up shogun" tutorial, but it finds in no category
 blackburn	heiko: may be in discuss part?
 heiko	its not really a discussion, is it?
 blackburn	I don't know
 heiko	I think this list of ML stuff might be renamed: On which of these topics would you like a tutorial
 heiko	then we could put that in
 blackburn	heiko: feel free to edit I have poor grammar :D
 heiko	done :)
 heiko	ok gotta work now, see you later
 blackburn	see you

 blackburn	heiko: have you ever played fallout?
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	blackburn, why you ask?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	heiko: I stumbled upon a photo and created this https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/fallout.jpg
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	haha
 blackburn	pure russia
 heiko	 :)
 blackburn	magnitogorsk
 heiko	well, I have played it :)
 blackburn	heiko: that one with a cigarette looks like a rad-monster!
 blackburn	with camouflage :D
 heiko	ha!
 heiko	nice one :)
 blackburn	heiko: http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/7591058/original.jpg that's what it was before my GIMP
 heiko	man thats even worse
 blackburn	heiko: lol I've accidentally hidden factories
 heiko	yes
 heiko	so you made the image less-falloutish
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	heiko: I should use that pic to convince sonney2k that things are not the same in different countries
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	why doesnt he believe this? :)
 blackburn	heiko: no idea :) but he even wasn't even surprised when I told him that a man was killed with a champagne bottle in police
 blackburn	double even hah
 heiko	Russian is a wild country I guess
 blackburn	heiko: sure
 blackburn	you will see once you see me
 heiko	haha :)
 heiko	so many scars?
 blackburn	heiko: hmm don't have any :(
 heiko	mmh, well then I got more than you :)
 blackburn	heiko: I was asked about combining linear and gaussian kernels
 heiko	blackburn, and?
 blackburn	linear is like in [-1,1]
 blackburn	and gaussian is in [0,1]
 blackburn	anything to do with it?
 heiko	what means "in"?
 blackburn	in range
 heiko	I dont really get what you mean
 heiko	the range of the kernel function?
 blackburn	heiko: they have different value domains yes
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	and now they have to be combined?
 blackburn	yeah - is it ok?
 heiko	as long as the linear kernel matrix is psd, this is fine
 heiko	the linear one wont be negative when the argument is equal right?
 heiko	since that would destroy it
 blackburn	yeah psd is not a problem
 blackburn	linear combination is still mercer kernel I know
 blackburn	but just these different domains - I never though about that
 heiko	no that is fine
 heiko	kernel always goes to real numbers
 heiko	since it is an inner product
 blackburn	heiko: no I am not talking about C :)
 heiko	what?
 blackburn	heiko: complex numbers
 blackburn	I mean :)
 heiko	why should this negative range be a problem? It is allowed since a kernel is a map X x X => R where X is some set
 heiko	so what problem should be there?
 blackburn	hah no problem I just find that interesting

 tomv_	hi. so with blackburn's help I got shogun for python running. but now I am wondering: the FITCInferenceMethod seems to only work when the number of latent features is equal to the number of features.
 blackburn	hi tomv_
 tomv_	This is surprising to me, having looked at gpml and also read rasmussen and williams' book...
 blackburn	tomv_: that could be hard as I never managed to get throught rasmussens' book
 tomv_	well, really the sparse stuff is much better in the overview article IMHO
 blackburn	Regular and Latent Features do not match in dimensionality
 blackburn	you get that, right?
 tomv_	yes.
 tomv_	well, it is unfair to call it a review article. I had been looking at "A Unifying View of Sparse Approximate Gaussian Process"
 tomv_	or looking at the Large Scale Regression section on http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
 blackburn	tomv_: do you have some reproducing code?
 tomv_	gpml does.
 blackburn	argh heiko has left the room already
 tomv_	if you look at the picture, the circles are the latent features. unless latent features is something other than inducing inputs.
 blackburn	tomv_: did yuo check that example on fitc we have in examples/undocumented/libshogun?
 tomv_	actually I used the one in examples/documented/libshogun and tried to port it to python to give a small token of appreciation for your help.
 blackburn	tomv_: so black circles are kind of latent variables?
 tomv_	but then I stumbled over my idea of how FITC works being literally incompatible to shogun's(?)
 tomv_	python: /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen/src/Core/DenseCoeffsBase.h:352: Scalar &Eigen::DenseCoeffsBase<Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1>, 0, Eigen::Stride<0, 0> >, 1>::operator()(Index, Index) [Derived = Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1>, 0, Eigen::Stride<0, 0> >, Level = 1]: Assertion `row >= 0 && row < rows() && col >= 0 && col < cols()' failed.
 tomv_	Aborted
 blackburn	uh
 tomv_	is what I get.
 tomv_	yes, that is my understanding
 blackburn	I have no understanding so far as I am stupid code monkey that knows only dimension reduction :D
 blackburn	could you share that failing code?
 tomv_	sure.
 blackburn	tomv_: are you subscribed to the mailing list?
 tomv_	http://vman.de/shogun/regression_gaussian_process_fitc_demo.py
 tomv_	no
 blackburn	I am asking because there is a guy who can help you with GPs I think
 blackburn	heiko strathmann that is - I see you can even talk in person in your common language with more understanding  :)
 blackburn	man I like your homepage :)
 blackburn	ok let me check example now
 blackburn	tomv_: I get another error message, not eigen3 one
 tomv_	fascinating.
 tomv_	what do you get?
 blackburn	something about parameters
 blackburn	I'll try to work it out
 tomv_	have you compiled without nlopt
 tomv_	?
 blackburn	ahh right
 tomv_	ha.
 blackburn	okay let me compile with nlopt then
 blackburn	hmmm wait
 blackburn	it is with nlopt already
 blackburn	surprise
 blackburn	anyway recompiling
 blackburn	I get segfault actually
 tomv_	that should not happen in python, either. though the abort is really bad, too.
 tomv_	maybe you have optimised the assetions away?
 tomv_	don't know if that can happen with nlopt
 tomv_	I am using the stock debian/sid one.
 blackburn	tomv_: segfault happens with python - why not? shogun is C++
-!- n4nd0 [53b32c87@gateway/web/freenode/ip.83.179.44.135] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: really nice form
 blackburn	n4nd0: thanks to goolge :)
 tomv_	blackburn: well, segfault in python means the lib has a bug.
 blackburn	tomv_: exactly
 n4nd0	tomv_, blackburn where do we have a segfault?
 blackburn	n4nd0: in parameters stuff
 n4nd0	mmm I see
 tomv_	actually, I don't have one, I get assertion errors (which, I would imagine, would lead to a segfault if the assertion is skipped due to optimization options in nlopt)
 n4nd0	tomv_: mmm if you get an assertion error then execution *must* stop
 n4nd0	ahhh ok I see what you mean
 tomv_	hm, why?
 n4nd0	well because the assertion works like that
 n4nd0	assert(boolean expression)
 n4nd0	if the boolean expression is false, then stop
 n4nd0	tomv_: agree?
 tomv_	well, to be honest, I might think that exiting the python interpreter because a function call ran into an assertion error is excessive.
 tomv_	it's assert, not falloverifitsnot.
 n4nd0	tomv_: mmm
 n4nd0	but an assert is used to stop if the expression given is false right?
 tomv_	yes.
 n4nd0	I mean say I want to compute the distances between two sets of features
 n4nd0	if one of them is empty
 n4nd0	then it makes sense to stop rightaway
 n4nd0	because it doesn't make sense to compute the distance between some features and nothing
 tomv_	well, actually, the c++ spec says that the program should abort.
 tomv_	so yes.
 tomv_	not "spec" , reference
 n4nd0	tomv_: ok anyway, all this was almost philosophic :)
 n4nd0	what do you have in your code a failed assertion or a seg fault?
 tomv_	and it says that compiling with NDEBUG the assertions are stricken.
 tomv_	I have a failed assertion, blackburn has the segfault.
 tomv_	http://vman.de/shogun/regression_gaussian_process_fitc_demo.py
 tomv_	running the above.
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I cannot test it right now
 n4nd0	but if you have a failed assertion, I'd suggest to check the inputs you are giving there
 tomv_	I am afraid sleeping might be the first order of business for me. good night and thanks for your interest.

 blackburn	heiko1: !
 blackburn	we missed you
 heiko1	I hope so :)
 blackburn	heiko1: there was a guy who complained about GPs
 heiko1	complained?
 blackburn	heiko1: yes it doesn't work
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	blackburn, I know
 blackburn	heiko1: do you know about FITC?
 heiko1	Jacob implemented that riught?
 blackburn	exactly
 heiko1	I couldnt even make regression work when I tried it :)
 blackburn	but you said you are going to be a GP master
 heiko1	Yeah, I want to take this over
 blackburn	I have a feeling you didn't so far
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	worked with GP over the last months
 blackburn	okayface
 heiko1	well its a lot of work
 heiko1	quite a big framwork
 heiko1	and not so much time here :)
 heiko1	I even reserached new methods that I want to implement :)
 blackburn	I am confused with a lot of things in shogun
 heiko1	but gotta do something else now
 heiko1	so see you in a bit
 blackburn	heiko1: okay
 n4nd0	blackburn: so how many days do you think we will be shoguning in Berlin?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I expect only tow
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	two
 n4nd0	it sounds fine
 n4nd0	the plan is to see if we can be at TU the second day right?
 n4nd0	and what is this lookalike contest?! hehe
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	just joke (*I hope*)
 n4nd0	are we going to look for people that look like you? hehe
 n4nd0	I think the competition thing for the audience is a very nice idea
 n4nd0	btw
 n4nd0	nvm
 blackburn	nvm?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	hehe yeah was going to ask sth but I answered myself instead :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, the issue tomv_ is having is the one I am debugging...
@sonney2k	no success yet though
* sonney2k is happy to be online again
@sonney2k	bricked the router and hat to short circuit some pins on the flash chip
