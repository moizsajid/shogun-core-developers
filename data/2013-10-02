 lisitsyn	besser82: haha lowcost
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: so I am going fedora soon!
 besser82	lisitsyn: low cost?
 besser82	lisitsyn: That would be great :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: 'just' one cigarette & coffee ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah sure
 lisitsyn	besser82: I think I want to learn how to package stuff
 besser82	lisitsyn: It more meant to be a timeframe  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: Then you're on the right guy ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: just kidding
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have two header libraries I believe one can find convenient ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: sounds great!

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what about tapkee?
 besser82	iglesiasg: I already packaged it  ;)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what about tapkee?
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	yes besser82 is bester
 lisitsyn	;)
@iglesiasg	awesome
 besser82	lisitsyn: Both libs look really promising ;)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=tapkee-devel
@iglesiasg	cool
 lisitsyn	besser82: they both come from tapkee actually
 besser82	lisitsyn: so they are bundled inside?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah they are inside of tapkee
 lisitsyn	but currently the versions inside of tapkee are older than 'trunk'
 besser82	lisitsyn: how about unbundling them from tapkee?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I'd definitely do that
 besser82	lisitsyn: like BuildRequires?
 besser82	lisitsyn: bundling is always somewhat bad...
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is like in process of cell division you know
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure
 lisitsyn	meiosis whatever :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: i know
 besser82	lisitsyn: most stuff started as being a subroutine of soething other ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: last week I tried to extract gui from blender
 besser82	lisitsyn: for which purpose?
 lisitsyn	well I died there just like anyone else who tried that
 lisitsyn	besser82: just for fun as usual
 lisitsyn	:)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I see :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: don't you like blender ui?

 besser82	lisitsyn: Never really used that
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm not the "pixel ninja" ;)
 lisitsyn	oh I used to model cool stuff in 3ds max when I was like 9
 besser82	lisitsyn: If you want to start with Fedora, I'd recommend to install recent F20 pre-beta  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: when is release date?
 besser82	lisitsyn: End of Nov ~27 or so
 lisitsyn	besser82: would I have to do anything when it is released?
 besser82	lisitsyn: acutally doing updates ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: you'll get final automatically
 lisitsyn	oh okay
 lisitsyn	how do you estimate chances of catching some bad issues? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: not much
 besser82	lisitsyn: I actually did get any severe problems
 besser82	lisitsyn: there has been some annoying quirks in pre-alpha, but they are gone
 besser82	lisitsyn: but those were more about apps than related to the core system

 lisitsyn	besser82: I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: since alpha-release in last week everythng seems to be fixed
 besser82	lisitsyn:  http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah thanks
 besser82	lisitsyn: np. you're welcome :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: If there are any questions, feel free to ask me  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: thanks
 besser82	lisitsyn: btw.  You can just `dd` the iso to a stick and install from it  ;)  Image is oversized, currently  :(
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah that's how I wanted to do that
 besser82	lisitsyn: allright :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: what is the other way? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: other way? of installing?
 lisitsyn	I don't install os'es too often so I always forget how it is done
 besser82	lisitsyn: burning on DVD  ;)
 lisitsyn	what is DVD?
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: something which got deprecated by blue-ray some while ago
 lisitsyn	blue what?
 besser82	lisitsyn: older people still can remember  XD
 lisitsyn	is there anybody using optical stuff?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well I remember floppy
 lisitsyn	2.5" only though
 besser82	lisitsyn: me, too.  The 8" ones :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: 120K (when using both sides)
 lisitsyn	but I had red hat 6.0 loader on a floppy drive
 lisitsyn	I think it was lilo
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes
 besser82	lisitsyn: it was lilo
 lisitsyn	hmm let me think what year it was
 besser82	lisitsyn: must have been ~ 2000
 besser82	lisitsyn: I can remember datasette, too  .-P
 lisitsyn	well I had no consciousness yet in 2000
 lisitsyn	it was my brother who installed red hat there I think
 lisitsyn	but I was excited
 lisitsyn	console!
 lisitsyn	besser82: what is datasette/
 lisitsyn	?
 besser82	lisitsyn: something used when floppy was expensive
 lisitsyn	ha
 lisitsyn	besser82: I guess 82 is your birth year? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: right ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: sonne|work should remember even more then ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: With datasette you could store stuff on MC  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: much cheaper ~25 years ago
 lisitsyn	hah
 lisitsyn	well some backups are still on mag-tape
 besser82	lisitsyn: I know ;)
 lisitsyn	due to being crazy cheap
 besser82	lisitsyn: but this was actually the cheapest thing in the 80s
 besser82	lisitsyn: a MC was ~$3
 besser82	lisitsyn: a floppy disk ~$12

 wiking	besser82: pin
 wiking	besser82: what's up with the machine?
 wiking	or u r still setting up stuff?
 besser82	wiking: sry, been afk
 besser82	wiking: I'm wating for nirik to get the additional storage setup
 wiking	besser82: additional storage setup?
 wiking	besser82: is that necessary to get started with simple stuff?
 besser82	wiking: yes the 25GB persistent HDD
 wiking	ah no worries
 wiking	there is currently some hdd space or?
 besser82	wiking: there's currently ~4G for system, only  :(
 wiking	how much is left?
 wiking	as really there's heaps of stuff to do
 besser82	wiking: not too much free ~1.9G or so...
 wiking	that tdoes not require any space
 wiking	so if it's possible add me and i'll start setting up the other parts...
 besser82	wiking: the other thing is nirik didn't setup the fasclient, yet  :(
 besser82	wiking: but I'll bump someone else to get it done asap  :)
 wiking	ahok
 besser82	wiking: fasclient is for automagically create users and perms...
 besser82	wiking: If I'd manually setup a user for you, that might lead to some errors and stuff
 besser82	wiking: what is to be done so urgently?
 besser82	wiking: I'm currently working on creating an rpm for ipython 1.10...
 besser82	wiking: So setup should be doable really fast
 wiking	besser82: easy_install ipython
 besser82	wiking: shogun rpm from current snapshot is ready already on my local workstation  :)
 wiking	really no need for rpm
 besser82	wiking: there is already, but still on 0.13.2
 besser82	wiking: so i'm just updating it ;)
 wiking	we'll need shogun git repo checked out on that machine
 wiking	i.e. installed via rpm is not necessary
 besser82	wiking: that shouldn't be the problem ;)
 besser82	wiking: so you want to do snapshot builds?
 besser82	wiking: I think that might be a security risk....
 besser82	wiking: I can handle building rpms on gitcheckouts using f-i's jenkins...
 besser82	wiking: and get them updated on the machine, then
 besser82	wiking: having cc on a machine with shell access free for all is basically like parking a lambo with keys plugged...

 wiking	sorry but i dont see the difference between installing a binary package and installing something from src
 wiking	concering security
 wiking	shell access 4 all?
 besser82	wiking: basically the presence of some cc.
 wiking	cc?
 besser82	wiking: c-compiler
 wiking	besser82: well we can chroot a compiler somewhere ;)
 wiking	i.e. don't install it system wide
 besser82	wiking: might be an idea...
 sonne|work	besser82, wiking or you take a normal system and have the current one in a chroot

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I thought that static interfaces were back, or?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, mentioning because of your mail to Sam
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: they are
@iglesiasg	then, why deprecated?
@HeikoS	because not developed anymore
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, well, but if someone wants to use something implemented in static, it should work, right?
@iglesiasg	I understand that static interfaces are not synced
@iglesiasg	they don't have all the stuff that is implemented in the C++ core
@iglesiasg	but I thought that the stuff that is implemented for static, should still work
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes
@HeikoS	thats what deprecated means right? ;)
@HeikoS	still works but not developed
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, aham ok!
@HeikoS	we have R-modular now
@HeikoS	matlab is the last one missing
@iglesiasg	with deprecated I understand that something should not be used
@iglesiasg	but anyway, is more a semantic thing
@HeikoS	yeah, maybe send a mail and tell him that its fine to use them
@iglesiasg	I guess it is fine
@iglesiasg	seems to be more a problem of mine :)

 lambday	so I just mentioned the link where it is downloaded from in the header... that should be fine, right?
 lambday	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/JacobiEllipticFunctions.h#L13
 lisitsyn	lambday: as I can see it is BSD 3-clause

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: first release ready version of GP notebook
 lambday	lisitsyn: alright then..
@HeikoS	lambday: BSD means " do whatever you want"
 lambday	HeikoS: hahaha :D
 lambday	HeikoS: keeping you, sonney2k wiking in CC
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: and 3 clause means just keep us alone
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	just don't say about us :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: what do you mean? so I shouldn't mention that we have been using your software? just that I found this bug?
 lisitsyn	lambday: you can't advertise your software using their name
 lisitsyn	lambday: if they didn't let you to do that
 lambday	lisitsyn: but I am reporting a bug :( not advertising :(
 lisitsyn	lambday: then it is ok
 lambday	lisitsyn: alright then.. mentioning that we have been using ARPREC in Shogun..
 lisitsyn	lambday: if it is 3 clause then you have to ask if you can promote your software with their software
 lisitsyn	but well
 lisitsyn	I wouldn't care
 lambday	lisitsyn: then I just I should just skip that part and go straight to the bug that I found.. I have the gist, will just send them the link!
 lisitsyn	I don't really understand what is the issue
 lisitsyn	what bug and what do you want to do?
 lambday	lisitsyn: so we have used this software in one of our modules, and recently discovered a memory leak that's caused by the library itself (which in turn is causing other parts in shogun leak)..
 lisitsyn	okay next
 lisitsyn	this has nothing to do with license
 lambday	lisitsyn: so HeikoS suggested that we should report that to the developers..
 lisitsyn	yes that's exactly what you'd better do
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah but I was thinking whether I should mention Shogun at all!.. yeah I should just report the bug
 lisitsyn	yes it is ok to mention
 lisitsyn	it is not that strict
 lambday	mention as in 'we have used it' or 'we're speaking on behalf of' :D
 lisitsyn	both are ok
 lambday	cool then!
@HeikoS	lambday: thanks for doing this btw
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday going home, see you! :)
 lisitsyn	see ya
 lambday	HeikoS: not a problem
 lambday	HeikoS: see you :) have a good eve :)
@HeikoS	cheers and you too

 lambday	lisitsyn: oh I have been meaning to ask you something... regarding gsoc code submission..
 lambday	lisitsyn: so I have submitted the patch files..
 lisitsyn	yes sure ask
 lambday	lisitsyn: should be fine right?
 lisitsyn	yes
 lambday	lisitsyn: cool!
 lisitsyn	lambday: just don't bother if they didn't say anything

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Removed a few warnings
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: do you happen to know why we have get_energies() const and get_energies() *no const* in Factor?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, oh yes
@iglesiasg	hushell wanted to these two kind of methods
@iglesiasg	I told him to keep just one of them since it was a bit confusing but it seems that in the end some of them (at least one) slipped through
 lisitsyn	okay so I remove it okay?
@iglesiasg	he had a reason for it
@iglesiasg	let me see if I can find it
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, yeah, for me it is totally fine
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: shogun/structure/Factor.cpp:164
 lisitsyn	okay let me just compile
@iglesiasg	but it seems that there was actually a reason for this
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: java knows nothing about constness so there is a warning
@iglesiasg	I understand
 lisitsyn	I see no reason to have both of them
 lisitsyn	totally confusing for me
 lisitsyn	I see a reason to have a member function that returns const reference to something
 lisitsyn	but not const and non const
 lisitsyn	I don't even know how compiler decides what method to use
 lisitsyn	probably const is being called only if you have const reference

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think there is a reason to have both
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, like in general, it is a practice
@iglesiasg	googling it right now
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes I know about that practice
 lisitsyn	the idea is
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aah ok. Tell me about it then :)
 lisitsyn	X giveMeShit();
 lisitsyn	const X& giveMeShit() const;
@iglesiasg	nice example
 lisitsyn	so if you have const reference of that object somewhere
 lisitsyn	const method is called
 lisitsyn	and it returns const reference
 lisitsyn	otherwise you will get a copy
@iglesiasg	it makes sense
@iglesiasg	what about
@iglesiasg	X& giveMeShit();
@iglesiasg	 const X& giveMeShit() const;
 lisitsyn	that's ok but overkill
 lisitsyn	but not legal
 lisitsyn	:D

 lisitsyn	ahh no, legal
 lisitsyn	that's ok
 lisitsyn	but again it is quite wrong
@iglesiasg	wtf
 lisitsyn	so if I get some internal state
@iglesiasg	wrong or not wrong
@iglesiasg	haha
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: okay I have
 lisitsyn	const Object obj;
 lisitsyn	obj.giveMeShit().doStuff();
 lisitsyn	see where I illegally changed internal state?
 lisitsyn	doStuff is not const

@sonney2k	whoa HeikoS http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6685990 crazy sexy cool!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen
@HeikoS	sonney2k, thanks :) that is what I have in mind for the notebooks, as for svm
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, mm it seems a bit weird to me
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I mean if do stuff is not const then the compiler shouldn't allow you to do that since the object is const
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no, internal object is not const
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aah true
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, it is not obj.doStuff
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, still, you sure that would compile?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I think yes
 lisitsyn	X& getShit() const;
 lisitsyn	that won't
@iglesiasg	giveMeShit() would use the const version above
@iglesiasg	in obj.giveMeShit().doStuff()
 lisitsyn	you can't give user any non-const reference if the getter is const
 lisitsyn	yes that thing would fail
