@HeikoS	lambday: I reckon
@HeikoS	lambday: man, so good that we have unit tests now :)
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah!
 lambday	HeikoS: last year when I started there was like 70~100 unit tests
 lambday	now there are like 10k
@HeikoS	lambday: haha indeed
@HeikoS	lambday: when I started I abused libshogun examples as tests
@HeikoS	since there was nothing
@HeikoS	and integration tests were disabled
@HeikoS	thats why we lost so much code since then
@HeikoS	but thats over now

 thoralf	wiking: Just checking if we compiled hdf5 on our own or if we use some distri package... because I read "configure the HDF5 distribution with the --enable-using-memchecker" will solve the HDF5-related uninitialized reads.
 thoralf	wiking: Adding a suppression entry for valgrind would be another option if the first one is rejected. ;)
@wiking	thoralf: distro
@wiking	thoralf: i wouldn't be so keen to roll our own hdf5 library.... i rather go with a suppression
 thoralf	wiking: I'm not 99% sure this is Hdf5 related, because it only affects floatmax_t...
 thoralf	but there's so much copy-pasted code for all different types that checking is a PITA
