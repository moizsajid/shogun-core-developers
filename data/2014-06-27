 wiking	lambday: now yes
 lambday	wiking: for feature selection stuff that I am working on... I need to add get_num_features() in the CFeatures itself... so I currently planned to put this as virtual int32_t get_num_features() const; which in the base class returns 0..
 lambday	wiking: what I wanted to ask.. is that does num_features make sense for LatentFeatures?
 lambday	wiking: or should it just work with base class method and we say that feature selection is not possible with this!
 wiking	lambday: mmmm
 wiking	CFeatures should never have get_num_features
 wiking	sorry but that's a bad approach
 wiking	could you try again that part
-!- wiking [~wiking@info2k1.hu] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 lambday	wiking: yeah but if we want feature selection stuffs to work with generic CFeatures class, then that's not possible unless we have that get_num_features() thing

 lambday	HeikoS2: hi!
 HeikoS2	lambday:  hi there!
 lambday	HeikoS2: I bumped into an issue regarding get_num_features()
 HeikoS2	lambday: currently teaching, but let me know whats up!
 HeikoS2	lambday: which is?
 lambday	HeikoS2: this get_num_features() is needed for feature selection stuffs.. but that's only available for a few implementations of CFeatures
 lambday	HeikoS2: so when working with the base CFeatures, we cannot have that
 HeikoS2	lambday: ah really?
 HeikoS2	lambday: which are the classes for thich it is available
 lambday	HeikoS2: I explained the issue in a mail... sonney2k suggested that get_num_features() is not in the base for the best reason
 HeikoS2	is it for string features?
 lambday	HeikoS2: string, dense, sparse, streaming dense, streaming sparse, hashed doc etc
 lambday	HeikoS2: wiking also suggested the same thing.. it might not be the best idea to put get_num_features() in the base
 lambday	HeikoS2: we can always check if the provided features supports this.. via get_feature_type() and then typecasting
 HeikoS2	lambday: ok I see
 HeikoS2	lambday: ok that seems reasonable
 HeikoS2	mmmh
 HeikoS2	supports_features or something
 lambday	HeikoS2: umm... that's confusing, no?
 lambday	HeikoS2: anyway.. ttyl when you're free :)
 HeikoS2	lambday: yeah sorry, i am very open to suggestions, so let me know your thoughts
 lambday	HeikoS2: does it make sense to put those features that supports num_features under another subclass of CFeatures, then feature selection works with that class instead
 lambday	HeikoS2: otherwise with typecasting the whole thing sounds horrible!
 HeikoS2	lambday: yeah that would be a good idea
 lambday	for each of the classes (which supports num_features) we gotta use casted features!
 HeikoS2	lambday: in fact, this might also be good for numerical features
 HeikoS2	lambday: maybe this can be the same?
 lambday	HeikoS2: umm.. how about string features?
 lambday	HeikoS2: let me check quickly
 HeikoS2	lambday: what are the variables in string features even?
 HeikoS2	lambday: not clear to me
 lambday	HeikoS2: err... not much idea! may be the letters in a string??
 lambday	sonney2k: ^
 lambday	HeikoS2: there are 10 subclasses of CFeatures which has get_num_features()
 lambday	HeikoS2: I think your supports_features idea is the way to go
 lambday	HeikoS2: but if we can manage a CNumericalFeatures base for these.. then feature selection can work with that!
* lambday thinking
 lambday	do we intend to perform feature selection for features other than numerical features? :/ if not, then in feature selection we can work with CNumericalFeatures only
@wiking	lambday: why not only dotfeatures?
@wiking	i mean there's a very good reason why CFeatures has no get_num_features
 lambday	wiking: yeah I totally agree
 lambday	wiking: but the CDotFeatures class itself doesn't have get_num_features()
@wiking	mmm dig deeper then :P
@wiking	i mean go for a lower class
 lambday	wiking: let me check which subclass of CDotFeatures has this missing
 lambday	wiking: yeah
 lambday	wiking: oh but you think that we can add that SG_WARNING thingi in the CDotFeatures itself, right?
@wiking	no
@wiking	please do not expose an api
@wiking	that has no meaning at a given level
 lambday	wiking: alright.. agreed
 lambday	wiking: so, ideally if we can put all those subclasses of CDotFeatures under another layer of abstraction, say, C<Something>Features, which defines the get_num_features(), then we're fine
 lambday	rest of the CDotFeatures won't have it
@wiking	mmm maybe the abstraction is wrong  yeah
@wiking	and maybe its not the best option to add another abstraction layer
@wiking	but refactor the abstraction
@wiking	this should be investigated
@wiking	but surely having functionX() {SG_NOTIMPLMENTED; } is a very bad approach
 lambday	wiking: I am quickly checking which subclass of CDotFeatures doesn't have get_num_features()... if it turns out that all the subclasses have it, then we can move this one level up to CDotFeatures
@wiking	if it's not implemented, i.e. it has no meaning at a given abstraction class
 lambday	wiking: yeah totally agreee!
@wiking	then it should never be implemented there
 lambday	20 subclasses of CDotFeatures!
 lambday	I'm screwed!

 lambday	wiking: under CDotFeatures, only CDenseFeatures and CSparseFeatures has get_num_features()
 lambday	wiking: does it make sense to put this under a more generic CNumericalFeatures? as in, CDotFeatures <-- CNumericalFeatures <-- CDenseFeatures | CSparseFeatures
 lambday	and then in feature selection, we work with CNumericalFeatures instead?
 lambday	HeikoS2: ^
 lambday	sonney2k: ^
 lambday	although, we will miss streaming dense and streaming sparse with this
@wiking	lambday: the thing is that string features can have that as well no? :)
@wiking	and even more you'd like to have feature selection for stringfeatures as well
 lambday	wiking: ah I see
 lambday	wiking: but string features is not under dot...
 lambday	wiking: so there is no way we can unify this thing
@wiking	there is way :)
@wiking	it's just a quite deep refactor
 lambday	wiking: well, with CStringFeatures, num_features is not defined
 lambday	wiking: I mean, different feature vectors are of different length... how does one does feature selection for this? :-/
 lambday	do*
@wiking	lambday: btw sonney2k has a point...
 lambday	wiking: dense/sparse?
@wiking	y
 lambday	wiking: could you please have a look at the class design?

@wiking	lambday: could u use some webservice for this?
@wiking	lambday: http://asciiflow.com/
 lambday	wiking: checking
 lambday	wiking: ah.. I think it cannot import dia..
 lambday	wiking: wait I am making one from scratch then
@wiking	lambday: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6877121/is-there-a-free-browser-based-uml-modelling-tool
@wiking	check these services then
 lambday	wiking: okies... thanks :)
 lambday	wiking: writing comments are not possible with these! I attached a png also... could you please have a look at that? in case you can't open the dia file
