 blackburn	serialhex: no more floating faces :(
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r6e02faf / src/shogun/preprocessor/KernelLocallyLinearEmbedding.cpp : Fixes for kLLE - http://git.io/2iRxKw
 serialhex	why no more floating faces???
 blackburn	serialhex: they died
 serialhex	died??? what happened blackburn???
 blackburn	ok joke :D
 serialhex	did you kil the floating faces??? :P
 blackburn	I'm now trying to the get intrinsic manifold of promoter data
 serialhex	ok, cool
 blackburn	fancy-mancy-pancy bioinformatics hehe
 serialhex	heh
 blackburn	serialhex: how are you?
 serialhex	good good, and yourself blackburn??
 blackburn	fine, soon starting to studying again
 serialhex	...and wondering what happened to my local branch of shogun... :(
 blackburn	what's up with your branch?
 serialhex	yeah?  classes start on tues for me, what are you taking this simester??
 blackburn	I don't know :D
 serialhex	it's saying there are a *BUNCH* of files that i edited & it's all stuff like: shogun/ui/GUIHMM.h and shogun/base/init.h  and i have no reason to edit those files...
 serialhex	:(
 blackburn	serialhex: hmm try rebase
 serialhex	you dont know!?!?!  you're gonna be studying but you dont know what!?!?
 blackburn	I have fixed warnings in these files
 blackburn	yeah I will study what I have to study
 blackburn	no choice is given heh
 serialhex	niiice :P
 blackburn	I know I have to study experimental design techniques or so
 serialhex	it's weird, it says i have those files staged for commit... but i havnt done that :(
 serialhex	cool cool
 blackburn	java ee but my teacher will free me for that
 blackburn	cause I will be working as java ee developer starting from september, the 5th
 blackburn	well it would be strange to study java ee again :D
 serialhex	really? thats kind of cool!!
 blackburn	yeah I will have to work about 20-30 per week
 blackburn	I hope I will have much time for studies, vodka and shogun
 blackburn	not much, bad word
 blackburn	ehmm
 blackburn	sufficient
 serialhex	yeah, sufficient works better :D
 blackburn	and I have to study some optical informatics or so
 blackburn	some crazy shit I don't want to do
 blackburn	and mathematical physics again
 serialhex	lovely :P
 serialhex	holy crap dude... the shogun repository is ~23MB!!!!
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/promoters-wdk-k10%2C100.png
 blackburn	serialhex: ^ some promoter embedding via kernel LLE I implemented just now
 serialhex	ooh, perdy dots!! :P
 blackburn	different colors are standing for different organisms
 blackburn	I don't know if it is good or not but at least something
 blackburn	with kPCA I've got gaussian cloud
 blackburn	nothing to deal with
 serialhex	so is it like showing diffs in DNA or something?
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	it uses kernel
 blackburn	I used weighted degree kernel with degree of 100
 serialhex	cool
 blackburn	and 150 instances of each organism
 blackburn	so it should be something like underlying manifold of this data
 blackburn	input data is some ACTCGACTTTTCACGAC....
 serialhex	hmm... ok
 blackburn	150*9 strings of length 600
 blackburn	I don't really understand anything hahah
 serialhex	ooh, niiice.... i bet that took a while to compute :P
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	<10s
 blackburn	the most expensive here was to load data
 serialhex	oh, i thought it was 150**9, not *9 :P
 blackburn	ah nooo
 serialhex	yeah... that'd be insane!
 blackburn	I bet it would never do a half of that embedding
 blackburn	hmm the most strange thing for me is that according to the embedding all of the promoters are the same
 blackburn	I should add some crap here and see if it will be farther or so
 blackburn	serialhex: time for sleep, see you :)
 serialhex	ok, nite blackburn

@sonney2k	serialhex, problem is I cannot use CONFIG['sitelibdir']
@sonney2k	serialhex, the prefix that we might want to install to might be different from /usr/local ...
@sonney2k	so I need to set it someow
@sonney2k	serialhex, so ruby -e 'require "mkmf"; CONFIG["sitedir"]="/my/prefix"; puts Config::expand("$(sitelibdir)")' should say sth lilike /my/prefix ...

 blackburn	sonney2k: eeh?!
 blackburn	uh :(
 blackburn	did you fix it?
 blackburn	parallel issue?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	blackburn, it does neither work with mutex nor with spinlocks
 blackburn	I don't know where regression happen
 blackburn	are you sure it is related to locks?
@sonney2k	blackburn,
@sonney2k	#include <shogun/base/init.h>
@sonney2k	#include <shogun/features/Labels.h>
@sonney2k	using namespace shogun;
@sonney2k	int main(int argc, char** argv)
@sonney2k	{
@sonney2k	init_shogun();
@sonney2k	CLabels* l = new CLabels(10);
@sonney2k	exit_shogun();
@sonney2k	return 0;
@sonney2k	}
@sonney2k	this crashes
@sonney2k	well it crashes in the call to CSGObject()
 blackburn	valgrind shows strange error
 blackburn	okay I'll check
 blackburn	modular works..
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	compile yes but no more
 blackburn	python examples works here
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess you should git bisect
 blackburn	I'll disable ref counting
 blackburn	and check
@sonney2k	though I suspect that it is working before the spinlock macro change
@sonney2k	blackburn, good idea
 blackburn	uh a lot of warnings from DynamicObjectArray
 blackburn	when compiling w/o ref counting
@sonney2k	and does it work?
 blackburn	checking
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, disabling ref counting didn't help
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have any idea what caused this?
 blackburn	making git bisect now
 blackburn	okay sgobject things caused this
 blackburn	but why
@sonney2k	blackburn, which commit is it?
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/ed1846562fef047cca1847d16d79dd3ee8092ac2
 blackburn	the problem is that revision is not compiling
 blackburn	I fixed it in the next commit
 blackburn	so probably better that
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/85ce83d0a70ff64fc02c5ef994a761a9995b1de5
@sonney2k	blackburn, but that commit is unrelated
@sonney2k	blackburn, so ed1846562fef047cca1847d16d79dd3ee8092ac2 is the problem?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, why did you change it to not using a ptr?
 blackburn	changed what?
@sonney2k	I mean the &lock instead of lock in the macro?
 blackburn	cause parameter should be ptr
 blackburn	but in sgobject it is instance
@sonney2k	I mean that is not the problem - it is just confusing when the function before was taking ptr's
@sonney2k	that is why I would have kept the ptr
@sonney2k	then one woul PTHREAD_UNLOCK(&m_ref_lock);
 blackburn	yeah may be
 blackburn	but it is not a problem
@sonney2k	I don't see the problem...
 blackburn	i've reverted the commit
 blackburn	will try to run
@sonney2k	blackburn, the other option is to comment parts of the code until it works
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	works now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think it is better to push revert and then commit it then it works
 blackburn	it's kinda bad that shogun is not working now
 blackburn	do you agree?
@sonney2k	yes
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r0020af8 / (src/shogun/base/SGObject.cpp src/shogun/base/SGObject.h):

 CIA-87	shogun: This reverts commit ed1846562fef047cca1847d16d79dd3ee8092ac2. - http://git.io/1qXRAw
 blackburn	sonney2k: interesting thing: libshogun examples can't run cause they don't know anything about PTHREAD_LOCK_T..
 blackburn	I have no idea how to avoid this

 blackburn	sonney2k: should -larpack or so be in params of check.sh of libshogun?
 blackburn	for arpack test being compiled
@sonney2k	blackburn, why should examples know anything about PTHREAD_LOCK_T?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no we need to modify the code then to don't have library calls in the .h file
@sonney2k	blackburn, then this can be avoided
 blackburn	sonney2k: arpack.h have no library calls
 blackburn	but not visible for some reason
 blackburn	can't understand why
@sonney2k	then I don't understand what you mean
 blackburn	I tried to make mathematics_arpack.cpp example
 blackburn	but arpack_dsaeupd_wrap routine 'was not declared'
@sonney2k	blackburn, could it be that you don't include lib/config.h in the file where you define arpack?
 blackburn	hmm I didn't
 blackburn	didn't help :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: any other ideas?
 blackburn	oh I see
 blackburn	wrong order of includes :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, err no
@sonney2k	then some include is missing somewhere
 blackburn	sonney2k: I placed include of config *after* ifdefs
@sonney2k	but lib/config.h must be included first that is right
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, what about the PTHREAD_LOCK_T thing?
@sonney2k	resolved?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw is that perhaps the reason for the crash we were seeing?
* sonney2k tries
@sonney2k	unfortunately not
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can't fix it
@sonney2k	what?
 blackburn	I've reverted sgobject transition
 blackburn	now it uses mutex
 blackburn	when I try to use PTHREAD_LOCK_T there - examples fails
 blackburn	I don't know why
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r80149f4 / (7 files in 3 dirs): Improved and renamed arpack wrapper, added libshogun arpack example - http://git.io/FPkGAQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, I found the problem
@sonney2k	bug in configure script
 blackburn	to which issue is it related?
@sonney2k	blackburn, and only possible because we are doing library calls in .h file
@sonney2k	to the lib/config.h include one and the library calls in .h file one
@sonney2k	I will commit a revert reverted SGObject version with the & replaced soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: so should config.h be included in prior of every HAVE_*?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	ohh
@sonney2k	once per file at most :)
 blackburn	yeah I see..
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course we could avoid this if we had no ifdef HAVE_XXX in a .h file
@sonney2k	but that is not possible
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: so did you manage to make generic lock work in sgobject?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	how?
@sonney2k	blackburn, configure was not writing out the HAVE_PTHREAD to lib/config.h
 blackburn	oh
@sonney2k	but only setting it in DEFINES (arguments passed to g++)
@sonney2k	same for SPINLOCKS btw
 blackburn	my bug :D
 blackburn	hmm but spinlock is yours
@sonney2k	I copy pasted from PTHREAD :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: your email is wonderful thing to start a day with haha :D
 blackburn	btw I had a dream I killed someone and got email What have you done :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I spend all my spare time on hunting this bug today too - so you are not alone...
 blackburn	sonney2k: how soon will you receive new computer?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea - hopefully this week
 CIA-87	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra030b01 / (9 files): Added necessary include of config header to preprocessors - http://git.io/PZFclQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've got this picture for the promoter data: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/pr.png
 blackburn	have you any ideas what axes could mean? :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, for one I would expect GC frequency
 blackburn	sonney2k: hm! I should check, thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about storing consts this way? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/876909b8ef40dc42c7beb543cd6a9b4de0dde89f#L0R101
 blackburn	it is used in java commonly
-!- heiko [~heiko@541D5B0C.cm-5-6b.dynamic.ziggo.nl] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	for examples I can do something like
 blackburn	ltsa = LocalTangentSpaceAlignment()
 blackburn	ltsa.set_target_dim(ltsa.AUTO_TARGET_DIM)
 blackburn	without any import except ltsa itself
 blackburn	for example*
@sonney2k	blackburn, shouldn't it be static const int32_t AUTO_TARGET_DIM ?
 blackburn	what is the difference?

 blackburn	sonney2k: so what are the tasks we have to finish?
 blackburn	there should be <50 warning now, seems various examples is what we have to do
@sonney2k	blackburn, get the test suite to work fix remaining warnings, fix / port examples for all new languages, get installer to work for new languages, write  / update make release script
@sonney2k	I am working on the install scripts currently
@sonney2k	blackburn, would be good if you could get the warnings down to 0
 blackburn	hmm okay
@sonney2k	(and you don't need a buildbot for that - just compile python_modular and you see all the many)
 blackburn	sure but I usually disable doxygen hah
@sonney2k	I never do
@sonney2k	I guess I like to suffer
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw it doesn't even compile here w/ doxygen on
 blackburn	ehh why?
@sonney2k	blackburn, some unicode errror you\u22c5' ?
@sonney2k	no idea what that could be
 blackburn	where?
@sonney2k	no idea
 blackburn	okay will try to detec
 blackburn	t
@sonney2k	blackburn, found it
@sonney2k	was ?
@sonney2k	and in your commit

@sonney2k	I was first trying to remove the dust from my display but it is an actual unicode character pixel ?
@sonney2k	heiko, how is it going?
 heiko	sonney2k, hi, the stuff in running, no more errors
 heiko	but it leaks
@sonney2k	the first sentence is exactly what I wanted to hear :)
 heiko	there are some minor memory leaks which i hope to fix soon :)
 heiko	Though its kind of complicated to add a migration now, but you will see. Let me just hunt down the memory leaks .)
@sonney2k	heiko, I guess you will be just in time for when the new buildbot arrives
 heiko	when will that be? :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen doc in vojtech's toolkit?
@sonney2k	no - did you?
 blackburn	I want similar
@sonney2k	heiko, somewhen this week
@sonney2k	blackburn, does it contain formulas?
 blackburn	it contains short description
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	and it is in latex -> pdf
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but then jsut write formulas
@sonney2k	I did...
 blackburn	no, I want to choke seeing doxygen formulas
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/classshogun_1_1CKernelMachine.html
 blackburn	don't like it
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you want to spend all your life keeping the documentation up-to-date - feel free
@sonney2k	blackburn, or write a book even
 blackburn	why? do methods change?
@sonney2k	all the time
 blackburn	ehm
@sonney2k	and no one updates documentation
 blackburn	e.g. LLE stays LLE
@sonney2k	it is already tough enough to update the doc inside the source code
 blackburn	no chance it will be changed
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha - like PCACut you mean?
@sonney2k	or Classifier
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	not the API doc
@sonney2k	blackburn, the method itself?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	for that a pointer to a paper is all that is needed
 blackburn	everytime I see vojtech's toolbox description I cry and want the same for shogun :(
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, no one wants to write documentation - so if you don't do it it will always be like this
 blackburn	possibly it is because I'm a latex fan

@sonney2k	serialhex proof-read it?
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	heiko, this week I hope
 heiko	sonney2k, ok
@sonney2k	heiko, my machine is just too unstable ...
@sonney2k	so I bought a new one
 heiko	ok, cool that we got a new one then
 heiko	will you install it at home?
@sonney2k	heiko, now with 16G of memory - btw whose price dropped to 52 EUR now
 heiko	oh no, i paid too much :)

@sonney2k	go guys go!
 blackburn	10 to go
 heiko	sonney2k, I will open a pull request so that you can read a bit what I did.
 heiko	I will polish it a bit more, don't yet merge
@sonney2k	heiko, ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw regarding documentation - I had a look at what you all wrote. I think it really needs some improvement in the header: like formula of the problem that is to be solved and when it is most useful to use this method plus a pointer to a paper.
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you kidding? we will never finish if I writing true doc
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is a true doc?
 blackburn	with formulas, etc
 blackburn	papers
 blackburn	I will improve doc but writing all of it now - it is impossible
 blackburn	sonney2k: or what do you mean?
 blackburn	the whole shogun or my preprocs?
 blackburn	if the whole shogun ^
@sonney2k	I didn't say that you have to do it *now* - I said that documentation is worse than average - which is e.g.  http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/classshogun_1_1CSVM.html
 blackburn	yeah sure we have worst doc ever
@sonney2k	not true
@sonney2k	we don't have a book or tutorial
@sonney2k	it is more like a reference for someone who knows about ML
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	2 warnings left
@sonney2k	blackburn, writing a tutorial style book for the methods inside of shogun is like 1000 pages
@sonney2k	good luck when attempting that
 blackburn	calm down I don't want to write it
@sonney2k	blackburn, you wine all the time
