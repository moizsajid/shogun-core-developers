 kendricktan	Hello
 kendricktan	I'm a high school student in Australia and i'm very interested in machine learning, i stumbled upon your github and i'm really interested in contributing
 kendricktan	however my knowledge in maths is rather limited, but i've done topics such as the PCA algorithm for my maths exploration
 kendricktan	and was just wondering what kinda of courses should i go through to be able to fully grasp the complexity of shogun?
 kendricktan	cheers :-)
