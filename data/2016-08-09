@wiking	c4goldsw, sup?
 c4goldsw	Hey, I have a question.
 c4goldsw	How on earth do I use a dynamic library?
 c4goldsw	specifically, libshogun.so?
@wiking	where
@wiking	inwhat?
@wiking	i
@wiking	g++ -o example example.cpp -lshogun
 c4goldsw	Just so I can use Shogun outside of shogun
@wiking	if libshogun is installed in ld.conf paths
@wiking	if not
@wiking	then you do -L<path where libshogun is installed> -lshogun
 c4goldsw	Great, thank you!
@wiking	nw
 c4goldsw	wiking: when trying to compile this (https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/c8c55fbc784fc6b5d1bcc44b10f4b8ce), I get a no such file or directory error for the headers.  How do I import a specific class?
 c4goldsw	https://gist.github.com/c4goldsw/c8c55fbc784fc6b5d1bcc44b10f4b8ce
@wiking	ah
@wiking	for the headers
@wiking	you need to specify where the headers are installed
@wiking	if it's not in standard place
@wiking	so like -I<path where the headers are installed>
 c4goldsw	Aren't they meant to be within the library?  Or is that only for static libraries?
@wiking	?
 c4goldsw	Never mind, but
@wiking	so
@wiking	after you create any library
@wiking	usually you do
@wiking	make install
@wiking	that'll copy
@wiking	headers and library
@wiking	to a given prexi
@wiking	*prefix
@wiking	prefix can be anything
@wiking	it could be /usr/local
@wiking	or /opt
@wiking	but then
@wiking	the headers will be copied to <prefix>/include
@wiking	the libraries to <prefix>/lib
@wiking	if the prefix is not something that is in a standard place
@wiking	you have to specify both the -I which is the header path
@wiking	and the -L which is the librayr path
 c4goldsw	So for DenseFeatures, it would be -l <prefix>/shogun/features/DenseLabels.h ?
 c4goldsw	For instance.
@wiking	nono
@wiking	since those are paths in the include
@wiking	so you just have to define where the shogun/* is
@wiking	i.e.
@wiking	-I<prefix>/include
 c4goldsw	That makes sense - I'll try that out
 c4goldsw	afk
