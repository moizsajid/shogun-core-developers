 Saurabh7	hey kislay ,
 kislay	hey Saurabh7
 Saurabh7	kislay,  any idea how big shogun-data is?
 Saurabh7	its taking forever to update here :)
 kislay	385 MB...
-!- khalednasr [~k.nasr92@41.69.198.3] has joined #shogun
 kislay	last time I downloaded it, it was this much
 Saurabh7	kislay, thanks
 Saurabh7	have sh*t connection here
 kislay	Saurabh7, where are you?
 Saurabh7	ah, middle of nowhere right now :)
 Saurabh7	native place
 kislay	haha :D
 kislay	where is it?
 Saurabh7	west coast
 Saurabh7	ratnagiri
 kislay	maharashtra right
 Saurabh7	yeah, oh , i meant east :P

 kislay	hey iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	sup kislay
 kislay	I am having a trouble. I have added OpenCV as a option in CmakeLists.txt.
 kislay	now all my unit tests are working fine when I add a -HAVE_OPENCV=on flG
 kislay	at the time of building
 kislay	but my normal builds are failing.
 kislay	iglesiasg,  So the point is...what to do to make those opencv unittests run only when the HAVE_OPENCV flag is enabled.
@iglesiasg	kislay, I guess you wrote already an ifdef
 kislay	yup
 kislay	thats done...
@iglesiasg	kislay, so for reason what's not working properly is the cmake part
@iglesiasg	kislay, agree?
 kislay	yes
 kislay	I am somewhere messing with the includes!
@iglesiasg	kislay, mm hold on -- the includes?
@iglesiasg	kislay, have you checked if the HAVE_OPENCV flag gets the right value?
 kislay	yes. I checked it. It gets 1.
@iglesiasg	kislay, and when you don't use it, is it 0?
 kislay	I didn't check this!!
 kislay	ok. I see. hey one more thing...whats use of this '#include <shogun/lib/config.h>'
 kislay	it's always at the top of all the headers I see...and it sets the value of HAVE_EIGEN3 and dependencies to 1
@iglesiasg	kislay, yep
@iglesiasg	kislay, optional libraries rather than dependencies, I think
 kislay	But, if eigen3 is not in the machine, then HAVE_EIGEN3 should never be set
 kislay	but if my theory is correct...
 kislay	then we are setting it everytime
@iglesiasg	kislay, that file should be refreshed after doing cmake
@iglesiasg	I think
 kislay	Nope. That file looks more hardcoded ...
@iglesiasg	hmm
 kislay	I edited that file and added HAVE_OPENCV =1
 kislay	now I do a #include <shogun/lib/config.h>
@iglesiasg	kislay, that file is in .gitignore
 kislay	the #ifdef HAVE_OPENCV
@iglesiasg	kislay, the fact that it is in .gitignore makes me believe even more that it should be generated with cmake
@iglesiasg	kislay, but let me try it out
 kislay	yeah, It should be system generated... doing a #include<shogun/lib/config.h> and then a #ifdef HAVE_OPENCV with the config.h file editable is foolishness. We are not achieving anything...
 kislay	iglesiasg, wow
 kislay	iglesiasg, i checked it.
@iglesiasg	kislay, what is it?
 kislay	it comments out those lines which have #define for optional lib not present!!!
 kislay	iglesiasg, well...I don't know if I drew the right conclusion though..
@iglesiasg	kislay, yes. I just tried something with doxygen
 kislay	iglesiasg, so?
@iglesiasg	kislay, if it is not installed, then /* #undef HAVE_DOXYGEN */ is written. Otherwise, #define HAVE_DOXYGEN 1 appears
 kislay	haha
 kislay	awesome
@iglesiasg	kislay, this happens in the configure step of cmake (I do configure + generate in two steps using ccmake)
@iglesiasg	kislay, not sure if you are being ironic :-P
 kislay	Never knew things like these are hidden in the vaults of shogun :)
@iglesiasg	kislay, so, I think that the question is
@iglesiasg	kislay, what do you need / how do you want to do with OpenCV?
 kislay	I need to convert the mat data structure which shogun uses to ours densefeatures
@iglesiasg	kislay, if installed in the system then is used OR depending on a flag given
@iglesiasg	kislay, the second seems more flexible to me at first sight
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.200.177.194] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 kislay	both..
 kislay	the user need to have it
 kislay	+ the user should make the flag ON
@iglesiasg	kislay, ok. Have you seen something that is done like that already in our CMakeLists?
 kislay	yeah. I have seen it very thoroughly
 kislay	I got it merged even
@iglesiasg	kislay, I didn't mean that...
@iglesiasg	kislay, I meant if you have seen any other library that is handled like that already by our CMakeLists
 kislay	I followed EIGEN3
 kislay	very much like that
@iglesiasg	kislay, then, as you may noted, EIGEN3 is not as you just said
@iglesiasg	<kislay> the user need to have it
@iglesiasg	<kislay> + the user should make the flag ON
@iglesiasg	EIGEN3 is not handled like that
@iglesiasg	If I am not wrong
 kislay	yes, you are correct
 kislay	we need to have it
 kislay	no flags required
 kislay	it automatically gets included..
 kislay	right!!
@iglesiasg	so.. we go back to the question before
@iglesiasg	how do you want to do it
 kislay	kevin wanted it be like we do with -DPythonModular=ON.
 kislay	So, I would have liked it when we go for the flag
@iglesiasg	kislay, all right. To make it makes more sense like that too
@iglesiasg	kislay, I agree. Then you can probably draw inspiration from the Eigen part, but that is not exactly what you will want to do
 kislay	yes yes
@iglesiasg	kislay, I suggest you to check as well how we are doing it with CCACHE
 kislay	ok
@iglesiasg	kislay, I know that for that one we allow to do something like ENABLE_CCACHE=OFF
 kislay	ah! I see.
 kislay	I get it
@iglesiasg	kislay, awesome ;-) Good luck with it!
 kislay	Actually I followed the PythonModular lib to get the flag on/off. It's same as ccache..but the difference is just that Python interface is default OFF and CCache is On
 kislay	it all makes sense :)
@iglesiasg	g8
 kislay	thanks. I will see it then
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, hello hello
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: how is it going? :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, good, can't complain. What about you?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: quite ok :)
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@27.116.52.254] has left #shogun ["Leaving"]
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what are you up to this weekend?
-!- kislay [~Abhijeet@27.116.52.254] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: polishing thesis :D
@iglesiasg	exciting :P
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: for sure
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: e.g. I made a mistake in thesis' title :D
 lisitsyn	forgot a word
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, haha let it be without it
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it was already settled in some document so need to fix :D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, how would it translate to English?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ehmm like 'research and development of inductive model transfer in pattern recognition'
@iglesiasg	all right!
@iglesiasg	it sounds fancy :)
 lisitsyn	chicken chicken chicken chicken
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I map data with LTSA and pray my domains are not apart anymore
 lisitsyn	domain adaptation!
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken
 lisitsyn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_-1d9OSdk
@iglesiasg	haha pray
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes that's map&pray approach
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: similar to the 'construct deep neural network and pray' one
 lisitsyn	though latter works :D

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hey
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I've been playing around with viennacl a little bit
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	what can you say about it?
 khalednasr	turns out it doesn't support random number generation :(
 lisitsyn	hmm
 lisitsyn	well we can extend it in quite a few ways
 lisitsyn	with custom kernels
 khalednasr	yeah I guess
 khalednasr	I know almost nothing about random number generators though
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: doesn't opencl have anything on it?
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: I was looking at your PR
 khalednasr	It doesn't have any generators out of the box
 lisitsyn	we need to summon heiko or wiking in the thread :D
 lisitsyn	to make sure it follows the way other developers think is good
 khalednasr	you mean the PR?
 lisitsyn	yes
 khalednasr	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	I mean it is kind of specialized IO
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, well, summon them! :D
 lisitsyn	yeah
