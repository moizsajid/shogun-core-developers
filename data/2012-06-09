@sonney2k	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	yeap
@sonney2k	I have a compile error related to %template(IntStdVector) vector<int32_t>;
@sonney2k	in java_modular
 blackburn	whoops
@sonney2k	I think it needs SERIALIZABLE_DUMMY(vector<int32_t>);
 blackburn	let me check if we really need that
@sonney2k	but adding that doesn't work
@sonney2k	I mean it doesn't change a thing
 blackburn	I merged chris' code w/o many changes
 blackburn	sonney2k: we can remove that!
 blackburn	I'll do
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean we no longer need std::vector in interfaces?
@sonney2k	cool
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	I thought we need but we don't
@sonney2k	die die std::vector :P
@sonney2k	let me see if that fixes the problem here...
 blackburn	I realize I need to move recently added liblinear to transfer
@sonney2k	you added chris' MTL one?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	however patches have gone flatten :(
@sonney2k	i guess it is currently in cliblinear?
 blackburn	no different class
@sonney2k	patches?
 blackburn	yes he send me patches to merge
@sonney2k	ahh ok
 blackburn	I'll undo not required changes now
@sonney2k	I have no idea what you are talking about
 blackburn	stl added stuff
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw can you please merge gsomix' stuff
 blackburn	argh sure - I thought it will be a new PR and was waiting for mail
@sonney2k	gsomix never mentions that a patch is final or ready ... everything is always WIP
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, today I enjoyed swimming in the sea
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	12-13 C though
 blackburn	did you visit england?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	you tend to swim far
 blackburn	12-13C? argh not any warm
@sonney2k	haha
@sonney2k	it is so damn cold that I could not swim with face in water
@sonney2k	it did hurt like needles put in your head
 blackburn	why didn't you visit some +20C place?
 emrecelikten	e.g. Turkey
 emrecelikten	:P
@sonney2k	not really a car ride away :)
@sonney2k	2-3hr car ride I mean :)
@sonney2k	alright I better sleep now - long journey back tomorrow!

 blackburn	pluskid: you have something wrond with your productivity - it is too high :D
 pluskid	blackburn: I have long time no commits
 pluskid	so those are accumulated...
 blackburn	heh yeah
 blackburn	let me try to review that
 pluskid	thanks!
 pluskid	actually, I'm having some trouble with the shogun Vw, so have to use LibLinear
 pluskid	maybe I could try to figure out the problem (if any) with shogun Vw some time later
 blackburn	you changed much things in liblinear
 blackburn	why so?
 pluskid	blackburn: just refactoring
 blackburn	ok
 pluskid	blackburn: to allow training example by example
 blackburn	sure

 n4nd0	sonney2k: around?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	whats up?
 n4nd0	I have been stuck here with a problem the whole day and I don't manage to solve it :S
 n4nd0	I cannot compile any of the examples under libshogun
@sonney2k	which is?
 n4nd0	is a problem of mine, locally
 n4nd0	when I try to compile anything in libshogun I get
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 n4nd0	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
@sonney2k	maybe not
 n4nd0	make: *** [basic_minimal] Error 1
@sonney2k	ohh
 n4nd0	I have tried with *a lot* of different things but I have not succeeded
@sonney2k	n4nd0, does mosek come with its own set of standard system libraries?
 n4nd0	this is the way one compiles programs with mosek
 n4nd0	I hope it answers your question
 n4nd0	gcc examp/lo1.c -o lo1 -I h/ -L platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek -pthread -lc -ldl -lm
 n4nd0	both h/ and platform/linux32x86/bin/ are mosek directories
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	what I mean is there might be system libraries in the mosek dirs conflicting with the ones installed to your system
 n4nd0	it can be a possibility
 n4nd0	but the one that gives the problem, limiomp5.so is not in my system I think
 n4nd0	it's just from mosek
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	certainly it is not limiomp's fault
@sonney2k	but maybe your have a different libpthread in mosek dirs somewhere?
 n4nd0	in my mosek directory
 n4nd0	find | grep thread returns nothing
@sonney2k	n4nd0, other idea is to use -lpthread
@sonney2k	at the end
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah
 n4nd0	that's what I have been trying during the day
 n4nd0	lpthread compiling with shogun
 n4nd0	compiling the examples
 n4nd0	etc
 n4nd0	at the end you mean like the last thing in the line I showed you?
@sonney2k	yes
 n4nd0	c++ -O0 -g -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/atlas basic_minimal.cpp -lshogun -L/usr/lib  -lpthread
 n4nd0	fails in the same way
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and if you put the -L platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek to the end?
 n4nd0	c++ -O0 -g -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/atlas basic_minimal.cpp -lshogun -L/usr/lib -lpthread -L/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek
 n4nd0	fails too

-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0, in the same way or what?
 n4nd0	note that basic_minimal.cpp doesn't use anything from mosek at all
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, same error
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am lost - you attempt to compile the shogun example right?
@sonney2k	so w/o the mosek stuff it compiles right?
 n4nd0	the error happens with all the examples
 n4nd0	the mosek stuff I am using is to build shogun
 n4nd0	I use a USE_MOSEK and include the libraries it needs
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no I mean if you don't use mosek link flags
@sonney2k	compile flags
 n4nd0	I don't know right now since I have not tried
 n4nd0	but probably the error would disappear
@sonney2k	then please try if  c++ -O0 -g -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/atlas basic_minimal.cpp -lshogun -L/usr/lib -lpthread works
 n4nd0	since it comes from a file in mosek
 n4nd0	same error with this last one
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 n4nd0	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
@sonney2k	with which command?
 n4nd0	with the last one you told me
 n4nd0	I paste again
 n4nd0	c++ -O0 -g -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/atlas basic_minimal.cpp -lshogun -L/usr/lib -lpthread
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 n4nd0	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what is the output of which c++ ?
@sonney2k	and c++ -v
 n4nd0	which c++
 n4nd0	/usr/bin/c++
 n4nd0	c++ -v

 n4nd0	extern "C" {

@sonney2k	n4nd0, no other includes?
 n4nd0	there is a #include <stdio.h>
 n4nd0	I didn't surround that one
@sonney2k	that's it?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	I guess that the file mosek.h contains a bunch of other includes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and if you compile with g++ lo1.c -o lo1 -I ../../platform/linux32x86/h/ -L ../../platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek -lm
 n4nd0	still with the extern there right?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, and if you do this with g++ instead?
 n4nd0	and the executable runs fine
 n4nd0	with g++ it fails
 n4nd0	what does this mean?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, can you install a different version of g++
@sonney2k	?
 n4nd0	g++ --version
 n4nd0	g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1
 n4nd0	sure, how should I do it?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, apt-cache search 'g++' | grep ^g++
 n4nd0	should I move to an older version?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, which ones are available?
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/vaxg7
 n4nd0	and what I have is
 n4nd0	dpkg -l | grep g++
 n4nd0	ii  g++                                            4:4.6.1-2ubuntu5                           GNU C++ compiler
 n4nd0	ii  g++-4.5                                        4.5.3-9ubuntu1                             The GNU C++ compiler
 n4nd0	ii  g++-4.6                                        4.6.1-9ubuntu3                             GNU C++ compiler
@sonney2k	well then install g++-4.5
@sonney2k	ahh you have it alrady
@sonney2k	then g++-4.5 <cmdline above>
 n4nd0	is it going to be any problem wiht the version I have in my system right now?
 n4nd0	I mean, is the installation going to overwrite the current?
@sonney2k	you have it installed already
@sonney2k	so just run the cmd
 n4nd0	ah all right
 n4nd0	g++-4.5 lo1.c -o lo1 -I ../../platform/linux32x86/h/ -L ../../platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lmosek -lm -lpthread
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 n4nd0	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
 n4nd0	and with another version, g++-4.6, it happens the same
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what happens if you rename lol.c -> lol.cpp
@sonney2k	any change?
 n4nd0	same error, using all the different versions, g++, g++-4.5 and g++-4.6
@sonney2k	well no idea then - continue with clang++
@sonney2k	shogun works with that too so no problem
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	but do you think this could be a problem later?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do we have a choice?
 n4nd0	I don't know if it pays off trying to solve the problem with g++
 n4nd0	sonney2k: in any case, thank you very much for your help!
 n4nd0	hopefully, I will be able to continue with the multiclass example for so using clang++ :)
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	what is problemyou have?
 n4nd0	blackburn: sorry man, I am having dinner now
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have an undefined reference that shows up when compiling my examples in libshogun when I configure shogun to use with mosek
 n4nd0	I will be back later
 gsomix	sonney2k, moin. how are you?
@sonney2k	gsomix, back home :)
 gsomix	\(^^)/
@sonney2k	gsomix, so what was the problem our first directorkernel user was having?
 gsomix	sonney2k, python don't know about polymorphism
 gsomix	get_lhs returns CFeatures.
 gsomix	and we haven't methods to covert CFeatures to CDenseFeatures for example
 gsomix	*convert
@sonney2k	gsomix, that's all?
 gsomix	that's all
-!- emrecelikten [~Anubis@176.40.238.218] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	ah
 gsomix	forgot
@sonney2k	I mean the simple fix is to add some conversion methods that do dyn_casts
 gsomix	I forgot about same virtual method
@sonney2k	gsomix, did you fix the virtual method stuff?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
 gsomix	sonney2k, I think conversion by swig side is better
@sonney2k	the other idea yes
@sonney2k	in the same way I did the hack / fix for apply()
@sonney2k	gsomix, so with %ignore / an casts
@sonney2k	gsomix, mind doing that?
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw how far are you with the other director classes?
 gsomix	sonney2k, mmm, director linear machines are not ready yet.
@sonney2k	because once these are done I would suggest continuing with dotfeatures
@sonney2k	gsomix, whats the problem with linear machines?
 blackburn	bloody stalin^W soeren
 gsomix	sonney2k, no problems.
@sonney2k	blackburn, well look at how much pluskid does :D
 blackburn	much more than we all in total
 gsomix	.___.
@sonney2k	blackburn, he is working full time :)
 blackburn	stop these insinuations :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, just stop sleeping and you will be like pluskid :D
 blackburn	I do not sleep I slep
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, slep faster :)
 blackburn	one more word and I'll start commiting some useless code to look productive :D
@sonney2k	hehe
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw it took a while to detect an error with mkl and linadd
 blackburn	hmm sonney2k did you ever try to pull from branch without pull request?
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	works

@sonney2k	blackburn, what error with mkl/linadd?
@sonney2k	(i am the author of both...)
 blackburn	sonney2k: didn't you read mailing list?
 blackburn	mkl regression with linadd doesn't work
@sonney2k	I only read things very superficially
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can point to 'wrong' method
@sonney2k	did you fix things?
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	I did not managed to
 blackburn	suggested Kyle to turn off linadd
@sonney2k	blackburn, basically the problem is that svr is translated to svc
@sonney2k	with twice the number of examples
 blackburn	yes yes and I reduced it by 2
 blackburn	that helped to avoid segfaults
 blackburn	but not to fix things
@sonney2k	where the 'copy' is just the same examples with label sign flipped to keep things in the eps-tube
@sonney2k	shogun's kernel function has some regression_hack flag iirc
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you mean by  I reduced it by 2
 blackburn	sonney2k: a sec
 blackburn	sonney2k: shogun/regression/svr/SVRLight.cpp:576
@sonney2k	blackburn, actually the right fix would be to do a index modulo num_real_examples
 blackburn	can you do that?
@sonney2k	actually the funxtion to call is regression_fix_index(i)
@sonney2k	to everything where the error occurs
 blackburn	bad criterion
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand the num=totdoc/2;
@sonney2k	isn't num the nubmer of kernels?
 blackburn	sonney2k: was number of examples twice
@sonney2k	anyway in which line is the error?
@sonney2k	I mean valgrind error/segfault
 blackburn	609
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can tell you how to reproduce
 blackburn	580 remove /2
 blackburn	and run mkl_linadd_regression.py in python modular
 blackburn	should be a nuclear blast
@sonney2k	blackburn, did we have this example before?
 blackburn	no we don't, yes I have added it for that
 blackburn	intention is to remove that example once the problem is fixed
@sonney2k	bugs in the crappiest code ever are sooo hard to fix
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: it was pretty hard to detect it
 blackburn	sonney2k: have cited you 3 times :D
 blackburn	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/ml/thesis.pdf
 gsomix	blackburn, where is my topology? :)
 blackburn	argh

 gsomix	blackburn, :}
 blackburn	germany scored to 1-0
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you test if the 'fix' works
 blackburn	you can
@sonney2k	I am having problems to test anything currently
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	compiling
@sonney2k	somehow atlas is b0rken here so I have 100% segfault guarantee
 blackburn	hah
 n4nd0	blackburn: congrats for the match yesterday btw!
 blackburn	hah thanks that was pretty cool
 n4nd0	blackburn: I didn't watch the match actually
 n4nd0	I am half-watching Germany now
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you like football?
 blackburn	yeah same shit
 n4nd0	gsomix: congrats for you too :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: tomorrow is the day for Spain, we'll see what they do
 blackburn	vs ?
 n4nd0	Italy
 blackburn	ohh
 n4nd0	I support this year Sweden though :P
 blackburn	hahah
 gsomix	n4nd0, wut? I don't like a football. :]
 gsomix	but tnx
 blackburn	ibra!
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	yeah ...
 n4nd0	you know he played in Barcelona, I don't like him that much haha
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	that was badd
 n4nd0	noooo!
 n4nd0	I have done my first test for the so framework
 n4nd0	MOSEK Error 1011     : The problem has 10000 variable(s) but the license allows only 300 variable(s) for feature 'PTS'.

 blackburn	hahaha
@sonney2k	blackburn, did it work?
 blackburn	yes I think so
@sonney2k	yay :)
@sonney2k	hurray atlas compiled
@sonney2k	now I can finally run things again
@sonney2k	n4nd0, welcome to the world of proprietary software
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw do you have more time now?
 blackburn	more than?
@sonney2k	I mean your thesis is done - thanks for the citations btw
@sonney2k	-inf :D
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	getting into faster pace
@sonney2k	it would be nice to have gmm back in shogun ...
 blackburn	hahah
@sonney2k	blackburn, well ask alesis :D
@sonney2k	maybe he cares
@sonney2k	hmmhh all multiclass stuff is broken in current git
 blackburn	again? argh
 blackburn	I'll fix
 blackburn	sonney2k: pluskid's commit ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: MulticlassMachine -> DecompositionMulticlassMachine?
 blackburn	ah nevermind too complex

@sonney2k	blackburn, what did he do?
 blackburn	sonney2k: introduced new class
 blackburn	between multiclassmachine and machine
@sonney2k	and we have a basemulticlassmachien now...
 blackburn	yes
 gsomix	good night guys
 blackburn	nite
@sonney2k	what is this for?
 blackburn	sonney2k: just to store machines
 blackburn	things we have in multiclassmachine are too specialized to decomposition
 blackburn	tree stuff works in a slightly different way
@sonney2k	nite gsomix
@sonney2k	n4nd0, which license do you use btw
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for mosek I mean
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@95.67.170.23] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]

 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	sonney2k: do not do fixes I am working on :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw have you seen the CMath split up?
@sonney2k	can you live with it?
@sonney2k	I know that you didn't want vector functions to be in SGVector
 blackburn	hah yeah I can but I do not really like having operations in SGVector
 blackburn	especially that you have to
 blackburn	SGVector<float64_t>::dot
 CIA-9	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb979aae / (3 files in 2 dirs): fix fisher2x3 example and include statistics in maths module - http://git.io/5dEeUA
 blackburn	I'd like LinearAlgebra or so more
@sonney2k	blackburn, well - either we have templated fucntions or templated classes
 blackburn	my main concern
@sonney2k	I am much more concerned about a proper naming scheme
 blackburn	SGVector functions work with float64_t* and etc
 blackburn	not with vectors
 blackburn	naming scheme of?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	<blackburn> naming scheme of?
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> for example when we have
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> x.add(y)
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> (x and y being SGVectors)
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> for x + y
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> and add(doulbe* x, int x_len, double* y, int y_len)
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> should one be called just 'add'
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> and the other add_vector or add_<what???>
@sonney2k	(got disconnected...)
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	but first is
 blackburn	x.add(y)
 blackburn	and second is
 blackburn	SGVector::add
 blackburn	different methods
@sonney2k	sure one is static one is not
@sonney2k	still I want to avoid the confusion by giving it a proper name
 blackburn	I have no opinion on that actually
@sonney2k	then I will wait for heiko :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have a license that wiking gave me, I don't know of what type it is
@sonney2k	let me ask some contact in mosek if we can have a 'deal'
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thank you :)
 blackburn	I do not crack matlab
