@HeikoS	wiking: hahah thats hilarious!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: heya
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: back to the uk?
@lisitsyn	wiking: I recognize some sightings there :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes I am
@HeikoS	what do you recognize? :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: uhhm some things
@lisitsyn	that's berlin as I can see :D
@lisitsyn	I do not remember any street names :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so how it was?
@lisitsyn	your california trip :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: berlin?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the california trip was just amazing!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah I am pretty sure some places are
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: really liked SF this time, as we had some time to explore
@HeikoS	I dont get this berlin thing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: 2:06
@lisitsyn	uhhm vimeo doesn't let me get a link with time

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah I see
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	of course
@HeikoS	sorry
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	np
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you should be at the summit next year
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: was really cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: lots of good ideas emerged between the 3 of us
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: uhhmm we can try
@lisitsyn	I'd like to settle down for a few years I think so that must be possible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: where do you want to settle?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well current place moscow
@lisitsyn	however it looks like london would be cool :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it is amazing here!
@HeikoS	bit stressful maybe ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: like big city? ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	rent, lifestyle etc
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: then moscow is bigger :D
@lisitsyn	yeah that's the thing I am really used to
@lisitsyn	I like big cities
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: russians seem to be tougher than me anyways, so youll probably be fine :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: haha
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: moscow's cost of living and salaries are like x2 comparing to other places here
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: similar here
@lisitsyn	so yeah I am used to that :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hows the release going btw?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: zero help from me for some reason but I can help today/tomorrow
@HeikoS	for soe reason? haha :)
@lisitsyn	yeah I was in 24/7 work mode
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah would be good to push this out soon
@lisitsyn	trying to beat criteo
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think lately I've been working like 1.5x of what I am supposed to do
@lisitsyn	hopefully this going to slow down
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ug really
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: tough
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: usual state of mind here ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am enjoying that actually
@lisitsyn	but the thing is this way I won't be promoting shogun and myself :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah! btw
@lisitsyn	I was writing a blog post about some thing - let me explain and maybe you could tell me whether it is useful
@lisitsyn	just imagine you have a function f1(...) that takes some arguments
@lisitsyn	and you wanna refactor it
@lisitsyn	you call the new function f2(...) with the same declaration
@lisitsyn	I have an idea how to do:
@lisitsyn	compare(f1,f2);
@HeikoS	compare?
@HeikoS	what do you mean?
@lisitsyn	it runs various combinations of arguments and tells you whether the behaviour changed
@HeikoS	haha
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you know what that problem is called?
@lisitsyn	nope
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: one can proof that no computer can ever solve this problem
@lisitsyn	I'd be deeply offended if you say unit tests
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	no
@HeikoS	its non computable
@lisitsyn	I know about it
@HeikoS	no but yeah
@HeikoS	I get it
@HeikoS	for a fixed set of parameters, compare
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	null, 0, positive
@lisitsyn	negative
@lisitsyn	etc
@HeikoS	well unit tests right?
@lisitsyn	just for error checks
@lisitsyn	no
@HeikoS	but=
@lisitsyn	you won't write unit tests
@HeikoS	?
@lisitsyn	for that :D
@HeikoS	so what else?
@lisitsyn	I mean it is too detailed to be handled in unit tests
@lisitsyn	you just want to know whether it acts the same way yet
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	mmmh
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so the question is whether you can imagine that useful
@HeikoS	I think that might be useful, and I see that its somehow less strong (and work) than a unit test
@lisitsyn	it comes from my head so I do find it useful but I can be really really wrong :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but I am not sure thats what one *should* do
@lisitsyn	yeah absolutely
@lisitsyn	one use case I can think of
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: rather write a test and be explicit
@lisitsyn	is legacy stuff
@lisitsyn	I mean you get code from john langford
@lisitsyn	and you microtest your new functions
@lisitsyn	because it is written with a mix of strcmp and classes :D
@lisitsyn	you want it to be less verbose etc
@lisitsyn	okay I'll explain it then and may be someone would find it useful
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I've been working with VW lately btw
@lisitsyn	it's a trap! :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I will talk to john langford on thursday on skype
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: about gsoc project jointly
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: wanna be involved?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm not sure
@lisitsyn	I am not aware of your agenda :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is he interested?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeh he is
@lisitsyn	project like update vw?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I actually think we'd rather integrate it with minimal changes
@lisitsyn	I mean now we have a bunch of new classes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah exactly
@HeikoS	integration
@HeikoS	of the latest vw features
@lisitsyn	like structural?
@lisitsyn	lda etc?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah dont know
@HeikoS	I dont know vw that well
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but the idea would be to expose features in both directions
@HeikoS	also that vw can use shoguns classifier for its reductions
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm really? is john interested in that?
@lisitsyn	that sounds unusual for vw-way but I can get it wrong
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	he said
@HeikoS	we will just talk
@HeikoS	wanna join?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok let me know when
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: if I can't make it could you please just let me know what you discussed?
@lisitsyn	I can help with that somehow I guess
@HeikoS	its thursday 2pm London time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool!
@HeikoS	ok I gotta go now
@lisitsyn	ok cool
@lisitsyn	I'll check if I can leave for a chat
@lisitsyn	see you
@HeikoS	Thursday 10am eastern time?
@lisitsyn	I am not getting that :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  just sent an email with you cced
@lisitsyn	ok I'll let you know
@lisitsyn	whether it works
