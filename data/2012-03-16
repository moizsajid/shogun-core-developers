 n4nd0	blackburn: hey!
 n4nd0	blackburn: why is it that some stuff implemented (e.g. the cover tree) doesn't appear in doxygen online?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm probably I haven't done any doc on that
 blackburn	better check code than doc
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	yeah
-!- GenX__ [~Sambhav@14.139.82.6] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	but I think it can be useful for people that want to use shogun
 n4nd0	I think that one of the first things people do is to use the search
-!- GenX [~Sambhav@14.139.82.6] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 blackburn	sure, I mean you're now a developer :)
 blackburn	so doc may be wrong and better check code
 n4nd0	I'm still curious because I don't really get it
 n4nd0	if the code is commented, what is the step left to do so it appears in the doc?
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 n4nd0	I mean that the code is already with doxygen style documentation, at least I think so
-!- in3xes__ [in3xes@49.248.244.31] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/lib/CoverTree.h
 blackburn	no, not doxygen
 blackburn	no @brief at least
 blackburn	should be here, feel free to add
 blackburn	n4nd0: it works in following way:
 blackburn	you need to implement some point structure that provides distances to different point
 n4nd0	blackburn: aha I say @return so I assumed it was with doxygen already
 blackburn	n4nd0: that was done in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/converter/LocallyLinearEmbedding.cpp
 blackburn	class LLE_COVERTREE_POINT
 blackburn	next you need to find neighbors using that covertree
 blackburn	that was done SGMatrix<int32_t> CLocallyLinearEmbedding::get_neighborhood_matrix(SGMatrix<float64_t> distance_matrix, int32_t k)
 blackburn	in *

 n4nd0	thanks for your help
 blackburn	no problem

 blackburn	sonney2k: thanks!
 blackburn	SOOOOOOOOOO?
 n4nd0	haha were are really expectants ...
 blackburn	your mail is too slow!
@sonney2k	blackburn, well I have a birthday present this time :)
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	say it
 n4nd0	:)
@sonney2k	WE ARE IN OMFG :D
 n4nd0	AWESOME
 blackburn	good present from google!
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have some vodka!
-!- puneet [~chatzilla@115.240.45.65] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, so considering #ideas on ideas list I put 9  into #desired slots?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure!
 blackburn	I hope they won't consider it as CRAZY number
 n4nd0	aha so first the organization is selected and later the number of slots requested ... I didn't know about that
 blackburn	sonney2k: we deserve 9 ;)
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can announce in the ML
 blackburn	now with less typos than before cause I am not any drunk with vodka this time
 n4nd0	:)
@sonney2k	blackburn, is this page public yet: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/shogun ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you mean? I can see it if it is what you ask
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	that is what I was asking (I was just writing / copying all this)
 n4nd0	and shogun is finally in the list http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2012
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so shall I announce?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, funny there is no real other machine learning project in there - all the others that have a machine learning tag are very specific projects (like data base/ speech recognition...)
@sonney2k	blackburn, feel free - I hope that the vodka activates you linguistic cortex :)
@sonney2k	so less mistakes :D
 blackburn	sure

 n4nd0	let me know if I can help with something guys
 quinn__	I ama student from India,how can I apply for GSOC 2012?
 quinn__	what is the scheme for the student application ?
 n4nd0	quinn__: hi! I don't think the template is ready yet
 n4nd0	quinn__: but you may want to start checking the ideas page http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html
 blackburn	n4nd0: exactly - that's how you can help haha
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn: :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not drunk enough :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think we need to add to the template that before even considering to apply one should check out latest git sources, get shogun to compile for the desired interface and submit a (small) patch via a github pull request.
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure
 blackburn	exactly
 blackburn	yes

@sonney2k	do you think things are ready?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how much time you have right now?
 blackburn	we are pretty near, but we would have to check things again

@sonney2k	well we should check of course
 blackburn	checked tests
@sonney2k	regardings NEWS file
 blackburn	ok no new regressions
@sonney2k	blackburn, when you write tests you mean examples, tests or old testsuite?
 blackburn	old
@sonney2k	blackburn is it ok if we mention EDRT not as version?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea..
-!- romi_ [~mizobe@187.74.11.203] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, let me write what I have in mind
 blackburn	sonney2k: why you want so?
 blackburn	I just added it to make it a little 'different' from shogun
@sonney2k	EDRT is part of shogun but I don't want to give it an extra 'sub' version
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't want to do it as well..
 blackburn	the only reason is my jmlr paper you know
-!- quinn__ [~quinn@59.95.208.2] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]

@sonney2k	make run-testsuite dies here ... AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'parameter_list'
 blackburn	hm
 blackburn	lemme check
 blackburn	oh shit
 blackburn	sonney2k: damn I renamed labels and max train time
 blackburn	and it impacted on serialization
 blackburn	:E
 blackburn	what should I do then?
 blackburn	ah probably restore its names?
@sonney2k	whenever you rename sth you need to rename anything use heikos' migrations!
@sonney2k	otherwise don't!
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok what you suggest?
 blackburn	labels -> m_labels
 blackburn	and tests are not useful anymore
@sonney2k	well try heikos migrations :)
@sonney2k	he posted an example on the mailinglist
