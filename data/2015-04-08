@lambday	lisitsyn: there?
 lisitsyn	lambday: hey
@lambday	lisitsyn: how are things? :D
 lisitsyn	lambday: fine
 lisitsyn	what about you?
 lisitsyn	currently mapreducing some stuff around :)
@lambday	lisitsyn: haha that's great!
@lambday	lisitsyn: I have been working on hypothesis testing a bit
@lambday	and lately (thanks to wu lin) doing some stuffs in linalg as well
 lisitsyn	hmm cool
 lisitsyn	I am on my way to refactor neural nets a bit
@lambday	lisitsyn: one thing I want your opinion on
 lisitsyn	sure
@lambday	lisitsyn: check this benchmark https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2806
@lambday	it comes from a discussion here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2801
 lisitsyn	oh something big
@lambday	so long story short -
@lambday	wu lin was using linalg methods without specifying any backend
@lambday	and he's using SGMatrix
 lisitsyn	okay I've seen there is a bug
 lisitsyn	some forgotten loading right?
@lambday	so if someone sets viennacl for global backend, then we're doing all the CPU-GPU data transfer
@lambday	which stabs the performance at the heart
 lisitsyn	yeah that's obvious
@lambday	lisitsyn: that is fixed - we just needed a variant that returned the result matrix/vector
@lambday	ok so what I was thinking is
@lambday	how about a cmake switch to make SGMatrix as GPU one shogun-wise?
@lambday	we can just inherit from a separate base
@lambday	based on some preprocessor flag
@lambday	that way, we can milk the performance boost to the fullest when GPU is used
@lambday	this is totally possible even now with explicitly using CGPUMatrix+ViennaCL backed
 lisitsyn	hmm let me think
@lambday	but how about we use the same SGMatrix everywhere - with the backend changed in a switch
@lambday	I am mainly worried because you see in the benchmark the penalty is unbearable
 lisitsyn	I see no crime in such switch for sure
 lisitsyn	but I have doubts we can hide gpu
@lambday	but when we use GPU memory then gain makes me drool :D
 lisitsyn	I mean you always have to care whether you transfer data or not
 lisitsyn	btw check torch
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/torch/torch7
@lambday	lisitsyn: checking..
 lisitsyn	neural guys love to use it
@lambday	lisitsyn: what I was saying is something like
@lambday	struct CPUMatrix
@lambday	{
@lambday	}
@lambday	;
@lambday	struct GPUMatrix {};
@lambday	#ifdef USE_CPU
 lisitsyn	oh you finally talk C++ now I understand ;)
@lambday	lol
@lambday	you got the idea
@lambday	so two bases
 lisitsyn	can we get more flexible with less compile time stuff?
@lambday	what do you see the problem with that?
 lisitsyn	I am a bit worried about switching everything
 lisitsyn	I mean if sgmatrix is in gpu
 lisitsyn	some stuff would break right?
@lambday	I'm thinking what would that be..
 lisitsyn	most of code is not written for gpu so we should expect bugs here
@lambday	well that makes sense..
@lambday	so devs should explicitly use gpumatrix if they wanna use one..
 lisitsyn	lambday: it seems to me that sgmatrix should be kind of dynamic about that
 lisitsyn	maybe there is some solution to make it a bit more dynamic
@lambday	lisitsyn: what do you mean by dynamic?
 lisitsyn	like sometimes it is gpu but sometimes it is cpu
@lambday	lisitsyn: that's what I meant..
@lambday	#ifdef USE_CPU
 lisitsyn	I mean not globally
@lambday	lisitsyn: okay.. so some param
 lisitsyn	well say in neural nets I have all these parameters in sgmatrix
 lisitsyn	that's cool to have it as gpu matrix
 lisitsyn	but some other algorithms do not expect gpu
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah that makes sense...
 lisitsyn	this doesn't fit your template linalg idea though
@lambday	lisitsyn: what I don't like is that now we have two different types of matrices
 lisitsyn	that's ok they are really different
 lisitsyn	it seems there is no magic to treat them in the same way
@lambday	yep.. apparently so :(
@lambday	in linalg we're anyway treating them differently
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	I think sgmatrix should be like tensor in torch
 lisitsyn	they have some clean api it seems
 lisitsyn	btw what about sgmatrix->sgtensor? ;)
@lambday	lol we do have that multidimensional array thing right?
@lambday	maybe make that more like tension
@lambday	oops
@lambday	tensor
@lambday	totally didn't mean tension :D
 lisitsyn	hah
 lisitsyn	that's actually super cool thing
 lisitsyn	that they can generalize
 lisitsyn	say you have RGB image
@lambday	I'm assuming that it is efficient as well
 lisitsyn	and then you got RGB-D and its 3d
 lisitsyn	nothing works
 lisitsyn	:D
@lambday	voxels ? :D
 lisitsyn	yeah like these
 lisitsyn	and when aliens get control of humanity
 lisitsyn	we get to 4d
 lisitsyn	would be bad to rewrite code again
@lambday	gotta check it then!
 lisitsyn	aha
 lisitsyn	ohh these MR tasks go so slow
@lambday	it's in C !
 lisitsyn	yeah lua + C
