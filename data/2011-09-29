 blackburn	sonne|work: around?
 sonne|work	yes?
 sonne|work	wassup?
 sonne|work	blackburn: ^
 blackburn	sonne|work: I've been thinking about integrating superLU-MT
 blackburn	but the problem is that debian have no superlu-mt package
 sonne|work	what is MT?
 blackburn	multithreaded
 sonne|work	k
 sonne|work	why not
 blackburn	sonne|work: so the question is how to integrate it
 blackburn	can we integrate the codebase?
 sonne|work	not integrate
 sonne|work	everyone that has it installed can use it
 sonne|work	otherwise not
 blackburn	hmm okay
 blackburn	sonne|work: another question
 blackburn	I need to separate my 'toolbox' somehow
 blackburn	are you against it in any means?
 sonne|work	separate what / how?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I guess I have to make it compile-able even without shogun
 sonne|work	that is a lot of work...
 blackburn	sonne|work: I don't need to separate it completely
 sonne|work	I am certainly not a big fan of this
 sonne|work	what you could do is require libshogun of some version and provide the extensions for that
 blackburn	ah yes!
 blackburn	why not to require libshogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'm not sure if I really need to do that, but it can't be yet another paper on shogun
 sonne|work	that is clear - but it is not a paper about shogun but about your dimred methods with which you extented shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: and the last question I've got today: would you mind me implement lapack/arpack wrappers not only for double but for float too?
 sonne|work	feel free
 blackburn	sonne|work: I guess we will try to treat it as shogun extending
 sonne|work	of course
 sonne|work	I mean we already came to that conclusion or?
 blackburn	sonne|work: hope that will work
 sonne|work	like the weka guys did with kepler
 sonne|work	etc
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah okay
 sonne|work	we had like 3-4 jmlr submissions that extended weka somehow
 sonne|work	or where tools that used weka internally
 blackburn	sonne|work: today I came up with yet another algorithm extension
 blackburn	kernel ltsa :)
 blackburn	kind of innovative hehe
 blackburn	sonne|work: can I implement some tests in say libshogun/lsdrt/?
 blackburn	not right in libshogun?
 blackburn	btw I think it could be good idea to develop some tests in subfolders
 blackburn	like /svm/ or so
 blackburn	sonne|work: you aren't feeling happy with our effort to get published :)
 sonne|work	why not examples/libshogun
 sonne|work	no no I am perfectly fine with it
 sonne|work	just not too much additional effort to separate from shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: I need as much as needed to get published :)
 sonne|work	reviewers will tell you
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	sonne|work: can you send me some references to papers describing multiclass svms?
 blackburn	when you have some time for that
 blackburn	I ve found http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~xfrancv/papers/Franc-MultiSVM-ICPR02.pdf is it worth to study?
 sonne|work	gtg
 sonne|work	cu
 blackburn	see you
