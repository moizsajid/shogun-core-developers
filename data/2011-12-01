 LoneRanger	Hi, I'm having problems with Shogun and Python, I'm new to Shogun so the fault could be entirely mine
 LoneRanger	but here is what I get:  https://gist.github.com/1418342
 LoneRanger	when I try to run the example code at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/shogun/PythonExamples
 LoneRanger	I just took the code there, added a shebang and ran it

 LoneRanger	details at github:gist
 sonne|work	LoneRanger:  better not use the outdated examples but the ones from the shogun-toolbox.org site
 sonne|work	and when you are new - please use python_modular interface instead of the obsolete static one
 sonne|work	it is much much better!
 LoneRanger	OK, thanks for the tip
 sonne|work	LoneRanger: examples are here http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/python_modular_examples.html
 sonne|work	or in shogun src code tarball
 LoneRanger	OK, thanks again, BTW, I'm interested in finding/making a Python Machine Learning toolkit and hope shogun will have a place in it
 LoneRanger	if it works out I'll open source it
 sonne|work	well we like shogun base applications any use of the toolkit :)
 LoneRanger	any issues in using shogun as a dependency?
 LoneRanger	if shogun is as good as it looks like it may be I may not need to do all that much :)
 sonne|work	issues?
 sonne|work	I am not sure what you mean
 sonne|work	you just import modshogun and use it
 LoneRanger	license or technical
 sonne|work	license is gplv3+, technical - its core is C++ - it works on linux/osx/cygwin
 LoneRanger	shogun is GPL3 isn't it?
 sonne|work	yes
 LoneRanger	oops, yes you just said that
 LoneRanger	Anyway, sorry to be a bother and thanks for your time :-D
 sonne|work	ok cu
