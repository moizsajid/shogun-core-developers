 n4nd0	blackburn: what's exactly?
 n4nd0	what's it*
 blackburn	n4nd0: trying to compute disparities in most efficient way
 n4nd0	blackburn: how are these disparities defined?
 n4nd0	difference between corresponding pixels in pair of images?
 blackburn	yes something like that
 blackburn	it corresponds to real distance
 blackburn	so one gets depth of image
 blackburn	I'm currently trying to make use of graph-cuts based reconstruction
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so what you are doing so far is to find out the depth using one camera and different frames taken in time?
 blackburn	no, two cameras
 n4nd0	aham, then stereovision
 blackburn	yes exactly
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	is to find the depth the final objective?
 blackburn	no, final is to recognize humans
 blackburn	in a room
 n4nd0	aham, ok I see
 n4nd0	it is kind of what kinect does by default then
 blackburn	heh no, I need to count how much human-like creatures there are in room
 blackburn	how many I mean :D
 n4nd0	ahm ok
 n4nd0	I think you can do that using one of kinect's APIs directly though...
 n4nd0	is it this you are going to use CRFs for?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah I wanted to try that too
 blackburn	there are a lot of methods
 blackburn	no idea what is the best
 n4nd0	blackburn: find it and do something better than kinect! :)
 blackburn	hah, it is a little different task still
 n4nd0	why so?
 blackburn	kinect is for recognize actions, I just want to recognize how many 2m x 0.6m x 0.3m bounding boxes in the room
 blackburn	and later may be I would need to count human creatures in bigger rooms or even on streets
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	I think the first thing that kinect does is that, look for humans around the room
 n4nd0	but it is true that it does not work in outer spaces, I think
 blackburn	to be honest I have no idea how kinect works
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	maybe it can turn out to be inspiring, who knows
 blackburn	opencv has some methods for disparities
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	nice
 blackburn	yesterday I learned some blender and I confess I like it even more than doing stupid science :D
 n4nd0	:D

 gsomix	sonney2k, around?

@sonney2k	gsomix, wassup?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you sure you have a better example? seems like 1imeouts kicked in http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/91/steps/test/logs/stdio
 blackburn	sonney2k: well no idea why it hanged
 blackburn	but may be I should cahnge data everywhere
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah we should not use data generated on-the-fly but just from /data
 gsomix	sonney2k, how are you? are there some ideas and plan for further work?
* gsomix away

 blackburn	n4nd0: do you know thomas larsson?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no
 blackburn	n4nd0: he is from KTH and develops makehuman
 n4nd0	let me check what makehuman is
 blackburn	software to generate humans
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	computational graphics stuff right?
 blackburn	kind of - I need it to place some generated guys around in 3d room
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	I want to experiment with real depth map as well
 n4nd0	you are already testing?
 blackburn	and I have no lidar
 blackburn	well I learned blender a little, now trying various rooms
 blackburn	with opencv
 n4nd0	I thought you were going to get the depth from images not using depth sensors
-!- gsomix_ [~gsomix@80.234.20.168] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	but I need true depth to evaluate methods
 blackburn	and I have no lidar or anything to do that for real
 blackburn	ahahah nice software
 blackburn	sex is A SLIDER there
 blackburn	more tits to the left and less to the right *rofl*
 blackburn	oh man
 blackburn	genitalia is a slider too
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	oh damn
 blackburn	n4nd0: you must try it
 blackburn	:D

 gsomix_	blackburn, sexy man :]
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need sth like this
@sonney2k	http://www.makehuman.org/nightlybuild
 blackburn	yeah may be
 gsomix_	sonney2k, hey!
@sonney2k	gsomix_, hey!
 gsomix_	>> sonney2k, how are you? are there some ideas and plan for further work?
@sonney2k	gsomix_, well the typemaps for model selection ...
 gsomix_	ok
@sonney2k	gsomix_, heiko should be back next week too so if you can get a grasp on the typemaps he will likely have time to help with the object creation stuff
 gsomix_	sonney2k, this is good news
 blackburn	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/man.png I did something wrong
