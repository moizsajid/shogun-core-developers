 n4nd0	blackburn: that's a cool thing!
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah
 blackburn	http://song-of-github.herokuapp.com/?username=lisitsyn I sound funny too
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, I listened to you too :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: tapkee sounds intensive :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: I had a period with commit streak for 27 days
 n4nd0	blackburn: one can introduce projects too?
 blackburn	that was tapkee development
 blackburn	no I mean tapkee on my timeline
 n4nd0	or within your song?
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	lets listen to yours
 blackburn	pretty sparse! :)
 n4nd0	hehe yeah :(
 n4nd0	it starts well but...
 blackburn	make that song happier n4nd0
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	let's see :)
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	today a do a yeah on github
 n4nd0	year
 n4nd0	year of contributions Feb 22 2012 - Fec 22 2013
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't think so :) it just shows an year
 n4nd0	lol I am stupid
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://github.com/lisitsyn same for me
 sonne|work	n4nd0: have you seen? I put your changes live. now please fix the website :)
 sonne|work	I think we should add the gsoc ideas / stuff back from 20{10,11,12}
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hey! yeah I saw it yesterday at night
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think it is fixed, or do you see something wrong?
 sonne|work	looks a bit weird when we have no sub menus but still the menu line is empty
 sonne|work	I mean in: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/information
 sonne|work	the black line is empty
 n4nd0	yeah I see what you mean
 n4nd0	sonne|work: how would you like to see that?
 sonne|work	to have them in the black line usually only when a sub-menu is available not?
 sonne|work	no idea if that's easy to do. maybe it is easier to add another menu line below then?
 n4nd0	let me think of it a moment
 sonne|work	n4nd0: the other thing that is confusing me is that I wanted to have http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013
 sonne|work	to be a news subpage
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think the second one is easier
 sonne|work	so it should display
 sonne|work	Updates | Program | Registration
 sonne|work	but no idea how to do that
 sonne|work	(or if it is even possible)
 n4nd0	it is similar to how it is done now
 n4nd0	but the updates page is the main Workshop 2013
 sonne|work	n4nd0: a third idea - how about when you mouse hover over 'Workshop 2013' that it would then display a .js menu with Updates, Program Registration?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: regarding the thing of the menu line below the current one
 sonne|work	and then display that in the You are here: Events  /  workshop2013 / Updates
 sonne|work	etc?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: even if a new one is added, in the pages that do not have subpage, the menu line below would be empty
 sonne|work	then we don't need any new lines
 n4nd0	sonne|work: so you mean that the sub-pages do not stay permanently but only popped up when the mouse is over the current parent
 n4nd0	say in the current events page
 n4nd0	when in workshop 2013, program and registration are not shown
 n4nd0	they are shown when mouse over workshop 2013
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	and only in the you are here line this extra stuff is added
 n4nd0	sonne|work: that can be done
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@dslb-092-078-043-220.pools.arcor-ip.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	so the mouse over would do the you are here line disappear?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no
 sonne|work	n4nd0: the mouse over would just display a menu
 sonne|work	with e.g. Updates | Registration ...
 sonne|work	and then when you click on updates
 sonne|work	the you are here line would display ...workshop -> updates
 sonne|work	so one more level
 n4nd0	and after clicking in, say Updates, the displayed menu Updates | Registration ... does not need to remain shown?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ^
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, I am not 100% but I think I should be able to do that with the little I've learnt about this stuff
 sonne|work	n4nd0: one could think of displaying the hierarchy in the your are here line though, via You are here: Events  /  workshop2013 / (*updates* | registration | foo )
 sonne|work	where *updates* is highlighted
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I see an issue
 sonne|work	yes?
 n4nd0	there would be a gap between the menu line showing e.g. Workshop, GSoC
 n4nd0	and the the line You are here ...
 n4nd0	so when the mouse is over Workshop or GSoC
 n4nd0	the submenu can be shon
 n4nd0	shown*
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I don't understand
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I meant some menu like this: http://demos.9lessons.info/DropMenu/MyDemo.html
 n4nd0	sonne|work: draw for me in a paper what you want to have and send me a picture of it, it will take less time :D
 sonne|work	so why shoudl there be a gap?
 n4nd0	I didn't think of it like that
 n4nd0	I didn't understand you meant a drop down menu
 n4nd0	but a menu like the one we have now with the entries appearing along the same line
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I can try to take a look to how to do this
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yeah I meant a drop down menu
 n4nd0	but no idea how long can this take me
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what I have done now is probably rather simple and has taken me more than two days doing just that
 sonne|work	well just take the menu code from http://www.9lessons.info/2012/06/simple-drop-down-menu-with-jquery-and.html
 sonne|work	I think it is rather easy to do then
 sonne|work	you only have to fill in the fields?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I have no idea about javascript
 n4nd0	I have to see how it works together with django templates
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no difference :)
 n4nd0	there will probably be some issues like
 n4nd0	when the menu drops down
 n4nd0	does it cover the information under it?
 n4nd0	such as the "You are here..." line
 n4nd0	I will investigate a bit
 n4nd0	sonne|work: btw, no issues in shogun-web yet?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no the menu is just displayed on top everything. once you click you have to change the you are here line no earlier
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no issues AFAIK but I am not sure what you are looking for
 n4nd0	sonne|work: roger that :)
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 n4nd0	here there is a tab for issues
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web
 n4nd0	and here, there is not
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I wanted to write a couple of things that I think will be nice to remember - few fixes that the website needs
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ok have a look at  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web again :D
 n4nd0	sonne|work: that is what I meant, ty!
 sonne|work	n4nd0: do you want me to create an issue and assign it to you :D
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha no need for it
 n4nd0	that would put me more pressure to get it done fast :)
 n4nd0	oops maybe it was not a good idea to say that...
 sonne|work	n4nd0: if you do that by the end of today it is totally ok ;-)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: lol I cannot do that, I have to take care of my degree project
 n4nd0	it has been quite abandoned these days
 n4nd0	sonne|work: btw, does the shogun logo on the top right corner appear overlapped with the FAQ page in your browser?
 n4nd0	it does in mine
 n4nd0	i remember blackburn said it looked ok in his
-!- heiko [~heiko@nat-182-132.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no it looks ok here - which browser?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: chromium
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it seems that it depends whether I zoom the page or not
 n4nd0	but when default view is use - no zoom - it is overlapped
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I am zooming in and out and no issues..
 sonne|work	chrome here
 n4nd0	chromium users are on their own then :D
 heiko	sonne|work, your patch refactor parameters to use SGVector as dims (for future ndarray support)        broke the streaming dense features, any reasons why you removed the lines in StreamingDenseFeatures.cpp ?
 heiko	on another note, debug messages dont work anymore on my classes, I have no idea why this is
 blackburn	heiko: does info wrok?
 heiko	blackburn, no idea
 heiko	print does
 blackburn	heiko: actually sonney2k added there branch prediction but I believe it should not disable anything
 heiko	blackburn, see for example LinearTimeMMD.cpp line 130
 heiko	this is not outputted
 heiko	but if i add a SG_PRINT in the next line, I can see this
 heiko	and blackburn, do we care if unit-tests leak memory?
 blackburn	heiko: yeah I think so
 n4nd0	heiko: stupid question, are you setting log_level with an SGObject?
 blackburn	hah I guess so n4nd0
 n4nd0	just to be sure :)
 heiko	n4nd0, I am doing
 n4nd0	heiko: all right, sorry
 heiko	sg_io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG);
 heiko	in my main
 heiko	but doing it on the instance also doesnt help
 heiko	strange thing is I CAN see other debug messages
 heiko	just not all of them
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	heiko: ah so you just can't see that one??
 heiko	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	ehm
 heiko	code is executed however
 heiko	since turning it into a print makes it appear
 blackburn	quite interesting
 heiko	indeed :D
 heiko	not too important, I just noticed
 blackburn	heiko: well what I could suggest is to remove branch predicting hint in SGIO
 blackburn	and check
 blackburn	I have no other idea and this shouldn't actually be the reason
 heiko	blackburn, on another note: the unit-tests with valgrind is a quite sad thing
 blackburn	heiko: you are just like russian tv
 heiko	Is there actually a way of running single tests without having to create new files for this?
 blackburn	no good news
 heiko	blackburn why? :)
 heiko	ah
 heiko	I am sorry
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	jk
 heiko	well I fixed many bugs today and yesterday :)
 blackburn	heiko: what do you mean?
 heiko	thats good noews
 heiko	blackburn, say I want to execute one test in one file
 heiko	for fixing
 heiko	how do I do this best?
 blackburn	w/o make ?
 heiko	since running them all is annoying if I only want to fix one
 blackburn	frankly I wanted that too but was lazy to check
 blackburn	it is a good chance
 heiko	I think it would be also good to have the valgrind statistics for the single files, not for all tests
 heiko	since not easy to get an overview
 blackburn	heiko: we should patch makefile for that I guess
 blackburn	now we just compile it into one executable
 heiko	agreed :)
 heiko	I am not sure whether one of my tests leaks but I dont want to go through them one by one :)

 heiko	lol github is offline
 blackburn	cool
 heiko	cannot commit
 heiko	ehm push
 heiko	and the buildbot cannot do anything
 blackburn	heiko: yeah web doesn't work as well
 heiko	well
 heiko	this means:
 heiko	time to go home :)
 heiko	so byebys blackbird ;)
 heiko	ehm blackburn
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	heiko: doesn't your irc client supports auto nick completion?
 heiko	what is that?
 heiko	blackburn:
 heiko	oh
 blackburn	well in pidgin I usually write he[Tab]
 heiko	yes :)
 heiko	it does
 heiko	blackburn: hello
 blackburn	son[Tab]
 heiko	nice
 blackburn	wi[Tab]
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	wow that saves time with all those strange nicknames :)
 heiko	blackburn: thanks for the tip
 heiko	i used to type everything
 blackburn	heiko: well at least you train in typing :D
 heiko	yeah :)
 heiko	blackburn: I am quite fast these days
 heiko	blackburn: the makefile change in the unit-tests would be great to have if you have some time
 blackburn	heiko: yeah I will have some time this weekend
 heiko	blackburn: nice :)
 blackburn	heiko: I am now having a luv time with openmp - trying to parallelize some things in tapkee
 heiko	I am also close
 heiko	yeah this is a good idea
 heiko	is openmp for multicore or also such that different processes can be started?
 heiko	for cluster etc
 heiko	since the kernel mmd stuff can also be parallelised
 heiko	but makes more sense to do this massively
 blackburn	well mainly multicore - there exists some crazy openmp for clusters but no idea how it works
 heiko	ok
 heiko	I am not too keen on multicore parallelisations, a lot of work for not so much speedup
 heiko	unless there will be 20xcore cpus
 heiko	but on a cluster
 heiko	this would be cool
 blackburn	with openmp it should be easy but I don't get something :D
 blackburn	I slowed down implementation - trying to understand why
 heiko	hehe dont you have a multicore machine?
 blackburn	I think I have
 blackburn	there are 4 I believe
 heiko	yeah same here
 heiko	I have cluster access here at work, did some things on 250 processes at once
 heiko	this is really fast :)
 heiko	so if there is an automagic way to have this in shogun, this would be awesome
 heiko	but difficult to program
 blackburn	heiko: nothing automagic is possible with that I think
 heiko	maybe I will also stick with openmp
 blackburn	heiko: I am constantly thinking about 'workers'
 heiko	I will soon start working with graphlab, there these things are meant to be automagic
 blackburn	then we could build something really scalable
 heiko	blackburn: explain
 blackburn	heiko: if we define some 'workers', that know what to do
 blackburn	they could be run both multicore and multimachine
 heiko	but how does information exchange work?
 blackburn	heiko: with messages
 heiko	ok
 heiko	and these are either implemented in in shared memory or via network etc
 blackburn	heiko: yeah there are some solutions for that
 blackburn	zeromq, etc
 heiko	pretty cool
 heiko	however, unrealistic to implement in shogun, we would have to change everything :D
 blackburn	heiko: yeah..
 heiko	maybe for new stuff
 heiko	btw thats what the graphlab guys are intending
 heiko	I will spy them out a bit and then tell you what its like :)
 blackburn	heiko: yeah that's an old idea actually
 shogun-buildbot_	build #821 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/821  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 blackburn	heiko: main reason I think about that is that my job is related to multiagent systems and I get damaged by that
 heiko	blackburn, btw we could also launch multiple processes for the tests and examples
 heiko	since sloooow
 heiko	I see :)
 heiko	blackburn, I would be keen on those things
 blackburn	heiko: I know some great library for message passing (but in java)
 blackburn	akka that is
 blackburn	I am very satisfied to use it
 blackburn	heiko: but to be honest I feel totally absolutely wrong doing one-core in 2013
 blackburn	heiko: it is just like using calculators to solve differential equations

 wiking	blackburn: mpi?
 wiking	that's pretty much straightforward
 blackburn	wiking: come on that's like fortran for parallel stuff
 wiking	well still
 blackburn	in a bad sense
 wiking	it's pretty stable
 wiking	and works very well on clusters
 wiking	then again of course not on desktop machines with n cores
 wiking	it's intended for clusters i admit :P
 wiking	but mpi is used widely for a reason when u are dealing with c++ and multinodes
 blackburn	yeah I know
 wiking	but then go with M/R setup
 wiking	i.e. like mahout
 blackburn	yeah everything is done actually I understand :)
 wiking	heheh well mahout could take some total refurbishment :P
 wiking	but hadoop has c++ interface
 wiking	it's pretty shit i must admit :)
 wiking	the people at yahoo should be killed for that one ;)
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	apparently they are pretty much the only left big users of that interface
 wiking	but it's horrible
 wiking	totally out of sync with the core API
 wiking	so it pretty much calls functions there are deprecated for like 2 years now
 wiking	and stuff like this
 wiking	afaik we are better of with that line of opencl
 wiking	that's not done yet
 wiking	;)
 wiking	there's graphlab and mahout for distributed machine learning
 wiking	but both of them pretty much are going along with multiple nodes with n core cpus
 wiking	gpu based stuff is not much in use
 wiking	Theano is pretty much one ML lib that uses cuda
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	so that viennaCL stuff last year was a good start in that sense imo
 wiking	but i think we had this conversation like 2 months ago or so
 wiking	:))))
 blackburn	wiking: I still think something is wrong with GPU computing
 wiking	well you wouldn't think that when u would have a nvidia tesla in your machine ;P
 wiking	of course the memory maintainance is pretty shit
 wiking	moving constantly between the actual ram and the gpu memory
 wiking	can be a pain in the ass
 blackburn	well yeah may be I wouldn't think so but something is wrong
 wiking	my concern is always this
 wiking	the bottleneck of moving the memory content back and forth
 wiking	i mean sometimes it's not even worth to move things into the xmm registers
 wiking	so then think about moving it to a different memory...
 blackburn	wiking: any idea why for loop with openmp gets slower than serial? :D
 blackburn	can't make any sense of it :(
 blackburn	no sync at all
 wiking	well threading
 blackburn	wiking: hmm changing compiler helped
 blackburn	wiking: I admit gcc terribly sucks in everything
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	:D
