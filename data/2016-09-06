 yorkerlin	ping wiking
@wiking	pong what's up
 yorkerlin	about the optimization framework
@wiking	yep
 yorkerlin	r you working on kkt solvers?
@wiking	heheh wish
@wiking	till now it was pushing bits areound
@wiking	for gsoc
@wiking	and some javascript related stuff with shogun + windows port of shogun
@wiking	so not yet
 yorkerlin	ic. so we can discuss about the framework
@wiking	definitely
@wiking	so the thing is
@wiking	that since now we have a full refact
@wiking	of the linalg backend
@wiking	we should rely on that
@wiking	heavily
@wiking	so for any matrix factorization
@wiking	or basically any linalg operations we should use the new linalg backend
@wiking	in the beginning it's going to be a pain a bit
@wiking	because it'll require us to implement some of the linalg methods of our own
@wiking	but it's worth it in the long run
@wiking	because then one will be able to choose between the backend being used for linalg calculations (like cpu, gpu etc.)
 yorkerlin	do we assume that we can use the linalg lib in the opt framework
@wiking	yes
@wiking	definitely
@wiking	as well as openmp
@wiking	and c++11
 yorkerlin	maybe we should list most of operators used in the opt framework
@wiking	for kkt there are usually LDL, QR factorization
@wiking	so basically matrix factorization
 yorkerlin	I may need LDLT
 yorkerlin	Heiko told me that now tensorflow supports API for building computational graphs in C++
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	we could rely on that
 yorkerlin	so we should have some backends for gradient computation (eg, tensorflow and hand gradient )
@wiking	yep
@wiking	so in my mind
@wiking	if some of the heavy computation stuff we cannot only cover with linalg lib
@wiking	we should wrap it somehow
@wiking	so we could later easily factor it out
@wiking	and have a different implementation of it
@wiking	since now most of the case is the problem is that all the computation is hard-coded
@wiking	hence it's very hard to factor it out
@wiking	ok not very hard
@wiking	but cumbersome
@wiking	and nowadays if i look at libsvm, svmlight implementation
@wiking	my heart starts to bleed :)
 yorkerlin	so add a tensorflow backend in the linalg lib?
@wiking	mmm i'm not so sure if we wanna add it there
@wiking	but i'll check how we can integrate it
@wiking	my only question is
@wiking	for example
@wiking	in case of TF
@wiking	would it be possible to distribute the computations?
@wiking	i mean it says "data flow graphs for scalable machine learning"
@wiking	but to be honest if one asks me i much more prefer an actor based framework for distributing the computations between nodes
 yorkerlin	multiple GPUs?
@wiking	gpus, cpus whatever :)
 yorkerlin	the focus of Shogun is single machine, right?
@wiking	mmm should not be :)
@wiking	i mean yes currently we only support that
@wiking	but would be good to start not only support that
@wiking	hence why i'm telling here that all the computations
@wiking	should be wrapped
@wiking	into some abstraction
@wiking	so that later having different way of doing the computations
@wiking	would be easy to change
 yorkerlin	do we pay attention to PC clusters instead of HPC?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	but we should not focus now on
@wiking	how the clustering is being done
@wiking	just make it possible
@wiking	from the code point of view
 yorkerlin	ic
 yorkerlin	we should do a lot of refactoring.
@wiking	yep :)
 yorkerlin	I will be back in 10 mins.
@wiking	k
@wiking	the best is to do what we did with the linalg refactor gsoc project
 yorkerlin	does the linalg refactor project listed in the wiki?
 yorkerlin	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_project_linalg ?
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Google%20Summer%20of%20Code%202016%20Projects
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_clean_up_infrastructure
@wiking	it was this one
@wiking	oxphos wrote a whole wiki page
@wiking	about the project
@wiking	you can find it here... lemme try to find t
@wiking	it
 yorkerlin	we should  investigate how to integrate tensoflow in the meantime
@wiking	yorkerlin,
@wiking	https://github.com/OXPHOS/shogun/wiki/GSoC-2016-Final-Report-:-The-Shogun-Detox
@wiking	this is the report of that project
 yorkerlin	I will take a look at the report
 yorkerlin	we may need a tensorflow backend if gradient information is needed.
 yorkerlin	BTW, do you know this project, https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow
 yorkerlin	GPflow uses the python API from tensorflow. BTW, matrix solvers are needed in GP.
 yorkerlin	I mean that tensowflow should support many matrix solvers
 yorkerlin	at least in the python API
 yorkerlin	Once the C++ API is polished, we could use the C++ API to build a tensorflow backend.
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	but what's tensorflow giving
@wiking	in extra here?
 yorkerlin	maybe we should have a gradient computation framework?
 yorkerlin	for hand gradient, the linalg is used. for AD, tensorflow is used
@wiking	AD?
 yorkerlin	automatic differentiation
@wiking	ah
@wiking	ok i need to dig in
@wiking	how we could use tf's computation graph
@wiking	via the c++ api
@wiking	because that support just recently has been released
@wiking	till now it was only via python api
 yorkerlin	no. accodring to the release note
 yorkerlin	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases
 yorkerlin	Added graph-construction C API Major revision to the graph-construction C++ API
 yorkerlin	I am looking for examples about how to use the C++/C API
@wiking	no?
@wiking	i mean it has been released
@wiking	recently
@wiking	or/
@wiking	Added graph-construction C API
@wiking	this wasnt part till now
 yorkerlin	I mean tensorflow now has C++/C API for graph construction
@wiking	yep
@wiking	that's what i mean that till now it wasn't there
@wiking	so i have 0 idea
@wiking	how the api is like
 yorkerlin	yes. it is true. that is why I am looking for examples about the usage of the API
 yorkerlin	There are two ways to add a tensorflow backend.
 yorkerlin	one way is that each algorithm has at least two implemenations. one for hand gradient, the other for tensorflow.
 yorkerlin	There are two ways to use tensorflow in shogun. one way is that each algorithm has at least two implemenations. one for hand gradient, the other for tensorflow. another way is to add a tensorflow backend in the linalg lib.
 yorkerlin	do you think which way is better? or other suggestion?
 yorkerlin	or an AD framework (eg, tensorflow backend, CNTK backend, and Stan backend)
 yorkerlin	Let me say it again.
 yorkerlin	1 a tensorflow backend for the linalg; 2 an implementation for algorithms in shogun using tensorflow; 3 an AD framework which can use tensorflow, or CNTK, or STAN?
 yorkerlin	I have to leave now. I will be in ICR again soon.

 jones_	Hi, is there anybody here who could help me with loading a trained CMulticlassLibSVM after saving it to a file? Saving seems to work fine, but I'm not sure how you are supposed to load it. I couldn't find an example on the web or in the docu. Here is my current approach http://pastebin.com/YHbyEKJk
@wiking	and i guess model is an std::string that contains the path for the model file?
 jones_	Oh sry, yes its just a path
@wiking	ok and what's the error?
 jones_	I get the following error: [ERROR] In file .../shogun/src/shogun/kernel/Kernel.h line 211: LinearKernel::kernel(): index out of Range: idx_a=240/240 idx_b=0/240
@wiking	you get this while loading?
 jones_	No its occuring in apply_multiclass

@wiking	ah
 jones_	But I'm not sure if I'm setting the kernel and responses correctly, how are you supposed to set those while predicting?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	but what are you actually applying?
@wiking	the kernel that was in the trained machine?
@wiking	shogunsvm->load(f);
@wiking	will overwrite your CMulticlassLibSVM
@wiking	so you should set the kernel
 jones_	I initialize the kernel before with the test data: kernel->init(testfeatures,testfeatures);
@wiking	yeah but you set the kernel of the CMulticlassLibSVM
@wiking	before
@wiking	the loading of the pretrained data
@wiking	*model
 jones_	    shogunsvm->load(f);          kernel->init(testfeatures,testfeatures);         shogunsvm->set_kernel(kernel);         CMulticlassLabels*  labels=shogunsvm->apply_multiclass();
 jones_	has the same effect, hm
 jones_	maybe the saved model isn't even right, the support vector indices are kinda high
@wiking	dunno when and how you have created the svm
 jones_	I did an apply_multiclass with the trained svm and I get repsonses, so it should work
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	you could btw do a shogunsvm->apply_multiclass(testfeatures)
@wiking	right?
 jones_	yes, I also tried a single apply_one(0). Same error
@wiking	apply_one(0) ?
@wiking	it will give you the same error
@wiking	if you give a null input
 jones_	how am I supposed to input the test data? kernel->init?
@wiking	no
@wiking	just have the testfeatures
 jones_	so shogunsvm->apply_multiclass(testfeatures); ?
@wiking	virtual CMulticlassLabels* apply_multiclass(CFeatures* data=NULL);
@wiking	and yes
 jones_	and how do I set the kernel then?
 jones_	If I don't initialize the kernel I will get errors about its left and right hand sizes
 jones_	*sides
 jones_	[ERROR] In file .../shogun/src/shogun/multiclass/MulticlassSVM.cpp line 86: MulticlassLibSVM: No left hand side specified
@wiking	kernel should have been serialized
@wiking	already
@wiking	as part of the model
 jones_	I get: "shogun/src/shogun/multiclass/MulticlassSVM.cpp line 82: No kernel assigned! " if i don't set an explicit  kernel and as far I can follow it, CMulticlassSVM::load doesn't seem to set the kernel

@wiking	mmm that's actually a problem :(
@wiking	jones_: only good news i have now for you
@wiking	that soon we'll gonna have a new release :)
@wiking	and that has new serialization backend :)
 jones_	hooray, thanks for your help
@wiking	well
@wiking	not much i could helped it seems
 jones_	you answered my questions, its help enough ;) and you could report the bug. anyway I must leave now, thanks again and bye
@wiking	jones_: could you fill a bug
@wiking	in issues plz
@wiking	would be really appreciated
@wiking	and you would have an update
@wiking	as soon as it's fixed
 jones_	I will look into it
 jones_	cya
@wiking	thnmx
