@sonney2k	blackburn, what do we need before we can release?
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh I'm pretty unsure about it
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can't recall anything we should
@sonney2k	I mean cygwin, osx work quite ok now
@sonney2k	I mean we could finish this .h -> .cpp transition
@sonney2k	but that is still quite some work
 blackburn	is it so necessary?
 blackburn	err that necessary
@sonney2k	well it leads to much more readable header files and reduced compile times (only libshogun will be recompiled if the .cpp file is the only one that is changed)
@sonney2k	besides that I don't know what else we wanted for 1.1.0
 blackburn	sonney2k: too bad we can't do 1.1.0rc1 :)
 blackburn	well we can but it is the same as 1.1.0
 blackburn	cause we have 3.5 users totally
@sonney2k	3.5 ?
 blackburn	joke
 blackburn	not that much I mean
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you handle more bug reports / questions?
 blackburn	sonney2k: if they was about dimension reduction :D
 blackburn	were*
@sonney2k	...the website was down recently for just a few hrs and a couple of people already complained...
@sonney2k	so yes we have quite some users
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	we need shogun users census
@sonney2k	that's just some tiny fraction of shogun
 blackburn	to make me believe we have users :)
@sonney2k	we have enough traffic on the mailinglist...
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh for the release we need to run tests again
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would like to release on next weekend
@sonney2k	why weekend?
 blackburn	sonney2k: cause I'm fully available only on weekends )
@sonney2k	your b'day?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	and I am usually dead on weekends
 blackburn	no, my b'day is in march
 blackburn	that's a trouble
 blackburn	so what do you suggest?
@sonney2k	I would prefer to release ASAP
@sonney2k	i.e. we know that regression tests still work
 blackburn	well what about friday?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	today
 blackburn	oh today
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	or whenever we make it
 blackburn	why not
@sonney2k	could you update NEWS please?
@sonney2k	I don't know if today is possible - we will see what the tests say
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you run tests?
@sonney2k	doing already
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	will update news in a min
@sonney2k	ok crashes ahead
 blackburn	sonney2k: what crashes?
@sonney2k	hmmhh maybe clang related... recompiling
@sonney2k	blackburn, you have to generate test stuff

@sonney2k	converter_linearlocaltangentspacealig
 blackburn	uff I don't really have much time for that right now :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: any magic here?
@sonney2k	no just run the generator.py with these files
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw I would like to not do that, it could vary very much but it is ok
@sonney2k	vary very much? how so
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: +-1 e.g.
 blackburn	we don't handle it as I remember
@sonney2k	why / how?
 blackburn	sonney2k: eigenmethods
@sonney2k	I still dont' understand
 blackburn	both v and -v are eigenvectors
@sonney2k	and?
@sonney2k	isnt' what we do deterministic?
 blackburn	no, it is not very deterministic
 blackburn	I use at least two eigensolvers
 blackburn	lapack one and arpack
 blackburn	so results may vary
 blackburn	it is perfectly ok for dimension reduction but tests will fail
@sonney2k	but for lapack + arpack it is deterministic
 blackburn	e.g. if we have constructed feature matrix [1.0, 2.0; 4.0, 5.0]
 blackburn	it is ok to get [-1.0, -2.0; 4.0, 5.0]
 blackburn	and so on
 shogun-buildbot	build #46 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/46
@sonney2k	yeah but if you call it with arpack & lapack it will always be -1.0, -2.0, ...
 blackburn	no, lapack can use random initial eigenvector
 blackburn	are you suggesting to do three tests: with lapack, with arpack and with arpack+superlu?
 blackburn	I would like to implement unit-tests working in different way
 blackburn	they could test result not by |A-B| but by target function or so
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you remember any fixes I should mention?
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you seed lapack?
@sonney2k	git log
 blackburn	no, I don't think so
@sonney2k	hmmhh
@sonney2k	bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm sure that typical ||A-B|| tests won't work here
 blackburn	they all are not that stable
 blackburn	ill-posed everywhere
@sonney2k	is there anything deterministic in your algos ?
@sonney2k	I mean we can check for in the test?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, e.g. check distance matrices for MDS
 blackburn	or check barycentric coordinates in LLE
 blackburn	etc
 shogun-buildbot	build #329 of octave_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/329
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no idea how to generalize it
 blackburn	but know how to test
@sonney2k	then do that in the example and return a 'stable' result
 blackburn	sonney2k: return error function you mean?
 shogun-buildbot	build #330 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_static/builds/330  blamelist: sonne@debian.org, blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	yes that would work smoothly
 shogun-buildbot	build #346 of cmdline_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/346  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	sonney2k: but not now
 shogun-buildbot	build #330 of octave_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/330  blamelist: sonne@debian.org, blackburn91@gmail.com
 shogun-buildbot	build #322 of python_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/322  blamelist: sonne@debian.org, blackburn91@gmail.com
 CIA-37	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r54fc133 / src/NEWS : Update NEWS - http://git.io/jtDo7A
@sonney2k	looks like things crash due to the custom kernel change...
 blackburn	sonney2k: whoaa are you sure?
