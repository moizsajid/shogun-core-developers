 n4nd0	pluskid: hey! did you find the version of the paper you talked about yesterday?
 n4nd0	pluskid: I am in the university now so I can try to look for it otherwise
 pluskid	n4nd0: no, please try
 pluskid	I don't have easy access to the school network after graduation... :(
 n4nd0	pluskid: all right, got it :)
 n4nd0	pluskid: do you want me to mail it to you, dropbox, or?
 pluskid	n4nd0: mail me, thanks!
 pluskid	:D
 n4nd0	all right, it should be in your mailbox soon
 n4nd0	pluskid: let me know if it is the correct one
 pluskid	cool!
 pluskid	n4nd0: awesome! It's the one I'm looking for
 n4nd0	pluskid: nice, and I forgot to say, you are welcome ;)

 imeanwow	lol
 imeanwow	I accidently typed #shogun when I tried to name myself Shogun
 imeanwow	and that mistake brought me here.
 pluskid	welcome
-!- pluskid is now known as Shogun
 imeanwow	lol
 blackburn	n4nd0: Shogun: what is the paper?
 n4nd0	blackburn: sensitive ECOC
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://www.springerlink.com/content/n30xeen83d81ylbu/?MUD=MP
 blackburn	some data-dependant ecoc scheme?
 blackburn	hmm can you mail to me too? :)
 n4nd0	sure

 blackburn	n4nd0: when do you think you will be able to merge structured labels thing?
 n4nd0	blackburn: now it is in compilable state but there are things that probably need to be completed
 n4nd0	blackburn: what state do you want it to be in order to be merged?
 blackburn	hmm no idea - what is uncompleted in SO labels?
 n4nd0	I just have a basic interface now
 n4nd0	once I start using it for specific examples, functionality needs will pop up
 n4nd0	blackburn: for me, the sooner we merge it, the better. It feels safer
 blackburn	yes - but can't you provide all the needed functionality in that interface?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it could be a good idea to wait since I may not have a perfect idea of all we need there a priori
 blackburn	that's why you have mentor :)
 blackburn	however yes hard to predict everything
 n4nd0	what has it happened in github? the comments in the interface files seem to be wrong indented
 blackburn	where?
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/classifier/LDA.h
 n4nd0	I have opened some of them at random and they look so
 pluskid	looks fine here
 n4nd0	pluskid: mmm really? it appears in the browser, it should be the same for all I guess
 pluskid	all comments are of the same indent in my browser
 imeanwow	What is right or what is wrong? When you realize that you possess a highly powerful set of skills

 sonne|work	n4nd0: my take on this is that I would rather merge early and often as long as your code compiles and doesn't break anything
 sonne|work	and as you have seen - nothing in shogun is set in stone...
 sonne|work	but some things are harder to correct than others
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.181.10] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it compiles well and I have nothed nothing breaking here :)
 sonne|work	then pull request and I merge
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, I will rebase first to introduce changes from yesterday midday
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think it is a good idea to merge since in that way uricamic, wiking and I know how each other is working
 n4nd0	what will be good since our projects are somewhat related
 wiking	anybody seen alex around today?
 sonne|work	wiking: no ...
 wiking	:(
 wiking	we suppose to have a meeting now
 wiking	or at least today
 sonne|work	wiking: hmmmh?
 sonne|work	email him :)
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah we've agreed it via email ;P
 sonne|work	no email him now again reminding him
 n4nd0	by the way, does any of you see this warning when compiling?
 n4nd0	./../shogun/lib/DynamicArray.h:296: Warning 516: Overloaded method shogun::CDynamicArray< char >::element(int32_t,int32_t,int32_t) ignored,
 n4nd0	../../shogun/lib/DynamicArray.h:284: Warning 516: using shogun::CDynamicArray< char >::element(int32_t,int32_t,int32_t) const instead.
 n4nd0	it appears quite a lot of times here
 sonne|work	n4nd0: with swig you mean?
 sonne|work	yeah no idea why we need the const one...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I don't know if it is a problem with SWIG or something different
 n4nd0	and I am not sure if it is something that happens to me locally
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well if you compile with ./configure --interface=
 sonne|work	this warning shouldn't be there
 n4nd0	I am compiling with ./configure --interface=python_modular --disable-optimization --disable-doxygen
 n4nd0	mmmm maybe --integerface=pyton_modular was not there the last time
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, I've just compiled with --interfaces= and no warnings :) thank you!
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well you usually (before doing a pull request) should compile it with one static and one modular interface
 sonne|work	otherwise lots of errors slip through
 n4nd0	ok
 sonne|work	n4nd0: can we have a better name than VanillaStructuredOutputMachine?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 sonne|work	what is a vanilla machine?
 sonne|work	ice cream :)
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	we are using there the optimization algorithm that we have designated as "vanilla"
 n4nd0	I guess because it is the most straighforward or naive one, not because of its taste :P
 n4nd0	mmm let me see
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I first thought you meant the SOMachine
 sonne|work	but then I realized that there is SOMachine -> linearsomachien -> vanillasomachine
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	sonne|work: check here http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/
 n4nd0	there is a class diagram in the last post that will make you see the design faster
 n4nd0	sonne|work: now I realize that it probably makes sense to have the weight vector in LinearSOMachine instead of in VanillaSOMachine
 sonne|work	yeah ok but we need some better term than vanilla
 sonne|work	n4nd0: anyway I am merging right now but please fix both the 'vanilla' and w -> linearsomachine
 n4nd0	sonne|work: any suggestion instead of vanilla?
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8b0279c / (28 files in 5 dirs): Merge pull request #551 from iglesias/so (+18 more commits...) - http://git.io/rBhtYw
 sonne|work	n4nd0: what does 'vanilla' do ?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: nice blog
 sonne|work	I have to add it to planet tonight
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it is the algorithm Nico wrote in the pdf he sent around
 sonne|work	n4nd0: which one
 sonne|work	there were many :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/shogun/so.pdf
 n4nd0	in the second page of the document
 n4nd0	Algorithm 1 (the only algorithm there)
 sonne|work	alright the primal solver
 sonne|work	unconstrained optimzation problem ?
 n4nd0	there are constraints
 n4nd0	although they are not written in the algorithm
 sonne|work	ok
 n4nd0	they appear in equation (1), using the output of init_op
 n4nd0	but I think that, even if the formulation that appears there is for the primal, this same algorithm can be used for the dual
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I think you should change then name completely then
 sonne|work	I mean drop the SOMachine part
 n4nd0	in the paper they do it with the dual IIRC
 sonne|work	and invent something like libsvm :)
 n4nd0	I would like to have the SO part though
 sonne|work	n4nd0: will you be using mosek for it?
 n4nd0	this is something that works for SO since we are using this Delta loss function and the combined featuers
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hopefully
 n4nd0	I need some help with the formulation of the optimization problem, I am supposed to talk to Nico about it now around here ...
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yeah but suffixing with the machine name unecessary makes the name longer

 nicococo	hi n4nd0
 n4nd0	hey nicococo, how is it going?
 nicococo	medium to well :)
 nicococo	how is the toolbox progressing?
 n4nd0	so so+
 n4nd0	I am kind of stuck with the optimization part
 nicococo	hehe.. what can i do to help speed it up?
 n4nd0	so I don't know how to translate a couple of terms in our optimization problem to mosek
 n4nd0	the first one I already asked you by mail, but I think I didn't get that much the answer
 n4nd0	so we have this
 n4nd0	min_w 1/2 w'?C?w + sum_i l(...)
 nicococo	jupp
 n4nd0	where l is loss function evaluated in this expression max_y
 n4nd0	you know which one I mean right?
 nicococo	okay and the optimizer has the following form:
 nicococo	min_x 0.5 x'Hx + f'x .. right
 nicococo	?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	with a constant term too
 n4nd0	but yes, that's it
 nicococo	the trick here is: 1. we don't use the unconstraint version
 nicococo	which means we have:  0.5w'Cw + sum_i slack_i
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	all you have to do know is to add one constraint per iteration per example to the Ax <= b
 nicococo	now, we have to setup the optimization variable x which is a block variable
 nicococo	x = [w, slacks]
 nicococo	then f = ones(N,1)
 sonne|work	nicococo: hey there - do you have an idea for a short but more reasonable name than VanillaSOMachine?
 nicococo	i like vanilla... don't you
 sonne|work	no the name is too long
 n4nd0	VanillaSVM
 sonne|work	we have CPLEXSvm :)
 n4nd0	or VanillaSOSVM
 nicococo	fine with me
 sonne|work	not vanilla though
 sonne|work	it doesn't say anything
 n4nd0	it says that it is basic
 sonne|work	nicococo: don't you have a name for that problem?
 nicococo	BasicPrimalSOSVM
 nicococo	?
 sonne|work	a lot better to digest
 sonne|work	does it need SVM?
 sonne|work	in the name?
 sonne|work	otherwise we take this
 nicococo	BasicPrimal is not a good name without SOSVM, right?
 sonne|work	err if yes
 sonne|work	nicococo: you can also think up names like svmlight, torch, libsvm or whatever
 n4nd0	nicococo: I don't understand why f turns out to be a vector of ones
 nicococo	cool, what abaout VanillaSOSVM ;)
 n4nd0	:D
 sonne|work	nicococo: when we meet again next time ....DANGER
 sonne|work	nicococo: will this use mosek?
 nicococo	i'm not really scared :)   and yes, mosek it is
 sonne|work	PrimalMosekSOSVM then
 nicococo	alright
 n4nd0	agree
 nicococo	okay back to ones vector?
 n4nd0	nicococo: so how it turns out that f = ones(N,1)?
 n4nd0	for me that looks like
 nicococo	youre right it is a zero ones vector
 n4nd0	min w'Cw + w
 sonne|work	nicococo: did you see Alexander today? wiking was looking for him said that they wanted to meet in chat..
 nicococo	no, we have x = [w;slacks]
 nicococo	sonney, i can give him a hint
 n4nd0	nicococo: zero ones vector?
 nicococo	okay, so x = [w;slacks] and min_x 0.5 x'Hx + f'x
 n4nd0	slacks is empty at the beginning or?
 nicococo	if f =[zeros(len(w),1); ones(N,1)] then we have sum_i slacks_i
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I understand what you mean :)
 nicococo	cool ;)
 n4nd0	so this vector x has always the same dimensions
 nicococo	then H = [C,zeros(N);zeros(N),zeros(N)] right?
 nicococo	x has always dim = len(w) + num_examples
 n4nd0	agree
 nicococo	when you generate a new constraint then you add a line to A and b
 n4nd0	mmm, ok wait a moment there
 n4nd0	we have two types of constraints
 nicococo	where A = [-psi_i +psi_i(y_argmax) -delta_i(y_argmax), ...]
 nicococo	two types?
 n4nd0	Aw <= a
 n4nd0	and
 n4nd0	Bw = b
 nicococo	no, we have Ax <= b
 nicococo	and thats enough we don't need the equality constraint
 n4nd0	mmmm
 nicococo	and we have a lower bound for slacks
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	so is it like Ax <= b includes also the equality constraint?
 n4nd0	or it shouldn't be there in the pdf
 nicococo	which equality constraint you mean?
 n4nd0	in the pdf you wrote
 n4nd0	nicococo: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/shogun/so.pdf
 nicococo	oh..  in the pdf was a very general version .. all constraints there are for applications only..
 nicococo	here: 1. we drop all the constaints i wrote in the pdf
 nicococo	and 2. we make the unconstraint version constraint again by introducing slacks
 nicococo	hence, we have inequality constraints again
 nicococo	is that clear?
 n4nd0	I don't understand why to introduce the slacks as in x = [w; slacks]
 n4nd0	makes that inequality contraints like Ax <= b appear
 nicococo	we introduce the slacks because otherwise we cannot solve it with the QP solver
 n4nd0	yes, I understand that
 n4nd0	but I don't understand why if we have something without contraints
 n4nd0	why then Ax <= b appears
 n4nd0	I have clear the min x'Hx + f'x part
 n4nd0	how we have get there from min w'Cw + sum_i ...
 nicococo	sometimes in some application you may want to introduce some restrictions to your variables in w.. like the w(20) <= 10 or whatever
 nicococo	was that your question?
 n4nd0	but those are lb <= w <= ub constraints
 nicococo	..or how do we get from the unconstraint to the constraint version..
 nicococo	(ps. what about w(20)-w(19)<=10)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so what about A and b in Ax <= b
 n4nd0	you said something about adding rows and cols
 nicococo	w'psi_i - w'psi_yhat >= delta_yi_yhat - slack_i
 nicococo	well, this is one line in Ax <= b, right?
 n4nd0	yes
 nicococo	okay, so is everything clear?
 n4nd0	nicococo: yeah ... kind of :)
 nicococo	if you have more questions, please ask :)
 n4nd0	nicococo: I will try to formulate the problem for mosek
 n4nd0	I think I should be able to do it with this new info you have given to me
 n4nd0	although I don't know where some of the terms given by init_op, like A, a, B and b are used
 nicococo	the new constraint would be:  -delta >= w'psi_y_hat - w'psi_i - slack_i
 n4nd0	and this is a bit dangerous now since there are two different things called A (and the same for b)
 nicococo	ohh.. right. Ax <= a
 nicococo	in many applications A,a,B,b are empty in the beginning and C=eye(len(w))
 n4nd0	nicococo: ok, I think I can forget about them for the moment
 nicococo	and in PrimalMosekSOSVM we don't handle equality constraints Bx = b
 n4nd0	agree?
 nicococo	agree
 n4nd0	I don't have clear one point
 n4nd0	about Ax <= b
 n4nd0	what are the training examples that have to be included there?
 nicococo	psi(x_i,y_i) ?
 n4nd0	let's put it in another way
 n4nd0	Ax <= b represents constraints that we use like w'psi_y_Hat - w'psi_i <= -delta + slack_i
 n4nd0	each i is a training example
 n4nd0	what are the training examples that we have to include?
 n4nd0	mmm I don't think I am making it very clear :S
 nicococo	agree
 n4nd0	:D
 nicococo	:)
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	aah!!!
 n4nd0	A and b in Ax <=b, do they always have the same size?
 nicococo	i think i know what you mean
 nicococo	A is growing one line per iteration and b is growing too
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	in the first iteration, the first time we solve the QP, how are they?
 nicococo	in the first iteration, you first add num_examples constraints therefor A has num_examples lines
 nicococo	then you solve it
 n4nd0	how does A and b look like at the beginning?
 n4nd0	if we have no w initially, how do we get y_hat?
 nicococo	w =zeros
 nicococo	or rand or something else we get from the pre-solver
 n4nd0	ok, and we just predict with that
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	yepp, the first iteration will give us really bad estimates certainly
 n4nd0	and then, what are the constraints that are added, one per iteration?
 nicococo	one per example per iteration
 n4nd0	which example is added? the one with max loss?
 nicococo	for each example add constraint if it produces more slack than all the constraints added for the current example
 n4nd0	so in the pdf, Vanilla primal-SO-SVM
 n4nd0	this is what is done in lines 7-9
 n4nd0	?
 nicococo	yes, looks cryptic but is actually easy

 blackburn	be back in 30 mins
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh yes that is him :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, I don't have blog. :(
 gsomix	sonney2k, I will give the results for director classes tomorrow.
 gsomix	but I cannot be at meeting. labs, labs, labs. last labs =____=
 gsomix	I'm very sorry for that.
@sonney2k	hmmhh too bad :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah same here
@sonney2k	blackburn, I finally understand the error though - but no idea how to fix it currently
 gsomix	sonney2k, crazy russians universities :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: well one thing I think is wrong is rename for apply()
 blackburn	all machines have apply() and apply(CFeatures* data)
 blackburn	however i tried that and it didn't help
 blackburn	but I still believe it is something wrong
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r168604a / src/interfaces/modular/Machine.i : fix %renames to not remove %extend'ed applies - http://git.io/YldzpA
@sonney2k	blackburn, please check if you multiclass liblinear works now
@sonney2k	I mean x.apply_multiclass() gives same result as x.apply()
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: does apply work now?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	very good
* sonney2k is off for a swim
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes all is ok now
 blackburn	lets check.sh
 blackburn	I am impressed
 blackburn	battleshogun operational
 blackburn	ok I think we need apply_structured
 blackburn	fits perfectly

@sonney2k	all good, fresh and relaxed I am back :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have to make a decision about static interfaces
 puffin444	by the way, I got to present at Google Chicago last night.
 blackburn	sonney2k: which decision?
@sonney2k	currently the command there is set_labels', 'TRAIN', lab)
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	puffin444: and how it was?
 puffin444	blackburn: It was fun. The talks only lasted five minutes so I didn't get to say much
@sonney2k	now we need to specify the label type
@sonney2k	blackburn, question is how do we do it
@sonney2k	I mean we have to break the interface I am afraid
 blackburn	sonney2k: automagically!
@sonney2k	blackburn, can we do that?
 blackburn	sonney2k: why not - just add some function that dispatches: if (-1,+1) then create binary
 blackburn	else regression
 blackburn	orr?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I didn't see the beginning
 blackburn	do we support multiclass at all?
@sonney2k	got disconnected ...
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: we can add function there
 blackburn	that dispatches
 blackburn	if {-1,1} then binary
 blackburn	if {0,1,..} then multiclass
 blackburn	else regression
@sonney2k	ahh ok... I thought we do it more clever
 blackburn	how?
 blackburn	ok we can add some factory actually
@sonney2k	by checking if the machine needs a certain label type
@sonney2k	we create the label only then
 blackburn	no that's too complicated I think
@sonney2k	with correct type
 blackburn	however can be done too
 blackburn	I like both
 blackburn	puffin444: so do they liked shogun? :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: what do you think about apply_structured
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it should be done like that indeed
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.181.10] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 puffin444	blackburn: Yes, they were impressed by such an international team (We have 7+ countries represented)
 blackburn	hmm really?
 n4nd0	blackburn: to follow the same structure there
 n4nd0	puffin444: oh true, how did you presentation go?
 n4nd0	your*
 puffin444	n4nd0: It went well. I was actually able to sort of explain generally GPs in only five mins
 n4nd0	nice
 puffin444	Their office in Chicago has a beautiful view
@sonney2k	puffin444, do you have the slides somewhere?
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is one problem
@sonney2k	we have a labels load function
 puffin444	sonney2k: Yes, I do.
 puffin444	sonne2k: All four of them :)
 blackburn	load like load from file?
@sonney2k	so we need the label type before
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	puffin444, care to share?
 puffin444	sonney2k: sure, Do I put them on the mailinglist or somehow transfer them through irc?
@sonney2k	puffin444, some official post on the mailinglist would be nice - but you can also put them somewhere and link to them
@sonney2k	puffin444, or even blog about it on shogun planet :D
 blackburn	I actually would like to present shogun somewhere too :D
 blackburn	(okay I admit it can be an easy way to visit some country for free)
 blackburn	:D
 puffin444	sonney2k: I could try blogging about it. How do I get subscription access to shogun planet?
@sonney2k	puffin444, create a blog/rss feed somewhere and tell me the feed url
@sonney2k	blackburn, most certainly welcome :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah just need to find some conference I think?
@sonney2k	and get travel money from uni or so
@sonney2k	blackburn, my proposal wrt loading labels is
@sonney2k	I load regression labels
@sonney2k	and then we do the automagic conversion again
 blackburn	hmm yes makes sense

 blackburn	oh
 puffin444	hey chris
 puffin444	eating lunch. be back later.

@sonney2k	blackburn, there is an issue with the automagic label stuff
@sonney2k	currently our exmaples use +1/-1 labels for regression
@sonney2k	blackburn, so what do we do now?
@sonney2k	create examples with real valued labels?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm or act in the way you suggested
 blackburn	depending on machine

@sonney2k	blackburn, any idea how to add anything to data?
@sonney2k	I did add regression labels
 blackburn	sonney2k: to data like?
@sonney2k	but git push sais everything up-to-date
 blackburn	ah shogun-data?
@sonney2k	y
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm probably you didn't 'activate' it as git repo
 blackburn	I tried to remove toy here
 blackburn	sonney2k: git submodule update --init?
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r99a35be / (13 files in 6 dirs): fix static interfaces - http://git.io/TYtpIQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, no I mean I want to add the data set
@sonney2k	commit & push it to shogun-data
@sonney2k	but it claims that this repo is up-to-date
@sonney2k	even though I have the new data set in there now
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes - because it considers data as main git
 shogun-buildbot	build #990 of libshogun is complete: Failure [failed git]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/990  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	is it fresh clone? did you set up submodules?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I go to shogun/data
@sonney2k	how do I convince git that this is not part of shogun/ ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes but did you 'git submodule update --init' in shogun/?
 blackburn	or somehow
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah to fetch the data
@sonney2k	then I modified the data
@sonney2k	committed
 blackburn	hmm that's strange then
@sonney2k	added a new remote
@sonney2k	and push now says f... you
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	sonney2k: one idea
 blackburn	sonney2k: git status?
 blackburn	# Not currently on any branch.
 blackburn	right?
 blackburn	save your data and recommit if so
@sonney2k	yeah indeed
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r23dfd86 / data : add new data - http://git.io/p60e2w
 blackburn	sonney2k: interesting fact it all goes to valhalla if not on branch
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah sometimes git is dangerous
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r7866158 / (2 files): forgot .dat suffix - http://git.io/71UatQ

 shogun-buildbot	build #991 of libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/991
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh
@sonney2k	clever me :D
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: any idea how to boost accuracy for 0.5-1%?
 blackburn	multiclass, you know
@sonney2k	gsomix, in case you get the director kernels to work there is another cool python feature (python buffer protocol) that we all want :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I desperately need to get 0.98 instead of 0.97 :D
 blackburn	maybe some tricks?
@sonney2k	no clue
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha, aha.
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you fix these warnings http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/991/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%282%29
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	sonney2k: any idea why liblinear computing time -> infty after prunevarsubmean?
@sonney2k	no
 shogun-buildbot	build #893 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/893
 blackburn	hmm my issues are all strange
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh and I think we need you to turn on the tests afterwards ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: which normalization is better for linear SVM? 1/2?
 gsomix	sonney2k, which tests?
 shogun-buildbot	build #782 of octave_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/782
@sonney2k	blackburn, depends on problem sqrtdiag quite often
@sonney2k	but it also helps to use binneddotfeatures
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is advantage of using binned features?
@sonney2k	you can learn piece wise linear functions
@sonney2k	so with enough bins basically any function
@sonney2k	works pretty well
@sonney2k	and no normalization issues
 shogun-buildbot	build #859 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/859

@sonney2k	how do we disable that bot?
@sonney2k	blackburn, is that your grisly?
 PolarBearAttack	let me be part of the society?
 blackburn	hmm I did not recognize it as bot :D
 blackburn	PolarBearAttack: are you?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it might dangerous to kick polar bears :D
@sonney2k	true
@sonney2k	they can bite
@sonney2k	PolarBearAttack, can you?
 PolarBearAttack	I'm coherent, I will contribute
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you please describe how can I appoach anything with binned features?
@sonney2k	blackburn, are you coherent and will contribute?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I promise I will
@sonney2k	PolarBearAttack, see
@sonney2k	blackburn, has a grisly at his home
@sonney2k	we are not afraid...
@sonney2k	blackburn, you have to give it the bins
 PolarBearAttack	Can people talk in terms of mathematics?
 blackburn	PolarBearAttack: f(x)
@sonney2k	there is an example
@sonney2k	have a look
 blackburn	sonney2k: bins like [0,1] (1,2]
 blackburn	right?
@sonney2k	I think so
@sonney2k	blackburn, how many dims do you have?
 blackburn	sonney2k: depends how many hog cells I have but generally varying from 200 to 900
@sonney2k	PolarBearAttack, f(x)=\sum_i \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x)
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you can easily use 100 bins per feature
@sonney2k	blackburn, how many examples?
 PolarBearAttack	sonney2k: , how did you formulate that thought?
 blackburn	sonney2k: 39K
@sonney2k	not so many
 blackburn	hmm I could generate some with rotations, etc :D
@sonney2k	PolarBearAttack, I used a brain computer interface
