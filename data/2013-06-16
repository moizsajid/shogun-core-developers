@sonney2k	iglesiasg, around?
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey!
 gsomix	sonney2k: hello. :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, lisitsyn do you have time tomorrow evening to finish the workshop schedule?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes
@HeikoS	which time?
@sonney2k	evening
@HeikoS	sonney2k: currently working on the Satzung btw
@HeikoS	ok I am free from 6pm German time
@sonney2k	say 18:30 UTC
@HeikoS	sonney2k: mainly copying KDE's one
@HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	we should finish the schedule and then send around an email to participants
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I aggree!
@sonney2k	seems like we got 26 or so registered people so about 30 it will be then I guess.
@sonney2k	I am currently trying to figure out how we get any video recording done
@sonney2k	lets see
@HeikoS	nice
 gsomix	sonney2k: what's the plan for further work?
 lisitsyn	re
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah if it doesn't take a lot of time
@sonney2k	gsomix, did I miss anything?
@sonney2k	gsomix, are you done with the line reader now?
 gsomix	sonney2k: yep. It's tested and documented.
@HeikoS	wiking: any news for the cloneing tests?
@sonney2k	gsomix, where is the test?
@sonney2k	gsomix, I see the example but please also make a test for both circular buffer and line reader under tests/unit/io
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: hey!
@sonney2k	hey iglesiasg!
@sonney2k	seen that you got an email?
@sonney2k	let me pm you
 gsomix	sonney2k: ahhh, my fault. did not know about tests/...
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah we are enforcing this now to keep things working
 gsomix	sonney2k: ok.
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, oki thanks!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, lisitsyn - iglesiasg is now managing our mailinglists
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: how?
 lisitsyn	what kind of management?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: nice thanks! :)
@HeikoS	you did a great job twittering already :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I have got to accept what mails get in and what mails don't
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: thanks! :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: oh like pre-moderating?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: at least that is what I have done right now -- just remove some spam messages
@HeikoS	sonney2k: do you have lyx on your machine?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I see
@HeikoS	sonney2k: shared the Satzung with you

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah nothing on todo
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey there
 gsomix	sonney2k: mmm?
@sonney2k	gsomix, we have to think about something we can show / demonstrate as a result of your code.
@sonney2k	I know it is rather technical so maybe some technical demo then
@sonney2k	gsomix, e.g. a performance comparison in reading .csv / libsvm files or sth
@HeikoS	sonney2k: was that you?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sorry what?
@HeikoS	dbox
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I just kicked somebody out
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah sorry that probably was gunnar
 gsomix	sonney2k: benchmarks and examples will enough, I think. maybe some "real life" examples.
@sonney2k	HeikoS, do you have *any* idea what real-life example for a task such as the one gsomix is doing (readers / writers for standard file formats) could be?
@HeikoS	ehm sorry what?
 gsomix	sonney2k: there is one question. we need some another (not shogun, I mean) code for comparsion.
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I hope you remember that for the next meeting we wanted to present real life examples that could be done for gsoc projects
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	so which formats do you do?
@sonney2k	gsomix, well libsvm / svmlight / time cat file >/dev/null / etc
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well first of all ascii to perfection (.csv) then later arff and matlab
@sonney2k	reader + writer
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah csv should be priority
@sonney2k	it will need some refactoring in C*File*
@HeikoS	well then just load some dataset?
@HeikoS	and do some cool thing with it
@HeikoS	or translate formats maybe?
@HeikoS	that would be a nice idea
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you mean standard data sets?
 lisitsyn	yes translating sounds like a good idea
@sonney2k	HeikoS, hmmhh we have that in mldata-utils already
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah, make an example how to use shogun for all these std datasets for classificaiton outthere
@HeikoS	but there is more than mldata
@sonney2k	HeikoS, mldata-utils!
@sonney2k	general converter from format X -> Y
@sonney2k	csv -> matlab
@sonney2k	etc etc
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	then load a single dataset from different files?
@HeikoS	most people give me data in csv
@HeikoS	or in matlab
@HeikoS	or csv without comas
@sonney2k	yeah and maybe some size comparison and compression
@sonney2k	good enough
@sonney2k	gsomix, heard the man? We can do a) benchmarks as in just how fast reading / writing is (maybe comparing it to others but not necessary IMHO if we compare to cat file >/dev/null)
@sonney2k	b) do an application that converts format x -> y
@sonney2k	c) load in standard data sets with our reader and run some machine on it
@sonney2k	good enough IMHO
 gsomix	sonney2k: yes, sir. got it.
 gsomix	:)
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw how difficult would it be to make it more generic as in read data from URL or even allow on-the-fly (de-)compression?
 gsomix	sonney2k: hm, hard to tell. need to research.
 gsomix	sonney2k: but if there are something like stream system with reading functions - not difficult.
@sonney2k	gsomix, or reading from a pipe so someone could do cat file | my_streaming_shogun_app or replace cat with wget -O -
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	HeikoS, do you have access to shogun-publicity git?
 gsomix	sonney2k: with pipes it's not difficult.
@sonney2k	gsomix, but you cannot use FILE then or?
@sonney2k	don't you need fd?
 gsomix	sonney2k: yep, I need. then we can make reader more configurable.
 gsomix	add something like source_type value
 gsomix	and ther work with either FILE, or fd.
 gsomix	*then
@HeikoS	sonney2k: not that I know
* gsomix is trying call to memory lections about linux at uni...
@sonney2k	gsomix,        FILE *fdopen(int fd, const char *mode);
@sonney2k	looks like what you need then
 gsomix	sonney2k: cool!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, shall I add the .lyx file or can you do it under the folder foundation ?
@HeikoS	sonney go ahead and add it, my father just called :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, done
@HeikoS	nice :) maybe you can read it and then send it to the others for feedback
@sonney2k	HeikoS, when we have a Satzung (you copy & paste one is pretty nice btw) - what else do we need to do?
@iglesiasg	good night people
@HeikoS	sonney2k: see mail
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: good night!
-!- iglesiasg [d58f3254@gateway/web/freenode/ip.213.143.50.84] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@sonney2k	HeikoS, which mail?
@HeikoS	I just sent one
@sonney2k	HeikoS, didn't get it yet
@sonney2k	HeikoS, better ask the KDE guys
@HeikoS	debian.org
@sonney2k	about copy&paste
@HeikoS	will do
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ohh and btw lets cut darlehen from 10.000 -> 0
@sonney2k	agreed?
@HeikoS	yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I don't get what you write about Vorstand
@sonney2k	it seems like 3 people are needed
@sonney2k	but only 2 are mentioned?
@sonney2k	shouldn't it be 2 -> 3?
@HeikoS	kde has 7
@HeikoS	has to be at least 1 by law :)
@HeikoS	we can do any number
@sonney2k	ok then lets put 3 there
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we should maybe also look how CCC e.V. and c-base e.V. do it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, and maybe the name shogun-toolbox e.V. is not good? I mean shouldn't it be more parseable for people not knowing the name?
@HeikoS	sonney thats both fine
@HeikoS	maybe add a not to the lyx
@HeikoS	note
@sonney2k	as in 'Verein zur foerderung freier wissenschaftlicher Software" ?
@sonney2k	maybe with added " insbesondere im Bereich des Maschinellen Lernens"
@sonney2k	but yes shogun-toolbox / shogun e.V. at the end makes sense
@sonney2k	HeikoS, didn't get your email, please resend to my shogun-toolbox.org address
@sonney2k	HeikoS, anyway I did my pass and committed
