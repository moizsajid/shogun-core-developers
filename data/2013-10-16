 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i'll do it today
 wiking	besser82: yo any news?
 besser82	wiking: Hi! not yet :(
 besser82	wiking: Any news about releasedate-timeline?
 wiking	besser82: well ASAP :)
 wiking	so i think we'll have your cmake patch in 3.1
 besser82	wiking: ahh, alright :)
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.98.226] has joined #shogun
 sonne|osx	besser82: hey good morning!
 sonne|osx	besser82: wiking was asking yesterday what the cloud status is
 besser82	sonne|osx: hello! Good morning  :D
 sonne|osx	besser82: and I am asking what the cmake file status is :)
 besser82	sonne|osx: Yes, he already asked me, but still no news.  Will poke nirik after he woke up ;)
 sonne|osx	besser82: btw I managed to get the overlay working more smoothly
 sonne|osx	besser82: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/notebook/
 besser82	sonne|osx: ahh, looks great :)
 sonne|osx	now we just need more notebooks and we need to put them under the image slide show thingy at the bottom of http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/home/
 sonne|osx	so when sb. clicks an image it will show the notebook in an overlay
 besser82	sonne|osx: sounds good. :)  Is there any news about release, yet?
 sonne|osx	looks like everyone is very busy currently :/
 sonne|osx	so our progress is slow
 sonne|osx	every day we make a little bit of progress at least
 sonne|osx	but it takes time
 besser82	sonne|osx: allrighty, so there's still a good chance to get (at least some parts of) the refactored cmake stuff in  :)
 sonne|osx	besser82: however, I will be with heiko on the plane to the gsoc summit and spend 1 week afterwards with him. so I hope we can have evning hack sessions
 sonne|osx	and maybe even a release (soon) afterwards
 wiking	sonne|osx: when r u guys out in sf?
 besser82	sonne|osx: sweet
 wiking	or which week?
 sonne|osx	wiking: not sf
 sonne|osx	but mountain view / sunnyvale and then whole CA
 sonne|osx	but this friday
 wiking	sonne|osx: ok so friday-friday?
 sonne|osx	so very soon
 sonne|osx	yeah
 wiking	ok so let's do the release after u guys are back?
 sonne|osx	my only time w/o kids and work
 sonne|osx	so the best chance to get things done
 wiking	ok
 wiking	sounds good
 wiking	anyhow u guys will be PST
 besser82	sonne|osx: Yeah near Palo Alto, then  ;)
 wiking	so we are going to be out of sync a bit
 sonne|osx	wiking: please give me some snapshot image for the demo to run in
 wiking	sonne|osx: yeah i'm refactoring it atm
 wiking	but will be ready by today
 wiking	along with the cloud infra
 sonne|osx	wiking: I mean I would even say that we don't really need it for the demos
 sonne|osx	I am not sure yet how I will integrate demo / website
 sonne|osx	would have wanted to do the same like we do with the notebook
 sonne|osx	but not so sure how to render a screen of a demo
 wiking	sonne|osx: u removed download tab?
 sonne|osx	wiking: yes
 sonne|osx	wiking: we should rename news to download
 sonne|osx	the download list was totally incomplete anyway
 sonne|osx	looks like the weather will be nice in CA
 sonne|osx	if it is too cold the pool party won't kick off / last long so fingers crossed
 sonne|osx	alrighty

 sonne|work	besser82: please really try to get some of the (non-intrusive not like .h and .cpp split) cmake changes in
 sonne|work	besser82: the sooner the better
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I managed to fix sliding
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm on it.
 besser82	sonne|work: This header - code split this one of the easiest parts...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I just checked it, cool
 besser82	sonne|work: Getting the whole autogeneration out of source-tree is more challenging
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: seen the 5s auto slide :)
 besser82	sonne|work: and the testsuite from inside build-tree as well....
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: now we just need to convert the graphical examples into notebooks
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: so we can have the images in there
@iglesiasg	oh cool, didn't notice the timer
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I mean images of the notebooks and then when one clicks it opens the overlay
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, it sounds nice yes
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: so if you have time convert some example!
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, the problem is that examples are just code and in the notebooks we write explanations too
 sonne|work	sure it is work
 sonne|work	but for example we need multiclass notebook
@iglesiasg	it is work and one has to know about the stuff it is writing about
 sonne|work	regression notebook with KRR / SVR
 sonne|work	etc
 sonne|work	I do but I seriously lack time
 besser82	sonne|work: the current checkout gives me loads of "undefined reference" for HDF5-symbols....
@iglesiasg	we are not in a rush anyway I guess
 sonne|work	maybe you continue with the website
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: we are...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, why so?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg:  maybe you continue with the website
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and I try with heiko to produce the notebooks on the plane
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, we should probably first take care of everything we need for release, not sure if we want to prioritize this right now
 sonne|work	besser82: not here...
 sonne|work	besser82: might be that link oder is wrong?
 sonne|work	besser82: I mean -lhdf5 should be at the end?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, produce notebooks on the plane?? graphical examples -> notebooks?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yes
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well prioritize - you know our list of todos - they are in the issue tracker
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: we need to make a good first appearance
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: for that to happen the website should be OKish
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and notebooks & demos should be in good state
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and matlab interface should compile
@iglesiasg	agree
@iglesiasg	matlab is important I think
 sonne|work	so IMHO presentation is most important now
 sonne|work	and some minor issues
 sonne|work	wiking: any idea how to fix matlab?
@iglesiasg	but we already have a bunch of notebooks, at least 4-5
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: not enough
@iglesiasg	so probably to produce new ones does not make a big change to create this good first appearance
@iglesiasg	I see
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well we have some screens to fill and shogun has tons of features so we can do this
 sonne|work	I guess I can enrich that with the demos
 sonne|work	so we have maybe 10 or so now
 sonne|work	though we could easily get 20
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm currently rebuilding with redirecting to log-file....
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, still, I think this should be pushed to the tasks queue but not with highest priority  :)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: what is high prio in your opinion then?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, fix issues related to broken interfaces and tests
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: which are?
@iglesiasg	Matlab
@iglesiasg	for the interfaces
@iglesiasg	and tests I think that Python modular has been long failing in travis
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: that is something wiking has to do so not something we can
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yeah heikos thing
 sonne|work	but that is little work
@iglesiasg	I am not sure about all the issues in GitHub for 3.0
 sonne|work	as I said for me it presentation that is primarily important
 sonne|work	all the rest is can be done later stuff now

 sonne|work	besser82: I don't see any hdf lib in the linker line?!
 sonne|work	besser82: so looks like it did not get added to linker flags
 besser82	sonne|work: mhh, strange...
 besser82	sonne|work: but thanks for confirming...
 besser82	sonne|work: I'll investigate that and put it on my TODO for refactored cmake...

@HeikoS	sonney2k: hi!
@HeikoS	should we do the seating now?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the plan would be to do a couple more notebooks
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I managed to get the overlay to work properly
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so we should IMHO use the preview images at the bottom for our demo
@sonney2k	s
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, could you please convert your http://shogun-toolbox.org/bigpicture/swissroll.png to a notebook?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the examples you have are too nice to be left out
