@wiking	besser82: yo
 besser82	wiking: ya!
@wiking	besser82: so i'm just preparing a docker file for shogun
@wiking	besser82: do u know how to setup docker for fedora?
 besser82	wiking: not yet, but I can someone who is more affine with infra....
@wiking	besser82: these are the requirements: http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/kernel/#kernel
@wiking	for kernel
@wiking	besser82: fedora infra uses openstack?
@wiking	http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-announce/2013-October/000151.html
@wiking	has native docker support

@wiking	lisitsyn: yo
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
@wiking	lisitsyn: do u have repo creation permissions for shogun-toolbox user on github?
 lisitsyn	wiking: lemme check
@wiking	lisitsyn: btw: do u know this: http://docker.io/
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'm just trying to put together a Dockerfile for this in order to have shogun+notebooks
@wiking	it's pretty great stuff
@wiking	unfortunately it's not tooo much native support
@wiking	i.e. only linux
@wiking	but others can use vagrant
@wiking	like i'm doing now
 lisitsyn	wiking: it doesn't look I have such permissions
@wiking	:(
 lisitsyn	about docker - no idea actually
@wiking	lisitsyn: check this out: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/master/README.md
@wiking	this is the most interesting of the whole stuff: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/master/README.md#better-than-vms
 lisitsyn	wiking: ha, another thing written in go
@wiking	indeed :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: sometimes I think we should use go too
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	:D
@wiking	of course :P
@wiking	ok now the question where should we store nightly packages on the website?
@wiking	we shoudl totally have like
@wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/download
@wiking	or http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/downloads
@wiking	and http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/download/nightly
@wiking	any insights?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am ok with any
@wiking	ok i'll check how this can be done

@wiking	ok
@wiking	where should we store the dockerfile
@wiking	should we just include it in the source repo?
@wiking	although anyway this image is going to be here: https://index.docker.io/

 thoralf	Hey all.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hey
 thoralf	Quite empty in here.
 thoralf	I expected a crowded channel and everyone looking forward to work on the release. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, sure thing
 lisitsyn	thoralf: ha
 lisitsyn	no money no honey
@sonney2k	wiking, shouldn't we put nightly releases just under ftp://shogun-toolbox.org/shogun/nightly/ ?
@sonney2k	wiking, or snapshots/
@sonney2k	with this scheme
@sonney2k	shogun-3.0.0~git20131021.8dfde37
@sonney2k	which is from this logic: VER=3.0.0
@sonney2k	GITVER=`date +%Y%m%d`.`cd shogun ; git log -1 --pretty=%h`
@sonney2k	DESTDIR=shogun_${VER}~git$GITVER
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, thoralf, wiking, besser82 btw what would you want to mentor for next years gsoc?
 lisitsyn	sure why not sonney2k
 besser82	sonney2k: Sure! I can do it :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and an idea what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sorry :D
 lisitsyn	skipped 'what' part
 lisitsyn	I'd go for internals!
@sonney2k	besser82, with heiko we thought you might be interested in some shogun & cloud part :)
 lisitsyn	change guts of shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, like what?
 besser82	sonney2k: That would be great!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: parameters, serialization, parallel/distributed stuff
 besser82	lisitsyn: How about getting rid of SVMlight sh*t?
 lisitsyn	oh well I have no expertise in svms to be honest
@sonney2k	besser82, we thought about that too - possible but tough
@sonney2k	besser82, one would have to pimp gpdt svm
@sonney2k	and honestly I am not sure if it is worth it
 besser82	sonney2k: and we can fine someone with expertise in this...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ah yes and I still think shogun should become client/server app :D
 besser82	sonney2k: So cloud / distributed / OpenCL computation is mine, then  ;)
 lisitsyn	the 'training' part
 lisitsyn	I believe this is the killer
 besser82	lisitsyn: can be done with ease when we get some distributed computation running ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: like in next year's gsoc  ;)
@sonney2k	well think of something very concrete that can be done in <3months
@sonney2k	with some easy entrance projects upfront
 lisitsyn	I would do that by myself but give me the money ;)
 lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	with HeikoS I had an 8 hour drive yesterday down to the south
@sonney2k	so we came up with a loooong list of ideas and things
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: did HeikoS push you to the funding thing?
 lisitsyn	I mean he wanted to get some money to hire someone
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, errm it is not really that I am blocking him here
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I didn't say you are blocking it ;) just curious if you support that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, why should I block it?
@sonney2k	if he finds funding for any of us it would be good right?
 thoralf	sonney2k: In general I'm interested in large scale discriminative stuff (multilabel classification, SVMs) - but haven't a clue what direction I should move.
 thoralf	next
@sonney2k	thoralf, well think about sth you would want to have in shogun / or want to see fixed
@sonney2k	thoralf, I mean e.g. the streaming features framework etc might need some extension/overhaul
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sure pure good
@sonney2k	we need some kind of release script
@sonney2k	where should that go?
@sonney2k	main CMakefile.txt ?
@sonney2k	or some shell script?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Of course, streaming and sparse computations are essential, but it's infrastructure stuff.
 thoralf	sonney2k: I prefer working on use-cases and fix infrastructure "on the way". ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, any idea for a nice use case?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Multilabel classification.
 thoralf	:D
@sonney2k	ohh ordinal regression is sth I would want to have too
 thoralf	(Or tags or whatever you might call it...)
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah yeah
 lisitsyn	I'd go application-centric
@sonney2k	applications is seriously the best way to show off shogun's powers
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, if we had your traffic sign recognition thing as application that would be cool
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, one could even make a demo out of this
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I don't know how should it look like
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :develop * 6c23967 / README.md,README_developer.md: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/6c239672028335cde00a53dd0ce833f5a603cfe1
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: update readme and mention how to do a release in the developer readme
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: and when to change the soname.
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, some images with traffic signs can be uploaded - signs are located and classified
@sonney2k	but first things first
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: big thing actually
 lisitsyn	detection is an issue as well
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, we really need the dimred notebook for the release
 lisitsyn	for the release?!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I worked last night and night before last night :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, an it is easy to do given what you did for the tapkee
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, maybe fernando could do it?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I mean it is just takeing the code from graphical examples
 lisitsyn	I am a two weeks overdue with some thing
@sonney2k	and the descriptions from the website
 lisitsyn	yes fernando knows about it as well
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok then lets ask iglesiasg when he is online
 lisitsyn	I can draft a plan may be
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah just submit some notebook following the template and with some outline added
@sonney2k	thoralf, do you have any time to help?
 lisitsyn	okay I'll spend some time on that tomorrow I hope
 thoralf	sonney2k: As always yes and no. :)
@sonney2k	thoralf, alright let me say what I think is the only things missing for a proper release:
@sonney2k	bug count etc is in OK shape
@sonney2k	we only need to fix one issue and that is what Heiko needs to do here and will
@sonney2k	the remaining stuff is 'just' to get the notebook cloud thing going - but that is what wiking and besser82 are doing
@sonney2k	and to get some nice applications  / demos
@sonney2k	so people love us when they see us
@sonney2k	the rest is good enough(tm)
@sonney2k	so we need some more notebooks
@sonney2k	and polish the demos and integrate them into the main website
@sonney2k	thoralf, and for that I could use some help - I need some thumbnail images for the (already online) demos http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org/
@sonney2k	so I can place them at the bottom of our website
 thoralf	sonney2k: notebooks are a nice challenge - anything in particular?
@sonney2k	thoralf, there is tons of stuff one could do wrt notebooks. we have no general intros into anything
@sonney2k	so descriptions for regression, classification, clustering etc
 thoralf	sonney2k: And about the thumbnails - simply rendering the web page, taking a snapshot and shrinking it would be enough?
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes
@sonney2k	well ne
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	you unfortunately have to put some points there for regression
@sonney2k	to get some curve estimated
@sonney2k	otherwise it would just be some grid
@sonney2k	thoralf, but if you could do the notebooks I could ask van51 if he is up to helping out with the demos
 thoralf	sonney2k: I'll have a look on what we have and will try to do some basic notebooks.
@sonney2k	thoralf, thanks
 thoralf	sonney2k: Haven't used ipython notebooks yet, but HeikoS already did some great stuff to copy from. ;)
 thoralf	sonney2k: One last thing: Deadline.
* thoralf needs deadlines to get productive :D
@sonney2k	thoralf, use the template
@sonney2k	thoralf, iglesiasg created some template so just copy from that one
@sonney2k	thoralf, well do 1 notebook by end of today
@sonney2k	tomorrow
@sonney2k	sry
@sonney2k	which one?
 thoralf	sonney2k: I'm thinking of a toy example to show sparse features & streaming & hashing.  Plotting performance for different hash sizes.
@sonney2k	thoralf, makes sense
 thoralf	sonney2k: Any ideas/wishes?
 thoralf	Which dataset might be suitable, for example?
* thoralf can generate some random data as well.
@sonney2k	thoralf, problem if `real' data here would be that it would be huge - some spam vs non-spam thing for that would be nice
@sonney2k	well or some random stuff
 thoralf	Something high-dimensional, but sparse features would splitting natural language sentences into char-n-grams (n=2 or 3 would do).
 thoralf	Do we have text data?
 thoralf	Well, I'll do something.  No matter what.
@sonney2k	thoralf, well van51 has one notebook about that
@sonney2k	thoralf, http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/HashedDocDotFeatures.html
 shogun-buildbot	build #1973 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1973  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	thoralf, your notebook could go hand-in-hand with this one since it is only mentioning the streaming part as an extra
 thoralf	Btw. a typo in van51s notebook "Gunar R?atsch" (reference section ;))
 lisitsyn	R?
 lisitsyn	what?
 lisitsyn	R?R?R?R?
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	how does that sound :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, very male

@sonney2k	van51, hey!
 van51	sonney2k: hello
 van51	sonney2k: did you see my reply?
@sonney2k	van51, we are in pretty different timezones atm
@sonney2k	van51, not yet
 van51	sonney2k: what time is it there? 10am or 12am?
@sonney2k	10  yeah
@sonney2k	van51, just read your mail. very nice
@sonney2k	van51, well thumbnails first and then trying to get demos ready
 van51	sonney2k: ok
 van51	sonney2k: 140x105 ?
@sonney2k	van51, I mean there are still some flaws
@sonney2k	van51, same size like the others we currently have
@sonney2k	and van51 we can work on demos as long as we want
@sonney2k	van51, for now we need to get the release to be in good enough shape and then release though
 van51	sonney2k: ok sure. Maybe I'll check some issues then afterwards
@sonney2k	van51, for the screenshots you have to click some nice points together and then get some image back
@sonney2k	van51, and please describe your example more
@sonney2k	van51, so that it is clear that this was trained from a few wikipedia articles
@sonney2k	van51, best wishes from HeikoS btw
 van51	sonney2k: thx HeikoS, you too :)
 van51	sonney2k: are the asp and arts examples not supposed to be working?
 van51	sonney2k: asp works actually
 van51	sonney2k: can you give me a brief description of those two as well so I can make some intro text?
@sonney2k	van51, I will do the descr for these - the examples are not so cool display wise unfortunately
