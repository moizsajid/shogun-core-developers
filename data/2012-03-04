 Ram108	lol the math is kinnof confusing lol
 blackburn	not sure I've read it earlier
 Ram108	no issues i ll get it over a couple of iterations :)
 Ram108	oh hmmm :) lol
 Ram108	i have a more general doubt....
 Ram108	does google employ people with skill set in machine learning?
 Ram108	i d so love to work for google probably abt half a decade later wen i become good at it
 blackburn	no idea
 Ram108	just wondering if u wud know anything abt it?

 blackburn	wiking: 61%
 blackburn	vikram360: or you
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn: not happy with the results this far :P?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I would rather leave country than live in putin's russia
 n4nd0	blackburn: not good :( I'm sorry about that
 n4nd0	blackburn: does it really affect there the daily life of everyone?
 blackburn	not really
 n4nd0	I mean, when I was in Spain I liked more the ideas of some parties than others
 blackburn	ok let me describe
 n4nd0	but life was still the same whoever was in the power
 blackburn	there are a lot of corruption, so police can stop you and ask you for money because they can
 blackburn	it is some simple example :)
 blackburn	the most serious problem is we didn't elect him actually
 blackburn	there are some pro-putin guys, not so many though
 n4nd0	the thing of the police sounds quite bad
 blackburn	not only police but each goverment org
 blackburn	all putin's friends are multimillionaires
 blackburn	well finally we have a lot of oil and it costs unbelievable 120$, if we had no thieves in goverment we would live better
 blackburn	n4nd0: most of these 61% are people who were forced to elect putin
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=_vh18TEE2Ds
 blackburn	could you ever imagine that ^? :)
 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	I don't get what are they doing in the video
 n4nd0	what are those papers?
 blackburn	n4nd0: they fake election
 blackburn	n4nd0: those papers are voting papers

 blackburn	n4nd0: with this video - yes, they denied it
 blackburn	cancelled election in this town
 blackburn	but russia is pretty big you know
 vikram360	hey blackburn can you repost the video, I'm dealing with a broken connection and I think I missed the link
 blackburn	vikram360: this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=_vh18TEE2Ds
 n4nd0	vikram360: do you come from Russia too?
 blackburn	I guess no
 vikram360	blackburn : nope, but I'm intrigued by Russia. I come from a 'defence-ally' of russia : India
 blackburn	hah yeah main weapon vendor
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	oh unbelievable, they are saying such lies on tv now
 n4nd0	blackburn: e.g?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd call it in one theme: 'fuck liberals'
 vikram360	are russian media houses state owned?
 blackburn	yeah pretty controlled by gov't

 vikram360	that sucks
 vikram360	so do people believe that the election is staged?
 blackburn	I know no one believer
 vikram360	so that's a no?
 blackburn	sorry bad sentence probably
 blackburn	I know no one :)
 vikram360	that's weird. Because I thought that a lot of people didn't particularly like putin
 blackburn	oooh sorry
 blackburn	staged
 blackburn	vikram360: I know no one that is believing it is truth
 blackburn	62.55 already
 blackburn	growing
 vikram360	63.55 pc of votes in his favor?
 blackburn	I bet for 65%
 vikram360	geez ! but all said and done, that man is a freaggin alpha.
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 vikram360	Is he generally a nice guy? I mean, does he genuinely care about the people?
 blackburn	he is ok
 blackburn	not very bad, not very good
 blackburn	but we can't stand such high % - it is a lie
 vikram360	blackburn : I think one good thing about putin is that he manages to keep russia truly sovereign. India is sovereign only on paper.
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	well.. may be you are right but it costs too much for russia
 vikram360	blackburn : what do you mean?
 blackburn	vikram360: we have some troubles on the Caucasus, and he just keep sending a lot of money to save this integrity
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.96.0.3] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
 vikram360	Oh, ok, I didn't know that.
 blackburn	well, not the best way
 blackburn	vikram360: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Ws7wivahqg4 cortege of chechnya leader
 blackburn	probably not the best way to solve this problem :)
 vikram360	geez!!, that looked like regular traffic on an indian road.
 vikram360	The comments kinda give an idea about the sentiments in russia. They seem to hate his guts!
 vikram360	blackburn : so what is your background (If I may ask)
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 vikram360	are you a student ?
 blackburn	ah, yes
 blackburn	4th year undergraduate
 blackburn	of Samara State Aerospace University
 vikram360	oh... ok.. I'm 3rd year undergraduate at the PES School of Engineering, Bangalore. I'm studying computer science
 vikram360	So are you a contributor?
 blackburn	yeah, may be even a core developer
 vikram360	wow! that's awesome :)
 vikram360	I hope to be a contributor :)
 vikram360	So when did you get started with machine learning?
 blackburn	I have been studying it for 1.5 years probably
 vikram360	and you're now a core developer? that's awesome man!
 vikram360	blackburn : the man (in this case was a unisex filler and would remain relevant even if you were a woman :) )
 blackburn	well I just took participance in gsoc 2011 and continued to work with shogun
 blackburn	my name is Sergey Lisitsyn :)
 blackburn	so man
 vikram360	haha :) . My name is Vikram Kamath. I hope to get into GSoc this year. But I just want to make sure that this is a project that will keep me fulfilled even after GSoc.
 vikram360	So I decided to drop in and find out what the people are like. And so far, it's been extremely friendly :)
 vikram360	blackburn : are all educational institutions in Russia state owned?
 vikram360	I mean, I want to make sure that I will contribute to this project waaay after gsoc is over.
 blackburn	well feel free to contribute anytime :)
 blackburn	as for institutions, most of are
 vikram360	blackburn : I hope I have what it takes to contribute.
 vikram360	so does that mean there are private institutions too?
 blackburn	yeah some sort of, but pretty useless
 vikram360	then that's pretty awesome. Given the academic talent russia produces. Some of the programmers and mathematicians from russia are legendary.
 vikram360	Have you heard of the guy petr mitrichev?
 blackburn	not really, what did he do?
 vikram360	he's this wunderkind programmer from russia who wins almost every single programming contest there is!
 vikram360	facebook hacker cup , google code jam, ACM ICPC, you name it!
 blackburn	hmm probably he is a smart guy hah :)
 vikram360	yes! , he is!
 vikram360	lol
 vikram360	blackburn : If I may ask, how did you start contributing to shogun?
 blackburn	I started to contribute just before gsoc 2011
 vikram360	ok.. how long before gsoc 2011?
 blackburn	well year ago probably
 vikram360	a year before gsoc 2011? that's awesome man!
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	year ago before now :)
 vikram360	that makes that a few days before gsoc 2011?
 vikram360	that gives me hope :) :) :)
 blackburn	yes, IIRC I contacted Soeren at March, 28
 vikram360	oh.. ok. and what project did you work on?
 blackburn	dimensionality reduction
 vikram360	oh.. PCA?
 blackburn	LLE, Isomap, etc
 vikram360	yes, I'm looking at your page right now :)
 vikram360	This may sound inappropriate, but would you mind if I looked at your project proposal?
 blackburn	I probably lost it already
 vikram360	oh.. that's ok
 vikram360	I'm sorry if I'm irritating you, but one last question: How do you suggest I start?
 blackburn	try to install shogun/ check its sources/ try it on some problem/ try to implement something/ check gsoc ideas/ choose one :)
 vikram360	ok.. thanks a lot man :)
 vikram360	what's the minimum age to vote in russia?
 blackburn	18
 vikram360	so did you vote?
 blackburn	yeah
 vikram360	who for?
 blackburn	prokhorov
 vikram360	isn't he the billionaire?
 blackburn	yes he is
 vikram360	http://www.boreme.com/posting.php?id=21220 : somehow putin's motorcade doesn't seem as big as the chechnyan leaders'
 vikram360	I wonder why
 vikram360	shit, kadyrov is a madman! http://jalopnik.com/5704390/the-chechen-presidents-guns-supercars-and-3000000-motorcade
 blackburn	well because putin doesn't want to be like kadyrov :)
 vikram360	but I think kadyrov is slightly loose in the head. His motorcade is worth 3 Million Dollars!
 blackburn	agree, he is a thief
 vikram360	is the GRU controlled by the government or are they fully independent or partially independent?
 blackburn	GRU, special ops guys?
 vikram360	isn't it your foreign intelligence agency?
 blackburn	yeah got it
 blackburn	yes, they are controlled by gov't
 vikram360	our intelligence agency is called RAW. As per the latest reports, intelligence officers were being used by politicians to spy on their election competition. And the director of the agency said that as a result of which, the intelligence agency was highly understaffed
 blackburn	hah crazy
 vikram360	welcome to india.
 vikram360	and now they've begun installing listening devices and packet sniffers. They've even asked google india and yahoo india to route their mail through indian servers
 vikram360	seriously messed up.
 vikram360	anyways, I've got to go sleep now. It's about 1 am and tomorrow is a school day. Are you on IRC everyday?
 blackburn	not every, but often
 vikram360	ok.. So I'll see you sometime :) Thanks a ton for all the advice, it was awesome talking to you :)

 n4nd0	blackburn: I have been taking a closer look to QDA
 blackburn	n4nd0: aha, and what do you think?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it looks good, not that much different to LDA
 blackburn	sure
 n4nd0	so I plan to study the code for LDA in shogun
 shogun-buildbot	build #168 of nightly_none is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/168
 n4nd0	try out the examples with it
 n4nd0	and hopefully start new coding for QDA :)
 blackburn	failure? hmm
 n4nd0	doesn't that normally happen?
 n4nd0	the first time soeren merged my Mahalanobis stuff it did
 n4nd0	but a couple of minutes later the build completed message appeared
 n4nd0	and I think I have seen that again another time with something Soeren did
 n4nd0	I think I should start using S?ren instead of Soeren providing that I use a keyboard with that letter :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: not really, I'll fix it now
 blackburn	if you are talking about shogun-buildbot msg - yes, it compiles after each commit
 n4nd0	aha
 n4nd0	just let me know if you want some help debugging sth ;)
 blackburn	oh I do some complex things right now and you probably find it pretty hard
 blackburn	would find*
 n4nd0	ok, I understand
 blackburn	recently I've added multiclass liblinear and now doing multiclass ocas
 blackburn	I just write wrappers for these libs
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I have followed your commits but not going into the code ...
 n4nd0	what I should do probably
 n4nd0	:(
 n4nd0	I'll be back later
 blackburn	nope, I don't think you should check every commit :)

 n4nd0	blackburn: hey, you there?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	can you check a moment line 77:LDA.cpp
 n4nd0	I think it should be || instead of &&, not sure though
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw one idea
 blackburn	classifiers should not check labels for such things
 blackburn	if you want you may exclude checks from each classifier
 blackburn	and add some methods to labels
 n4nd0	ok, I see
 blackburn	hm no, it is unclear
 blackburn	lets think about it a little more
 n4nd0	you mean like to substitute checks from labels from each of the classifiers
 blackburn	just some labels->check();
 blackburn	it is a little crappy now
 n4nd0	I see your point
 n4nd0	the idea of the method is good yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you like any gsoc idea?
 blackburn	more than others* :)
 n4nd0	haha yeah
 blackburn	which one?
 n4nd0	what I told you more or less, I like both the one of doc+examples and SO
 n4nd0	what do you think about those?
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	well both are interesting :)
 blackburn	and a lot of work probably
 blackburn	but I hope we will get accepted and it would be funny and smooth
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	I am first waiting for that, to the 16th so we get the results from google
 n4nd0	after that I will decide which one can I fit best to apply for
 blackburn	are you waiting for my birthday?
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	haha yeah, for that too ;)
 blackburn	funyy coincidence
 blackburn	nn*
 n4nd0	indeed
 n4nd0	hope it will bring us luck :)
 blackburn	let google make a present for me on my bday :D
 blackburn	damn 64.86 putin
 n4nd0	I have an exam the previous day ... don't know if that counts as coincidence :P
 n4nd0	the elections are not giving you a good present definetely...
 blackburn	can you imagine 64.86% with no actual support? :)
 blackburn	crazy
 n4nd0	sounds fishy yes
 n4nd0	when do you normally get final results btw?
 n4nd0	in Spain it is normally by this time when it is elections
 blackburn	day more
 n4nd0	but Russia is really big man!
 blackburn	60% papers counted
 blackburn	well pretty fast as well
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	you work fast then
 blackburn	big but not very populated
 blackburn	how many people there are in spain?
 n4nd0	about 50 millions I think
 blackburn	huh!
 blackburn	we have 142
 n4nd0	a little bit less according to wikipedia, 46
 blackburn	pretty uncorrelated with area
 n4nd0	definetely
 n4nd0	Russia is pretty big
 blackburn	we have 8 timezones so when we start to elect
 blackburn	vladivostok is about to finish
 n4nd0	8 timezones! that's a lot
 n4nd0	haha curious fact
 n4nd0	being that big, does it change the language a lot between regions?
 blackburn	no, only in some regions
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	tatarstan have two langs
 n4nd0	there are several different Spanish accents
 blackburn	russian and tatar
 blackburn	ah, about accents, it doesn't vary a lot
 n4nd0	we always joke with that :)
 n4nd0	yeah sorry, I meant more accents in Russian
 blackburn	for example guys from volgograd and moscow those you know
 blackburn	they probably say some words in a different way
 blackburn	e.g. what? - ???? - shto (volga), chto (moscow)
 blackburn	something like that
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	and some local words for sure
 n4nd0	some people in my Swedish course were speaking Russian so I tried to get some differences
 n4nd0	but no chance ...
 blackburn	haha yeah pretty hard to hear anything
 n4nd0	it was this point when you don't know anything about a language and you don't even notice where do the words start and end :)
 blackburn	I would not get any difference from spain accents :)
 n4nd0	well who knows
 n4nd0	we use to say that people that speak "difficult" languages as mother tongue are pretty good learning new ones
 n4nd0	and I guess Russian would be for use one of those difficult languages
 blackburn	it looks like russians can hardly learn languages :)
 blackburn	but may be it is an educational issue
 blackburn	I found latin language *very* useful in comprehension of european languages
 n4nd0	have you studied some latin?
 blackburn	yeah tried to
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	it was pretty interesting for me hah
