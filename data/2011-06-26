@sonney2k	f-x, alesis-novik don't forget your weekly report...
 f-x	sonney2k: sending it shortly
 f-x	been having internet problems again :(
@sonney2k	f-x, ok thanks
@sonney2k	hi blackburn or should I say 6lack6urn?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hi :D
 blackburn	as you wish, I understand 6oth :D
 bettyboo	cool :)
 blackburn	in fact I can type it using f7 - I remapped it
 blackburn	but it is slower
@sonney2k	horrible...
@sonney2k	heiko's computer is still dead...
@sonney2k	bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: looks like he can work without it :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: just curiosity - have you read the whole Molecular biology of the cell?
 blackburn	for me >1600 pages to go :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, nope
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay where did you learn about this bio-things ? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am trying to forget all those things :)
 bettyboo	:^)
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	blackburn, to have more room in my brain for ML
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	and childrens songs of course
 blackburn	sonney2k: well so tell me why so much pairs of human genome are non-coding?
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	blackburn, they are not non-coding
@sonney2k	they just don't code *directly* for proteins
@sonney2k	they code other stuff
 blackburn	which?
@sonney2k	like rna
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: about arpack
 blackburn	should that' tester' use arpack.h at libshogun/lib?
 blackburn	or better some code that just checks if he is able to get that function from arpack lib?

@sonney2k	blackburn, just some mimimal snippet int main(...) { //do sth with arpack }
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean I have to do some extern "C" things - etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: should I do it in header and just include it or do it right in that snippet?
@sonney2k	a standalone snippet please
 blackburn	aha! I see
 blackburn	will do soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you help me to add it into makefile?
@sonney2k	blackburn, as I said yes - just give me the snippet

@sonney2k	blackburn, done
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r59ffa87 / src/configure : add arpack configure detection - http://bit.ly/lEjQl6
 blackburn	sonney2k: awesome, thanks!
@sonney2k	use HAVE_ARPACK to do the magic
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to write nice wrapper to it - there are two billions variables :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, don't make it too nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: good thing about arpack addition - various MDS algos re-use ClassicMDS code
 blackburn	sonney2k: should it use SGMatrix, what do you think?

@sonney2k	blackburn, just enough that it works for you :)
 blackburn	these arpack guys presented me a puzzle: where the fuck matrix is passed to routine :D
 blackburn	seems ARPACK will guess matrix :D
 blackburn	oh it's going to be a prettiest wrapper :P
