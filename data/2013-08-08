 sonne|work	gsomix: yes exactly like this
 gsomix	sonney2k, \o/
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: so you are now officially from a terrorist country?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: what's it?
 lisitsyn	I am not following your media ;)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/07/obama-putin-talks-canceled-snowden
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: ahh snowden case
 sonne|work	cold war II is coming
 lisitsyn	no, that's not true
 sonne|work	or in other words winter is coming
@iglesiasg	brace yourselves
 lisitsyn	just games, in the long run US is a pure friend because all the stolen russian money is there
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: as for snowden I do not really understand what made the people so surprised
 thoralf	Hellau
@iglesiasg	hello hello
 lisitsyn	"Your mother's so fat, she's everyone's nearest neighbor."
 thoralf	lisitsyn: lolo
@iglesiasg	haha
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: large mother nearest neighbor
@iglesiasg	LMNN indeed
 thoralf	lisitsyn: You're an agent provocateur to make us saying bad things about the us? ;)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: the method is to drop the first nearest neighbor (the mother) that adds bias
 lisitsyn	thoralf: haha are you disallowed to do that?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: No, we're free to do that.
 lisitsyn	I am not actually I like the most of the things the US do
 thoralf	lisitsyn: But since it's in the channel logs, maybe my next travel so sf will be rejected? ;)
 thoralf	Free to do anything.  (With all consequences ;))
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I hope to get visa soon too!
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Then say something bad about Putin&Snowden&Co.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Now.
 thoralf	:D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I am totally apathetic to snowden actually
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Or better: Refuse to say something political.  You're just a normal guy that wants to work and carry its money to the US. :)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Very good. :)
 lisitsyn	but the putin is fucker we are desperate to get rid of him
 lisitsyn	I don't know anyone with IQ > 70 that supports him
 lisitsyn	we have to live with it though
 lisitsyn	thoralf: no I just want to visit mentor summit ;)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I guess you passed the via us entrance test
 thoralf	lisitsyn: I think Putin is very clever (and reckless) and a good networker within the "old" russian executive. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: no he is totally mad nowadyas
 lisitsyn	he was like clever and good in 2004
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: well I participated in rallys in 2011 ;) so that's what I think
 thoralf	lisitsyn: But how can you explain that he's still your leader?  Seems that he's not legitimated by the people, so there is another reason.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: there is a team that supports him
 sonne|work	thoralf: well why do we have merkel?
 thoralf	sonne|work: Don't remind me on that.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: russian people is mostly stupid - they would prefer to keep things
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: that holds for all people
 lisitsyn	I'd say he is supported by 30-40% now
 lisitsyn	that's the exact rate of idiots
 thoralf	lol
 lisitsyn	thoralf: is merkel that bad?
 lisitsyn	I have no clue
 lisitsyn	but you have a chance to get rid of she, right?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Yes
 lisitsyn	our guy is eternal
 thoralf	lisitsyn: No
 thoralf	:)

 thoralf	lisitsyn: 4-years * #successful-elections ;)
 lisitsyn	but do you think elections are cheated?
 lisitsyn	or she is just supported by the majority

 thoralf	No cheating, I guess.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: here they are ;)
 lisitsyn	it was heaaavily cheated

@wiking	lisitsyn: ah ok i've got this with my compiler as well... heh i think i've fucked up the things with -framework Accelerate
 sonne|work	van51: and that gives you the error?
 van51	sonne|work: it's not an infinite loop but yeah

 thoralf	sonne|work: If you've got 2 minutes, I've got a design question: Why do you always check dimensions when doing dot products etc.?  When (for example) multiplying two vectors, one could assume that it's infinite and filled with zeros.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Makes things lot more complicated when streaming stuff.
 thoralf	sonne|work: I usually don't know how many dimensions the final data will have after transformation, so it would be nice if it could be a bit more tolerant.
 sonne|work	thoralf: reason is just to avoid errors - we had a couple of kaboom situations where this did help
 sonne|work	thoralf: but sure for streamign I get your point
 thoralf	sonne|work: Do you see a way to relax this?
 sonne|work	thoralf: well you could do yourself - just give it vectors with adjusted size
 sonne|work	min(dim1,dim2)
 thoralf	sonne|work: I mean, assuming infinite vectors that are implicit filled with zeros is no big deal (except that .set_const() won't be clearly defined)
 thoralf	sonne|work: This would be the same (semantically), yes.  Just truncating inputs until they fit. ;)
 sonne|work	thoralf: yeah but it misses the error case - and it would be easy to adjust the size of your vector
 thoralf	sonne|work: But it's not clear how to "truncate" sparse vectors without copying then.
 sonne|work	thoralf: I mean x=y; x.vlen=17;
 sonne|work	thoralf: ahh sparse
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@109.169.229.38] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 thoralf	sonne|work: Actually it doesn't matter if sparse or dense: The problem that training-inputs have lower dimensions than evaluating-inputs makes things complicated.  Either: more checks/expensive resizing/reading data twice
 van51	sonne|work: I hope I removed it correctly. I removed what you said plus some compiler flags mentioning c++11 and it is still happening
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@109.169.184.246] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	sonne|work: But i acknowledge that I might not overlook all the implications of changing this behavious.
 thoralf	r
 sonne|work	thoralf: well for dense one has to do d=min(d1,d2) and then call dot with appropriate size
 sonne|work	thoralf: for sparse dims are IIRC not checked
 sonne|work	thoralf: indeed not checked
 sonne|work	thoralf: which function do you mean
 sonne|work	van51: alright then we have a nice race condition I cannot currently make sense of - but you did call init_shogun_with_defaults() once right?
 thoralf	sonne|work: for example CLinearMachine::apply_get_outputs
 thoralf	ASSERT(w.vlen==features->get_dim_feature_space())
 van51	sonne|work: yeah
 van51	sonne|work: this is the entire example https://gist.github.com/van51/6182792
 thoralf	sonne|work: But seen this in other places, too, since I'm using sparse all the time.
 van51	sonne|work: I'll continue to look into it
 sonne|work	van51: please create a minimal unit test for that
 van51	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	thoralf: yeah but it is not in SGSparseVector sparse_dot at least
 sonne|work	gsomix: tests fixed?
 hushell	iglesiasg: hi, do you have time to check my PR?
@iglesiasg	hushell, let mesee
@iglesiasg	hushell, did you update it already?
 hushell	iglesiasg: yes, few hours ago, when you sleeping I guess
 gsomix	sonne|work, fixing.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Right, but actually it doesn't matter where to relax things.  Just make it work more robust, since the product can be computed naturally without this checks.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Any suggestions?
@iglesiasg	hushell, it is a shame I don't get mails when new commits are done. If you remember for the next time, just write a dummy comment when you make a new commit, something like, updated! :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, I will check anyway if I can modify my github settings to get notified more
 thoralf	sonne|work: Maybe just remove the redundant checks where it hurts sparse?
 sonne|work	thoralf:  it will be various places. if possible you should do it in a way that it still helps catching erros
 thoralf	sonne|work: DenseFeatures seem to duplicate these checks.
 sonne|work	thoralf: it makes sense for streaming to remove checks
 sonne|work	but not for full matrices IMHO
 sonne|work	maybe for sparse it does
 sonne|work	because you never know how much dims you will get when testing
 hushell	iglesiasg: really? seems github isn't that reliable
 thoralf	sonne|work: I'll check what I can do with minimal impact. ;)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: you sure you subscribed to getting these notifications?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, my notification status is watching
 sonne|work	thoralf: I guess you are right with sparse but you need to make the code then more tolerant as in when a sparse vector with dim > dim_dense arrives drop indices
 sonne|work	hmmh no clue
 hushell	The time tag for the new commit is always wrong
 hushell	only records the first commit
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I actually get mails if anyone comments something in a pull request I have commented. But for some reason I don't get any mail if only a new commits happens or someone amends a commit
@iglesiasg	hushell, might that be because of the timezone?
 hushell	iglesiasg: I don't think so, your comments are right
 hushell	I meant the time
@iglesiasg	aham
@iglesiasg	hushell, I think it is looking ready! There is just this question about reference counting of m_fg.

@iglesiasg	I just read about kmeans++, do we have that already in Shogun? Otherwise, I will write an issue. It looks like a nice entrance task.
@iglesiasg	It seems we don't have it
 thoralf	sonne|work: It basically affects CSparseFeatures.  If you want to keep your checks, what about having a class "RelaxedSparseFeatures", which with as less dimension-assumptions as possible and SparseFeatures, which just overloads and adds assertions?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: what is kmeans++?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, an extension of kmeans to initialize in a smart way the cluster centers
 sonne|work	thoralf: it will also make dense_dot in sparse expensive since you have to check for each dim
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: so 'just' different cluster center init?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, pretty straightforward to understand: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B#Initialization_algorithm

@iglesiasg	sonne|work, yeah, although 'only this' seems to improve kmeans quite a bit

-!- gsomix [~gsomix@109.169.243.250] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	thoralf: well no when you take a sparse vector you have to check for each dim if it is < valid dim

 gsomix	sonne|work, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1377

@wiking	?
@iglesiasg	wiking, the old eigen issue

@iglesiasg	wiking, it has been like that for some days now. That test never finishes in old eigen
@wiking	okok
@iglesiasg	wiking, the one in ubuntu repositories
@wiking	soon soon
@iglesiasg	wiking, me touching travis.yaml the other day was an attempt to fix that ;)
@wiking	just trying to find out wtf is with ruby modular
@wiking	it crashes on my machine.... let's hope that it's some osx bs
@wiking	since the other day it was still working...
@iglesiasg	let's see
@wiking	otherwise i'll move the ruby job to allowed to fail ;)
@wiking	iglesiasg: i've put 3.1.2 for eigen
@wiking	as a minimum requirement in cmake
@wiking	that should do it, right?
@iglesiasg	yes, I think so
@iglesiasg	let me double check with the version I installed
@iglesiasg	it was 3.1.4 IIRC
@wiking	ok otherwise if one wants to have bundled eigen then it'll download 3.1.4
@wiking	yeah but requiring 3.1.4 is quite unrealistic
@wiking	as it's really couple of days old
@iglesiasg	I think Heiko said 3.1 should be fine
@iglesiasg	I think ubuntu ships some 3.0. something
@wiking	next ubuntu version (12.10 or 13.x) has 3.1.2
@wiking	it's just that travis has 12.04
@wiking	and that has 3.0

@wiking	mmm it fails sometimes
@HeikoS	decrease accuracy in this case
@HeikoS	just by 20% or so

@HeikoS	sonne|work: doodle tell you the timezone
@HeikoS	it shows me mine
@HeikoS	sonne|work: but the one in the evening today is 22 german time
@iglesiasg	wiking, that looks fancy!
@HeikoS	sonne|work: the bank account thing keeps on being annyoing
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, it actually shows here just 9:00 PM so it is good that you mentioned it!
@HeikoS	sonne|work: it *is* set up now, but it was a few days too late and now my parents are in vaccation, so noone can tell me the number
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I called them but they refuse to give it over phone
 sonne|work	HeikoS: it didn't set me the the time zone
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: whatever doodle days
 sonne|work	HeikoS: when are they back?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: weeks
@HeikoS	few
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so there are a few options now:
 sonne|work	HeikoS: as in still agust?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: yes end of august
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, yep but the thing is 9:00 your timezone or ours? :P It
@HeikoS	1.) do it over my girl's account (no income in gemrnay)
 sonne|work	then it should be fine
@HeikoS	2.) ask my grandparent to find the mail (unlikely)
 sonne|work	HeikoS: in any case we have to do the whole supplier enrolment again
 sonne|work	I guess we can still wait.
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I know but I need a bank account
 sonne|work	HeikoS: do you already have your account number and everything?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: no thats the problem
@HeikoS	sonne|work: they wont tell me wihtout the pin which is in a letter at home
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so you don't even  know your 'kontonummer' ?
@HeikoS	no
 sonne|work	we dont' need the pin now
@HeikoS	I know
@HeikoS	but they dont give it
@HeikoS	via phone
@wiking	do u need an offshore acc?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	brb
 sonne|work	HeikoS: then I guess we better wait
@HeikoS	when is the PO deadline?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: now I still don't know which timezone doodle is in
@HeikoS	sonne|work: doodle shows the local time
 sonne|work	but I am not available this evening anyways
@HeikoS	ah ok
 sonne|work	so better just do it with the others in the evening and then we could have a chat tomorrow in the morning
@HeikoS	so fill in the doodle
@HeikoS	we can also wait till next week its not urgent
@HeikoS	oh btw I am away next weel
@HeikoS	k
@HeikoS	I think everyone should be there

@HeikoS	really?
 sonne|work	utc+2
@HeikoS	wow then doodle does not show local
@HeikoS	sorry for this
@HeikoS	so doodle is utc +1

 sonne|work	but maybe you have a quick meeting with the others and you all do your votes
@HeikoS	so thats fine
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	so i guess no:)
@HeikoS	We will have a meeting this evening then without you sonne|work then we can discuss

 thoralf	sonne|work: thoralf: not worth the hassle <-- Talking about what?
 thoralf	HeikoS: It's only random because some places are dealing with duplicated features, others don't.
@HeikoS	thoralf: yes
@HeikoS	but no idea about the order etc
@HeikoS	also saving etc
@HeikoS	you can probably store multiple ones, but no defined behaviour afterwards
 thoralf	HeikoS: Before doing anyhing - what is the desired behaviour?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Even duplicated features are okay - but only if it's consistent. :)
@wiking	sonne|work: i dont know how to generate that init_shogun.m
 sonne|work	wiking: just all modules
 thoralf	HeikoS, sonne|work: I'll send a PR which makes duplicated features consistent, okay?
@HeikoS	thoralf: sounds good!
@wiking	sonne|work: ?
@HeikoS	thoralf: why do you need that even?
 sonne|work	thoralf: optimize the f-score!
 thoralf	HeikoS: First of all: When hashing features, you get duplicates.
 sonne|work	thoralf: it is not helping / so joachims paper from icml long time ago
 thoralf	sonne|work: Do you mean SVMperf?
 sonne|work	thoralf: don't remember sth that can optimzie F1/ auROC etc
 thoralf	sonne|work: I guess it's ICML 2005, svm perf.
 thoralf	sonne|work: But there is nothing comparable implemented in shogun, right?
@wiking	thoralf: u use octave?
 thoralf	Having 3M input vectors and only 2k positives.  That's bad thing for accuracy. ;)
 thoralf	wiking: Actually not, but I could.  Why?
@wiking	i need the content of init_shogun.m
 thoralf	wiking: Lol.  Second.
 thoralf	nitialize shogun by loading all of its modules
 thoralf	modshogun;
 thoralf	Thats it.
@wiking	mmm interesting
@wiking	thnx
@wiking	then creating
 gsomix	sonne|work, hey
 thoralf	wiking: Have a look at ./src/interfaces/octave_static/Makefile:
 sonne|work	thoralf: no but it is not helping performance anyway so not worth the time
 sonne|work	wiking: so drop it please
 sonne|work	wiking: before we had like 10 modules Kernel, Distance etc etc
 sonne|work	since we now only have one it doesn't make sense any longer
@wiking	sonne|work: you mean to drop the init_shogun.m ?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
@wiking	sonne|work:  imean the problem is then that the octave examples need to be changed

 gsomix	sonne|work, PR is updated, there is work for Travis.
@wiking	sonne|work: ping
 sonne|work	wiking: ?
@wiking	sonne|work: so the thing is now that currently when one does make in the src with cmake then everything is going to be compiled
@wiking	meaning unit tests, examples everything
@wiking	if of course example building or testing is enabled
 sonne|work	wiking: could you make parts optional?
@wiking	hence if one builds a python modular interface and testing is enabled
@wiking	then unit-test + libshogun examples will be built
@wiking	and this is a lot of time
@wiking	see the python modular interface currently is running for 26 min 58 sec
@wiking	on travis
@wiking	and still not ready
@wiking	yeah i mean i can remove parts from make all target
 sonne|work	yeah I would prefer that this is only done when requested
@wiking	well the request is
 sonne|work	I mean unit tests examples etc
@wiking	ENABLE_TESTING
@wiking	or ENABLED_EXAMPLES
@wiking	this you have to give to cmake
@wiking	so they are by default OFF
@wiking	but of course this is on on travis
@wiking	i was thinking about making some hack variables
@wiking	that would disable parts of this
 sonne|work	why?
 sonne|work	sounds good then
@wiking	so we could have
@wiking	ENABLE_TESTING + DISABLE_UNIT_TESTS
@wiking	so that when i'm doing on travis something
@wiking	then we dont rerun unit tests
@wiking	like always
@wiking	same with the libshogun examples
@wiking	as currently it is compiled always
@wiking	and run ...
@wiking	as with ./configure ...
@wiking	which is of course by default is a good thing
@wiking	but on travis not...
@wiking	ok i'll add these hack variables
@wiking	maybe i'll add it like
@wiking	TRAVIS_DISABLED_UNIT_TESTS
@wiking	so that we know that it's really only meant to be used on travis...
 sonne|work	wiking: maybe you can use the logic that you don't run libshogun examples/unit tests if other interfaces are configured?
 sonne|work	or at least optionally off
@wiking	sonne|work: why ? i mean they should be by default
@wiking	*on by default
@wiking	if you want examples/tests and building a new shogun
@wiking	you should build all the related examples/tests
@wiking	libshogun + modular stuff you've chosen
@wiking	a user would need this
@wiking	but not travis...
 sonne|work	yes ok so optionall off
 sonne|work	y

@wiking	anybody here who has a working octave_modular env?
@iglesiasg	wiking, back some days ago I tried to build octave modular with CMake and it didn't work out
@iglesiasg	maybe you remember about it
@wiking	but do you have a non cmake octave_modular that is working ? :)
@iglesiasg	nope
@wiking	since i have the modshogun.so for octave
@wiking	but the examples are dying by not finding it
@iglesiasg	I can try to build it now if you want
@wiking	although i set OCTAVE_PATH
@wiking	so i dont know anymore wtf is happening
@wiking	how can i get the examples working

@iglesiasg	hello guys
@wiking	yo
@wiking	just a sec
@iglesiasg	sorry for the delay
@iglesiasg	did I miss something?
@wiking	i need a coffee+cigarette
@wiking	but u can start discussing
@wiking	about the AWESOMENESS OF CMAKE!
@wiking	:DDD
@iglesiasg	haha
@HeikoS	so all there?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg, wiking, lisitsyn
@wiking	and if somebody could fix the integration test that'd be great
@iglesiasg	sonney2k won't be here with us finally?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: no he cannot be here
@HeikoS	So first of all a few words about these meetings:
 lisitsyn	I am here
@HeikoS	s?ren and I had the idea it would be nice to have regular discussion like the one a while ago
@HeikoS	and document the outcomes
@HeikoS	becasue during the day there are always so many other things
@HeikoS	so I suggest we take turns in organising them every month or so
@HeikoS	So I got the following points for today
@HeikoS	1.) Talk a bit about how we organise the meetings (documentation etc)
@HeikoS	2.) Talk about docsprint application
@HeikoS	3.) Talk about wiking's amazing cmake job
@HeikoS	any other points you want to talk about?
 lisitsyn	I have nothing else
@wiking	+1 foundation
@HeikoS	wiking: ok good idea, lets do that as 4.)
@HeikoS	so 1.)
@iglesiasg	(I am fine with those too)
@HeikoS	I will write a short summary of the things decided today and put them in the github wiki
@HeikoS	so that we have a growing list of ideas
@HeikoS	who will do the next one?
@wiking	\o.
@HeikoS	wiking: you?
@wiking	y
@HeikoS	nice :)
@HeikoS	so then docsprint
@HeikoS	I drafted this little application, deadline is tomorrow
@HeikoS	Last year we did not get in, I think one reason might have been that our proposal was too mathy
@HeikoS	too much ML
@HeikoS	This year, this is only one of a few points
@HeikoS	So please edit the things and write comments
@HeikoS	make your own description more fancy, shorten my scentences (I tend to write too much)
@HeikoS	so that we have a nice proposal. I will submit this tomorrow noon
@HeikoS	Any comments on the thing already?
 lisitsyn	no
@iglesiasg	nice work, I didn't get time yet to read it completely though
@iglesiasg	will do after the meeting
@wiking	i haven't managed to read it yet sorry :(
@HeikoS	please read carefully and tune it
@iglesiasg	just glanced over it
@HeikoS	alwasys better maybe you have some more ideas
@HeikoS	also have a look at last years docsprint
@HeikoS	there are many blog entries about it and one can also read the book e.g. by KDE
-!- zxtx [~zv@rrcs-76-79-81-162.west.biz.rr.com] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	I suggested 4 points to document
@HeikoS	installation - framework overview - a handful of ML algos - hacking shogun(dev guidelines)
@HeikoS	KDE last year have like a little webpage with the book
@HeikoS	I think for part 1,2,4, we should have a simmilar thing, maybe orient on scikit learn's page
@HeikoS	for 3 we should write ipython notebook and then include the rendered version in the book
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn, iglesiasg so please add your stuff and make the proposal awesome, you will get a free trip to US if this works and we can spend three nice days on this
@iglesiasg	sure!
@HeikoS	http://en.flossmanuals.net/kde-guide/
 lisitsyn	okay I'll take a look for sure
@HeikoS	also look at this one
@HeikoS	ok then, wiking tell us about cmake :)
@wiking	heheh
@wiking	ok so it's merged
@wiking	i've completely refactored travis
@wiking	and as u can see now we have still 2 jobs failing
@wiking	a) python integration with fisher shit
@wiking	b) one octave example
@wiking	octave modular wasn't in previously in travis so maybe
@wiking	until it doesn't get fixed we should move it to allowed to fail jobs
@wiking	since as u can see we have now jobs that are allowed to fail
@wiking	like the new OSX build
@wiking	;)
@HeikoS	nice
@wiking	anyhow i wrote a short tutorial on the mailing list how to use cmake for building
@wiking	but
@HeikoS	wiking: could you maybe add a little README on how things work?`or extend the existing one
@wiking	we need still some lines about this in the README/INSTALL files
@wiking	can somebody please do this?
@wiking	based on that little tutorial
@wiking	i'm like fuckk off all with this cmake now
@HeikoS	wiking: just running cmake for the first time :)
@wiking	anyhow
@HeikoS	wiking: haha :)
@wiking	there are several things we need to discuss
@HeikoS	wiking: why do I have to create a dir for it?
@HeikoS	ha! it works! :)
@wiking	1) changing buildbots to use cmake. where we not only want to compile but with the nightly bots
@wiking	we want to create packages with cpack and upload them somewhere
@wiking	these packages would be: tar.gz, tar.bz2, .deb and .rpm
@HeikoS	wiking: does it create the deb etc already?
@wiking	the first to is pretty easy to create
@wiking	make package
@wiking	the .deb and .rpm creating still needs hacking
@wiking	so basically the CMakeLists.txt still needs some love to do those properly
@wiking	but i could already create libshogun.deb and libshogun-dev.deb
@wiking	which is something
@HeikoS	wiking: cool yes
@HeikoS	wiking: its fast
@wiking	we need to set up a repository for this
@HeikoS	wiking: how can I do --enable-debug and disable optimization
@HeikoS	also do I need to specify gtest?
@wiking	HeikoS: -DDISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS=ON
@wiking	to cmake
@wiking	debug is by default afaik... but let me know if not :)
@wiking	no
@wiking	if you do -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: have a look to ccmake too
@wiking	then it'll automagically download the right version of gmock/gtest
@wiking	so you don't have to care about that at all
@HeikoS	wiking: how to enable debug=
@HeikoS	?
@wiking	HeikoS: debug is by default
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, so how can I print a list of all options like for configure?
@wiking	HeikoS: cmake by default supports 2 build types: Debug and Release
@wiking	HeikoS: ccmake ..
@wiking	or cmake gui
 lisitsyn	cmake -i
@wiking	that'll show all the options u want/need
 lisitsyn	works too
@wiking	ah yeah
@wiking	if ccache is found
@HeikoS	wiking: I have a problem:
@wiking	it's automatically enabled
@wiking	HeikoS: tell me
@HeikoS	cmake -DPythonModular=ON  -DDISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS=ON ..
@HeikoS	CMake Error: Attempt to add a custom rule to output "/home/heiko/Desktop/shogun/shogun/build/src/interfaces/python_modular/Converter_includes.i.rule" which already has a custom rule.
@HeikoS	and many more
@wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	-- Could NOT find Eigen3: Found unsuitable version "3.0.93", but required is at least "3.1.2" (found /usr/include/eigen3)
@wiking	HeikoS: that shit is because of the remaining files of ./configure
@HeikoS	doesnt it download eigen? How can I add that?
@HeikoS	ah I see so make clean
@wiking	what's the command to reset the repo and remove all the files that are not part of the repo?
@wiking	or yeah
@wiking	in src do a make clean
@HeikoS	wiking: worked
@HeikoS	and the eigen thing?
@wiking	HeikoS: as written in the email
@wiking	HeikoS: if u dont have the proper eigen version
@wiking	then just -DBUNDLE_EIGNE=ON
@wiking	then just -DBUNDLE_EIGEN=ON
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	wiking: cant this be done autonmatically?
@wiking	HeikoS: what?
@wiking	HeikoS: you mean if there's no right version of eigen?
@HeikoS	wiking: like if eigen3 is not there this is added automagic?
 lisitsyn	git clean -dfx
 lisitsyn	is the command
@wiking	well i dont know... maybe somebody wants shogun w/o eigen
@HeikoS	wiking: mmmh default should be with
@HeikoS	and then turn off if desired
@wiking	HeikoS: that can be done
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	but currently we have a problem
@wiking	with cmake
@HeikoS	ah cool its compiles eigen :)
@HeikoS	error
@wiking	say you add a new class
 lisitsyn	it won't be visible
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	src/classifier/NewMotherfuckerClassifier.cpp
 lisitsyn	because of cmake stupidity
@wiking	yes
@wiking	imho there's a way around this
@wiking	using some hacks
@wiking	but i hadn't had the time to fix this
@iglesiasg	what?
@wiking	so if u add a new file
@iglesiasg	what is the way to do then?
@iglesiasg	make clean?
@wiking	u have to re-run cmake
@iglesiasg	all righ
@iglesiasg	right*
@HeikoS	wiking: thats not too bad
@wiking	yeah maybe
@wiking	i'm suspicious about the versionheader.h
@wiking	as well
@wiking	because it might trigger the rebuild of the whole shit... but i dont know
@wiking	have to test it
@wiking	let me know if you are having too much rebuilds :P
@wiking	and i'll try to fix it asap
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@wiking	anyhow it's there and it's more or less working
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome job you did there :)
@wiking	static interfaces are completely missing
@wiking	if anybody has the feeling for doing it go ahead
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe put a TODO list in a github issue so that we know whats missing etc
@wiking	that should be really the easier part afaik
@wiking	will do
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@HeikoS	any more on cmake then?
@wiking	mmm yeah
@wiking	it's not that much related
@wiking	but
@wiking	lets fucking fix this error in integration
@wiking	NOW
@wiking	not tomorrow
@wiking	now
@HeikoS	volunteers? :)
@wiking	so that we can have finally green buttons on PR
@iglesiasg	wiking: this one? https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10000361
@wiking	i can put the octave modular interface into allowed to fail
@wiking	and then it should be good
@HeikoS	wiking: how to best access this remote report thing? the travis ui is always so slow
@wiking	HeikoS: well i've created this:
@HeikoS	careful
@HeikoS	results actually changed in the test
@wiking	http://maeth.com/cdash/index.php?project=Shogun
@HeikoS	7.4 vs 8.25
@HeikoS	so just bookmark the site?
@wiking	no
@wiking	i still have to work on this
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	to travis for now
@wiking	to get all the configure shit and stuff there
@wiking	but as soon as it's ready
@HeikoS	since when is the integration test failing?
@wiking	i'll send a message about this
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would you mind fixing the test?
@wiking	iglesiasg: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10000361#L3388
@wiking	yes this
@HeikoS	I have to fix another one  :)
@wiking	-[  9.92749338e-02   7.44443696e-01   8.76619850e-06]
@wiking	+[  9.92749338e-02   8.25347020e-01   8.76619850e-06]
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	I don't mind
 lisitsyn	what test?
@HeikoS	wiking: just pasted it
@HeikoS	library_fisher2x3_modular.py changed results
@wiking	lisitsyn: The following tests failed! library_fisher2x3_modular.py setting 1/1
@wiking	Detailled failures: library_fisher2x3_modular.py setting 1/1
@HeikoS	quite a bit
 lisitsyn	okay
@HeikoS	so why could that be?
 lisitsyn	no idea what it is
@HeikoS	mmh
@wiking	i'm just running now the same thing on a different ubuntu
@HeikoS	anyone HAS an idea? (I dont?)
@wiking	let's see what it does
 lisitsyn	that's something sonney2k added in september of 2011 IIRC
@HeikoS	wiking: so random generator maybe?
@HeikoS	so  he should fix it ....
@wiking	HeikoS: dunno... i dont think fisher has anything to do with prng
@HeikoS	but data maybe?
@HeikoS	since when does it fail?
@wiking	it's a numpy binary
@wiking	HeikoS: lemme check travis
@wiking	before the merge
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn on lets fix after meeting
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	HeikoS: btw travis is much more responsive with chrome
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	last point: foundation
@HeikoS	so we collected all the signatures on the current state of the Satzung
@wiking	btW: before the merge it was not failing!
@HeikoS	There were a few updates to it, so I will update this
@HeikoS	I am away next week, but once I am back, I can ask sonney2kto send me the copy of the things etc
@HeikoS	Then I will check the next steps
@wiking	lisitsyn: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/9996249#L2944
@HeikoS	We have to write a protocol about how the foundation was funded
@HeikoS	ah one thing
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn, iglesiasg do you got a good idea how to do an anyonymous vote online?
@wiking	HeikoS: how official does it have to be?
@HeikoS	Because we have to vote for a main guy for the foundation
@HeikoS	not official
@iglesiasg	we can all get into a chat
@iglesiasg	with guest_ names or so
@wiking	and it has to b anonymous?
@HeikoS	just that we can write in the protocol that there was an anonymous vote
@iglesiasg	xD
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	iglesiasg: good one ;)
@HeikoS	anonym
@HeikoS	but everyon just allowed to vote once
@wiking	yeah random irc channel
@HeikoS	no then we cannot controll the votes
@wiking	hehehe
@iglesiasg	IRC through webchat in that case
@HeikoS	and it would be good if we can do it over a few days
@HeikoS	no we have to invite people
@iglesiasg	well just a doodle then
@HeikoS	and then they are allowed to vote once
@HeikoS	doodle?
@iglesiasg	aaah wait only once
@wiking	HeikoS: it's open to everybody?
@iglesiasg	nothing
 lisitsyn	crazy
@HeikoS	wiking: no invite only
@wiking	HeikoS: ah ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its not legal otherwise
@wiking	HeikoS: then i think it's good
@HeikoS	unfortunately
 lisitsyn	yeah I understand HeikoS
@wiking	HeikoS: random irc channel guest
@wiking	and then n number of ppl
@wiking	and we cound the number of votes
@wiking	they should match
@HeikoS	wiking: but this channel needs to run for a dew days
@wiking	;)
@HeikoS	wiking: if we send the link to the people it doesnt matter how many vote
@HeikoS	thats good
@HeikoS	but it needs to be logged
@iglesiasg	http://www.anonvote.com/
@HeikoS	and its non anon
@HeikoS	IPs are visible
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you check that out and implement one for us. Just make a little test
@wiking	HeikoS: ^
@wiking	heheh
@HeikoS	ok once this is working, you all vote for or against me and then we can collect the protocol and all the paperwork and sonney2kcan bring it to the court in Berlin
@HeikoS	we have to pay some money
@HeikoS	then we can apply to be recognised as charity
@sonney2k	wiking, please put that description of cmake you did in the readme on how to compile shogun
@HeikoS	and then we have  a legal body that is allowed to take money without paying taxes
@HeikoS	thats it
@wiking	sonney2k: i've propagated the job to somebody else :)
@HeikoS	so next week
 lisitsyn	yeah me me
@sonney2k	wiking, lisitsyn  excellent
@HeikoS	ok anything else for the foundation then?
@wiking	sonney2k: buildbots?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah we need notar for the copy
@wiking	sonney2k: do u have time for that today?
@sonney2k	wiking, we can change libshogun based buildbots
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah, but first vote leader and update Satzung
@wiking	sonney2k: u can change modular as well...
@sonney2k	wiking, I am rather tired though
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you have my vote
@wiking	sonney2k: gimme access and i'll make it for u
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	sonney2k, lisitsyn, wiking, iglesiasg anything else for the meeting, comments?
@HeikoS	If not, wiking will do the next one, I suggest in one month
@HeikoS	I will put up a summary
@HeikoS	most important: please everyone read and tune the docsprint proposal!
@HeikoS	*meeting over
 lisitsyn	okay
@HeikoS	Will do some cooking now, be back in a little while
@sonney2k	wiking, then we only need static
@wiking	sonney2k: yeps
@wiking	lisitsyn: this fucking integration fails big time on another ubuntu :D
@wiking	just generating the log
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, HeikoS, wiking : tell me if you got the mail guys
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I did
@wiking	iglesiasg: gotit
@iglesiasg	I think that is pretty much what we need
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: got it :)
@iglesiasg	cool
@sonney2k	gsomix, are the tests finally fixed?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: so that does everything we need, right?
@iglesiasg	we can set a time interval, anonymous, and ensure each one votes once
@wiking	sonney2k: on the nightly we would need ipython 1.0
@wiking	sonney2k: can u git clone it?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep!
@iglesiasg	I need to grab dinner now, I am starving!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: is there anything else to discuss?
@sonney2k	gsomix, PR please
 gsomix	sonney2k, already merged
@wiking	what the hack is this:
@wiking	kernel_anova_modular.py
@wiking	-n
@wiking	+o
@wiking	why n and why o? )
@wiking	:)
 gsomix	sonney2k, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1377
@sonney2k	argh got disconnected
@sonney2k	wiking, did you already change travis?
@wiking	sonney2k: yes yes
@wiking	sonney2k: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, already merged, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1377
@wiking	the osx builder machine is quite slow :S
@sonney2k	wiking, sth is still weird - the library_fisher2x3_modular.py is not giving the same result
@wiking	sonney2k: i know...
@wiking	but i dont know why
@sonney2k	it uses floatmax_t, lgammal
@sonney2k	wiking, do we have a test for lgammal ?
@sonney2k	wiking, it has a ifdef HAVE_LGAMMAL
 gsomix	sonney2k, changes and new code will be tomorrow then. need sleep a little.
 gsomix	nite guys
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok cu tomorrow!
@wiking	sonney2k: -- Looking for lgammal
@wiking	-- Looking for lgammal - not found
@wiking	sonney2k: Checking for Math lgammal() support ... yes
@wiking	hehe
@wiking	ok checking the error why it doesn't find it

@sonney2k	wiking, ahh no need for that I will do that on the nightly buildbot so we can directly have it on the page
@wiking	k
@wiking	i'll setup the new target
@sonney2k	wiking, we need some way of listing the notebooks / and decision where we put it on the website
@sonney2k	wiking, ohh not a cmake target though
@wiking	you'll only have to give the path to the ipython dir where u cloned the latest ipython
@wiking	no?
@sonney2k	wiking, I wanted to run the ipynb_run_save.py heiko gave me
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@90.204.166.211] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah u need ipython 1.0 for that
@sonney2k	wiking, and I already 'fixed' the script to fail when there is an exception in the notebook
@sonney2k	currently it will never list failures
@wiking	:)
@sonney2k	wiking, biggest issue currently is imho where to put it on the website and to do it with some style
@sonney2k	wiking, like here http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/svm_binary_classification_run_saved.ipynb
@sonney2k	importerror but no failures
@HeikoS	re
@HeikoS	sonney2k: does running the notebooks and uploading work already?
@HeikoS	awesome!
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  what do you think on the idea to include some notebooks in the docsprint? for one of the parts?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I mean format wise we should use the notebooks - iglesiasg showed me some book fully done in notebook
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah I know
@sonney2k	wiking, any idea about the lgammal?
@HeikoS	ah cool
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: did you see it?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: there are some things however for that we need other listings than python
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: I can dig in for the link otherwise
@HeikoS	so I would only do the ML framework related stuff in there
@HeikoS	not the install shogun and the hacking shogun
@wiking	sonney2k:
@wiking	sonney2k: it's fixed with the last commit
@HeikoS	only framework/class overview and algo description
@wiking	sonney2k: and it actually fixed that error in the integration test
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: see what?
@wiking	sonney2k: but you've created 2 new errors
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: the complete book in ipython
@wiking	sonney2k: kernel_linear_byte_modular.py                                ERROR (name 'LoadMatrix' is not defined)
@wiking	sonney2k: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10004898#L3187
@wiking	sonney2k: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10004898#L3697
@sonney2k	wiking, how do I force cmake to do a full reconfigure
@wiking	rm -rf  *
@wiking	:)
@wiking	in the build
@sonney2k	no other way?
@wiking	well that's one way
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but a typo is dangerous
@sonney2k	so I would rather want to do that with some cmake option
