@sonney2k	nice figures!
@sonney2k	blackburn, due to my first blog post I had 966 hits
@sonney2k	on my homepage
@sonney2k	today
@sonney2k	so if we make a really good shogun page we will get thousands easily
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, what we should do is create a new shogun homepage ...
@sonney2k	with lots more figures / cool style
 blackburn	I'm sure we should but where to get time..
@sonney2k	I am really tempted to use the same django stuff I use currently for my homepage underneath
@sonney2k	yeah you are right
@sonney2k	but all we need is a new style
@sonney2k	blackburn, for example I am using this for my homepage http://www.nuviotemplates.com/template/crystlix-01/
@sonney2k	but they have more http://www.nuviotemplates.com/
@sonney2k	blackburn, then it is really only copy & paste for now and extend slowly later
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll try to make some logo if get any inspiration :)
@sonney2k	http://www.nuviotemplates.com/preview.php?template=gr8-01 :)
@sonney2k	I would really love to have one big central picture that changes all the time and shows some graphical illustrations
 blackburn	sonney2k: we lack beatiful graphics
@sonney2k	blackburn, we can easily generate some
 blackburn	not sure they would be really beatiful :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, anyway you better fix some more regressions :)
@sonney2k	heh true
 blackburn	sonney2k: so did you get pics?
@sonney2k	<blackburn> sonney2k: check your googlemail
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> nice figures!
 blackburn	ehh

 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please answer that sklearn guy?
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.nuviotemplates.com/preview.php?template=simply-01 I like the simplest one

 blackburn	sonney2k: "????????? ????? ????????? ???????? (LLE, HLLE, LTSA ? ??????);" -- new learning algorithms are added hah
 blackburn	we got strange description of shogun in russian
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you update the 'feature matrix' that everyone complains about at the ML :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it looks ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, have you read the mails on the ML about it?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	well we support a few things now
@sonney2k	like preprocessing / model selection ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would prefer to hunt some bugs now :) but if you don't want I could
@sonney2k	I prefer you bug hunting :)
 blackburn	deal
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have a blog? http://shogun-toolbox.org/planet/
@sonney2k	I should add you there ^
 blackburn	sonney2k: nope, only twitter but it is kinda uninformative heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: alesis did not really beatuful pics (me too btw), I'll try to make a 3d surface instead of level lines
 blackburn	no idea how to describe other students' work graphically :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, it looks nice imho
@sonney2k	but yes it is technical :)

 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: got it
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem is it is not going to be updated
