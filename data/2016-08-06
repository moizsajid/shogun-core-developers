 sanuj	wiking, yo
@wiking	hello
 sanuj	i'm trying to debug this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3250
@wiking	what seems to be the problem?
 sanuj	does this error mean anything to you
 sanuj	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/138594060#L2751
 sanuj	everything is passing except Ruby
 sanuj	i'm not able to locate the origin of error
 sanuj	i mean what the heck is 'initialize'
@wiking	the easiest is
@wiking	that you run this locally on your machine
@wiking	and then you can debug it nicely
 sanuj	wiking, this is the .rb file https://gist.github.com/sanuj/112a42c32062644f533325e6639af06a#file-multiple_kernel_learning_binary_classifier-rb-L19
@wiking	nono
@wiking	i know what is where
@wiking	but i would suggest you to debug it
@wiking	i'm not a ruby compiler
@wiking	you can run all this on your machine
 sanuj	okay, let me try
 sanuj	last time i tried, i was having trouble building ruby
 sanuj	i'll try again
@wiking	well you can always
@wiking	use the docker image
@wiking	that is used
@wiking	for travis
 sanuj	was getting this error last time https://gist.github.com/sanuj/cc98f73b040b34f8adbc1da12af71aa6
 sanuj	how to use the docker image
 sanuj	is there a readme guide?
 sanuj	let me install docker first :P
@wiking	sanuj, it's called RTFM )
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	wiking, kk
@wiking	sanuj, any luck?

 sanuj	lisitsyn, so register_param is non_owning every time

 sanuj	oh yeah
 sanuj	missed that
 lisitsyn	yes it is non-owning so that available getters/setters work on exactly the same value
 sanuj	lisitsyn, yes

 lisitsyn	ok rebased lets see
 lisitsyn	if it works
