@sonney2k	blackburn, the only other idea regarding reducing 'wrapper code size' is to remove Array
@sonney2k	I am afraid I don't know what else to remove...
 blackburn	will it help that much?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	but any templated class would
@sonney2k	I mean currently each tempalted class exists for ~8 data types
@sonney2k	-> 8 wrappers
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	grep template interfaces/modular/* | wc -l
@sonney2k	258
@sonney2k	grep template interfaces/modular/* | grep CArray | wc -l
@sonney2k	30
@sonney2k	better than nothing...
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can I handle CCache with steal_feature_matrix?
 blackburn	it corrupts stealed memory
 blackburn	when deleting
@sonney2k	Builds of shogun have failed on several architectures because
@sonney2k	SWIG's output proved too much for their compilers to handle; per
@sonney2k	https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=shogun&suite=sid
@sonney2k	the build blew out on ruby on s390 and on octave on i386, ia64,
@sonney2k	powerpc, and sparc.  Could you please take a look?
 blackburn	uh
@sonney2k	debian bug report
 shogun-buildbot	build #226 of octave_modular is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/226  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
@sonney2k	ahh we are finally getting octave_modular bugs - very good :)
 blackburn	I was wondering why it is not working:
 blackburn	return SGMatrix<ST>(feature_matrix, num_features, num_vectors);
 blackburn	feature_matrix = NULL;
 blackburn	feature_matrix_num_vectors = 0;
 blackburn	feature_matrix_num_features = 0;
 blackburn	num_features = 0;
 blackburn	num_vectors = 0;
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	not a cache bug
 blackburn	as expected
@sonney2k	blackburn, clean the cache / preprocs
 blackburn	sonney2k: ? how?
@sonney2k	look at Features.h for preprocs
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r78c8694 / src/shogun/features/StringFeatures.h : fix documentation of clean_feature_vectors - http://git.io/hHd-yA
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to handle with cache?
 blackburn	there is no clean
@sonney2k	feature_cache = NULL
 blackburn	?!
@sonney2k	also drop subset
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really needed - it is intended that features will be deleted after stealing
@sonney2k	still
@sonney2k	if someone then accesses this object later it should die sanely
@sonney2k	so better remove more
 blackburn	k
@sonney2k	java / ruby modular went through
@sonney2k	python too
@sonney2k	csharp had an internal error (gcc4.6)
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw just one mad idea - shouldn't it be possible to somehow split the huge generated swig file?
@sonney2k	and then later just join it for linking?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	how can it help?
 blackburn	swig file = .cxx?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well compiling files of size 1MB is better than compiling files of size 20MB
 blackburn	I guess compiling 20*1mb will took even a little more than 20mb
@sonney2k	blackburn, but it can be done on multiple CPUs and won't require 3G of memory but 1/20th of that
 blackburn	hmm yes
 blackburn	I have no idea how to get it done
 blackburn	uh there are a lot of files to commit
 blackburn	I'm sorry but I have no power to split it into commits
 shogun-buildbot	build #283 of python_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/283  blamelist: sonne@debian.org

 blackburn	sonney2k: a little intrusive change :D
 shogun-buildbot	build #284 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/284
@sonney2k	blackburn, I've learned at work some extreme programming...
@sonney2k	and one rule there is that someone else has to review the code before it gets accepted into the project
@sonney2k	I think it would be a nice idea to apply this here too
@sonney2k	then we could each work on our local github forks
@sonney2k	and issue pull requests for each other :)
@sonney2k	and you would know what I am doing and vice versa
 blackburn	sonney2k: for only two of us that would be a waste of time
@sonney2k	I don't think so
@sonney2k	it helps finding bugs early
 blackburn	sonney2k: but doing all the things through pull requests is a good thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen how it is done in scikit-learn?
@sonney2k	what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: they do a lot of pull requests
 blackburn	I guess there is no direct access
 blackburn	sonney2k: but we both doing a lot of small fixes, etc
@sonney2k	well there is but I think it is just better that code gets a review...
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	I mean usually it is easy :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so you are doing *extreme* programming at your job?
@sonney2k	I am doing extreme extreme programming
@sonney2k	or extreme^3 programming even ;-)
 blackburn	lucky one, I do only bugfixing on my job :D
 blackburn	cause netcracker oss is a piece of shit made by crazy students
 blackburn	(like me)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is this: examples/undocumented/python_modular/serialized_svm.bz2
 blackburn	oh sh
 blackburn	junk
@sonney2k	and examples/undocumented/python_modular/vw_cache.dat.cache
@sonney2k	in your last commit
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * r864758f / (2 files): Removed junk from the last commit - http://git.io/CLvrTA
@sonney2k	btw put the copyright to sth reasonable (to you for example)
@sonney2k	blackburn, another crap file : src/interfaces/python_modular/Converter.
@sonney2k	blackburn, and you forgot the documentation
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw you can shorten statements like this:
@sonney2k	SGMatrix<float64_t> new_feature_matrix = SGMatrix<float64_t>(m_target_dim,N);
@sonney2k	SGMatrix<float64_t> new_feature_matrix(m_target_dim,N);
 blackburn	I know
 shogun-buildbot	build #210 of lua_modular is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/lua_modular/builds/210  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 shogun-buildbot	build #218 of csharp_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/csharp_modular/builds/218
@sonney2k	blackburn, really lots of changes... but should be much nicer now
@sonney2k	and one could even move the *obtain_from* functions from and turn them into converters
 blackburn	at least we can do embeddings in more clear way
@sonney2k	anyway it is late and time to sleep!
 blackburn	I'm deadly tired :D
 blackburn	O(you)
@sonney2k	and I am sick even
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	I hope you will recover soon
@sonney2k	but slept long hours at day time
@sonney2k	th
@sonney2k	x
@sonney2k	anyway
@sonney2k	sleep time!

@sonney2k	you missed one example it seems
 blackburn	uh
 blackburn	ok

@sonney2k	blackburn, we need to get rid of ant in java
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you propose?
@sonney2k	it is really a useless requirement
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * r5cec685 / (2 files): Updated lua isomap example - http://git.io/7WEsTQ
@sonney2k	just use jar manually to create the pkg
@sonney2k	like I use gac for c#
 blackburn	I'm not a pro with doing such things
@sonney2k	me neither
@sonney2k	but ant is really not required just to create a .jar
@sonney2k	anyway I am done for now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
