 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey, so I will probably push the changes for the website within a few days
 n4nd0	I have to adjust the models a bit
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 blackburn	do you know how to handle that gmock thingy?
 n4nd0	blackburn: to run the tests?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah, there was an issue with installation of gmock
 n4nd0	ahm
 n4nd0	I could run the tests yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you have gmock as a package?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, make sure to use django_evolution for the model change
 n4nd0	blackburn: no IIRC
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham, good to know before I start with it :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: does it take care of not messing with the current db?
 n4nd0	blackburn: gtest was available as a package in arch but no gmock
 blackburn	so you installed gmock manually but gtest was installed using your package manager?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yep
 n4nd0	blackburn: so you fixed tapkee finally!
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah no leaks
 n4nd0	it was this initializatoin right?
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/compare/17d6ba9eb5fe...c4d485eea074
 n4nd0	the issue of the unconditional jumps
 n4nd0	or conditional :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: well totally wrong feature vector access callback
 blackburn	n4nd0: one parameter in lltsa was uninitialized too
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	m_nullspace_shift
 blackburn	so now everything is smooth
 n4nd0	I changed that one locally but the errors were still there
 n4nd0	so it must be ^ what I missed
 blackburn	yes, because callback was wrong anyway
 blackburn	it was *double* uninitialized
 blackburn	so even greater entropy
 n4nd0	cool
 blackburn	our goal is communism^W more entropy for everyone!
 blackburn	ohkay I can't compile gmock
 n4nd0	blackburn: did you find it out by inspection or use a tool to point out what was uninitialized?
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	mmm what happens with your gmock?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no only I used that inter-ear nerve
 blackburn	I used only*
 blackburn	./libtool: eval: line 7848: syntax error near unexpected token `('
 blackburn	ghm
 n4nd0	I prefer the first, it sound master yoda-ish :D
 n4nd0	sounds*
 blackburn	n4nd0: I yes speak sometimes yodish
 n4nd0	cool that is
 blackburn	force the may be you with
 n4nd0	hahaha
 blackburn	compile let shogun me
 n4nd0	in a couple of months the may be with me
 blackburn	failed I with compilation gmock of

 n4nd0	the tests run fine here
 n4nd0	make in tests/unit is cool
 blackburn	oh I tried too old gmock I think
 n4nd0	aham, let me check version here
 blackburn	ahh ehmmm
 blackburn	n4nd0: it says it have no install target
 blackburn	how did you install it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: one second
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/downloads/list
 n4nd0	I put that in /usr/local
 n4nd0	unzip and so on
 blackburn	hmm I see
 n4nd0	and I tried that it works fine with the makefile they have there
 n4nd0	I runs some dummy test I think
 n4nd0	and later got my shogun configure script to recognize both gtest and gmock
 blackburn	I *LOVE* when people don't provide any install target
 blackburn	yeahh
 blackburn	n4nd0: sonney2k: wiking: http://pcottle.github.com/learnGitBranching/
 n4nd0	blackburn: got it to work?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	wow fancy page
 blackburn	awesome
 n4nd0	blackburn: this is really cool
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah git is pretty difficult - nice way to learn
 n4nd0	indeed

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fixed wrong spectrum mismatch rbf construction in static interfaces
 blackburn	heiko: about https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/880 - I am not sure what should we do with it but actually that patch helped
 heiko	yeah I saw this, I will have a look, but good if it works for now
 heiko	not too sure whether this is a good idea
 heiko	but on the other hand, we need to allow NULL parameters
 blackburn	heiko: I think it is a good idea anyway as there is no check for null afterwards
 blackburn	so passing null there is wrong anyway

@sonney2k	blackburn, about https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/881
@sonney2k	what is the example failing?
 blackburn	sonney2k: base_map_parameters in libshogun
 blackburn	it is not failing w/o valgrind
@sonney2k	should be easy to fix for me. I will do it when I have time
@sonney2k	tonight
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am just unsure who should free the memory
 blackburn	that's why I didn't approach to fix it

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: don't use ref'counted matrix in parameter example (fixing double free!)
 blackburn	sonney2k: straightforward :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wonder how difficult it would be to switch over to using SGSparseMatrix... but better not attempt this if we want to release now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't know actually - seems to be easy but testing..
 blackburn	I'd avoid changes if it works now
