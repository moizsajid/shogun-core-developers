 blackburn	wiking: sonne|work I am learning impress.js and JS in general, want to create a cool shogun demo
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	blackburn: jmpress.js ;)
 wiking	blackburn: http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/
 wiking	let's start using std::shared_ptr :DDD
 blackburn	wiking: impress looks simpler
 blackburn	wiking: std? C++ 11?
 wiking	blackburn: yep
 blackburn	wiking: we are 89
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	ic :)
 blackburn	wiking: what's up with your paper? are you in time?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	got an extension of 5 days :D
 wiking	i'm in lack of good dataset currently
 wiking	i haven to create one asap
 blackburn	wiking: what you want to detect?
 blackburn	medical things?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	medical
 blackburn	omg I recalled that dataset
 blackburn	(the one we failed to work on)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	with all these
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	wait a minute I have to vomit :D
 blackburn	wiking: is that for journal or conference?
 wiking	conf
 blackburn	hmm probably bad question as you have deadline
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	only 4 pages i'll have to do
 blackburn	wiking: I could read it thoroughly if you need
 wiking	heheh first i need to write it :)
 wiking	but yeah awesome thnx!
 blackburn	hahah okay
 blackburn	wiking: it seems that the method matrices of which we have been discussing works
 blackburn	but something is wrong still
 blackburn	*but* still
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	it would be a breakthrough for me, such large scale eigendecompositions are *linear* in size
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah do it :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: my idea is to add a drawing canvas
 sonne|work	blackburn: d3js + svg
 blackburn	sonne|work: what for?
 sonne|work	drawing canvas & whatever you want to do
 blackburn	sonne|work: no I mean I want an OCR interactive example
 blackburn	right in presentation
 sonne|work	yeah that would work but some html5 based stuff would work too
 blackburn	sonne|work: the only thing is that I'll probably would have to write a classifier in js too
 blackburn	with learned model
 sonne|work	blackburn: no. use the one we have from python
 blackburn	sonne|work: and where to run it?
 sonne|work	we can then just use a little bit of ajax to get the data over
 sonne|work	on the webserver of course
 sonne|work	recall it is all django
 sonne|work	so easy
 sonne|work	just assume you get the image transferred to the server
 sonne|work	and have it in some variable X
 blackburn	ah okay I'll write a JSON-based classifier then
 blackburn	sonne|work: is our webserver powerful enough?
 sonne|work	for digit recognition? anything would be :D
 blackburn	I start liking living on this planet
 sonne|work	...finally :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: so I put an application to that server
 blackburn	and js presentation just asks it to classify
 blackburn	looks nice
 sonne|work	blackburn: checkout shogun-web
 sonne|work	get it running locally
 sonne|work	and then write it all in there
 blackburn	sonne|work: okay
 blackburn	nice idea
 sonne|work	ask if you don't know
 blackburn	don't know what?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'll get to it in not less than 4 hours anyway though
 sonne|work	blackburn: I'd like to have the toy svm examples too on the website... so clicking dots etc
 sonne|work	ok then ask tomorrow
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can put an array of various road signs
 blackburn	and once user clicks it sends to server
 blackburn	classifies and gets back the result
 sonne|work	that would be cool
 blackburn	sonne|work: and some ACTG stuff would be cool too
 blackburn	but it would require more programming
 sonne|work	what do you have in mind?
 sonne|work	we have the splice site detector in applicatons
 blackburn	sonne|work: well some snake like ACTCTCTGGTCATCGGCC...
 blackburn	sonne|work: and bam! - detected
 sonne|work	it would be easy to score splice sites this way
 blackburn	sonne|work: so user just moves mouse over dna chain
 sonne|work	or arts / tss
 blackburn	and once it scored
 blackburn	bingo
 sonne|work	it is more like drawing a graph on top of the ACTCAGTCATGAC
 blackburn	sonne|work: like that?
 blackburn	sonne|work: with such showcase we will get some fans heh
 wiking	i have stupid actc data here
 sonne|work	blackburn: actually quite motivating for me - we have so many algorithms but showcases are just missing
 wiking	but it aint' working forme :(
 blackburn	sonne|work: okay let me start with OCR and then we will see
 wiking	sonne|work: u r working for tomtom?
 sonne|work	yup
 sonne|work	wiking: want me to create a jam ;-)
 wiking	i've just got a job inquiry for their gent office :P
 wiking	"I am contacting you on behalf of TomTom's operations, located in Gent. We are looking to expand our R&D centre and are looking for experienced engineers with a strong background in development. "
 blackburn	come on, where is my job inquiry :D
 wiking	bla bla bla
 wiking	:)
 sonne|work	where is Gent?
 wiking	sonne|work: belgium
 sonne|work	not my planet ;-)
 blackburn	BE
 wiking	:DDD
 blackburn	sonne|work: even I know!
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	need a dataset
 wiking	blackburn: create me one!
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: I have no tumors I hope
 wiking	blackburn: ehheheh
 blackburn	I would help you if I could but come on let me live a little more :D
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	any latent dataset will do it :D
 wiking	i have currently one with good results
 wiking	but that ain't enough :)
 blackburn	wiking: how is your paper called?
 wiking	blackburn: notitle :)
 blackburn	nice title!
 wiking	for example
 wiking	we have everything for this paper: http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rbg/papers/grammar-nips11.pdf
 wiking	just data is missing
 blackburn	wiking: everything like?
 wiking	everything :)
 wiking	like classifier
 blackburn	wiking: did you read that paper carefully?
 blackburn	I am just curious whether it is worth reading
 wiking	blackburn: yeah i've read the previous one
 wiking	without the grammar hack
 wiking	this one i've just skid through
 wiking	so i know what they are using there
 wiking	and we have everything
 wiking	except the feature generator
 wiking	lolface
 blackburn	wiking: will that work realtime?
 wiking	'realtime'
 wiking	well once you have a classifier (training takes quite some time)
 wiking	it's more-or-less a dot product :P
 blackburn	wiking: I didn't realize how do they put these bboxes
 wiking	well you have 2 filters
 wiking	root filter and part filter
 wiking	and then where you have 'activity'
 wiking	you draw around a bounding box
 blackburn	okay you convinced me
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	lolface
 wiking	i've got a second job inqury
 wiking	what's today?
 wiking	blackburn: the felzen... hog detector you can haz for python
 wiking	blackburn: https://github.com/cvondrick/pyvision
 blackburn	wiking: wow I should try
 wiking	he implemented the exact same hog extractor that they use in that paper
 wiking	basically he just made a python wrapper for it
 blackburn	so it is that
 blackburn	deformable model thing
 wiking	yeps
 blackburn	will try today thanks
 wiking	i haz no numpydoc pacakge
 wiking	ahahah lol

 fmailhot	Greetings shogun folk! I'm having some issues compiling on CentOS, and finally figured out that I've got an unsupported version of gcc...
 blackburn	sonne|work: still at work?!
 sonne|work	fmailhot: I am on centos here too
 fmailhot	What's the most recent gcc you support? (or is there some workaround for the 4.1)
 blackburn	sonne|work: too?
 sonne|work	I have gcc 4.4.6 though
 blackburn	what makes you use it :)
 sonne|work	the same reason you use windows :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: uh I see, strange company you work in :)
 blackburn	fmailhot: I think 4.4 is needed
 fmailhot	I see...so the short version is "upgrade your gcc"...OK, I'll see if I can convince my ops ppl to do that.
 fmailhot	Thanks!
 blackburn	but sonne|work knows better
 blackburn	fmailhot: 4.1 is waaaaay too old
 blackburn	;)
 fmailhot	Fair enough! :D
 wiking	fmailhot: <4.3
 wiking	fmailhot: you dont need to upgrade
 wiking	fmailhot: stick with your old gcc
 fmailhot	configure script is failing
 fmailhot	"no C compiler detected"
 wiking	fmailhot: and install as well the new one
 wiking	fmailhot: which version of centos are u using
 wiking	?
 wiking	fmailhot: 6?
 fmailhot	5.5
 fmailhot	I don't have control over that, unfortunately
 wiking	fmailhot: x86_64 or i386?
 fmailhot	x86_64
 wiking	fmailhot: gcc44-4.4.6-3.el5.1.x86_64.rpm
 wiking	fmailhot: it has it :)
 wiking	fmailhot: so just install gcc44 package
 wiking	out of box
 wiking	it will not interfere with your default gcc
 wiking	http://centos.mirror.netelligent.ca/centos/5/os/x86_64/CentOS/gcc44-4.4.6-3.el5.1.x86_64.rpm
 wiking	;)
 wiking	http://centos.mirror.netelligent.ca/centos/5/os/x86_64/CentOS/gcc44-c++-4.4.6-3.el5.1.x86_64.rpm
 fmailhot	Will the shogun configure script find it even though I've got the default gcc?
 wiking	as well
 wiking	but i guess you can install it via the package manager of centos
 wiking	fmailhot: you have to specify it
 fmailhot	Doh...right.
 fmailhot	OK, that's excellent...thanks wiking!
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] sonney2k pushed 2 new commits to master: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/compare/528ccfd8a5cf...363cb876f9eb

 wiking	fmailhot: ./configure --cc=path/to/the/gcc44 --cxx=path/to/the/g++44
 sonne|work	I don't have to do *anything* special here for it to work...
 wiking	sonne|work: well because your defult gcc is 4.3 or later
 wiking	;)
 wiking	or?
 wiking	sonne|work: i dont have to do anything either as my default compiler is clang :P
 wiking	fmailhot: if u dig in the archives of shogun mailing list
 wiking	fmailhot: you'll have some more info about this
 wiking	but in the nutshell you'll have to do that what i said above :)
 fmailhot	Excellent...thanks very much! I'm looking forward to trying shogun out. Saw a presentation last week in NYC as was pretty excited by it.
 wiking	fmailhot: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/3019
 wiking	check this thread
 wiking	it says everything about it
 wiking	fmailhot: heheh great! :)
 wiking	fmailhot: if u wanna use python i guess you'll have to install swig2 for yourself
 wiking	as well
 wiking	otherwise the python interface will fail
 wiking	but that email conversation covers that topic as well
 wiking	;P
 fmailhot	Sweet...thanks for all of that! Very helpful...
 wiking	sonne|work: we need FAQ :D
 sonne|work	wiking: feel free to edit the website :)
 wiking	sonne|work: under documentation?
 wiking	or brand new menu?
 sonne|work	as you wish
 wiking	i would put it directly
 wiking	so that everybody can find it right away
 sonne|work	then do :)
 sonne|work	but don't keep it empty
 wiking	okok cool
 wiking	yeah i'll add the swig and gcc question/answer
 sonne|work	maybe merge in http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/faq.html
 wiking	as this is already the second time ...
 wiking	and i'm guessing not the last time
 sonne|work	yeah well
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll merge this faq as well

 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: why?
 blackburn	n4nd0: he seems to be django guru right?
 n4nd0	blackburn: well, he knows how to use it
 n4nd0	he is not online right now I think, he's probably having dinner
 blackburn	n4nd0: I want to develop a page that 'answers' with JSON by JSON
 blackburn	I mean JSON input JSON output
 blackburn	n4nd0: there are a lot of various blogs/questions about that but no unified solution
 blackburn	may be something more elegant can be used
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can ask him
 n4nd0	or tell him to appear around later
 blackburn	ok please ask when he is online
 blackburn	or that, yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you seen that impress.js?
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored
 n4nd0	yeah, I think a friend told me about it
 blackburn	I am fascinated, we need such thing for shogun showcase
 blackburn	so I want to create a JSON-based service for a few examples
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	problem is that I am already dying with all these things :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you mean dying with all these things?
 n4nd0	too much work or?
 blackburn	too many directions
-!- bern4rd [53b32cfa@gateway/web/freenode/ip.83.179.44.250] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	bern4rd: blackburn, here you go
 blackburn	ha!
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	bern4rd: okay my question is pretty simple I think
 blackburn	bern4rd: I want to provide a json api
 blackburn	on our django website
 blackburn	do you know how can I proceed?
 bern4rd	I have never used json with django. The idea of using json is related with rss?
 blackburn	bern4rd: well I do not really need json exactly
 blackburn	but some custom python driven page that answers with some output
 bern4rd	I dont understand what you mean
 blackburn	bern4rd: I want to have sth like http://shogun-toolbox.org/recognizer
 blackburn	that is driven by python code
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is driven python code?
 blackburn	n4nd0: driven by :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: I want to have a page that is fully controlled by python script
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 blackburn	like java servlet
 n4nd0	bern4rd: does that make sense to you?
 bern4rd	well I have never done that, so I have no idea.
 blackburn	argh, I see
 blackburn	okay no problem I will find out sth later
 n4nd0	bern4rd, blackburn: so with django you don't to a page that is controlled by python?
 n4nd0	don't do*, sorry
 blackburn	n4nd0: well they are set up in a database as articles
 bern4rd	I am not sure if you mean, download the page once, and then is controlled itself without rest comunication with the server.
 bern4rd	Do you mean that?
 n4nd0	blackburn: so it is not the same I guess
 blackburn	bern4rd: no, I want a JSON api with server
 blackburn	so just need to have a communication point

 blackburn	wiking: where to get data for that pyvision? :D
 fmailhot	Hello again, shogun folk...another couple of compilation questions:
 fmailhot	1) should I worry about all the clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-fBLAHBLAH' warnings?
 fmailhot	2) can someone have a peek at this pastebin and see if they can decipher the error? http://pastebin.com/J78hmY8K
 fmailhot	Googling hasn't turned up much that's useful...
 n4nd0	fmailhot: I've never tried to compile whole shogun with clang
 n4nd0	first time I see that error too
 fmailhot	What's weird is that I'm seeing invocations of gcc in there, too, even though I specified clang for the configure script
@sonney2k	fmailhot, did you specify it for linking too?
@sonney2k	fmailhot, upload your .config to pastebin
@sonney2k	fmailhot, and FWIW - I compile w/ clang here :)
@sonney2k	so does wiking
 fmailhot	Oops. I did not, in fact, specify it for linking, too. /facepalm
@sonney2k	fmailhot, but the problem is some /darwin in there - wtf?!
@sonney2k	please check if you have some /darwin in .config
@sonney2k	if so remove it
@sonney2k	how did it get there???
 fmailhot	http://pastebin.com/nSNCznR9
@sonney2k	INCLUDES_JAVA_MODULAR
@sonney2k	remove that line please
 fmailhot	Ah,ok
 fmailhot	Hmm, also
 fmailhot	INCLUDES_JAVA=  /darwin
@sonney2k	just drop this line
@sonney2k	you don't have java anyways
 fmailhot	Right, nm prev
 blackburn	how did darwin get in there

 fmailhot	(and thanks!)
 blackburn	fmailhot: so you were attracted by christian's talk?
 fmailhot	Yeah...I only caught the talk end of it, but that was enough! I'd heard of Shogun before, but never got around to checking it out. Been using scikit-learn and am curious to compare the two.
 fmailhot	s/talk/tail
 blackburn	I am looking forward to see his talk (they wanted to post videos)
 fmailhot	They said to expect roughly a one-week delay before the vids would be posted.
 blackburn	I see
