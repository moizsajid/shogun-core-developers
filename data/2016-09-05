 sanuj	wiking, yo! you around?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	whatsup
 sanuj	i need some research advice :D
@wiking	lol go ahead
 sanuj	how is IST Australia?
 sanuj	Austria*
 sanuj	and INRIA france
 sanuj	if you happen to know anything about them
@wiking	i know that inria is good
 sanuj	and can you suggest some good places to apply in europe/UK
@wiking	dunno anything about ist
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	so it's really confusing to decide what i would like to work on
 sanuj	but i want to be in this direction
@wiking	which direction? :)
 sanuj	to make sense of data - text, video
@wiking	till now uk institutes had good funding
 sanuj	like humans do :P
@wiking	but that was because of EU
 sanuj	i see
@wiking	now i guess that's gonna be less
@wiking	KTH is a good school in stockholm
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	will look for research groups there
@wiking	it's worth to look around
@wiking	for current phd positions
 sanuj	how much time does phd take in europe?
 sanuj	in US it takes 5-6 years
 sanuj	in UK 3-4 years
@wiking	http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/apply-now/jobs-for-you/index_en.htm
@wiking	check these
@wiking	depends
 sanuj	as of what i have heard
@wiking	if you get an EU funding
@wiking	that's only for 3 years
@wiking	but you need at least 4
@wiking	so usually they'll get you a bridging scholarship
@wiking	to finish up
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i want to work in industry research
 sanuj	after my phd (if i do one)
@wiking	:)
@wiking	well we all have dreams :)
 sanuj	haha
@wiking	but yeah usually marie curie scholarship
@wiking	have a direct connection with the industrie
@wiking	so if it's executed right
@wiking	you can work with industrie
 sanuj	okok
 sanuj	i can't go to JHU anymore
 sanuj	cause they won't be able to fund it due to some new law
 sanuj	so i'm looking for new places now
@wiking	ah that's too bad :(
 sanuj	it would have been better if they had told me earlier
 sanuj	i waited for >1month for visa paperwork
 sanuj	could have applied to other places

 sanuj	HeikoS, i'm doing david silver's RL course
 sanuj	right now
@HeikoS	sanuj: via video?
@HeikoS	cool!
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	its a good course
@HeikoS	a bit dry maybe ;)
 sanuj	dry?
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	you know
@HeikoS	as in not too exciting
@HeikoS	but very good course nonoftheless
 sanuj	ah, i see
 sanuj	is RL relatively new compared to rest of ML
 sanuj	most of the people are from univ of alberta
@HeikoS	no its not too new
@HeikoS	ever since the word ML was around
@HeikoS	but popular it is only recently
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'm looking for research internships again
 sanuj	do you know some good places in europe
@HeikoS	didnt you find one?
 sanuj	i did
 sanuj	but i can't go to JHU because of some funding problems due to some new US federal employment laws
@HeikoS	Ah I see
 sanuj	they won't be able to pay me
@HeikoS	yeah funding is always an issue
 sanuj	wiking told me about KTH
 sanuj	stockholm
@HeikoS	yeah good place
@HeikoS	Copenhagen has  a a good uni as well
@HeikoS	(and probably more funding than the US places)
@HeikoS	UK is top, but funding is a problem for non eu members
@HeikoS	Berlin in Germany maybe, but it is less international
@HeikoS	I gotta run now
@HeikoS	will come back more over the next few days
@HeikoS	see you soon!
 sanuj	okok

 CaBa	wiking: i'm on a conference at the moment, i guess we're having a hard time catching each other here ;)
 CaBa	wiking: any thoughts on the PR?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	which?
 CaBa	aah
 CaBa	:)
 CaBa	ECCB, The Hague
@wiking	no i mean which pr
 CaBa	ah... well the old story with get_value() and get_label()
@wiking	ah but that pr did not change anything on the end
@wiking	or?
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	wiking: yes, it changes get_value() -> get_label() for the ground truth
@wiking	ah ok
 CaBa	wiking: i wrote down my thoughts about the issue in the PR comments, i'm not sure what the design of the label class is supposed to provide here... anyways, ground truth labels can come with uninitialized confidence values (they are synced with the labels only if all labels are provided upon construction), i think either one should make sure that is detected or one should use the labels or both...

 CaBa	wiking: yeah or PM or just the PR comments ;)
