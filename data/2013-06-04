@iglesiasg	gsomix: what is it about? the one at the end
 gsomix	iglesiasg, big state exam in general physics
@iglesiasg	it sounds hard indeed!
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I think everything will be fine. this is hard year in uni, next will be more easy: just some interesting classes and getting bachelor's degree
@iglesiasg	good night people
 gsomix	nite

@sonney2k	foulwall, hey there!
 foulwall	sonney2k: I'm trying to compress the messy js in a single file, almost finished
@sonney2k	foulwall, yeah I've seen that complexity went down quite a bit!
@sonney2k	foulwall, happy to see that :)
 foulwall	sonney2k: haha
@sonney2k	foulwall, you can assume to have the +/-1 coordinate system in all the examples
@sonney2k	also in clustering I mean
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@sonney2k	and classification
 foulwall	sonney2k: but when we want to import custom data, I'd better make it scalable?
@sonney2k	foulwall, yes - but you did that already. I mean by default -1/+1 for everything. For loading data we do sth different
 foulwall	sonney2k: ok~
@sonney2k	foulwall, btw I will reply to cheng's email
 foulwall	sonney2k: ok~
@sonney2k	foulwall, ohh and I never know what your real name is or how I should call you in emails

 thoralf	Hey guys.
 thoralf	I just sent a small patch for a segfault in CMath::qsort(), which also affects SGVector.qsort().
@iglesiasg	hey thoralf, I just commented your patch
@iglesiasg	thanks for it!
@iglesiasg	just send it against develop please
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Okay, no problem.  But you should update your documentation. ;)) See: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/devel.html
 thoralf	Section VERSIONING SCHEME:
@iglesiasg	yeah
@iglesiasg	we should indeed
@iglesiasg	sorry about that
@iglesiasg	feel free to send another patch with the doc update :)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I just found out github allows to send pull request against arbitrary upstream branches.
@iglesiasg	you should actually be using another branch too btw
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.3.7] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	lol, fail
 thoralf	iglesiasg: That's right.
@iglesiasg	the idea is that your master in synced with upstream master, your develop with upstream develop and you submit patches from new feature branches
 gsomix	hello
@iglesiasg	hey gsomix
@iglesiasg	why fail? :)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, but I think it should be fine to merge it like it is this time
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Btw, my orignal PR was against shogun/develop.
@iglesiasg	iglesiasg, oh fuck yes
@iglesiasg	it was the same
@iglesiasg	epic fail
 thoralf	iglesiasg: But I will switch to develop locally, anyway.  Thanks for telling. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, ok, sorry for my misunderstanding
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I'm just stupid, huh. will try tomorrow again. :)

@iglesiasg	thoralf, as far as I can tell it doesn't seem to be our fault
@iglesiasg	thoralf, bsd1 seems to fail sometimes because of the swig2.0 option

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: errm did somebody commit to master?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: only in master this option is unknown...

 thoralf	Some examples in examples/undocumented/libshogun are expecting -lpthread, may I send a PR with fixed Makefile (LIBS_ADD=... -lpthread)?
@iglesiasg	the -lpthread issue seems to be always around
@iglesiasg	I honestly  don't really get when it is needed and when not
 thoralf	iglesiasg: There are two or three tests, which are depending on -lpthread.
 sonne|work	thoralf: no
 thoralf	sonne|work: So why are they failing?
 thoralf	sonne|work: Okay, one step back - which part exactly are you rejecting? ;)
 sonne|work	thoralf: no to add this to the Makefile
 sonne|work	thoralf: when you run make check-examples from the src directory
 sonne|work	they will be run with additional link flags etc taken from .config
 thoralf	sonne|work: Yes, .config contains come definitions with -lpthread.  But no, when I run make check-examples from src, library_map and classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel always fail.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Just double-checked it on clean upstream/develop
 sonne|work	thoralf: which OS is this?
 thoralf	sonne|work: Ubuntu 13.04
 sonne|work	we do exactly this on all build bots / travis
 thoralf	sonne|work: But Makefile in undocumented/libshogun does not include .config, so how do the options get to the gcc?
 thoralf	error in make classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel CC=c++ LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIB_PATH=~/sg/lib INC_PATH=~/sg/include LIBS=-Xlinker --no-undefined  -lshogun
 sonne|work	thoralf: which examples fail again?
 thoralf	library_map and classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel
 thoralf	classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel: undefined reference to symbol 'pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
 thoralf	library_map: undefined reference to symbol 'pthread_spin_init@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
 sonne|work	OK
 sonne|work	I don't understand why linking against libshogun doesn't help
 thoralf	sonne|work: But why should -lshogun export "foreign" symbols, i.e. symbols of libpthread?
 thoralf	sonne|work: ldd in libshogun.so shows: libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f1d81084000)
 thoralf	nm -C -D libshogun.so.14.0 shows pthread_* functions, but without address.

 sonne|work	thoralf: erm, you don't have to link against blas/lapack when you use libshogun that internally uses it
 sonne|work	so we should somehow get to the same state with libpthread
 thoralf	sonne|work: You're right.  I was expecting library_map using it - but it does not.
 sonne|work	thoralf: hmmhh maybe there is something subtle here
 sonne|work	it uses Map.h which includes pthread

 sonne|work	I guess for locking / thread safety
 thoralf	sonne|work: Yes, I'm already following this trail... :)
 thoralf	sonne|work: If some of the header files depends on pthread_* functions directly, then we're doomed. ;)
 sonne|work	if so we should somehow try to move everything over to a .cpp file

 thoralf	So, what did we found?  Map.h uses pthread_*() directly.  So every use of Map.h introduces a compile-time dependency on pthread-symbols, e.g. -(l)pthread
 thoralf	But this does not (yet) explain classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel
 thoralf	Math.h also depends on pthreads.
 thoralf	Which is used by SVMLight.h
 thoralf	which is used in the example.
 thoralf	q.e.d. ;)

@iglesiasg	hey Rasmi
 Rasmi	ya I want to know when I shall know that I have configured shogun
@iglesiasg	when you run the configure script and no error fires
 Rasmi	Is it that when I write shogun it will show the shogun prompt
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: mmm no, not really
@iglesiasg	you don't get something like Matlab or octave if you are waiting for that
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: have you tried running any of the examples? That should give you a better feeling of it
 Rasmi	no, I think your are not getting what I want to say
@iglesiasg	maybe
 Rasmi	I want to say that when I will write shogun in the terminal it will show me the shogun prompt
@iglesiasg	oh then I got what you said :)
 Rasmi	I have my laptop if you can come to web cam then it will be better
@sonney2k	thoralf, hmmhh but lots more uses CMath
@sonney2k	there is something fishy
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: I think there is no need for that
 Rasmi	I am not getting what to do with this shogun, please help me
 Rasmi	how to configure nad how to use
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: from your other mails I think you have already configured and installed
@lisitsyn	what do you to use it for?
@iglesiasg	now try out some of the examples and you will get a feeling about "what to do with this shogun"
 Rasmi	I am doing my project using SVM
 thoralf	sonney2k: So I think pthreads are not "optional" any more. ;)
-!- vgorbati [~vgorbati@212.2.159.34] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	thoralf, they are optional (otherwise we could not compile under cyg)
 Rasmi	and now my professor told me to solve a problem using shogun
@iglesiasg	wow you have a cool professor!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I've recently seen in a job ad: "requirements: experience in one of R, weka, shogun" :D
 thoralf	sonney2k: You're right.  The problems only arise when pthreads are enabled.
 Rasmi	ok let me try some examples
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: if you want to use it for SVMs and the C++ interface try for instance the example classifier_minimal_svm.cpp
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: nice!
 thoralf	sonney2k: as far as i can see, all the pthread calls are enclosed by "#ifdef HAVEPTHREADS"
 Rasmi	ok
@iglesiasg	Rasmi: just in case, you can find it in <path to your shogun directory>/examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_minimal_svm.cpp
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no way, rly?
 Rasmi	ya I got it
@iglesiasg	ok I've got to go now, I will be back later in a few hours
 Rasmi	that exmple
 Rasmi	ok

@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what are your working hours?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, huh?
@sonney2k	what's wrong?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: just curious
* sonney2k is suspicious now
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: haha no I just want to know when you are at job
@sonney2k	well you talked to me in the morning when I was there and now that I just left :D
@lisitsyn	it floats a bit so I am unsure now
@lisitsyn	like 8 - 17 or what?
@sonney2k	no it doesn't really float
@sonney2k	in this range but my only 8hrs is the standard contract here :D
@sonney2k	but you know when you are just about to finish $FEATURE
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about lunch?
@sonney2k	alrighty gtg
@lisitsyn	I mean 8-17 is 8+1
@lisitsyn	I mean speaking of official stuff I am working 10-19
@lisitsyn	that's 8 hours
 thoralf	Just sent another PR for qsort() in Math.h - this time with unit tests.
 thoralf	(Unit test without assertions, because they're meant to trigger segfaults.)
 thoralf	Damnit.  Found another two potential segfaults in CMath::qsort*().
 thoralf	Before fix, make valgrind gives: ERROR SUMMARY: 42150 errors from 79 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2)
 thoralf	After fix: ERROR SUMMARY: 8076 errors from 75 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2)

@sonney2k	van51, hey!
@sonney2k	van51, good evening
@sonney2k	van51, I've lost your email somehow
 van51	sonney2k: hello
 van51	i'll send it to you then
 van51	sonney2k: at your shogun address, right?
@sonney2k	van51, yes please
@sonney2k	van51, I only recall that sparsefeatures gave you some trouble
@sonney2k	and the feature iterator
@sonney2k	which is not implemented for everything
@sonney2k	van51, let me just explain a bit the idea of dotfeatures
@sonney2k	when you usually do learning you get your features from some domain, say R^n
@sonney2k	so you have all fixed size n-dim vectors
@sonney2k	with dot features you can have features of arbitrary domain
@sonney2k	you can mix dense and sparse features and string features
@sonney2k	all you need is to provide a certain number of operations like add_to_dense_vec
@sonney2k	etc that are defined in dotfeatures
 van51	sonney2k: ok so far
@sonney2k	with these operations one can use quite a number of methods already
@sonney2k	for example linear SVMs like liblinear can be expressed like using these dense_dot, add_to_dense_vec etc
@sonney2k	van51, the good thing about providing these functions is that you only need to operate on non-zero features
@sonney2k	so if you have some hash(word) and you would need to implement add_to_dense_vec
@sonney2k	you would only need to do w[hash(word)]+=some_value
@sonney2k	for all words in a text document
@sonney2k	even though w (the dense vector) might be billion-dimensional
 van51	sonney2k: yeah ok, I get that
 van51	my question was, you usually create a Features object and pass it to a classifier
 van51	doesn't this require the dataset to be in memory?
@sonney2k	now about these feature iterators that failed
@sonney2k	they are there because not all functions can be expressed with dense_dot etc
@sonney2k	idea is that you iterate over the non-zero features.
@sonney2k	(only!)
@sonney2k	it certainly is not that fast to use them but maybe it is worth to make some algorithms work with them...
@sonney2k	van51, that's it
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	van51, yes
@sonney2k	van51, of course we have the same streaming*dotfeatures
@sonney2k	so you can do online learning
 thoralf	van51: I think this topic is related to my work, too. ;)
 thoralf	van51: Can you please talk in public?
@sonney2k	unfortunately we didn't have the shiny unit/integration tests (activated) so we broke quite a bit of the streaming* code
@sonney2k	when we introduced SGVector & friends
@sonney2k	van51, anyway my suggestion would be you start with some very simple function that gets a char[256] array as input
@sonney2k	to tokenize a string
 thoralf	What topic is van51 working on?
@sonney2k	you do that once as shogun preprocessor
 van51	sonney2k: ok w8

 van51	sonney2k: you are referring to the iterator issue, right?
 van51	sonney2k: I thought you meant my email from yesterday in the beginning
 van51	van51: about the iterator, I pretty much figured its usage from the comments
 van51	lol
 van51	sonney2k: but it is implemented in SparseFeatures
 van51	and I am getting a seg fault when calling it
@sonney2k	and once inside dot features

@sonney2k	and train once (with preprocessor) just with liblinear and once with the dotfeatures and liblinear

-!- Netsplit over, joins: shogun-buildbot
@sonney2k	van51, wow all messages in one go
@sonney2k	van51, heh you send me an email but not the one with the iterator stuff
@sonney2k	van51, I need to see the code
@sonney2k	I suspect you are not creating the sparse features correctly
@sonney2k	thoralf, sry was that for van51?
 thoralf	sonney2k: No, just a joke.  "van51, did you run away screaming?" -> "Yes, when you told him to avoid code duplication :)"
 thoralf	Joke was killed by lag.

@sonney2k	van511, so what do we do now? shall we merge your list ->dynarray for combined dot features?
