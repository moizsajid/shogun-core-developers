 wiking	sonney2k: eeeey!!!
 wiking	sonney2k: just realised why submodule will be really bad for unit testing
 wiking	sonney2k: it's gonna be way too complicated to keep the unit testing in synch with shogun itself
 wiking	sonney2k: say you want change some classes in shogun, you push it
 wiking	then you have to push separately in the submodule
 wiking	since if you not, and most of the developers won't as they will not be able to put in 1 PR the new code + the unit tests for it
 wiking	the unit testing will keep on failing...
 wiking	this my 2 cents ;P

 wiking	n4nd0 yes
 wiking	blackburn: ping?
 blackburn	pong
 wiking	blackburn: would u consider using this lib: http://code.entropywave.com/orc/
 blackburn	what for?
 wiking	blackburn: well behind SGVector
 wiking	and SGMatrix
 blackburn	well we have eigen3 for that I think
 wiking	blackburn: mmm that's not replacement :)
 blackburn	wiking: I don't understand what is it then :)
 wiking	blackburn: fuckshit i'm wrong
 blackburn	so if we optimize inner loops with SIMD
 wiking	i mean half
 wiking	wrong
 blackburn	eigen3 does the same via any available SSE
 wiking	so orc is runtime optimizer
 blackburn	run-time? oh
 wiking	blackburn: does eigen do it runtime? afaik it's compile time no?
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	for variable size arrays it does splitting to 128 bits long parts
 wiking	mmm that makes me wonder
 wiking	where's the -DHAVE_EIGEN3 flag
 wiking	when i compile :S
 blackburn	wiking: was it detected on configure?
-!- uricamic1 [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:b07b:e85b:8940:fa6f] has joined #shogun
 wiking	blackburn: fuck it's not detected
 wiking	blackburn: i'll fix the configure script :P
 blackburn	wiking: config script is ok I think
 wiking	blackburn: one flag is missing :S
 blackburn	which one?
 wiking	-I
 wiking	include flag ismissing there
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	okay
 wiking	blackburn: btw why dont u detect it via
 wiking	pkg-config ?
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:4c95:e117:3805:c6f] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 wiking	blackburn: as eigen3 supplies pkg-config files
 blackburn	well it is something common to do that this way in our configure
 blackburn	I don't know
 wiking	blackburn: configure script checks for pkg-config
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	 522     die "pkg-config not detected (required)"
 wiking	blackburn: mmm
 wiking	blackburn: where do u include eigen3 apart from Math.h?
 blackburn	wiking: only in math
 blackburn	it should be included only once to support preprocessor directives
 wiking	ok
 wiking	blackburn: eigen headers should be included only by Eigen/...
 wiking	blackburn: i've just checked the docs
 wiking	of eigne
 blackburn	yeah I think so too
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	ok
 wiking	done
 wiking	it works now
 blackburn	well probably there is a need to add proper include

 n4nd0	wiking: I wanted to comment something about the PR for the testing unit
 n4nd0	wiking: but let me first to read the last comments in the PR
 wiking	n4nd0: just a sec i'm on skype
 wiking	i'll be back in 10
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	ok, heiko and you have already been talking about my concern
 n4nd0	I think the best option is to use another branch, as you suggested in the PR
 wiking	n4nd0: ok sorry i was awway
 wiking	but now back
 wiking	yeah just put there your opinion as well about submodule vs having it in the main repo
 wiking	n4nd0: i have a question related to PrimalMosekSVM
 wiking	i'll dig it out now just a sec
 n4nd0	wiking: ok
 n4nd0	wiking: I am updating that class right now by the way
 wiking	n4nd0: ok let me know how
 wiking	my concern is about argmax in StruturalModel
 n4nd0	there was something that is required for the HMSVM but was not regarded at the beginning
 n4nd0	ok, tell me about it first
 wiking	is that the function for you that finds \hat{y} for you?
 wiking	if i'm not clear what i'm talking about here. just a sec to dig out the equation
 n4nd0	yes, it is
 n4nd0	you can think of it too as the function you use to make predictions (the common apply we have in other machines)
 n4nd0	CLinearStructuredOutputMachine::apply_structured is simply calling this argmax
 wiking	n4nd0: but when you do the learning
 wiking	i mean training
 wiking	it's called as well afaik
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	since it is a cutting plane algorithm
 wiking	yep
 wiking	cool
 wiking	then we'll only need to do a new EnumType for strutural learners :P
 n4nd0	yeah why not
 wiking	i'll need it in LatentSOSVM
 wiking	so that user can choose between solvers
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	the LatentSOSVM inherits from?
 wiking	i thought first about relying on user to supply the so solver
 wiking	but then i thought that it's going to be too complicated.. and just go with simply setting the solver type
 wiking	and i'll do internally everything for the 2 different solvers
 wiking	it's inherited from LinearLatentMachine
 wiking	so has nothing to do in a way with StructuredOutputMachine
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	it'll just contain a CLinearStructuredOutputMachine
 wiking	but that's going to created runtime
 n4nd0	aham, no instantiation of it in the constructor you mean?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	it'll be created in the train_machine function
 n4nd0	ok

 blackburn	wiking: which header?
 blackburn	argh I think I need eigen3 include to some other file
 wiking	blackburn: eigen3
 wiking	as sonney2k told that it's not good that it's included in Math.h
 blackburn	it is being included in every file

 wiking	you went with eigen3.h
 wiking	!!
 blackburn	wiking: why not?
 wiking	:D
 wiking	well it's putting the shit on another shelf
 wiking	but yeah i couldn't solve it better
 wiking	i'm just pulling your leg
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	there you go
 wiking	blackburn: http://media.photobucket.com/image/brute+force+/bjkhawkeye/BruteForce.jpg
 blackburn	well  actually I don't think it is so brute
* wiking runs away in shame :S
 wiking	i mean it's just that it was said that 'no lapack and such in .h'
 blackburn	what's the other way?
 wiking	straight into .cpp
 wiking	no?
 blackburn	to each cpp?
 wiking	well yep
 wiking	if we strictly speaking about this 'no lapack and such ifdefs'
 wiking	then yeah
 wiking	each time u use it somewhere
 wiking	include it
 blackburn	problem is that in case of some cross-dependency or so
 blackburn	and custom options
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	it won't work
 wiking	i see that of course
 blackburn	I am now trying to test blas vs loops vs eigen3
 blackburn	on dot
 wiking	for the order of the ifdefs ? ;)
 wiking	but yeah
 wiking	great idea
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	actually I do a standalone example
 blackburn	wiking: I am confused how to link with blas :D
 wiking	jsut take into the consideration
 wiking	caching
 wiking	since it's really fucking killer
 wiking	when i did some benchmarking about vectors ;)
 wiking	the cache in the cpu is really fucking good actually ;P
 blackburn	yeah I noticed that when element-by-element kernel matrix computation was 2 times faster than jumps from one side of diagonal to the other one

 yoo	good evening all
 blackburn	hey
 yoo	could someone give me plz a small example for iterate over CFeatures or print CFeatures.
 yoo	I have seen get_next_feature and get_feature_iterator but ..
 yoo	(c++)
 yoo	I try something like :
 yoo	void *iterator; float64_t val; int32_t j;             wdfeats->get_feature_iterator(j);             while (wdfeats->get_next_feature(j, val, iterator)){                std::cout << val << std::endl;             }             wdfeats->free_feature_iterator(iterator);
 yoo	ouch sorry for that
 yoo	more like that : http://pastebin.com/uYMQr8TW
 blackburn	yoo: well iterators are pretty crappy way here
 blackburn	they are here just for some compatibility
 blackburn	what exactly do you need?
 yoo	yes thats why I ask :p
 yoo	just iterate and print features
 blackburn	dense?
