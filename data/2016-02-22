@HeikoS	drwiking: around?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: soo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yo
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: let me check what've you done ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its all done in fact :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the "show full listing" thing is missing
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	I've seen your mail
@HeikoS	but that can be added without touching the rst files
 lisitsyn	yes sure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: was just asking wiking about having this in travis
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you have an idea:
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	can we upload the html output from travis to a temp place
@HeikoS	so that one can review the cookbook page in rendered form
@HeikoS	before merging a PR
 lisitsyn	uhmm well we have buildbot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats after merge
 lisitsyn	maybe we can employ that guy
 lisitsyn	ah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but buildbot should do that too
@HeikoS	but to a fixed link
@HeikoS	here I want the PR version
@HeikoS	for reviewing
@HeikoS	oterwise it is annoying, just like for the notebooks (but there we can ask people to post rendered previews)
 lisitsyn	I am not sure if it is right usage of travis..
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so we need some temporary HTTP server for the travis session
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it would just upload it somewhere
@HeikoS	builds it, checks dead links, and then uploads html
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: should be possible, yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you know how to do this?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: actually we can attach to github rest api
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: details please :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: on each PR we can enable github to send some http thing to some.shogun.ml
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok, do you have all you need to set this up?
 lisitsyn	this guy pulls this commit, renders it and then puts a message
@HeikoS	like rights, etc
 lisitsyn	will have to check
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok, let me know the outcome
@HeikoS	I think this might be really useful
@HeikoS	the other thing is adding it in the nightly build
@HeikoS	and have a "release" version on the website later
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and the "full listing"
@HeikoS	thats all
@HeikoS	I think I will merge this to develop today
@HeikoS	undless you have something else

 lisitsyn	I have access to hedonismbot, can try to host it there
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do it ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can I start travis on feature branches?
 lisitsyn	yes I think so
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it is triggered on commits I think
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok
@HeikoS	so we can leave things in feature branch for now
@HeikoS	and test the uploading there
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so hedoismbot then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: wanna do this now?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: will spend some time on that today
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: okok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: will rename sphinx folder to cookbook btw
@HeikoS	and add a cmake option I guess
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: think we should have a cmake option to generate examples as well?
@HeikoS	or enable by default?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: from cookbook?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: which examples?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the meta
 lisitsyn	ah ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: should be on by detailt?
 lisitsyn	yes I think so
 lisitsyn	don't we have that option already?
@HeikoS	and should have option to disable?
@HeikoS	no we deleted it I think
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	let me check
@HeikoS	it is under "enable examples"
@HeikoS	build_examples
@HeikoS	or enable testing
@HeikoS	so Ill add a switch for the cookbook
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	it currently is like this
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: if doxygen is available, it adds doc folder
@HeikoS	should be seperate I guess
@HeikoS	doxygen doc and cookbook
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok ill do this later
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: gotta go now
 lisitsyn	ok
@HeikoS	let me know about the uploading
 lisitsyn	yeah I am checking available software
