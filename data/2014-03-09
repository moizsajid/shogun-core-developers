 PirosB3	what are you looking at?
 dhruv13	PirosB3: K nearest neighbours implementation through kd trees
 PirosB3	did you have expirence with ML before?
 dhruv13	PirosB3: looking at a library which can be possibly bundled along with shogun, called nanoflann...
 PirosB3	cool
 dhruv13	PirosB3: not much with implementing ML algorithms, though i have used them for various programming contests
 dhruv13	PirosB3: like kaggle
 PirosB3	oh cool!

 dhruv13	iglesiasg: hey! can i bother you with something?
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, tell me
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: well, is there a significant difference between approximate knn and what needs to be implemented for the kd tree issue?
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: nanoflann implements ann
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, so when I wrote the issue I was not thinking about ann actually
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: please check https://code.google.com/p/nanoflann/
 dhruv13	iglesiasg:  section 1.6
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, just a kd tree to do conventional exact nn search
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: "what nanoflann can't do"
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, I was thinking about going on to ann once this was done
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, just because I think it is a more natural progression for the person working on that
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: okay, then i think i will have to go with my own implementation of a kdtree
@iglesiasg	learn kd-tree, use it, see limitations on real data and the need of ann
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: okay!
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, having said that
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, that was just my idea, it is not something set on stone
-!- akp_ [67157e4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.76] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, ann is very useful. So the nanoflann integration could be very nice as well
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, I don't see anything about exact/approximate nn search in section 1.6 btw
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: oh sorry, that part is in about
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: "Queries for neighbors around any arbitrary location in space can then be solved quickly and efficiently using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms."
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, all right!
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: the 1.6, point 3 confused me, so i referred to the paper
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: the part about automatic configuration
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: that seems to be in flann, but not nanoflann
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, all right
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: so, for now, i think i will work on nanoflann integration
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, it sounds great!
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: and then try out my own kdtree implementation
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: it will take me a while, since i'm still working around the shogun feature class....
@iglesiasg	dhruv13, sure, no problem at all
 dhruv13	iglesiasg: thanks!

 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
 akp_	I wanted to discuss about the OpenCV interface to shogun toolkit.
 akp_	Do we need a complete implementation here or simply training?>
@wiking	akp_: depends what u wanna do...
 akp_	I am currently developing an interface for the dlib machine learning library.
@wiking	?
@wiking	i guess you are then on the wrong channel mate
@wiking	this is the shogun machine learning library channel
 akp_	No. Sorry to mention the name of the library. But I think I can contribute to this library too.
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	that's great
 akp_	Before that

@wiking	lisitsyn: btw ^
 akp___	ignore my ignorance. What I think is a simple training interface using these non-linear svms
@wiking	akp___: as said... the documentation is quite extensive + examples
@wiking	i suggest check those
 akp___	Well I think you misunderstood what I am saying. Apart from using the current features of shogun, I think we can integrate parts of OpenCV including feature extractio etc into shogun
@wiking	akp___: we do not really want to integrate parts of openc into shogun
@wiking	as shogun is a machine learning library
@wiking	whilst opencv is rather an image processing library
@wiking	but we'd like to have some example applications of opencv and shogun
-!- cameo54321 [2729b2d3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.39.41.178.211] has joined #shogun
 akp___	yeah. That is what I am trying to say.
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	sorry i did not get that...
 akp___	ok. So apart from training, which can be used in examples such as ocr and image classification,
 akp___	Many other examples can be demonstrated.
@wiking	yes indeed
 akp___	I am working in the computer vision for past 6 months.
 akp___	As i have said earlier, my notable implementations include a multi-object classifier and a text segmentation & recognition tool.
 akp___	Having said that, can you say what specific applications of computer vision using your library are you looking for? Just some examples, or a specific example, like say a biometric application using
 akp___	opencv and shogun
@wiking	akp___: well it's really up to you
@wiking	we have not fixed any specifics ... some people already did eigenfaces examples
@wiking	but it can be anything you like
@wiking	or you are interested in
 akp___	ok, great!
@wiking	but since there are like 2-3 students who started working on eigenfaces so that should be excluded from the possible options
@wiking	apart from that
@wiking	it's really up to u
@wiking	we don't have limitations... but please make sure that if u start working on it that we expect you to create an ipython notebook out of that application
 akp___	yeah. sure.
 akp___	THe ipython should contain the appropriate prototype code at the time of proposal?
 akp___	And apart from that,'
 akp___	do we need to submit a demo application using OpenCV and Shogun at the time of proposal?
 akp___	Can I discuss my idea with you in private?
 akp___	chat I mean

@wiking	we don't expect you to create already a notebook for the idea... but you should start working on entrance issues of shogun to get yourself familiarised with shogun

@wiking	HeikoS: i'm just fixing documentation generation atm and i've just remembered last year you and i talking at TU-berlin to have ipython notebooks... it's fucking crazy how much of those we already have now
@wiking	as well as how crazy outdated the doxygen was...
@HeikoS	wiking: hey!
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, the last year brought great improvements
@HeikoS	also unit tests ...
@HeikoS	wiking: we should keep on pushing things :)
@wiking	HeikoS: tell me about lars
@wiking	HeikoS: what do u want there to be eigenized
@HeikoS	wiking: mainly I want to get rid of the un-readable lapack calls
@HeikoS	for multiplications
@HeikoS	like matrix-vector
@HeikoS	and matrix matrix
@wiking	HeikoS: so the agenda is that we get rid of lapack?
@wiking	why
@HeikoS	wiking: I agree, we should do the factorisations via our own interface to exchange backends
@HeikoS	wiking: but for these lower level things, I think maybe lets just use eigen
@HeikoS	wiking: there have been many man ybugs caused by the confusing lapack api.
@HeikoS	wiking: with eigen, code is much more clear and therefore easier to verify
@HeikoS	wiking: lapack has all these parameters in the matrix-vector methods, people confuse them sometimes
@HeikoS	wiking: so its mainly readability
@HeikoS	wiking: also lapack is a pain to link against, eigen is much easier
@wiking	still... there's magma which is exactly like lapack api ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: and I dont know whether it makes sense to overload the SGMatrix multiplication api
@wiking	so what r u going to do then?
@HeikoS	wiking: thats all hidden in the backend
@wiking	well that's why i would do the same
@HeikoS	wiking: I want to have the algorithm code clean and easy
@wiking	lars should be engine independent
@HeikoS	wiking: do you also want that for low-level calls? such as matrix-.vector product
@wiking	if u have lapack u have lapack based lars
@wiking	if u have eigen u have that
@wiking	HeikoS: well on the long run...
@HeikoS	wiking: its very hard to have a unified interface for that
@wiking	HeikoS: think about doint dot product of a large matrix *vector in gpu
@HeikoS	wiking: makes things inefficient sometimes
@HeikoS	think of transposes etc
@HeikoS	wiking: matrix-vector doesnt make sense on gpu
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe matrix matrix does
@HeikoS	wiking: but matrix matrix is alsready openmp'ed in eigen
@HeikoS	wiking: so I would go for that
@wiking	HeikoS: well say matrix is n x n
@wiking	and n is 10000000
@HeikoS	wiking: you cannot store that anyways
@wiking	HeikoS: well maybe shogun cannot
@HeikoS	wiking: the thing about the eigen3-ization also is that people wirte tests and review the code
@HeikoS	wiking: thats a good side effect
@wiking	but come one a normal tesla can store amazing amount of data
@HeikoS	wiking: so I would vote for high level calls via our own backend
@HeikoS	wiking: and multiplications in eigen
@HeikoS	wiking: and maybe change that at some point once we have soe experience how the factorizations work
@HeikoS	wiking: moving from lapack to eigen already has many advantages (intro tasks, tests, bugfixes, much cleaner code)
@wiking	mmm well i just think that throwing out lapack is irresponsible

@HeikoS	wiking: wiking ok what about having some easy api for matrix-matrix and matrix-vector and do everything against that?
@wiking	HeikoS: SGMatrix has that
@HeikoS	wiking: Should not be part of SGMatrix but seperate SGMatrix is mainly a memory wrapper
@wiking	if not then it's a shame and should be implemented :D
@HeikoS	wiking: should be in linalg or so
@wiking	so like a static function
@wiking	mm(matrix,matrix)
@wiking	?
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	wiking: although overloaded operators such as in eigen are much nicer
@HeikoS	wiking: what about transposes and stuff
@wiking	why not SGMatrix::operator*(sgmatrix)
@HeikoS	wiking: eigen does all that in place
 kprah	Hello.
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'nightly_default'
@HeikoS	wiking: mmh, I mean it would be *great* not to write against libs but against a general iunterface
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@wiking	HeikoS: i get that part
@wiking	and i'm up for that
@HeikoS	wiking: but I am also fine with only having high-level calls generalised
@wiking	(see the eigensolver story)
@HeikoS	wiking: since eigen is so good for low-level things
-!- kprah_ [67157e4c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.76] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: and its alspo open-mp'ed for matrix-matrix
@HeikoS	wiking: we just have to activate that
@HeikoS	wiking: so maybe lets do that for now? Could do another project at some point doing the multiplications
@wiking	HeikoS: well if openmp is available then it should be already active.. or?
@HeikoS	wiking: one has to set number of threads in eigen /openmp or something
@HeikoS	they have a howto page
 kprah_	Hello guys. Anyone free?
@HeikoS	kprah, whats up?
 kprah_	Hi.
@HeikoS	wiking: eigen3 also has views and all that, which is really helpful
@HeikoS	wiking: and lots of in-place magic
@HeikoS	thats very hard to put under a unified interface
@HeikoS	wiking: and most gain really is in high level calls
 kprah_	The idea "LP/QP optimization framework caught my eye and I wanted to talk about that.
@wiking	kprah_: shoot
@HeikoS	wiking: vector products are so easy, that its not really a big deal with having different backends, and eigen3 works on parallel stuff
 kprah_	I am a chemical engineering sophomore in my last semester.,
@HeikoS	kprah, for that you should try to catch one of the mentors, try writing to the mailing list and cc them
@wiking	HeikoS: well that's the thing that it does but not always the best solution...
@wiking	HeikoS: /me is the mentor ;)
@wiking	:D
 kprah_	Previous semester in my winter internship, my work invloved
@HeikoS	wiking: haha ok then you deal with that :)
 cameo54321	wiking: HeikoS thanks for bringing up the topic,
@HeikoS	wiking: I am always for step-wise improvements, so lets to the factorizations, that would already be amazing

@wiking	HeikoS: we'll see how goes with the eigensolver unification
 kprah_	usage of various solvers like bonmin and cplex to generate optimal prodUCTS FROM the given set of reactants.
@HeikoS	wiking: but I think those tasks to eigen3-ize things are good since they produce tests and get people involved :) ... We should however work against the new stuff for factorazations, yeah
@HeikoS	cameo54321: what?
@wiking	kprah_: that sounds great
 kprah_	I ended up using CPLEX and bonmin.
 kprah_	My problem there was essentially a mixed integer quadratic programming problem.
@wiking	kprah_: in that task you would need to work a lot designing an interface that can be used regardless of the available solver backend
@wiking	so we could concentrate of course on a given problem as well
 kprah_	Yeah,
@wiking	but the main idea is to do some unification of dealing with solvers
@wiking	as there's like kazzilion of them out there
 cameo54321	I talked with wiking yesterday on bundling the stan issue.. Today I shifted more to exploring shogun's code, GP ipython notebook by roman and your kameleon mcmc implementation
 kprah_	That depends a lot on the given constraints i.e. which solver you are using.
 kprah_	One optimization solver that was one of the most principal one is OPTI toolbox
 kprah_	it is open source and you can see it here. : http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/Wiki/OPTI/
 cameo54321	@Heiko what if i start writing an ipython notebook for the kameleon mcmc by you?
 kprah_	Basically it is a matlab toolbox. But it is very intelligent in itself and chooses the most appropriate solver depending on the condition that you are in
 kprah_	I would like to port it to shogun , from matlab to c++.
 lisitsyn	dear HeikoS I would like to take an opportunity and participate in the project mentored by you, could you kindly tell me how to proceed next?

@wiking	it's a good start to have a look at it
@wiking	but to use that in any way as a reference is a bad idea
@wiking	because you'll limit yourself and not use all the good stuff that c++ offers
@wiking	anyhow of course it's good to have an idea from it

@wiking	but as well do create building blocks for LP/QP solvers
@wiking	like KKT solving etc
 kprah_	Yeah. It is there I think. We can construct it.
@wiking	since there are several functionalities in a qp solver
@wiking	that is the same
@wiking	regardless of the given QP solver...
 kprah_	ok.
 kprah_	So what do you suggest finally then?
@wiking	and the idea was that one would create a reference cone LP/QP solver based on this framework..

@wiking	*right?
@HeikoS	wiking: hey
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@wiking	HeikoS: and then u say wanna call a QR factorization

@wiking	yeah yeah
@HeikoS	just for the algebra
@wiking	that's what i'm talking about
@wiking	so when u did all the algebra
@HeikoS	wiking: eigen3 maps are O(1) to create

 thoralf	Hey Heiko
@HeikoS	thoralf: hey!
 thoralf	HeikoS: Do you have a few minutes for discussing the Multilabel stuff?
@HeikoS	thoralf: yeah, good point
@HeikoS	just going through the 50 emails today ;)
@HeikoS	but almost done by noe
 thoralf	lol
@HeikoS	thoralf: ok 2 mins, I might have to run off at some point
@HeikoS	thoralf: so about those arrays with dynamic length
@HeikoS	thoralf: this is a problem we often encountered, so it would be good to solve it somehow
@HeikoS	thoralf: because then things are serialisable etc
@HeikoS	thoralf: I think in fact there might already be a solution
@HeikoS	thoralf: this one also doesnt work for the modular interfaces
 thoralf	Okay, first point: this array of vectors.  Can you give me a pointer?
 thoralf	Second point: About the modular interfaces, are you sure it doesn't work?
 thoralf	Or what would prevent it from working in modular interfaces?
@HeikoS	thoralf: there is no datatype for those arrays
@HeikoS	thoralf: we can only map data that is possible to represent as shogun types
@HeikoS	thoralf: which means everything that you can register using SG_ADD
@wiking	HeikoS: "The '''compute(SGMatrix)''' method should just be a convenience wrapper for linear operators" why?
@wiking	HeikoS: since actually internally it's the other way round
@wiking	HeikoS: at least in case of DirectEigenSolver...
@HeikoS	wiking: ah for direct solvers it can be like that
@HeikoS	wiking: but then the direct solver has another interface than the sparse one
@HeikoS	wiking: mmh
@HeikoS	maybe that should be like that even
@HeikoS	dense and sparse are two quite different cases
@HeikoS	wiking: for direct solvers, we assume that we can store the matrix
@wiking	Heyeah
@HeikoS	wiking: but still, a linear operator is a more general object than a matrix
@wiking	yeah i got that
@HeikoS	wiking: and even direct eigensolvers can be applied to operators which are not matrices
@HeikoS	matrices <= linear operators
@wiking	i mean i know that in case of an iterative solver it'll be better to have a linop
@HeikoS	wiking: but thats all not really needed
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i've finished basic cs course back in the days of my bsc ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: haha ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: but maybe we should stick to conventions there
@wiking	HeikoS: well if we stick to linops
@HeikoS	wiking: which is: direct solvers take matrices, and sparse ones take sparse matrices or operators
@HeikoS	wiking: thats how matlab and numpy do it
@wiking	then only the users will have to do
@wiking	linop(matrix)
@wiking	which is of course a bit of a shit
@wiking	that's why i've added those
@wiking	HeikoS: i mean what i'm trying to say is that obviously if the user is an idiot
@wiking	that we cannot prevent :)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, its annoying if one actually *wants* to use a matrix, there should be methods for that, that hide all the linear operator crap
@HeikoS	haha ;)
@wiking	HeikoS: eyeah so i would go with
@wiking	EigenSolver has all sorts of pure virtual functions
@wiking	and then some of them are implemented and some not
@wiking	in the given implementation
@wiking	but of course we can follow more strict rules
@wiking	of c++
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah
@wiking	and then only introduce compute(linop) in EigenSolver
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean we can have both right?
@wiking	and only in classs where it actually makes sense to do compute(SGMatrix) we introduce that
@HeikoS	the direct eigensolver just can have another method
@wiking	HeikoS: yea hyeah sure
@wiking	HeikoS: just that then sometimes you'll have do do dynamic_cast
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah exactly, so if you know you are using a direct solver, you can use the compute (SGMatrix), but for things as lambday 's framework, we dont actually know, and need a common interface
@wiking	when u actually want to call that method that is only supported in a given child of EigenSolver
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, but then you need to be sure what it is, which is fine

@wiking	i feel the former solution is more 'standard'
@HeikoS	wiking: prefer that a lot to having all methods in the base class and then get errors at runtime
@wiking	do you?
@wiking	i'm just trying to say that i dont :D
@wiking	it's kind of awkward when there's an API but then you get a runtime error :S
@wiking	at least for me
@wiking	lisitsyn: ^
 lisitsyn	damn
@wiking	btw i think i cleared up some doxygen shit from the mid 2000s ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: verdict?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I don't really get what's you are discussing
@wiking	lisitsyn: base abstract class has all the methods and then depending on the actual implementation some of those methods are not implemented vs abstract base class has only a few methods and then the inherited classes extends the api
@HeikoS	wiking: I think we should capture stuff at compile time
@wiking	in short
 lisitsyn	oh thanks
 lisitsyn	that's really better ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: but its not the biggest deal on earth, more important to actually do this unification, however its done
@HeikoS	wiking: but run-time errors scare people, in contrast to compile errors which scare ourselves ;)
 lisitsyn	why do we need to have these non implemented methods?
@wiking	HeikoS: then the former one is the right way
@wiking	i mean latter
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: dont have to .. this is a design decision
@wiking	lisitsyn: you know one requires dynamic cast the other will just fucking fail runtime :)
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	wiking: what's the class we are talking about?
@wiking	lisitsyn: EigenSolver
@wiking	lisitsyn: MagicMachine2.0
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont have hard feelings about either way, just a slight preference.
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn how to deal with those datastructors of thoralf?
@HeikoS	arrays of different sized vectors
@wiking	HeikoS: std::vector? :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you had a similar problem once right?
@wiking	or what?
@HeikoS	wiking: and interfaces?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah iirc
@HeikoS	wiking: how to pass this around?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: actually fernando had it
 lisitsyn	and well I did some multilabel stuff as well
@wiking	HeikoS: if it's std::vector then it's easy T* &vector[0] :)
@wiking	HeikoS: gimmelinecode
@HeikoS	wiking:  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1958
@wiking	can u tell me a file/line in the diff
@HeikoS	yeah
@wiking	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1958/files#diff-45553468fba83f5a1e68a228853c922dR136
@HeikoS	wiking: line 75 of MultilabelLabels.cpp
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah all that stuff
@HeikoS	wiking:  I dont like creating c -arrays . we moved to SG* for a reason
@wiking	oh yeah :D
 lisitsyn	argh we continue to do shoguncode
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking it would be great if you joined the discussion in this PR
@wiking	HeikoS: DynArray?
@HeikoS	since I dont really know how we should do all that stuff
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah that would be another solution
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am trying to follow this up
@HeikoS	and having different dimensions right?
@wiking	can actually shogun/base/DynArray.h hold SGVector? :D
 lisitsyn	dynarray sgvector
 lisitsyn	sorry it is fuck o'clock
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	heheheh
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	now i recall a moment
@wiking	when i had this shit as well :DDD
@wiking	but cannot recall where was it actually
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn gotta run off now, see you guys later

 thoralf	Hey shogis.
 thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1954 <-- can someone have a look on the PR of Piros?  He gets double-frees -- My suspect is using "exit_shogun()", since we don't use it in any of the python modular scripts...
 thoralf	Any ideas?
@iglesiasg	I am off for today thoralf, sorry
@iglesiasg	too tired already
 thoralf	No problem.
@iglesiasg	I will read it tomorrow if it is still unsolved
 thoralf	Just think if exit_shogun() is neccessary in python modular. ;)
 thoralf	Because I don't know.  The rest is up to Piros.
@iglesiasg	I have never seen/used it in a Shogun program from a modular interface
@iglesiasg	so I don't think it is necessary at all
@iglesiasg	good night!

 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
@HeikoS	lambday: heya
 lambday	HeikoS: ummm I have a doubt
 lambday	HeikoS: in the B-test paper,
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah shoot
 lambday	they show that the mmd estimates converges to Gaussian  - for both under alternative hypothesis (eq. 7, similar to the one for linear time mmd) and null hypothesis (eq. 10, similar to the one when we compute centered kernel matrices eigenvalues)
 lambday	HeikoS: which one should we have?
@HeikoS	let me check
@HeikoS	lambday: null distribution
@HeikoS	thats the one we want
@HeikoS	so 10
@HeikoS	the one with zero mean
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... but then we have to compute the whole kernel matrix, no?
 lambday	I mean, for streaming data
 lambday	it would be problematic
@HeikoS	should not
@HeikoS	why do you think that?
@HeikoS	just checking what C is
 lambday	just above eq 10
@HeikoS	lambday: ah I see. so wait
@HeikoS	these are population expressions
@HeikoS	but we can estimate them in linear time
@HeikoS	that what we have done in the kernel selection paper
@HeikoS	there is a proof that if one constructs a test with a linear time estimate for the variance, this is correct
@HeikoS	you dont need to udnerstand the proof (in fact, I dont really ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: but the estimation is very similar
@HeikoS	lambday: just an online variance estimate of the terms that are averaged over
 lambday	HeikoS: similar to the way linear mmd does it? estimate variance
@HeikoS	lambday: so the code should be almost the same as for the linear time mmd
@HeikoS	yeah
 lambday	so that fits eq 7, doens't it
 lambday	oh no
 lambday	the mean is different
 lambday	there we have 0 mean
@HeikoS	lambday: how do they do it in their codes? constructing the threshold
@HeikoS	lambday: wait ill check
 lambday	HeikoS: var_est = (1 / m2) * cov(hh')
