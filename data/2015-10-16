 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hola
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jojo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: all good?
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: this thing reminded me
 lisitsyn	I thought of running matlab code from python
@HeikoS	oha
 lisitsyn	so shogun would help to use all that research code
@HeikoS	via swig?
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	swig matlab works apparently
 lisitsyn	I mean it would be super good to have some adapter
@HeikoS	yeah the base library, just exposing SWIG stuff without ML, would be a cool thing to have for connecting research codes together I agree
@HeikoS	yeah some minimal thing that is easy to use
 lisitsyn	it needs some proof of concept
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I tend to think it is possible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: agreed
@HeikoS	if we built such a minimal thing that works
@HeikoS	we can then use it from Shogun
@HeikoS	but maintain is as a seperate project maybe
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what is needed ?
@HeikoS	fixed types
@HeikoS	a base class?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet clear
@HeikoS	not sure in fact
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you know property-based testing idea?
@HeikoS	nope
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok basically
 lisitsyn	say you have a function that computes square root
 lisitsyn	to test it you say
 lisitsyn	Test(Function).With(PositiveNumber())
 lisitsyn	it just samples under this condition
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@HeikoS	semi automated unit testing
 lisitsyn	we need some cool api to write such wrappers for code
 lisitsyn	so you describe matrices that should be aligned somehow
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I dont get it, why is that uselful for the wrapper lib?
 lisitsyn	say you have some crazy function
 lisitsyn	learn_hmm(X,y,b,theta)
 lisitsyn	you have no idea what parameters are
 lisitsyn	so to wrap it you should describe what these parameters are
 lisitsyn	and how they relate
 lisitsyn	oops sorry brb
@HeikoS	ok
