 Tanmoy	hmm sploving cld u reproduce ur steps ?
 sploving	my find libsogun.so is in /usr/local/lib
 sploving	so one way use LD_LIBRARY, the other way is rebuid it with : ./configure --prefix=/usr/
 sploving	am i right?
 sploving	LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 Tanmoy	hmm seems fair
 Tanmoy	let me check it out

 sploving	I tried to fix the R-module bug, although I am not familiar with R
 sploving	So I first need build it with "--diable-reference-counting" then enable it. and in the two sce, i test the module example, to see which cause the crash up
 Tanmoy	ok cp libshogun.so.6 nd libshogun.so.9 to ur /usr/local/lib
 Tanmoy	thn try it again
 sploving	when i test, i cd examples/documented/r_modular,and run R
 sploving	then I use library(shogun)
 sploving	it shows there is no shogun
 sploving	my /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib both have the libsogun*.so
 Tanmoy	sg
 Tanmoy	library(sg)
 sploving	it works
 Tanmoy	cool
 Tanmoy	now try the rem examples
 sploving	but the examples are all "library(shogun)"
 sploving	the diffirence between the R and R modular is one static, the other dynamic?
 Tanmoy	http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/shogun/RExamples
 Tanmoy	see the .so file
 Tanmoy	u might have gone to the static part and trying the one for modular
 sploving	I need test the modular example
 sploving	i know that i use ./confiugue , it shows SHOGUN was configured for libshogun, libshogunui, python,python_modular, r.
 sploving	there is not r_modular!
 Tanmoy	hold on
 Tanmoy	im reproducing it

 Tanmoy	did u try the ./configure with r_modular
 sploving	i will have a try
 Tanmoy	do let me knw what u r doing
 Tanmoy	ill get back asap
 sploving	it works.
 sploving	so I think the default configure is that disable r_modular
 sploving	but when i make, my os crash down!
 sploving	btw,i used another computer

 Tanmoy	well u c thr r sometimes dependencies which u cannot look into
 Tanmoy	anyway do mail me a detailed step of what u r doing at  mukherjee.tanmoy@gmail.com
 Tanmoy	ill have a look into it
 sploving	I wanted to support the Lua language, but now I think it is more import to fix these bugs
