 gsomix	mechanics is full of pain
 gsomix	depressive lagrangians, suffering hamiltonians and many integrals of fear
 gsomix	they come to me in dreams
 gsomix	and organize an orgy of terror
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	well I still feel excited about Lagrange's stuff
 gsomix	blackburn, my favorite subject is multi-dimensional oscillators

 KMcQuisten	Afternoon Sergey
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	(its me)
 blackburn	:)
 KMcQuisten	I'd guessed :)
 KMcQuisten	So, any ideas as to what the problem is?
 blackburn	okayy let me try to guess
 blackburn	could you please first say what is classifier you do use?
 blackburn	MKLRegression?
 KMcQuisten	I'm working with the MKLRegression
 KMcQuisten	Yes
 blackburn	let me check the code
 blackburn	okay and the problem appears only with combined features, right?
 KMcQuisten	To the best of my knowledge yes.  It worked fine when I gave a single kernel to LibSVR, but I dind't try putting a single kernel into MKLRegression
 blackburn	let me try to come with some reproducing example
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: should it look similar to python_modular/kernel_combined_modular.py?

-!- gsomix [~gsomix@85.26.235.175] has joined #shogun
 KMcQuisten	Yes, essentially, but using StringWordFeatures and the CommWordStringKernel in the Comined objects.
 blackburn	I changed mkl_binclass_modular.py to regression - works
 blackburn	lets see if stringfeatures change the game
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: can I ask you to modify some code meanwhile? some simple thing to debug
 KMcQuisten	Sure
 blackburn	I just want to know where it wants to stop
 KMcQuisten	Right
 KMcQuisten	Just let me know where I need to modify things
 blackburn	shogun/features/StringFeatures.cpp:264
 blackburn	replace SG_ERROR with SG_WARNING and try to recompile
 blackburn	ah and %d after "is" word in msg (I forgot that)
 KMcQuisten	Ok, done.  Now I'll recompile
 blackburn	thanks
 KMcQuisten	Ok, here's what I got.  It looks like we have an index issue:
 KMcQuisten	Spectrum_MKLselect.py:66: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Requested feature vector with index 50 while total num is 50   testsvm.train(combfeats) Traceback (most recent call last):   File "Spectrum_MKLselect.py", line 66, in <module>     testsvm.train(combfeats) SystemError: [ERROR] Trying to access string[50] but num_str=50
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	only 50, but no more, right?
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  I only put in 50 data points as a toy set.  Let me check with the whole dataset
 blackburn	wait wait
 blackburn	ERROR is raised somewhere
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  I think it's trying to access index 50 on a vector that's 0 indexed with 50 items in ti
 blackburn	no, that can go for bigger values (it stopped because of the SG_ERROR)
 KMcQuisten	How is that possible?  If you have a vector of length 50 its highest index is 49.  I get the same kind of error with the full set of 2430 sequences
 blackburn	I mean it can go for 51, etc
 KMcQuisten	SystemError: [ERROR] Trying to access string[2430] but num_str=2430
 KMcQuisten	RIght.  I know i'm not limited to 50 data points
 blackburn	ok let me find this ERROR
 blackburn	I tried to combine string and real features btw
 blackburn	works
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: could you please replace SG_ERROR with SG_WARNING at line 348 too?
 KMcQuisten	sure
 KMcQuisten	I will also try and comine the real and the StringWord
 KMcQuisten	and see if it works for me too
 blackburn	what do you combine?
 blackburn	string and string?
 KMcQuisten	StringWord and StringWord.   DNA sequences mapped into the unsigned 16bit integers.  In python, it's StringWordFeatures, but in the C++ it's StringFeatures<uint_16>
 KMcQuisten	not StringFeatures<char>
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: okay I managed to reproduce
 blackburn	two StringWord feautres
 KMcQuisten	does it work for you?
 blackburn	no dies on the same error
 KMcQuisten	That makes me a happy cmaper
 KMcQuisten	camper
 KMcQuisten	at least it's reproduceable
 blackburn	yeah I'll try to figure out what is wrong
 KMcQuisten	thanks so much!
 KMcQuisten	I've got plenty of other work and writing to do, so i'll just camp here for a while
 blackburn	ok sure
 blackburn	I'll let you know on any progress
 KMcQuisten	Thank you
 gsomix	good night guys
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: hmm as I thought it stopped at 183
 blackburn	92*2
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@85.26.235.175] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 KMcQuisten	What does that indicate?
 blackburn	some code adds number of feature vectors somehow I guess
 blackburn	but it is really strange
 KMcQuisten	What's the significance of the 92 * 2?
 blackburn	number of feature vectors in test example is 92
 KMcQuisten	Ah
 blackburn	and two string word features
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: good thing I detected a bug :D
 KMcQuisten	Indeed.  I changed that error to a warning as you asked before and recompiled, got the following:
 KMcQuisten	Spectrum_MKLselect.py:66: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Requested feature vector with index 2430 while total num is 2430
 KMcQuisten	Spectrum_MKLselect.py:66: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Requested feature vector with index 2431 while total num is 2430
 KMcQuisten	Spectrum_MKLselect.py:66: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Requested feature vector with index 2432 while total num is 2430
 KMcQuisten	Spectrum_MKLselect.py:66: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Trying to access string[2432] but num_str=2430
 KMcQuisten	Segmentation fault (core dumped)
 KMcQuisten	Does the Combinedfeats object adress all the features as thogh they are one long list?
 blackburn	something like that but I do not understand what is the difference between real+string and string+string
 CIA-9	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r3e1dc47 / src/shogun/regression/svr/SVRLight.cpp : Fixed wrong free in SVRLight - http://git.io/n7oILw
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: okay I'm pretty near I think
 blackburn	svr bug
