 uricamic	hi n4nd0

 n4nd0	uricamic: hey
 uricamic	n4nd0: when do you think your changes in SO framework will be pulled to shogun? I want to write a simple example using the BMRM solver, but I think it will be better to do this after your new changes will be accepted
 n4nd0	uricamic: I am not completely sure, I did the pull request and sonney2k told me to make some changes, they were not very important though
 n4nd0	the problem is that currently my multiclass example doesn't work good
 uricamic	n4nd0: any ideas what could be wrong?
 n4nd0	not many, just that there must be a bug somewhere
 uricamic	in the solver?
 n4nd0	I guess so
 n4nd0	there is a thing that bugs me a bit
 n4nd0	right now I use the same data for training and testing
 n4nd0	just to make it easier
 uricamic	ok
 n4nd0	and all the examples of one class are classified as another class
 n4nd0	but still, the values of the slacks after training for those examples are 0
 n4nd0	I think that tells me that something is going wrong
 uricamic	so the classes are swapped?
 n4nd0	not really
 n4nd0	it is that some of the classes used for training are never classified
 uricamic	I see
 n4nd0	I going to compare now how the weight vectors learned in so and in one-vs-rest look like
 n4nd0	I expect that they should be somewhat similar
 uricamic	yep
 uricamic	and you are now working on multiclass example with how many classes?
 n4nd0	I change the number of classes as a parameter
 n4nd0	I am focusing more in three because for two classes looks generally ok
 uricamic	so for 2 classes it works and the problem is only when the number of classes is >2 ?
 n4nd0	yes, apparently
 uricamic	I see, that is somehow strange
 uricamic	do you have the source codes for this pushed in your fork of shogun?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	let me give you the link
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/so/PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp
 n4nd0	there in train_machine
 uricamic	thanks, I will look at it
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/so/MulticlassModel.cpp
 n4nd0	and also in the mathematics/mosek methods used
 uricamic	ok

 n4nd0	uricamic: hey, how is it going?
 uricamic	n4nd0: hi
 uricamic	I have looked on your code, but haven't found anything wrong
 uricamic	but I haven't found the example putting things together
 uricamic	have you commited it to your fork on github?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	I am going to do that now
 uricamic	ok
 n4nd0	uricamic: did you find something that looked weird or you didn't really get it=?
 uricamic	in the MulticlassModel everything looked clear
 uricamic	I will try to combine your up-to-date version of the SO framework and produce the example with the BMRM method and then to compare your solver with mine
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	about the example
 n4nd0	if you would like to test it in your machine, note that you need mosek for that
 n4nd0	and to use mosek within shogun you'd have to change by hand some parameters in your .config
 n4nd0	but I don't think you really need to test it
 uricamic	ok
 n4nd0	I mean, you have done enough taking a look to the core ;)
 n4nd0	code*
 uricamic	but maybe then it will be easier to locate the source of the problem
 n4nd0	ok, as you like
 n4nd0	in any case, if you plan to run it, just tell me to describe you what parameters you need to change to make it run
 uricamic	ok
 uricamic	first I will have to get my solver working
 n4nd0	sure
