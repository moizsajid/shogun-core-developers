@HeikoS	besser82: around?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@besser82	HeikoS, here, sir!
@HeikoS	besser82: hey I get a really weird error
@HeikoS	when compiloing shogun examples by hand
@HeikoS	maybe you know a quick fix
@HeikoS	g++  -I /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/src/:/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/third_party -L /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ shogun-test.cpp -lshogun  -o shogun-test

@HeikoS	shogun-test.cpp:(.text+0x26e): undefined reference to `shogun::SGRefObject::unref()'
@HeikoS	shogun-test.cpp:(.text+0x29b): undefined reference to `shogun::SGRefObject::unref()'
@HeikoS	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
@HeikoS	make: *** [shogun-test] Error 1
@HeikoS	besser82: any idea?
@HeikoS	note that its the only undefined reference
@besser82	HeikoS, try to place "-lshogun" before the source-file...
@HeikoS	then all undefined references pop up
@HeikoS	for all calls
@besser82	g++  -I /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/src/:/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/third_party -L /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -lshogun -o shogun-test shogun-test.cpp
@besser82	HeikoS, ^ should work

@HeikoS	besser82: nope
@HeikoS	all undefined references
@besser82	If you run the binary?  Or during ld?
@HeikoS	ld
@HeikoS	compiling works
@besser82	g++  -I /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/src/:/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/third_party -L /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -lshogun -Wl,-rapth /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -o shogun-test shogun-test.cpp
@HeikoS	and my ld library path is empty
@besser82	g++  -I /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/src/:/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/third_party -L /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -lshogun -Wl,-rpath /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -o shogun-test shogun-test.cpp
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	I mean, it is inly the UNREF undefined references in my case
@HeikoS	all other references are found
@HeikoS	so the path and the setup must be correct
@HeikoS	only the UNREF call is missing in the .so file somehow
@HeikoS	besser82: weird
@HeikoS	I dont really understand how that can be
@HeikoS	am I forgetting a library?
@besser82	HeikoS, me neither...  none, that _I know of...
@HeikoS	how can I see the command that is executed from cmake?
@HeikoS	because this works
@HeikoS	for compiling the examples
@besser82	Wait...  I can look it up
@HeikoS	thanks
@besser82	g++  -I /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/src/:/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/third_party -L /home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -rdynamic -lshogun -Wl,-rpath,/home/heiko/git/shogun/shogun_develop/shogun/build/src/shogun/ -o shogun-test shogun-test.cpp
@besser82	HeikoS, ^ it adds rdynamic
@HeikoS	besser82:  it still give s the error :(
@HeikoS	in the form you pasted all references are undefined, but if I change the order, the two are still undefined
@HeikoS	wtf
@HeikoS	can I tell cmake somehow to output its commands?
@HeikoS	so that I see the exact g++ command that it executes?
@HeikoS	cmake . make VERBOSE=1
@HeikoS	besser82: mmh
@HeikoS	the command that is executed by cmake, adjusted to my example, also fails
@HeikoS	but when cmake runs it
@HeikoS	it works
@HeikoS	puzzled......
@besser82	HeikoS, me, too...  :S

@besser82	HeikoS, I'm puzzeled too...  No idea
@HeikoS	besser82: what happens if you compile examples?
@besser82	Lemme try...
@HeikoS	I got the same error when I manually try to compile
@HeikoS	so cmake must change something else that the g++ command
@HeikoS	since that does not work either
@besser82	HeikoS, manually compiling works fine for me here
@HeikoS	command?
@besser82	g++ -std=c++11 -I /usr/include/shogun-4.0.1/ -I /usr/include/eigen3/ -lshogun classifier_bagging_liblinear.cpp -o test
@HeikoS	weird
@HeikoS	does make install do something to the so file?
@HeikoS	since I haven't called make install
@HeikoS	but use the dir straigt
@HeikoS	but no
@HeikoS	cmake also does that
@besser82	there is nothing altered by make install, afaik
@HeikoS	besser82: only thing I see is if USE_REFERENCE_COUNTING was false
@HeikoS	then preprocessor ignores the unref
@HeikoS	but it is ON

 besser82_	HeikoS, PR is opened?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: abend!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jojo
@HeikoS	besser82_: coming
 lisitsyn	already back?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: i've got some question we'd need to resolve
 lisitsyn	apparently we should have generated examples in the build directory
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  not yet
@HeikoS	flying later
 lisitsyn	this seem to be right
 lisitsyn	although
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok?
 lisitsyn	do we need to have it elsewhere?
@HeikoS	if they are copied over in installation
@HeikoS	then ok
 lisitsyn	like in base examples
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	they would be
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: is that really important?
 lisitsyn	depends :)
 lisitsyn	anyway as I've got them in the build dir
 lisitsyn	it would be easier to get them when generating sphinx
@HeikoS	ok then
@HeikoS	fine with me
 lisitsyn	okie
@HeikoS	besser82_: PR sent
 besser82_	HeikoS, will review it in short
@HeikoS	besser82_: feel free to merge it and close the old one
@HeikoS	I will go to airplane soon
 besser82_	HeikoS, have nice flight!  =)
 besser82_	HeikoS, going to Deutschland?
@HeikoS	besser82_: yes
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	sry
@HeikoS	London
 besser82_	HeikoS, no x-mas @ home this year?
@HeikoS	besser82_: London is my home
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: when will the patch be ready? :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you mean whole pr?
 lisitsyn	working atm
@HeikoS	yeah the docs
@HeikoS	I want to get my hands on this soon
@HeikoS	so even if not 100% complete, at least push it to the feature branch
 lisitsyn	it is already
@HeikoS	then I can have a look and think how to structure the pages more etc
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah is it sent?
 lisitsyn	I think mostly yes
 lisitsyn	I don't have any changes yet
 lisitsyn	I will push some parameters forwarding for our sgexample extension
 lisitsyn	then it should work
 besser82_	HeikoS, I thought Cologne was?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes cool
@HeikoS	besser82_: I grew up there but it is not my home anymore
 besser82_	HeikoS, Ok, I see
