 abinash_panda	hey thoralf !
 thoralf	Hey abinash_panda
 abinash_panda	I have some doubts regarding the hashing of sparse vector.
 abinash_panda	I went through the paper  K. Weinberger, et.al. Feature Hashing for Large Scale Multitask Learning
 abinash_panda	and have some confusion regarding the hashing
 abinash_panda	I had sent you a mail regarding it ;)
 thoralf	I know - but I don't understand what's the difference between both formulas.
 thoralf	Ah, I see.
 thoralf	No, the formula is correct.
 thoralf	You want wo sum over all indices, which are hashed to the same value.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay. Thats what I am saying that we should sum over all the x[j] j:h(j) == i
 abinash_panda	instead of x[i] j:h(j) == i
 thoralf	\xi(j) x_j
 abinash_panda	or \xi(i) x_j ??
 thoralf	I see your point.  It's a typo in the paper.
 thoralf	We have two hashing functions over (j).
 thoralf	One is hashing the feature indices, the other is "toggling" the prefix of the summed value.
 abinash_panda	Okay. I got it.
 thoralf	alex.smola.org/papers/2009/Weinbergeretal09.pdf
 thoralf	They fixed it in this paper.
 abinash_panda	So, with this I had modified my hash_vector() method and the results are
 abinash_panda	[0.0 sec] created random sparse vector: 262144 features, 268435456 dimensions, [min;max;len]=[440;268435454;261995]
 thoralf	But I found out that your version is slower.
 abinash_panda	[10.7 sec] tklein23 implementation -- 24.0
 abinash_panda	[3.2 sec] abinash implementation -- 79.8
 thoralf	You need to create "sparse" hashed vectors.
 thoralf	uint32_t hash_dim  = 1 << 18
 thoralf	int32_t num_features = 1 << 12
 thoralf	Both parameters were switched, thus creating *dense* vectors.
 thoralf	Your implementation always creates a *dense* vector as intermediate vector.
 thoralf	It has to be allocated, zero()ed, assigned and then iterated over.
 thoralf	And if the hash space is big enough, this can be expensive.

 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hey
 abinash_panda	Yeah, I have seen it.
 thoralf	Master!
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: gonna glance over your pr just now
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hah
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, thanks! take your time
 abinash_panda	thoralf: One minor modification required in your code:
 abinash_panda	[0.0 sec] created random sparse vector: 262144 features, 268435456 dimensions, [min;max;len]=[440;268435454;261995]
 abinash_panda	[10.7 sec] tklein23 implementation -- 24.0
 abinash_panda	dst.features[j].entry += (mm3 % 2 == 1 ? -1.0 : 1.0) * src.features[j].entry;
 abinash_panda	thoralf: dst.features[j].entry += (mm3 % 2 == 1 ? -1.0 : 1.0) * src.features[j].entry;
 lisitsyn	yikes! 268435456 dimensions ;)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: :D
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I don't see the improvement.
 thoralf	+=
 thoralf	Damn!
 thoralf	Yes
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: as usual no comments :D

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Implemented Restricted Boltzmann Machines
 thoralf	abinash_panda: No!
 thoralf	:D
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I'm only collecting the values.
 lisitsyn	it is boring you write that good code :P
 thoralf	abinash_panda: The summing happens magically when sort_features()
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, haha :D
 thoralf	abinash_panda: If a sparse vector has duplicate entries, they will be summed after sorting.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay. I was not knowing it. Cool feature ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay. So, I am going with your implementation of hash_vector() :)
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Well, we have to take care that sparse vectors indices are sorted and not duplicate.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Otherwise strange[tm] things will happen.
 abinash_panda	Yeah...BTW I liked the *strange[tm]* comment :D
 thoralf	:D
 abinash_panda	thoralf: One more thing, if we are going to deal only with SGSparseVector, so should I put a check on features being CSparseFeatures ?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Good question.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yes, please check it.
 abinash_panda	Yeah...then we should also go for CHashedSparseMultilabelModel to avoid confusion ;)
* thoralf hates these long names.
 thoralf	:D
 shogun-buildbot	build #2373 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2373  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, khalednasr <k.nasr92@gmail.com>
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Fine. Then I am going with CHashedMultilabelModel :D
 thoralf	Other thing is that we add alternate implemation for hash_vector() and put a SGNOTIMPLEMENTED inside.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Haha, cool.
 thoralf	You know how to make people happy ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: another implementation for hash_vector()??
 abinash_panda	thoralf: is this for dense vectors??
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Not yes, just a bold idea.
 thoralf	sth like hash_vector(SGVector) and hash_vector(SGSparseVector).
 thoralf	But don't care about this yet.  I don't see a sense in using *dense* vectors with this approach.
 thoralf	This will eat up your memory, your family and your whole life.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: lol :D
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Have you tried the benchmark with hash_dim  = 1 << 18 and num_features = 1 << 12 ?
 abinash_panda	Yeah, I had tried. Found that your implementation is faster ;)
 thoralf	Okay.
 thoralf	Difference will grow with increaing hash_dim.
 thoralf	1 << 20 is devastating
 abinash_panda	Oh. No, I have not tried yet.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Another doubt regarding get_joint_feature_vector() method?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Do you have doubts or are you asking me?
 abinash_panda	As you have mentioned in the comment that it should be a sparse vector right?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yes.
-!- pickle27 [~pickle27@192-0-136-118.cpe.teksavvy.com] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	abinash_panda: My local code already uses sparse vectors for this, but it's hard to isolate...
 abinash_panda	thoralf: But the CStructuredModel class requires that the output of this should be SGVector instead.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I know.  Let me check something.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Furthermore, solvers like PrimalMosekSOSVM and StochasticSOSVM also require ret->psi_pred and ret->psi_truth
 thoralf	abinash_panda: In my refactoring I completely removed psi_pred and psi_truth from result set.
 abinash_panda	Okay.
 thoralf	Instead I put get_joint_feature_vector calls directly in the machines.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah...we can do that
 thoralf	abinash_panda: We should.
 thoralf	Otherwise we'll get into trouble with our approach.
 thoralf	Can you make it a separate PR and send it before the current one?
 abinash_panda	Yeah..sure.
 thoralf	iirc this is only small refactoring - but I don't remember if I had to fix unit tests as well.
 abinash_panda	Once you were talking of some good git tutorial. Could you please send me the link?
 abinash_panda	I had messed up with my local repo
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Mail sent.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: It's a paid one, so please don't spread it too far.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Okay. I would take care of that.
 abinash_panda	Thanks :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: So, tomorrow I would sending the PR refactoring the solvers :)
 thoralf	The machines, right?
 thoralf	Not the solvers
 thoralf	I grepped for psi_truth/psi_pred and found a few machines.
 abinash_panda	Yeah..the machines.
 thoralf	So first refactoring is simply removing psi_pred/truth from ResultSet and calling psi() inside the machines.
 abinash_panda	Yeah...it would be a simple task. I would do it.
 abinash_panda	and then we can discuss on the get_joint_feature_vector()
 thoralf	Yes.
 abinash_panda	we can overload get_joint_feature_vector() method for returning SGSparseVector..right?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Not sure if we can have same signature but different return values.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Master?
 lisitsyn	thoralf: ahh stop it :D
 thoralf	:D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: X function(Y) can't have a Z function() implementation, right?
 thoralf	X function(Y)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: it has some intrinsic irony and I feel I don't deserve being msc :D
 thoralf	Z function(Y)
 lisitsyn	ehhm
 lisitsyn	ah covariant types?
 lisitsyn	or?
 thoralf	Don't know what covariant types are. :D
 lisitsyn	ok in java you can
 lisitsyn	Z extends X
 lisitsyn	then
 thoralf	No
 lisitsyn	totally different types?
 thoralf	Z extends A and X extends A
 thoralf	A = SGObject ;)
 thoralf	so totally different
* thoralf cannot imaging how dispatching to the right function should work. ;)
 lisitsyn	how can it dispatch what function to call? ;)
 lisitsyn	well
 thoralf	imagine
 thoralf	Haha, thanks.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Let's say we can't - but let's discuss that tmrw
 lisitsyn	in C++ you can
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Really?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Fine :)
 lisitsyn	yeah with default argument
 lisitsyn	it looks like
 lisitsyn	X function(Y, somedefault thing)
 lisitsyn	Z function(Y, some default thing)
 lisitsyn	the trick is you need to FAIL one default thing
 lisitsyn	so it has no other choice
 thoralf	And how do I fail?
 lisitsyn	hmm accessing some member of class
 lisitsyn	I mean if you ask for
 lisitsyn	A::T
 lisitsyn	and there is no T
 lisitsyn	in A
 lisitsyn	it fails
 lisitsyn	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/SFINAE
 lisitsyn	ok this describes better
 thoralf	Ah!  function templates
 thoralf	Of course.
 thoralf	Not overloading, but templates.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yeah sure
 thoralf	lisitsyn: In shogun we're using everything. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: but in normal languages there is no such crazy thing as overloaded return type functions
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Are you calling C++ crazy? ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: absolutely
 thoralf	Agree :)
 thoralf	C++ is kind of a job guarantee. :)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: though java sucks
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	(Java is no job guarantee itself; you need to add JavaEE or Hadoop to make it unpredictable ;))
 lisitsyn	thoralf: on the other hand java is too verbose and is no better
 lisitsyn	hmm here I had a lot opportunities with java
 lisitsyn	but no opportunities with C++ at all
 thoralf	opportunities?
 thoralf	Talking seriously or ironic?
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	no, I am quite serious
 thoralf	opportunities always sounds like "issues" ;)
 lisitsyn	when I wanted to change my job
 lisitsyn	I had no C++ thing around
@wiking	lisitsyn: so yeah i'm moving to .sg
 thoralf	Yeah, but Java itself is easy to learn.  That's why all the companies are using Java, because developers are easier to find.
 lisitsyn	wiking: sg!
 thoralf	C++ is hard to learn, so less people learn it :)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yeah monkey can code java
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	wiking: Cool.
 thoralf	wiking: Don't do anything wrong - they may put you in chains and whip you. ;)
 lisitsyn	wiking: how do you feel about it? ;)
@wiking	thoralf: hhahhahah
@wiking	lisitsyn: well a bit ambivalent
@wiking	but it's ok i always wanted to live in asia
@wiking	so we'll see
 lisitsyn	shogunees move around the world
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	yaa!
 thoralf	wiking: Wish you good luck.
@wiking	but yeah after the move
 lisitsyn	wiking: when do you move?
@wiking	i'll be back in working on shogun
@wiking	lisitsyn: hehehehe i thought it's going to be 1st of august
 thoralf	wiking:)
 lisitsyn	wiking: cool we are moving at the same time hah
@wiking	but now my wife checked an email and suddenly it seems we have to go on the 9th of july
@wiking	:)))
 lisitsyn	ah
@wiking	so suddenly it's like getting tickets
 pickle27	wiking: where are you moving to?
@wiking	pickle27: singapore
 pickle27	ahh cool
 pickle27	I know some guys who have worked there
 pickle27	they really like it
@wiking	ok i need job
@wiking	:)
@wiking	so anybody knows anything in singapore
@wiking	plz let me know
@wiking	as currently i dont get to work in singapore (visa problems)
@wiking	so i need an employer who would apply for me for a working visa :P

 thoralf	pickle27: Canada is great. :)
 lisitsyn	gonna try it first
@wiking	other than that i code for food :P
 thoralf	pickle27: I had to cancel my canada vacation this week ;(
 thoralf	pickle27: Shopify is looking for ML engineers?
 pickle27	oh no! thoralf where were you visiting in canada?
 thoralf	pickle27: I like Canada so much and I booked a flight to Boston for last week, then going to Toronto and Montreal this week, New England next week.
 thoralf	So the plan.
 thoralf	But I had to cancel a day before because my gf had a bicycle accident.
 lisitsyn	oh is it ok?
 thoralf	She's okay-ish now.
 pickle27	that sucks hope she's alright
 thoralf	Yeah, but this happened the day before the flight, so the doctors said not to fly.
 thoralf	But I love canada. :D
 lisitsyn	this sucks
 thoralf	pickle27: Where are you living?
 pickle27	we're hiring all kinds of engineers btw we are growing too fast
 pickle27	Im in Ottawa now
 pickle27	as in we can't hire people fast enough!
 thoralf	pickle27: Okay, probably we're traveling to Canada this autumn.  Same tour.  Indian summer.  We'll let you know... you can even join, as we probably will rent a car and travel around. :D
 thoralf	Boston -> Amherst -> Toronto -> ... -> Montreal -> Boston
 pickle27	yeah totally let me know! it would be fun to meet some of you guys in rl
 thoralf	Will you come to Berlin for the workshop?
 thoralf	Just to let you know... I can host some of you guys here.
 pickle27	I was thinking about it but I haven't planned anything so probably not
 lisitsyn	thoralf: ha! this would be cool
 thoralf	So no hotel needed, if this may change your decision.
 lisitsyn	but I am still unavailable
 thoralf	Only have a sparse sofa, but enough floor space for a lot of nerds. :D
 lisitsyn	gonna rush through moscow in search of a flat exactly these days
 lisitsyn	thoralf: tell me sth about winter berlin
 lisitsyn	it is cool during winter?
 lisitsyn	is it* :D
 lisitsyn	cool not temperature wise but any other kind of coolness
 thoralf	lisitsyn: I'm living here... so you shouldn't ask me.
 thoralf	I don't know all this tourist stuff.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: hah
 thoralf	Waking up, going to work, going back.
 thoralf	Spending my holiday in != Berlin ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: are there any sales before xmas or whatever?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Of course, everywhere.
 lisitsyn	this is deffs not I am interesting in but you know I have gf
 lisitsyn	:D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Before christmas there are some traditional markets.
 thoralf	In Berlin, Leipzig, N?rnberg...
 thoralf	hot spiced wine
 thoralf	:D
 lisitsyn	we call it some german word
 thoralf	or wine punch - however this is called.
 thoralf	Gl?hwein
 lisitsyn	glintwine?
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: okay I see :)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: this is something funny
 lisitsyn	you see you're living in kind of center of something
 lisitsyn	at least more things are going on there
 lisitsyn	someone is living in NYC and feel the same - wake up / work / sleep
 thoralf	lisitsyn: I'm living next to Tegel Airport and Main station.
 lisitsyn	what's main station?
 thoralf	Hauptbahnhof.
 thoralf	Train.
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	cool place
 thoralf	Yeah.
 lisitsyn	the only place we managed to buy things in
 thoralf	Cool place for good transport experience when hosting guests. :D
 lisitsyn	because I was stupid enough to not think people could ever not work during sundays
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	pickle27, lisitsyn: I'll host all of you guys. :)
 lisitsyn	why? :D
 pickle27	I really do want to visit Berlin!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ask me about tourist things haha ;)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: You don't have to. :D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: wait wait I feel cheated :D
 lisitsyn	how come you live near tegel
 lisitsyn	and hauptbahnhof
 lisitsyn	at the same time
 lisitsyn	aren't they far away?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: maps.google.com -> berlin beusselstr
 lisitsyn	thoralf: tegel is terribly far away! :D
 thoralf	Or compute directions: Hauptbahnhof -> Beusselstr -> Tegel
 thoralf	lisitsyn: It's 5-10 minutes by Bus.
 thoralf	5 by car
 lisitsyn	thoralf: alright ;)
 thoralf	And the bus between Hauptbahnhof and Tegel stops (almost) in front of my house. :D
 lisitsyn	thoralf: this moabit thing seemed to be quiet area
 lisitsyn	is it true?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: It's getting popular because of last cheap flats near city center.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: We have lot of students here, but (not yet) many caf?s and bars.
 thoralf	But I think they're developing.
 thoralf	But it's more living area for working people, but already nice enough for hipster coming here on the weekends.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: ah btw I have opposite offer - I could host you in moscow from august ;)
 lisitsyn	and well any of you ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: you haven't been there right?
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Honestly I'm a concerned about Russia.  About war with Ukraine.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Never.
 thoralf	Never been there.
 lisitsyn	how concerned?
 thoralf	I don't know.  First of all, reputation of Russia is not quite good over here.
 lisitsyn	heh well
 thoralf	Regaring police and foreign affairs.
 thoralf	Regarding
 lisitsyn	thoralf: it is actually like not something to worry about :D
 lisitsyn	I mean the best solution is to don't bother with that stuff at all
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Well, I guess it doesn't affect tourists at all.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Btw., before xmas the whole city is illuminated. ;)
 thoralf	(Not what you think :D)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: haha
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I wish this ukraine madness stopped but nobody wants to stop it
 lisitsyn	thoralf: EU and the US put some sanctions but they are really insignificant
 lisitsyn	so this is a big game
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Everybody wants to stop it, but some people see big opportunities there...
 lisitsyn	thoralf: well not everybody but all but people who control
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	it's getting funny because our presidents does whatever he wants and EU has no real power to push him back
 lisitsyn	president*
 lisitsyn	no real power or no real will
 lisitsyn	I am quite sure $-wise it is quite easy to put some costs on russia but it is not the case for some reason
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Everybody here is surprised as well why we can't do anything about it.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Maybe they thing about "markets" - Russia simply is a big market and Germany lives of exports.
 thoralf	And everybody else is concerned about gas?
 thoralf	Only guessing.
 lisitsyn	well gas is the thing, yeah
 lisitsyn	it should be like 20% of gas import in the EU
 lisitsyn	that comes from russia
 lisitsyn	thoralf: the most important thing is that russian elite is heavily attached to the EU
 lisitsyn	they live there, their children live there
 lisitsyn	so this is pure fake
 thoralf	They have estates in Berlin, while local elite hast estates in Moscow :D
 thoralf	Just conspiracy, no proof.
