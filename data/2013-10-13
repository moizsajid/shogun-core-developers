@iglesiasg	sonney2k, ping?
 van51	hey iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	hi van51
 van51	iglesiasg: do you know anything about where the web demos will be hosted and/or when?
@iglesiasg	van51, no sorry, no idea
 van51	iglesiasg: there is a data mining course starting here in my uni and I know the TA and I was thinking of asking them to show some algorithms from shogun
@iglesiasg	van51, that is an awesome idea
 van51	I remember us viewing kmeans for instance from a java applet
@iglesiasg	van51, so what do you think it is the state of the demos?
@iglesiasg	van51, I poked a bit around the ones in the PR you just sent
 van51	iglesiasg: most of them are pretty good
 van51	iglesiasg: I don't like the toy generator when there are more than 1 classes
@iglesiasg	van51, I found some glitches though :S
@iglesiasg	van51, that was one of them
 van51	iglesiasg: what else?
@iglesiasg	van51, in KMeans the circunferences are pretty weird
@iglesiasg	van51, they become way too large
@iglesiasg	I just tried a couple of examples
 van51	iglesiasg: yeah indeed
@iglesiasg	and in KMeans also
@iglesiasg	if you click with the right button
@iglesiasg	it creates points of another class
@iglesiasg	that shouldn't be allowed here I guess

@iglesiasg	ups.. wrong hotkey and close the chat window heh
 van51	iglesiasg: so about the radius it comes down to what is calculated in the KMeans class as radius
 van51	iglesiasg: and the code mentions something about variance and not radius
@iglesiasg	van51, mm I see
 van51	iglesiasg: so we may have to calculate the max distance from the points and draw that
@iglesiasg	van51, but hold on a second
@iglesiasg	van51, I used that KMeans not so long ago for my thesis
@iglesiasg	and the circunferences were fine IIRC
@iglesiasg	let me double check
@iglesiasg	in case I was using another method
@iglesiasg	nope
@iglesiasg	kMeans indeed
 van51	iglesiasg: get_radius()?
@iglesiasg	let me check the code
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	get_radiuses
@iglesiasg	van51,  https://github.com/iglesias/linal/blob/master/graphical/cluster_kmeans.py
@iglesiasg	van51, the figure generated in on page 4 here https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11020840/pfc/fjig_pfc.pdf
 van51	iglesiasg: hmm I see
 van51	iglesiasg: I will have another look then
 van51	iglesiasg: could be I overlooked something
 van51	iglesiasg: thx for showing me that
@iglesiasg	van51, hehe no problem
@iglesiasg	I make publicity of the things I do this way :P
 van51	iglesiasg: hah true ;)
 van51	iglesiasg: as for the secondary class, it plays no role idd, butI think the label coloring may good for demonstration purposes
 van51	may be*
@iglesiasg	van51, but, how are the blue points used in the clustering demo?
 van51	iglesiasg: they are all treated the same way
@iglesiasg	van51, are they ignored? are they considered to be of the same class as the red ones?
 van51	iglesiasg: the latter
@iglesiasg	van51, I see
 van51	iglesiasg: from what I see in the demo code, it parses the labels but never passes them to the kmeans object
@iglesiasg	van51, I see
 van51	as expected thatis
@iglesiasg	also
@iglesiasg	van51, what about the toy data in the classification demos?
@iglesiasg	van51, because the generator only creates examples of one class, right?
 van51	iglesiasg: yeah
 van51	iglesiasg: I was thinking of extending it to allow assigning more than 1 labels
 van51	iglesiasg: but maybe it needs a new toy generator so that the classes are pretty much seperated
@iglesiasg	van51, aham
@iglesiasg	van51, what do you think is best to do then?
@iglesiasg	van51, I don't think it is a good idea to keep the generator that just generates one-class data for classification demos
 van51	iglesiasg: yeah I agree. I also prefer the second approach
 lisitsyn	hello guyz
 van51	lisitsyn: hey
 van51	iglesiasg: I'll finish with the descriptions and start after that on a new generator
 lisitsyn	who's got time? ;)
 van51	iglesiasg: if you spot anything else let me know :)
@iglesiasg	van51, ok, that sounds great
 van51	lisitsyn: me if I can help

 lisitsyn	van51: okay let me check what can you help us with
 van51	lisitsyn: ah, if it's not urgent then I'll start something else after the demos
 lisitsyn	van51: argh - I don't know
 lisitsyn	please check https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?direction=desc&milestone=3&sort=updated&state=open and see if you can resolve any of these
 lisitsyn	there are a lot of infrastructure issues unfortunately
 lisitsyn	like cmake etc
 van51	lisitsyn: not sure how much I can help with cmake, but I will have a look later or tonight
 lisitsyn	van51: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1548 may be this one?
 van51	lisitsyn: yeah that sound better

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hey
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hi
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, writing a mail to you about it right now...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sent!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well links on the info page are broken for many refs - you could correct them though with proper ones pointing to the refernces page
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, ok, but it is not just the links
@iglesiasg	I mean
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, [1] in info page
@iglesiasg	does not reference to [1] in the reference pages I think
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, do you see what I mean?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, and still, even if they were correct, I'd rather see the references after the description in the info page too
@iglesiasg	I don't see the point of having this References page honestly
