 sonne|work	besser82: is fedora using /bin/bash as $SHELL?
 sonne|work	or dash like the others?
 besser82	sonne|work:  /bin/sh --->  /bin/bash  like ALL rpm-based distros  ;)
 sonne|work	yeah... rpmbuild is full of bashisms and of course fails creating rpms when /bin/sh is dash
 besser82	sonne|work:  yes, rpm* heavily depends on having bash  as default sh
 besser82	sonne|work:  looks like a bug in debian then....
 sonne|work	why debian? shouldn't rpmbuild call /bin/bash ?
 besser82	sonne|work:  that depends on the options it was configured during build....
 besser82	sonne|work:  on fedora it is configured using /bin/bash as shell
 besser82	sonne|work:  on debian it uses /bin/sh  ;)
 sonne|work	ahh ok
@wiking	besser82: /usr/bin/env bash
@wiking	besser82: as that's really only for linux systems
@wiking	 /bin/bash and alike
@wiking	 /usr/bin/env bash should be consistent regardless of a distro
 besser82	wiking:  ???
@wiking	besser82: /bin/bash -> /usr/bin/env bash
 besser82	wiking:  using /usr/bin/env might be somewhat problematic, I'm afraid
@wiking	seriously?
@wiking	on what distro?
 besser82	wiking:  at least by means of rpmbuild
 besser82	wiking:  basically all
@wiking	so fedora just doesn't support /usr/bin/env bash or what?
 besser82	wiking:  on fedora there are guidelines for NOT using /usr/bin/env in hashbang and all
@wiking	mmm interesting
@wiking	so in fedora it's a guideline to not to be portable?
 besser82	wiking:  No, but since /usr/bin/env spawns a new shell  with copying the env instead of using profile.d defaults  ;)
@wiking	well actually yes
 besser82	wiking:  so the resulting env might not be prestine and can cause problems  ;)
@wiking	if it's a guideline not to go with /usr/bin/env
@wiking	then it actually implies that that shell script will not be portable
 besser82	wiking:  portable by means of?
@wiking	besser82: to be used on any distro where /bin/bash does not exist
 besser82	wiking:  basically any distro I know has the shells in /bin
@wiking	besser82: sh and csh
@wiking	besser82: but not bash
@wiking	maybe tcsh as well
 besser82	wiking:  who ships bash in /usr/bin?
@wiking	besser82: you would be amazed
@wiking	besser82: even /usr/local/bin
@wiking	besser82: bash is by far not a widespread shell
@wiking	only linux distros has it
@wiking	but not even all of it
@wiking	as default
 besser82	wiking:  yes, but why should be a rpm for fedora be portable to let's say netBSD?!?
@wiking	so this guideline is purely about rpm generation?
 besser82	wiking:  there is /usr/bin/env on fedora, too;  But when packagaging software in rpm one is required to change the hashbang from /usr/bin/env to the interpreter bin directly  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  yes
@wiking	mea culpa
 besser82	wiking:  np  ;)
 besser82	wiking:  still look for a job?
 besser82	wiking:  you're on SF Bay, right?
 besser82	wiking:  http://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/10217150
@wiking	heheh no
@wiking	but thnx
 besser82	wiking:  :D
 besser82	wiking:  no, job or not SF bay?
@wiking	not looking for a job atm
@wiking	or let's say i'm not looking for it that intensively
@wiking	maybe if i really like something then
@wiking	but thnx anyways

 besser82	lambday:  Every serious fedora-user has one  ;)
 lambday	besser82: ...then I guess I am not that serious.. I thought I was :(
 besser82	lambday:  was more some fun  about that serious
 besser82	lambday:  in fact the contributors sign up there ;)
 besser82	lambday:  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/
 lambday	besser82: yeah checking that
 besser82	lambday:  If want to help me maintaining shogun on Fedora, lemme know  ;)
 lambday	besser82: yeah! but I know little about fedora specific things though - you'll have to teach me!
 besser82	lambday:  that wouldn't be the problem  ;)
 lambday	great!
 lambday	currently I am not that occupied... so if there's something I can help with.. let me know
 besser82	lambday:  currently not much...
 besser82	lambday:  except if you want to bring some new stuff into fedora
 lambday	besser82: I will be around.. hope I can be of some help!
 lambday	besser82: new stuffs as in?
 lambday	shogun specific?
 besser82	lambday:  like some nifty libs || apps
 besser82	lambday:  if you want  ;)
 besser82	lambday:  shogun specific as well, like fixing build of java-modular  for fedora
 lambday	besser82: it doesn't work??
 lambday	besser82: I used java-modular on fedora
 besser82	lambday:  unfortunately no  :(
 lambday	well, it was a year back!
 besser82	lambday:  hehe
 besser82	lambday:  since with cmake it doesn't....
 lambday	weird
 lambday	checking
 lambday	besser82: I am using f19 and I don't like it btw!
 besser82	lambday:  ugrade to F20  ;)
 besser82	lambday:  It is much better
 besser82	lambday:  I actually used F19 for just 4 weeks after released and switched to f20 then
 lambday	besser82: ahan!
 besser82	lambday:  F20 in pre-alpha was even better than F19  ;)
 lambday	besser82: so yum upgrade should work or I should download the iso and?
 besser82	lambday:  use `fedup`  ;)
 besser82	lambday:  yum install fedup
 besser82	lambday:  fedup --network 20
 lambday	wow!! :D loving the name....
 besser82	reboot
 lambday	okie
 besser82	lambday:  then just reboot and wait for fedup to finish  ;)
 lambday	besser82: alrighty... running..
 besser82	lambday:  +1  :D
 lambday	besser82: I am behind proxy... should I configure fedup first or it can use env vars $http_proxy etc?
 lambday	nevermind... its running it seems :D
 besser82	lambday:  It doesn't need network after reboot  ;)
 besser82	lambday:  just for preping the sys
 besser82	lambday:  and AFAIK it uses the proxies from NetworkManager ;)
 lambday	cool!
 lambday	ready to go then!
 besser82	lambday:  kk
 besser82	lambday:  after reboot the upgrade might take ~20 mins
 lambday	besser82: alright.. can't wait to try it out!
 besser82	lambday:  then go go goooooo !  :D
 lambday	downloading 300~ out of 2036!

 gsomix_	iglesiasg, happy ny!
 lambday	lisitsyn: great! :) got a job placement.. project stage 1 is over..
 lambday	besser82: checking... chrome may be
 lisitsyn	lambday: yeah I have seen you are an oracle guy now :)
 lambday	rpmfusions
 lambday	lisitsyn: not quite yet... don't wanna be :(
 besser82	lambday:  chrome from Spot's repo?!?
 lisitsyn	lambday: why?
 lambday	besser82: have these in my /etc/yum.repos.d/... adobe-linux, google-chrome, and rpmfusions apart from fedora repos
 besser82	lambday:  fedup --network 20 --disable-repo=adobe* --disable-repo=google*
 lambday	lisitsyn: job profile has nothing to do with ML... but probably will learn other things..
 lambday	besser82: cool! trying.. rpmfusions are okay then?
 besser82	lambday:  yes, rpmfusion should be ok
 besser82	lambday:  otherwise just append another disable-repo
 lambday	alrighty
 besser82	lambday:  and then you need to `yum distro-sync`  after upgrade has finished !!!!  IMPORTANT!!!
 lambday	disable-repo not recognized with 0.8
 lambday	okay!
 lambday	lisitsyn: hey I was just checking out the multitask learning tutorial you wrote... do you know any good materials for the backgrounds?
 lisitsyn	lambday: not really but I am trying to write a notebook now :)
 lambday	I was checking out a video tutorial which was going above my head
 lambday	lisitsyn: for the same?
 lambday	great! :)
 lambday	besser82: disable-repo not recognized with 0.8.. should I manually disable them and rerun fedup?
 besser82	lambday:  remove da dash `-` between disable-repo
 besser82	lambday:  that works  ;)
 lambday	yeah! it does :D

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, going to try with apply_structured right away
-!- tricksy_ [uid12458@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-nlwmaztxbmvaxxha] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, mmm something really funny going on
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, with apply_structured in the one step setup it does not seem to finish
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, with apply in one step it crashes right away
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, with two steps using apply it works fast and without any problem
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, found it more or less
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, SWIG code?
@sonney2k	I understand the problem but no idea what the solution is
@sonney2k	I cooked everything down to very few lines
@sonney2k	basically
@sonney2k	when doing apply
@sonney2k	or apply_structured
@sonney2k	(doesn't matter)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, the returned refcount is 1
@sonney2k	which is what we would expect
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw you can call obj.ref_count() to see its current refcount
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, now when you do to_structured()
@sonney2k	the refcount remains 1
@sonney2k	which is what we would expect from C++
@sonney2k	but not from swig
@iglesiasg	iglesiasg, why not?
@iglesiasg	fuck...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, ^
@iglesiasg	talking to me again
@sonney2k	because swig will put the object into to_structured
@sonney2k	realize upon return that the bmrm.apply() is no longer needed
@sonney2k	and unref it
@sonney2k	and so we loose
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so when you split up the call into 2
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, you still have one reference hanging around
@sonney2k	and python cannot free the object
@sonney2k	however if you would do del lab
@sonney2k	where lab = bmrm.apply()
@sonney2k	after you do to_structured(lab)
@sonney2k	and then get the refcount
@sonney2k	you will see the same issue
@iglesiasg	I get it I think
@sonney2k	I don't see a solution currently :/
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if we would return the label object within c++ with refcount 1 already
@sonney2k	swig would inc it to refcount 2
@sonney2k	and so we would have a leak
@sonney2k	so we somehow need swig to inc the refcount in the to_structured ...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but I don't think it makes sense to ref() inside to_structured or?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, can we do that in .i?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, no, I don't think it is right to ref inside to_structured
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am just reading http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#Customization_ownership
@sonney2k	maybe %newobject can help...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes that seems to be good
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, The %newobject feature is designed to indicate to the target language that it should take ownership of the returned object. When used in conjunction with a type that has the "ref" feature associated with it, it additionally emits the code in the "ref" feature into the C++ wrapper. Consider wrapping the following factory function in addition to the above:
-!- anshul [uid12132@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-upvmkyzixkzpxewj] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so %newobject to_structured() should fix it
@sonney2k	it is confusing though since this is not a new object but just a cast'd one
-!- anshul_ [uid12132@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-lxnlivptjtoejbvo] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, however to_structured is not even needed because apply() already returns CStructuredLabels
