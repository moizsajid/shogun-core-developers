@iglesiasg	wiking, sonney2k, hey guys, a question about the notebooks and the webpage
@iglesiasg	so if I update one of the notebooks shown in http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook
@iglesiasg	as I have done with the abstract of one of the ICA notebooks
-!- pickle271 [~kevin@24-212-221-132.cable.teksavvy.com] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	what needs to be done so that it gets updated in the website?
@iglesiasg	pickle271, hey there! How are you doing?
 pickle271	good man!
 pickle271	just finished moving to Ottawa Canada
 pickle271	got internet setup in my new apt this morning
 pickle271	starting work tomorrow!
@iglesiasg	pickle271, started the new job already?
@iglesiasg	nice then!
@iglesiasg	pickle271, btw, I did a tiny mod in one of your notebooks
@iglesiasg	pickle271, see here http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook
@iglesiasg	the BSS audio one had a little bit long abstract to be shown in the website
@iglesiasg	so I have basically divided that markdown cell into two cells
@iglesiasg	pickle271, hope there is no problem for you with that!
 pickle271	ahh cool
 pickle271	looks good!
@iglesiasg	all right
@iglesiasg	no idea when it will get updated in the website though
@iglesiasg	with any luck it will happen after the nightly build
 pickle271	yeah the release looks good!
 pickle271	I hope to have time to do some shogun stuff in a 2 weeks or so
 pickle271	I have a fun example project in mind!
@iglesiasg	cool
@iglesiasg	what is it about?
 pickle271	still a wip
 pickle271	basically making a basic AI for mario kart using some vision and ml
@iglesiasg	oh, it sounds challenging!
@iglesiasg	so nice :)
 pickle271	yeah i dunno if it will go anywhere I've just been playing around
 pickle271	I have the framework setup
 pickle271	now I need to do the actual machine learning part
@iglesiasg	how is the ml part?
@iglesiasg	I mean, what data to use and what is the objective of the ml module
 pickle271	not totally sure yet, I was actually going to see what people thought was best
 pickle271	I basically have a data set that is the frames of the game and what a user (aka me) was doing on the gamepad at that time
 pickle271	and thats all I have done
 shogun-buildbot	build #273 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/273  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	I see
 shogun-buildbot	build #274 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/274  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 lisitsyn	oh guys never go to computer vision
 lisitsyn	:D
 pickle271	I saw a really old video / paper on NNs that did something similar with a real car
 lisitsyn	stupid amount of time tuning parameters and stuff argh
 pickle271	it only drove like 15 Km per hour though
 pickle271	lisitsyn: haha I know, I kept trying to drift my MASc over to ML
 lisitsyn	pickle271: I am still working on that shit remember?
 pickle271	lisitsyn: yeah I do, man that sucks
 lisitsyn	everything is overdued arght
 lisitsyn	however I resolved most of the issues
 pickle271	lisitsyn: also in CV there is this nagging notion of - should I make this whole alg better or should I add a special case to deal with this particular problem
@iglesiasg	pickle271, yeah, it also reminds me about sth Ng did with an helicopter that could fly upside down
 lisitsyn	pickle271: apparently that shitloader is moving with up to 20 degree angle
 pickle271	iglesiasg: yeah, its deffs been done before
 lisitsyn	so I had to ouhhuh
 pickle271	iglesiasg: but no one has opened up their framework
 lisitsyn	pickle271: for now I am using sobel response to maintain background model :D
 lisitsyn	apparently it is better
 pickle271	iglesiasg: so exposing the problem in terms of input and output is my main goal, not performance
@iglesiasg	pickle271, I see. In any case, it would be something interesting to work on, and really cool results very likely!
 pickle271	lisitsyn: cool, I'm not familiar with that technique in that context
 lisitsyn	pickle271: well just MOG2 from opencv on top of sobel
 lisitsyn	pickle271: somehow it works :D
 pickle271	lisitsyn: that makes some sense actually
 lisitsyn	pickle271: the problem is that it outputs a bunch of points
 lisitsyn	I mean no strong areas
 lisitsyn	so camshift will come mad
 lisitsyn	I just fit a rectangle
 lisitsyn	I am afraid it is not robust enough but trainset works..

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix two tiny typos in BSS image notebook
 pickle271	lisitsyn: thats all you can do
 pickle271	lisitsyn: the trainset I mean
 lisitsyn	pickle271: yeah but trying to keep in mind other cases
 lisitsyn	when e.g. a man walks here
 lisitsyn	no idea how would it work
 pickle271	lisitsyn: I was working on an industry project and they never gave us data, so we had to keep trying to make our own that fit their use case
 pickle271	project crashed and burned
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	pickle271: no these guys gave me a lot of data
 lisitsyn	2.8 gb of videos
 lisitsyn	pickle271: I feel pretty guilty because they consult me when I ask and etc
 lisitsyn	but I still overdue that shit :D
@iglesiasg	all right guys, time to sleep for me
@iglesiasg	see you tomorrow!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: good night!
 pickle271	iglesiasg: night
@iglesiasg	pickle271, good luck with the new job!
 pickle271	iglesiasg: thanks!

 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: JA
 lisitsyn	:)
@iglesiasg	oui then :D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: NEIN :D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: have you seen 'predator' tracker?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, nope
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GhNXHCQGsM
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it learns the appearance of object to support further tracking
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, cool stuff
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: don't know whether it is state of the art still though
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: but the idea is here now
@iglesiasg	I think the fact that it can change from tracking one thing to another so quickly is advanced stuff
@iglesiasg	like he gave the bounding box and started tracking another thing
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah it is pretty much advanced
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: but I like the idea actually
 lisitsyn	when you maintain a model
@iglesiasg	it is open source
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah with crazy amount of matlab code :)
 sonne|osx	as usual
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@82.113.121.187] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 besser82	lisitsyn: shouldn't it be easy to run MatLab-code with Octave?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yes why not
 lisitsyn	besser82: I meant matlab = unreadable :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: Ahh  ;)
 lisitsyn	and like matlab software ~ bad designed software
 besser82	lisitsyn: I have a personal matlab to python compiler  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: btw. Marburg University starts dropping Matlab  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: replacement:  Pyton + Scipy
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's the human way to do science
 besser82	lisitsyn: :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: They actually dropped it because of increasing license-fees :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's ok too, no matter how they come from the dark side :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: XD
 besser82	lisitsyn: Or or like Uncle Wong says:  Da FOSSSSSSSS iz da so mut beeeeedaahhh  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: foss be good
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn: btw. I just engaged an "Applied Physics BSc." for optimizing the SVM^bright algos  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: how?
 besser82	lisitsyn: He's a friend of mine from the Fedora community and I asked him to do the sucking work  :-P
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	besser82: do you want to release it standalone too?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Like "Hey Budyy!  Ya know about SVM^sh*t?  I wanna make a FOSS alternative which is much better, but need someone to look if there's room for optimazation in algos"
 besser82	lisitsyn: Yes
 lisitsyn	besser82: as shared lib?
 besser82	lisitsyn: I actually planned it to be a C++ shlib && cli-tools
 besser82	lisitsyn: with the possibility to dlopen custom-kernels through a factory  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: and possibly some Cython-style Python-module
 lisitsyn	besser82: I actually would like to see shogun using some libs
 lisitsyn	instead of being thaat gigantic
 besser82	lisitsyn: me too  ;)
 lisitsyn	may be liblinear should be 'fixed' that way too
 besser82	lisitsyn: What's the beef with liblinear?
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm maintaining that for FC
 besser82	lisitsyn: and have good connection to upstream  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: well usual liblinear doesn't support that 'coffin' thing
 lisitsyn	i.e. callback dot and add operations
 lisitsyn	they act like it is dense
 besser82	lisitsyn: I see; so it was customized by S?ren, rye?
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	besser82: multiclass was customized by me
 lisitsyn	iirc
 besser82	lisitsyn: Lemme see, if can get a patch set upstream  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: do you know its developers?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Yeah, not in person. but yes
 lisitsyn	besser82: we can prepare a patch and propose
 lisitsyn	I have no idea whether sonne|work proposed it before
 lisitsyn	probably they know about that way
 besser82	lisitsyn: And it shouldn't be much diffcult for me to get it in, with me wearing my "RedHat"  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: if it was shared library I wouldn't mind if we used linking
 lisitsyn	no idea what others think
 lisitsyn	but I believe it is better
 besser82	lisitsyn: liblinear Makefile builds a shlib by default  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: well yeah I mean 'proper' shlib ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: it is not easy to do that with liblinear but possible - in the end you need to boil down all liblinear operations into dot, dense_dot, add_to_dense_vec such stuff
 lisitsyn	which can be used easier
 sonne|work	rather similar to what ocas does
 besser82	lisitsyn: I see.  So heavy API / ABI changes?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: do you think it is better to have multiple shlibs around?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well yeah some changes
 sonne|work	in addition one would need to register print and error functions, malloc/free/calloc functions etc
 lisitsyn	ah yeah
 sonne|work	not easy but surely possible
 besser82	sonne|work, lisitsyn: Who will dooooo it?
 lisitsyn	besser82: actually that's their drawback
 lisitsyn	I mean when you develop a library
 lisitsyn	you should think of providing that callbacks :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am still unavailable but I want to do that some day
 sonne|work	besser82: what is their incentive to provide a framework like this or even to accept patches like this?
 sonne|work	I don't see it happening
 lisitsyn	yeah I am afraid of that too
 lisitsyn	I see it is much easier to just maintain a fork of liblinear
 besser82	sonne|work, lisitsyn: I can possibly get that stuff into SVM^bright as well ;)
 lisitsyn	with such changes
 besser82	sonne|work, lisitsyn: If that would make sense?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no idea!
 sonne|work	besser82: it is work no idea who will do it
 lisitsyn	besser82: as for svm bright - please keep everything callbacked' :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: Sure ;)
 lisitsyn	malloc/print/data access
 lisitsyn	errors too may be
 besser82	lisitsyn: I actually planned to setup a nice class-based API/ABI  ;)
 sonne|work	there is some update_linear component stuff in svm light which we have heavily changed
 sonne|work	all far from easy to migrate even w/ a clean API
 besser82	lisitsyn: So full controll for your code  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: and some nice exception handling in case of problems  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah
 besser82	lisitsyn: Everything in fully transparent  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: providing easy-all-in-one-calls && advanced its-all-up-to-you-headers  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha too much marketing already ;)

@wiking	ok so now it's already there?
 besser82	wiking: /dev/vdb is up and just needs formatting && fstab :D
@wiking	besser82: shall i do it?
 besser82	wiking: if you want  :)
@wiking	ok
@wiking	let's see
@wiking	fdisk :)
 besser82	wiking: or sfdisk or parted  :-P
@wiking	hehehe done with fdisk :P
@wiking	/dev/vdb1              63    52428799    26214368+  83  Linux
@wiking	should be good
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|osx, sonne|work: Yo!  :D  Do you have a minute?
 besser82	wiking: +1  :D
@wiking	besser82: where should i mount it?
 besser82	wiking: I'd use /srv
 besser82	wiking: because of selinux  ;)
@wiking	besser82: in /etc/fstab is it ok if i refer to it by /dev/vdb1
@wiking	or should it be UUID?
 besser82	wiking: Like you want  ;)
 besser82	wiking: shouldn't change
 besser82	wiking: but with autocheck enabled  ;)  like ...  1 1$
@wiking	/dev/vdb1        25G   44M   24G   1% /srv
 besser82	wiking: and don't forget to `touch /.autorelabel && reboot`
 besser82	wiking: to make selinux happy
@wiking	eh?
 besser82	wiking: this will make selinux restore all default context on new mounted fs  ;)
 besser82	wiking: and reboot
 besser82	wiking: or shall I do just quick?
@wiking	besser82: yeps
 besser82	wiking: allrighty  :D  You will be logged out in a second  ;)

@wiking	i think i've logged out before
@wiking	besser82: let me know when it's back
@wiking	ah ok it's back
@wiking	cool
 besser82	wiking: Everything is fine?
@wiking	seems like
 besser82	wiking: for me too  ;)
@wiking	ok now we have to figure out how to share container instances between nodes :P
@wiking	but since docker uses aufs
@wiking	we can just use the diff of the container image
@wiking	i.e. the changes since it got fired up
@wiking	and that cannot be toooo much
@wiking	i.e. couple of megabytes
 besser82	wiking: I'm afraid AUFS and selinux don't play nice with oneanother  :(
@wiking	mmm well i guess we'll have to try :P

 taylan	Hi everyone..I got a couple of small questions about training a classifier with shogun..
 taylan	- 1. Do I need to scale the features I provide?
@wiking	taylan: 1) depends on the classifier you are trying to use. but as a general rule of thumb it's worth to try scaling
 taylan	2. Is there a module which optimizes kernel parameters, or should I write a wrapper around the crossvalidation evaluator to optimize the choice of kernel parameters?
@wiking	2) modelselection should do this for you
 taylan	Thanks wiking!
@wiking	nw
 taylan	I will check the model selection..
