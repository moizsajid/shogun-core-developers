@wiking	pong
@wiking	iglesiasg: re
@iglesiasg	wiking, about the ipython-notebooks, I remember it was mentioned something about hosting them somewhere
@iglesiasg	wiking, are the news regarding that?
@iglesiasg	are there*
@iglesiasg	I mean if we are hosting them somewhere
@wiking	iglesiasg: sonne|osx would know about this more
@iglesiasg	wiking, all right, thanks!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, let me know if so ;)
@wiking	okey this commit is going to b funny ;)

@HeikoS	hi all!
@wiking	yo
@HeikoS	wiking: yo!
@HeikoS	wiking: here for some shogun hacking :)
@HeikoS	whats currently important?
@wiking	HeikoS: mm i totally forgot what we should do with that SerialUTests branch
@HeikoS	wiking: so all tests apart from serialization are wokring?
@wiking	the other important part is thread-safe add_substack
@HeikoS	wiking: ah yes, ok
@HeikoS	wiking: but the testing should be done first right? since we already started
@HeikoS	ill build it and see
@wiking	i think it's failing big time :P
@HeikoS	what if the serialization is taken out, what happens?
 shogun-buildbot	build #1304 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1304  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@iglesiasg	wiking, btw, how is it going with the workshop videos? Do you want some help getting that done?
@HeikoS	wiking, iglesiasg what do you think if we modularize the source a bit
@HeikoS	so that one does not have to compile everythin
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I like that idea very much
@HeikoS	but only things that depend on the stuff on wants
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, it was one of the reasong why I thought it would be interesting to introduce cmake
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yea
@HeikoS	takes so long to compile everything currently
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, apart from cmake hacking, I guess it would require some refactoring
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: just wonderung whether its a good idea
@iglesiasg	like setting clear the boundaries between the modules, which ones are required by others and so on
@HeikoS	whether it really helps
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: but it should be possible to infer that from the includes shouldnt it?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I think it should be possible, yes
@HeikoS	so say I only want GPs
@HeikoS	for that, many parts are not really needed
@HeikoS	but how to group
@HeikoS	what are the modules?
@HeikoS	maybe if one specifies a list of classes that one wants?
@HeikoS	and then all dependencies are built
@iglesiasg	a first approach could be simply the directories we use
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: is that going to work?
@HeikoS	most things for example depend on machine
@HeikoS	but compiling all machines is already too much
@HeikoS	and most things have at least one dependecy in most directory
@iglesiasg	that's a good point
@HeikoS	drectories
@HeikoS	wiking: I just realised you use the clone_unittests file to generate the serial tests in another dir
@HeikoS	I think this should be moved to a seperate directory?
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Read error: Operation timed out]
@wiking	HeikoS: ?
@wiking	HeikoS: these files are generated under ./build/...
@wiking	so really... they should not matter... and how they are generetaed that's defined in cmake
@HeikoS	wiking: the python script that generates the file from a template
@HeikoS	is in base
@HeikoS	iglesiasg:
@HeikoS	[  FAILED  ] BeliefPropagation.tree_max_product_string

@iglesiasg	facepalm...
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I am almost sure that when I merged it, it was fine in travis
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, is that locally in your machine?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: its our fork from a few days ago
@HeikoS	checking further
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, ok
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you also tell shell to use an init() function to initialise parameters
@HeikoS	and not do this via the init lists in constructor
@HeikoS	redundant code and forgotten parameters
@iglesiasg	ok
@HeikoS	I have fixed 100s of those in the last wekk
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, he normally uses register_params or something called like that instead of init
@HeikoS	just init in register_parameters
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes but one also has to make sure that things are initialised
@HeikoS	otherwise memory errors
@HeikoS	wiking: ok all tests apart from serialization work now
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, ok, I understand. Thanks!
@HeikoS	wiking: should we merge the thing without the serialization tests for now?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, but where is that failing anyway?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: clone unit tests
@HeikoS	and produces random errors
@iglesiasg	damn it
@HeikoS	segfaults, worst case error ;)
@iglesiasg	I will tell Shell and try to have a look once I am done with the notebook I am doing at the moment
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I fixed a few for now, its just better practice in general to use an init method rather than the init -lists in the constructor in order to avoid double code when there are mutliple constructors
@HeikoS	with default values
@HeikoS	just initialise in register_parameters
@HeikoS	this is the best place since once doesnt forget things
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, absolutely, it makes total sense

@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yep thats the way to go :)
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, all right. For which one?
@iglesiasg	the travis build
@HeikoS	see above
@HeikoS	the merge I just did in a feature branch
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun
@iglesiasg	I think it is that one
@HeikoS	ah cool the sizte just shows all branches
@iglesiasg	that URL show last build I think
@iglesiasg	build history for the whole list
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: also do you know the best practice to merge a feature branch?
@HeikoS	do I do this locally on my machine in develop and then send a PR?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I normally send pull requests from the feature branch using github

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, yes, issue the pull request from my fork, using the desired feature branch
@iglesiasg	there is this nice green button that makes that automatically
@iglesiasg	when you push to your fork
 lisitsyn	ehm
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	you open in github the page for the branch
 lisitsyn	wtf
@HeikoS	just wondering because I pushed to the feature branch directly
@HeikoS	so its not even in my fork
@iglesiasg	and there is a button that compares the changes with that branch with upstream develop and allows you to make the PR
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, maybe you can fetch it and push it to your fork
@HeikoS	yes thats what I will do
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what is it? :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: my commit :D
@HeikoS	ah :)
 lisitsyn	how does it happen
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what do you want to send to the NIPS workshop?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: my photos
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: :)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well your photos ok
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay seriously I have no idea
 lisitsyn	we should talk to cheng may be
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes we should, but with an idea :)
@HeikoS	so its about integrating multiple ML methods
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean I don't know what they expect
@HeikoS	where is the page again?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: http://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/
@HeikoS	ok so its all about integrating multiple things to one another
@HeikoS	wow fernando perez is there
@HeikoS	ipython and opencv
@HeikoS	I definitely wanna go :)
@HeikoS	software packages can be submited
@HeikoS	we have all the new file readers/writers
@HeikoS	we have ipython integration in examples
@HeikoS	we have included many opensource libs
@HeikoS	that should be enough
@HeikoS	I already have a few examples in my head
@HeikoS	like comparison of different svm libs
@HeikoS	tapkee integration maybe
@HeikoS	for preprocessing
@HeikoS	we should do this!
@HeikoS	deadline is oct 9

@HeikoS	whats wrong?
@wiking	well it's a gitflow feature
@wiking	it doesn't need PR merge...
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	does that really matter?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	apart from good practice?
@HeikoS	wiking: ok changed, btw ascii is working now
@HeikoS	I made use of the accuracy parameter in equals
@HeikoS	ascii is lossy so comparing float numbers fails
@HeikoS	wiking: so how to merge the feature branch on github?
@wiking	on github
@wiking	no way
@wiking	commandline
@HeikoS	wiking: so I push to my fork and then PR that?
@HeikoS	against develop?
@wiking	no
@wiking	just push the changes into upstream's branch

@iglesiasg	it is over simple but it is an start :D
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: nice!
@HeikoS	reading
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: looks good
@iglesiasg	I am proof-reading now too hehe
@iglesiasg	thanks!
 lisitsyn	/fml/ag-raetsch/home/toussaint/scp/aawd_compbio_workshop/code_nora/data/profile/profiles
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ah man, thats so nice
 lisitsyn	lmfao
@HeikoS	finally I understand what you are working on :)
@HeikoS	please extend it, this is awesome!
@HeikoS	maybe some real data experiments?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sure!
@HeikoS	maybe add some references also
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I am not sure if I should do that in this one or in a new one. What is the philosophy for these notebooks? One extensive or several short ones?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, good idea
@HeikoS	wiking: how to run integration tests with cmake?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I would go for one very extensive for your GSoC project
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, all right
@HeikoS	these are not our documentation ones but rather for the GSoC projects
@HeikoS	so that we have one notebook from each student
@HeikoS	to show off :D
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, it is a great idea to make these notebooks for each project
@HeikoS	yeah, I think so

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, next I will include the wine data set
@iglesiasg	everybody drunk :D
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	wiking: still around?
@HeikoS	wiking: spaces in parameter names break the xml parser
@HeikoS	two options:
@HeikoS	1.) do not allow spaces in parameter names (I would do that anyway)
@HeikoS	2.) modify xml parser
@HeikoS	for 1.) we will have to change a few classes, which annoyingly means we will have to update the integration tests (I vote for removing them anyway)
@HeikoS	wiking: after that, xml will be working
@iglesiasg	pca should be burned
@iglesiasg	ours
@HeikoS	why?
@HeikoS	not working?
@wiking	HeikoS: yess
@HeikoS	wiking: ?
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i would just do a s/\ /_/g
@wiking	on space
@HeikoS	wiking: at which point?
@HeikoS	we cannot expect this from devs when registering the classes
@wiking	HeikoS: at writing out
@HeikoS	the easiest solution is to throw an error when a parameter name contains a space
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I see
@wiking	HeikoS: of course the problem will be the reading in
@wiking	:P
@HeikoS	wiking: I would like to avoid that
@HeikoS	rather not have spaces
@HeikoS	not reason for that anyway
@HeikoS	the names should be consistent with c++ names of members
@HeikoS	for many reasons
@HeikoS	and no spaces in there

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Some more MSVC fixes
@wiking	CDynamicArray<SGVector<index_t> >* m_oob_indicies;
@wiking	mmm this ain't wokring
@HeikoS	wiking: no
@wiking	any other ideas that doesn't including using STL
@HeikoS	dont do this
@wiking	yeah i realised
@wiking	but what then
@iglesiasg	time to jogging, see you later guys!
@HeikoS	what exactly do you need?
@wiking	CDynamicArray<SGVector<index_t> >* m_oob_indicies;
@wiking	SGVector<index_t>
@wiking	array
@wiking	or list
@HeikoS	dynamic?
@wiking	i dont mind
@wiking	yeah
-!- iglesiasg [~iglesias@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
@wiking	ooor
@wiking	not necesarrily
@HeikoS	wiking: how many dimensions
@wiking	2
@HeikoS	if its fixed, just use a matrix
@wiking	i mean SGVector<> is variable...
@wiking	i.e. not the same length
@HeikoS	if it has to be dynamic you can use DynamicArray
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	CList maybe?
@wiking	but the number of SGVector<> is 'fixed'
@wiking	can i add sgvector into a clist?
@HeikoS	do you just need the individual vectors?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	CList is CSGObject
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	good question then
@HeikoS	are the vectors lengths fixed?
@HeikoS	when you allocate?
@wiking	yes
@HeikoS	you could then just use a growing 1d array
@HeikoS	and map the indices
@wiking	eh
@wiking	no fucking way that it has to be this complicted
@wiking	to have a list of SGVectors
@wiking	i mean yeah i get it that we dont want to use STL
@wiking	but this is crazy
@HeikoS	wiking: the problem simply is
@HeikoS	that SG types are no CSGObjects
@HeikoS	maybe we should have wrapper classes
@HeikoS	for SGVector and SGMatrix
@HeikoS	what do you think about this?
@HeikoS	then you can CList these
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	CList not even needed then, CDynamicObjectArray
@HeikoS	wiking: I think thats best and would solve this problem
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you think?

@sonney2k	wiking, you can just have lists of SGVectors with DynamicArray - what is the issue?
@wiking	sonney2k: i've tried new CDynamicArray<SGVector<index_t> >()
@wiking	and it fails
@wiking	sonney2k: /Users/wiking/shogun/src/shogun/lib/DynamicArray.h:628,18 - Error - no matching member function for call to 'add_vector'
@wiking	if i try doing that new
@wiking	basically it cannot do this for SGVector<index_t>: m_parameters->add_vector(&m_array.array, &m_array.current_num_elements, "array", "Memory for dynamic array.");

@wiking	HeikoS: android irc? seriously? :D
@sonney2k	wiking, why are you doing this? dynamic array is what you should add and it is an CSGObject
@sonney2k	alright so we have 3 buildbots still failing - cyg,bsd,osx
@sonney2k	then we are back to normal
@wiking	you mean CDynamicArray< CDynamicArray<index_t> >?
@wiking	sonney2k: afaik i dont generate the static interfaces in the right way + testing of them is not done yet
@wiking	sonney2k: now i'l just compiling the files in the _static dir and then link it with the shared libshogun
@wiking	sonney2k: btw msvc compiling is going to take a loooong while :)

@sonney2k	wiking, what? no  new CDynamicArray<SGVector<index_t> >() will work
@wiking	sonney2k: no it does not
@wiking	try it yourself
@wiking	now i ended up doing DynamicObjectArray of DynamicArray
@sonney2k	try int64_t instead of index_t
@sonney2k	wiking, not the intended solution
@sonney2k	way to cumbersome
@sonney2k	wiking, regarding msvc - I know it is not exactly a standard compliant compiler
@wiking	sonney2k: neither with int64_t nor with int32_t...
@sonney2k	wiking, well we use it this way
@wiking	where?
@wiking	CDynamicArray<SGVector<int64_t> >* a = new CDynamicArray<SGVector<int64_t> >();
@wiking	this is just error
@sonney2k	wiking, what error?
@wiking	no workie :P
@wiking	/Users/wiking/shogun/src/shogun/lib/DynamicArray.h:628,18 - Error - no matching member function for call to 'add_vector'
@wiking	same as CDynamicArray<SGVector<index_t> >
@sonney2k	hmmhh bug in serialization code then
@sonney2k	wiking, actually easy to fix
@sonney2k	wiking, just add a add_vector method in base/Parameter.h for your SGVector<index_t> type
@sonney2k	wiking, and treat it the same way like the add_vector index_t** type
@sonney2k	and done
