 lisitsyn1	just this gsoc iirc
 khalednasr	which model?
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/io/UAIFile.cpp
 lisitsyn1	this is the thing
 lisitsyn1	I don't know whether it is very good designed already
 lisitsyn1	but afaik it is something similar to what you'd need

 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, I took a look at the UAI file stuff, It would work if we only wanted to specify the connectivity of the network, but we also need to specify the type of layers and the hyper parameters
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, maybe I could use JSON?
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: nono I mean it is something that serves similar purpose
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, I see. what do you think about using json or xml?
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: I am quite ok with either of them
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, cool
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: the question is
 lisitsyn1	you know we have json
 lisitsyn1	but it is something that serializes our shogun internal things into json
 lisitsyn1	and back

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn1, workshop starting tomorrow at my old uni
 lisitsyn1	ahh cool
 thoralf	Hey :)
* thoralf just got a confirmation that we can do the SHOGUN-Hands-On on Sunday, 27th of July at ReasearchGate.
 thoralf	Berlin-Mitte, close to Hauptbahnhof and other transports.
 thoralf	I'll send a more official announcement for this soon.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, great!
 lisitsyn1	ah berlin berlin
 lisitsyn1	ah guys I have to announce I probably won't be there :(
@wiking	unfortunately possible me neither
 lisitsyn1	it seems I am moving to moscow
 lisitsyn1	just around this date
 lisitsyn1	will have to do a lot of stuff
* wiking moving as well
 lisitsyn1	wiking: where to? :)
@wiking	or seems like at least
@wiking	lisitsyn1: heheh dont want to jinx it
 lisitsyn1	japan?
 lisitsyn1	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn1: close...
 lisitsyn1	really?
@wiking	yep, but i really dont want to jinx it
 lisitsyn1	wiking: sure ;)

@HeikoS	thoralf: could you update the google doc?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Don't have my google credentials at work... maybe on the weekend.

@HeikoS	lambday: hey
@HeikoS	just reading your patch
 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah just read your comments
 lambday	HeikoS: so I added sum_rowwise, sum_colwise as you suggested
@HeikoS	lambday: cool
 lambday	got this feeling that you'd like it this way :)
@HeikoS	lambday: haha :)
@HeikoS	lambday: so lets step a bit back and get the big picture of the current state now ....
 lambday	HeikoS: regarding square, though, I'm not sure!
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, why?
@HeikoS	lambday: this square thing is nice to have, but it will create a new matrix right?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that's true
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
 lambday	for a very brief period thogh
@HeikoS	lambday: so, what is missing for the MMD stuff to work?
@HeikoS	lambday: but allocating takes time
@HeikoS	lambday: whereas summing up squares does not
 lambday	HeikoS: alright but that
 lambday	's a way too specific task to go to linalg, no?
 lambday	umm.. although squared_sum can be done
-!- cuphrody [cuphrody@211.69.205.236] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 lambday	so - I'll change that!
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah sum up squares is sueful
@HeikoS	useful
 lambday	HeikoS: as of now, nothing is missing for mmd to work - in fact I just modified quadratic time mmd to compute statistic and variance on the fly
@HeikoS	lambday: ok cool
@HeikoS	lambday: what about all those different MMD null approximations?
@HeikoS	lambday: thats where we left the thing a while ago
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah! - so as we discussed, I added these enums
@HeikoS	lambday: cool
 lambday	so, there are 2 enums for MMD_SPECTRUM now
@HeikoS	lambday: nice
@HeikoS	lambday: do you have an estimate for how long these things will take to wrap up? then dino and I can plan a bit
@HeikoS	lambday: we will probably start writing some experiments with all of this later in June
 lambday	HeikoS: well, quadratic time mmd I'll finish by tonight or tomorrow
 lambday	then BTest and linear time mmd - by next week!
 lambday	actually I'll make a doc to keep track of things
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, no rush, I am just asking
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah a doc would be great
@HeikoS	lambday: since GSoC also started officially now, we should soon transition to the feature selection stuff :)
 lambday	HeikoS: since I deviated from this for a while I lost track :/
@HeikoS	lambday: haha :)
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah no worries, you are doing great work here
@HeikoS	lambday: I already might have a customer for feature selection stuff, so that is nice
 lambday	HeikoS: wow that's cool! :d
@HeikoS	lambday: do you need any input on something?
 lambday	HeikoS: umm.... can't think of any right now - if I remmebe something, will mail you and dino?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah sure
 lambday	HeikoS: so, we had a whole bunch of tasks planned - I'll reschedule things a bit after finishing with MMD... as per earlier estimation this would have been done long ago while I was doing btest :(
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I know
@HeikoS	I am actually thinking of postponing a few things thats why I am asking you
@HeikoS	lambday: but also great to have, so its fine if you spend another week on those things
@HeikoS	then later in the summer we will make use of those things and maybe request some updates/find problems ,etc
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that sounds good
 lambday	well I was kind of worried to catch up on the schedule that I planned
@HeikoS	which of the feature selection things would you like to start with?
@HeikoS	lambday: dont worry, rather take time to do things properly, thats worth more :)
 lambday	HeikoS: we can start with smola's paper, right? feature selection via dependence maximization

@HeikoS	lambday: BAHSIC you mean?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: about the Block stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: (sorry to jump back here=)
 lambday	no worries
@HeikoS	lambday: if one computes the sum of a matrix block
@HeikoS	does this copy the block around?
 lambday	HeikoS: nah
@HeikoS	or how does this work?
@HeikoS	lambday: sorry for asking (I could also read code, but since you are here thats faster)
 lambday	well, as of now I just used eigen3, which refers to blocks in the orig matrix via those block() calls
 lambday	HeikoS: so, no copying
@HeikoS	lambday: and SGMatrix?
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.200.183.38] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
@HeikoS	ah sorry
@HeikoS	so that creates a map first
@HeikoS	lambday: so the naive implementation could just map indices then?
@HeikoS	like a subset?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that's the best way I guess
 lambday	HeikoS: I haven't added naive implementation though
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
@HeikoS	lambday: no need for now
@HeikoS	(entrance task :) )
 lambday	hahaha :D
@HeikoS	maybe make a list of future entrance tasks somewhere
@HeikoS	seriously, I always forget them, its important to grow those on the fly
 lambday	umm yeah might be good - we always forget stuffs
@HeikoS	and its a good  entrance task
@HeikoS	one learns a lot
@HeikoS	lambday: ok then
@HeikoS	BAHSIC is the first algo for feature selection
@HeikoS	lambday: some design questions naturally appear
@HeikoS	lambday: Preprocessor
@HeikoS	variable-selection-preprocessor
@HeikoS	we dont have any of those
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - I have to read the paper in more details to get how do they do it.. currently not having much idea how do add these in preprocessors...
@HeikoS	lambday: its just backward elimination of features using HSIC as a measure of dependence
@HeikoS	lambday: super easy
@HeikoS	lambday: and design is independent of paper
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe dino and I can share some thoughts, we discussed this a while ago
@HeikoS	will try to squeeze this in
 lambday	alright - so basically among different feature selection algo, the measure of dependence is what differs, right?
@HeikoS	lambday: yes
@HeikoS	the algorithm always removes the feature that is least informative
 lambday	HeikoS: so the different independence measures that we planned to have, will be used by this feature selection framework
 lambday	sorry for sounding super obvious - just trying to get clear thoughts :)

@HeikoS	lambday: yes
@HeikoS	lambday: so we need one that selects a number of variables from the input features

 lambday	HeikoS: okay - so, we need one hierarchy of classes FeatureSelection - some base class - subclasses use different dependence measures - provides means for applying the subsetting
@HeikoS	lambday: yes!
 lambday	HeikoS: and then one preprocessor having an instance of this feature selection inside it
@HeikoS	lambday: I think it would be nice if it was so modular that we can just plug in different measures into different algorithms
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... yeah that's better - so may be we provide some method in those dependence measures only :/
 lambday	HeikoS: then feature selection works with those methods
 lambday	not sure though - just thinking
@HeikoS	lambday: no wait, the preprocessor does the feature selection
@HeikoS	and it gets an instance of the dependence measure
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - so, it all works with C<dependence-measure-class>::sample_null() ??
@HeikoS	lambday: mmh goo dpoint
@HeikoS	lambday: I am not sure wheather we need that
 lambday	I mean are the null samples the only things that we need to do feature selection?
 lambday	HeikoS: I'm not sure - may be I'll read the paper today and try to get an idea :/
@HeikoS	for BAHSIC, one just computes the statistic doesnt one? (not sure currently, hehe)
@HeikoS	lambday: see also arthurs lecture slides
@HeikoS	http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/rkhscourse.html
@HeikoS	lceture 4,5,6 slides
 lambday	HeikoS: checking...
 lambday	(I took printed copies of those :D)
@HeikoS	slide 177
@HeikoS	hehe
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - just the arg max of statistic
 lambday	then remove that one
 lambday	ah got it
 lambday	so, other algorithms would work this way only - then we can have it this way - FeatureSelection ---> DensePreprocessor, have an instance of IndependenceTest, overrides apply_to_feature_matrix, inside this it uses IndependenceTest::compute_statistic and remove the irrelevent ones iteratively
 lambday	so this loop would go inside that
@HeikoS	yeah, so that should work with any dependence measure right? :) backwards elemination
@HeikoS	exactly
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah - although I am stuck at (Why backwords?) :D
 lambday	I mean, if backword elimination works for all then this simple structure would suffice
@HeikoS	lambday: if you go forward and start adding features, you will miss pairwise dependencies
@HeikoS	lambday: or what did you mean?
 lambday	aaahhh
 lambday	yeah
 lambday	got your pt
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I meant that only
 lambday	cool!
 lambday	HeikoS: alright! feeling a bit relaxed.. got the main points - I'll try to finish quadratic time mmd (almost done - except spectrum)..
@HeikoS	lambday: cool! yeah relax, this will be fun, no need to freak out, rather enjoy, its cool stuff! :)
 lambday	HeikoS: I'll read the soon and start with this issue first - so we'll have the framework ready - later we can add different dependence measures
 lambday	HeikoS: oh another thing - will it work similarly for conditional dependence measures?

@HeikoS	lambday: good point!
@HeikoS	lambday: when you set up the doc, put those things in
@HeikoS	we can then give feedback and discuss
 lambday	HeikoS: alright that sounds good!
@HeikoS	lambday: I agree that we should draft base classes first, without implementations,
 lambday	yeah!

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hey!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, hi!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, did you get my msg?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: do you have a minute to discuss?
@HeikoS	not yet, currently working throgh a batch of emails :)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, no i pinged you here
 Saurabh7	i think got dc first
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ah no
 Saurabh7	yeah have some time
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so lets discuss the first week
@HeikoS	and update the doc
 Saurabh7	I have prepared a draft of first task
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: nice!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes i will update the detail part tomorrow first thing
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: could you give me a link?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  should i send in a pr about the first one?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: no need for a PR, just a link for me to see
 Saurabh7	nbviewer?
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: but maybe even put the current state into a PR then I can start reviewing
 Saurabh7	sec
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: but wait
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: lets also discuss a bit what to go in there, what is your plan for this notebookss
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	but maybe its good to go from notebook, so lets see the link! :)
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ah
 Saurabh7	here it is http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/Saurabh7/5557715ec5ad323ffafe#
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: this already looks very nice
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  oh ! good..
 Saurabh7	any suggestions?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I like this direction a lot
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: providing some very simple example of things and then pointing to the other notebooks
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes thats what i planned
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so this is like basic supervised classification
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, we can group similar nbs together further
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I will try to come up with some feedback soon, but for now this looks good so you can keep on working in this direction
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes its the simplest i could get hold of
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yes I agree
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: great work! :)
 Saurabh7	so instead of say 'supervised'  pointing to wiki , we can point it to the bunch
@HeikoS	like the reference to the web demo
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yeah maybe, thats also good for the website
@HeikoS	like it scikit
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: BTW could you condense a list of Shogun's features on the fly
@HeikoS	maybe put them in the document
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: since we desperately need this up to date :)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ok this looks good,
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes because the nbs are pretty complicated to browse through
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yup i am trying to set up a diagram
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I guess you could elaborate a bit on other cases: other features, regression ... etc, but that might come later
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yes, great idea! really like it
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: You should add some section on the interfaces of features
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: like number of vectors, dimension, etc
@HeikoS	And maybe also some things on other feature types
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  ok nice, will try to look into that
@HeikoS	this notebook can grow a bit, there could also be an example for regression and maybe even a preprocessor
@HeikoS	since those are very fundamental
 Saurabh7	yes
 Saurabh7	i was afraid to make it too complicated
@HeikoS	like one simple example each?
@HeikoS	yes I know what you mean
@HeikoS	but if the thing just grows a bit thats fine
 Saurabh7	ok i will try to come up with something about regression
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	I mean the focus is just on the setting of the method, not so much about details, so you can just use a particular algorithm under the CMachine interface and then point to another notebook for method details,
@HeikoS	like you already did
@HeikoS	mean remove, unit variance preprocessor might be good
@HeikoS	or whitening
@HeikoS	since those are std things
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ok, let me know how it goes
 Saurabh7	yup seems good
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: btw you should include nbviewer links in your weekly updates to the list, people will love them :)
 Saurabh7	i will try to set up a diagram and example by tomorrow
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: and send a PR of this one already, together with the nbviwer link, I will put some comments,
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: Nice! Glad how this is going! Keep on the good work!
 Saurabh7	ok will send it now
 Saurabh7	but its late here so will have to address them tomorrow
@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  I will leave now then. Having a look later today.
 Saurabh7	thanks!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yeah no problem
 Saurabh7	ok np

@besser82	thoralf|home, btw. what is the correct procedure to convert the mallet model and stuff to vectors?
@besser82	thoralf|home, so I can train a model from the findings with liblinear?
 thoralf|home	besser82: You can.
 thoralf|home	besser82: Create a feature vector, where the i-th component is the probability of the i-th topic.
@besser82	thoralf|home, let's get that german  ;)
