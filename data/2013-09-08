@sonney2k	wiking, what is wrong with the ovh kernel?
@wiking	sonney2k: i cannot run virtualmachine with this kernel
@wiking	sonney2k: i've downloaded their kernel .config and did the mods that is required for being able to run it
@wiking	and now we have the deb packages of

@wiking	i wonder if i can install and reboot

@wiking	this iiiis cool
@wiking	sonney2k: i've just transferred the whole static anlysis report from the slave to master
@wiking	and it's integrated into buildbot site
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/
@sonney2k	wiking, parse error
@sonney2k	wiking, you did what?
@sonney2k	wiking, you copied the stuff?
@sonney2k	wiking, or you run the static analysis on the webserver?
@wiking	sonney2k: no it's copied via the buildbot setup
@wiking	so i dont need to scp or anything
@wiking	it's just
@sonney2k	I need that too!
@wiking	another step
@wiking	factories['static_analysis'].addStep(DirectoryUpload(slavesrc="static_analysis", masterdest="~/masters/shogun/public_html/static_analysis", url="/static_analysis", alwaysRun=True))
@wiking	there's the same for file...
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh cool
@wiking	if u dont need a whole directory
@wiking	btw we need virtualbox..
@sonney2k	this way we can get the osx dmg's etc to the master
@sonney2k	and also doxygen etc etc
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	that's what it's for
@sonney2k	wiking, I am pretty concerned that what we are trying to do currently is not giving us a release any time soon
@sonney2k	it is too much work
@wiking	no it'll be ready :)
@wiking	i'm just concerned now how different the clang analyzer output on that ubuntu
@sonney2k	look at how many bugs the static analysis discovered...
@wiking	and the one i have here on osx
@sonney2k	wiking, well I guess it got improved
@wiking	ah ok fuck
@wiking	i know why
@wiking	because there's like zillions of hooks missing
@sonney2k	which hooks?
@wiking	can Apple LLVM version 4.2 (clang-425.0.28) (based on LLVM 3.2svn)
@wiking	sonney2k: basically i have this llvm
@sonney2k	pretty new stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, we could run things on the debian-sid buildslave I just set up
@wiking	while the debian is old
@sonney2k	it has llvm3.5
@sonney2k	3.4
@wiking	sonney2k: either that
@wiking	sonney2k: or roll our own llvm
@wiking	on that build machine
@wiking	For other platforms, you must build Clang and LLVM manually. To do so, please follow the instructions for building Clang from source code.
@wiking	:)
@wiking	from http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/installation.html
@wiking	or maybe somebody did this already
@wiking	sonney2k: basically there are various hooks of the clang analyzer
@wiking	and there's a lot of missing
@wiking	like
@wiking	+ unix.API                        Check calls to various UNIX/Posix functions + unix.Malloc                     Check for memory leaks, double free, and use-after-free problems. Traces memory managed by malloc()/free(). + unix.MallocSizeof               Check for dubious malloc arguments involving sizeof + unix.MismatchedDeallocator      Check for mismatched deallocators.
@wiking	 + unix.string.BadSizeArg   g      Check the size argument passed into C string functions for common erroneous patterns + unix.cstring.NullArg            Check for null pointers being passed as arguments to C string functions
@wiking	or
@wiking	cplusplus.NewDelete             Check for double-free and use-after-free problems. Traces memory managed by new/delete.
@wiking	which are pretty important
@wiking	sooo
@wiking	question
@wiking	maybe somebody maintains
@wiking	a deb package repo of llvms
@wiking	sonney2k: can u install clang on sid
@wiking	and pastebin the scan-build --help output
@wiking	?
@wiking	http://llvm.org/apt/
@wiking	hah
@wiking	:D
@sonney2k	wiking, https://gist.github.com/sonney2k/6487866
@wiking	oookeeey
@wiking	which bot is this?
@wiking	this will be much better
@wiking	i reckon there's really no need for running various clang static analysis
@wiking	so i'll just replace this with your bot
@wiking	let me know when u have the buildslave running :)
@wiking	in the meanwhile i'll fix the memcheck reports
@sonney2k	wiking, just create one on the master
@sonney2k	I dont' know which name to give it
@wiking	?
@sonney2k	debian - sid - libshogun?
@wiking	for the bot
@sonney2k	wiking, well I installed all stuff on fatbot
@sonney2k	but not more yet
@wiking	shogun-debian-sid
@wiking	and the target should be
@sonney2k	wiking, just do it
@wiking	sid - libshogun
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	what's the passwd
@wiking	ok i'll check
@wiking	;)
@wiking	please dont edit the master.cfg then
@sonney2k	wiking just do schroot -c debian-sid
@sonney2k	wiking, I don't
@sonney2k	wiking, I am installing ubuntu currently...
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	sonney2k: have u installed the packages?
@sonney2k	wiking, tons of ...
@wiking	okok cool
@sonney2k	no idea if these are all
@wiking	i'll create the buildbot user
@wiking	etc
@sonney2k	I think we need a list of pkgs
@wiking	u forgot ccache ;P
@sonney2k	wiking, just install it :P

@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	screw ubuntu lTS
@sonney2k	it is sooo damn old
@sonney2k	wiking, yes ubuntu LTS is old
@sonney2k	wiking, only non-LTS stuff is fresh
@sonney2k	I have no idea why people use ubuntu... after all they only support like 10% of the packages debian has
@sonney2k	and it is outdated
@sonney2k	anyway industry like ubuntu LTS so grrrmpf
@wiking	ok
@wiking	this is loooking niiice
@sonney2k	what?
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-08-1/
@wiking	:D
@wiking	sonney2k: there's like a bug
@wiking	that's discovered by taking 20 steps
@wiking	across various functions
@wiking	;P
@wiking	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-08-1/report-dd21c5.html#EndPath
@sonney2k	just 86 errors
@wiking	and u can start clicking backwards
@wiking	that's ok
@wiking	dead assignments are the most
@wiking	that are not used at all so it's only rm
@wiking	line
@sonney2k	wiking, well I suspect that there might be a reason why the variable got assigned in the first place
@sonney2k	so it might be a bug o_O
@sonney2k	anyway it is a relatively moderate number of bugs
@sonney2k	wiking, could you setup ubuntu bot please on the master?

 shogun-buildbot	build #3 of clang34 - static analysis is complete: Failure [failed analyse]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20static%20analysis/builds/3
@sonney2k	mean
@wiking	ok this schroot i dont like
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
@wiking	what if other person wants to connect to the
@sonney2k	reasons?
@wiking	chroot
@sonney2k	what's up?
@wiking	if i'm running the schroot
@wiking	will u still be able to connect to the same instance?
@sonney2k	r, --run-session
@sonney2k	              Run  an  existing session.  The session ID is specified with the
@sonney2k	              --chroot option.
@sonney2k	so I guess yes
@sonney2k	wiking, and while you are at it could you please deactivate buildslaves 1 & 3? I mean fatbot should just take over
@wiking	will do
@sonney2k	wiking, I have a cmake question...
@sonney2k	    EXECUTE_PROCESS(
@sonney2k	        COMMAND ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} -c "import os.path,time;print time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', time.gmtime(os.path.getmtime(\"${ROOT_DIR}/NEWS\")))"
@sonney2k	        OUTPUT_VARIABLE DATEINFO
@sonney2k	        OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE
@sonney2k	    )
@wiking	eh?
@wiking	what's with it?
@sonney2k	I need the mtime of NEWS printed as YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE
@sonney2k	wiking, basically bessel82 figured out that we cannot compile when .git is not existent
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	yes
@wiking	that's true
@sonney2k	becuase DATEINFO is not set
@sonney2k	wiking, the way I set this back in configure times was to do ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} -c "import os.path,time;print time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M', time.gmtime(os.path.getmtime(\"${ROOT_DIR}/NEWS\")))"
@sonney2k	now this no longer works with cmake for reasons beyond my understanding
@sonney2k	wiking, Ohh I figured I can just use stat -c %y NEWS
@sonney2k	that is good enough
