@sonney2k	what happened?
 blackburn	someone killed +1 :D
@sonney2k	great
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rde6f679 / testsuite/python_modular/clustering.py : Removed junk from clustering tester - http://git.io/fuzXfg

@sonney2k	blackburn, you might have to run generator.py *logplus*.py
@sonney2k	and commit the data
 blackburn	sonney2k: it doesn't work
@sonney2k	what does not work?
 blackburn	generator.py *logplus*.py
@sonney2k	generator.py preprocessor_logplusone_modular.py
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	ok

 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r13d738f / data : Updated data - http://git.io/brd-uQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: preprocessors OK
 blackburn	sonney2k: kernels left
@sonney2k	blackburn did you git commti data too?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	k
@sonney2k	I don't really care about these kernels
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	Because I am too tired now
 blackburn	so what to do?
@sonney2k	I would rather release with them being broken
@sonney2k	and fix them in som 1.0.1
 blackburn	as you wish
 blackburn	kinda russian way to do things haha
 blackburn	we do rockets the same way
@sonney2k	I have to debug the make release script still anyways
@sonney2k	I mean I can only do that 'live'
* sonney2k runs make prepare-release
@sonney2k	that will take 30 minutes or so
@sonney2k	so feel free to hunt more bugs
 serialhex	YAY bug-hunting :)
 blackburn	SystemError: [ERROR] Trying to access string[58] but num_str=11
 blackburn	that shit is awful
 blackburn	I am afraid of serious bug there
@sonney2k	serialhex, we will try to release now... with remaining bugs fixed in next release
@sonney2k	blackburn, where does this happen?
 blackburn	../data/kernel/HistogramWordString_DNA_0_3_60_False.m
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	python_modular still ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?
@sonney2k	which interace?
@sonney2k	interface/
 blackburn	sonney2k: python modular
 blackburn	sonney2k: fuck that just make a release
 blackburn	just let fix Oligo kernel, Poly string kernel and LocalAlignment kernel
 blackburn	in spare time or so
@sonney2k	I have to compile and test all interfaces - in the process
@sonney2k	so I am doing
@sonney2k	but it takes tiiiiiime
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you sure you want release just now?
@sonney2k	why not?
 blackburn	you say you are too tired now
@sonney2k	these kernels / things above not really used so ...
@sonney2k	black tea powered
 blackburn	up to you
 blackburn	just wanted to say there is no crime to release evening or so
@sonney2k	I hope it finishes java soon
@sonney2k	blackburn, recall that I start a new job tomorrow
 blackburn	I know
@sonney2k	so releasing will give me a bit of peace of mind
@sonney2k	to focus on other things
@sonney2k	of course I will start polishing for a 1.0.1 release but not under any pressure :)
@sonney2k	so we can have serialhex's further examples etc
@sonney2k	and other fixes in 1.0.1
 blackburn	okay sure
@sonney2k	I hope my release script works
 serialhex	sonney2k, whats the new job your starting??
 blackburn	well it seems we have fixed the most structure bugs
@sonney2k	serialhex, TomTom
 serialhex	tomtom?  like the gps-device-that speaks -to-you company tomtom??
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	you know they have lots of data and need for algorithms :)
 serialhex	spiffy!!  that's really cool, i hope you have fun there :D
 serialhex	yes, i'm sure they do!!!
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you add the bugs we have to the bts?
 blackburn	sonney2k: to the what?
@sonney2k	trac
@sonney2k	bts == bug tracking system
 blackburn	ah sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, this reminds me that we should move most of the inline functions into the .cpp files
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm stupid russian redneck be as simple as possible :D
@sonney2k	compile time is just ##$K%$%!
@sonney2k	it did python/java/csharp/ruby
 blackburn	sonney2k: so will .deb be also available?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
 blackburn	sonney2k: only tagging?
@sonney2k	deb is too complex to do now
@sonney2k	branch / tag hopefully
@sonney2k	and automated make update-webpage
@sonney2k	but who knows...
 blackburn	what a piece of shit we do
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay reported 6 regressions
@sonney2k	it is checking examples now
@sonney2k	some in octave static fail it seems
@sonney2k	blackburn, so please another bug report fix octave static examples
 blackburn	sonney2k: did

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmm how do I transfer the branch/tag?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw look at http://mloss.org/software/view/2/
@sonney2k	>600 views today - wtf !?!
 blackburn	600
 blackburn	??
@sonney2k	way too many
@sonney2k	no idea who is clicking this page!
@sonney2k	blackburn, did university start?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah, had 3 lectures today
@sonney2k	great - so you will become even more bright :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you still have some energy - feel free to fix the remaining issues
@sonney2k	when serialhex completes the examples + we have gotten some bug reports we should also make a new bugfix release
@sonney2k	I am still polishing the release script but I guess it will be pretty automagic soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: bright in what mean?
@sonney2k	bright == clever/ intelligent
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah I'm not :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, I am pretty happy that we managed to release yesterday - was quite some effort...
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah, a lot of bugs :D
@sonney2k	bugs usually multiply

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh git push --all syncs all branches
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	could have done git push github shogun_1.0:shougun_1.0 to only sync one it seems
@sonney2k	anyway
@sonney2k	now it should be there
 blackburn	sonney2k: wow, c5.0??
 blackburn	ah, c50 branch
@sonney2k	would be nice to have wouldn't it?
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	btw what happened to gsomix?
@sonney2k	Haven't seen him for a long time...
 blackburn	sonney2k: nothing, he is in my room, talking to my neighbor right now :D
 blackburn	he plans to work on some more tasks but a bit later
 blackburn	the problem is he have no serious motivation with machine learning
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah then it is not really fun for him and I can understand
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really *not fun*, he just didn't yet decided what he wants
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen Q about images?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think we really could have some image features
@sonney2k	what are image features?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't know how it could look like, but something more convenient than store images as vectors
@sonney2k	but bytefeatures are just that no?
 blackburn	sonney2k: in byte/real/anyother features we have to flatten images
@sonney2k	flatten?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	what do you mean
@sonney2k	pixel values 0..255
 blackburn	sonney2k: store the image as the vector
@sonney2k	ahh
 blackburn	e.g. image 10x10 should be flatten to vector of length 100
@sonney2k	as long as I don't work with images I won't implement such features :)
@sonney2k	but of course patches welcome :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: if I work with some professor here there will be a lot of image things ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: will do some medical images classification may be
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll ask that guy what he wants and implement it gradually
