 AndreLopes	Hi
 AndreLopes	../examples/documented/java_modular/classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.java
 AndreLopes	In this example
 AndreLopes	I got a warning
 AndreLopes	[WARN] In file /builddir/build/BUILD/shogun-96f3cf3ce58514299f98e688b7c43e057ad4fa41/src/shogun/classifier/AveragedPerceptron.cpp line 90: Averaged Perceptron algorithm did not converge after 10 iterations.
 AndreLopes	Is this normal to the example ?
 AndreLopes	And why does the neural network only accepts a DynamicObjectArray ?
 AndreLopes	And also this.. SwigType_p_p_shogun_CSGObject

@besser82	lisitsyn, ping? ^^
@besser82	lisitsyn, can you please give me commit-access to your swig-fork on github?  =)

@lisitsyn	besser82: oops sorry
@lisitsyn	yeah sure
@lisitsyn	besser82: have fun :)
@besser82	lisitsyn, thx ^^

@besser82	lisitsyn, force pushed rebased commit into bugfix-branch
@besser82	lisitsyn, you should be able to resolve that by:  git checkout bugfix/apple_clang_check && git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/bugfix/apple_clang_check

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: around?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I have a ML kind of problem - I have a few distributions (say 10)
 sonne|work	and some mixture of these 10 distributions with unknown coefficients
 sonne|work	I am now looking for a way to estimate the coefficients
 sonne|work	and these given distributions are just based on counts - so histograms
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: any assumption on distributions? :)
 sonne|work	none
@lisitsyn	why not to fit GMM?
 sonne|work	I could smooth them all :)
 sonne|work	well the base distribs are not gaussians
@lisitsyn	then choose something general and fit it with l-bfgs maybe?
 sonne|work	or some gradient decent kind of thing ... hmmhh sure would work
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: scipy has cool fmin_bfgs just give it a task
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yeah that would do it
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: can you assume gamma distribution
@lisitsyn	?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: no the histograms can be anything even some multimodal stuff
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: but that's good enough
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: fitting multimodal mixture sounds scary :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: relax all 1d - not so scary
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	why not to assume # of distributions equals # of modes?
@lisitsyn	then gaussian is good
 sonne|work	all I know is that the resulting distribution is a mixture of the others - and I would 'just' want to know the most likely mixture coefficients
 sonne|work	if the match is good enough then I can infer voila the distribution did get generated from the following sources

@lisitsyn	wiking: ja
@wiking	lisitsyn: how do u use numpy array as a RealFeatures?
@wiking	btw pytthon modular is totally broken still on osx
@wiking	segfaults:<
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah I know
@lisitsyn	RealFeatures(array)

@wiking	lisitsyn: here?
@wiking	lisitsyn: how the hell do u matplotlib a 2d numpy array, where each element is [a,b]. and the whole numpy array is like [[a,b],[x,v]...]
@lisitsyn	wiking: hmm
@lisitsyn	wiking: dont' get it
@lisitsyn	you need 2xN matrix?
@wiking	i just want to plot a 2d graph
@wiking	where the input is
@wiking	[[[a,b],[x,v]...]
@wiking	imean [[a,b],[x,v]...]
@wiking	but if i do axis.plot(x...)
@wiking	then i just get one part of each element of the arrays (the first) as y and x is basicaly the lenght of the array
