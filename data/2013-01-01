@sonney2k	blackburn, happy new year too :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: happy new year!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I've just survived WWIII
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
 blackburn	hahah I've got it
@sonney2k	just the german way of saying hi to the new year
 blackburn	explosions?
 blackburn	sort of nuclear explosions? :)
@sonney2k	in our (small) street we had a firework at least as crazy as the one at brandenburgs gate
@sonney2k	yes everyone is quite 'equipped' here
 blackburn	hah I see
 blackburn	did you fire some?
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	we stopped that in 2007 IIRC
@sonney2k	but I definitely lost the competition
@sonney2k	we have a new street king
@sonney2k	he arrived with these wooden things that you normally carry beer crates on
@sonney2k	but instead of beer he had massively many fireworks on them
@sonney2k	and one could really recognize some kind of 'direction' behind scenes
@sonney2k	first the lower level fountains/fireworks
@sonney2k	then the big kaboom stuff
@sonney2k	lasting 30 minutes
 blackburn	haha I am surprised with all that madness that happens in your country
 blackburn	people really reduced use of fireworks here
 blackburn	I talked to parents they think people start to use *bigger* fireworks not reduced :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: you are definitely having fun :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but I am in the suburbs of berlin
 blackburn	are people in the center having more fun?
@sonney2k	in the city centre (where I used to live) things are really crazy
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	it really is like WWIII
@sonney2k	density of people is higher so is the firework!
 blackburn	I cleaned my house's yard from used fireworks today :D
 blackburn	we are drinking still :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: so you have a lot of fireworks but no drinks right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no both :)
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	guten morgen everyone :D
