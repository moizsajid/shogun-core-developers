@sonney2k	wiking, I see
 wiking	and in c++ i return CData* from the dynarray
 wiking	but if i cannot do this casting
 wiking	then there's no way u can use this from python
 blackburn	unsolvable shit
 wiking	:(
@sonney2k	wiking, so you need to implement multiple classes right?
 wiking	yes
@sonney2k	and one depends on the extended other one
@sonney2k	yeah - no idea
@sonney2k	ask on the swig ml
 wiking	and since it's always application dependent
 wiking	i cannot even like predefine a set of classes in c++
@sonney2k	solution would be to have one class doing both :D
 wiking	haha
 wiking	overkill
 wiking	:>
@sonney2k	wiking, well ask on the swig ML!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will patch PCA soon to use redsvd
 blackburn	impressive thing
 blackburn	decomposition of 10k x 10k sparse matrix in 1.5 seconds
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is redsvd?
 blackburn	http://code.google.com/p/redsvd/wiki/English sonney2k
@sonney2k	impressive and yet another dependency :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: all code in .hpp
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	20 lines lol
@sonney2k	but I guess we just stop counting :D
@sonney2k	20 lines only ???
@sonney2k	how come?
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://code.google.com/p/redsvd/source/browse/trunk/src/redsvd.hpp
 heiko	sonney2k, I now added a feed for all entries on the site
 heiko	http://herrstrathmann.de/?format=feed&type=rss
 blackburn	sonney2k: all the method are in lines 50-86
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think all nice stuff is pretty compact
 blackburn	liblinear is small yet efficient as well
@sonney2k	not that small
@sonney2k	heiko, ok I am adding this
 blackburn	sonney2k: liblinear you mean? multiclass is very compact
@sonney2k	heiko, done

 wiking	blackburn1: yo here?
 blackburn1	wiking: yeah
-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
 wiking	so what's with that new lib? :)
 blackburn	wiking: which one?
 wiking	that u were testing yesterday
 blackburn	hmm testing?
 wiking	well yeah
 wiking	that svd stuff
 blackburn	ahhhh
 blackburn	didn't manage to test it yet
 blackburn	wiking: works for gaussian so far, will test on swissroll just in a few minutes I hope
 blackburn	wiking: no it doesn't work :D
 wiking	:D
 wiking	:(

 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you think?
 blackburn	n4nd0: just fix that ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will probably screw it up if I change something of the web :P
 blackburn	I hope you won't :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: my prototype works like gaussian generator
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what does that mean? hehe
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	a bit random?
 n4nd0	:O
 blackburn	yeah it has an answer for the question of universe
 blackburn	gaussian blob that is
 blackburn	n4nd0: I localized the problem though
 n4nd0	good new
 blackburn	eigen brings some pain in ass as well
 blackburn	gaussian generator in da house
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh! I've got a cross scatter plot
 blackburn	may be he wants me to become a christian

 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/fuckthisshit.png
 blackburn	what can I say is that it is not a swissroll embedding yet
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	definitely it is not
 blackburn	I expect something is wrong in eigendecomposion as I fixed weights computation
 blackburn	probably it is a bad idea to start with experimental method
 blackburn	hmmm I must have crazy lapack skills :D
 blackburn	wrapper in 6 minutes
 blackburn	should write a book

 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, around?
 blackburn	ich bin around
 heiko	hallo blackburn, wie gehts? :)
 blackburn	I do know what is the question but no idea how to answer
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn, if I ask a kernel machine to give me its kernel via get_kernel(), and I do this in python, AND I know that this kernel is a Gaussian kernel, how can I call get_width() on it? since get_kernel returns type of CKernel, not CGaussianKernel
 blackburn	for some reason I know ich bin muede
 heiko	blackburn, this was "How are you?" :)
 blackburn	heiko: yes, I know
 blackburn	but no german analogue of 'I'm fine' in my mind
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	ah , sorry, I see
 wiking	heiko: is ther an obtain_from_generic() in CGaussianKernel
 heiko	blackburn: "Gut, Danke!" "I am fine, thanks"
 wiking	heiko: if not then define one
 wiking	and call that from your python code
 blackburn	heiko: you are in wiking 22 situation
 heiko	okay, cool this is exactly I wanted to know
 wiking	blackburn: but he can fix it :)
 blackburn	but wiking 22 is even more tough
 wiking	blackburn: as he has his class defined in c++ ;P
 heiko	blackburn, just wasnt sure whether to use copy constructor or separate method
 blackburn	it is just impossibru
 blackburn	heiko: you have to unfortunately
 blackburn	heiko: stupid stupid python
 heiko	so copy constructor for CGaussianKernel AND obtain from generic, right?
 wiking	you don't need that
 heiko	blackburn, thanks
 wiking	heiko: just define a static function
 wiking	obtain_from_generic
 heiko	wiking, static function?
 wiking	and you're good to go
 wiking	yeah check out other classes how they deal with it
 heiko	wiking, ok, thanks, what is an example?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I've got another cross now with lapack
 heiko	wiking, I just saw dense features
 blackburn	one more patch and I will see jesus
 heiko	but there it is not static
 wiking	heiko: src/shogun/structure/MulticlassSOLabels.h
 heiko	uh
 heiko	annoying,
 wiking	heiko: you can do this with EKernelType
 heiko	wiking, blackburn, we need this for every class, is there some way of not having to implement this all the time? :)
 wiking	heiko: get_kernel_type and then do the typecasting
 blackburn	heiko: I'd like to have one
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	I am lazy
 heiko	this is needed for all models selection classes
 heiko	what about adding this to CKernel?
 blackburn	it is out of OOP to be honest
 wiking	heiko: well that won't help u
 heiko	wiking, and then using copy constructors
 wiking	as u always have to return the right class type
 heiko	yeh
 wiking	heiko: and what's going to be the definition of that function
 wiking	? :)
 wiking	what will it return, CKernel* ?:)
 wiking	because then you are at square one
 heiko	wiking, yeah ........
 heiko	damn :)
 heiko	ok, then, people will have to ask for that everytime they need it
 wiking	heiko: you'll most probably have to define this everywhere
 wiking	but of course
 wiking	you can do a macro hack i think
 wiking	so do this magic with macros
 wiking	and then the macro will generate you the code for compilation
 wiking	or templating ;)
 wiking	yeah templating could work somehow :)
 heiko	wiking, yes, that might be possible, but is even more ugly :D
 heiko	wiking, blackburn, what about reference counting?
 blackburn	heiko: what about
 blackburn	ref counting?
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	this is not done multiclasssolabels
 heiko	no sgref
 heiko	dont we need that
 blackburn	hmm
 heiko	like in get_kernel of kernel machine
 heiko	since it produces a new reference to the object?
 wiking	heiko: no it's just typecasting
 blackburn	heiko: no just typecast for me
 wiking	it doesn't do anything else
 heiko	wiking, but when I do it in python I have two references to the same object
 wiking	but since there's no way you can do typecasting in python
 wiking	you have to do this ugly hack
 heiko	ok then, thanks guys
 wiking	when u do get_kernel() or whatever that'll ++ the refcounter
 blackburn	heiko: interesting point - can you check that?
 heiko	blackburn, how?
 wiking	afaik for a typecast u don't need an extra refcounter on it
 wiking	i certainly don't see a point for it :P
 blackburn	wiking: he means following:
 heiko	I mean actually, an SG_REF would be needed, its needed whenever we produce a new reference to an object
 blackburn	x = get_kernel() <- first appeareance of object
 blackburn	blablakernel.obtain_from_shit(x) <- second one
 blackburn	of the same object
 wiking	blackburn: but that second one should not ++ the refcounter
 wiking	as u essentially just casting there
 blackburn	wiking: it doesn't but after these two lines we have two references
 blackburn	to the same object
 blackburn	but +1 of ref counter only
 wiking	and? :)
 wiking	personally i wouldn't do it
 blackburn	but when they are going to be destructed
 heiko	If I now pass the first object to another place in python
 blackburn	it is -2 for ref counter right?
 heiko	and then the method is exited, then this object I passed on will be destroiyed
 heiko	I mean nobody will do this anyway, but technically, we need another +1 whenever we produce a reference,
 heiko	Doesnt hurt adding it, python will decrease it automatically
 wiking	heiko: yes python
 wiking	not c++
 wiking	hence it'll hurt some other code
 wiking	but if u fix it
 wiking	then go ahead
 wiking	:)
 wiking	i certainly valgrind it
 wiking	as there's already there's some shit already with streamingfeatures
 heiko	but in c++ the agreement is that whenever you get an object, the ref-count is increased
 heiko	see get_kernel() etc
 heiko	also why should one use the method from c++ ?
 wiking	heiko: it's cleaner :))))
 wiking	heiko: and it does a typechecking
 wiking	although of course
 heiko	I would rather do a dynamic_cast
 wiking	in c++ you could try dynamic_cast
 wiking	yes indeed
 wiking	but sonney2k killed me for that one
 heiko	for dynamic casts?
 heiko	why that?
 wiking	when i did it in one of my code
 wiking	yeah he made me remove it :>
 heiko	for what reason?
 heiko	Actually, one doesnt even need a dynamic cast
 heiko	a simple cast is ok
 wiking	shame one cannot search in PRs
 wiking	heiko: well dyncast at least does some checking
 heiko	since the method will throw an error if the type is wrong anyway
 wiking	and it'll throw an exception if u wanna do some nasty shit
 heiko	one should never cast if one isnt sure about the type anyway
 heiko	anyway, different topic :)

 heiko	blackburn, still there?
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 heiko	blackburn, there is a memory bug in CCrossValidationMulticlassStorage
 heiko	blackburn, related to pointers to SgVectors
 heiko	I dont know about this, I think we shold totally avoid these
 heiko	they cause massive trouble on the long run
 blackburn	heiko: like arrays of sgvectors?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	these should not exist in my eyes
 blackburn	hah what to use instead?
 heiko	we have to think of something
 wiking	std::vector<SGVector<> >
 heiko	if we continue like this, we will totally destroy any serialization
 wiking	FTW
 heiko	also its so hard to debug when there is a mixture of auto-ref-counting and these arrays of SGVectors
 heiko	blackburn, I mean usually you know how many vectors you want to have, so just ust a matrix
 blackburn	heiko: SGVector<>[] would work too
 heiko	what about a matrix instead?
 blackburn	it is not always possible
 heiko	And we *definitely* need to think about a data structure that can dynamically handle SGVectors
 heiko	blackburn, but its possible most of the time
 heiko	e.g. in CCrossValidationMulticlassStorage
 blackburn	heiko: std:: vector :D
 heiko	you know how many you store before
 heiko	blackburn, no, so std:: things please
 heiko	think of serialization
 heiko	we *need* a new structure for this
 blackburn	heiko: just copy a std::vector then
 heiko	blackburn, what do you have against a matrix?
 heiko	whats the difference to SGVector<>*
 heiko	?
 blackburn	heiko: nothing I am just unsure it is always possible
 heiko	blackburn, its not - but only if we need dynamic structures
 heiko	in this case SGVector<>* wont help anyway,
 heiko	so we can always avoid it
 heiko	and for the dynamic case, we need something new
 heiko	that can handle SGReferenced data
 heiko	also in the multiclass labels, there we can replace everything by SGMatrices
 heiko	since its not dynamic
 wiking	i need a dynamically resizeable Matrix
 heiko	This way, we ensure that shoguns parameter framework still can handle everything
 wiking	so if u come up with something then plz let me now
 wiking	currently i do
 heiko	wiking, yes I need one too
 wiking	std::vector<SGVector<> >
 blackburn	wiking: EIgen::MatrixXd
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	wiking, please dont use this construction
 wiking	heiko: hehehe yeah that's my solution :)
 wiking	heiko: why not? :)
 wiking	worksforme
 wiking	:D
 wiking	but i know that it's not allowed in shogun
 wiking	hence i haven't commited the code
 heiko	wiking, you will kill shogun :(
 heiko	*poor shogun*
 wiking	blackburn: ok so we are going with hard-linking to Eigen3? :)
 wiking	i have nothing against it  :D
 blackburn	wiking: you know I have nothing against anything ;D
 heiko	blackburn, could you have a look in http://pastebin.com/fyCnxHxc ?
 heiko	this reproduces the bug I mentioned
 blackburn	heiko: man it is big, what is the bug?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	just run with valgrind
 heiko	memory bug in the CrossValidationMulticlassStorage
 blackburn	heiko: can you line me up?
 heiko	blackburn, private msgs got throttled :)
 heiko	the bug happens in destructor of the class
 blackburn	heiko: yeah I've got a message
 heiko	just run valgrind and you will see
 blackburn	heiko: I just talked to gsomix
 blackburn	he is 2 meters far away
 blackburn	you thing can be solved other way
 heiko	blackburn, send him my greetings
 heiko	blackburn, im curious :)
 blackburn	python_modular/swig_typemaps.i:825
 blackburn	greetings in return heh
 blackburn	heiko: that maps features to its actual type
 heiko	ah that is related to the obtain_from_generic thing right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	not that storage shit :D
 heiko	ok, so you think the other problem can be solved using a similar concept?
 blackburn	kernel problem should be solved
 heiko	blackburn, yes, nice idea
 heiko	blackburn, is gsomix interested in implementing that? :D
 blackburn	heiko: not now but he could
 heiko	blackburn, great then! :)
 heiko	blackburn, about that storage shit
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	I think we should change things asap
 heiko	otherwise, we will collect more and more
 heiko	also get rid of using std::vector whereever its possible
 heiko	The whole parameter framework becomes obsolete if we dont do this
 blackburn	heiko: one example
 blackburn	confusion matrices
 blackburn	how to store array of confusion matrices?
 heiko	blackburn, yes good point
 heiko	We need a structure for these SGReferenced objects
 blackburn	dynamic?
 heiko	where we pass by reference
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	why by reference?
 heiko	because that is the way the SG* are handled
 heiko	otherwise we could just derive from SGObject
 heiko	and handle it like other shogun classes
 heiko	but the whole point was not doing that
 blackburn	ehmm we can pass it by value with no problem
 heiko	ah
 heiko	sorry
 heiko	I meant that
 heiko	but not by pointer
 heiko	and then we can make this structure serializable and we are done
 wiking	http://www.welovetheherb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Fuck-This-Shit-Get-The-Bong.jpg
 wiking	indee
 wiking	d
 blackburn	wiking: yes
 heiko	wiking :D
 heiko	but seriously - this has to be changed, we will also get rid of debugging errors like the one in CCrossValidationMulticlassStorage
 wiking	heiko: no worries i was talking 'bout my work
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	heiko: can you see anything wrong in that storage?
 heiko	blackburn, I will take a look
 blackburn	I am in  eigenfighting now :D
 wiking	Yo trabajo sin reposo
 wiking	!!!
 blackburn	wiking: chego?
 wiking	fuckthisshittime
 wiking	with buena vista social club ;)
 wiking	how the fuck is it possible
 wiking	that i get the same PO
 wiking	with C=1 and C=150
 wiking	does not compile
 heiko	blackburn, m_fold_ROC_graphs is not initialized
 heiko	setting it to NULL in the constructor solves the problem here
 blackburn	heiko: i see
 heiko	I will correct and push
 blackburn	thanks
 heiko	blackburn, any ideas for a SGReferenced structure?
 blackburn	heiko: no not really we will imitate std::vector in the end :D
 heiko	blackburn, what about somehow being able to use the existing data structures for that -- since they already work fine
 blackburn	heiko: which?
 heiko	CDynamicObject, CList, etc
 blackburn	dynamicobjectshit should work
 heiko	huh? how ?
 heiko	It accepts CSGObject* only
 blackburn	ahh

@sonney2k	whats up here?
 heiko	sonney2k, hi there :)
@sonney2k	wiking, I asked you to use obtain_from_generic instead of dynamic cast (it will catch error situations)...
@sonney2k	IIRC
@sonney2k	heiko, what are you trying to emulate?
 heiko	sonney2k, what do you mean?
@sonney2k	I think we are just fine with any SGVector[] or whatever as long as we don't need them as parameters / ms-parameters
@sonney2k	actually any data structure is fine as long as we don't need to serialize it / use it in MS
 heiko	sonney2k, indeed
 heiko	sonney2k, but actually many places where these are used are cases where they are parameters
 heiko	for example multiclass labels
@sonney2k	I am wondering a bit whether gsomix managed to do some hackery to always return the correct type from python...
 heiko	currently completely non-serializable
 heiko	sonney2k, another downside in my eyes is that using SGVector[] is a step back to where we came from before SGVectors were around
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah but this case would have worked with SGMatrix w/o problems
 heiko	sonney2k, yes true, actually most places will work with matrix
@sonney2k	heiko, true
@sonney2k	we of course have SGStringList
 heiko	sonney2k, what about if one needs multiple matrices
@sonney2k	that is basically doing that
@sonney2k	you can have vectors of arbitrary mixed lengths
@sonney2k	multiple matrices - SGNDArray
@sonney2k	but fixed length again
 heiko	which is not implemented anywhere
@sonney2k	heiko, you mean serialization is not but NDArray is
@sonney2k	heiko, serialization for SGNDArray is easy though (if you have it working for SGVector)
 heiko	sonney2k, true
@sonney2k	it is just a flat data structure like SGVector/Matrix
@sonney2k	heiko, we don't have stringlist serialization do we?
 heiko	sonney2, actually dynamic structures are not that much needed since one could just use a std:: structure and then write back to a fixed SG structure afterwards
@sonney2k	heiko, and SGSparseMatrix serialization?
 heiko	but I am not aware of any case where a parameter is a dynamic thing
@sonney2k	well a list of strings - but that currently is only used in features
@sonney2k	actually we might need to rename SGString to sth SGVariableLengthArrays or so
 heiko	yes maybe
@sonney2k	SGStringList I mean
 heiko	yes
 heiko	would be nice, to make it more "visible"
 heiko	sonney2k, I am curious about this SGNDArray
 heiko	is this actually working?
 heiko	because then, transition from SGMatrix[] to a SG-parameter would be quite easy
@sonney2k	heiko, it is used in structured output stuff
 heiko	wow didnt know
 wiking	sonney2k: as dyncast catch as well errors... or?
@sonney2k	heiko, well not the new one some old one
@sonney2k	wiking, no dyncast will not throw a shogun exception but just return NULL
 heiko	sonney2k, do you got a class name for that?
 wiking	sonney2k: but nevermind i was just saying to heiko that dyncast is out of scope:>
@sonney2k	wiking, so you might get crashes / have to check manually
@sonney2k	heiko, for what?
 heiko	sonney2k, for the SO NGNDArray
 heiko	sonney2k, I use dynamic_cast sometimes exactly because of this nice thing that you can check for NULL
 wiking	hahahah my machine give always +1 as prediction label :)
 blackburn	wiking: positive guy
 wiking	yeah amazing shit
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah but if you expect a certain type at a particular location in the code than there is no use - you will have to throw an exception anyway. that is why we wrote the obtain_from_generic * stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, congratulations - I bet I could have learned sth like that *even* faster
 wiking	sonney2k: :>>>
@sonney2k	heiko,
 heiko	sonney2k, ok, well my need of this had a different motivation

@sonney2k	shogun/structure/PlifMatrix.h
@sonney2k	shogun/structure/DynProg.h
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah it took me 3000secs to learn this w :D
@sonney2k	heiko, so n4nd0 is using it too
@sonney2k	wiking, w might be ok just b not
 wiking	sonney2k: nah i'm reading now the w from a file.... and the other code does better, so i think my port of the problem is buggy
 heiko	sonney2k, cool thanks
 blackburn	LOL
 blackburn	G = [ 44.7894 -3.80941  30.9719
 blackburn	-3.80941  24.3547 -24.1039
 blackburn	 30.9719 -24.1039  48.6117]
 blackburn	best gram matrix ever
 heiko	blackburn, so all the SGVector[] can be replaced by SGMatrix and SGMatrix[] can be replaced by SGNArray, and then we can register the things as parameters again
 blackburn	heiko: go for it :D
 heiko	blackburn, this was more to keep in mind for new code :D
 heiko	like new model selection storage classes
 blackburn	I wish I didn't create that class
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn, lazy guy :D
 heiko	sonney2k, have I told you about my new job already?
 heiko	cant remember if you were there last time ... ?
@sonney2k	heiko, no what is it?
@sonney2k	heiko, btw SGSparseMatrix and SGStringList also need to be supported by serialization
@sonney2k	I think they are not yet
 heiko	sonney2k, I will work on GP classification at uni, and since the guys are keen on an implementation, I convinced them that I do that for shogun
 heiko	its gonna be some fancy stuff
 heiko	with advanced MCMC for redictive distribution integrals and hyperparameter learning
 heiko	so I will extend the GP framework with all that stuff
 heiko	and get paid for it :)
 heiko	sonney2k, oh and since its a collaboration with a company who needs that for some quality testing on welds, they will use shogun for it
 blackburn	just to check my mind
 blackburn	linear kernel can't be negative right?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn, [-1, -1] * [1,1]
 blackburn	ehmm
 heiko	or what do you mean?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no mercer kernel should be - though there are numerical issues sometimes
 blackburn	so scalar product can be negative :D
 blackburn	I was confused but it is ok right?
@sonney2k	heiko, excellent?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes should be posdef but can contain negative elements?
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, not on diagonal though :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah they are norms
@sonney2k	except for floatingpoint issues
@sonney2k	never underestimate the power of floats
* sonney2k argh I couldn't resist - another 4 discus fish are now in the tank
 blackburn	sonney2k: haha
@sonney2k	Madeira-Merah Discus - http://easydiskus.de/madeira-merah/
 heiko	sonney2k, these cool pretty cool :)
 heiko	didnt know you were into that
@sonney2k	I hope they survive
@sonney2k	if they all do this night - then good
 heiko	hehe wont they got eaten by their small fellows?
@sonney2k	heiko, what?
 heiko	these small ones on the pictures
@sonney2k	heiko, ahh no babies rarely eat their parents :P
@sonney2k	but mine are not yet that old
 heiko	your babies are not that old to eat you? :D
@sonney2k	discus fish can live pretty long - up to age 16 years(!)
@sonney2k	heiko, I hope so
@sonney2k	and actually that they never attempt that!
@sonney2k	the ones here are < 1 year
@sonney2k	but >12 cm already
@sonney2k	not yet pizza size but close to
 heiko	wow pretty big
@sonney2k	and strong ones too
@sonney2k	only issue is that each one carries different bacteria - so when one has bad luck everyone is dead in the end
@sonney2k	(by end of tomorrow)
@sonney2k	heiko, btw you are actually partially right - baby discus feed from the skin of their parents in the first days
@sonney2k	an parents change color to dark brown
@sonney2k	and babys go for everything dark
 heiko	sonney2k, hehe, cool guys you got there.
@sonney2k	heiko, how long will your new contract last?
 heiko	sonney2k, ~6 months
@sonney2k	cool
 heiko	yeh, looking pretty forward to it
@sonney2k	heiko, wish we could generate such kind of jobs
 heiko	In general, to learn about GPs in detail
 heiko	sonney2k, the original job description was:
@sonney2k	heiko, ask oliver stegle about stuff - he really knows his way around (Jacobs mentor that is)
 heiko	come up with GP for multiclass classification (they already had GP and MCMC in mind), implement sophisticated software (should be usable by company), and write paper
 heiko	sonney2k, cool thanks for the tip
 heiko	sonney2k, btw you forwarded my email to gunnar some time ago, remmeber?
 heiko	Philipp Drewe got back to me and we did something together
@sonney2k	I don't even remember
 heiko	sonney2k, well thanks anyway :)
@sonney2k	heiko, btw we need to start the billing stuff soon
 blackburn	sonney2k: heiko: I am not going to make my docs in time :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, how do you know?
 blackburn	sonney2k: will receive my foreign passport after 13th of november
 blackburn	they scheduled it already
 heiko	sonney2k, ok thats fine here
 blackburn	sonney2k: -> less than 2 weeks to get american visa
 heiko	blackburn 13 november? isnt that fine?
 heiko	ah, fuck you need a visa
 heiko	damn :(
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, well we can still try no?
 heiko	I will fly to Germany next week to get an express passport (otherwise I also need visa)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't mind I just let you know as I received a notification
@sonney2k	blackburn, erm the doc summit starts on dec 3 right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: right
@sonney2k	so about 3 weeks
@sonney2k	for visa
 blackburn	not clear, I will receive passport *after* 13th
@sonney2k	heiko, I guess I have to do the job anyways anyways
@sonney2k	blackburn, I see
 blackburn	so 2 weeks for visa in best case
 heiko	sonney2k, just let me know, I am quite flexible with time currently since no deadlines for the first time in ages :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: funny thing I'd have to go to moscow for an interview
 heiko	blackburn, time you move to europa :)
 blackburn	so would require 2 days out
@sonney2k	heiko, I forgot what I had to do last time but it could be that I do it and you will only notice once the money arrived :D
 heiko	sonney2k, ok then tell me before I accidentially spend it on stuff ;)
@sonney2k	heiko, I will make you swallow some gps to track you :D
 heiko	hehe :)
 heiko	no worries about that
 heiko	I quit all my drug addictions :D
 wiking	docsdocsdocs
 wiking	blackburn: let's just forge u a passport that doesn'tneed visa to the states :
 blackburn	wiking: passport of united states you mean?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	do you know a guy to do that?
 wiking	mmm guess there's always a guy :)))
 wiking	u need like a low profile passport
@sonney2k	except that they will chop of your head if they recognize
 wiking	like a slovakian one
 wiking	couple of bottles of good vodka should fix u up with one :P
 heiko	sonney2k, btw what about this live pdf of the shogun-tutorial?
 wiking	blackburn: once i've heard that a bunch of guys who were maintaining/upgrading the database of citizens in new zealand got into trouble: somebody from the authorities realised that there were more rows in the new table than in the old one :DD
 blackburn	hahah
 wiking	blackburn: they confiscated all team members' passport and nobody was allowed to leave the country until the investigation finished
 wiking	that was around xmas
 wiking	so a collegue's brother couldn't come back for xmas holidays as he was part of the team :D
@sonney2k	wiking, nice
 wiking	must be funny to add yourself a row in that table :)))
@sonney2k	heiko, well we generate the doxygen doc only currently (but only if nightly_default works !)
@sonney2k	heiko, surely we could do the .pdf too
 heiko	sonney2k, is it hard to add the latex to the nightly build?
 wiking	blackburn: u need to do something like this :)))
 wiking	blackburn: insert into citizen :D
 blackburn	wiking: I'm just searching a way to do an sql injection
 wiking	blackburn: ahhahahaha
 wiking	or like get maltese citizenship
 wiking	i bet that they have low security going on :)))
 blackburn	wiking: there was a case recently
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you are lucky the same people that administrate sony's servers are taking care :D
 wiking	sonney2k: :D
@sonney2k	heiko, no - easy
 blackburn	wiking: pope riding a bmw car with maltese plates bammed into a few cars
 heiko	sonney2k, would be awesome to have in my eyes - there could be a link on the shogun website
@sonney2k	heiko, btw did you twitter?
 blackburn	he was also drunk (nice addition
 heiko	sonney2k, yes
 wiking	blackburn: :>>>
@sonney2k	heiko, cool :D
 wiking	blackburn: which pope?
 blackburn	wiking: not guilty in the end
 blackburn	wiking: argh priest may be?
 wiking	blackburn: ah ok :>
 blackburn	wiking: you know I am stupid with owrds :D
 wiking	pope is the head of the church :>
 blackburn	wiking: so orthodox priest
 blackburn	wiking: ??? in russian is a priest
 blackburn	so got confused
 heiko	sonney2k, btw I am also not a twitter person ;) my girlfriend had to explain it to me
@sonney2k	heiko, I am totally ignorant of all blogging / twittering etc
@sonney2k	I hate doing publicity
@sonney2k	but it is a necessary evil
@sonney2k	takes me lot of time I cannot to reasonable things
 heiko	sonney2k, same here, but its quite handy for this scientific networking
 heiko	sonney2k, lol, I did not even do my webpage myself :D
 wiking	sonney2k: can we add a RT rule to shogun's twitter acc?
 wiking	like if it sees #shogun then RT it? :)
 heiko	wiking, I just got an introduction into that, and these hashs #
 wiking	ok bad idea
 wiking	https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shogun&src=typd
 wiking	#shogun-toolbox maybe then :)
 heiko	wiking, phew, I forgot it this time :)
 heiko	so  better not do that
 heiko	mayne shogun-toolbox
@sonney2k	wiking, luckily not :)
 wiking	sonney2k: as i see that shoguntoolbox has some followers
 wiking	and instead of trying to do some co-tweeting
 wiking	just retweet if some-of-us mentions #shogun-toolbox in their tweet or soemthing
@sonney2k	wiking, I haven't used twitter at all - so totally clueless. Just created that account and uploaded a picture. Now I am hoping that heiko, n4nd0, blackburn fill in some content
-shogungit:#shogun- [shogun] sonney2k pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/915af5cda5ab6c46a5cddb04fa993ff4b9651cc0
-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 915af5c Soeren Sonnenburg: add make tutorial target
 wiking	sonney2k: ic
 wiking	blackburn: twitbot? :)
@sonney2k	heiko, wiking btw if we manage to get in gsoc next year and you intend to mentor - I've met some projects who had ~4 people attending
 heiko	sonney2k, 4 people at once in one project you mean?
 wiking	attending the summit?
@sonney2k	yes. only problem will be flight costs I guess
 heiko	ah the mentor summit?
 heiko	nice :)
 wiking	btw sonney2k dont u wanna get the travis fixed
 wiking	so it tries all the interfaces?
@sonney2k	I am not sure how much google covers then... they did cover 2 hotel nights and IIRC up to 2k$ for flights
@sonney2k	wiking, you are the travis hero
 wiking	hah
 wiking	donthavetime
@sonney2k	I have no clue about it (never even looked at it)
@sonney2k	wiking, and btw also the unit tests stuff
 wiking	someobody should smartly define ENV variables
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do they choose # of mentors to arrive?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i've started it but i'm quite busy with all the latent coding/fixing
 wiking	heiko: what's your twitter acc?
@sonney2k	wiking, if it helps blackburn creates a ticket and assigns it to you :D
 heiko	wiking, dont have
 wiking	heiko: ic
@sonney2k	blackburn, they have the rule 2 persons per project
 wiking	sonney2k: :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, and then there is a waiting list
 wiking	sonney2k: have u closed the SA ticket? :)))))
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh
@sonney2k	so some projects might not want to send 2
 wiking	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/789
 wiking	sonney2k: u can close it :)
 blackburn	argh this week I am going to receive reject (or accept if I am lucky)
