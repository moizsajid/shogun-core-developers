 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
@wiking	sanuj: what'sup
 sanuj	wiking, for the shogun-base list
 sanuj	i grepped "()=0" or "() = 0"
 sanuj	for pure virtual functions
 sanuj	to find abstract classes
 sanuj	one of the classes is MulticlassMachine.h
 sanuj	and the class hierarchy goes like CMulticlassMachine --> CBaseMulticlassMachine --> CMachine --> CSGObject
 sanuj	wiking, then shall i add all these classes to the base-shogun list?
@wiking	mmm
 sanuj	yes/no?
@wiking	just checking
@wiking	to see what's the diff
@wiking	between CBaseMulticlassMachine and toCMulticlassMachine
 sanuj	okay :)
 sanuj	are you back in Singapore?
@wiking	do
@wiking	h
@wiking	i mean not yet :)
@wiking	whoa this i dont understand
@wiking	but ok this is a bit unrelated
@wiking	but yeah the idea is that abstract classes are actually just interfaces
@wiking	for the implementations
@wiking	these interfaces should all be included in the shogun-base
@wiking	sanuj: but this CMulticlassMachine --> CBaseMulticlassMachine
@wiking	troubles me a bit
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	but will check out with others on the mailinglist
 sanuj	but all abstract classes don't have pure virtual functions
@wiking	abstract class = pure virtual functions
@wiking	;)
@wiking	that's the definition of abstract class in c++
@wiking	"Classes derived from the abstract class must implement the pure virtual function or they, too, are abstract classes. A virtual function is declared as "pure" by using the pure-specifier syntax (described in Class Protocol Implementation). Consider the example presented in Virtual Functions."
@wiking	sanuj: ^
@wiking	ok?
 sanuj	wiking, yes i know that
 sanuj	but we would be adding CMachine to the list right?
 sanuj	but it's not abstract i.e. no pure virtual function
 sanuj	wiking, what do you reckon ^
@wiking	yes we need to add the classes who are the parents of the classes that you wanna add to the shogun-base :)
@wiking	like SGObject
@wiking	etc
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	wiking, also i have swig interface working for my tag prototype
@wiking	cool!
 sanuj	what shall i do next for the tag prototype
@wiking	so
@wiking	now the question is how to create the whole new plugins arch
 sanuj	wiking, i think we need to add this tag prototype in dynaplugz
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	as well as start to define
@wiking	shogun-base
@wiking	with tag prototype + dynaplugz
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	wiking, we can incrementally add classes to shogun-base right?
@wiking	yeah but
@wiking	the thing is that we need to do this
@wiking	as part of shogun repo
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	on a different branch?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	i mean fork the repo
@wiking	start a new branch
@wiking	and work on that
 sanuj	so first lets make dynaplugz + tags work separately before forking

@wiking	ok this one failed as well :)
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has joined #shogun
@wiking	mizari: good tld
@wiking	where did you get it? :)
 mizari	hi
 mizari	whats tld? :)
@wiking	.su
@wiking	that's the tld for soviet union :)
 mizari	I dont know what tld stands for
 mizari	if you're about @95-174-213-100.nts.su in my whois, then I got it from my internet provider
 mizari	which is in Russia
 mizari	top-level domain?
@wiking	woah
@wiking	your internet provider is super cool
@wiking	:)))
 sanuj	wiking, do we have a design draft for plugins also? :)
@wiking	mmm not really
 mizari	thanks, I'll convey them your message
@wiking	wanna write one?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, yooooo
@wiking	sanuj: but again
@wiking	shogun base should be the first thing
@wiking	you define
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking, i'm trying to understand how to write a plugin architecture for c++
@wiking	ah
@wiking	dyload :)
@wiking	dlopen
@wiking	sanuj: but again
@wiking	you'll need to write
@wiking	a brand new stuff
@wiking	for shogun-base
@wiking	a config file support
@wiking	because there the user should be able to set
@wiking	a lot of things
@wiking	for example where it should look for the dynamic libraries
@wiking	available to load in
 sanuj	wiking, tell me the things i should read
 sanuj	i'm not really a c++ magician like lisitsyn or besser82_
@wiking	ok so you should read about shared libraries
@wiking	i.e. man dlopen
@wiking	and again
 mizari	is dlopen cross-platform?
@wiking	*nix wise yes
 mizari	okie
@wiking	sanuj: but again as said write a simple config file support
@wiking	sanuj: something like
@wiking	sanuj: key=value
 lisitsyn	what config file?
@wiking	lisitsyn: because how else we gonna be able to support the override of plugin location as well as set what linalg backend one would like shogun to use
@wiking	so some global params
@wiking	that you dont want to set programatically all the time
@wiking	arghfuck
 lisitsyn	mizari: is it tomsk online?
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	how is this possible
@wiking	#define EIGEN_WORLD_VERSION 3
@wiking	#define EIGEN_MAJOR_VERSION 2
@wiking	#define EIGEN_MINOR_VERSION 92
@wiking	ii  libeigen3-dev               3.3~beta1-2                     all          lightweight C++ template library for linear algebra
@wiking	damn eigen ppl
 lisitsyn	wiking: not eigen
 lisitsyn	ubuntu
@wiking	what ?D
 mizari	lisitsyn: yeah, Tomsk's New Telesystems
@wiking	lisitsyn: it isn't 3.3 ?:)
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah but I guess ubuntu people screwed
@wiking	i mean how? :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: well packaged it with the wrong name
@wiking	no
@wiking	it's actually 3.3
@wiking	src
@wiking	lisitsyn: if you download the 3.3beta1 src
@wiking	you'll get the same
 lisitsyn	wiking: ah ok
@HeikoS	wiking, lisitsyn
@HeikoS	jo
@HeikoS	about the summit, I think you guys should go
@HeikoS	make sure all is organised as early as possible
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: especially your visa
@HeikoS	we can change names until last minute, so no risk of loosing a place
@HeikoS	and if you change mind, let me know ;D
@wiking	lisitsyn: did you fix the static assertation error in tapkee by any chance for 3.3?
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@host-92-0-162-192.as43234.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@wiking	or have you actually seen it?
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://pastebin.com/LGqQphNc
 lisitsyn	wiking: ahh yes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I can apply soon
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes easy to fix
@wiking	lisitsyn: cool, if you gimme hints i can do it if you dont have time... or when can you haz it?
@wiking	i have another error in shogun
@wiking	so i'm gonna fix that now
@wiking	btw
@wiking	3.2.91 <= version is 3.3
@wiking	:)
@wiking	EIGEN_VERSION_AT_LEAST(3, 2, 91) macro should work
 sanuj	wiking, config file is where version variables are defined for cmake?
@wiking	no
@wiking	it's a config file for the library itself
 sanuj	you are talking about this dlopen?
 sanuj	http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen
@wiking	yes
 sanuj	wiking, does shogun currently have a similar config file?
@wiking	noup
 sanuj	wiking, can you give me an example for this config flie
@wiking	foo=bar
@wiking	it's a simple properties file
 sanuj	just a simple hpp with key=value pairs?
@wiking	no it's not a hpp
@wiking	its just a simple txt file
@wiking	with lines like 'a=b'
@wiking	or 'key=value'
@wiking	and create an object
@wiking	that stores those (key, value) tuples
@wiking	like in an unordered map or something
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	:D
 lisitsyn	sry
 lisitsyn	what config?!
 sanuj	:P
 sanuj	dlopen() will be used for loading plugins?
 lisitsyn	yes on linux
 sanuj	lisitsyn, for other os?
 lisitsyn	it is different on windows :)
 lisitsyn	but we don't work with windows yet anyway
 lisitsyn	wiking: would you bother?
 sanuj	will work on mac osx
 sanuj	since its unix
@wiking	lisitsyn: yep can check
@wiking	sanuj: concentrate on dlopen
@wiking	no need to get lost on portability for now
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i thought dynaplugz would have some plugins
 sanuj	it just instantiates objects of cdynaplugz
 sanuj	has anyone seen the code?
 lisitsyn	I didn't
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you can check dlopen in aer
 sanuj	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/dynaplugz/blob/develop/src/dynaplugz/dynaplugz.cpp
 sanuj	lisitsyn, thanks :D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what exactly is aer?
@wiking	sanuj: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer
 sanuj	cool c++ designing
 sanuj	no i know the link
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer/blob/master/src/aer/dynamic/library.cpp
 sanuj	what does it stand for
 lisitsyn	sanuj: dynaplugz looks like a dummy
 sanuj	lisitsyn, dynaplugz was mentioned in my gsoc wiki page
 sanuj	should have put aer
 sanuj	it has everything i need
 sanuj	took any from here
 sanuj	(or codeproject.com)
 lisitsyn	yes it is a working prototype for plugins :)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, didn't you implement tags in aer
 sanuj	why reinvent the wheel
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no, that was missed
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	now i'm substituting dynaplugz by aer for all my plans :P
 sanuj	lisitsyn, obj.get("num").asInt() is also working in my tags prototype
 sanuj	do you want anything else?
 lisitsyn	I think that's it for now, plugins are interesting now
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i'll understand aer
 sanuj	lisitsyn,  then shall we put tags in aer?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no
 lisitsyn	just use it as a reference
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	then we will purge it
 sanuj	don't understand what you said
 sanuj	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer/blob/master/src/aer/base/tag.hpp
 sanuj	only swig interface was missing then
@wiking	arianepaola: ping
 lisitsyn	sanuj: aer is just a mapping of my idea to C++ code :D
 lisitsyn	but you just take related parts
 lisitsyn	then we will remove that at all
@wiking	lisitsyn: some 90s music : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrjX2-4sB_4
@wiking	from 2015 :P
 sanuj	lisitsyn, cool

 lisitsyn	about your inquiry

 lisitsyn	I can take care of that rather soon

 lisitsyn	it sounds good

@wiking	HeikoS: so there's a diff but it's quite minor
@wiking	HeikoS: SGObject.equals does not allow error right?
@wiking	ah no it has
@wiking	:)
@wiking	HeikoS: 10E-8 should be good enough precision no?
@HeikoS	wiking: it does
@HeikoS	yeah 1e-8 is good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: great!
@HeikoS	do it :)

@wiking	HeikoS: ^
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: website? :D
 lisitsyn	uh
@wiking	lisitsyn:
@wiking	so what do you think about the release buildbot job?
@wiking	i was thinking that every/any push to master
@wiking	would trigger that job
 lisitsyn	what runs the job?
@wiking	change in the master branch
@wiking	so any push to master
@wiking	will trigger that job
@wiking	any concerns?
 lisitsyn	no I mean
 lisitsyn	is it buildbot job?
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	I think it is good
@wiking	lisitsyn: do you think it's good or not safe or something?
 lisitsyn	I am ok
@wiking	k
@wiking	thnx
@wiking	HeikoS: ok i've set up the trigger for zenodo for the doi
@wiking	so the next release will trigger the doi creation
@wiking	lol
@wiking	why is the 4.1.0 release a Draft?
@wiking	haha it wasn't ever published
@wiking	HeikoS: :)
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.5.121] has joined #shogun
@wiking	HeikoS: so you'll get a doi just in a second
@wiking	ok so people of shogun
@wiking	let me introduce you to
@wiking	http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51537
@wiking	:)))
 lisitsyn	haha
@wiking	ok so it's done
 lisitsyn	how can I set my affiliation
@wiking	thnx to HeikoS who forgot to publish the
@wiking	release
@wiking	lisitsyn: it took it from github
@wiking	afaik
 lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	wiking: what did I break? :D
@wiking	HeikoS: didn't break
@wiking	you prepared nicely the release on github
@wiking	but it was a draft
@wiking	you did not release it
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	lol
@HeikoS	really?
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	cant remember
@wiking	but now it's ok
@HeikoS	well thanks for doing that
@wiking	because this way we have a doi
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	the doi looks nice
@HeikoS	awe-some!
@HeikoS	will cite that instead of paper
@HeikoS	well
@wiking	\o/
@HeikoS	the code is in feature branch
@HeikoS	hehe
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	you'll have a chance to update the article?
@wiking	i mean this is just submission deadline now?
@wiking	because by then we'll have 4.2.0 release
@wiking	and if you merge the feature branch then you can update the doi
@wiking	;P
@wiking	(tricks of publishing 101)
@wiking	HeikoS: is Rahul around you?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	wiking: well the feature branch doesnt fullfull some shogun standards yet
@HeikoS	would be cool to have that
@wiking	well anyhow
@HeikoS	but I think we will just wait until we are done, and then put the DOI in for that
@HeikoS	NIPS takes like 6 months after submission before there is a final version online
@HeikoS	plenty of time
@wiking	yep
@wiking	you can even have the doi for the post gsoc release :)
@HeikoS	I still want to update the JMLR
@HeikoS	yeah ;)
 lisitsyn	update?
@HeikoS	like re-submit
@HeikoS	new author list
@HeikoS	and maybe some more modern content ;)
 lisitsyn	is it possible?
@HeikoS	the old one has 200+ citations
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  yes I think if new stuff is in
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jo
@HeikoS	question:
@HeikoS	how to tell shogun the number of threads to use in openmp?
@HeikoS	because get_global_parallel->set_num_threads() doesnt do it
@HeikoS	wiking: or you know that?
@wiking	you can set an env var
@wiking	OMP_NUM_THREADS
@wiking	but i guess we should update set_num_threads :)
@wiking	to support openmp
@wiking	as well
@HeikoS	wiking: yes that would be the solution right?
@wiking	you mean ?
@HeikoS	#ifdef USE_OPENMP
@HeikoS	omp_set_num_threads(4);
@HeikoS	#endif
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	inside the set_num_threads
@wiking	i mean no
@HeikoS	of Parallel
@wiking	but something like this :)
@wiking	dont fix it to 4
@wiking	:P
@HeikoS	why not? :D
@HeikoS	void Parallel::set_num_threads(int32_t n)
@HeikoS	{
@HeikoS	#ifndef HAVE_PTHREAD
@HeikoS	ASSERT(n==1)
@HeikoS	#endif
@HeikoS	num_threads=n;
@HeikoS	look what I found :)
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	#ifndef
@HeikoS	I thought this was #ifdef
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	Kernel.cpp explicitly asks Parallel for number of threads btw
@HeikoS	and then create pthreads stuff with that number
@HeikoS	but well
@HeikoS	thanks
