 CaBa	ping
 CaBa	wiking: are you around by any chance?
@wiking	yep
 CaBa	wiking: I want to make parameters available to MS for a kernel already in shogun
 CaBa	wiking: what does the MS availability tag do?
 CaBa	wiking: i just looked into other kernels to check how this is implemented usually
@wiking	there's the ms_available or something flag
 CaBa	yes... there is MS_AVAILABLE / MS_UNAVAILABLE
 CaBa	there is also something like GRADIENT_AVAILABLE...
 CaBa	WeightedDegreeRBFKerne <- i need the parametrs "width" and "degree" exposed to MS :)
 CaBa	i recall it says something in the docs "if you miss parameters, just call shogun customer support" :)))
