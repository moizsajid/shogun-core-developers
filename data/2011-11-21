@sonney2k	blackburn1, you should really post such things to the mailinglist...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes but is there anyone who can help?
@sonney2k	even if not it is better to have a) traffic on the list b) to have a public reference for s.o. trying to do the same c) someone posting the solution
@sonney2k	helping in private is not as good
 blackburn1	sonney2k: then can you please answer on mailing list?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, I have errors running running preprocessor_kernelpca .. ERROR

@sonney2k	error in ./preprocessor_kernelpc
@sonney2k	a
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes I know
@sonney2k	did you remove the file?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: which??
@sonney2k	preprocessor_kernelpca*
 blackburn1	ehh?
 blackburn1	I didn't
@sonney2k	did you forget to commit it?
@sonney2k	it is mentioned in the makefile but doesn't exist here
 blackburn1	sonney2k: oh
 blackburn1	fuck
 blackburn1	you're damn smart
 blackburn1	while i'm not
 blackburn1	sure
@sonney2k	mkl regression can only work with svmlight
 blackburn1	sonney2k: and?
@sonney2k	and mkl norm >1
 CIA-37	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r5e4eb1a / examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile : Removed kpca test from makefile - http://git.io/699K-A
 blackburn1	sonney2k: but shouldn't it crash with segfaults and so on?
@sonney2k	it doesnt
@sonney2k	it complains
@sonney2k	MKL-direct: p = 2.000
@sonney2k	MKL-direct: nofKernelsGood = 2
@sonney2k	MKL-direct: Z = inf
@sonney2k	MKL-direct: eps = 1.000000e-02

@sonney2k	MKL-direct: sqrt(preR/p) = -nan
@sonney2k	MKL-direct: R = -nan
@sonney2k	[ERROR] Assertion R >= 0 failed!
@sonney2k	and fails correctly
@sonney2k	but still sth is looking weird
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what is the fucking way to get it instead of SHOGUNEXCEPTION?
@sonney2k	didn't test this here with regression
@sonney2k	not just call init_shogun with no arguments
@sonney2k	but proper string functions
@sonney2k	or call init_shogun_with_defaults
 blackburn1	sonney2k: do you have dropbox?
 blackburn1	I shared a folder
@sonney2k	are the matrices you create proper positive definite?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: no they aren't
 blackburn1	pos semidef I would say?
 blackburn1	(i-j)^2
@sonney2k	so lets add sth to the diag
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I did
 blackburn1	1e38 should be enough?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: did you receive MKLRegressionPython folder?
@sonney2k	not the problem
 blackburn1	sonney2k: not the problem what?
@sonney2k	the example doesn't even work with CLibSVR
 blackburn1	sonney2k: and what to do?
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	ahh the SG_UNREF stuff was wrong
 blackburn1	sonney2k: more I do shogun more I do not understand
@sonney2k	you forget to SG_REF the objects you later want to still use
@sonney2k	rule is - you need to SG_REF any object that you want to use later
 blackburn1	why not to SG_REF on creation?
@sonney2k	otherwise putting the object into any shogun function will make shogun take care of it incl. destruction
 blackburn1	sonney2k:
 blackburn1	did
 blackburn1	you
 blackburn1	receive
 blackburn1	python script
 blackburn1	it is more important cause it crashes
@sonney2k	blackburn1, I did not check / doesn't help with the problem
 blackburn1	I thought you know more :D
 blackburn1	sonney2k: with "defaults" I obtained it is a index error in .py script
 blackburn1	ok ok
@sonney2k	ok at least libsvr /svrlight work with this script now
 blackburn1	sonney2k: is it working now?
 blackburn1	that 'smoke' test?
 blackburn1	could you please commit hen
 blackburn1	then
@sonney2k	it works with svrlight/libsvm but not mkl
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what is the purpose of this test then?
@sonney2k	mkl classification works too with that
@sonney2k	this works for me https://gist.github.com/1383965
 blackburn1	sonney2k: regression?
@sonney2k	anyway need to sleep now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn1	hah
 blackburn1	ok
 blackburn1	see you
