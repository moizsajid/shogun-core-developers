 USC	hello all
 USC	how are you
 USC	?
 USC	anybody alive?
 USC	I need MATLAB mex files for Shogun Toolbox
 USC	anybody has it?
-!- rajul [~rajul@59.97.89.231] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 USC	hello
@wiking	hey
@wiking	USC: what version of shogun r u trying to use
@wiking	?
 USC	latest version
 USC	thanks for writing
 USC	3.2.0
 USC	wiking: 3.2.0
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@195.101.111.125] has joined #shogun
 USC	wiking: are you there?
@wiking	try using git develop branch
@wiking	that'll generate u what u want
 USC	could you please provide me the link for git develop branch?
@wiking	git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
@wiking	or if u don;t know git
@wiking	then u can just
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/archive/develop.zip
 USC	I have a question, if somebody creates matlab files for shogun, can those matlab files be used on another computer?
@wiking	matlab files for shogun?
 USC	yes
@wiking	you mean the inteface file...?
 USC	yes
 USC	I'm trying to use shogun on MATLAB
@wiking	well you could use it... but it wouldn't necesarily work
@wiking	your biggest problem with matlab + shogun is going to be
@wiking	that actually a lot of new features you are going to miss :<
@wiking	as it's using the old static interface
 USC	than what is your suggestion?
 USC	how can I use shogun? I have windows 8.1
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	well
@wiking	you want to use it from matlab
@wiking	?
@wiking	have u maybe tried ever python?
 USC	it would be better for me because I'm familiar with matlab, but if many features are missing in MATLAB interface, then I would like to benefit all of its features,
 USC	does shogun fully function with python?
 USC	or should I install wmware linux virtual machine on my computer?
@wiking	python modular interface is fully functional
@wiking	mm myou could use docker
 USC	what is docker?
@wiking	https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/
 USC	ok
 USC	are you a developer of shogun?
@wiking	yep
 USC	cool
 USC	does it have multiple kernel learning features?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	there's some examples about that
@wiking	u can check for yourself
 USC	on what platform should I use shogun? do I need to learn linux to run it with its full features?
@wiking	no not at all
@wiking	that's why i suggested you docker
@wiking	that's i think the easiest way to have shogun
@wiking	atm
 USC	atm?
 USC	at the moment :)
@wiking	yes
@wiking	as i'm hoping that one day we'll be able to natively compile shogun on windwos
 USC	this is what we're looking for, it would be great
 USC	docker is a linux virtual machine for windows?
 USC	is there a how-to-use-shogun-on-docker-file available?
 USC	wiking: ?
@wiking	usc yes
@wiking	you can use yourself this one
@wiking	it's not the official (as we are still working on that)
@wiking	https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb/
@wiking	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1IAuMTUD2k
 USC	thank you very much, you're great
@wiking	nw
 USC	where are you from? where do you live?
@wiking	hehe
@wiking	atm i'm in singapore
 USC	cool
 USC	do you have a contact e-mail or facebook?
@wiking	the best is to use the mailing list of shogun as more shogun developer reads it
@wiking	shogun-list@shogun-toolbox.org

 USC	hello wiking
 USC	I installed docker, then I lost my internet connection
 USC	could you please re-send me the documentation for docker - shogun?
 USC	and the youtube video
 USC	after installation, I just double-clicked Boot2Docker Start shortcut my on desktop, do I need to do anything like update etc.
@wiking	11:16 <@wiking> it's not the official (as we are still working on that)

 USC	docker version 1.3.1 build 4e9bbfa
 USC	and it says Docker client does not run on windows for now please use "c:\....
 USC	is this okay?
@wiking	should be
@wiking	but then again about docker read the official documentation
@wiking	https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/
 USC	this docker is very complicated
 USC	what language is that?
 USC	docker run -p forward_port:8888 -v outside_ipynbs:/ipynbs -d c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb
 USC	wiking: I know I take a lot of your time
@wiking	mmm this you should write in your command line
@wiking	cmd.exe
@wiking	i dont know how's that called in windows 8.1

@wiking	mmm
@wiking	docker.exe  maybe?
@wiking	oh no
@wiking	here it is
@wiking	Run the Boot2Docker Start shell script from your Desktop or Program Files > Boot2Docker for Windows. The Start script will ask you to enter an ssh key passphrase - the simplest (but least secure) is to just hit [Enter].
@wiking	so do that
@wiking	and after that
@wiking	run that docker command
@wiking	check https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/
@wiking	for more details
 USC	in docker screen or in windows cmd screen
@wiking	USC: plz read the instruction at https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/
@wiking	it's pretty straightforward
 USC	wiking: ok, I'm already doing it, but okay
@wiking	great
 USC	I guess docker is working properly, hello-world worked
@wiking	good
@wiking	then you need to do
@wiking	docker pull c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb
 USC	I need help, sorry, I tried
@wiking	what have u tried?
 USC	docker run -it ubuntu bash
@wiking	and?
 USC	and command line identifier changed from $ to /#
@wiking	then it's working
@wiking	;)
 USC	do I need to get back to $ screen to use docker pull c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb
@wiking	since that means that you logged into the docker container
@wiking	yes
@wiking	so enter
@wiking	logout
@wiking	that will get u back to $
@wiking	and there write
@wiking	docker pull c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb
 USC	bash: logout: not login shell: use 'exit'
 USC	should I enter exit
 USC	ok
 USC	exit worked, now I'm back to $
@wiking	ah ok then exit
@wiking	so now you do
@wiking	docker pull c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb
@wiking	and after that
@wiking	the docker run ...
 USC	I says image c3h3/oblas-py278-shogun-ipynb not found
 USC	sorry I mistyped
 USC	I worked
@wiking	cool
 USC	wiking
 USC	how can I paste into docker screen?
 USC	copy a command then paste into docker screen?
 USC	wiking:
 USC	it says "invalid hostPort: forward port" when tried docker run...
