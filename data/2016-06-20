 sanuj	lisitsyn, yo
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i think we should hide any from swig
 lisitsyn	sanuj: hey
 lisitsyn	why?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we don't need as<> in python
 sanuj	or anything else from any
 sanuj	and i am getting these infinite warnings
 sanuj	SGBase.i:570: Warning 503: Can't wrap '_as< int >' unless renamed to a valid identifier.
 lisitsyn	uhmm okay we don't use it (yet)
 lisitsyn	ahh ok
 lisitsyn	just ignore it ok
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and SGBase.i:678: Warning 314: 'as' is a python keyword, renaming to '_as'
 sanuj	lisitsyn, %template(as ## name) Any::as<type>;
 sanuj	shall i remove this or keep it? ^
 lisitsyn	sanuj: well you're removing Any :)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay so shall i remove any in SGBase.i?
 lisitsyn	yeah yeah
 lisitsyn	just remove it
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we need to solve template issue in swig
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes and a few more things
 sanuj	lisitsyn, an example using swig interface https://gist.github.com/sanuj/e24d003b5af990fee1b772129ace75fa
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we are really lagging behind our timeline
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah no worries
 lisitsyn	it is rather underestimation
 lisitsyn	than underperformance :)
 sanuj	okay :D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you were going to send me a mail for what else is needed before we merge tags
 lisitsyn	mehh yeah I am out of schedule as well
 lisitsyn	ok actually there is a thing you can try to implement now
 sanuj	okay :)
 sanuj	tell me
 lisitsyn	have you seen class_list.cpp?
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	that huge thing
 lisitsyn	sanuj: basically it stores string -> object ctor
 lisitsyn	mapping
 sanuj	okay

 lisitsyn	sanuj: it enables us to do similar thing as we did with setSomething
 lisitsyn	newKernel, newFeatures, blabla
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	you can implement it on top of new_sgserializable quite easily
 sanuj	why do we need it though
 sanuj	new_sgserializable?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: this is how our plugins interface would look like
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/base/class_list.cpp.templ#L39

-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what is this exactly
 lisitsyn	I have to check what's missing
 lisitsyn	probably we miss some examples
 sanuj	how is new_sgserializable related to plugins/tags
 lisitsyn	sanuj: well that's the thing to be replaced, we can start with implementing some interface to create instances by their name
 lisitsyn	this would let us to start working on plugins under the hood
 lisitsyn	without any change in interface
 sanuj	oh so this is for plugins
 sanuj	and not tags
 lisitsyn	yeah it is rather plugins than tags
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but i don't understand what changes do i have to make in cpp_list
 sanuj	class_list*
 sanuj	and class_list on my local is huge
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@host-92-0-162-192.as43234.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you don't have to change class_list.cpp
 lisitsyn	but its template
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: we need methods like createKernel("name")
 lisitsyn	create* for all base classes
 sanuj	ohkay
 lisitsyn	I think template + swig renames are way to go
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so createKernel("gaussian") returns an instance of GaussianKernel
 sanuj	?
-!- [Chris] [~Chris]@deadtime.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	CKernel*
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@59.95.6.201] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, how methods like createKernel("name") related to plugin architecture?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: in plugins we have to stick to strings
 sanuj	lisitsyn, only string parameters?
 lisitsyn	we won't have classes like GaussianKernel visible once we convert to plugins
 lisitsyn	we can only retrieve some CKernel that is named gaussian
 sanuj	i see
 lisitsyn	sanuj: so once you call
 lisitsyn	createKernel("gaussian")
 lisitsyn	it checks whether there is such plugin
 lisitsyn	loads it if needed
 lisitsyn	and then calls corresponding stuff in the plugin to create this kernel for you
 [Chris]	Hi, is it possible to use random forests with BinaryLabels ? I get the following error when calling rand_forests.train(train_feats): src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp line 77: label type supplied is not supported
 lisitsyn	[Chris]: probably no but why do you want to?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so createKernel is in base shogun
 sanuj	and plugin is for gaussian kernel?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes
 sanuj	i see
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we are going to enable functions like createKernel via changes in class_list?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I think you'd need template <class T> T* create(string)
 lisitsyn	and then rename them just like you did with set get
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so only the renaming part will happen in class_list
 sanuj	where to put "template <class T> T* create(string)"?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: class_list.cpp.templ would work I think
 sanuj	 so all the base methods in plugin arch will go in  class_list.cpp.templ
 sanuj	lisitsyn, are you away?
 sanuj	:P

@wiking	mmm lemme check
@wiking	sorry today is slow for me
 sanuj	no, i just wanted to confirm
 sanuj	because i don't see it on gmane

@wiking	ho
 Saurabh7	wiking, I have updated most intensive routines of cart
 Saurabh7	so its pretty compettive now
 Saurabh7	but cant find anything else I can change performance wise
 Saurabh7	wiking, any ideas what else should be touched there in general

 Saurabh7	HeikoS, hi
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi there=
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: how are things?
@HeikoS	just going through patches here
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, us finished ixing things for cart regression
 Saurabh7	so that shld be working now
 Saurabh7	wokring to make those changes work for randomCART
 Saurabh7	so that it will reflect in random forest performance
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: you compared a bit against sklearn implementation?
@HeikoS	any big differences?
 Saurabh7	for random forest ?
@HeikoS	both
 Saurabh7	not yet need to make this radnomcart work
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	how are we doing timewise?
 Saurabh7	cart performance is same now
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	that is very good
 Saurabh7	I shared it
@HeikoS	we should be faster
@HeikoS	I know, hard to remoember all the times.
@HeikoS	:)
 Saurabh7	okie :)
 Saurabh7	I wil finish this randomcart then compare random forest
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I think in RF, Shogun should be quite a bit faster than python
@HeikoS	since not so much linear algebra operations
 Saurabh7	its need refactoring tho
@HeikoS	but different
 Saurabh7	almost 300 line code is same from cart
@HeikoS	ok cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: shall we have different patches for the different files?
@HeikoS	then I can already merge some parts
@HeikoS	easier to review
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok sure
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: is our RF multithreaded yet?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, no
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ok, that will be a good thing to do :)
@HeikoS	but later
 Saurabh7	subsets are heavliy used in here too
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I think once you have done the first set of changes
@HeikoS	we can do the read only features
@HeikoS	with subsets
 Saurabh7	so they need to be absoulety thread safe
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	but are they read only?
@HeikoS	or are they written?
 Saurabh7	used on labels too
@HeikoS	yep
 Saurabh7	its read only
@HeikoS	once we change all this to read only
@HeikoS	we can also update the xvalidation
 Saurabh7	ok
 Saurabh7	i will try to finish this random cart, somethings fishy here
 Saurabh7	samples are picked randomly but labels used are same:D
 Saurabh7	need to double check
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	that is fishy indeed :I
@HeikoS	ok cool, let me know if you need help
@HeikoS	I will be out of country from Wednesday btw
@HeikoS	 I will take my laptop with me
@HeikoS	but irc is limited
@HeikoS	back monday
@HeikoS	so email is better from mid week
 Saurabh7	okie , let u know
