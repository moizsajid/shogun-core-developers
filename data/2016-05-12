@wiking	arianepaola: ok so i've looked around again
@wiking	this seems to be the best setup.py for me https://github.com/telamonian/ocudump/blob/master/setup.py
@wiking	to start with that does something with cmake
@wiking	lemme know if you have a better idea

 CaBa	after using ParameterCombination::apply_to_machine(m) - is there a way to get the parameter combination out of m again?
 CaBa	probably not, since apply_to_machine() distributes the parameters around where they belong...
 CaBa	*sigh*
 CaBa	I begin to think every class in shogun should have an obtain_from_generic() cast function :P
 Saurabh7	CaBa: what do you mean by get out? values are already there in ParameterCombination object
 Saurabh7	where else did you need a cast
 CaBa	Saurabh7: in my case i didn't have the parametercombination object later on
 CaBa	Saurabh7: oh it's just a bit annoying that in python i can't do anything like 'crossval.get_machine().get_C1()' or so, because all the getters return superclass pointers and the casting can't happen in the py-world...
 Saurabh7	CaBa: you can get the individual paramters form the machine I think , and they should be the right type ideally
 CaBa	Saurabh7: yes, but i have to keep a properly typed reference to the machine
 Saurabh7	if they are not, the getters from the machine shoudl definelty return right type if you ahve an example do tell
 Saurabh7	so it shoul dbe fixed
 Saurabh7	CaBa:oh i see you are trying to get it from the crossval obj
-!- mizari [~mizari@95-174-213-100.nts.su] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 CaBa	Saurabh7: yes. a lot of the getter functions that can be found in the api doc are pretty much useless for users who access them through the swig python equivalents...
 CaBa	what happened to CrossValidation::set_conf_int_alpha()?
 arianepaola	wiking: thanks

 OXPHOS	Hey HeikoS, wiking! I have the summary/questions ready in my proposal, on page3-4.
 OXPHOS	Can you guys have a look if you have time? Thanks!
 OXPHOS	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eozTFX_mgKx3eXQfQnP07Rxi8GYKfGYdu_qvGpLRnjw/edit?usp=sharing
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: checking
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: commented a bit
@HeikoS	maybe email rahul the link so he can comment as well
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Sure thanks. So basically the last idea is what we want to apply (If SGMatrix::onGPU() == false && linalg::have_backend(GPU) == true)
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: No #ifdef is needed

@HeikoS	yes exactly
@HeikoS	no ifdef needed
@HeikoS	and the gpu_linalg falls back to the cpu one if the SGMatrix doesnt live in GPU memory
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
 OXPHOS	Got it
@wiking	yep
@wiking	ok i'll check the docs
@wiking	arianepaola: do you know packer?
 OXPHOS	And thanks @ lisitsyn for showing me some.h yesterday.. Didn't realize smart_pointer is already there!
 lisitsyn	ya
 lisitsyn	yes under sophisticated name
 lisitsyn	OXPHOS: there is also 'Unique'
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: did you check cereal already?
 OXPHOS	lisitsyn: Haha I'm too late
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Yes I checked the docs and played around for a bit
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: But haven't made any progress from yesterday yet
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	curious how it will play with the smart pointers
@HeikoS	wiking: any news on GPL-BSD?
@HeikoS	I noticed a renaming
@wiking	HeikoS: i'll ping agian
@wiking	because i have no fucking idea
@wiking	where he disappeared
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	its soon time to get that out
@HeikoS	should be next step for us
@HeikoS	wiking: btw we still have this other option
@HeikoS	of releasing a bsd archive with no history
@HeikoS	and only bsd code
@HeikoS	that we just decided to make bsd since we own the code
@HeikoS	and that doesnt contain any gpl code
@wiking	that's not really an option
@wiking	because where do you store that code?
@wiking	i mean you want to generated that when there's a release?
-!- besser82 [~besser82@fedora/besser82] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o besser82] by ChanServ
@wiking	change license header etc?
@HeikoS	wiking: for this single release
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	but this release
@wiking	is not about bsd
@wiking	:D
@wiking	or is it?
@wiking	it is
@wiking	:)
@wiking	well yeah dunno
@HeikoS	this release was supposed to be the last nonc++11 one
@wiking	pinged my frient
@HeikoS	and we wanted to make it bsd as well
@wiking	*firend
@wiking	*friend
@HeikoS	so that we have one non c++11 AND bsd
@wiking	but w8ing still
@wiking	yep yeo
@wiking	i remember now
@wiking	dunno what to say
@wiking	it's all fishy
@wiking	the problem is that if we fuckup
@HeikoS	I can give up on that bsd thing
@wiking	it's all void
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but if you want it really badly that there is a bsd shogun out there before gsoc
@HeikoS	we can do that archive
@HeikoS	as a "special edition" ;)
@wiking	:>
@HeikoS	could do a fork and hand hack it
@HeikoS	but well
@HeikoS	not ideal
@wiking	fork ssssssssssnooogood
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	lets wait till next monday
@HeikoS	ok
@wiking	and fire up aws
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	hehe ;)
@HeikoS	just worried that gsoc start soon
@HeikoS	and OXPHOS needs the smart pointers for cereal
@wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	oh man I am looking forward to dropping the serialization code we have ;)
@HeikoS	and to the plugins
@wiking	smart pointer for cereal?
@wiking	you mean c++11 for cerela
@wiking	:>
@HeikoS	yeah
@wiking	ok who needs aws access
@HeikoS	doesnt like raw ones
@wiking	raise your hands
@HeikoS	I dont really want, to not break stuff ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: ?
@wiking	sonney2k_: ?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi
 lisitsyn	wiking: yesp leas e
 lisitsyn	just in case
@wiking	sent an email
@wiking	if you want passwd
@wiking	lemme know
@wiking	:>
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	forget the ssh key

@wiking	should we actually have dc/os running over this shit? :)
@wiking	i mean for shogun-cloud
 Saurabh7	HeikoS: yo
 Saurabh7	the talk was pretty cool
@wiking	arianepaola: ^ what ya think?
@wiking	which talk? :)
 Saurabh7	cache locality stuff which improveed performance
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: talk?
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	that might be good to check for the algos you touch
@HeikoS	and a report would be good for the project summary
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Hey I'm kinda confused why you said there's no GPUVector structure?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we decided to ditch it
@HeikoS	and do everything with SGMatrix
@HeikoS	and SGMatrix::isOnGPU() knows
 OXPHOS	No SGVector either?
@wiking	Saurabh7: where?
 Saurabh7	wiking: what performance? i think they tried on mmd test, i will try on some of our algos
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: No SGVector either? Or just transfer SGVector to GPUMatrix?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: nono
@HeikoS	there is not GPUMatrix
@HeikoS	but you can do
@HeikoS	cpu_to_gpu(SGMatrix)
@HeikoS	which does the transfer and changes a flag inside SGMatrix
 Saurabh7	wiking: btw what profiler where you suggesting, perf right ?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	lisitsyn: got it?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: aha this is so-called 'merge SGMatrix and GPUMatrix'
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: yes exactly
@HeikoS	no need for a new structure
@HeikoS	since we are not doing compile time method calls anymore
@HeikoS	like currently
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: But sorry it made me even more confused...We use SGMatrix do to calculation on GPU?
 OXPHOS	What kind of flag are you referring to?
 OXPHOS	isOnGPU()
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Okay back to the first question: We use SGMatrix do to calculation on GPU? with ViennaCL?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: yes
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
@HeikoS	right?
@HeikoS	it is just a wrapper for memory
@HeikoS	and knows where that memory lies
 OXPHOS	We explicitly transfer memory from CPU to GPU, and do the calculation there with ViennaCL library.
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	point is: explicit transfer
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Aha. Unfortunately I know nothing about the memory transfer/GPU calculation yet..I'll do some research. Any suggestion where I can start or just google it?
 OXPHOS	I'll know so much more by the end of GSoC..
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I think you should study the existing calls that happen on the GPU
@HeikoS	there is already transfer calls in Shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: any news on the IO bug?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: Got it. Thanks!
