 c4goldsw	buildbot dance
 c4goldsw	:(
-!- OXPHOS [c68f0c0c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.198.143.12.12] has joined #shogun
 OXPHOS	@wiking: hey got time? im wondering about the template implementation
 c4goldsw	Hey OXPHOS
 c4goldsw	I think it's pretty quiet here.
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: hey ;)
 c4goldsw	You're in NY, right?
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: might be too early for wiking..just curious
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: nope im now in china. came back last weekend
 c4goldsw	Ah, ok.  I'm heading to Colorado and AZ from Denmark for Vacation in a few hours
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: cool r u from denmark? very nice place as i heard
 c4goldsw	I'm not Danish, I just happen to have lived  there - I study in Canada, but my family is still here in DK.  It is nice too,
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: but it's kinda hot in AZ..one of my friends was there last week, around 40C?
 c4goldsw	OXPHOS I'm actually going rafting down the Grand Canyon for two weeks
 c4goldsw	it's ~300 kilometers.
 OXPHOS	ohoh
 c4goldsw	So it might be a bit cooler down in the Canyon.
 c4goldsw	Bless, my unit test worked.
 c4goldsw	OXPHOS: Where in China are you?
 OXPHOS	it will ;)
 OXPHOS	in a city 300km from BJ
 OXPHOS	but the same hot
 c4goldsw	I've been to BJ once, for three weeks - three years ago.  Quite fun.
 OXPHOS	whoo really? which season? that makes a big difference
 OXPHOS	It's quite different - i gotta say - after 3 years in the US. Sometimes I'm not used to what people do
 c4goldsw	Summer - the weather was decent.  It was also to see the smog.
 c4goldsw	I should get back to work, but I'll be on the IRC.
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: kk good luck and enjoy the vacation!

 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yo
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 jojo
@HeikoS	just saw your email
@HeikoS	need a PR so I can commetn
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 duplicate features should be no problem
 Saurabh7	yes i saw
 Saurabh7	ah I did cahnges on top of that actually
@HeikoS	Saurabh7 ok?
@HeikoS	any idea already how much that helps for RF?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, so its makes sense to ahve duplicate indices
 Saurabh7	?
-!- Saurabh7_ [~saurabh@103.197.140.30] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: what do you mean?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  in terms of the algorithm in correct?
 Saurabh7	 a subset like 2 0 2 1
 Saurabh7	2 is repeated
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: i get it, is that part of algo or not?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: I mean it is easy to deal with
 Saurabh7	choosing a random subset is  a part
@HeikoS	question is: is this wanted
@HeikoS	because intuitively, doesnt really make sense
 Saurabh7	yes
 Saurabh7	we can permute indices and choose first ones or so
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: nono
@HeikoS	we have to check whether we should do that or not first
@HeikoS	that is, try to understand why it is done atm, is it done in alternative implementations?
 Saurabh7	not sure completely
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: gotta clear that !
@HeikoS	before dealing with it
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: btw results should not change if you presort
 Saurabh7	no results are not changing
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: also, I did not really get this flag you introduced, would presorting be optional?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, for single tree I thought it wold be optional
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: why?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: because you only sort once anyways
@HeikoS	just need a possibility to set a presorted (transposed) feature matrix
@HeikoS	you can make pre-sort() a method
@HeikoS	which you have already
@HeikoS	and also want a setter
@HeikoS	but you should always presort I think,
@HeikoS	or is there a use case where you dont want to do that?
 Saurabh7	ye  you migh tbe right
 Saurabh7	I was thinking for a node split sometimes we dont need to sort all vectors just the subset
@HeikoS	but if you presort everything once
@HeikoS	that should do it no?
 Saurabh7	but best it to check
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: but I see what oyu mean
@HeikoS	you kinda want to avoid sorting all
@HeikoS	when not all are used?
@HeikoS	Id rater presort all
 Saurabh7	no, sort onyl ones needed
@HeikoS	CART is never used alone
@HeikoS	and in RF
@HeikoS	you will in total have everything sorted
 Saurabh7	yes in RF definetly
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so we got that going almost
@HeikoS	gotta check these double indices
@HeikoS	might be that we can unique them, but really check this
@HeikoS	might have important implications
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  yes thinking
 Saurabh7	ok i will check if its correct
 Saurabh7	otherwise make it work
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ok lets merge this then when done
@HeikoS	and do feature parallel afterwards
@HeikoS	should be quite fast then :)
 Saurabh7	yep want to se it in parallel :)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7:  but lets do that later
