 n4nd0	hi all, can someone lend me a hand wiht a mosek license file?
 n4nd0	the links on the official page for students/research licenses are broken :(
-!- OgreMagi [~vinaygarg@14.139.82.6] has joined #shogun
 OgreMagi	Hi
 n4nd0	OgreMagi: hey!
 OgreMagi	Can you help me with application procedure for GSoC. I am interested in the project "Integrate C5.0"
 OgreMagi	What should be my 1st step?
 n4nd0	well I am not a mentor, just another student as you probably are :)
 n4nd0	but maybe I can give you any tip
 n4nd0	what first step are you looking for? to get into contact with shogun or to prepare your application more specifically?
 OgreMagi	Both may be
 OgreMagi	Is this your 1st time ?
 n4nd0	applying for gsoc with shogun?
 OgreMagi	Yes
 n4nd0	yes, it is
 OgreMagi	and what about GSoC in general ?
 n4nd0	I've not been a GSoC student before
 OgreMagi	Okay.
 OgreMagi	So, which project are you interested in?
 n4nd0	SO-SVM
 OgreMagi	Okay.
 OgreMagi	So how are you proceeding?
 OgreMagi	?
 wiking	n4nd0: yep
 n4nd0	so I am making some contributions to the project in general, and working on the topic of the GSoC project I want to apply for
 wiking	n4nd0: let me dugout for what do you need it?
 wiking	since libqp will more or less do the same for you and it's gpl licensed...
 wiking	n4nd0: gimme an email addr
 wiking	so that i can fwd you the whole email with the license
 n4nd0	n4nd0: so I am taking a look to this project http://mloss.org/software/view/250/
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	i wanted to test that as well
 wiking	it depends as well on mosek?
 n4nd0	either mosek or cplex
 wiking	sent
 n4nd0	thanks :)
 n4nd0	OgreMagi: so have you tried to get a bit familiarized with the code?
 n4nd0	forking the repo and getting the source locally
-!- romi_ [~mizobe@187.74.11.203] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 wiking	so i was saying
 wiking	that for doing SO-SVM, e.g. hm-svm
 wiking	it'd be great to have Interface and develop the general quadratic solver library libqp
 n4nd0	like the one provided in mosek?
 wiking	because libqp would be great solver for the structuralsvm
 wiking	so that you don't rely on cplex or mosek
 wiking	that is actually proprietary
 n4nd0	that was exactly a question I have
 wiking	there's already an initial interfacing between libqp and shogun
 n4nd0	do these things exist for C++ in open source?
 n4nd0	aham
 wiking	but it should be interfaced in a nicer way
 wiking	i'm trying to do the latent svm thingy
 wiking	and it's the same story
 wiking	having libqp integrated into shogun
 wiking	would be great
 wiking	so now i'm like doing the both at once
 wiking	but i had some paperworks shit i had to finish
 wiking	so i couldnt start it just until recently
 wiking	so it's still nowhere
 n4nd0	is it lot of work? the interface of libqp in shogun?
-!- romi_ [~mizobe@187.101.60.135] has joined #shogun
 wiking	but i'm hoping to get something out soon, at least in my own repo in a separate branch...
 wiking	well as far as i can see no... but of course it should be done with a little bit of care of the api
 wiking	because if you check now
 wiking	libqp.h
 wiking	under src/shogun/classifier/svm
 n4nd0	I taking a look to it right nwo
 wiking	so it's kind of like just a straight plugging in of libqp
 wiking	and only one part of libqp is integrated...
 wiking	libqp_splx.c
 wiking	libqp_gsmo.c is still missing
 n4nd0	I don't really know that is the difference between them
 wiking	http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~xfrancv/libqp/html/ as a short description

 n4nd0	btw, didn't ask you before
 n4nd0	wiking: what do you want to try with HM-SVM?
 wiking	images

 n4nd0	more in particular :P?

 PSmitAalto	Hello
 PSmitAalto	I have a small problem building shogun and I was wondering if you could help
 PSmitAalto	I am building shogun with CPLEX support and the python_modular interface
 PSmitAalto	Now compiling fails at classifier/LPBoost.cpp
 PSmitAalto	classifier/LPBoost.cpp: In member function 'float64_t shogun::CLPBoost::find_max_violator(int32_t&)': classifier/LPBoost.cpp:82: error: 'labels' was not declared in this scope classifier/LPBoost.cpp: In member function 'virtual bool shogun::CLPBoost::train_machine(shogun::CFeatures*)': classifier/LPBoost.cpp:106: error: 'labels' was not declared in this scope classifier/LPBoost.cpp:108: error: 'labels' was not
 PSmitAalto	Does anyone have an idea what the problem could be?
 blackburn	PSmitAalto: yes, I know the error
 blackburn	PSmitAalto: just change labels -> m_labels there
 blackburn	I am not able to fix it in master branch right now
 PSmitAalto	Ok, thanks, I'll try that
 blackburn	PSmitAalto: it is pretty good you found it out cause we are in pre-release state
-!- aang [0e8be4d2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.139.228.210] has joined #shogun
 PSmitAalto	The same problem is in LPM.cpp, SubGradientLPM.cpp and svm/CPLEXSVM.cpp
 blackburn	oh damn thanks for reporting
@sonney2k	gsomix, hi...
@sonney2k	sounds like you make good progress
 blackburn	sonney2k: if you have time could you please labels->m_labels in classifier/LPM.cpp; classifier/SubGradientLPM.cpp; classifier/svm/CPLEXSVM.cpp and classifier/LPBoost.cpp?
@sonney2k	gsomix, you should expect only one python version to be installed, i.e. what is specified to configure via ./configure --python=python3
 blackburn	sonney2k: gsomix can you enlighten me on this progess too? ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok done
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4064deb / (4 files in 2 dirs): change labels -> m_labels - http://git.io/yxDNjg
 blackburn	thanks!
 blackburn	PSmitAalto: you may use latest git now
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw have you ever used ctags with vim?
 blackburn	works like a charm
 PSmitAalto	Thanks for updating so quickly!
-!- PSmitAalto [82e9b263@gateway/web/freenode/ip.130.233.178.99] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is a makefile target for that - so yes
@sonney2k	but I forgot what it is - didn't use it for years...
 blackburn	sonney2k: e.g. with cursor on classname and Ctrl+] you may jump right to its definition
 blackburn	or even
 blackburn	:ta CMKL
 blackburn	and voi-la you are in classifier/mkl/MKL.cpp
@sonney2k	ohh yeah I need this :)
@sonney2k	the make ctags target needs an update then
 blackburn	I just got tired with using 5% of vim's potential
 blackburn	and tried some new things
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can't see any ctags target
@sonney2k	blackburn, in which dir do ctags have to be?
 blackburn	sonney2k: src would be sufficient
@sonney2k	blackburn, cd shogun ; make ctags
 blackburn	sonney2k: does it work for you? I have no shogun there but there is no ctags mention in makefile..
@sonney2k	I guess we need ctags only for libshogun so we can as well have another ctags target in the upper dir
@sonney2k	alright... I have to leave now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	sonney2k: see ya
-!- nicococo [~nico@lacedcoffee.ml.tu-berlin.de] has left #shogun []
 blackburn	aha works in shogun
 blackburn	strange no mention in makefile
 gsomix	sonney2k, okay
 gsomix	I missed these settings when I read --help. =__=
 blackburn	gsomix: what are the things you are talking about?

 Varagrawal_	Hey
 Varagrawal_	I have installed Shogun from source y cloning the repo
 Varagrawal_	But when I try to run msplicer in the applications folder, I get the error "ERROR IMPORTING MODULES. PLEASE INSTALL SHOGUN"
 Varagrawal_	Any help?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	Varagrawal_, try to remove a try-except block in msplicer's code. And look where the error occurs.
 gsomix	n4nd0, hi
 Varagrawal_	dyn = shogun.Structure.DynProg()
 Varagrawal_	shogun not defined
 gsomix	Varagrawal_, sorry.
 gsomix	I mean, you have to do only import modules. Without catching exceptions.
 Varagrawal_	ah
 Varagrawal_	ok
 Varagrawal_	importerror
 Varagrawal_	cannot import name SVM
 Varagrawal_	also when I try to run the minimal.cpp program as given in the tuts
 Varagrawal_	gsomix: I get the error "Undefined reference to shogun..."
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: that undegined reference happens when you run or when you compile it?
 n4nd0	undefined sorry
 Varagrawal_	compile
 gsomix	Varagrawal_, what keys/flags do you use for compiling and linking?
 gsomix	Varagrawal_, you can view the makefile in the examples.
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: probably you should link to the libraries
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: try to use -lshogun
 Varagrawal_	g++ -lshogun minimal.cpp -o minimal
 n4nd0	I have just tested it with
 n4nd0	g++ basic_minimal.cpp -o test -lshogun
 n4nd0	and it worked for me
 gsomix	similary
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: so, better now?
 Varagrawal_	a min
 n4nd0	sorry
 Varagrawal_	I got what's wrong
 Varagrawal_	got it working
 n4nd0	great
 n4nd0	in any case
 n4nd0	you should have a makefile in the directory examples/undocumented/libshogun
 n4nd0	just go there and run make
 Varagrawal_	n4nd0: ok
 n4nd0	no worries about compile flags
 Varagrawal_	n4nd0: Thanks a bunch mate!! :D
 Varagrawal_	Ha, found some errors in the code
 Varagrawal_	:P
 Varagrawal_	missing ';'s
 n4nd0	:P
 n4nd0	your first patch there :)

 blackburn	n4nd0: back to kernel subsetting
 blackburn	you probably would have to check
 blackburn	whether kernel is custom
 blackburn	and act according to that
 blackburn	i.e. with normal kernels you just subset features
 blackburn	and with custom you use set_col_subset and set_row_subset
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have to check those methods
 blackburn	oops no power left
 n4nd0	blackburn: but is the idea to leave those to be implemented in the custom kernel?
 blackburn	something like that

 Varagrawal_	n4nd0: I got the exact same thing earlier!!! :D
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: so I guess there must be sth weird with that executable, the makefile looks a bit weird too
 Varagrawal_	n4nd0: Then blackburn told me to get rid of the exception block in the beginning
 Varagrawal_	n4nd0: The import error is basically in the SVM I guess
 n4nd0	Varagrawal_: I am getting an import error in another place now so I don't know ...

 OgreMagi	hi
 Varagrawal	n4nd0: No man, it was hilarious the way you said it
 blackburn	hi
 n4nd0	Varagrawal: haha ok
 OgreMagi	This is my 1st time I am applying for GSoC, can anybody help me how to proceed ?
 n4nd0	Varagrawal: phrasal verbs and I are not very good friends :P
 Varagrawal	n4nd0: You're not alone
 blackburn	OgreMagi: you should choice idea you find interesting
 blackburn	and contact your mentor
 blackburn	possible one I mean
 OgreMagi	blackburn: Yes I am interested in the project named "Integrate C5.0" of Shogun MLT
 blackburn	OgreMagi: so contact Soeren via sonne at debian.org
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe you came across it while fixing msplicer, but just in case there's an indenting issue in StringFeatures.h:384
 OgreMagi	blackburn: Are you a mentor?
 blackburn	OgreMagi: no, I'm not, I help Soeren with admin'ing a little
 blackburn	and active developer :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: huh we've got a lot of such improper indenting
 n4nd0	n4nd0: :(
 blackburn	n4nd0: no worries at all shogun doesn't get slower because of bad indenting ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: :P
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn: I wonder man, is it because of changes in the interfaces that these errors show up?
 n4nd0	blackburn: e.g. before it was set_string_features and now set_features in CStringFeatures
 blackburn	n4nd0: errors with msplicer etc?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, like these small things in the names of the methods and the like
 blackburn	exactly
 blackburn	nothing more
 blackburn	PreProc -> Preprocessor
 n4nd0	blackburn: I would be really cool if there was something to fix them automatically
 n4nd0	I bet it is already invented somewhere
 blackburn	also
 n4nd0	have you heard of it before?
 blackburn	and even some forgotten (float64_t* w, int32_t len) -> SGVector<float64_t> w conversion
 blackburn	n4nd0: I can't mind how can it be automatic
 n4nd0	blackburn: well I don't really know either but for example the autocomplete function of terminador or eclipse
 blackburn	well for better compatibility we should rather not change names
 n4nd0	blackburn: I guess that something similar to that could be used
 blackburn	it is a overkill for me
 n4nd0	I meant terminator before, sorry
 blackburn	I mean that is not really need to automate 2 line fixes
 n4nd0	mmm maybe
 n4nd0	blackburn: what as the set_col_subset and set_row_subset for CustomKernel you tell me about
 n4nd0	blackburn: why doesn't a normal set_subset suffice?
 blackburn	n4nd0: basically same as set_subset
 blackburn	well it doesn't assume features are equal
 blackburn	(while training they are for sure)
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, I see the idea but probably I should take a closer look to CustomKernel to understand it better
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is just a matrix
 blackburn	main thing is normal kernels
 n4nd0	blackburn: one more thing, do you remember that yesterday you were talking about that there were no problems with github? :P
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	all the commits I have done for the multiclass stuff have gone into the qda pull request
 n4nd0	not such a big problem maybe ... but it kind of sucks
 blackburn	well probably you have commited it into qda branch?
 n4nd0	I merged qda branch into master before doing the pull request
 blackburn	n4nd0: why did you do that?
 blackburn	you may do pull request from different branches
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham
 n4nd0	it looked reasonable for me :O
 blackburn	oops
 n4nd0	ok I think I get it now ... different branches -> different pull requests
 blackburn	n4nd0: scikits guys use pull request to discuss things
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will try to fix it
 blackburn	would be pain in the ass
 n4nd0	although I don't know if I can change the pull request from master to another branch
 n4nd0	probably
 n4nd0	I guess that to remove the unwanted commits from the pull requests would be easier
 blackburn	looks very interesting sometimes
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'll try to do that then, remove the commits related to multiclass from the pull request and do then in another multiclass branch
 blackburn	n4nd0: so you have all the qda things in the qda branch?
 n4nd0	n4nd0: yes, qda things are in my qda branch
 n4nd0	but I did the pull request from master :S
 blackburn	then you could close master pull request
 blackburn	and create one from qda
 n4nd0	looks good
 n4nd0	I've homework for tomorrow then :P
 blackburn	then you may reset your master back to its normal state
 blackburn	and apply multiclass things on top of it
 n4nd0	do you think it doesn't need to be done in another branch the multiclass things?
 blackburn	not really necessary, it is up to you
 blackburn	I mean main intention of using branches here is to make possible to work on two things
 n4nd0	I think I'd probably do it in another branch
 n4nd0	anyhow, time to sleep for me today
 n4nd0	good night people
 n4nd0	blackburn: and thank you very much for all your help again :)
 blackburn	connection lost again huh
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok see you

 PhilTillet	blackburn, I guess it's ok if my opencl code is not fully optimized? :p
 blackburn	PhilTillet: which code?
 PhilTillet	i'm supposed to write some code for SVM on OpenCL for the patch! ^^
 blackburn	ah sure
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.54.204] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	I think it is ok
 blackburn	just show the proof of concept ;)
 PhilTillet	well, I'm almost done implementing the SVM formula with a gaussian kernel, but integrating it will be more difficult :p
 PhilTillet	dataset rarely go over 100 000 examples right?
 blackburn	depends on domain..
 PhilTillet	haha ok :p
 PhilTillet	actually I am chosing which algorithm i'll use to sum the components of a vector, and some are more efficient from size 100 000 :p
 blackburn	PhilTillet: do not pay attention on such details, just integrate code which sucessfully uses opencl when applying svm
 PhilTillet	I probably ask myself too much questions indeed
 blackburn	just load support feature vectors and compute score
 PhilTillet	ok :p
 PhilTillet	and when is the "deadline" by the way?
 blackburn	deadline for?
 PhilTillet	the patch
 blackburn	well there is no such deadlines..
 blackburn	deadline*
 PhilTillet	ok :p
 blackburn	March 26 is students proposals opening IIRC
 PhilTillet	yes
 blackburn	and something like 6, April is proposal deadline
 blackburn	so probably it would be nice to have any contributions before proposal submit deadline
 blackburn	cause you may refer that and it is advantage for sure
 PhilTillet	yes
 PhilTillet	I'll try to :p I have a tough week because I have my first conference presentation ever next week
 PhilTillet	but i'll try to find the time
 blackburn	PhilTillet: as for your 'custom' idea
 blackburn	I think if it is not the only thing you want to work on you should contact mentor of any other idea
 blackburn	and send at least two proposals
 blackburn	I mean if it wasn't possible to select one slot for OpenCL you may compete in some other area
 PhilTillet	Okay :)
 blackburn	I am afraid the number of slots will be unknown by the deadline
 PhilTillet	yes, like last year
 blackburn	in this case I guess Soeren won't be able to make any decision on OpenCL
 blackburn	ok late already
 blackburn	PhilTillet: see you
 PhilTillet	see you :)
