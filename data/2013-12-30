@iglesiasg	sonney2k, ping
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, does our HMM support StringFeatures only?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it is the what I have understood from reading the Python examples and glancing over the implementation
@iglesiasg	just wondering since I need to use vector-valued observations

 besser82	lisitsyn, Hey!
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey
 besser82	lisitsyn: Wassup?
 lisitsyn	besser82: some java ee time for me :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: what about you?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Wit da openJDK && da JBoss, I hope  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: All da CMake
 lisitsyn	besser82: glassfish ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: for da SHOGuN 3.1 release ;)
 lisitsyn	I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: I was actually some time busy by fixing some of your code in da shogun  ;)
 lisitsyn	really?
 lisitsyn	what code?
 besser82	lisitsyn: One simply cannot rely on Defines beeing present :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: verbose mode on!
 besser82	lisitsyn: like da #ifdef HAVE_XXX or USE_XXX  as the first line in some cpp or h
 lisitsyn	uhm
 besser82	lisitsyn: without importing config.h  BEFORE
 lisitsyn	okay I am sorry ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: when setting defines with cc-switches that might be okay  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: just a glitch
 besser82	lisitsyn: but we don't want those switches anymore, because they slow down a build too much
 besser82	lisitsyn:  those switches actually force ccache to recompile those headers everytime again, instead of fetching them from caches
 besser82	lisitsyn: a glitch in da ~30 files (W) by you  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: HeikoS is leader for those glitches  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: 70 files with such `glitch`
@sonney2k	besser82, will be around in ~30mins
 besser82	sonney2k: enough time for me to pop some more pills  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: and how did ya glassfish stuff go?
 besser82	lisitsyn: we really need to get java-shogun working with da OpenJDK
 lisitsyn	besser82: I had some troubles with persistence unit ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: tell me moar  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: its entity manager is not being dependency injected :P
 besser82	lisitsyn: openJDK or Sun?
 besser82	lisitsyn: file a bug ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: nah doesn't matter ;)
 lisitsyn	it is my bug
 besser82	lisitsyn: what are you coding in java, btw?
 besser82	lisitsyn: and why java?
 lisitsyn	besser82: ah just some programming assignment
 lisitsyn	totally stupid but I have to do that
 besser82	lisitsyn: You need da $$$ that bad :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: no that's my stupid university
 besser82	lisitsyn: change to a better one  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: just 5 months left
 lisitsyn	too late
 besser82	lisitsyn: damn
 besser82	lisitsyn: do they demand glassfish?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no
 lisitsyn	good idea
 besser82	lisitsyn: hehe
 besser82	lisitsyn: da JBoss is da mut moar cool kid on da bloxx
 besser82	lisitsyn: or just a mutch more simpler approach?
 lisitsyn	besser82: nah just simple application
 lisitsyn	jboss is overkill
 besser82	lisitsyn: kk
 besser82	lisitsyn: it's just like me having me red hat on  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn:  http://besser82.fedorapeople.org/2013-12-30-212559.jpg   :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha
 lisitsyn	besser82: I want a hat like that!
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn: I can send you, when I get my next set of swag  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: you really want one?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: hehe would be funny
 besser82	lisitsyn: what do you have in mind with that?!?
 besser82	lisitsyn: you play Golf?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: me neither and there's soooo much redhat-golfballs left in my swag carton
 besser82	lisitsyn, sonney2k:  Who on +1 to give one of theese to TJ?   http://lf.staplespromotionalproducts.com/lf?set=scale[2400],env[live],output_format[png],sku_number[200165934],sku_dir[200165]%26call=url[file:san/com/sku.chain]
 besser82	lisitsyn, can you organize one of these for me in return, plz?  --->  http://besser82.fedorapeople.org/1.jpg
 lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	back
@sonney2k	besser82, yeah I expected that lots of config.h includes are missing...
 besser82	sonney2k: ~150 files were affected
 besser82	lisitsyn:  two or three sticker would be enough  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  not a whole banner ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: not sure what sticker you are talknig about!
 besser82	lisitsyn:  those russian openstack ones  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  btw.  what's written on them?
 lisitsyn	let me try to translate
 besser82	sonney2k: the real tough thing is about the interfaces
 lisitsyn	from each according to his abilities, cloud to each??
 lisitsyn	makes no sense
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is just a rephrase of a common russian phrase
 besser82	lisitsyn: :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: but sounds good, in context of openStack
 besser82	lisitsyn: openStack is an easy to deploy cloud
 besser82	lisitsyn: you can run that on one metal, in fact
 besser82	lisitsyn: or deploy a complete datacenter within 10 minutes using pxe
 besser82	sonney2k: are you lost again?!?
@sonney2k	besser82, what is the issue with the interfaces?
 besser82	sonney2k: there is lots of this and that...
@sonney2k	?
 besser82	sonney2k: biggest problem is the config.h for now...
 besser82	sonney2k: which should solve ~85% of my problems
 besser82	sonney2k: the other 15% is tweaking in cmake ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, but that is easy right? you just include it in every .i file and done
@sonney2k	*if* that works
@sonney2k	for me it didn't when I tried
 besser82	sonney2k: that's the fact...
 besser82	sonney2k: and that's why i'm currently stuck with progress
 besser82	sonney2k: I need to find a way to get that going...
 besser82	sonney2k: digging into swig internals....
-!- zxtx_ [~zv@129-79-241-148.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
 besser82	sonney2k: hahahahahahahahah
 besser82	sonney2k: got the solution, I think....
@sonney2k	besser82, don't say defines :D
 besser82	sonney2k: %module example
 besser82	 %{
 besser82	 /* Includes the header in the wrapper code */
 besser82	 #include "config.h"
 besser82	 %}
 besser82	 
 besser82	 /* Parse the header file to generate wrappers */
 besser82	 %include "config.h"
 besser82	...
 besser82	#ifdef {HAVE,USE}_XXX
@sonney2k	besser82, but IIRC you will have to do that in *each* .i file
@sonney2k	using e.g. config.i that does that won't work right?
@sonney2k	(and including it)
 besser82	sonney2k: now got got me on an idea...  :D
 besser82	sonney2k: lemme try...
 besser82	sonney2k: That f*cking works !!!!  :D  config.i  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k:  works when having that in toplevel.i, too  ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, you mean just in toplevel modshogun.i?
 besser82	sonney2k: so I just needed to inject that sniplet into modshogun.i
 besser82	sonney2k: very top most
 besser82	sonney2k: and YEAH!!!
 besser82	sonney2k: the config.h is present and gets used by swig && in *_wrap.cpp
@sonney2k	besser82, and the defines are really catched up?
 besser82	sonney2k: yes
 besser82	sonney2k: swig uses them when generating that *_wrap.cpp
 besser82	sonney2k: and the *_wrap.cpp picks config.h as first include to resolve all left #ifdefs
 besser82	sonney2k: that speeds up module build by far!!!
 besser82	sonney2k: another 600% speed-gain on building the interfaces  :D
 besser82	sonney2k: but there is more to squeeze out...
@sonney2k	besser82, whats the matter?
 besser82	sonney2k: SPEEEEEEEED  :)
 besser82	sonney2k: there is more speed to squeeze out, I see just by looking on those *.i
@sonney2k	besser82, later later
@sonney2k	we have to get something that works first
 besser82	sonney2k: that's not a big thing  ;)
@sonney2k	remember - make it run, make it clean, make it fast
 besser82	sonney2k: just obsoleting the left-over cli-defines  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: like da -DSWIGPYTHON
 besser82	sonney2k: and such
 besser82	sonney2k: generate some swig_conf.{h,i} in cmake and all is fine ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, no siwgpython is defined by swig itself
 besser82	sonney2k: kk, as you say...
 besser82	sonney2k: ahh....
 besser82	sonney2k: renaming that modshogun.i to ${INTERFACE}_modshogun.i speeds stuff up when using ccaches  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: nothing big, but effective ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: when everything will run as expected, I should be done tommorow
 besser82	sonney2k: then we just need to do a bit of testing and can do the 3.1-release
@sonney2k	besser82, maybe we can have a $interface_modshogun.i and a modshogun.i that includes the interface specific part?
 besser82	sonney2k: also possible as well
 besser82	sonney2k: you're talking about that inlined-stuff && those *.i in the corresponding *_modular dir, rye?
 besser82	sonney2k: might possibly give even more speedup  :D
 besser82	sonney2k: YEAH!  The first shogun-release which builds in < 5 mins on -j8  :-P
@sonney2k	besser82, well as long as it builds interfaces from already installed shogun headers I am happy :D
@sonney2k	besser82, yes I am talking about that massacre in modshogun.i
@sonney2k	I think this is the only file that is *that* bad
 besser82	sonney2k: that's the next step to do for me ---> interf. from existing libshogun.so
 besser82	sonney2k: right after cleaning out the mess in modshogun.i  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: and make sure all interfaces work as expected, e.g. don't crash && pass testsuite
 besser82	sonney2k: btw. testsuite  ---> that ow runs complety from inside the build-tree  :D
 besser82	sonney2k: not need for `make install`
 besser82	sonney2k: just `ctest $my_options ..` and go go
 besser82	sonney2k: will go to bed now and start quite soon tommorow morning
@sonney2k	besser82, nice!
 besser82	sonney2k: I think we should be able to release with (well tested) new cmake stuff before "Heilige drei K?nige"  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: so before end of "Feiertage"  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: or at least "Schulferien" :-P
 besser82	sonney2k: would that timeline be ok for you?
 besser82	sonney2k: like having the PR somewhen during tommorow / new year
@sonney2k	on the 1st would be nice then I am back to work...
 besser82	sonney2k: ok, but the someone needs to test that stuff with MacOS after PR  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: and with Cygwin && MSVC
 besser82	sonney2k: Cygwin && MSVC I can do, at least basically on windows 8
 besser82	sonney2k: But you are the one with a mac, I guess  :-P
 besser82	sonney2k: allrighty, off to bed now  ;)
@sonney2k	besser82, well to me linux is most important
@sonney2k	at least for the moment
 besser82	sonney2k: hehe, for me too  :-P
 besser82	sonney2k: Who uses that other crap  :-P
 besser82	sonney2k: and on linux it will run for sure ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: and now I'm really off to bed  :-P
