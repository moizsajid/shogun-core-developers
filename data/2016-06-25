@HeikoS	sanuj: jo
@HeikoS	now I have some itme
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	i have a problem
 sanuj	wait i'll push the code
@HeikoS	ok !
@HeikoS	sanuj: btw did you see my email for midterm update?
@HeikoS	sanuj: can you cc me in the daily update email?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: jo
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: yo
 sanuj	HeikoS, the error is caused in this region
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-4a319646835bd87fa05b41d8b1872184R22
 sanuj	HeikoS, here is the error http://pastebin.com/eFrBNL51
@HeikoS	sanuj: so what shappening?
 sanuj	HeikoS, yeah, i'll start sending mails from monday....
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool thanks for that!
 sanuj	HeikoS, did you see the error?
@HeikoS	sanuj: I see it, but can you point me the the things important?
 sanuj	i think any destructor deletes member variables
 sanuj	any.h destructor
 sanuj	HeikoS, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8ea96286d95b52029d31636117e0fe55R149
@HeikoS	whats a minimal example?
@HeikoS	is there one in the PR?
@HeikoS	sanuj: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8ea96286d95b52029d31636117e0fe55R98
@HeikoS	this line deletes memory
@HeikoS	right?
@HeikoS	BZDMG: jo
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	BZDMG is away i think
 sanuj	HeikoS, why is the destructor being called
@HeikoS	sanuj: can you put the test that segfaults into its own main
@HeikoS	and then run again, share the output
@HeikoS	of valgrind
@HeikoS	the current one is convoluted so much with gtest
 sanuj	okay, let me do that
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: how are things?
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: I have kept the duplicate indices,

 Saurabh7__	I believe they are justified
 Saurabh7__	I checked
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: ok
@HeikoS	can you share someevidence for that with me? :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, what is HeikoS_web
@HeikoS	sanuj: thats my work computer logged in via webinterface
@HeikoS	but it is in london
@HeikoS	and I am in France
@HeikoS	escaping the brexit
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: HeikoS for e.g https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Approach
 Saurabh7__	so sampling with replacement
 Saurabh7__	am i right?
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7__: can you also check sklearn impl?
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: I checked
 Saurabh7__	its very different in terms of approach, has been changed with time
 Saurabh7__	dups are allowed
 Saurabh7__	but they handle it with sample weights
 Saurabh7__	like bincount(samples)
 Saurabh7__	and use it somehow
 Saurabh7__	so the idea is same tho
@HeikoS	okok
@HeikoS	so lets continue with things then
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: antoher thing, presortin I have kept optional still
 Saurabh7__	because in sinlge tree we train on subset
 Saurabh7__	so cant presort inside it
 Saurabh7__	so I do it in RF
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	thats ok then
 Saurabh7__	cool
 Saurabh7__	HeikoS: ok I will add some doc in t current PR and some tests are needed
@HeikoS	yep
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'm not able to compile this
 sanuj	temp.cpp:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `shogun::init_shogun_with_defaults()'
 sanuj	error ^
@HeikoS	dude
@HeikoS	 :)
@HeikoS	so lets see
@HeikoS	you know what an undefined reference means?
@HeikoS	I mean the error, what causes it=?
 sanuj	no
 sanuj	not able to link it
@HeikoS	sanuj: so that happens
@HeikoS	if you can compile a program
@HeikoS	that is, turn the program.c into program.o
@HeikoS	so all header files were available
@HeikoS	in the linking step, all the .o files are put together into the binary
@HeikoS	now,
@HeikoS	if there is a method that does not appear in one of the .o files linked together (that is, no implementation of the defined function)
@HeikoS	then you get linker error
@HeikoS	if the method is in a third party lib, like your init_shogun_with_defaults
@HeikoS	then, this means you linker cannot see any library that contains an implementation of the method
@HeikoS	sanuj: I suggest you read up on how c/c++ compiler work
@HeikoS	in practice, it means your forgot -lshogun
 sanuj	HeikoS, i compiled with => g++ --std=c++11 -I/home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/src/ -L/home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/buildpy/src/shogun -lshogun temp.cpp
@HeikoS	this tells the linker where to look for .so files
@HeikoS	if you put the -lshogun but still get the error
@HeikoS	this means that you LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain the file
@HeikoS	so either your -L option is wrong
@HeikoS	or there is no file there
@HeikoS	it is one of the most basic errors when compiling c++
 sanuj	my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is /home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/buildpy/src/shogun:/home/sanuj/torch/install/lib:
@HeikoS	so no reason to ask more than once ;)
 sanuj	and the path in -L is also correct
@HeikoS	sanuj: nope
@HeikoS	because if it was, it would wortk
@HeikoS	does your -L path contain modshogun.so?
 sanuj	that path has libshogun.so
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	well, I dont know, there are 100 mini things that can be set wrongly
@HeikoS	but the rationale is usper simple
@HeikoS	linker cannot find init_shogun_with_defaults
@HeikoS	thats it
@HeikoS	you have to tell it where it is
@HeikoS	and it will work
 sanuj	HeikoS, this worked
 sanuj	g++ --std=c++11 -I/home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/src/ -L/home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/buildpy/src/shogun temp.cpp -lshogun
 sanuj	swapping temp.cpp and -lshogun
@HeikoS	sanuj: ah yeah that also is a thing to consider
@HeikoS	sanuj: try to read up on why
@HeikoS	so next time someone asks here, you can explain them
 sanuj	HeikoS, okay thanks
@HeikoS	;)
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	btw i know c++ linker and compiler basics
 sanuj	everything was correct but it was not working that's why i asked here
@HeikoS	sanuj: sure
@HeikoS	sanuj: I only explained
@HeikoS	since the question
@HeikoS	to make sure you are on track with this
@HeikoS	since there is only one answer to the question: the linker doesnt see libshogun.so
@HeikoS	but all good
@HeikoS	the mkl cookbooks look nice btw

@HeikoS	just in case
 sanuj	:P
@HeikoS	checking the error
 sanuj	cool
@HeikoS	can you put this as a gist, and also put the example code
 sanuj	okay
 shogun-buildbot	build #739 of trusty - libshogun - viennacl is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/trusty%20-%20libshogun%20-%20viennacl/builds/739  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, OXPHOS <engelzora@gmail.com>

@HeikoS	and no ads
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	HeikoS, https://gist.github.com/sanuj/695d881295c060d5fbb99abd3552fcbb
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok thanks, thats much easier to look at
 sanuj	HeikoS, did you guys go to deepmind?
@HeikoS	not yet
@HeikoS	probably next week
 sanuj	okay :D
@HeikoS	is the code in your PR exactly the same as when you ran the example?
 sanuj	i read some of their research papers....cool stuff
@HeikoS	yeah they do interesthing work
@HeikoS	and lots of really good people
 sanuj	HeikoS, code is same as PR
@HeikoS	sanuj: what happens if you remove the line 16 in your example?
@HeikoS	same error?
 sanuj	it segfaults
 sanuj	HeikoS, i think the error is in init_params() of mock object
@HeikoS	sanuj: ^
 sanuj	HeikoS, any destructor deletes the member variable
 sanuj	any.h destructor
 sanuj	not sure though
 sanuj	==15743==    at 0x4026FD: shogun::Any::~Any() (in /home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/buildpy/a.out)
@HeikoS	sanuj: can you remove the set and tell me what happens?
@HeikoS	line 16
 sanuj	5 mins
 sanuj	doorbell
@HeikoS	kk
 sanuj	removing all sets
@HeikoS	sanuj:
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	just line 16 in example
@HeikoS	and add it to the gist
@HeikoS	dont overwrite the old
@HeikoS	so that we can compare
 sanuj	oh i had removed set in MockObject and built it
 sanuj	undoing and rebuilding
 sanuj	HeikoS, do you know someone in UCL who works on deep learning related stuff and can take interns like me for 6 months or so
 sanuj	or anywhere else also apart from UCL
@HeikoS	sanuj: if you wanna do deeplearning, better go to deepmind
@HeikoS	they took all good people
@HeikoS	but I know a few folds at UCL
@HeikoS	whod o ml
 sanuj	HeikoS, deepmind wont take people with just undergraduate degrees
@HeikoS	i see
@HeikoS	internships are good
@HeikoS	need to find some good group
@HeikoS	that matches you
 sanuj	HeikoS, really?
 sanuj	i have been mailing profs but no one replies back :P
@HeikoS	sanuj: haha!
@HeikoS	people are busy
@HeikoS	and they get mails like this all the time
@HeikoS	who did you write?
 sanuj	well i say that
 sanuj	i have read your recent work
 sanuj	respect what you do and would like to work with you to be a part of it
 sanuj	and send my CV
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	who, not what
 sanuj	i updated the gist
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	lol
 sanuj	David hsu from NUS - works on robotics and reinforcement learning
 sanuj	Nando de freitas
 sanuj	honglak lee
-!- GandalfTheWizard [~Eva@112.10.171.169] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	they are all too busy
 sanuj	^ univ of michigan
 sanuj	satinder singh from univ of michigan too
 sanuj	and some other profs who work on deep reinforcement learning and related stuff
 sanuj	now i have switched to mailing PhDs working in good labs to ask if they have a vacancy
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	they usually cannot decide
@HeikoS	ah it is hard
@HeikoS	to stick out of the noise
@HeikoS	I get lots of emails from indian students actually
 sanuj	HeikoS, haha
@HeikoS	but takes too much time to answer all
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	HeikoS, tell me if you find a good group, i would like to join after gsoc
@HeikoS	sanuj: what do you want to do?
@HeikoS	that is the biggest question
 sanuj	HeikoS, i like what deepmind is doing
 sanuj	anything related to that
 sanuj	but i'm flexible
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	and which place?
@HeikoS	you like?
 sanuj	USA, Canada, UK, Europe, Singapore
 sanuj	HeikoS, will it be difficult in germany if i don't know german? :D
@HeikoS	sanuj: some unis have english speaking groups
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok so we get the same error when you remobed the set
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	ok
 sanuj	it is from init_param()
@HeikoS	so my hunch is: your tag implementation tries to delete the member variable
@HeikoS	since its happening in Any destructor
 sanuj	yes, i think the same
 sanuj	but we need a way around it
 sanuj	i thought about removing that from any.h destructor and using something like SG_REMOVE
@HeikoS	I dont understand the problem fully yet
 sanuj	SG_FREE*
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	can you maybe re-build your example without optimizations?
@HeikoS	so it doesnt say
@HeikoS	at 0x4024A9: shogun::Any::~Any() (in /home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/buildpy/a.out)
-!- GandalfTheWizard [~Eva@112.10.171.169] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	but gives the line number at the end?
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	I dont understand why the desctructor is called
 sanuj	HeikoS, debug mode in cmake?
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	sanuj: check the error output
@HeikoS	shogun's line numbers are there
@HeikoS	but not the ones of your example
@HeikoS	there if only sais a.out
@HeikoS	but no line number
 sanuj	oh i see
@HeikoS	sanuj: so the problem is: registering member variables in the parameter map
@HeikoS	we are already down to that
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	updated?
 sanuj	HeikoS, i used g++ -O0
 sanuj	not getting the line numbers
@HeikoS	there is a debug option
@HeikoS	that includes line number infos
 sanuj	HeikoS, updating
 sanuj	HeikoS, updated
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	the example line numbers dont matcht he listing you put
@HeikoS	line 17 in error message is nothing
@HeikoS	I think since you remove a line
 sanuj	HeikoS, it's line 12 in the error message for temp.cpp
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	ok then
@HeikoS	so why is desctructor called?
@HeikoS	of any
@HeikoS	CSGObject::485
@HeikoS	erase_type
@HeikoS	why is that done?
@HeikoS	did you maybe update the "overwritign" machanism and forget to consider the case where something is newly added to the parameter map?
 sanuj	HeikoS, erase_type creates an object of Any
 sanuj	using the value from the argument
 sanuj	because parameter map stores string --> any
 sanuj	HeikoS, sorry, it stores BaseTag ---> any
 sanuj	HeikoS, the diff between public set and protected set is that public set only sets if the provided basetag already exists in the map
@HeikoS	sanuj: maybe a better name should be chosen
@HeikoS	like "add"
@HeikoS	or so
@HeikoS	and "set" is for public use
 sanuj	currently it is _set
 sanuj	i'll use add
@HeikoS	so why is any destructor called?
 sanuj	even i'm asking the same question
@HeikoS	from erase_value?
@HeikoS	erase_type(
 sanuj	HeikoS, i had used the exact same method in the old implementation
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8ea96286d95b52029d31636117e0fe55R210
 sanuj	i just made it protected
@HeikoS	there you return by value
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	sanuj: so the way to solve this
@HeikoS	is to use a debugger
@HeikoS	and to go through the code step by step
@HeikoS	understand what it does
@HeikoS	I cannot do that from the PR
@HeikoS	since I cannot brwose the code
 sanuj	i'll do that
@HeikoS	too many redirections for my mind :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: you know how to use gdb?
@HeikoS	or ddd maybe?
 sanuj	now i'll find learn it from somewhere
@HeikoS	if you already compiled with debug symbols it is easy
@HeikoS	which OS?
 sanuj	mint
 sanuj	which is ubunut
 sanuj	ubuntu
@HeikoS	ok install "ddd"
-!- GandalfTheWizard [~Eva@112.10.171.169] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@HeikoS	sanuj:  and then start it, and just load your a.out
@HeikoS	then set a breakpoint before the line 12
@HeikoS	and then run
@HeikoS	and then to "single steps"
 sanuj	HeikoS, btw can you merge https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3283
@HeikoS	if it goes to far in, you can always "step return"
 sanuj	this is holding my neural net cookbook since 2 weeks
@HeikoS	sanuj: did you ever use any debugger?
@HeikoS	i.e. you know "step next" "step return" etc?
@HeikoS	and breakpoints
@HeikoS	?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	i know
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	so ddd does that for your c
@HeikoS	binary
@HeikoS	given it is compiled with debug mode
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	oh wow, it has a gui
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: so use that to find out whats wrong
@HeikoS	you can just read what all the variables are
@HeikoS	good exercise to understand c memory errors ;)
 sanuj	doing
@HeikoS	sanuj: I am here for a bit more, let me know your findings
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	sanuj:  and?
 sanuj	i set a breakpoint on line 11
 sanuj	10 actually
 sanuj	then i do next
 sanuj	 and it reaches the any destructor
 sanuj	HeikoS, ^
@HeikoS	you gotta do single steps
@HeikoS	or put the breakpoint earlier, sometimes ddd is confusing
@HeikoS	"step in"
@HeikoS	not "step over"
@HeikoS	step over exectues all code by the active line
@HeikoS	but you want to jump  inside the call
 sanuj	HeikoS, there is "step" and "next"
@HeikoS	sanuj: I dont know how they are called
 sanuj	"next" says = proceeding through subroutine calls
@HeikoS	but if it goes to destructor, it obvioulsy tries to execute the whole line
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	oh okay
 sanuj	wait
@HeikoS	gotta go
@HeikoS	sanuj: will check back later tonight
@HeikoS	feel free to send an email
@HeikoS	should be easy to track the problem with the ddd
@HeikoS	sanuj: see you!
 sanuj	HeikoS, cool
 sanuj	thanks
@HeikoS	thanks to you too! :)
