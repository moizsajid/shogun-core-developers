 heiko	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	heiko: yeah
 heiko	blackburn, do the vw python examples also fail in current shogun git?
 heiko	wondering if I broke it before or just now with my latest changes :)
 blackburn	heiko: I have no idea actually :D
 blackburn	it is a deep forest
 heiko	blackburn, are you able to quickly run latest git make tests?
 heiko	blackburn, I finally finished my changes on the streaming framework, this is the last obstacle  :)
 heiko	blackburn, oh wait, the buildbot knows, I forgot :D
 blackburn	heiko: heh sorry got distracted
 heiko	blackburn, just saw that the complex serialization example fails again, might have to do with the recent bugfix from the mailinglist
 blackburn	heiko: I failed to recognize that error
 blackburn	heiko: have you seen that workaround I posted?
 blackburn	it fixes inplace new of SGString
 blackburn	actually I totally misunderstand why it fails..
 heiko	blackburn, yeah I have noticed, but not looked properly yet
 heiko	blackburn, the serialization is evil stuff ;)
 blackburn	heiko: I want boost serialization  :D
 heiko	ah I see the vw python examples fail in current gut
 heiko	blackburn, I think that would make things even worse
 blackburn	heiko: I am not sure it would
 heiko	We just need to pay some attention to the current system. It basically works
 heiko	but all the recent changes fucked it
 heiko	the SGVector stuff mainly did :)
 heiko	but I will have a look soon
 heiko	will commit the streaming stuff now and then fix the examples and then start on it maybe
 blackburn	okay lets see your changes
 heiko	big patch tp come :)
 heiko	just a minute
 heiko	will merge now :)
 heiko	Ill go to the gym now, be back later in the evening to see what I broke :D
 heiko	but all tests passed here though
 blackburn	heiko: okay lets see
 blackburn	have a nice gym :)
 heiko	blackburn, one more thing: I had the idea that we could post all new features (that would go to the NEWS) to the shogun twitter
 heiko	but gotta run now, lets talk about it later
 blackburn	oooooooooops
 blackburn	TWITTER
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I forgot
 blackburn	totally
 blackburn	absolutely
 heiko	great, I will do that later then :)
 heiko	see you!
