 chintak	hey anyone there
 chintak	I'm completely new to shogun and trying to figure out how to use it
 chintak	I'm trying to use RandomForest in shogun
 chintak	It fails when I call the train method after initializing the features and labels
 chintak	The python interface complains - "label type not supported". I am using BinaryLabel.
 chintak	Pls help
 chintak	@lisitsyn: could you tell me how to use RandomForest?
@wiking	mmm that error what u r quoting cannot be found in the whole src of the project
 chintak	SystemError: [ERROR] In file /home/chintaksheth/libs/shogun/src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp line 77: label type supplied is not supported
@wiking	well
@wiking	why do u want to use regression
@wiking	BinaryLabel.?
 chintak	I want to do classification
 chintak	rf = RandomForest(feats_train, labels, 10, 1)
 chintak	feats_train has RealFeatures
@wiking	yeah that's ok
 chintak	labels is BinaryLabels
 chintak	yes
 chintak	next I called rf.train()
@wiking	cart tree is being used in regression
 chintak	hmm
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	as a quick fix
@wiking	try to use multiclass labels
 chintak	Ok
@wiking	CMulticlassLabels
 chintak	ok, works now
 chintak	but it is reasonable to expect BinaryLabels to work, right?
@wiking	it is totally reasonable
@wiking	but it needs to be fixed :)
 chintak	:)
 chintak	the notebooks and cloud is inactive?

 chintak	How should I debug the C++ code?
 chintak	All I get is: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'shogun::ShogunException'
 chintak	Aborted (core dumped)
 chintak	In python SystemError messages are displayed, but unfortunately in C++ I don't get any such messages
 chintak	I compiled Shogun using CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug and in my C++ code using -O0 -ggdb
