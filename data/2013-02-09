 sumit	Oh cool BlackBurn :) :) , just returned from the classes and read your reply :) I shall get it done in an hour or so and get right back to you :) , thanks..Yet I feel I should grasp more about shogun toolbox b4 I develope codes compatible with Shogun :)
 sumit	thanks !
 blackburn	sumit: keep calm - you don't need to hurry

 n4nd0	wiking: so make in the tests dir run smooth yesterday
 n4nd0	the tests are the ones under tests/integration right?
 wiking	noup tests are under tests/unit
 n4nd0	wiking: aham I see
 n4nd0	so they have to be built apart too?
 wiking	well if u run make in tests/unit
 wiking	then they'll be built
 n4nd0	I run yesterday make under tests I think
 n4nd0	mmm no that cannot be
 wiking	try to run a make under tests/unit
 wiking	you should see some info about the unit tests if everything is ok
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	make is failing under tests/unit now for some reason
 wiking	ok check the reason
 n4nd0	a method is not found in CDataGenerator
 wiking	mmmm interesting
 n4nd0	a method that actually seems to be there
 n4nd0	generate_gaussians
 wiking	mmm maybe it's because i think that func needs some lib
 wiking	like lapack or something?
 n4nd0	right
 n4nd0	probably I don't have it installed here
 n4nd0	checking configure
 n4nd0	wiking: I think that lapack is not detected by configure
 n4nd0	can you check one thing a moment please?
 n4nd0	I have seen that in the configure script there are checks for -llapack
 n4nd0	however here whereis llapack doesn't find anything
 n4nd0	I have to use whereis liblapack
 n4nd0	it might be a naming thing?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	well i guess it's more like it doesn't have the right library path to find your lapack
 n4nd0	nvm
 n4nd0	I checked configure.log, cblas.h is not found
 n4nd0	installing atm
 n4nd0	 /usr/bin/ld: libgmock.a(gtest-all.o): undefined reference to symbol 'pthread_key_delete@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
 n4nd0	 /usr/bin/ld: note: 'pthread_key_delete@@GLIBC_2.2.5' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 so try adding it to the linker command line
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	i wonder why you dont have -pthread or -lpthread added to your linker flags
 n4nd0	-pthread is included
 n4nd0	the line that is just before the undefined reference message
 n4nd0	c++ -I../../src -fPIC  -g -Wall -Werror-implicit-function-declaration -Wno-unused-parameter -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wparentheses -Wshadow -Wno-deprecated -O0 -pthread -I/usr/include -I/usr/src/gmock/include -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=shogun -DSHOGUN -DLINUX -DUSE_BOOL -DUSE_CHAR -DUSE_UINT8 -DUSE_UINT16 -DUSE_INT32 -DUSE_INT64 -DUSE_UINT64 -DUSE_FLOAT32 -DUSE_FLOAT64 -DHAVE_POWL -DHAVE_LGAMMAL -DHAVE_SQRTL -DHAVE_LOG2 -DHAVE_PTHREAD -DHAVE_
 wiking	mmm
 n4nd0	pthread is in there ^
 wiking	can u replace -pthread with -lpthread
 wiking	i mean just prepend the thing with l ;P
 n4nd0	hehe I just copied the line and added the l
 n4nd0	no error then
 wiking	mmm this needs to be fixed
 wiking	i just wonder how can we fix this
 n4nd0	where are those flags set?
 wiking	i guess the flag -pthread and -lpthread has changed
 wiking	in one gcc version
 wiking	what's your gcc version?
 n4nd0	4.7.2
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	interesting
 n4nd0	why?
 wiking	so it's kind of like the latest
 wiking	because i thought that the older gcc had -lpthread flag
 wiking	and the newer ones switched to -pthread
 n4nd0	I don't really understand why it fails with -pthread
 n4nd0	I thought they were basically quite the same
 wiking	yeah me too
 wiking	i thought that it's just a version difference
 wiking	in gcc
 wiking	 '-lpthread' means 'link with a library called pthread'.
 wiking	        '-pthread' means 'do whatever you have to do to compile code that
 wiking	complies with the pthreads standard so that it works'.
 wiking	        '-lpthread' should not be used if '-pthread' is available unless you
 wiking	have some very specific reason.
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	interesting
 wiking	but obviously -pthread doesn't work for ya
 wiking	:>
 n4nd0	hehe yeah it seems so
 wiking	so it did not do everything to get your code compiled
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	this is weird
 n4nd0	I am checking my gcc specs
 n4nd0	and I think it actually links with -lpthread

 n4nd0	blackburn: ey
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey
 n4nd0	blackburn: have you seen this pthread issue ^?
 blackburn	no, what is it?
 n4nd0	so
 n4nd0	-pthread gives me a compile error that is solved when I use -lpthread
 n4nd0	but it seems from gcc that -pthread is actually also linking with -lpthread
 blackburn	interesting
 blackburn	does that happen only on your machine?
 n4nd0	no idea
 n4nd0	I guess wiking could compile without the erro
 n4nd0	anyhow, gtg now maybe I can check it with him later
 n4nd0	see you

 heiko1	sonney2k, blackburn, around?
 blackburn	heiko1: yes
 heiko1	already idea for gsoc projects?
 heiko1	blackburn, I might have a nice one, and thinking of others, but wondering what you guys have in mind
 blackburn	heiko1: well just suggest :)
 blackburn	heiko1: I would like to have one dim reduction student
 blackburn	heiko1: soeren asked andreas ziehe for ICA stuff
 blackburn	heiko1: I will try to convince igor carron to lead something about compressive sensing
 heiko1	ICA nice :)
 heiko1	I would like to do something on computing Gaussian likelihoods for large models
 heiko1	which involves iterative linear solvers, graph colourings, and sparse matrices
 heiko1	blackburn, and would allow MCMC on those large models
 heiko1	which is currently very very hard
 heiko1	so a truly large-scale project :)
 heiko1	I know a few people who could help me mentoring it
 blackburn	heiko1: go ahead then :)
 heiko1	cool, do we already have an ideas page?
 blackburn	heiko1: would be nice if you describe it
 heiko1	to put a description?
 blackburn	not yet but I will add
 blackburn	yes
 heiko1	cool, so I will write a bit on this
 blackburn	I hope we will get enough slots :D
 blackburn	ah wait
 blackburn	I hope we will get accepted
 blackburn	ah wait
 blackburn	I hope gsoc will be announced

 heiko1	blackburn, hehe :)
 heiko1	we will probably get many slots (if we can get as many mentors as last years)

@sonney2k	heiko1, I was hoping that you would rather mentor this year
@sonney2k	heiko1, you can do your fun project anyways
 heiko1	sonney2k, I was talking about mentoring this one
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm I realized I don't get whether heiko1 wants to mentor it or be a student
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	I am not a student in the summer :)
 blackburn	I thought so!
 heiko1	sonney2k, dont worry :)
 blackburn	right - you told that yesterday heiko1
 heiko1	sonney2k, two more mentors this year
 blackburn	it is difficult to live without brain..
 blackburn	heiko1: or three
 heiko1	what? :)
 blackburn	heiko1: you mean two = you and me?
 blackburn	or?
 heiko1	oh
 heiko1	yes
 blackburn	then count wiking - he could mentor too
 heiko1	blackburn, ok :) but with you and me I am sure
 blackburn	parteigenosse wiking is reliable!
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	haha :)
 blackburn	heiko1: I tried to learn a bit of deutsch from 1992 book - they say I shouldn't call people genosse anymore but it is ok still
 blackburn	that was kind of funny
