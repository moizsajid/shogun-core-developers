 gsomix	sonney2k, oh, we cannot use hashset for MemoryBlocks.
 gsomix	because we add MemoryBlock(ptr, size) and remove MemoryBlock(prt) - different hashes.
 gsomix	I will replace CSet to CMap<void* ptr, MemoryBlock>. ok?

 blackburn	pluskid: hey
 blackburn	it looks like recent commits caused this error
 blackburn	it appeared on my machine too
 pluskid	blackburn: I think I already fix this error locally
 blackburn	pluskid: what caused it?
 pluskid	hmm, let me think...
 pluskid	ahh
 pluskid	I see
 pluskid	virtual void add_machine_subset(SGVector<index_t> subset)
 pluskid	this method in CMulticlassMachine
 pluskid	becomes virtual void add_machine_subset(const SGVector<index_t> subset)
 pluskid	in CLinearMulticlassMachine
 pluskid	one more const
 blackburn	haha
 pluskid	then SWIG confused
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.149.21.227] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
 blackburn	sure it is different methods
 pluskid	but C++ example runs without problem
 blackburn	pluskid: const should be everywhere here I guess
 blackburn	do you think so?
 blackburn	ah init_machines shouldn't be
 pluskid	blackburn: but I don't think they are different in C++ here
 pluskid	I mean copy and const copy
 blackburn	pluskid: hmm anyway to be fixed
 pluskid	fixing some other errors
 pluskid	segfault, etc
 blackburn	pluskid: shall I wait for yor pr or fix it?
 pluskid	blackburn: btw: I also fixed the error you mentioned before, ECOC producing 0 in binary labels
 blackburn	your*
 blackburn	oh that's nice
 blackburn	I forgot to send an example sorry
 pluskid	I'll push my current fixes
 pluskid	now
 blackburn	ok I'll merge it then
 pluskid	the remaining segfaults seems not easy to find in a moment
 blackburn	btw did you recover?
 pluskid	not yet, but much better
 blackburn	I had some illness yesterday and now I'm going to fix a few bugs
 pluskid	blackburn: get well
 blackburn	you too :)
 pluskid	I'm afraid I have to go to the hospital again tomorrow :p
 pluskid	blackburn: here comes the pull request
 blackburn	thanks!
 pluskid	I'll continue to hunt the other segfault
 pluskid	blackburn: do you know how to tell where's the fault when the python example simply say segfault and print nothing?

 blackburn	merged

 pluskid	totally not understand Russian
 blackburn	pluskid: you don't have to understand they are fighting :D
 pluskid	hmm

 blackburn	pluskid: yeah
 blackburn	pluskid: tomorrow putin is going to become a president officially - that's why people rally
 pluskid	blackburn: Vladimir Putin ?
 blackburn	yes that piece of shit

 blackburn	sonney2k: hey
@sonney2k	blackburn, hey
@sonney2k	I wonder why now some pythonmodular examples fail
@sonney2k	I mean some in converters that were working before...
 blackburn	sonney2k: one solution could be to merge my libedrt stuff
 blackburn	makes no use of sgvectors actually
@sonney2k	hmmh even libshogun examples fail now
@sonney2k	they all worked yesterday?!
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	wtf?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.ridus.ru/_ah/img/eCD9fzuY-qrshjm73wvAnw again
 blackburn	sonney2k: let me focus on libedrt - this code is going to be obsolete anyway

@sonney2k	blackburn, you cannot use SGMatrix in LINRECONSTRUCTION_THREAD_PARAM
@sonney2k	or any of the objects on stack
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I know
@sonney2k	SG_MALLOC won't work for that
@sonney2k	you have to use a ptr or explicit fields
 blackburn	sonney2k: sg_malloc for what?
@sonney2k	SG_MALLOC(LINRECONSTRUCTION_THREAD_PARAM, 10)
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	sonney2k: anyway it is obsolete
@sonney2k	but we have to fix this first
@sonney2k	it is not a good idea to merge some new version at this stage
@sonney2k	otherwise we risk to not getting back to a stable state
 blackburn	sonney2k: right, but this could be useless..
 blackburn	sonney2k: but why SG_MALLOC does not fit there?
 blackburn	for threads I mean
@sonney2k	it never fits
@sonney2k	when objects need to be allocated
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you suggest new?
@sonney2k	one needs new []() for that
@sonney2k	I suggest to not use objects
@sonney2k	in these structs
@sonney2k	(ptrs are ok though)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am changing it to pointers
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have birch trees in berlin?
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r7d802f1 / src/shogun/machine/KernelMachine.cpp :
 CIA-113	shogun: don't use Objects in structs allocated via SG_MALLOC
 CIA-113	shogun: - convert SGVector to ptr*, len - http://git.io/8kBlDA
@sonney2k	gsomix, please explain
 gsomix	sonney2k, a?
 blackburn	someone has a bad mood :D
 gsomix	T____T
@sonney2k	gsomix, a?
@sonney2k	you asked sth above ...

-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.165.53] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, ah. we add MemoryBlock(ptr, size) in sg_mallocs.
 gsomix	and remove MemoryBlock(ptr).
 CIA-113	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r3bc5f3e / (3 files): Fixed crashers in converters - http://git.io/2bTG5Q
 blackburn	was trivial
 gsomix	MemoryBlock(ptr, size) and MemoryBlock(ptr) have different hashes.
@sonney2k	ah ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, so did you fix it?
 gsomix	sonney2k, in progress.
 blackburn	sonney2k: one multiclass example and modelselection are b0rken
 blackburn	almost ok
 blackburn	I will take care of multiclass crasher
@sonney2k	blackburn, if things are back to normal we can continue with SGMatrix and friends
@sonney2k	shouldn't be as intrusive (not so many things use it...)
 blackburn	I'll try to fix multiclass today
 blackburn	tomorrow I'm out - exam on 8th
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8264e5c / (src/shogun/features/Subset.cpp src/shogun/features/Subset.h): no longer copy subset index - http://git.io/zSy7GQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, k
@sonney2k	multilass seems not so easy ...
@sonney2k	something wrong with subsets
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, gf said now that you looks very nice :) just funny fact
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: it can be the same issue in evaluation, modelselection and multiclass
 blackburn	I bet it is
@sonney2k	gsomix, haha - probably because picture was taken when I was your age
@sonney2k	well +7 I guess :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah
@sonney2k	easier for heiko to fix this
 blackburn	sonney2k: no in ICML video you are a little younger than now :)
@sonney2k	still not twenty like gsomix
@sonney2k	alright I need sleep
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
 gsomix	sonney2k, we watched videolectures.
 gsomix	good night :)
