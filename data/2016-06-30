@wiking	eh ok
@wiking	lemme se
@wiking	e
@wiking	wtf is liblto_plugin
@wiking	:)
@wiking	lemme just check
@wiking	OXPHOS: which linux do you use?
@wiking	i mean distr+version
 OXPHOS	wiking: suppose to be like this ? - Darwin Kernel Version 14.5.0: Thu Apr 21 20:40:54 PDT 2016; root:xnu-2782.50.3~1/RELEASE_X86_64
@wiking	ah so you are on mac? :)
 OXPHOS	unfortunately yes..
@wiking	no its ok
@wiking	i'm using that as well
@wiking	it should work
@wiking	i.e. worksforme
 OXPHOS	glad to know that..
@wiking	ok so wtf  :)
@wiking	you use brew?
@wiking	i.e. for installing eigen etc?
 OXPHOS	so it requires googlemock during make, and i got error making googlemock, but it is actually run-able
 OXPHOS	yes
 OXPHOS	brew install ninja

@wiking	aaah that's thaaaaaaaaaaaaat ninja
@wiking	and how did you run cmake? :)
 OXPHOS	cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=on ..
@wiking	that will not use ninja yet
@wiking	cmake -GNinja -DENABLE_TESTING=on ..
@wiking	and then run: ninja
 OXPHOS	so I HAVE TO enable ninja everytime? what if i just want a regular make..
 OXPHOS	honestly i'm not totally sure ninja is the reason. but the problem pops up after the install
 OXPHOS	and un-install cannot rescue it..
@wiking	but wait
@wiking	i mean do you want to use ninja or make
@wiking	decide
@wiking	and then see wtf
@wiking	:)
 OXPHOS	wiking: so I have to choose..? make.
@wiking	i dont care
@wiking	ok so then
@wiking	rm -rf build
@wiking	mkdir build
@wiking	cd build
@wiking	cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=on ..
@wiking	make -j2
@wiking	and tell me what's the error
 OXPHOS	wiking: http://pastebin.com/qhZNYPnH
@wiking	did you move this from a windows machine? :)
@wiking	i mean linux
@wiking	because this doesn't make any sense
@wiking	can you please
@wiking	rm -rf /Users/zora/Github/shogun/third_party/
@wiking	and rerun the whole cmake && make
@wiking	and i wonder why /usr/local/bin/ranlib
 OXPHOS	no i didn't..lemme try
@wiking	because it doesn't make sense
@wiking	that it's trying to find .so
@wiking	when in mac it's everything dylib

@wiking	pong
 c4goldsw	Doing well?
 c4goldsw	wiking well, I am!  I'm going down the Grand Canyon in a raft for two weeks, in two days.
 OXPHOS	wiking: I rm -rf build; rm -rf path_to_third party (and I checked manually it IS removed); mkdir and cmake again. I got the same error
 c4goldsw	Trying to wrap up my PR.  I think everything is in order except for a bug I'm getting when trying to compile it: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/140976857#L1527 .  Suggestions?
 c4goldsw	Hey OXPHOS
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: hey! having fun?
 c4goldsw	I am!  It's good to be in the states, the food is great.  And everything is cheap.
 c4goldsw	super cheap
@wiking	c4goldsw: cheking
@wiking	sorry
@wiking	was having some meeting
@wiking	OXPHOS: woaaaaaaaaah :)
 c4goldsw	Ah, its fine.  Where are you based any way?
@wiking	OXPHOS: i need your full make/cmake output
@wiking	c4goldsw: singapore

 c4goldsw	Miri (in Borneo) then KL for six months
 c4goldsw	Between the age of 5 and 10.
@wiking	hehe nice :)
 c4goldsw	Good times
@wiking	c4goldsw: mmm this is weird
@wiking	i'll look into this bug
@wiking	as for now i can only think about that for some reason
@wiking	eigen is not being imported
@wiking	but then again
@wiking	wait a second
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw: haha compared to Europe?
 OXPHOS	wiking: sure
@wiking	c4goldsw: ok so this is gonna hurt us in the long run :S
@wiking	c4goldsw: it's not your thing
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	lemme debug this for you c4goldsw as soon as i have time
@wiking	c4goldsw: if you happen to have the PythonModular compilation on your machine
@wiking	and the same error
 c4goldsw	wiking Wait!  I haven't imported eigen3 in the .cpp file!
 c4goldsw	and Yes
 c4goldsw	But it runs for the non-swig stuff.
@wiking	c4goldsw: which cpp?
 c4goldsw	DenseFeatures.cpp
@wiking	yeah i mean something is with eigen3 not being imported
 c4goldsw	That's where the function is based
 c4goldsw	Ah wait, it is in there, nvm.
@wiking	mmm waht do you mean DenseFeatures.cpp ?:)
@wiking	lemme check on that pr :)

 c4goldsw	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3313/files#diff-f136cb3e4194efacce9b4676f58cabfaR356
 c4goldsw	OXPHOS I lived in a really small community when I was growing up - everyone knew everyone.  It's hard to beat that anywhere.
 c4goldsw	OXPHOS: + being able to run in the Jungle, living next to a beach, being able to cycle to your friend's place and school, etc.
@wiking	typename SGMatrix<ST>::EigenMatrixXtMap eMap = feature_matrix;
 OXPHOS	wiking: http://pastebin.com/X9j1VVi1
@wiking	shoudl be this rather
@wiking	SGMatrix<ST>::EigenMatrixXtMap eMap(feature_matrix)
@wiking	?
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw yeah it's kinda hard to imagine
 OXPHOS	c4goldsw I heard from a French friend that his left led to the huge change of boy-girl balance in his town. Not sure bragging or not XD
@wiking	OXPHOS: whats the output of this ls -la /usr/local/bin/ranlib
 c4goldsw	wiking Ah, now I understand what you were saying
 OXPHOS	wiking: lrwxr-xr-x  1 zora  admin  12 Mar 17 11:06 /usr/local/bin/ranlib -> gcc-ranlib-5
@wiking	ok there's some serious problem with your setup
@wiking	because you are on the one hand
@wiking	using clang as a compiler
@wiking	but then using gcc5's ranlib
 c4goldsw	wiking: What's the difference between the two?
 OXPHOS	wiking: can I just remove one of them?
 c4goldsw	So, I understand that in order to create an eigen map you'd use typename SGMatrix<ST>::EigenMatrixXtMap eMap(feature_matrix) (according to this (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMapClass.html) at least) , but typename SGMatrix<ST>::EigenMatrixXtMap eMap = feature_matrix; seems to work.
@wiking	OXPHOS: move? what do  you mean move?
@wiking	OXPHOS: either make it that it uses gcc5 for compilation
@wiking	or that you use another ranlib
@wiking	but this is just because the env is !@#$
@wiking	so i cannot help more
@wiking	brew uninstall gcc5
@wiking	or something should definitely solve it
 OXPHOS	wiking: okay lemme try. thx!
