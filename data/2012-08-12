 wiking	oh cool thanx heiko
 wiking	n4nd0: here?
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah
 n4nd0	tell me
 wiking	n4nd0: i'm just about to send in the CData stuff we've agreed on
 wiking	i'll send u the link just to say whether it's ok
 wiking	so we can use it in structured* as well
 n4nd0	ok

 wiking	anybody had this error before: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u201c' in position 426236: ordinal not in range(128)
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	I think it looks pretty similar to an error that drove Soeren mad some time ago
 n4nd0	it was something related to a very weird character that Heiko introduced not in purpose
 wiking	lol
 wiking	btw: i cannot use latex symbols in doxygen?
 wiking	like \hat ?
 wiking	should that be rather mathml?
 n4nd0	are you using the latex syntax for doxygen?
 n4nd0	something like f[ or so
 n4nd0	don't really remember by heart
 wiking	aaah ok i see
 n4nd0	wiking: check for example how it is done here
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/classifier/LDA.h
 n4nd0	you have both examples there
 n4nd0	to do equations on separate lines with \f[ .... \f]
 n4nd0	adn on the same line with \f$...\f$
 wiking	yep i'm just testing it :)
 wiking	but still i have to find out what's with that codec problem :D
 n4nd0	mmm I am not sure if it is the same that happened that time I told you about
 n4nd0	let me search in the logs a bit
 n4nd0	maybe I can find something
 n4nd0	don't find it :S
 wiking	mmm no worries
 wiking	i'm trying now again with some changes... let's see if that solves it
 wiking	heheh no help :)
 n4nd0	have you found out wich character is it?
 n4nd0	try to make your editor show you non printable characters too, it may help
 wiking	yeah i'm just checking the xml
 wiking	 <compound refid="dir_41918c6c0cd8700fe74209d6eeba587a" kind="dir"><name>/Users/wiking/shogun/src/shogun/lib/malsar/</name>
 wiking	  </compound>
 wiking	that's the line :)))
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	what are you using that for?
 wiking	meeee?
 wiking	nothing
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	it's generated by something in that index.ml
 wiking	index.xml
 wiking	ok i'm not sure if that's true... actually
 wiking	since i thought it's a line
 wiking	but rather a position...
 wiking	damn how can i search a char position ? :)
 n4nd0	eeeh
 n4nd0	looks like a philosophical question :D

 wiking	blackburn: here?
 blackburn	wiking: yeah
 blackburn	what's up?
 wiking	blackburn: i'm having some character encoding problem in the generated index.xml
 wiking	when creating the doxygen file... any ideas?
 wiking	UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u201c' in position 426236: ordinal not in range(128)
 wiking	something like this
 blackburn	well heiko tends to add such great characters :D
 blackburn	actually no idea how sonney2k managed to solve that twice
 wiking	mmm was it coming from the doxygen description part?
 blackburn	yes I think so
 wiking	blackburn: do u know any tool to find out which char is a given position in the file?
 blackburn	hmm not really
 blackburn	may be some snippet could do that

 wiking	lol i've found the char
 wiking	ok i guess one should never ever copy past a paper reference from a pdf into doxygen comment... otherwise you'll end up with bad char encoding

 blackburn	hey puffin444
 blackburn	I noticed there are a few memory leaks in gps
 puffin444	yes
 puffin444	The problem lies with CMap
 blackburn	aahh
 puffin444	I posted a reproduction of the bug on the mailing list a week or so ago
 blackburn	puffin444: hmm I just valgrinded
 blackburn	gaussian_processes_ard
 puffin444	yes?
 blackburn	there are a few sgvector leaks
 puffin444	Yes. CMap does something weird when its CMap<SGVector, TParameter*>
 blackburn	okay got it
 puffin444	I've been corresponding with gsomix about it and he hasn't figured it out yet.
 blackburn	puffin444: okay I will take a look
 puffin444	okay. Sorry if I have been AWOL a bit this week.
 blackburn	puffin444: I am not worried about it ;)
 blackburn	you did quite a lot things this summer
 blackburn	puffin444: is it worth to use gaussian process regressor as classifier?
 puffin444	I am not sure. There may be a few things I need to do to get it ready for classification.
 puffin444	I know it is possible - the GPML has code to do it.
 blackburn	I see

 wiking	blackburn: it was in the doxygen part that i've written...
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	it was some weird quotation mark coming from a pdf file
 wiking	ok i'm back to finish the doxygen for the code
 wiking	pr is about to land \o/
 blackburn	that's cool

 wiking	blackburn: have u seen that awesome unittest? :D
 blackburn	wiking: no, I missed it actually
 blackburn	what is so awesome in it? :)
 blackburn	wiking: checked ocas test - so you require to linearly separate data
 wiking	heheh that it actually works smoothly :)
 blackburn	wiking: do you remember what was wrong with google mock under ubuntu?
