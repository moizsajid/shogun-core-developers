@wiking	sonney2k: if u could share the sh.cpp itself that would be great
@wiking	Saurabh7: ^
@wiking	Saurabh7: basically it seems you are trying to call some methods in a wrong way
 Saurabh7	wiking, its the example from docs
 Saurabh7	http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/developer_tutorial.html
@wiking	Saurabh7: which one?
 Saurabh7	gaussian kernel one
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053041218.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@wiking	Saurabh7: mmm hardly as there is no line where it tries to call
@wiking	set_feature_matrix(float64_t*&, int, int)'
@wiking	set_feature_matrix(float64_t*&, int, int)
 Saurabh7	wiking, sorry it is the gaussian kernel one from here:https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/README_developer.md

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add githalytics to README.md
@wiking	Saurabh7: certainly that needs to be fixed :D
@iglesiasg	sup guys
@wiking	iglesiasg: our README_developer.md is outdated :D
 Saurabh7	wiking, so the argument should be a matrix only?
@iglesiasg	wiking,  let me see
@wiking	yes
@iglesiasg	wiking, what did you spot?

@wiking	iglesiasg: ^ check the diff
@wiking	Saurabh7: this should b good
@iglesiasg	wiking, wow there were even float64_t* instead of sg_matrix
@wiking	yep
@wiking	:)
 Saurabh7	wiking, this is weird, i am still getting errors http://pastebin.com/9zH3QehP

 Saurabh7	wiking, g++ -lshogun sh2.cpp -o a
@wiking	Saurabh7 mm i really wonder if this is compiling this far
@wiking	did u do a make install of shogun?
@wiking	where's your libshogun.so and the headers
@wiking	?
@wiking	you should have something lie
@wiking	*like
@wiking	g++ sh2.cpp -o a -L/usr/local/lib -lshogun
@wiking	buut
@wiking	maybe they are in your path
@wiking	sooo
@wiking	then just
@wiking	change the order
@wiking	g++ sh2.cpp -o -lshogun
@wiking	g++ sh2.cpp -o a -lshogun
@wiking	as g++ in this sense order sensitive
 Saurabh7	wiking, i did do a make install
 Saurabh7	let me try
 Saurabh7	wiking, you are right
 Saurabh7	works!
 Saurabh7	thanks
