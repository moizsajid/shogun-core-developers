@lambday	HeikoS2: got a bit sick.. better now.. good otherwise.. :)
 HeikoS2	lambday: oh no!
@lambday	HeikoS2: how are you?
 HeikoS2	yeah there was some flu around when I left
 HeikoS2	lambday: yeah good
 HeikoS2	so nice here
 HeikoS2	google tinos greek island
 HeikoS2	very good conference
 HeikoS2	just gave a talk
@lambday	HeikoS2: hehe the place seems great!
@lambday	what was the talk about?
 HeikoS2	kernel hmc
 HeikoS2	lambday: in the train I was curious about the xvalidation
 HeikoS2	didnt see the answer since my connection dropped
@lambday	HeikoS2: yeah right now working on just that..
 HeikoS2	ah I see
 HeikoS2	already a hunch of how much faster it will be?
@lambday	HeikoS2: refactored mmd related internals quite a bit
@lambday	HeikoS2: should be faster now.. not exactly sure how much.. will run some experiments tonight
 HeikoS2	ok cool
 HeikoS2	bzdmgz: what about sanujs patches?
 bzdmgz	HeikoS2: it doesn't work with R yet
 HeikoS2	lambday: very curious, can you send me an email once done?
 bzdmgz	but we need some patch in swig
 HeikoS2	bzdmgz: can I push things in some way?
 HeikoS2	or help
 bzdmgz	I'd suggest to move forward
 bzdmgz	without R
 bzdmgz	for now
 HeikoS2	lambday: and the new API, can you put that into the meta examples?
 HeikoS2	lambday: we want the unit tests to be green soon
 HeikoS2	lambday: also, any news on the experiments on kernel selection?=
@lambday	HeikoS2: yeah I will do that..
 HeikoS2	thanks!
 HeikoS2	bzdmgz: okok
@lambday	HeikoS2: will run the experiments with the changes I'm making now.. last few days focused a bit on the cleanups
 HeikoS2	lambday: cool!
 HeikoS2	let me know how it goes
@lambday	yeah

 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: hi
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: how are things?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS2: hey! everything's good! I was away for the weekend
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: for holiday?
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: hope it was nice! :)
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: I have two questions:
 HeikoS2	1.) can we do this "define for all p types" thing?
 HeikoS2	2.) any news on cereal?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS2: no special holidays..just visiting friends. it was HOT.
 HeikoS2	wiking: can you help with cereal?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS2: 1). I think so I'll try 2). not much..was still focusing on the linalg stuff
 OXPHOS	HeikoS2: but plan to start this week
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: so for linalg, send a patch every now and then, like cookbook
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: dont focus on it anymore
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: just continuous progress needed, not major work anymore
 OXPHOS	HeikoS2: okay
 HeikoS2	OXPHOS: cereal needs a prototype and a concept asap, we need to discuss with bzdmgz and wiking
 HeikoS2	bzdmgz: can you help with cereal?
 bzdmgz	probably
 OXPHOS	bzdmgz: thx!
