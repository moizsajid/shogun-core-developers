 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rf4dcb8a / .gitignore : ignore Converter.i - http://git.io/6H18Tw
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r7644ddc / (src/shogun/io/File.cpp src/shogun/io/File.h): add function to read whole file into buffer - http://git.io/lbW7vg
 blackburn	sonney2k: what did you implement?
 blackburn	a lot of changes, can't catch idea
@sonney2k	serialization support for swig -builtin
 blackburn	python only?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see. why did you focused on it?
@sonney2k	I don't understand
@sonney2k	we need serialization support
 blackburn	wasn't it working before?
@sonney2k	so I needed to fix this for the new -builtin
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	no = wasn't?
@sonney2k	we had it in the old code w/o -builtin
@sonney2k	but that was python
 blackburn	what is the difference?
@sonney2k	converting to -builtin made it no longer work
@sonney2k	so I fixed that
 blackburn	oh okay
@sonney2k	still no buffer protocol support though... too tough...
@sonney2k	have to leave the train now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	train? now?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	Re
 blackburn	sonney2k: strange time to be in train :)
@sonney2k	just came back from granada...
 blackburn	hmm thought you came on friday
 blackburn	sonney2k: can GMNP SVM be considered as state of art still?
@sonney2k	in which respect?
@sonney2k	it is just a multiclass svm...
 blackburn	I understand, but I wonder if there is any better formulation (in any means)
@sonney2k	one-vs-rest :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: one-vs-rest is worse on my dataset in means of accuracy
 blackburn	and performance is awful
 blackburn	how can you treat it as better?
@sonney2k	usually a lot faster and same perf
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm 903 svms are not so fast :)
@sonney2k	YMMV
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	I haz no opulence :(
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you any experience of random forests?
 blackburn	I would implement it for shogun some day I guess
 blackburn	btw we already haZZ tasks for at least 3 gsoc students
@sonney2k	no never did that
@sonney2k	I have to sleep now...
@sonney2k	but yes - lots of nice things :)
@sonney2k	btw you should not call your toolbox largescale
@sonney2k	people associate with largescale petabytes of data
 blackburn	sonney2k: middlescale?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	so maybe just Dimension Reduction Toolbox and mention that it is fast
 blackburn	sonney2k: at least our thing doesn't crash on 40000d datasets
 blackburn	hmm okay
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do you think can it be called just
@sonney2k	but it will crash on 400000 examples already
 blackburn	ah nevermind
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is not possible to embed 400000 vectors theoretically :)
@sonney2k	it is :)
@sonney2k	anyway bed time!
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	sonney2k: see you
 blackburn	btw shogun failed to compile on my machine
 blackburn	but I need to sleep as well
 blackburn	/home/blackburn/shogun/shogun/src/shogun/regression/svr/LibSVR.cpp:109: undefined reference to `shogun::CKernelMachine::create_new_model(int)'
 blackburn	/home/blackburn/shogun/shogun/src/shogun/regression/svr/LibSVR.cpp:109: undefined reference to `shogun::CKernelMachine::create_new_model(int)'
 blackburn	/home/blackburn/shogun/shogun/src/shogun/regression/svr/LibSVR.cpp:109: undefined reference to `shogun::CKernelMachine::create_new_model(int)'
 blackburn	I said it is not possible cause it is not possible to solve 400000x400000 eigenproblem :)
 blackburn	especially dense
 blackburn	on typical machine

 ishaanmlhtr	and i think even  you used the same
 blackburn1	strange..
 ishaanmlhtr	why did you use '>L' in your unpack format?
 blackburn1	ishaanmlhtr: it is a format of that file, I guess it is 64/32 issue
