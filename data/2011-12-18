@sonney2k	blackburn, what is a data set downloader?
 blackburn	sonney2k: we can't include say mnist
 blackburn	but can add some downloader
 blackburn	scikits did it
@sonney2k	blackburn, I see - maybe we should upload all our datasets to mloss.org and then just grab it from there
@sonney2k	that would have the advantage that we can easily read it from python
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes something like that
 blackburn	sonney2k: why don't you sleeping? :)
@sonney2k	I could ask you the same thing...
@sonney2k	I am doing the new builtin serialization
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah, I was arguing about google new face detection technology
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you take a look on my paper?
@sonney2k	send it to me
@sonney2k	now...
 blackburn	sending
@sonney2k	tomorrow I have a bit of time
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok thanks in advance
 blackburn	it is 5 page so should not take a long ;)
 blackburn	3 in fact, references and pics takes 2

 blackburn	sonney2k: good night
@sonney2k	sleep well :)
@sonney2k	well 4 pages is the limit
@sonney2k	+1 page citations
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it a hard limit?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can it be done?..
 blackburn	stop
@sonney2k	shogun had only 3 pages
 blackburn	4+1?
@sonney2k	+1 ref
@sonney2k	so be happy that you have one more page
 blackburn	sonney2k: will 4+1 work?
 blackburn	I mean is it strict 4 including refs?
@sonney2k	4 strict for content
@sonney2k	+1 page refs
 blackburn	I'm worried how to cut it in case of it is too large :)
@sonney2k	usually no problem
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay thanks
 blackburn	sleep well too, see yuo
@sonney2k	cu

 ishaanmlhtr	Ram108:are you done with classifying the dataset that blackburn gave using kNN?
 Ram108	nope sorry i had exams last week just got free now........... i ll be starting again today
 Ram108	are u done with it ishaan?
 ishaanmlhtr	no, i am stuck up.getting a shogun exception again again when i apply the trained classifier to my test set.
 ishaanmlhtr	any suggestions on how to go about it?
 Ram108	no sorry i havent reached there yet....... i have just finished the train phase...... am gona work on that one now
 ishaanmlhtr	ok..tell me if you are done with it.also,any idea why the parameter_list got 2 sets of arguments?
 ishaanmlhtr	i am talking about the kNN classifier file.
 ishaanmlhtr	in python_modular examples
 ishaanmlhtr	have you gone through it?
 Ram108	parameter_list = [[traindat,testdat,label_traindat,3].....?
 ishaanmlhtr	ya
 ishaanmlhtr	if i remove the 2nd argument,then also it works,no?
 Ram108	apparantly both are the same....... no idea...... i ll try figuring that out tweaking parameters here and there
 ishaanmlhtr	alright.

 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: I sent ;)
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : ya, got it..thanks :)
 Ram108	hi blackburn
 blackburn	Ram108: hi
 Ram108	sorry had exams last weekcouldnt catch up
 Ram108	i ll start on it soon :)
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : could you tell me some simplest application that i could try implementing along with implementing the other classifiers?
 ishaanmlhtr	*simple
 blackburn	Ram108: no problem, feel free to do anything :)
 Ram108	:)
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: ehm do you want to implement some classifier?
 ishaanmlhtr	ya.
 blackburn	which one?
 ishaanmlhtr	gaussian bayes?
 blackburn	already here
 blackburn	naive?
 ishaanmlhtr	ya
 blackburn	if yes then already here
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: I can suggest you some application with python
 ishaanmlhtr	ya,fine..
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: there is a MNIST dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 ishaanmlhtr	ok.
 ishaanmlhtr	i should go through it first?
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: it would be nice to have an application which runs on this dataset
 blackburn	and compares different methods
 ishaanmlhtr	hmm..alright.
 blackburn	if you want to implement some classifier or so I can suggest you something too
 blackburn	it is up to you
 ishaanmlhtr	i think i'll have a read first. in any case, i am trying out the different classifiers that are already there in shogun on the flowers dataset
 blackburn	yeah good practice
 blackburn	but iris dataset is small
 blackburn	while MNIST is huuuuuge
 ishaanmlhtr	ok,then that's better - i can try the classifiers now on MNIST
 ishaanmlhtr	and compare the results even more accurately.
 ishaanmlhtr	:)
 ishaanmlhtr	i'll have a read and get back to you in case i am stuck up.
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: I can send you a snipped I've used to read this data format
 blackburn	snippet*
 ishaanmlhtr	ya,sure any help would be good.:)
 ishaanmlhtr	please mail me.thanks.:)
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: sent. you have to put data in mnist/ folder right with that script to run
 ishaanmlhtr	ok
