 sonne|work	besser82: at least the osx buildbot fails now with python
 sonne|work	so it is not using libstdc++
 sonne|work	but the wrong libc++
 besser82	sonne|work:  lemme check...
 besser82	sonne|work:  so then the error comes from the previous design of CMakeLists...
 besser82	sonne|work:  gimme ~ 30 mins, I'll fix that...

 shogun-buildbot	build #2611 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2611
@sonney2k	besser82, seems to be ok what you did but it is just not working - no way to mix libc++ and libstdc++
@sonney2k	osx is just a b0rken mess
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, around?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yep
 besser82	sonney2k:  so for OSX we need to the libc++-aware iSWIGZZZ  :(
 besser82	sonney2k:  no iShogun, without that  :(
@iglesiasg	iShogun haha
 shogun-buildbot	build #12 of osx2 - python is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20python/builds/12
@sonney2k	besser82, well that or no mixture of protobuf and python_modular
 besser82	sonney2k:  or that  :(  doesn't protobuf support libc++ss
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I have a weird issue
@sonney2k	sonney2k, protobuf does
@sonney2k	besser82, ^
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what is it?
@sonney2k	besser82, but not siwg
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I tried generating data for the bmrm example
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, the problem is - something is fishy / weird
 besser82	sonney2k:  so why protobuf XOR python_modular on OSX???
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I serialize multiclass so labels once
@sonney2k	besser82, protbuf requires libc++, swig doesn't work with libc++ -> kaboom
@sonney2k	besser82, I checked the changelog of swig - swig 3.0 will have a fix
 besser82	sonney2k:  iC  ok, that is a reason, then  ;)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, mmm so what happened when you tried generating data? What about the serialization? Didn't work out well?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but then when I load it back - it is jsut sturcturelabels
@iglesiasg	aham!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so of course a couple of properties are missing -> fail
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, might be that gsomix' conversion hack doesn't work
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so now way of going back to multiclass so labels after load?
@iglesiasg	now should be no...
@iglesiasg	in serialization only the StructuredLabels attributes are stored, no MulticlassSOLabels, I understand
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so maybe I forcefully convert it to multiclass before serializing OR I don't store multiclassl labels
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, apart from that we have a minor numerical issue in histogram* kernel
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so a regenereate will fix this
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and some deviation in kmeans
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just a little sth like 0.81 vs 0.83 in cluster accuracy
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and finally 4 tests of heikos code fail (KMM and MMD)
@sonney2k	I have no idea how to fix heikos ...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, did you tell him about it?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what about the kmeans change? Did you detect in what commit it started?
@iglesiasg	I can open an issue to  let Heiko know otherwise
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, please open an issue then... but we need to *urgently* get things to green
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, suggestions what we could do?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw you could check whether heikos stuff *ever* worked fine
@sonney2k	it might be that it never did
@sonney2k	massive deviations...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I was thinking about checking kmeans, but I can switch to that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just a hint how to do that w/o compiing:
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, open up http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2138
@sonney2k	then search the name of some failing mmd test
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but is there a way to query several builds easily?
@sonney2k	and then put in the url some older number
@iglesiasg	to find out when the fail started
@sonney2k	say 2000 instead of 2138
@iglesiasg	all right exactly that way hehe
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well wget the log ...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so they worked fine in the past
 besser82	sonney2k:  I'll do the needed changes to CMakeLists during tomorrow && PR, like making protobuf XOR py_mod if SWIG_VER < 3.0
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, here it is: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2130
@iglesiasg	they started to fail with this build
@iglesiasg	fuck.. it is just a cmake change
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, do you find a reason for that btw?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, 2129 is build successful, 2130 breaks and the change is just in cmake
@iglesiasg	what am I missing here?
 besser82	iglesiasg:  nothing
@iglesiasg	besser82, explain me then please ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, the cmake change broke it??!
 besser82	iglesiasg:  nope  ;)  The fails were there before, but....
@iglesiasg	aham
@iglesiasg	I am reading the cmake change actually...
 shogun-buildbot	build #13 of osx2 - python is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20python/builds/13  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@iglesiasg	besser82, but hold on
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, what do you mean?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, the cmake change did only make it turn red
@sonney2k	not break it
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, look for the output of the mmd thing - it should complain before
 besser82	iglesiasg:  noone noticed, because the test-exec was wrapped in a call to cmake and that simply return errorlevel 0, even if the test was exit(1)
@iglesiasg	I see
@iglesiasg	back to binary search then.... :)
 besser82	iglesiasg:  my change just made the wrapped-cmake return errorlevel 1, too, if the test does....
@iglesiasg	besser82, got it
@iglesiasg	I saw the cmake change makes more output being printed
@iglesiasg	but I didn't see what you just explained about the errorlevel
 besser82	iglesiasg:  allrighty, then  :D

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well just check what the mmd example said
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yeah, I am actually looing for the output of the test now
@iglesiasg	not just the build colour, as I did before
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: I suppose the tests fail because of differences in Pickle and really "computed" data....
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: How long those pickles haven't been touched?
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: and how much changes in code have been made since then?
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: as i can see most of those pickles are olden then 9 months!?!?
@iglesiasg	besser82, yep
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: and I bet they are failing because sth in code changed, which changes the computed output
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: so pickled data != computed
@iglesiasg	besser82, yes, that's how these integration tests word, exactly
 besser82	sonney2k, iglesiasg: althogh the computed data is correct, but the pickle hasn't been updated...
@iglesiasg	besser82, it can be that the data is correct or not
@iglesiasg	a bug could be introduced
@iglesiasg	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2061
@iglesiasg	this one is fishy ^
@iglesiasg	the integration test for statistics_linear_time_mmd is fine and the normal example breaks
@iglesiasg	I am guessing that when the example breaks the integration tester says it passed?
@iglesiasg	this makes no sense to me...
@iglesiasg	the integration tests are fine in 2069
@iglesiasg	and they break in 2070, where the commit is just an indent fix
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I have absolutely no clue wtf we have no MulticlassSOLabels when serializing
@iglesiasg	and I have no clue about x-files in the buildbot
@sonney2k	sonney2k, so which git commits are 2069 / 2070
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ^
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, do a diff!
@sonney2k	besser82, usually these are real bugs
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but hold on
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, the commit that appears in 2070
@iglesiasg	isn't the only one between 2069 and 2070?
@iglesiasg	checking that....
 besser82	sonney2k:  allright, allright;  I just wanted to blame the pickles  :-P
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could be...
@sonney2k	besser82, no no
 besser82	sonney2k:  ???
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think the structured labels stuff is sth with include order
@sonney2k	besser82, not pickle
 besser82	sonney2k:  I got it  ;)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it is possible, I never take into account include order unfortunately
@iglesiasg	don't know the rules at all
@iglesiasg	whether they apply etc
* besser82 off for tonight ---> Zzzzzz...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, when you've got a second, have a look please
@iglesiasg	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2069
@iglesiasg	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2070
@iglesiasg	69 is fine
@iglesiasg	in 70 the integration tests are not
@iglesiasg	and the revision is the same!!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ?!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, so it might be that we just upgraded some numerical libs
@iglesiasg	to me it is suspicious
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah doesn't really make sense
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, could you pplease check when kmeans broke?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, actually evaluation_clustering_simple.py
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, actually same thing with that!
@sonney2k	ok in 2069 - bad in 2070
@iglesiasg	it is really weird...
@sonney2k	it is indeed
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, you could try to run that old version and check if it really fails (or even a slightly older one)
@iglesiasg	all right, let me do that
@iglesiasg	if I go to say, the revision that in the buildbot is 2060
@iglesiasg	and it fails, then it is about a lib update or so
