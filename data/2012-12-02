@sonney2k	wiking, hey there
@sonney2k	I am still tracing that united memory related issue causing the crashes in serialization
@sonney2k	I think it is due to a bug when serializing dynamicobjectarray - the whole array (incl. some reserve/cache buffer) is serialized not just what is necessary
 blackburn	wiking: I didn't know it is possible to use directors with java :D
 wiking	blackburn: well i just had some default flags in
 wiking	and that's what happened
 blackburn	so you mean you had directors enabled but compiled java?
 wiking	no i had java and python modular
 wiking	and directors
 blackburn	got it
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah we never tried java & directors
