 gsomix	aha, workin on surface triangulation now
@sonney2k	gsomix, booring
@sonney2k	gsomix, looking forward to your PR this evening
@sonney2k	heiko, can you have a look at puffins PR?
@sonney2k	heiko, ahh and one question - do we have serialization support for SGSparseMatrix ?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes I will soon
@sonney2k	heiko, thanks
 heiko	sonney2k, I think no
@sonney2k	heiko, and for SGStringList?
 heiko	sonney2, I also just talked to this guy who found that x-val for multiclass machines doesnt work
 heiko	sonney2k, not that I know of, I never touched it
@sonney2k	ok - so it is probably still the same code that we had with double* stuff right?
 heiko	sorry, didnt get that
 heiko	what do you mean now?
@sonney2k	heiko, before we had SGVector / SGMatrix
@sonney2k	we had double* int
 heiko	ah I see
 heiko	yes
 heiko	same code
@sonney2k	k
 heiko	actually, these vectors only register the array
 heiko	the rest (the SGVector structure) stays with the class
 heiko	so same thing as before SGVector for serialization
@sonney2k	so I guess the fix would be to do the same thing for SGSparseMatrix
@sonney2k	heiko, ohh one thing - what happens to the reference count of SGVector?
 heiko	so far, nothing, its on my todo list :)
 heiko	should just be svaed
 heiko	saved
@sonney2k	that sounds like a crasher
@sonney2k	yeah
 heiko	I think that should do it
@sonney2k	k
@sonney2k	heiko, I am asking because I am working on converting sparsefeatures -> SGSparseMatrix
 heiko	I see
 heiko	maybe this can be serialized
 heiko	I just never used
 heiko	was it possible before?
@sonney2k	I *think* so :D
 heiko	hehe :D
@sonney2k	heiko, ok thanks sorry for the interruption
 heiko	sonney2k, no worries
 heiko	sonney2k, btw as I already said
 heiko	there is this guy who found out that x-val doesnt work for anything but libsvm
 heiko	is anybody aware of that?
 heiko	I wasnt
@sonney2k	I never tried...
@sonney2k	heiko, ohh btw did you ask wrt. shogun toolbox foundation stuff?
@sonney2k	otherwise we might loose quite a bit of money.
 heiko	oh, yes, I forgot that
 heiko	I talked to a guy who does that for a plane-friend-organization
 heiko	He told me the following:
 heiko	its possible, however
 heiko	its much work (we would have to do reports a few times a year, 4 or so)
 heiko	the leaders are repsonsible for finanzial stuff and also liable in case of a crash or so
 heiko	they had this example where they bought some ground to do stuff and the leaders took the wrong decision and then a few hundred thousand euros were gone
 heiko	but thats probably not the case for us as we dont deal with any "risk"
@sonney2k	no money no risk :D
 heiko	except for ML risks ;)
@sonney2k	heh
 heiko	yeah, I mean its quite some formal organizational stuff that we would have to do. Everybody would have to get together to vote about the Satzung etc.
 heiko	and the guy told me that usually these Amt people are not well aware of internet based stuff
 heiko	but that might have changed
@sonney2k	heiko, if you can easily find out what we have to do then please do otherwise it is what it is
@sonney2k	heiko, well I would just do it via internet
@sonney2k	I don't see any other possible way
 heiko	yeah, that was more of a general discussion about it with that friend
 heiko	yes Internet is the way.
 heiko	I will try to call somebody this week and ask more questions, kind of forgot about that in the last weeks
 heiko	when is your tax thing due?
@sonney2k	heiko, btw blackburn is digging into the modsel stuff so he might know more what works ok what not :)
 heiko	sonney2k, good to hear
@sonney2k	heiko, I don't know - I am usually slow with this stuff
@sonney2k	heiko, and I actually would like gsomix to start with the new modsel typemaps rather soon (next week latest) so we should find out too :)
 shogun-buildbot	build #151 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/151
 heiko	yes, I will investigate this multiclass problem later today
 blackburn	multiclass is not modsel issue
 blackburn	it is just multiple train call issue
@sonney2k	heiko, you heard the master :D
 heiko	blackburn, yes, did you already check that out?
 heiko	sonney2k, I am feeling spied now :D
 blackburn	well what I know larank fails to work with modsel
 blackburn	not because of modsel
 heiko	blackburn, GMNPSVM fails with cross-validation evaluation already
 blackburn	I am pretty sure the same reason
 heiko	ok
 heiko	what exactly is the reason? multiple training? whats that? shouldnt be bad
 blackburn	heiko: train() train() yeah
 heiko	why is that bad?
 heiko	should be slow but not give false results?
 blackburn	larank doesn't clean up some stuff
 heiko	a ok
 blackburn	so kaboooms
 blackburn	heiko: did you like my modseloutput stuff?
 heiko	blackburn, where?
 heiko	the debug messages?
 blackburn	not really - I added a class
 heiko	havent seen yet
 heiko	what does it do?
 blackburn	modelselection/ModelSelectionOutput.h
 blackburn	well just outputs test/train indices/results, evaluation result
 heiko	ah cool
 heiko	yes I will probably like it
 blackburn	ah and for linear machine it outputs W
 blackburn	next step would be to set up different output ways
 blackburn	now it just prints
 heiko	cool
 heiko	good idea
 blackburn	heiko: have you seen some eigen3 code is in?
 heiko	I noticed it
 heiko	whats it for?
 blackburn	I bet you would like it
 blackburn	well blas without 75878 parameters :)
 blackburn	and faster
 heiko	ah
 heiko	nice :)
 heiko	thats something I like :)
 blackburn	heiko: trace(A*B') is (A*B.transpose()).trace()
 heiko	ehm? yes?
 heiko	so thats how you use it or what?
 heiko	our SGMatrices got these operators now?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	heiko: well that wouldn't work with sgmatrices anyway
 heiko	what was that then?
 blackburn	heiko: they have MatrixXd for that
 heiko	ah ok
 blackburn	however
 blackburn	if you want to use some preallocated memory
 blackburn	you may use Map<MatrixXd> stuff
 blackburn	this way you can modify sgmatrix's data
 heiko	I am a bit lost now
 heiko	what can one do nwo?
 heiko	now
 blackburn	heiko: well you may use eigen3 both for sgmatrices and some internal MatrixXd matrices
 heiko	ah now I see
 blackburn	heiko: http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\min_\beta%20\frac{1}{2}%20\beta^T%20K%20\beta%20-%20\kappa%20\beta%20\\%20\beta_i%20\in%20[0,B],%20~~~%20\left|\sum_i%20\beta_i%20-%20n_s\right|%20\leqslant%20n_s%20\varepsilon
 blackburn	any idea how to approach this problem?
 blackburn	uricamic: may be you? :)
 heiko	blackburn, I cannot read that
 blackburn	heiko: everything except beta is given
 heiko	no the font
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	again? :D
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	black on black
 blackburn	ok will try different latex generator
 blackburn	heiko: how about that? http://www.numberempire.com/equation.render?\min_\beta%20\frac{1}{2}%20\beta^T%20K%20\beta%20-%20\kappa%20\beta\\\beta_i%20\in%20[0,B],%20~~~%20\left|\sum_i%20\beta_i%20-%20n_s\right|%20\leqslant%20n_s%20\varepsilon
 heiko	same thing
 heiko	ust send the tex
 heiko	Ill insert it myself
 heiko	ah i have it
 blackburn	heiko: \min_\beta \frac{1}{2} \beta^T K \beta - \kappa \beta
 blackburn	\\
 blackburn	\beta_i \in [0,B], ~~~ \left|\sum_i \beta_i - n_s\right| \leqslant n_s \varepsilon
 heiko	without this abs value thing it would be easy right?
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	this looks a bit like a L1 norm regularizer, isnt there a lasso method that does a similar thing?
 heiko	blackburn, otherwise. no idea, never saw one like this :)
 blackburn	heiko: I don't know actually..
 blackburn	it is a KMM
 blackburn	kernel mean matching
 heiko	mmh
 blackburn	some stuff by your supervisor btw :)
 heiko	really?
 heiko	we compute the distance between the means
 heiko	we dont match them :)
 blackburn	http://listengine.tuxfamily.org/lists.tuxfamily.org/eigen/2012/07/msg00101.html
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	heiko: http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/shift-book-for-LeEtAl-webversion_5376%5b0%5d.pdf
 heiko	oh well
 heiko	at least not me :)

@sonney2k	gsomix, adn ta-dam?
 gsomix	for success
@sonney2k	heh
 gsomix	ok, need some defines.
 gsomix	and PR.
 heiko	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	I wanted to ask about that multiple train() bug again
 blackburn	aham
 heiko	we need to train multiple times while cv
 blackburn	exactly
 heiko	so how did you resolve the other one?
 blackburn	I didn't
 blackburn	it is not fixed yet
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	I will check whether its really the resion
 heiko	reason
 blackburn	heiko: just add double train call in
 blackburn	classifier_larank_modular
 heiko	blackburn, just did :)
 blackburn	gmnp works though
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	yes
 heiko	but I train on same features
 heiko	Ill train on different and then on original again
 heiko	no its fine
 heiko	so thats not the problem for gmnp
 heiko	blackburn, any other suspicions?
 blackburn	heiko: no, not really
 blackburn	we need to check what fails
 blackburn	and what works
-!- KMcQuisten [d8338942@gateway/web/freenode/ip.216.51.137.66] has joined #shogun
 KMcQuisten	Hello all
 blackburn	it's been a long, KMcQuisten
 blackburn	how are you?
 blackburn	heiko: I will take care of larank
 KMcQuisten	I'm doing ok, but I'm having some troubles.  Can't even get a simple 2kernel MKL to train.
 heiko	blackburn, ok, wait a bit
 heiko	perhaps the fault is in the CV
 blackburn	do you think so?
 heiko	blackburn, you mean me?
 blackburn	heiko: what is wrong in CV?
 heiko	if so: I think the recent multiclass-change might have caused problems
 heiko	I remember fixing something when I did my multi-class bioinfo coursework on christmas
 blackburn	hmm
 heiko	but I only did this for libsvm
 heiko	remember?
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: what is the problem?
 heiko	labels were not set correctly to all submachine or something
 KMcQuisten	blackburn:  Same kind of thing as before.  Using multiple string kenrels in MKLregression, setup up the proper features and kernels, then when I train, sometimes it will train, and sometimes I get:
 KMcQuisten	SystemError: [ERROR] Assertion R >= 0 failed!
 KMcQuisten	And it seems random
 KMcQuisten	i think we dealt with this once before, but it's become unfixed, as it were
 KMcQuisten	I have a test script I can email you if you want to reproduce
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: sure
 KMcQuisten	Sent
 KMcQuisten	Did that make it through to you?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: yeah fails here too
 blackburn	checking code
 KMcQuisten	Righto
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: for now you may disable linadd again
 KMcQuisten	Ah, yes
 blackburn	slower but seems to work
 KMcQuisten	Sounds like a plan for now

 blackburn	I ask everyone today :D
 wiking	boooyaaa
 blackburn	awakening of wiking
 wiking	heheh yeps
 os253	I have compared to this at some point: it's very simple and works ok.
 os253	http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.165.8929
 wiking	blackburn: new pr
 wiking	!
 wiking	so take it
 wiking	oh no just a sec to pull it
 wiking	blackburn: btw have u had time to check on larank and cv?
 blackburn	os253: I'd like to implement it but stucked with formulation
 blackburn	os253: can you help me there?
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko is the expert for that isn't he?
 wiking	blackburn: and do you have a hog implementation at hand?
 blackburn	wiking: I have python hog implementation only actually
 wiking	blackburn: what are the dependencies?
 wiking	apart from python ;)
 os253	blackburn: with the exact identical method?
 os253	I.e. you need an implementation of this?
 blackburn	os253: well I am confused with |\sum \beta_i - n_tr | < e n_tr
 wiking	sonney2k: i think u could run libshogun test on freebsd bot
 blackburn	os253: how one can handle this?
 blackburn	wiking: I didn't get to larank yet
 wiking	sonney2k: i've installed some extra dependencies on that machine for shogun
 wiking	blackburn: link for hog?
 blackburn	wiking: I'll send you a link in a sec
 wiking	blackburn: cool thnx
 blackburn	wiking: I used this one http://code.google.com/p/python-cvgreyc/source/browse/trunk/cvgreyc/features/HOG.py?r=83
 os253	To be honest I looked at this years ago and compared to it only. The implementation was from elephant (an ML toolbox), I think. Maybe I also coded it up, I can take a look.
 blackburn	os253: formulation is
 blackburn	http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\min_\beta%20\frac{1}{2}%20\beta^T%20K%20\beta%20-%20\kappa%20\beta%20\\%20\beta_i%20\in%20[0,B],%20~~~%20\left|\sum_i%20\beta_i%20-%20n_s\right|%20\leqslant%20n_s%20\varepsilon
 wiking	blackburn: thnx i'll give it a go
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be you can help too?
 blackburn	:)
 os253	get's scrambled in this IRC client. Give me a bit, need to finish 1,2 things and then will take a look.
 blackburn	ok sure

 yoo	good evening there
 blackburn	evening
@sonney2k	gsomix, I don't get it
 heiko	yoo, still looking at the problem
@sonney2k	gsomix, are these operators for += ?
 heiko	quick fix didnt work ;)
@sonney2k	etc
 yoo	heiko: brb
 gsomix	sonney2k, +=, *=, -=. more operators are needed?
@sonney2k	gsomix, but isn't this doing x+=y where x are CDenseFeatures and y is a numpy matrix?
@sonney2k	gsomix, why don't you write instead of
@sonney2k	result_mat[num_feat*i + j] = lhs[num_feat*i + j] ## operator ## buf[num_feat*i + j]
@sonney2k	lhs[num_feat*i + j] ## operator ## buf[num_feat*i + j]
@sonney2k	and operator then is += etc?
@sonney2k	instead of creating a new one?
@sonney2k	gsomix, ^
 gsomix	sonney2k, what do you mean? it works for DenseFeature+(*, -)=DenseFeatures and for DenseFeatures+(*,-)=numpy.array
 gsomix	sonney2k, oops, my fault
 gsomix	one moment
 blackburn	gsomix: but you treat it inplace
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	blackbrun, is there a test for the store_model_features of multi class kernel machine?
 blackburn	heiko: nein
 blackburn	it is not even implemented
 blackburn	I am afraid
 heiko	it is
 heiko	I bet this is causing the errors
 heiko	wrong sv indices
 blackburn	heiko: ohh
 blackburn	that can be
 wiking	heiko: that has been implemented in a rush afaik
 heiko	Chiyuan Zhang wrote it
 blackburn	heiko: ok this describes gmnp failure
 blackburn	but larank still to fix
 heiko	The only thing is that why works it for libsvm multiclass
 blackburn	interesting
 wiking	heiko: when the new machines were introduced somebody realised that cv doesnt work for  kernelmachines
 wiking	i mean kernel multiclass machines
 yoo	heiko: one thg I havnt checked is the sv indices. I m double checking.
 wiking	and then it got implemented fast...
 wiking	that was like 2-3 months ago
 wiking	rather 3
 heiko	mmmh
 wiking	heiko: you can check the correspoinding chat logs for the git commit date...
 heiko	we need more tests ...
 heiko	this should be captured automatically
 heiko	but it works for libsvm so I will search for the differences
 wiking	heiko: CMulticlassLibLinear?
 heiko	wiking, have a look at MultiClassLibSVM
 heiko	.cpp
 heiko	line 197
 heiko	there I wrote a fix for this problem
 heiko	which is rather unefficient, but works
 heiko	I think this would be needed for the other multi class svms too
 gsomix	compling...
 heiko	its almost the only difference between working and not-working implementations
 heiko	and whats this?
 heiko	svm_svs()=SGVector<index_t>(m_kernel->get_num_vec_lhs());

 heiko	yoo, its a bit more complicated, Ill have to dive a bit into it so it may take some time ...
 yoo	heiko: ok. guide me to help if needed. what type of fix did u do for MultiClassLibSVM ?
 heiko	yoo, there was a simila problem and I just put in a hack where I just stored *all* SV
 heiko	so the problem is probably related to wrongly set SVs
@sonney2k	wiking, can you test whether make tests works on your buildslave?
 heiko	but I currently cannot oversee that all
 heiko	has to be debugged step by step unfortunately
 wiking	sonney2k: sec
@sonney2k	wiking, to do so just go into the build/src directory
 heiko	which is a lot of work
@sonney2k	then run make install
@sonney2k	make tests
 yoo	heiko: arf
 heiko	yoo, yes annoying
 wiking	sonney2k: ah usual stuff: #!/bin/bash
 wiking	sonney2k: in check.sh
 wiking	sonney2k: should i replace it or will you to #!/usr/bin/env bash
 wiking	?
 yoo	heiko: I will then check the mailing list to be aware of any fix for this bug.
 yoo	thx
 heiko	yoo, I fear there currently is not
 heiko	is has to be "really" fixed
@sonney2k	wiking, I am doing... but just replace it locally and try to get it to work...
@sonney2k	maybe there is more
 wiking	ok trying
 wiking	Error expanding embedded variable.
 wiking	wht is this?
 wiking	ah ok i know
 wiking	so the problem is that ./check.sh calls make
 wiking	but it should call gmake on freebsd
 wiking	will replace it locally just to test it
 wiking	ok that solved the problem
 wiking	woah but there's a problem with compilation

@sonney2k	wiking, wait your gcc is 3.X sth?
 gsomix	sonney2k, fixed
 wiking	sonney2k: noup.. i think it's more that it tries to use the wrong lib
@sonney2k	gsomix, looking
@sonney2k	wiking, do you run make check-examples from the build/src dir?
 wiking	sonney2k: gmake tests
 wiking	i did this
 CIA-18	shogun: Evgeniy Andreev master * rb5127eb / (2 files in 2 dirs): inplace arithmetic operators for dense features - http://git.io/Av3-fQ
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rdb85eb2 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Merge pull request #650 from gsomix/buffer_protocol - http://git.io/aTWcrA
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah that is the same
@sonney2k	gsomix, alright - could you then tomorrow do slicing support?
 wiking	sonney2k: apparently not ;)
 wiking	i mean make != gmake on bsd
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok
 gsomix	sonney2k, tnx for review
@sonney2k	gsomix, thanks for the code :)
@sonney2k	btw wiking, gsomix did you send your weekly report yet?
 gsomix	sonney2k, I'm writing now.
 wiking	sonney2k: so there should be a variable in the check.sh for make
 wiking	or seomthing
@sonney2k	wiking, sure but you can patch this locally for now
 wiking	sonney2k: i did it
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r6b69c17 / src/shogun/multiclass/LaRank.cpp : Fixed larank multiple training issue - http://git.io/je1UZA
@sonney2k	wiking, I am rather interested in understanding why you get such weird erros
 wiking	i just need to find outnow about those build errors
@sonney2k	wiking, grep M_widen_init /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libs* -r
@sonney2k	Binary file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 matches

 shogun-buildbot	build #154 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/154  blamelist: Evgeniy Andreev <gsomix@gmail.com>
 wiking	sonney2k: the problem about the compiling: the c++ has not been set in the right way...
 wiking	sonney2k: the configure script doesn't set it
 wiking	sonney2k: in examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile the CC variable should be set by ./configure script
 wiking	as now it's always CC=c++ which in this box will fail as the whole shogun has been built with c++46
 wiking	which is set by the configure script
 wiking	sonney2k: if i replace CC=c++46 in that Makefile then it compiles

 wiking	ok this part i dont get yet:
 wiking	running basic_minimal .. ERROR
 wiking	/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.11 required by //usr/home/wiking/shogun-buildbot/bsd1_-_libshogun/build/src/build/lib/libshogun.so.12 not found
 wiking	ok i think there's a problem with linking
 wiking	since it's actually according to ldd libshogun.so.12 is requiring /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 but it should use /usr/local/lib/gcc46/libstdc++.so.6 instead since that's the one for c++46 on my system...
