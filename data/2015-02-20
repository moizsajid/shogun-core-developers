 kingsley_	Hi
 kingsley_	For what it's worth, I ran the AI (Artificial Intelligence) Forum in Silicon Valley in the 1990s.
 kingsley_	It has been fun to watch machine learning advance over the years.
 kingsley_	Today I'd like to write a bash shell script that accepts comma separated variables on its standard input, and reports on standard output a.) a formula that predicts one of the input columns as a function of the others, and optionally b.) some measure(s) of how accurate the prediction is..
 kingsley_	I'm interested in using Shogun's command line interface within the shell script.
 kingsley_	So, I'm about to learn more about Shogun by watching the YouTube video named "Shogun Toolbox Workshop 2014: Introduction by Heiko Strathmann (1/6) ".
 kingsley_	I hope that Shogun's command line interface allows it to
 kingsley_	1.) Split categorical variables in multiple binary variables,
 kingsley_	2.) normalize input data so all input variables have similar means and standard deviations,

-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@59.177.135.40] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 kingsley_	5.) report the model that worked best, plus maybe
 kingsley_	6.) some standard measures of how accurate its predictions are, like residuals, area under the curve, or standard error.
 kingsley_	I also hope Shogun can report the best model and coefficients in plain text as a mathematical formula like...
 kingsley_	variable1 = 1.23 * variable2 + 4.56 * variable3 + 7.89 * variable4
 kingsley_	so it can easily be migrated to other applications.
* kingsley_ will be back later....

 kingsley_	Hmmm... now that I see that the command line's static interface is evidently just for simple experiments.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: hey
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: Hello
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: yeah I'd not recommend static for you
@lisitsyn	it would be better to use python
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@120.59.197.201] has joined #shogun
 kingsley_	Maybe the modular interface to python would be better for the possibly ambitious goals I described 8 hours ago.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: yes
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: well most of things are easy to do with shogun
@lisitsyn	but would take some learning curve indeed..
@lisitsyn	by 1) you mean one-hot encoding?
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: If I ask you nicely, will you please tell me if you happen to know of any sample python code that shows how to call shogun to do the stuff I wrote about 8 hours ago?
-!- prakhar2511 [~prakhar25@202.78.175.199] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: well I can write that if you have some time to wait
* kingsley_ looks up "one-hot encoding"...
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: it is just a mapping of category to a vector of zeros but one at position associated with this category
@lisitsyn	like red=1,0,0
@lisitsyn	blue=0,0,1
@lisitsyn	and green=0,1,0
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: Yes, I'd like to automate that mapping.

 kingsley_	And yes, that was the first goal I listed 8 hours ago.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: ok then what if I write up this thing a bit later today and send it to you?
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: Well, well, well!
 kingsley_	That's a very nice offer.
 kingsley_	Thank you very much.
 kingsley_	I'd be happy to see whatever you think would be appropriate.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: I am just curious what is the best way to do that within current stuff in shogun
@lisitsyn	so it would be a good way to 'test' api ;)
@lisitsyn	sounds like usual case
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: but I have to warn you I'd probably get some time only this evening :)
@lisitsyn	no idea what's your timezone though
 kingsley_	I think it would be nearly impossible for you to have less experience with shogun than I, but it seems to me that so called "one-hot encoding" might be either a stand along python function, or be and option to either reading input data like a .csv file, or an option to feature selection or dimensional reduction code.
 kingsley_	s/and option/an option/
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: no surely not python function but yeah it would be something easy to do
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: feature selection is probably good with PCA and lasso
-!- kshitijk [~kshitijk@115.249.18.25] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 kingsley_	It also seems to me that the hard part is reliably knowing when a variable contains categorical data that can safely be split into multiple binary variables. Maybe the presence of alphabetical characters like [a-zA-Z] would be a start, as would checking of purely numeric data has a common distribution. I guess another option would be to just let the user specify which input variables should be recoded.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: actually what you describe could be done with quite native R
@lisitsyn	probably with even better support for that
@lisitsyn	I have to admit they do really support categorical stuff better :)
 kingsley_	Maybe you have forgotten more than I know, but my research into R's data mining packages like caret and rminer suggested to me that the best models they found would remain encoded in R objects, rather than reported as text formulas as I described 8 hours ago, soon after 6.).
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: hmm should be possible to extract the stuff still
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: we don't have such functions like reporting in a formula as well anyway
 kingsley_	But I suppose if there's an R function for just "one-hot encoding", that might be useful.
@lisitsyn	but that sounds like a cool idea
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: it works directly on categorical features - I don't remember how
 kingsley_	Can shogun try to fit input data with several models, like multiple linear regression, support vector machines and multi-layer perceptrons, and report how well each worked?
 kingsley_	Or is that the user's job, say, in a python wrapper?
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: yeah unfortunately it is user job to try all of them
@lisitsyn	and then evaluate each
@lisitsyn	evaluation is here though
@lisitsyn	you can compute 'answers' and check its auROC or so
@lisitsyn	but no high-level thing like you describe (but I'd agree we should have it)
 kingsley_	So when the user finds a the best model, what format does shogun report that model and its coefficients in?
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: you can get the weight vector from SVM, get coefficients from MLP and so on
@lisitsyn	but no pretty format way again
@lisitsyn	well if your models are big it would not be really readable :)
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: Everything you wrote makes sense, and I am grateful for your time and attention.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: you're welcome
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: I am putting some tasks on github so that we can fix that
 kingsley_	I will only humbly add that formatting the best model and coefficients as a text formula would have a subtle advantage, even for big models.
 kingsley_	The answer could be more easily migrated to other applications.
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: yeah I am going to add a task so someone will add a way to do that
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2727
 kingsley_	I said it before.
 kingsley_	I'll say it again.
 kingsley_	Thanks!
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: can I refer your github profile if there is any?
 kingsley_	Sorry, I'm not on github.
* kingsley_ wonders if python-sklearn has any useful code.
@lisitsyn	ok no problem
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: oh they did
@lisitsyn	sorry do
@lisitsyn	;)
@lisitsyn	it is pretty easy I admit
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2728 ok that's the issue for human readable stuff
-!- prakhar2511 [~prakhar25@202.78.175.199] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 kingsley_	2728 looks good to me.
 kingsley_	Can shogun normalize input data so all input variables have similar means and standard deviations?
@lambday	lisitsyn: good for feature selection stuffs as well
@lambday	+1
@lambday	although not always the features will be having meaningful names..
@lambday	we can default the names to feat0....featN then :D
@lisitsyn	lambday: yeah they usually don't have names
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: yes
@lambday	lisitsyn: and you're thinking of get_feature_by_name() as well?
 kingsley_	lambday: Yes, maybe if the user wants features to have meaningful names, he or she can add a row of meaningful variable names (ie: a header) to the top of an input .csv file.
@lisitsyn	lambday: yes probably
@lambday	lisitsyn: would be cool if we can read those names in data.names file which is there in most of the cases
@lisitsyn	lambday: probably we should have a CFeature class
@lambday	+1
@lambday	nice idea
@lisitsyn	lambday: and we should merge labels and features :)
@lisitsyn	it is one entity
@lambday	lisitsyn: sometimes that's really useful :D
@lambday	lisitsyn: just one matrix stores it all.. the last column is for labels
@lambday	features will then just be a block...
@lisitsyn	lambday: in statistics they really can predict any column
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah... just change the target column will do the trick
-!- kshitijk [~kshitijk@115.249.18.25] has joined #shogun
 kingsley_	If I might humbly add another reason to output text models like ...
 kingsley_	variable1 = 1.23 * variable2 + 4.56 * variable3 + 7.89 * variable4
@lambday	kingsley_: you want to *print* this linear model
@lambday	useful
 kingsley_	it would be that symbolic math programs like "mathomatic" can manipulate them symbolically, which includes factoring, differentiation, and solving.
@lisitsyn	x = sigm(0, max(0,2*y+z) + max(0,6*z-y) + max(0,9*z-14y))
@lisitsyn	:D
 kingsley_	lambday: I happened to notice that you wrote ... "kingsley_: you want to *print* this linear model". I'm not sure I understand you. Please elaborate.
@lambday	kingsley_: I assumed that you're talking about having the model printed in terms of features in order to establish the importance of feature names :)
 kingsley_	lambday: Yes, you assumed right.
-!- vortex_ape [~vortex_ap@120.59.197.201] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 kingsley_	But to be fair, I can imagine including feature names in models having several benefits:
 kingsley_	1.) As you say, easily recognizing which features are important.
 kingsley_	2.) As Sergey wrote in 2728, being able to export the model to a spread sheet.
 kingsley_	3.) Exporting the model to mathomatic, Latex, shell scripts, C, etc...
 kingsley_	4.) Maybe more easily revealing hidden structure in the data.
-!- prakhar2511 [~prakhar25@115.249.18.25] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	good
@lisitsyn	that's pretty cool
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: we definitely will add that
@lisitsyn	at least for linear classifiers
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: Thank you for your kind words and willingness.
@lisitsyn	thanks for the idea ;)
 kingsley_	You're welcome.
 kingsley_	lisitsyn: New topic:
 kingsley_	Are you multi-lingual?
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: multi-lingual like? :)
@lisitsyn	english is not my native if you mean it
 kingsley_	Yes, I was wondering if I was chatting with some smart enough to understand more than one human language AND technology AND who is very polite.
 kingsley_	These are all fine qualities.
@lisitsyn	haha :) kingsley_ same for lambday
 kingsley_	Awesome
 kingsley_	I like smart people.
@lisitsyn	yeah they are better :)
@lisitsyn	kingsley_: shogun is developed by guys from germany(sonney2k), russia (me), india (lambday) and a few more countries
* kingsley_ looks at scikit-learn's documentation to see if it has some code that may format models...
@lisitsyn	afaik they don't have any kind of formatting
@lisitsyn	at least one point we can take advantage :)
 kingsley_	OK, /me looks at mlpy's documentation to see if it has some code that may format models...
@lisitsyn	I think pandas has something on that
@lisitsyn	lambday: haha take a look my vim got crazy and I tried to compile 'Pools.Dequeue(&&&&&&&&removedPool);'
@lisitsyn	that would be C++2051

 Utsav	Fuzzy Logic gives a more intuitive way of thinking .. much more understandable to humans and better error tolerance
 Utsav	The decision at each node in a decision tree would involve fuzzy logic and the splitting attribute would also be selected based on fuzzy information gain
 Utsav	I was just giving an example how it could work out
@lisitsyn	sure, are there any well established algorithms?
 Utsav	A lot of research papers have been and are being published in this field
@lambday	^ I was going to ask
@lisitsyn	Utsav: actually Heiko planned to propose a project on bayesian trees
 Utsav	Fuzzy Decision Trees do return a lot of results when googled ... and I was studying a few lately
@lisitsyn	that's something similar but in bayesian fashion
 Utsav	Mine involves a good use of Fuzzy Logic ... with a variety of implementations of different member ship functions that fuzzy logic has to offer
 Utsav	So  I was wondering if it sounds good enough to be contemplated upon ..
@lisitsyn	Utsav: sounds good but you'd have to talk to these guys: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_project_fundamental
@lisitsyn	they have something on mind already
 Utsav	I just see Kalman Filter there ... I have already done a project on Kalman Filters :D
 Utsav	Nothing too advanced though
 Utsav	But helped me understand how it works
@lisitsyn	yeah they are not on fuzzy but probabilistic
@lisitsyn	I can't really compare them but probabilistic sounds like more theoretically based
 Utsav	indeed ... I don't see fuzzy logic involved
@lisitsyn	while fuzzy is more about some heuristics
@lambday	Utsav: could you briefly explain how fuzzy works for decision trees?
 Utsav	sure ...
@lambday	Utsav: or point me to some paper that you've read on this topic
 Utsav	most certainly ... I was going to suggest that
 Utsav	one sec ..
 Utsav	http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=343539&tag=1
 Utsav	I guess this one would give a good explaination
 Utsav	*explanation
@lisitsyn	29 citations ;)
@lisitsyn	in google scholar it is 199 though
 Utsav	Is it good ? (Not much experience with publishing papers ! )
@lisitsyn	199 is pretty popular yeah
@lisitsyn	svm is cited by 16597 papers though
@lisitsyn	:D
 Utsav	that is a huge number
@lisitsyn	and CART is cited by 26911 papers
 Utsav	Also ... an extension of fuzzy decision trees would be fuzzy random forests
@lisitsyn	yeah quite natural extension
@lambday	Utsav: I would strongly suggest that you share your ideas to a mail to fernando and heiko, cc-ing the mailing list
 Utsav	And this paper gave explicit membership values to variables ... which could be replaced with different types of membership functions
@lambday	organize your thoughts and see if you can accommodate these ideas alongwith fundamental ML 2 project
@lambday	can't access the pdf.. :(
@lambday	gotta ask my insti friends
 Utsav	So you feel that this idea has some scope to be taken ahead ( a small chance maybe) ?
 Utsav	I would definitely try to organise it
@lambday	Utsav: yeah but fernando and heiko are the guys to talk for that :)
 Utsav	Looking forward to it .. :)
 Utsav	And, my programming experience is not very advanced - sort of intermediate ... is that ok ?
 Utsav	I am willing to put in an effort to learn as much as I can though :)
@lambday	Utsav: that's good! we expect some fluency with C++ though.. some design patterns.. but as long as you can pick things up quickly on your way its cool
@lambday	also, it would be worth to get familiar with shogun codebase as well
 Utsav	How do I do that ?
@lambday	Utsav: best way is to start with make/install/run shogun.. run the examples.. next is to aim at issues on github..
 Utsav	ok .. will try to do that ! Thanks a lot
@lambday	once you think you have solved some bug/enhancement, send a pull request
@lambday	yw :)

 AS	hi all, I'm trying to install & run Shogun. Cmake, make, make install -- all seemingly finish with no errors. However, many of the tests fail (especially, python_modular-related but not all of them) and simple python scripts that use Shogun object are segfault-ing. Anyone has ideas?

@lambday	AS:  I'm afraid you haven't cloned shogun data
 AS	You mean I should run ctest from the data directory?
@lambday	AS: no that should be run from the build directory only
@lambday	AS: just check if you have the data in shogun/data

@thoralf	Hey lovely people :)
@thoralf	besser82: Around?

@lambday	AS: yeah git is better
@thoralf	Hay lambday
@lambday	thoralf: hey! long time

@lambday	thoralf: how are you doing?
@thoralf	lambday: I'm fine.  Just realized GSoC is getting hot now :)
@lambday	thoralf: haha yeah! its that time our commits/month ratio overshoots
 AS	lambday: well, the git version does not even compile

@lambday	AS: really! let me check
@lambday	AS: src looks fine! maybe I am missing something. don't have a machine right now where I can experiment. Will be able to test only after an hour
@lambday	AS: meanwhile, you can just link the shogun/data to the unzipped data directory you have..
@lambday	for shogun-4.0.0
 AS	lambday: yes, just did that -- same errors
@lambday	AS: hang on. will get back soon!
 AS	lambday: ok! just thoughts: ok, even if that solves the issue with tests, the python code I'm trying to follow (the FGM notebook: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/FGM.html) is still giving me segmentation fault once I try to create some shogun object (specifically on cell 9)
@lambday	AS: ah I figured it out. Will send a patch as soon as I get my machine :)

@lambday	AS: this one?? samples, labels = prepare_data(p_tr, l_tr, ftype_all, n_tr_samples)
 AS	lambday: soory, the previous cell. Actually I traced it down to "fac_type_u = TableFactorType(0, cards_u, w_gt_u)". Once it's created, even exiting from the script results in segfault
@lambday	AS: ah that's bad. maybe these things depend on some dependencies you don't have installed?
@lambday	checking
 AS	lambday: That's what thought too, but cmake did not complain.
 AS	lambday: only a strange line "-- The following REQUIRED packages have not been found:   * OpenCL"
@lambday	AS: nah that's not it
@lambday	AS: can you please try running this instead?
@lambday	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/structure_factor_graph_model.py
 AS	lambday: hang on
 AS	lambday: got the same line "Segmentation fault"
 AS	lambday: could be because of some python version mismatch? the environment here is kind of a mixture of 2.6 and 2.7
@lambday	AS: multiple versions of python can be there in the same system.. shouldn't be a problem
@lambday	AS: I assume that it must be some installation issue. cause I see buildbot happy here http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2605
@lambday	AS: please note that many of our methods currently requires Eigen3 library
@lambday	without that, many methods will be unavailable
@lambday	so Id' try installing eigen3-devel and then freshly make shogun
 AS	ok, will try. thank you for your help!

@HeikoS	lambday: ah yeah, my bad for merging that
@HeikoS	lambday: thanks
@HeikoS	lambday: could you reference wu in the patch? so that he know for the future?
@lambday	HeikoS: we should have these tests in travis only
@HeikoS	lambday: what do you mena?
@HeikoS	mean
@lambday	HeikoS: absolutely
@lambday	HeikoS: in travis these parts don't even compile.. so we won't get to know from travis if there are some errors
@lambday	HeikoS: in buildbots I guess we have eigen3 everywhere
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	so you want a build where eigen is disabled?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah - only the *REQUIRED* packages should be there
@HeikoS	I guess wiking is the one to ask
@lambday	so that we know that our builds are sane even withtout the optional pkgs
@HeikoS	I agree we should have a check for that
@HeikoS	lambday: could you write a request to shogun-team and cc wiking?
@lambday	HeikoS: absolutely
@lambday	will do that after the fix
@HeikoS	lambday: thanks for taking care!
@lambday	HeikoS: I need to rename eigen3 and viennacl to something tmp in order to prevent cmake from finding them :D do you know a better way?
@lambday	cmake should have something like -DDisableEigen3 -DDisableViennaCL
@HeikoS	lambday: I agree that should be a switch
@HeikoS	lambday: cant be too hard to add
@HeikoS	I think I added something like that recently
@HeikoS	for a guy who wanted to disable something
@HeikoS	that was found on his system
@HeikoS	ah yeah

@lambday	HeikoS: oh so what's the switch?

 attia42	hello, I have been trying LMNN and it doesn't seem to use multi threads while training. (it uses multi threads at first but then not, guessing it's only during  pairwise distances calculations). is it possible to make it use more threads? any references other than the  LMNN ipython tutorial ?
@HeikoS	attia42: I think the main method is single thread
@HeikoS	attia42: write to iglesias (Fernando, who wrote the code) to ask him on that, cc the mailing list
@HeikoS	attia42: all Shogun distance methods use multiple threads
@HeikoS	attia42: I am not sure whether its possible to parallelise LMNN easily even? Isnt the solver iterative?
 attia42	@HeikoS iterative gradient based updates HeikoS
