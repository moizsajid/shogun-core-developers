@HeikoS	thoralf: any updates on the mac build?
@HeikoS	wiking: any updates on the docker and ubuntu
@wiking	HeikoS: done expect anything till next week or after
@wiking	*dont
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	just asking
@wiking	yeah i'm just sayin
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, just want to keep momentum from the workshop up a bit
@HeikoS	wiking: how is your new place and the country?
@wiking	hehe your momentum
@wiking	i wasn't there :)
@wiking	and stream wasnt available either...
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah the stream would have been nice
@HeikoS	wiking: but well, i am happy that we have at least the footage
@HeikoS	wiking: i hope besser82 will deal with the videos soon
@wiking	how's our status btw?
@wiking	could we afford another fatbot in case?
@wiking	as i guess fatbot is being paid by the gsoc mentor income
@besser82	HeikoS, I'm currently re-muxing the vids...  Will start to upload soon...
@besser82	HeikoS, re-muxing like doing linearization and dynamic compression of the audio and cutting
@wiking	besser82: last time i just cut it and then did a full hd conversion and then uploaded it to googs
@besser82	HeikoS, got the yt-credentials from Fernando already ^^
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS asked me to do linearization and dynamic compression, so the sound will be a bit better understandable...
 shogun-buildbot	build #2428 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2428
@HeikoS	wiking: we could if its really needed
@HeikoS	wiking: though would be better to get some smaller donations here and there
@wiking	HeikoS: ok lets see how the next months goes
@wiking	but i reckon we will need something
@wiking	as we are already missing for example the building of latest ubuntu LTS
@wiking	(i.e. a new buildbot)
@HeikoS	wiking: i see
@wiking	so either somebody sponsors us a machine
@HeikoS	wiking: could you maybe find out a concrete offer for that and write an email to the team where you point out the current limitations and suggest a scale of upgrade?
@wiking	(we need at least 5 gigs of free ram since u cannot compile modular interfaces with less ram)
@HeikoS	wiking: would be keen on getting another machine if that solves installation problems ;)
@wiking	offer?
@HeikoS	wiking: many people asked me what we need also btw, so good to write this down
@HeikoS	wiking: offer as in how much  it is to rent another fatbot
@wiking	need hw
@HeikoS	besser82: cool, looking forward to iit
@wiking	mmm the same as it's currently?
@wiking	i dont know how much does it cost atm
@wiking	as far as i can recall it is around 30 eur/month
@wiking	or something like that
@wiking	or 39
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	wiking: we could double this
@wiking	sonne|work: would know that the best as he has organised the whole thing
@HeikoS	wiking: did sonney2k_ rent the thing?
@wiking	i.e. ordering etc.
@HeikoS	wiking: ok i see

@HeikoS	wiking: then we can have more slaves, eg for the docker, and for the new linalg stuff
@HeikoS	and for the binary ubuntu packages
@HeikoS	wiking: and the travis notebook rendering addition
@wiking	well for linalg we have a little bit of problem
@wiking	besser82: here?
@besser82	wiking, nope, there  :-P
@wiking	besser82: i7 CPU         930  @ 2.80GHz
@besser82	wiking, yes?
@wiking	is this something that supports opencl?
 shogun-buildbot	build #2256 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test cmdline]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/2256  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@wiking	^ brokent shiats
@besser82	wiking, not directly  :(
@wiking	soemebody fixit right away!
@besser82	wiking, but i think it can with pocl
@wiking	HeikoS: so that's a tricky thing
@wiking	if we want to test linalg backend
@HeikoS	wiking: i see, well we can test the linalg with eigen3 backend for now
@besser82	wiking, do we _really_ need ocl hw?!?
@HeikoS	wiking: because then we at least can use the interface
@wiking	we need a machine that has opencl support or some sort of gpu
@besser82	wiking, there is pocl
@HeikoS	wiking: and then we just need to test the methods on vienna once we figured out how to use
@wiking	besser82: well we want to be able to test viennacl
@besser82	wiking, runs with pocl ;)
@wiking	besser82: it's not the sam
@HeikoS	wiking: cant one emulate viennacl without gpu hardware?P
@wiking	HeikoS: even if it can it's not the same
@besser82	HeikoS, yes, through pocl  ;)
@besser82	but as wiking says, not the same as real hw...
@besser82	because it uses the llvm-pipe sw-renderer somehow...
@wiking	fatbot has: 06:04.0 VGA compatible controller: Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G200eW WPCM450 (rev 0a)
@wiking	so this is shiatz
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe get a machine which has a small gpu then for the new bot?
 shogun-buildbot	build #2449 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2449  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>
@wiking	besser82: do u know this: Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller
@wiking	?
@besser82	wiking, yes, i know
@besser82	wiking, that should be able to do native ocl ^^
@wiking	i7-3770
@wiking	thi sis what my freebsd is running on
@wiking	(hetzner.de)
@wiking	it's ivy bridge
@wiking	that should be able to support as well opencl
@besser82	wiking, afaik yes...

@HeikoS	wiking: besser82 so then this should solve it, another reason to get another fatbot
@wiking	the gpu supports opencl 1.2
@besser82	HeikoS, from me POV, too ^^
@wiking	dunno though what's the status of the latest hetzner server

@wiking	so this is for 49 eur/month
@wiking	http://www.hetzner.de/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex40
@HeikoS	wiking: might visit him at tomtom today
@wiking	cool
@wiking	but dunno what sorts of gpu would this machine have
@wiking	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/core-i7-4770k-haswell-performance,3461-3.html
@wiking	but actually we dont care where the machine is
@wiking	so we should check for the cheapest one
@wiking	maybe even an amazon instance would be good
@wiking	or
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@HeikoS	wiking: i agree
@wiking	i'm just checking for aws then
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@HeikoS	wiking: im getting some food now, will be back in a bit
@wiking	mmm actually what we could do
@wiking	is to setup a latent aws instance
@wiking	that is, we run it only till we need it
@wiking	i.e. to run the test of buildbot
@wiking	i know that buildbot supports this
@HeikoS	wiking: cheaper?
@wiking	HeikoS: well think about it
@wiking	let say we run 4 builds/day
@wiking	on average
@wiking	i.e. we have 4 commits/day average
@wiking	and each build takes like 30 minutes
@wiking	that's 2 hours/day only
@wiking	istead of paying for a full day
@wiking	right?
@wiking	i know aws only supports per hour billing but still
@wiking	then it would be 4 hours vs 24 hours
@wiking	$0.650 per Hour
@wiking	a gpu instance
@wiking	well that's too much
@wiking	0.65*4*30
@wiking	78 usd/moth
@wiking	*month
@wiking	for that we can already rent a full machine
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah doesnt seem better then
@HeikoS	wiking: i think its also good to have a full machine since we then *know* how much it is, even if the loads increases

 sonne|work	wiking: did you check wether ovh via kimsufi has some el cheapo servers?
 sonne|work	wiking: like http://www.soyoustart.com/en/offers/game-2.xml
@wiking	sonne|work: no i haven't checked really into the things... i was just wondering if we can afford to invest into another dedicated server (as aws wasn't the best option)
 sonne|work	well surely another 30EUR / month won't make a difference like the server above would cost
 sonne|work	actually
 sonne|work	it is a beta test thing
 sonne|work	running out tomorrow
 sonne|work	so I guess it will be 60EUR/month
 sonne|work	wiking: we have www & fatbot so far ~60EUR/month currently
@wiking	could we live with another extra 30-40 EUR/month?
@wiking	i.e. ~100 eur/month as shogun expense?
 sonne|work	well as long as we get gsoc money yes
 sonne|work	(or some other funding)
@wiking	1 gsoc is about 500 usd rith?
@wiking	*right?
@wiking	so about 3 gsoc project would cover a year's expense?
 sonne|work	yeah
 sonne|work	3-4
@wiking	now the question that's remains for how long could we keep up from this moment on without gsoc-ing?
@wiking	btw that game 2 server is insanely cheep
@wiking	*cheap
@wiking	although having only 1 disk in it scares me a bit
 sonne|work	fatbot also only has one disk
 sonne|work	wiking: well beta stage - it will be 60 EUR/month
@wiking	really? i thought it has softraid
@wiking	12.49EUR HT /14 jours
@wiking	so 25 eur/month
@wiking	14,86 EUR / 14 Tage if we order via the german site :P
@wiking	i guess lower VAT
 sonne|work	well it is 50% of the price only during the beta phase which ends tomorrow
@wiking	ah so even if we order today
@wiking	they are going to raise the price
 sonne|work	yes they will double it
@wiking	man that's aweful i thought if we order it now we'll have this price for at least a year or something
 sonne|work	no the offer says it cannot be extended beyond the 14 days
@wiking	:<
@wiking	ok then it's expensive since then it's 45 EUR/month and we could get the same machine for 49 eur/month but with 2x2 tb sata disks

 sonne|work	wiking: ok - so why don't we just order it then?
 sonne|work	wiking: we can survive 2 years at least

@wiking	i would still look around

@wiking	maybe we can find a cheaper deal
 sonne|work	sure do it
 sonne|work	if you haven't found anything cheaper by tomorrow we order it
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah but i have no information about the shogun toolbox thing / bank account
@wiking	so i cannot order it :)
@wiking	otherwise i would do it
@wiking	i'm pretty satisfied with hetzner
@wiking	(i'm with them for like 5 years now...)

@wiking	sonne|work: so i guess u can order :)
@wiking	besser82: when can i kill the fc19 bot?
@wiking	i.e switch to fc20 bot
@besser82	wiking, actually now ;)
@besser82	wiking, you need clean fc20-chroot?!?
@wiking	do  ?
@wiking	do i need one?
@besser82	wiking, i dunno?  do you have one?
@besser82	wiking, if not, I can easiely bootstrap one...  ;)
@wiking	i have one you've sent me the last time
@besser82	wiking, that should be good ^^
@wiking	i'm just running yum -y distro-sync
@besser82	that's a good idea  ^^
@wiking	besser82: so i can kill the fc19 bot?
@besser82	wiking, yes fc19 is basically dead...

@besser82	wiking, np yw  :D
@wiking	besser82: lapack-devel.x86_64 or lapack64-devel.x86_64
@wiking	?

@wiking	lambday: yo
@wiking	welcome around
 lambday	wiking: hi
 lambday	wiking: trying to have a look at the unittest error on bsd
 lambday	not finding the reason
@wiking	if u need any other info let me know
 lambday	yeah
 lambday	but I configured locally without lapack and it worked
 lambday	wiking: is there any difference in the random number generator?
@wiking	lambday: it's the same
@wiking	this was one of the reasons why we imported the PRNG into shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: this thing here modshogunPINVOKE.cs(9270,141): error CS0100: The parameter name `rows' is a duplicate
 sonne|work	wiking: is pretty simple to fix
@wiking	sonne|work: how? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: you need to find a function that gets two SGMatrix<T> as input
@wiking	sonne|work: modshogunPINVOKE.cs is being generated automaticly by swig
 sonne|work	and then add this to the modshogun_ignores.i
 lambday	wiking: all the other unit-tests work of BAHSIC and everything else it depends on work too :/
@wiking	sonne|work: lol? :)))))
@wiking	sonne|work: basically disable that function in c# ?
 sonne|work	the problem is that the generated wrapper code does not rename the typemap variables so you get duplicates
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
 sonne|work	we already did that like 10 times
@wiking	sonne|work: actually that will disable it in all modular interfaces
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	there is an ifdef
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	lemme test it then
@wiking	before commiting
@wiking	thnx ... i still feel that its'a bit bruteforce solution :)))
 lambday	oh so it doesn't have BLAS too
 lambday	trying without configuring blas/lapack
@wiking	besser82: i have a little bit of a problem in RH
@wiking	--> Finished Dependency Resolution
@wiking	Error: Package: pulseaudio-libs-5.0-8.fc22.x86_64 (rawhide)
@wiking	           Requires: libjson-c.so.3()(64bit)
@wiking	 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
@wiking	 You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest
@wiking	besser82: instrucations?
@wiking	sonne|work: btw if u have a chance plz email the maintainer of the cygwin and rpm bot to restart them
@besser82	wiking, rawhide is currently b0rk3n...
 sonne|work	wiking: I did - no response :/
@wiking	:<
@wiking	besser82: okie
@besser82	wiking, but I'll prepare some fc21-chroot later  ;)
@wiking	besser82: kk
@besser82	wiking, fc21 is upcoming alpha ^^
@besser82	wiking, releases somewhen mid. Oct...

@besser82	wiking, you can speed up build time a lot, if you install ccache into fc-buildbot  ;)
@besser82	wiking, yum install ccache -y
@besser82	wiking, gets activated automatically  ;)
@wiking	besser82: yeah i know i wrote it :)
@wiking	that's why i'm just doing the rebuild actually
@besser82	wiking, yes  ^^  but on fc ccache is done by symlinks as well  ;)
