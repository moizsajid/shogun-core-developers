 Raju	Hello, I was trying to install Shogun on CentOS? Will it work? and also, I posted this question in stack overflow.
@wiking	yes
@wiking	it will
@wiking	which version?
 Raju	CentOS 6
 Raju	I am not familiar in using Linux machine, trying to use Shogun for my research.  I went through all the steps to install Sogun as in the documentation and also quickstart steps in github.
 Raju	I am not sure wether I am missing something.
 Raju	I downloaded the Shogun source from the website and installed all the requirements for it. I found 2 steps to install 1) ./configure make make install 2) mkdir build cd build cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 lupinix	Raju: you have to use CentOS 6? i'm remembering several issues with old libraries and swig there... we have packages in Fedora
* lupinix is one of the maintainers @Fedora and EPEL community repo for EL
 lupinix	i think pure C++ stuff will work
 Raju	Not necessay I have to stick with CentOS 6
 lupinix	@CentOS
 Raju	Is there any specific version for Fedora?
 lupinix	Raju: @fedora we have it in our repositories, so you can install without compiling from source
 lupinix	there a "dnf install shogun-devel shogun-data" will install everything you need for C++, in addition for other languages, for example python3-shogun for python3 interface
 Raju	lupinix: Got it. Thank you. I will try it Fedora as well.
 Raju	Does ubuntu have a shogun package?
 lupinix	don't know
 Raju	Thank you.

 Raju	Hello, I installed Shogun in Fedora from the repositories. After that I tried running a simplest libshogun example program. It didn't work. It didn't find <shogun/base/init.h>. Any help please.
 Raju	I used this command "dnf install shogun-devel shogun-data" it installed all the required packages.
