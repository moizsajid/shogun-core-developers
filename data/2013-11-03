 HeikoS	sonney2k: around?
 lisitsyn	hey HeikoS
 lisitsyn	have you seen carols mail?
 HeikoS	or in fact: iglesiasg, sonney2k, wiking, lisitsyn hi! How can I send mails from a shogun-toolbox sender? how does that work?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
 HeikoS	I think its fine, but s?ren should also confirm
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is everything ok in the PO?
 lisitsyn	ah oka
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what did she say?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well in gmail you just select what address you put to the 'from' field :)
 lisitsyn	what exactly do you want?
 HeikoS	no answer
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I configured it in gmail
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: some PO stuff
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, which is?
 HeikoS	iglesiasg, lisitsyn ok so anyone can do that? or just us?
 HeikoS	I want to send the foundation stuff to the list
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: $$ :D
 HeikoS	but somehow want at least a minimal confirmation of my identify belonging to the shogun team
@iglesiasg	I see
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: for travel and gsoc
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not anyone I guess
 lisitsyn	at least from gmail
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just add your shogun email to the configuration
 HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	if it is not yet here
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: IIRC soeren set up redirects
 HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	I mean it works like that:
 lisitsyn	you add mail address, gmail sends a mail to that address
 lisitsyn	you receive it because the redirection is set up already
 lisitsyn	you confirm it and then you can use it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok I see
 lisitsyn	gmail won't let you put any other address
 lisitsyn	if it is not confirmed
 lisitsyn	but some other services may allow that kind of hacking
 lisitsyn	it is called spoofing when you do that 'illegally'
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
 lisitsyn	usually goes directly to the spam folder when it is detected
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: so for foundation, I will just send a signed email to the list
 lisitsyn	yes
 HeikoS	s?ren can then confirm that it is sent by myself
 lisitsyn	the only safe way is signed
 HeikoS	no need for shogun-toolbox sender
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it is ok too but no mean of safety here
 HeikoS	s?ren can send "NOOOO" if the mail is not sent from me
 lisitsyn	yeah probably
 lisitsyn	if it is soeren haha
 HeikoS	community based authentication ;)
 lisitsyn	may be you participate in some secret deal
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: at the summit there was some event
 lisitsyn	about that
 HeikoS	I know
 HeikoS	I mean its fine, just thinking about future when there is money involved
 lisitsyn	ah okay
 HeikoS	we should think about that at some point
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we just go tor and encrypt our message when we sell weapons
 lisitsyn	;)
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha :)
 HeikoS	phone, brb
 lisitsyn	we should think about creating a gang
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: you will be a netherlands lieutenant of our organization!
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	haha ok
