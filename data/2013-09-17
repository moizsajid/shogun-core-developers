 wiking	lisitsyn: what if we start mimicing gstreamer setup?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I don't know about gstreamer
 wiking	lisitsyn: well it's a bunch of .so -s
 wiking	and then you just hook together containers
 wiking	into a pipeline
 lisitsyn	yeah it seems like it is the way
 wiking	hence when u run the pipeline
 wiking	the only thing that is loaded into the memory is the required .sos
 wiking	i mean dylibs
 lisitsyn	yeah or dlls
 lisitsyn	whatever :)
 wiking	yeah ...

 thoralf	Hey.
 besser82	wiking: Why does `make install` place libshogun.so* and other things in /usr/lib although they should go to /usr/lib64 on x86_64?
 besser82	wiking: python_modular and most of the other plugins go to right location....
 sonne|work	besser82: is there  a default?
 sonne|work	wiking: well gstreamer is stripped too

 wiking	besser82: lib_suffix that is?
 besser82	wiking: or "LIB_INSTALL_DIR"
 besser82	wiking: take the one which is easier to implement for you ;)
 besser82	wiking: shall I open an issue on gh for tracking?
 wiking	yeah u can
 wiking	besser82: but LIB_INSTALL_DIR is not always set or?
 besser82	wiking: LIB_SUFFIX either ;)
 wiking	ok then
 besser82	wiking: i'd suggest to wrap it in some conditional... ;)

@HeikoS	besser82: just saw
 besser82	HeikoS: that should do anything needed like we did yesterday ;)
@HeikoS	cool, how to activate it?
@HeikoS	-DUSE_ORIGINAL_LAPACK=On ?
@HeikoS	and probably -DLAPACL_LIBRARIES=/for/bar ?
 besser82	HeikoS: `cmake -DUSE_ORIGINAL_LAPACK=ON`  is enough ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: will automatically PREPEND %{_libdir}/liblapack.so.[0-9]
 besser82	HeikoS: ATLAS stuff will be placed after these, then
 besser82	HeikoS: so the linker should be prefer LAPACK.so, then ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: I might be possible we would need libclapack.so as well, but that should be handled by FindATLAS.cmake
 besser82	HeikoS: which I can implement in the PR, too, if needed...
@HeikoS	okay cool
@HeikoS	lets wait for travis and then merge :)

@HeikoS	being curious
 lambday	HeikoS: took me an hour to install things properly behind proxy
@HeikoS	argh
@HeikoS	annoying
 lambday	HeikoS: just added up to linear solvers
 lambday	HeikoS: but how to port images when viewing  in nbviewer??
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah :( pip install doesn't work even with --proxy :(
@HeikoS	just evaluate all cells, save the notebook, upload it to gist, and put the number into nbviewer
@HeikoS	lambday: ah stupid, well, you dont need cholmod I guess
@HeikoS	since we have a linear solve using sparse LLT in shogun now
@HeikoS	(though its a bit slow)
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah we don't need cholmod
 lambday	HeikoS: but the images... I saved these images in a dir, from which I use markdown to show them
@HeikoS	lambday: what?
@HeikoS	lambday: which images?

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, hey! I am on the integration test from right now
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cool! :)
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I really think though that it happens because I changed the structure of LMNN (added a new member)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yep thats the reason
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, would that explain it?
@HeikoS	changing classes breaks integration tests
@HeikoS	(see my issue :) )
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, mm ok. Does it have to be fixed manually in any case?
@iglesiasg	yep, I remember it
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes you have to update the file
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, all right, let me have a look how this works
@iglesiasg	I guess it should be enough removing the file
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: nono
@HeikoS	in the integration test folder in python modular
@HeikoS	there are two scripts: tester.py and generator.py
@HeikoS	tester.py <your-test-filename> runs the test
@HeikoS	which the travis does
@HeikoS	and generator.py creates a new file for it
@HeikoS	overwriting the old
@HeikoS	if you did this, you have to do two commits:
@HeikoS	first commit the modified files (into the different repository shogun-data)
@HeikoS	second: commit the "data" version in the development branch
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, thanks for the explanation!
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: now you see why I find this annoying btw

@iglesiasg	HeikoS, question
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I did the PR in shogun-data with the new file created by generator.py
@HeikoS	yep
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, and I get the message in shogun repo that the data dir has received new commits. Should I commit this version right away or wait until it is merged?
@iglesiasg	I have no idea really how this versions of submodule work actually
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: as soon as you changed/comitted them locally, you can update the data version
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, all right, I will make the PR right now then. If you have time, have a look
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: OK!
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: you can directly merge the data commit
@HeikoS	since the main repo will only use it when you change the data version

 sonne|work	now you have :P
 Guest55703	thanks!
 Guest55703	weird, tried g++ 4.6 or clang++ 3.0 and cmake continue to raise "g++ is too old"
@HeikoS	Guest55703: really?
@HeikoS	that should be a bug then
 Guest55703	cmake version is 4.8.3
@HeikoS	since we only need 4.4 or so
@HeikoS	cmake 4?
 Guest55703	and each time I have remove cmake cache
@HeikoS	2.8.2 you mean?
 wiking	Guest55703: what os?
 Guest55703	ubuntu
 wiking	Guest55703: ok try running cmake with -DENABLE_CCACHE=OFF
 Guest55703	sss
 Guest55703	nice it works
@HeikoS	wiking: I think I found a bug related to automated unit tests
@HeikoS	if jinja is not around there are these dummy tests
 wiking	HeikoS: that's already fixed
@HeikoS	and my compiler complains about the "." in the name
@HeikoS	".cc_dummy"
 wiking	HeikoS: 0d0f3eecfec68c0c09e8185f370d9092c4b4f253
@HeikoS	when was that fixed? just rebased
 Guest55703	-DENABLE_CCACHE=OFF resolves the cmake error
@HeikoS	ok
 wiking	HeikoS: wtf
 wiking	aaah i know
 Guest55703	I dont understand why anyway
 wiking	Guest55703: ubuntu feature
 wiking	HeikoS: ok i'll push the fix soon

@HeikoS	wiking: whats with this new coverage flag?
 wiking	HeikoS: not really working yet
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, another question. Are debug symbols included in "Release". Or anything else that could make code (eigen3) slow?
@HeikoS	since I am confused about its slow speed compared to cholmod
@HeikoS	(which I call from python)
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-409794.home.otenet.gr] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 wiking	HeikoS: -g only
@HeikoS	wiking: google seems to be confused about whether it makes things slower or not, do you have any idea about this?
@HeikoS	though  most people seem to reccomend it
 besser82	HeikoS: in production binaries / libraries should get stripped ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: so they don't ship any debug-symbols inside
@HeikoS	besser82: what I am interested in, could that make things slow
@HeikoS	in particular in eigen3 with our huge huge library
 besser82	HeikoS: yes, it can and will
 besser82	HeikoS: there's a command called `strip` which is able to strip the library, so it will just carry ELF not DWARF
 besser82	HeikoS: after stripping libshogun should be ~20 MByte ;)
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	any idea how to do that? :)
 besser82	HeikoS: strip -ps libshogun.so  ;)
@HeikoS	ok cool, good to know
 wiking	thoralf: ok so one question remains with your unit test... how to provide the proper path to data
@HeikoS	wiking: https://github.com/karlnapf/independent-jobs
@HeikoS	wiking: thats a draft for computation framework using PBS backends
@HeikoS	wiking: very basic, but I already used it for things
@HeikoS	most interface parts are taken from lambday's implementation in shogun
 wiking	cool
 wiking	will be great to include ref to it in 3.0 release
 thoralf	wiking: I know.  Forgot to say that I had to create a symlink to make it work.
 wiking	yeah i figured
 thoralf	wiking: There's no unit test using data.
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	thoralf: you could have done the same way as i did for StreamingDenseFeatures
 thoralf	wiking: Would it be possible that cmake defines the path and/or create a symlink?
 wiking	thoralf: no
 wiking	thoralf: unit tests are really not meant to read from data
 wiking	that's more like examples
 wiking	so either we put this little test under examples
 wiking	or generate the input ourselves
 thoralf	Since the test does not depend on the content of the file, we could easily create a dummy file on-the-file with tempfile
 thoralf	Only needs to have > 8 lines.
 wiking	thoralf: as i said i've done this with streamingdense
 thoralf	wiking: Yes.
 wiking	and i'll rename this test to streamingsparsefeatures test
 wiking	and move it under features
 thoralf	I don't mind.
 thoralf	You're test does almost the same.
 wiking	the question is how to generate
 thoralf	Your
 wiking	sparse features
 thoralf	print "0 1:1" 10 times? ;)
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	that's rather stupid
 thoralf	KISS :)
 wiking	i mean it would be better to be a bit more complex
 thoralf	I know.  But for now it would work.
 thoralf	Can extend is as soon as we need more.
 thoralf	On demand.
 thoralf	But I think saving sparse features is not hard either.
 thoralf	Didn't do it so far.
 thoralf	CSparseFeatures<sg_type>::save(CFile* writer)
 thoralf	Should be trivial.
 thoralf	I'll try.  Give me a second. :)
 wiking	yeah that works
 wiking	i'm just wondering what CFIle i should supply
 wiking	ok csvfile doesn't work
 wiking	maybe CLibSVMFile
 thoralf	AsciiFile is gone?
 wiking	thoralf: yes
 Guest55703	ah
 Guest55703	what if we want to save svm machine ?
 Guest55703	SerializableAsciiFile is still available right ?
 wiking	Guest55703: call save_serializable
 wiking	Guest55703: yes SerializableAsciiFile is available
 wiking	the two things are unrelated
 Guest55703	I ve notice SerializableAsciiFile takes sometimes long time to load, what alternative do we have ?
 wiking	Guest55703: hdf5
 wiking	Guest55703: it's binary format
 wiking	should be faster
 thoralf	wiking: LibSVMFile works.
 wiking	thoralf: yeah i've copy pasted something
 wiking	from libsvmfile unittest
* thoralf created a file with 10 empty lines and it worked well (i.e. generating a segfault)
 thoralf	wiking: We need something to create random sparse vectors.
 wiking	thoralf: libsvmfile_unittest.cc

@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, in CSVFile I guess?
 sonne|osx	no in general
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: similar how python does it with gzipfile
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, I see, so it could be possible to do stuff like CSVFile(InfamousFilter(gzippedFile))
@iglesiasg	but it could be use somewhere else too
 sonne|osx	sth like this yes

 besser82	sonne|osx: On el5 atlas' lapack doesn't provide all needed symbols
 besser82	sonne|osx: so we need to link against original LAPACK
 sonne|osx	wiking: any clues what we can do about the build failure on deb1? It seems the breakage occurred quite a while ago. I cannot even find the last working version in waterfall ...
 besser82	sonne|osx: but then there are some missing symbols, which are covered by CLAPACK, which is part of ATLAS
 sonne|osx	besser82: how do you know which one to use?
 besser82	sonne|osx: but CLAPACK isn't looked up by FindATLAS
 besser82	sonne|osx: so I need to use some regex magic
 besser82	sonne|osx: because CLAPACK is ALWAYS avail from ATLAS
 sonne|osx	besser82: I am just trying to understand what you do...

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: hey!
 lambday	I have a proposal
@HeikoS	lambday: tell me :)
 shogun-buildbot	build #2180 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2180  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 lambday	in the paper, they mentioned that for large condition number CG-M takes ages to converge... and the main motivation towards this approach is to be memory efficient for really massive matrices
 lambday	HeikoS: so, in the ipython demo, can I first use a really really massive matrix and show that this works, and then take ozone and show that for poor condition number convergence is really slow
 lambday	I mean, otherwise the main point would be missed
 lambday	I can use the small matrix, but I want to use a huge data for which cholesky would be just pathetic
 lambday	and show that for reasonable condition numbers, this indeed is a nice solution
@HeikoS	lambday: sorry what is the point and your plan?
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	yeah, the python notebooks should contain reasonable conditioned matrices
 lambday	also, ozone will show the drawbacks
@HeikoS	yeah, but that is part of the game
@HeikoS	you should definitely include it
 lambday	this west0479 is really small
 lambday	exactly
@HeikoS	just set the max iterations small and make a note that users can set larger to get more accurate results
 lambday	that's what I was thinking about
@HeikoS	sounds good
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah, but for quick convergence I want to use another matrix for which our method *does* work really nicely
@HeikoS	yes, include a massive matrix with nice condition number
 lambday	HeikoS: so should I randomly generate one?
@HeikoS	the west matrix is horribly conditioned, its an illustration that things even work then -- but take long
@HeikoS	there should be
 lambday	yes
@HeikoS	1.) small easy matrix
@HeikoS	2.) huge huge easy matrix
@HeikoS	3.) small hard matrix (west)
@HeikoS	4.) large hard matrix
@HeikoS	and maybe one that is huge and easy *and* real life data
 lambday	for large hard, I have ozone
 lambday	searching for huge but easy
@HeikoS	lambday: we can ask daniel for that and him whether he has some nice real life PSD matrix which is huge but well conditioned
@HeikoS	lambday: do you want to include the ozone likelihood in your notebook?
@HeikoS	and pictures?
@HeikoS	or rather focus on the matrices?
@HeikoS	lambday: you can also illustrate all those solvers in the notebook
 lambday	HeikoS: I wish I can, but I need to understand the estimates for that
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah already planned
 lambday	this is what I thought
 lambday	1. introduction - theoretical background, just a bit
@HeikoS	lambday: I mean you can motivate the usage
@HeikoS	you can use my code for the model
 lambday	2. linear solvers
@HeikoS	I can also share some plotting code
 lambday	3. logdet
@HeikoS	then there is a motivation
@HeikoS	you can also reference our arxiv paper and state that this is used in there
 wiking	sonne|work: ideas wtf is happening with buildbots?
 lambday	HeikoS: that would be great!
@HeikoS	including the RR would be too much though
@HeikoS	lambday: check my github account and ozone-roulette
@HeikoS	this contains code for computing the marginal likelihood for the ozone model
@HeikoS	and my poster contains the model itself and the log marginal likelihood
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	you can then say: "This can be used for performing exact MCMC on large models"
@HeikoS	and compute 1 estimate with low max iteration number ;)
@HeikoS	just need plotting code, but will send you :)
@HeikoS	then it will look very cool
 lambday	yeah :D
@HeikoS	lambday: btw try to be not tooo formal  but rather motivate things, why we want to do this etc
 lambday	alright..
@HeikoS	lambday: I think with all that and your other ideas, it will look awesome
 lambday	let's see... I am hopeful :)
@HeikoS	lambday: https://github.com/karlnapf/ozone-roulette
@HeikoS	lambday: btw I also have your computation framework running in python with a batch cluster backend https://github.com/karlnapf/independent-jobs
 lambday	HeikoS: awesome!
 lambday	HeikoS: when are we going to do this inside shogun? :D
@HeikoS	lambday: hopefully soon
@HeikoS	lambday: but too many other urgent things to do currently
 lambday	when is the 3.0 release?
@HeikoS	lambday: and there are some hacks in there that I dont know whether its possible to do them
@HeikoS	lambday: two weeks or so
@HeikoS	lambday: we will need your help :)
 lambday	the ipython notebook idea for end term is awesome by the way! really motivates the users
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, that will be really useful, the three I have seen so far are very cool, waiting for yours and romans
 lambday	HeikoS: hehe.. :D I'll try my best
@HeikoS	lambday: let me know if you need any tex stuff
@HeikoS	like poster sourcecode or so ....
 wiking	mmm we have a problem with r_modular + CScalarResult<>: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/11466773#L3055

 shogun-buildbot	build #2182 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2182
@HeikoS	wiking: I merged since this looked like ongoing R business to me, sorry
@HeikoS	wiking: also isnt R excluded?
 lambday	wiking: I am sorry I can't get a clue
@HeikoS	I though is was allowed to fail
 lambday	HeikoS: yes R is allowed failures :D
 wiking	it's allowed to fail
 wiking	as we have other issues
 besser82	wiking: where inside CMakeLists the libdir is set?
@HeikoS	wiking: is it really this patch that causes it?
 wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	or is it just this commit that discovered that there is a problem?
 wiking	if u step back in travis builds one build you'll see it's examples that fails
 lambday	HeikoS: it has issues since in this patch I added CScalarResult and CVectorResult etc..
 wiking	not the interface itself
 lambday	...to modular interface
 wiking	besser82: well the libshogun install 'path' is in src/shogun/CMakeLists.txt
 besser82	wiking: thx! will have a look on it ;)
 lambday	wiking: HeikoS: R uses some internal structure SEXPREC
 besser82	wiking: the ruby thing I already found and can change it with a sed-one-liner in spec-file ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: but thats an R issue isnt it?
 lambday	which is incomplete, don't know why
@HeikoS	I have no idea about this stuff
 lambday	neither do I
@HeikoS	why is it caused by these classes
 wiking	besser82: i'll add a test for LIB_INSTALL_DIR
@HeikoS	they are very simple
 wiking	besser82: if it's there then libshogun is going to be installed in LIB_INSTALL_DIR
 wiking	ok?
 besser82	wiking: that would be really nice of you :)
 besser82	wiking: for lua, too, then?

 besser82	wiking: yes :)
 besser82	wiking: LIB_SUFFIX might be useful there ;)
 wiking	besser82: i'll just use LIB_INSTALL_DIR
 wiking	and then just put there that into the regexp if it's set

 besser82	HeikoS. I know ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: I could get around this via exposing a triangular solver to the modular interfaces, but this seems not good
@HeikoS	since I cannot use any scipy stuff with shogun then
 besser82	HeikoS: Let me investigate and solve ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: can one merge two shared libs?
@HeikoS	then I can put that merged thing into my home and link against it
 besser82	HeikoS: that's not possible, unfortunately
@HeikoS	scipy seems to be picky and only accepts the atlas-lapack

@HeikoS	besser82: ok, what should I tell the guy?
@HeikoS	besser82: or can I install locally instead?

@HeikoS	or even virtual-env?

@HeikoS	besser82: can I install that even?
 besser82	HeikoS: no, but your admin should :)
@HeikoS	besser82: I dont think he likes that
@HeikoS	besser82: what about just virtual-enving a full python distribution?
 besser82	HeikoS: would be the other possibility
 besser82	HeikoS: but your admin can fetch my build from fedora-infrastructure ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: or just scipy
 besser82	HeikoS: possibly scipy might be enough
@HeikoS	mmmh dont know I dont like to interact since things take so long
 besser82	HeikoS: but let me check first for a simpler approach :)
@HeikoS	so try-error is annoying this way
 besser82	HeikoS: yes

@HeikoS	wiking: wow, were you doing that anyways=?
@HeikoS	ah
 besser82	HeikoS: just un-tar && go ;)
@HeikoS	so then I can just somehow open this and have everything there?
 wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	what about paths/libs dependencies etc?
 wiking	HeikoS: it's within that
@HeikoS	is it fully self-contained?
 wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	what does it need then?
 wiking	HeikoS: just pray that u dont have harsh quota-s on your home
@HeikoS	wiking: what about thinkgs like scipy?
@HeikoS	thats not needed for shogun
@HeikoS	and other software
@HeikoS	can one install things?

 wiking	HeikoS: what other sw woudl u need?
@HeikoS	wiking: let me check
@HeikoS	wiking: how about pulling/rebuilding shogun?
 wiking	if u need any other image let me know
 wiking	HeikoS: ?
 wiking	HeikoS: that's another story
 wiking	i'll prepare the image + a shogun in it
@HeikoS	wiking: like I make changes to the development branch
 wiking	yeah i know u want everything
 wiking	there'll be a shogun git repo in that image
@HeikoS	wiking: just asking ;)
 wiking	and u do with that whatever u want
 wiking	but in our case it'll be a nightly updated image
@HeikoS	what about git pull and makeing?
 wiking	since i want to mount that image with R-O mode
 wiking	i mean R/O mode
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	for security stuff
 wiking	yes
@HeikoS	wiking: ok that is not enough for me, sadly, maybe later once things are stable
 wiking	but then again u do whatever u want
 wiking	i mean u can do whatever with that image
 wiking	and modify it as u wish
@HeikoS	wiking: so I could mount rw and then git pull blabla
 wiking	and then just distrib that image around
 wiking	yes
 wiking	what u do with that image
 wiking	is really up to you
 wiking	the repo with a dev branch in it will be available
 wiking	and it'll have all the required packages
 wiking	apart from like mosek
@HeikoS	wiking: so also compiler etc?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	as it needs it for building
 wiking	i mean i'll rebuild the shogun in that image every night
 wiking	but you rebuild it whenever u want it
@HeikoS	wiking: hey man, that sounds too good to be true
 wiking	we have such image based on fedora 19
 wiking	out of box
@HeikoS	I already spent a week on getting all this shit to work
 wiking	so if u dont have a problem with fedora
 wiking	i can tar gz u that image :P
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont care at all about internals, just care about things working ;)
 wiking	HeikoS: it's 12 gigs
@HeikoS	wiking: thats fine
 wiking	HeikoS: but i'll try to make a slim one assap
 wiking	we can even distrib this image
 wiking	as like
 wiking	here u go
 wiking	have this as a VM image
@HeikoS	wiking: so how certain are you about tonight about this?
 wiking	and you have shogun out of box
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah very nice
 wiking	well i'll have a coffe now
 wiking	and i'll start
@HeikoS	wiking: ah there is a trick
@HeikoS	the cluster software
 wiking	what's with it?
@HeikoS	the SGE stuff
@HeikoS	can I still run commands like qsub?
 wiking	well
 wiking	is there a package for it?
 wiking	or that's some proprietary stuff?
@HeikoS	wiking: no since its all installed locally and I have no idea
 wiking	ok what is the cluster stuff u r using?
 wiking	but i mean man how the fuck is it possible that u have a cluster
 wiking	and the nodes are not the exact same distribs
@HeikoS	Sun stuff
@HeikoS	wiking: thats solved
 wiking	who to the hell maintains such cluster?
 wiking	where nodes are like 'whatever'
@HeikoS	I just want to install on my login node currently
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll start up a new image
@HeikoS	wiking: dude I dont know how can that be, I spend days over days on this shit, totally stresses me out
@HeikoS	all these weird problems
 wiking	yeah
@HeikoS	why the hell is that stupid symbol not in atlas-lapack
@HeikoS	I dont know
@HeikoS	why doesnt scipy work with the classic lapack
@HeikoS	I dont know
 wiking	hehe
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll give u a ping as soon as i'm ready
@HeikoS	wiking: cool cheers
 wiking	i'll try to find an ubuntu chroot image

 lambday	cond# for this one is ~100
 HeikoS1	lambday: this makes it almost a diagonal matrix
 HeikoS1	so maybe play with that a big
 lambday	yeah
 HeikoS1	lambday: what happened to the original matrix without AtA?
 lambday	trying with various combo
 lambday	HeikoS1: going to get tea (chai) :)
 HeikoS1	enjoy :)

@HeikoS	thanks besser82
 besser82	HeikoS: np :)
 lambday	HeikoS: added a ridge 100.0 to the original matrix, CG-M converges within 500 iterations
 lambday	tested with 1000.0, 10000.0 too, CG-M converged < 50 iterations
@HeikoS	lambday: ok that is good, you can add a comment in the notebook that you are doing this in order to make runtime reasonable

 wiking	shouldn't we start supporting this: http://www.openblas.net/?
@HeikoS	wiking: no we should stick with eigen3, which in fact calls blas internally quite often
@HeikoS	wiking: btw about the -g, eigen3 sometimes seems unreasonably slow, it might have to do with that, is it possible to add a strip option to cmake=?

 wiking	just exec strip libshogun.so...
@HeikoS	wiking: can I just do this on the installed one?
@HeikoS	I see
 besser82	HeikoS: yes, you can simply strip the installed one ;)
 besser82	wiking: but it would be nice if CMake would place the system's CFLAGS/LDFLAGS at the end of all used flags ;)

@sonney2k	besser82, libarchive sounds great!
 besser82	sonney2k: then I'm glad to have you helped-out :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: around?
 besser82	sonney2k: any idea why ctest doesn't respect PYTHONPATH?
 wiking	lisitsyn: yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: have you ever worked with detection of multiple parts?
 wiking	y
 besser82	sonney2k,wiking: any idea why ctest doesn't respect PYTHONPATH?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I know latent svm is the approach but I am out of time :(
 wiking	http://maeth.com/shogun-image.fs.sfs
 wiking	shogun prebuild squashfs
 besser82	wiking: any idea why ctest doesn't respect PYTHONPATH?
 lisitsyn	wiking: what have you used to learn the model, etc?
 wiking	lisitsyn: how many parts?
 wiking	lisitsyn: do u have the parts annotated?
 lisitsyn	wiking: 1+1 optional
 wiking	besser82: dunno
 besser82	wiking: kk
 lisitsyn	wiking: basically whether a payloader carries something
 wiking	lisitsyn: do u have annotation?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah I annotated a bit
 wiking	ok
 wiking	1+1 optional is really not much
 wiking	i mean 1 part is like no part
 lisitsyn	yeah totally simple
 lisitsyn	yes
 wiking	try the partbaseddetector
 wiking	do u have a matlab around?
 lisitsyn	nope
 wiking	lisitsyn: https://github.com/wg-perception/PartsBasedDetector
 wiking	but the training part is matlab
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok thanks
 wiking	where should we put a link for this squashfs
 wiking	?
 lisitsyn	no clue :)
