 n4nd0	hi blackburn
 blackburn	hey
 n4nd0	I saw the tests broke with the additions I did yesterday :(
 n4nd0	do you know what should be added?
 blackburn	what is failing?
 n4nd0	or is it caused only because it is the first time those tests were added?
 n4nd0	http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/497/steps/test%20libshogun/logs/stdio
 n4nd0	compile errors
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	io/ -> io/streaming
 n4nd0	yeah I noticed that right now
 blackburn	could you fix that?
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	but I don't understand how is it that it was working yesterday in my pc
 n4nd0	io/ -> io/streaming was done a month ago
 blackburn	not in includes of these examples
 n4nd0	yeah that's why I wondered how is it that it was compiling properly yesterday for me

 n4nd0	it is pretty weird I think
 n4nd0	blackburn: any idea why can it be that the compilation was ok in my pc?
 blackburn	the only thing I can think of is that you had headers in /io still
 n4nd0	no sign of streaming files there
 blackburn	no idea :)
 n4nd0	there you go
 n4nd0	I hope that fix the problems

@sonney2k	hmmhh no one here?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, hi
@sonney2k	gsomix_, hey :)
@sonney2k	gsomix_, do you know what the state is?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, how are you
 gsomix_	sonney2k, nope
@sonney2k	what are you working on?
@sonney2k	(if you are :)
 gsomix_	sonney2k, hm, at now I'm resting. :)
 gsomix_	is there some urgent work?
@sonney2k	gsomix_, last time I checked lots of examples in libshogun had memory leaks
@sonney2k	so yes :)
 gsomix_	ok
@sonney2k	gsomix_, did I read correctly? nu pogodi is no longer in TV before 23hrs?
 gsomix_	ahah, yep. one of the characters 'nu pogodi' smokes on TV. :)
 gsomix_	http://gorod48.ru/upload/iblock/355/35548bec76b9d4013e2fd7d1f821836c.jpg
 gsomix_	too bad :D
@sonney2k	I love this series
@sonney2k	gsomix_, when I was a kid I was watching lots and lots of nu pogodi
 gsomix_	I'm too
 gsomix_	I think people from TV can mark 'nu pogodi' as "cultural heritage" and show it in prime-time.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I still need bern4rd... but in the evening when I am here too :D
