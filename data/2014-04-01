 lambday	HeikoS: lisitsyn: wiking: around?
 lisitsyn	lambday: jawohl!
 lambday	lisitsyn: I don't know what that is :D
 lisitsyn	lambday: sir yes sir!
 lisitsyn	:D
 lambday	lisitsyn: lol :D... hey did you happen to notice the dot interface on that thread after that?
 lambday	lisitsyn: does it look something we should go for?
 lisitsyn	oh sorry I wasn't following it
 lisitsyn	let me check
 lambday	lisitsyn: please we desparately need your opinion :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: I thought keeping the vector templated will later allow us to deal with other vector storage we might wanna have for GPU vectors..
 lambday	so things can be done using the same interface everywhere
 lisitsyn	how?
 lisitsyn	https://gist.github.com/lambday/9827450
 lambday	and different backends for eigen solvers can also be used this way
 lisitsyn	is that the right snippet to look at?
 lambday	let me see
 lambday	lisitsyn: yes that one
 lisitsyn	lambday: I don't get it yet
 lisitsyn	what's new here?
 lisitsyn	or
 lisitsyn	how do we handle gpu vectors?
-!- lambday_ [67157d54@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.84] has joined #shogun
 lambday_	lisitsyn: sorry got dc
 lisitsyn	lambday_: I don't get how to handle gpu vectors yet
 lambday_	lisitsyn: well, we have this template <class T, class Vector>
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lambday_	VectorDotOperator
 lisitsyn	got it
 lambday_	we don't have any wrappers for gpu vectors *yet* but soon we'll be needing that
 lisitsyn	that's pretty smart yeah
 lambday_	ViennaCL::vector, say
 lambday_	lisitsyn: so does it seem like something we should go for?
 lisitsyn	yeah I see nothing wrong yet
 lambday_	lisitsyn: I mean it looks neat but not sure if its overkill...
-!- lambday [67157d54@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.84] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 lisitsyn	well if it is not overkill performance wise
 lisitsyn	then it should be ok ;)
 lisitsyn	I mean more flexibility won't hurt
 lambday_	lisitsyn: I don't it would be... more compile time, yeah, but runtime wise no overhead
 lambday_	lisitsyn: and what's your opinion on putting this whole thing under linear operator interface?
 lambday_	like the way this gist does
 lisitsyn	that looks ok as well
 lambday_	cool!
 lambday_	so +1 from your side :D
 lisitsyn	yeah I see nothing wrong yet
 lambday_	great!
 lambday_	that guy already sent a patch
 lisitsyn	but I'd need to think more
 lambday_	claims to have all the existing tests working...
 lisitsyn	if we are on the right path ;)
 lambday_	lisitsyn: absolutely
 lisitsyn	but well
 lisitsyn	more action is better right?
 lisitsyn	;)
 lambday_	more action on?
 lisitsyn	I mean we had no one working on that
 lisitsyn	so any kind of trials is good
 lambday_	I think :)
 lambday_	so once that patch is merged, we can push that guy a bit to work on the interface for dot product next
