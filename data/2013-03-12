 sonne|work	blackburn: I am still undecided...
 blackburn	sonne|work: a nice feature anyway
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes indeed... I am already used to that from eclipse btw
 blackburn	sonne|work: have you heard hinton is joining google?
 sonne|work	interesting. I guess he wants to create google brain(tm)
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah infinitely deep network
 sonne|work	a c'mon a few million layers should be enough for everybody :)

 blackburn	as a hipster teenager I should tweet that

 blackburn	heiko: okay that MDS thing must be changed
 heiko	blackburn: ok will do tonight
 blackburn	heiko: I will :)
 heiko	blackburn:  just dicovered the coolness of Eigen3 :)
 blackburn	heiko: hah congraatz
 heiko	(compared to boost lina classes :)
 blackburn	heiko: that's kind of late discover :)
 heiko	blackburn:  well so far I did not need it
 heiko	c++ array were sufficient
 blackburn	heiko: explicit SSE is somewhat important speedup I think
 heiko	what is that?
 blackburn	heiko: when you compute norm your CPU can handle two doubles per op
 heiko	blackburn:  I see, thats good stuff
 blackburn	heiko: eigen does all vectorization explicitly (when compiler can be afraid of doing that)
 heiko	blackburn: what does that mean vectorization?
 blackburn	heiko: SIMD (single instruction multiple data), i.e. SSE
 blackburn	heiko: (at least SSE)
 heiko	blackburn: I see
 heiko	cool
 heiko	good stuff! :)
 blackburn	heiko: some more magic of eigen is in template expression though
 heiko	yeah this is what I meant
 heiko	this is really cool and seems flexible
 blackburn	heiko: a = b + c + d; means no copy
 blackburn	as operator+ returns some thing that can be added to other vector and finally it is evaluated to a[i] = b[i] + c[i] + d[i] (but vectorized)
 n4nd0	do you guys know if // means something special in python? I have found it in some code as an operator between two integers
 n4nd0	I have seen it does the same as / for simple cases
 n4nd0	i.e. integer division
 heiko	n4nd0: no idea :)
 heiko	n4nd0: but python has strange operators sometimes x**2 for example
 heiko	to I guess // is related to that
 blackburn	n4nd0:    3//1 => 3
 n4nd0	floor division!
 blackburn	ha
 blackburn	   3//2.0 => 1.0
 blackburn	n4nd0: ^
 n4nd0	I see, thanks!
 n4nd0	so actually if both of them are integers, it doesn't make any difference wrt using /
 n4nd0	more explicit though
 blackburn	heiko: I took a look at your statistics code - pretty well organized
 heiko	blackburn:  thanks :) what did you look at in particular?
 blackburn	heiko: glanced over classes
 heiko	linear time mmd is the best one ! :)
 blackburn	heiko: pretty big
 heiko	yes, it does a lot of things
 heiko	remember: it can handle infinite amounts of data
 heiko	(and do automatic optimal kernel selection for that)
 blackburn	heiko: I still do not understand how to use it but that's nice
 heiko	blackburn: on streams
 heiko	changepoint detection for example
 heiko	but to be honest, it is not that widely used :)
 blackburn	heiko: what is changepoint detection?
 heiko	you have a stream of data and want to know when it changes
 heiko	so imagine a brain-scanner
 heiko	and you change your thought :)
 heiko	(roughly)
 heiko	test whether a distribution changes
 blackburn	heiko: what would I need to pass to that algorithm?
 heiko	first one needs a change point detection algo
 heiko	the MMD does the following
 heiko	you pass samples from two distributions p and q
 heiko	and it tells you whether p!=q
 blackburn	but how is that changepoint?
 heiko	you can also use that to select kernels for classification since it will tell you which kernel maximises the difference
 heiko	blackburn: you have to embed it into other things
 heiko	there is a paper somewhere
 heiko	how to do that
 heiko	you have like groups and test one against others
 blackburn	heiko: so I first collect some normal data?
 blackburn	heiko: I see some 'business' case
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	imagine I have a website
 blackburn	and collect visitors data
 blackburn	that's P
 blackburn	and then I change something in my adverstisement and collect more data
 blackburn	that's Q
 heiko	yep thats a thing you could do
 blackburn	so I define some kernel on visiting data and check if distribution of P and Q
 blackburn	are equal
 blackburn	quite interesting
 heiko	blackburn:  yeah its a bit like classification
 blackburn	heiko: I was recently asked about possible way to solve similar problem
 blackburn	heiko: but P>Q
 heiko	but more the qeustion: are there differences
 heiko	you mean number of samples?
 blackburn	heiko: not really
 blackburn	heiko: not correct formulation though :)
 blackburn	heiko: guy needed to check if site with # of clicks P has more efficient adv than site with # of clicks Q
 blackburn	or so
 blackburn	heiko: he actually had only means so I said that's quite impossible if you just have means
 heiko	thats quite little information :)
 blackburn	as he needed to do that with 0.95 confidence heh
 blackburn	no way to compute anything with confidence without probability distribution I guess
 blackburn	or at least variance..
 heiko	you need samples then you can do that
 blackburn	heiko: I am actually unsure what is sample here
 blackburn	# of clicks per some period may be

 sonne|work	blackburn: you seem to be so very excited about sse stuff in eigen - note that the standard gcc compiler will vectorize your simple for loops too so no need to be overly excited
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am actually more excited about it gives you an API to do that stuff
 sonne|work	yeah that is the benefit of it
 blackburn	sonne|work: good code contains almost no loops
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is not true sometimes - gcc don't care about aliasing
-!- heiko [~heiko@nat-168-237.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: so it could fail with that
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am really unsure if gcc will be able to SIMDize some function which takes double* as a parameter
 sonne|work	I would bet so
 blackburn	sonne|work: anyway you can't say it does that in all cases that eigen does
 blackburn	sonne|work: for example ICC vectorization is known to be more powerful (so there is a room)

 tom____	hi!
 tom____	I would like to use the sosvm framework in shogun
 tom____	Is there any example of usage with sequential data ?
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@78.129.244.119] has quit [Quit: This computer has gone to sleep]
 n4nd0	hey tom____ !
 n4nd0	nice to hear you want to use the sosvm framework :)
 tom____	n4nd0: hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	tom____: take a look to examples so_hmsvm_mosek.cpp and so_hmsvm_mosek_simple.cpp in examples/undocumented/libshogun
 tom____	n4nd0: then mosek need to be installed ?
 n4nd0	tom____: and for the python interface, structure_hmsvm_*
 n4nd0	tom____: not really
 n4nd0	there is a solver that makes use of mosek
 n4nd0	for the examples with mosek in the name you need it
 n4nd0	but we have also some bundle methods implemented
 n4nd0	look for example structure_hmsvm_bmrm.py in examples/undocumented/python_modular
 n4nd0	sorry for the misleading name so_ in some of them - I will rename those to structure_
 tom____	n4nd0: ok thank you
 n4nd0	tom____: no problem
 tom____	n4nd0: I use most of the time c++ then I will take a lokk to CDualLibQPBMSOSVM
 tom____	that's the bundle isn't it ?
 n4nd0	tom____: yeah

 n4nd0	tom____: there are also examples using the bundle method in the C++ interface
 n4nd0	tom____: examples/undocumented/libshogun/so_multiclass_BMRM.cpp
 n4nd0	that's not dealing with sequential data
 n4nd0	but for that part you can always check the other examples
 tom____	such ?
 n4nd0	the ones I mentioned before
 n4nd0	e.g. so_hmsvm_mosek
 n4nd0	you can exchange models and solvers as you wish
 n4nd0	so if you are interested in the bundle methods -> check things with bmrm
 n4nd0	if you are interested in sequential data -> things with hmsvm
 n4nd0	tom____: see what I mean?
 tom____	n4nd0: allright
 tom____	n4nd0: thank you

 n4nd0	blackburn: nice
 blackburn	n4nd0: about results
 blackburn	(in paper)
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think I've got to try to optimize it
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is the part that concerns you?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd like to show >3x speedup always (that's the reason to parallelize code)
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am surprised with speed of lle
 blackburn	in drtoolbox
 blackburn	n4nd0: 8 CPUs? really?
 n4nd0	blackburn: that's what /proc/cpuinfo tells me
 n4nd0	I can paste it if you want to check
 blackburn	yeah could you please
 blackburn	I'd rather expect 2 cpus with 4 cores
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/GTVJNDwk
 n4nd0	blackburn: well it may be
 n4nd0	I have an i7 here
 n4nd0	an proc/cpuinfo shows me 4 processors
 blackburn	n4nd0: does it happen to have intel compiler around?
 n4nd0	blackburn: how can I check that?
 blackburn	n4nd0: X3470 is 4 core
 blackburn	n4nd0: 'icpc' may be
 n4nd0	comman not found
 n4nd0	command*
 blackburn	may be anything in /opt/intel?
 n4nd0	no directory
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm alright
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is ubuntu version?
 n4nd0	Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
 n4nd0	precise pangolin IIRC
 blackburn	n4nd0: and matlab 2011a, right?
 n4nd0	yep
 blackburn	alright thanks
 n4nd0	blackburn: a pleasure :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: so how can we speed it up?

 n4nd0	blackburn: what?
 n4nd0	blackburn: ah sorry yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: python benchmark.py scaling
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's do it
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am curious what is $\infty$
 blackburn	I'd avoid offensive claims that waffles didn't finish in 10 hours
 n4nd0	Tapkee parallel implementations benchmark
 n4nd0	Isomap on Swissroll with 1 threads takes 17.2111s
 n4nd0	Isomap on Swissroll with 2 threads takes 9.5318s
 n4nd0	Isomap on Swissroll with 3 threads takes 6.8726s
 n4nd0	Isomap on Swissroll with 4 threads takes 5.5947s
 n4nd0	Isomap on Swissroll with 5 threads takes 5.5965s
 blackburn	but it is true in the end..
 n4nd0	blackburn: well it was not 10 hours
 n4nd0	blackburn: or yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't actually remember it
 blackburn	n4nd0: alright lets say 3
 n4nd0	mmm yeah yeah
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	it was 500 almost 600 minutes
 blackburn	n4nd0: 100 dense matrix-vector products..
 n4nd0	for each iteration
 n4nd0	cannot be good no
 blackburn	no I was wrong
 blackburn	for each dimension of target dimensions
 n4nd0	so then it is even more than 100??
 blackburn	I got a little lame
 blackburn	n4nd0: 200 totally to be more precise
 n4nd0	ah ok
 n4nd0	isn't it a bit weird that it was taking that much then?
 blackburn	n4nd0: but that should be computed faster than in 10 hours
 blackburn	so I expect some even more high performance stuff is here too
 blackburn	may be he just waits I don't know
 blackburn	Thread.sleep
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/aBvzbcYh
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm I see
 blackburn	thnaks
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'd start review of the paper
 n4nd0	blackburn: our or waffles?
 blackburn	n4nd0: haha our
 n4nd0	I guess you mean ours
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: so should we revise the paper again and decide to send it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I thought we had already reviewed it :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: just after plots and website
 n4nd0	the review or the send?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, I mean we should read it carefully, meanwhile finishing website and some nice plots
 blackburn	and then send
 n4nd0	blackburn: agree
 n4nd0	blackburn: did Chris contact you about something?
 blackburn	and we should release shogun
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, I guess he is busy
 n4nd0	and end with starvation in the world
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw do you think people should stop funding africa?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn: wtf?
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	it is a delicate thing
 blackburn	n4nd0: well countries spend a lot of money for nothing
 n4nd0	nothing?
 n4nd0	ha!
 n4nd0	there are lot of governors there getting rich man
 n4nd0	and what about the organizations who ask for the money?
 blackburn	yeah that's the only thing they sponsor
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	delicate... I remembered this
 n4nd0	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeGChOUqQuk
 n4nd0	I couldn't stop listening this song for some years ago
 blackburn	I know it is not really tolerant but I'd say it is not possible to pay them for not fcking all around the africa and spread aids
 blackburn	it is a matter of culture or so
 blackburn	n4nd0: I have heard that song back in time
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is a hard truth
 n4nd0	blackburn: it was in a episode of House
 n4nd0	maybe you heard it there
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh then I know
 blackburn	there were similar songs in
 blackburn	oh let me find english name for these series
 blackburn	ahhhhh remembered
 blackburn	scrubs
 n4nd0	hehe, that's about doctors too
