-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n158-p227.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: thanks for issuing a PR
 blackburn	is everything fixed now?
 n4nd0	no, not everything yet
 n4nd0	I am working in the LLTSA errors now
 n4nd0	I tried with the usual path, setting m_nullspace_shift but it didn't solve it
 blackburn	hmm
 n4nd0	I tried also a couple of things more but didn't succeed
 n4nd0	I will look to it now :)
 blackburn	if you have some time for that
 blackburn	I'd appreciate
 n4nd0	mmm SGVectorTest failed
 n4nd0	blackburn: btw I was thinking yesterday
 n4nd0	it could be good if we think of a small set of tasks
 n4nd0	and write them down somewhere
 blackburn	yeah..
 blackburn	n4nd0: github issues
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes, it is a good idea to write them there
 blackburn	n4nd0: I added 'entrance' label
 blackburn	if you have any ideas please put it
 n4nd0	will do, thank you!
 n4nd0	blackburn: why is it that lltsa needs the features to be set both in parameters.kernel and parameters.features?
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/converter/LinearLocalTangentSpaceAlignment.cpp#L41
 blackburn	n4nd0: it uses both kernel and feature access callbacks
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	n4nd0: so I asked for help in the ML
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, just read it
 n4nd0	that's nice, let's see if we get more suggestions
 blackburn	n4nd0: 3 already! :)
 n4nd0	:)
 lambday	hello, this is soumyajit. I want to get involved with shogun.. I've already cloned the source code and built it.. (cmdline static and python interfaces).. But I am not sure how to get started with such a huge codebase.. could you please suggest me something?
 n4nd0	lambday: you have come in a good moment :)
 lambday	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn has just created an entrance section on github issues
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?labels=entrance&page=1&state=open
 lambday	okay. i'm checking..
 n4nd0	it was announced in the mailing list a few minutes ago too
-!- proKrammer [73fe7104@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.254.113.4] has joined #shogun
 lambday	okay.. I'm not yet registered to the mailing list.. will do
 lambday	and also, is there any kernel related development task currently within the scope? I'm doing some reading on string kernels and I'm really interested to work with one
 n4nd0	lambday: you could check if we already have implemented that kernel
 n4nd0	if it is not, you are welcome to include it
 n4nd0	lambday: see src/shogun/kernel/string
 lambday	n4nd0: thanks.. I'm checking
 n4nd0	what kernel is it btw the one you are interested to work with?
 lambday	n4nd0: well, I was reading this paper "Fast Kernels for String and Tree matching" by Vishwanathan et al. as a part of my coursework
 lambday	http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips15/AA11.pdf
 blackburn	I'd recommend Soeren's thesis http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/publications/Son08.pdf
 n4nd0	blackburn: everything in there is probably already in shogun though
 n4nd0	I am not sure, just guessing
 lambday	blackburn: are these the kernels that are already implemented in shogun?
 blackburn	lambday: I think so
 lambday	oh I see the subsequence kernel
 lambday	but it implemented the paper by lodhi..
 lambday	blackburn: well, can you suggest me something then, any development related ideas (better if kernel related).. I'll do some reading and will be in touch...
 lambday	and also, how should I go about understanding the architecture of shogun?
 blackburn	lambday: we are now collecting ideas https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?labels=entrance&state=open
 blackburn	there should be some kernel related for sure - we just started
 n4nd0	lambday: get to know the code superficially, browse different classes and so on
 lambday	blackburn: okay.. thanks :)
 blackburn	it is a difficult question about architecture - I have nothing general about that
 lambday	n4nd0: alright.. I'll keep in touch.. meanwhile, I'll go through the thesis by Soeren
 n4nd0	wiking: haha ok ok
 n4nd0	I don't think that in this case to compile with -lpthread -pthread would make a mistake anyway
 n4nd0	wiking: who can take a look to configure script?
 wiking	n4nd0: i did now... it's a bit problematic
 wiking	i mean the configure script for -pthread or -lpthread is quite easy
 wiking	the problem is more about that i actually do not understand
 wiking	why -pthread is not working for unit test compilation
 n4nd0	yeah, I reckon that feeling when looking at configure :)
 wiking	but works fine for libshogun
 sonne|work	n4nd0: regarding this list - is LDA multiclass already?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: LDA multiclass and change QDA to eigen were in my head
 n4nd0	I am going to write them soon
 wiking	mmm
 n4nd0	in the entrance issues I mean
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes please thx
 wiking	n4nd0: what is the exact compilation that does not work for you for unit test?
 n4nd0	wiking: give me a couple of minutes to check
 wiking	n4nd0: ok
 n4nd0	sonne|work: did you talk with c-base people?
 n4nd0	I don't exactly recall when was the exact
 n4nd0	around 15 IIRC
 n4nd0	exact date*
 blackburn	14 I think
 blackburn	love meeting
 blackburn	lol
 n4nd0	haha yeah
 sonne|work	14th but it looks like I don't have time that evening :/
 sonne|work	and gunnar == /dev/null
 n4nd0	:(
 n4nd0	wiking: https://gist.github.com/iglesias/4943650
 wiking	ah shit the linking line is actually not there :(
 wiking	n4nd0: can u edit the Makefile under tests/unit
 wiking	and there at line 28
 n4nd0	wiking: sure
 wiking	remove the @ in front of @$(LINK)
 n4nd0	it seems that sonne|work has found an answer though hehe
 wiking	n4nd0: so just remove that @
 wiking	and do make again
 wiking	and copy paste the linking line
 wiking	the last c++ line
 wiking	sonne|work: afaik there's a better fix i just need to see the linking line
 wiking	i think the order of -pthread matters
 proKrammer	hi n4nd0 , I have spoken to you yesterday regarding the installation, i am done with it, but what about the GUI part?
 sonne|work	wiking: true
 wiking	n4nd0: u have it?
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	c++ -o shogun-unit-test ./classifier/svm/SVMOcas_unittest.cc.o ./multiclass/MulticlassOCAS_unittest.cc.o ./base/main_unittest.cc.o ./latent/LatentSVM_unittest.cc.o ./lib/SGVector_unittest.cc.o -Xlinker --no-undefined -L../../src/shogun -lshogun libgmock.a
 n4nd0	/usr/bin/ld: libgmock.a(gtest-all.o): undefined reference to symbol 'pthread_key_delete@@GLIBC_2.2.5'
 wiking	ok
 n4nd0	/usr/bin/ld: note: 'pthread_key_delete@@GLIBC_2.2.5' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 so try adding it to the linker command line
 n4nd0	/usr/lib/libpthread.so.0: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
 n4nd0	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
 n4nd0	make: *** [shogun-unit-test] Error
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	i wonder why there's no pthread there
 wiking	ok just a sec
 wiking	sonne|work: shouldn't $(LINKFLAGS) contain -pthread?
 wiking	sonne|work: POSTLINKFLAGS
 wiking	that should be it?!
 wiking	n4nd0: can u add to that line 28 this variable
 wiking	$(POSTLINKFLAGS)
 wiking	$(LINK) -o shogun-unit-test $(TESTOBJFILES) $(LINKFLAGS) -L$(SHOGUNSRCTOP)/shogun -lshogun libgmock.a $(LINKFLAGS_GMOCK) $(POSTLINKFLAGS)
 wiking	so it should look like something like this ^
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	and run make again
 wiking	and paste here the c++ line
 n4nd0	wiking: that made it
 wiking	ok how does the line look like?
 n4nd0	c++ -o shogun-unit-test ./classifier/svm/SVMOcas_unittest.cc.o ./multiclass/MulticlassOCAS_unittest.cc.o ./base/main_unittest.cc.o ./latent/LatentSVM_unittest.cc.o ./lib/SGVector_unittest.cc.o -Xlinker --no-undefined -L../../src/shogun -lshogun libgmock.a  -lm -pthread -ljson  -lxml2  -llapack -lcblas -larpack -lz -lbz2 -llzma
 wiking	ok
 n4nd0	-pthread is in da house now
 wiking	and it did not complain?
 n4nd0	no
 wiking	ran fine?
 n4nd0	yeah
 wiking	cool
 n4nd0	all tests passed
 wiking	commit and PR it
 n4nd0	just a few warnings
 wiking	i'll merge it
 wiking	that's ok that's because of MOCK
 n4nd0	should I put back the @ in front of @(LINK)?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	plz
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	compiling again with @ to ensure
 wiking	yeah that just silences the compile line
 wiking	so that it doesn't get printed on stdout
 n4nd0	aham
 wiking	but should work fine still
 n4nd0	yeah it did
 wiking	ok commit + pr :>
 wiking	plz
 n4nd0	wiking: the pull request is a bit ugly because of the previous commit and pull request I had issued :S
 n4nd0	wiking: take a look
 n4nd0	three commits in there
 wiking	aah yeah ok
 wiking	i got it why :)
 n4nd0	was there any way to fix that
 n4nd0	?
 wiking	can u do --amend?
 n4nd0	I should always work from a branch
 wiking	git commit --amend .
 n4nd0	it was already pushed in my repo, since I did the PR
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	true
 n4nd0	git commit --amend would make a problem?
 wiking	i think then it would break your branch
 wiking	:))))
 wiking	but that's ok we can merge it like this no sonne|work ?
 wiking	i mean yeah 3 commits for 1 fix but still it's workng :>

 sonne|work	why 3 commits not one?
 n4nd0	wiking: thank you for finding out the error :)
 wiking	nw
 wiking	sonne|work: see ^
 n4nd0	sonne|work: becuase of the previous PR with one commit
 n4nd0	I did that from master :S
 n4nd0	I shouldn't have done it, my bad
 sonne|work	n4nd0, wiking now please get shogun in release shape and we are good
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am currently taking a look to converter errors detected by valgrind
 sonne|work	thanks
 blackburn	fixing my mistakes hah
 shogun-buildbot_	build #807 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/807  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	well you are actually telling me where the errors are most of the time :D
 wiking	why did u faaaail
 wiking	ah ok
 n4nd0	wiking: I think the test was already broken before
 wiking	SGVectorTest.misc failed
 n4nd0	yeah
 wiking	ok yeah we need to use EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ :>
 blackburn	wiking: if you want to get more tests for shogun and have ideas - please add them to 'entrance' issues at github
 wiking	blackburn: oh good idea!
 blackburn	but it would need to describe what exactly to test
 shogun-buildbot_	build #808 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/808  blamelist: Viktor Gal <vigsterkr@gmail.com>, iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 blackburn	our candidates could get stucked with concepts that are well-known for us
 blackburn	that's probably normal but we should keep that in mind :)
 wiking	blackburn: yeah i'll try to make a module list and put them up one by one
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey
 n4nd0	maybe this makes sense to you
 n4nd0	in lltsa to set parameters.eigenshift equal to m_nullspace_shift (default -1e-9)
 n4nd0	gives more valgrind errors thatn
 n4nd0	to set it to m_reconstruction_shift (default 1e-3)

 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	I will look at it again later today or tom
 blackburn	I hope I can take a look tonight
 n4nd0	ok
 sonne|work	wiking: urgs -have you seen the ocas test failing?
 wiking	sonne|work: noup
 wiking	sonne|work: where?
 sonne|work	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/808/steps/test/logs/stdio
 sonne|work	wiking: don't you get the buildbot emails ?
-!- proKrammer [73fe7104@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.254.113.4] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 wiking	i do but not always i check them ;P
 wiking	uff
 wiking	sonne|work: i reckon there's some problem there with an SGVector function
 wiking	sonne|work: since we had the exact same errors when the ::max was bogus
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea but please check. if we don't address the issues tests are useless...
 wiking	sonne|work: working on it
 blackburn	7 entrance tasks so far!
 wiking	sonne|work: btw what is the proper method of right away applying patches of mine into shogun? or do i should go still with the commit local repot -> pr -> merge ?
 n4nd0	blackburn: we need now 7 students! hehe
 wiking	blackburn: ^
 blackburn	wiking: my position is that for small changes/bugfixes it is ok to commit directly
 wiking	blackburn: how?
 blackburn	wiking: hmm you can't?
 wiking	blackburn: no i dont know how :)
 blackburn	wiking: I think you need to change remote
 blackburn	to git@github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah that is best, but merge yourself
 blackburn	you probably have git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sonne|work	wiking: I will switch to doing that too
 blackburn	as a remote
 sonne|work	don't directly work on shogun master
 blackburn	I do not think we should do PRs for every change we make
 sonne|work	blackburn: and I do :)
 wiking	mm this is interesting
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/807/steps/test/logs/stdio
 wiking	sonne|work: any ideas ^
 sonne|work	but we had that discussion already.
 wiking	we use EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ in both cases
 wiking	but still it complains
 blackburn	sonne|work: you know once I get POWER and AUTHORITY..
 sonne|work	wiking: then maybe we need a slightly higher epsilon
 sonne|work	float stuff is certainly scary
 sonne|work	blackburn: you will I am sure but it is better that everyone's damage to the code might be looked at
 blackburn	sonne|work: well we actually should not work in master branch
 blackburn	I do not feel the difference between one commit + PR and one commit
 blackburn	both can be looked at
 blackburn	and the damage is done
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah dev branches might be a good idea
 sonne|work	once we have a release we should attempt to switch
 wiking	lolface
 wiking	fucking google test blog answers the same shit
 n4nd0	wiking: link?
 wiking	http://googletesting.blogspot.hu/2008/10/tott-floating-point-comparison.html
 wiking	sonne|work: can u enable unit testing on freebsd bot plz?
 wiking	sonne|work: ah ok it is
 wiking	sorry
 sonne|work	wiking: so why not use say 1e-12 as precision?
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	sonne|work: no i was wrong
 wiking	what is interesting though
 wiking	that the same bot
 wiking	has some weird things
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/807/steps/test/logs/stdio
 wiking	so there the SGVector.misc fails
 wiking	but then in the next build
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/808/steps/test/logs/stdio
 wiking	it is all good
 wiking	but the multiocas fails
 wiking	can we force a new build on this bot
 wiking	just out of curiosity
 sonne|work	wiking: sure just do it
 wiking	sonne|work: what is the command? :D
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess it is due to parallelization...
 wiking	shogun-buildbot_: force build deb1
 sonne|work	shogun-buildbot_: force build "deb1 - libshogun"
 shogun-buildbot_	no such builder 'deb1'
 shogun-buildbot_	build forced [ETA 1m27s]
 shogun-buildbot_	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 wiking	almost :)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #809 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/809
 wiking	hohoho
 wiking	this is mega insteresting
 wiking	as now it succeeded
 sonne|work	^
 sonne|work	(02:28:20 PM) sonne|work: wiking: I guess it is due to parallelization...
 wiking	yeps seems so

-!- FSCV [~FSCV@204.45.110.163] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: so then just limit it to use a single core
 n4nd0	sonne|work, wiking : why does parallelization make it fail?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: not sure if it fails or just finds some other valid solution (given objective w/i epsilon)
 wiking	lol now i have a failure with:
 wiking	Value of: SGVector<float64_t>::arg_max_abs(a.vector, 1, a.vlen, __null) Actual: 0
 wiking	Expected: arg_max_abs
 wiking	Which is: 9
 wiking	same with max_abs
 sonne|work	wiking: valgrind....
 wiking	ok i see why
 wiking	:))0
 wiking	it's an actual bug indeed

 wiking	mmm
 wiking	seems 1 thread did not help
 wiking	:(
 sonne|work	wiking: no longer working with github :/
 wiking	really? :) i guess then it's a bug of github that we should report

 tom__	hi!
 sonne|work	wiking: or they shoudl just install irker on their side...

 tom__	Quesion about saving/loading mklmachine : I use 'CSerializableAsciiFile' but when loaded from file, mkl->getsubkernelweights() return 0. Is there code sample for that ?
 sonne|work	tom__: please give us a minimal example to reproduce
 sonne|work	then we can create a test out of this and fix it!
 tom__	sonne|work: ok
 tom__	sonne|work: here it is http://pastebin.com/ZZKNRzqj

 sonne|work	just save the core mklmachine
 sonne|work	then all kernels/labels/features/parameters *should* be saved too
 sonne|work	if not -> bug
 tom__	that's what I am doing in the example I gave you. it is c++, maybe I misunderstood smthg
 tom__	how to access to combined kernel and weights from mkl pointer ?
 sonne|work	for example the multiclass classifier for the hand written digit recognition is stored exactly like that (the one from here http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/samples/ )
 sonne|work	tom__: gtg now might have a look later
 sonne|work	cu
 tom__	ok thx anyway i wil lokk into samples

 blackburn	heiko1: really?
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	NP-hard graph colouring?
 heiko1	blackburn, greedy version allowed :)
 heiko1	blackburn, updated
 blackburn	heiko1: what do you need it for btw?
 heiko1	just need *a* graph colouring
 heiko1	for estimating the trace of a matrix
 heiko1	as
 heiko1	 tr A = E_s [s^T A s] where s is a random variable with zero mean and identity covariance
 heiko1	the distribution of s determines the variance of this estimator
 heiko1	and there is a clever way to choose it
 heiko1	based on a graph colouring of the matrix
 blackburn	interesting
 heiko1	blackburn, its a bit weird, but gives really cool results
 heiko1	Google Hutchison estimator for the basic ideas
 heiko1	(without graph colouring)
 blackburn	okay anyway I don't mind :)
 heiko1	hey blackburn a question
 blackburn	yes?
 heiko1	c++ /swig /python
 heiko1	I have a class which inherits from a templated class
 heiko1	so class B: A<float64_t>
 heiko1	fixing the template arugment
 heiko1	I can call any methods from B<T> in C++
 heiko1	but not from python modular
 heiko1	says they dont exist
 heiko1	blackburn, any idea how to solve that?
 heiko1	I could make B also a template and then pass the parameter, create a bunch of names for pyhton for all different types
 heiko1	this works
 heiko1	but I dont want to do all the template hell since not needed anyway
 blackburn	wait wait let me understand
 blackburn	nicht schiessen
 heiko1	I will commit this then you can try it out
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	that sounds strange for me actually
 blackburn	didn't know about that
 heiko1	maybe I did a mistake
 blackburn	heiko1: what if A->B->C
 blackburn	and B is templated
 blackburn	while A and C not
 blackburn	does C have methods of A?
 heiko1	dont know
 heiko1	but thats not my problem :D
 blackburn	wait wait
 blackburn	we have such example
 blackburn	heiko1: CPNorm
 blackburn	heiko1: I think it works nice - nothing lost

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: New class for data generation
 heiko1	blackburn, try in python to call the method get_streamed_features of CMeanShiftDataGenerator
 heiko1	probably just me being stupid :)
 heiko1	ah just read a hint in compile warnings
 blackburn	heiko1: what is it?
 heiko1	../../shogun/features/streaming/generators/MeanShiftDataGenerator.h:28: Warning 401: Nothing known about base class 'CStreamingDenseFeatures< float64_t >'. Ignored.
 heiko1	../../shogun/features/streaming/generators/MeanShiftDataGenerator.h:28: Warning 401: Maybe you forgot to instantiate 'CStreamingDenseFeatures< float64_t >' using %template.
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	so here you go then :)
 heiko1	yep
 heiko1	this was not in the interface
 heiko1	mmh
 heiko1	it IS in there
 heiko1	#ifdef USE_FLOAT64
 heiko1	    %template(StreamingRealFeatures) CStreamingDenseFeatures<float64_t>;
 heiko1	#endif
 heiko1	I think the problem is that the wrong class name is used
 heiko1	when compiling the interface
 heiko1	any ideas how to fix that?

 heiko1	this is the class
 heiko1	class CMeanShiftDataGenerator: public CStreamingDenseFeatures<float64_t>

 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	two ideas
 blackburn	idea one - forward declaration of that class in meanshift...h
 blackburn	like template <class T> CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>
 blackburn	template <class T> CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>;
 blackburn	just declaration
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes %template is missing
 heiko1	in fact, it all compiled on my machine

@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know - it is overhyped
@sonney2k	it is just sgd

@sonney2k	but yes it can run on kiloclusters
@sonney2k	that is the cool part about it

@sonney2k	no more horses left :(
 blackburn	I think I do not so will continue tomorrow
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	heiko1, what did you do? you derived from a templated class without specifying the type?
@sonney2k	you crazy?
 heiko1	nono
 heiko1	sonney2k, class CMeanShiftDataGenerator: public CStreamingDenseFeatures<float64_t>
 heiko1	works fine in C++
 heiko1	I think its an issue of renaming CStreamingDenseFeatures<float64_t> to StreamingRealFeatures
 heiko1	when processing Features.i
 heiko1	it does work when I do
 heiko1	template <class T> class CMeanShiftDataGenerator: public CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>
 heiko1	but then I have to create all these names for the different types
 heiko1	which I would like to avoid

@sonney2k	wiking, gtest stuff is really a cool and convenient framework!!

@sonney2k	n4nd0, did you ask georg?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham, such as?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yep
 n4nd0	he is going to contact us by this weekend with his ideas
@sonney2k	n4nd0, names that continue some work are not a good thing
 n4nd0	aham I understand
 n4nd0	and I think it makes sense
@sonney2k	so sth like implement CRFs, Markov Random Field, Conintuos variable SO would be good names :)
 n4nd0	got it
* sonney2k wonders what the issue was with _tom's problem - the tests work just fine...
@sonney2k	who was it who said sparse features + serialization doesn't work?
 n4nd0	not me I think :) AFAIK SGNDArray + serialization doesn't work, other than that everything works :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/851
@sonney2k	this one
@sonney2k	I've just written a test
@sonney2k	and it indeed fails
@sonney2k	wiking, how can I run just a single test e.g. via valgrind?
@sonney2k	debugging?
@sonney2k	with gdb?
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	it is the inplace destructor

 cwidmer	looking into SGMatrixList after all
 n4nd0	reading

 cwidmer	I did some typemaps some time ago
 cwidmer	this one seems to be more involved, though
 n4nd0	then you know more about typemaps than I do :)
 n4nd0	but sonney2k seems very active this evening
 n4nd0	maybe he can help you?
 n4nd0	I am taking a look in any case
 cwidmer	sonney2k, around?
 cwidmer	trying to add typemap for SGMatrixList
 n4nd0	cwidmer: curiosity, what is it you didn't like of the SGNDArray interface?
 n4nd0	cwidmer: stupid question, it hits me that there is matrix_list_from_numpy but no matrix_list_to_numpy
 n4nd0	as for SGMatrix, SGVector, etc
 cwidmer	that's right, its one directional at the moment
 n4nd0	not needed yet?
 cwidmer	only an IN typemap
 n4nd0	ok
 cwidmer	as for SGNDArray, it doesn't let me access the matrices as nicely using operator()
 cwidmer	I mean, SGMatrix now has operator()
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	SGNDArray is a T* actually, isn't it?
 n4nd0	IIRC
 cwidmer	SGMatrixList seems to have operator[]
 n4nd0	yeah, it does
 cwidmer	so it's just a matter of nicely accessing it
 n4nd0	I understand
 n4nd0	cwidmer: did you see SGNDArray::get_matrix()?
 n4nd0	I think it should be better done returning an SGMatrix instead of a T* but still
 n4nd0	good night then guys
