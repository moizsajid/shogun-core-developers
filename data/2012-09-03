 bern4rd	sonney2k: parser.py can be removed is a beta version of parserHTML.py. A parser object is created in views.py as a general variable, when creating the object the path newsfolder is set to /news. then the method parseFolder is called each time the home page is loaded
 bern4rd	in the method parseFolder i check if there is any file in /news that has been modified after the last date i uploaded the news

 blackburn	oh mighty sonne|work is back
 blackburn	uricamic: hey
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: hey
 sonne|work	blackburn: hey yeah!
 sonne|work	blackburn: look at shogun.7nn.de ...
 sonne|work	some updates
 blackburn	things go better
 blackburn	sonne|work: did you make any progress on the foundation thing?
 sonne|work	no
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	I've got new commercial task to participate in
 sonne|work	?
 uricamic	blackburn: hi
 blackburn	some guys need a stereo based pedestrian *counter*
 blackburn	so CRFs and other stuff are waiting for me
 blackburn	sonne|work: scikits going to release tomorrow
 sonne|work	blackburn: so we release today :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: nice application
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes and happily paid again :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw the road sign detector would also be some nice application for the apps folder
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes I planned to integrate that
 blackburn	but not now, no more time left :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: but we need the buildbot to be happy
 blackburn	sonne|work: what's wrong with bb?
 blackburn	all green
 blackburn	battlesystem operational
 blackburn	ehm there are a few issues with integration aka regression tests
 blackburn	uricamic: could you please check whether libshogun BMRM example still works in a correct way?
 uricamic	blackburn: sure
 blackburn	uricamic: I ran it yesterday a few times and it was so random and its convergence path was way too curvy :)
 uricamic	blackburn: hmm, on what data?
 blackburn	uricamic: default
 sonne|work	uricamic: whatever you gave it in the example
 uricamic	i.e. randomly generated
 sonne|work	btw it seemed pretty random to me
 sonne|work	uricamic: maybe better seed the random number generator
 sonne|work	uricamic: CMath::init_random(17);
 uricamic	sonne|work: ok, it was there by purpose to get more testing data
 sonne|work	uricamic: yeah but not good if you want to see if this works reliable / gives same result
 uricamic	sonne|work: ok, I will fix it

-!- av3ngr [~av3ngr@60-241-222-244.static.tpgi.com.au] has left #shogun []
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw did you fix regression_lars.py?
 blackburn	sonne|work: not yet
 sonne|work	blackburn: but apps are good now right?
 sonne|work	or what is missing?
 blackburn	not all
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	oh well I have to test splicer etc
 sonne|work	so what do you still want to do before release?
 blackburn	sonne|work: msplicer fails for sure
 sonne|work	yeah well that cannot work sure
 blackburn	sonne|work:okay we need to
 blackburn	get applications working again
 blackburn	fix all graphical examples
 blackburn	and get tester of static interfaces working again too
 sonne|work	IMHO that is doable for today
 blackburn	sure
 sonne|work	I think I can do some more website polishing and then we should be able to release
 blackburn	but I am not available for serious bugfixing next 4-5 hours
 sonne|work	I guess then we get bug reports and will have to do some 2.0.1 at some point
 blackburn	sure we will have to fix and fix
 sonne|work	but more important we need some nice blog entry describing all the new features
 blackburn	that's eternal
 sonne|work	and progress updates on our twitter :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw click the twitter icon on the homepage :)

 n4nd0	hi blackburn, sonne|work
 sonne|work	blackburn: *lol*
 sonne|work	n4nd0: hey
 n4nd0	did you get some time to take a look to the SGVector's destructor call from the constructor fired by QDA example?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so we release today right?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no - where what?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: do you remember, graphical qda crashes?
 sonne|work	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	let me show you
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/multiclass/QDA.h
 n4nd0	the trace follows something like
 n4nd0	get_mean -> SGVector constructor -> ~SGVector
 n4nd0	no idea why the destructor is called
 blackburn	unbeliebug
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I understand it
 sonne|work	it is just a ptr
 sonne|work	so in get_mean it needs an additional false
 sonne|work	a ptr into an sgmatrix
 sonne|work	I mean
 n4nd0	oh fuck
 n4nd0	to mark that the vector passed in the constructor shouldn't be deleted later right?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I recognize now too
 n4nd0	thank you guys!
 n4nd0	I am going to apply the change and test
 blackburn	we've got a lot of smurf conventional naming
 blackburn	:D

 sonne|work	blackburn: and ninja comments!
 blackburn	sonne|work: a lot of ninja comments
 sonne|work	blackburn: hmmhh maybe we should use http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/ in our doxygen
 blackburn	sonne|work: mathjax is cool, I've been using it on one stie
 sonne|work	blackburn: doxygen has a flag to enable using it instead of manually generating latex images

 blackburn	sonne|work: really?
 sonne|work	http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nlopt/nlopt_2.2.4+dfsg-2.dsc
 blackburn	oh it has recent release
 blackburn	20 july
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the QDA problem is not fixed yet though
 n4nd0	after those changes it still crashes here
 n4nd0	sonne|work: did you test it?
 blackburn	not that dead I thought
 sonne|work	n4nd0: where does it crash?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: classifier_qda.cpp
 n4nd0	in the last line
 n4nd0	retur 0;
 n4nd0	something being deleted twice I think
 n4nd0	trying to find out

 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, now it is working fine again
 n4nd0	there was nothing else to change
 n4nd0	I don't know why but sometimes I keep on getting a Segmentation fault (core dumped) that gets fixed after make clean and build again
 blackburn	n4nd0: is it in python or C++ examples?
 n4nd0	C++
 n4nd0	in python I got glibc instead
 blackburn	well each time you change headers you would need to recompile examples as well
 blackburn	other way it could be dangerous
 blackburn	but it doesn't answer why python fails - it shouldn't fail
 sonne|work	blackburn: now only your example fails :P
 sonne|work	blackburn: ahh no not true - still regression_gaussian_process_demo.py fails
 blackburn	sonne|work: mine? which?
 sonne|work	blackburn: regression_lars.py
 sonne|work	just some double free situation :)
 sonne|work	vector<float64_t> GA1(corr_sign_a);
 sonne|work	this line tells it all
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is example of chiyuan btw :D
 sonne|work	ahh too bad :)
 sonne|work	I prefer blaming you
 blackburn	I don't mind to fix it when I get home still
 sonne|work	blackburn: I had a brief look - I think the fix would be in cholesky_insert - one should rather return the new R (nR) in this function and all good
@sonney2k	blackburn, let met try ...
 blackburn	hah you get home faster
 blackburn	I'm leaving
