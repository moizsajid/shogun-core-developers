 kaushalb09	hi , could any one tell me where can i get the data to run the example
@lisitsyn	kaushalb09: git submodule --init update
 kaushalb09	thank you

 kaushalb09	lisitsyn: could u tell me what type of classification methods you are intending to implement in this gsoc 2013
@iglesiasg	kaushalb09: have you taken a look to GSoC ideas list?
 kaushalb09	yeah
@iglesiasg	there you have it then ;)
@lisitsyn	there is enough info there ;)

 kaushalb09	how about implementing swarm optimization techniques
@iglesiasg	kaushalb09: like ant colony optimization stuff?
 kaushalb09	particle swarm optimization
@lisitsyn	kaushalb09: do you have any reference it may be good for that task?
@lisitsyn	such meta-heuristics are good for highly non-linear opt problems
 kaushalb09	I have personally used it in estimation of software cost
 kaushalb09	http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20573-6_47
@iglesiasg	COCOMO model
@iglesiasg	that sounds funny :)
 kaushalb09	yeah to calculate the parameters of cocomo model
 kaushalb09	constructive cost model
 kaushalb09	can that be one of the idea for implementing in GSoC 2013
@iglesiasg	kaushalb09: we would definitely need to describe it more in depth first
@iglesiasg	look for a mentor, etc
 kaushalb09	i am completely new to GSoC. how do i look for a mentor
 kaushalb09	do i need to describe how and what all features should PSO handle
@iglesiasg	kaushalb09: you can describe the idea in the mailing list too
@iglesiasg	people will give you feedback

 foulwall	saket: pycharm? which language do you use?
 saket	foulwall: C++
 foulwall	platform?
 foulwall	HI sonney2k
 saket	foulwall: platform : Linux / Fedora
 foulwall	oh, maybe codeblocks? which do you prefer? GUI or CLI?
 saket	GUI
 saket	I will check codeblocks in the mean while ...

 saket	 I have one techinical query too ...
 saket	I need to find distance between a SGVector<float64_t> and an index in rhs of CDistance
 saket	So, is the only way to do this is by replacing the lhs of CDistance, right? or is there a better/cleaner/smart work around ?

 deerishi	hi
 deerishi	anyone der?
 deerishi	i hv been trying 2 solve a bug on kernel pca,https://github.com/deerishi/KernelPCA-test-check/blob/master/KernelPCA.py
 deerishi	but even  if  i set the target dimensions to a higher value, m still not getting good results
@iglesiasg	deerishi: hey
 deerishi	hi
@iglesiasg	deerishi: why are you setting the target dimension to higher values?
 deerishi	u told me to implement the sci kit kernel pca example.
@iglesiasg	what is the dimension of th einput data?
 deerishi	input data is 2x100
@iglesiasg	100 points in 2D
 deerishi	but if i dont increase the target dimension ,the apply to feature matrix returns a single dimension array,.yes 100 points in 2d
@iglesiasg	well
@iglesiasg	then, from my scarce knowledge in PCA, I guess that target dimension higher than two doesn't make sense
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: am I wrong?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: probably yes :)
 deerishi	yes i am setting it to 2
@iglesiasg	deerishi: mmm ok - what did you mean with higher target dimensions then? :)
 deerishi	like i said ,by default the target dimensions are being set to 1,which returns a single dimension array
@iglesiasg	ok
 deerishi	the images i am getting are https://github.com/deerishi/KernelPCA-test-check/commit/670ce9dabe334efaac13458dc4648ebd86157799#commitcomment-3052472
 deerishi	can advice on where i might be going wrong.i want to solve this bug today
 deerishi	?
 deerishi	?
 deerishi	?
@iglesiasg	deerishi: you could compare step by step with other implementation to find out where it is wrong

 saket	iglesiasg: hi
 saket	I need to get distance between two SGVector<float>
 saket	Is there a way to do it instead making a CDistance object each time ?
-!- vgorbati [d4029f22@gateway/web/freenode/ip.212.2.159.34] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	saket: mmm I guess you need CDistance
@iglesiasg	check SGVector and Math or Mathematics just in case
 saket	ohkay
 saket	so basically each time i need to convert SGVector to CFeatures then init CDistance and then get the distance ... ?
@iglesiasg	saket: I don't know, I am not sure what you want to do
 saket	I am creating a tree for which i need points to be stored in SGVec..
 saket	and then I also need distances between them for creating the tree
@iglesiasg	yes
