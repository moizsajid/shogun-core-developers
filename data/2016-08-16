 CaBa	h
 CaBa	hi
@wiking	re
 CaBa	wb
 CaBa	wiking: are shogun objects generally safe to copy?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	should be :)
@wiking	CaBa, why?
 CaBa	wiking: dunno, i tried with an SGStringList<char> (or with CStrinFeatures derived from that, not sure) and ended up loosing my strings...
@wiking	ooooooooh
@wiking	CaBa, could you please fire a bug for that
@wiking	since we even have a unit tests for clone-ing
@wiking	:DDD
@wiking	and if that passes
@wiking	then we have a serious problem
 CaBa	i'll try to reproduce it, maybe it was my mistake.
@wiking	thnx a lot
 CaBa	how's the parallel x-val thingy going on? wasn't there a gsoc project for that?
