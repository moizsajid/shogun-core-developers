 RBD	Good day
 RBD	I am looking for a machine learning library to use for a project that uses MinGW. As far as I can tell, Shogun is a good option.
 RBD	I am using the Eigen matrix library in my project and would like to make it available to Shogun. I am unsure of how to do that using cmake. Any pointers? ;)
 RBD	Also (I should have asked this first) is it possible for Shogun to be used with MinGW on Windows?
@wiking	cygwin we had working
 RBD	I am working through the requirements now to see if I can set it up.
