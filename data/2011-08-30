@sonney2k	serialhex, - you patch is not mergable
@sonney2k	you have to rebase it

@sonney2k	morning heiko - glad to see that your gf let you live and code ;-)
 heiko	morning :)
 heiko	yes, me too ;)
 heiko	ok then, now for some hardcore coding action :)

@sonney2k	heiko, just ping me when there is anything
 heiko	sonney2k, ok i will
 heiko	now it the migrate method has to return by reference whether a new TParameter instance is returned, and also if its was was newly allocated
 heiko	so all cases may be handleed
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	seems like you really thought about it all then
@sonney2k	I would have just made the strict assumption - no messing with inputs -
@sonney2k	I think you will have to give me a short 'tutorial' once you are done

@sonney2k	heiko, what's up in the jungle?
 heiko	sonney2k, its horrible
 heiko	every time i touch something, new error araise
 heiko	I can now serialize/deserialize SGVectors
 heiko	but the normal vectors do not work
@sonney2k	heiko, wait the normal serialization stuff no longer works?
 heiko	The most frequent problem is the problem to build a TParameter isntance that can call load, from sratch, meaning that class variables are not attached
 heiko	yes it does, but migration does not
 heiko	normal serialization works all the time
 heiko	because it is done separately
 heiko	but migration of the old style vectors does not yet
 heiko	its really really complicated, so many side-effects to think about
@sonney2k	so for nomal vectors you need extra treatment right?
@sonney2k	like copy doulbe* and len
 heiko	currently i am getting mad because i just dont get it how to create a TParameter instance to load an old style vector
 heiko	yes
@sonney2k	and same with matrix/string/...
 heiko	no even touched this yet
 heiko	only doing vector/matrix
@sonney2k	heiko, how about just *always* returning SGVector etc instead of normal vectors?
@sonney2k	I mean when you have to do migrations then SGVector exists and is a more clean structure to store things
@sonney2k	so then you don't need special extra treatment and the person doing migrations knows that he will only get scalars or SG* structures
 heiko	I also thought of that some time ago but then I would have to modify things even in a deeper layer
 heiko	which then causes even more horrible problems
 heiko	I am getting invalid writes/reads all the time
@sonney2k	hmmhhh, what problems do you have in more deep layers?
 heiko	i would have to modify Tparameter::load for that (to store old style vectors in SGVector)
 serialhex	sonney2k: ok, i'll doo that and re-post it
@sonney2k	serialhex, thanks
@sonney2k	heiko, sorry had to answer some questions here
@sonney2k	heiko, that sounds a lot simpler to me
@sonney2k	^ modifyingt Tparameter::load to optionally store old-style stuff in new-style vectors
 heiko	sonney2k, i got to go now, sorry
@sonney2k	heiko, so what shall we do?
 heiko	i dont know
 heiko	this is simply not easy
 heiko	I dont know if it will be finished quick, I thought I could do it today
 heiko	but the current problem blocks it
 heiko	I pushed all code to my github account
 heiko	perhaps you can take a look
 heiko	here is my test program:
 heiko	http://pastebin.com/Xzxf0bKv
@sonney2k	ok then I guess we will have to make a release w/o this - I don't know whether you will have time to work on this later on such that we can do a proper conversion
 heiko	and here the input file
@sonney2k	later
 heiko	http://pastebin.com/y4xRpy0x
@sonney2k	any thoughts?
 heiko	I will have tome to finish it, but the problem is that i move out of my flat on friday as I already told oyu
 heiko	I will have some time tomorrow in the morning but I really need to start on the flat
@sonney2k	heiko, I know - I am just asking if at all
-!- f-x [75c0d906@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.192.217.6] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	I mean I don't want to be an annoyance pushing you to do work you don't enjoy that much for too much longer
@sonney2k	so I meant more like in the next weeks/months then
 heiko	yes, I know
@sonney2k	I certainly prefer to keep you in the time than to push you beyond what is fun... - so it is really up to you
@sonney2k	heiko, but if you commit doing it - it would certainly be great - but I don't know 1-2 months from now on ETA I guess then?
 heiko	yes something like that
 heiko	next two months are full
 heiko	but again, I think it will work soon, the conecept is there
 heiko	the problems are of technical nature
 heiko	lets do it like this:
 heiko	i will try to finish it in the next days, i have some hours per day
 heiko	and if it works, its great.
@sonney2k	that sounds more like never then - the problem with this is that you really need to be so focussed - deep inside the code that it doing it as a side thing is close to impossible
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	if not?
 heiko	if not, either you have a look, or I will do it later
 heiko	meaning starting again on it in one month
@sonney2k	that is certainly fair
@sonney2k	so we will try to do the tests w/o it and just create new regression tests with the new release
@sonney2k	then make a release and we will see how people react
 heiko	perhaps wait one more day before you start on it
@sonney2k	well we wanted to release tomorrow right :)
 heiko	ok then ..mmh
@sonney2k	then blackburn starts studying again
@sonney2k	I will have a new job ... so it is all difficult for us then for the next few weeks
 heiko	its stupid: the migration basically works, scalars work, SGVectors do work, only the normal vectors do not
@sonney2k	which is the only thing we need to migrate
 heiko	But I will defenetly not finish it today
@sonney2k	yeah I mean I could not foresee that it takes so long and that you were away most of last week
@sonney2k	so it is like it is -
 heiko	Me too, thought it would be done in a week or so, but now I am working on it for two weeks, and the serialization bugs also took a lot of time
@sonney2k	heiko, I am very happy that you intend to finish it and stay around later
@sonney2k	and you've done a great job anyways
@sonney2k	so we should be more in a party than fail mood :)
 heiko	thanks :) but a bit silly that this one does not work out
 heiko	true :)
 heiko	sonney2k, I got to go now, will be back tomorrow for some more talk and coding stuff
 heiko	bye
@sonney2k	we will have another release w/ that feature soon
@sonney2k	so don't worry thanks and bye

 blackburn	sonney2k: any news?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ys
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have to do w/o migrations for the release
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	is heiko out of schedule?
@sonney2k	blackburn, not out of schedule - it is much more difficult than we assumed
@sonney2k	so we should try to check things manually now
@sonney2k	that is use an old shogun version somewhere  - run the python modular examples
@sonney2k	and then compare the output
@sonney2k	with what we get when we run this on some new machine
@sonney2k	err shogun
 blackburn	hmm okay I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have time for that testing?
@sonney2k	not now
@sonney2k	could you start a few things
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	yeah sure, that's why I'm asking
@sonney2k	thanks so please start and document which examples you testes
@sonney2k	did test
@sonney2k	btw you could try to run tester.py
@sonney2k	lets see how much works :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: looks like nothing works :D
@sonney2k	yay!
@sonney2k	congrats
 blackburn	compiling old shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, *arg* the old shogun example also doesn't work

@sonney2k	what's missing now is check tests and make release script / debian package
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would suggest you check the examples and I do the release scripts
@sonney2k	blackburn, when ?
@sonney2k	from whom
 blackburn	sonney2k: take a look on the mailing list
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	yes

 shogun-buildbot	build #171 of octave_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/octave_modular/builds/171
 blackburn	I think there is no reason to check all distances/kernels
 blackburn	will check some of them now
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think you can even script this or?
@sonney2k	*food*
 blackburn	sonney2k: need your help to automate this :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: surprise! gaussian kernel changed result
 blackburn	distance too!
 blackburn	even euclidian distance changed?!
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I guess I know
 blackburn	sonney2k: our saved results are totally useless: we used wrong data reading
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 blackburn	okay distances and kernels should be ok
 blackburn	we haven't changed any compute routines so I'm pretty sure all OK
 blackburn	I had some doubts about parallel things but it is working smoothly
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw let me check if I regenerate the tests if they work or not
@sonney2k	kernel machines were broken before my last commit
@sonney2k	blackburn, please try the predict example in applications/ocr
@sonney2k	it's cool :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I tried it days before
@sonney2k	you mean years?
 blackburn	sth like 0.3 year before hah
@sonney2k	argh
@sonney2k	new crashers
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	try python generator.py in python_modular testsuite
