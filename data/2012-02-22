 n4nd0	sonne|work: sorry, I didn't check the chat for a while
 n4nd0	sonne|work: so I wondered if you had thought before about how the multiboost classes should be included in shogun's hierarchy
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am restricting myself to their implementation of adaboost so far
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but they have it with inheritance to other StrongClassifier class which is more general
 n4nd0	sonne|work: in order to make it easier and start just porting adaboost, do you think it is better to follow as example CLPBoost and that CAdaboost would inherit directly from CLinearMachine and include there all the stuff that it needs from this class for strong classifiers they have
 n4nd0	sonne|work: or to port also their hierarchy of classes with the strong classifier and so on?
 n4nd0	good night
