 alexlovesdata	aehm ... I just checked the example for python_modular fir randomfouriergausspreproc
 alexlovesdata	it makes no sense as it applies a chi2 kernel on the preprocessed features
 alexlovesdata	i will change these examples so that the make sense

@sonney2k	blackburn1, around?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what's up?
@sonney2k	blackbeard1: I am wondering how we could do debian packages
@sonney2k	I am tempted to split up shogun into libshogun / libshogun-dev packages
 blackburn1	sonney2k: well you probably know more about it - what is concrete problem?
 blackburn1	hmm
 blackburn1	dev to store only headers?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yes exactly
@sonney2k	that is how it is done now
@sonney2k	in the debian pacakges
@sonney2k	but difference comes now:
 blackburn1	sonney2k: is there any advantage of doing that?
@sonney2k	I would not attempt to compile all the shogun interfaces
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	we dont' have a zillion of dependencies
@sonney2k	so if some interface (say octave-modular) has a dependency that cannot be satisfied due to whatever octave bug
@sonney2k	the rest of shogun will stay in debian
 blackburn1	shogun-dev shogun-java shogun-python
 blackburn1	etc?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: then what is the question?
@sonney2k	so I would take our shogun src/ dir and remove shogun from it and only keep a *single* interface directory
@sonney2k	then build the interface based on that and the installed libshogun-dev package
@sonney2k	yeah and I would remove all of the shogun-python-static whatever
@sonney2k	and replace it with shogun-static (which would just be elwms)
 blackburn1	sonney2k: so idea is just to unite all static things into one?
@sonney2k	so libshogun, libshogun-dev, shogun-static, shogun-python, shogun-lua, ... etc
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yeah or even not ship any static interface as debian package
 blackburn1	sonney2k: so static won't available using .deb at all?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, what would be a reason to keep it?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I am afraid people still use it
@sonney2k	so we force them to move then
 blackburn1	sonney2k: matlab?
@sonney2k	the only thing that is not working is R
@sonney2k	and screw matlab
@sonney2k	no one is using this
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I am afraid they do
 blackburn1	sonney2k: according to mailing list - it appears sometimes
 blackburn1	and a lot of research code in matlab
 blackburn1	sonney2k: but yes I want to get rid of it
@sonney2k	yeah but what of shogun is available in static interfaces
@sonney2k	like 5% of the features?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yeah good old features from the old shogun
@sonney2k	basically train svm
@sonney2k	that's it
 blackburn1	sonney2k: some oligoblablaweightedkernels
@sonney2k	yeah sure almost all kernels + svms
@sonney2k	blackburn1, maybe we should just mark these interfaces 'deprecated' with the 2.1 release
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yeah
 shogun-buildbot_	build #858 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/858
@sonney2k	so these will no longer be automatically enabled w/ configure
@sonney2k	and when enabled you get a big fat warning
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yeah makes sense to me
@sonney2k	blackburn1, do you remember when we had the last feature improvement for static ?
@sonney2k	or fix even?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes, last winter
@sonney2k	2 or 3 years ago?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I added support for my stupid algorithms
@sonney2k	your dr stuff
 blackburn1	exactly
@sonney2k	but apart from that?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: may be some fixes before yes
 blackburn1	hmm I discovered some bug
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I'd like to get more feedback from bioinformaticians
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: well we should not get general but lose bioinf part
 blackburn1	maybe workshop will help with it
 blackburn1	uh I catched a bug
 blackburn1	sonney2k: when will you get back?
@sonney2k	mid next week though I don't know if I will have time just then
 blackburn1	sonney2k: we need to announce WS soon I think
 blackburn1	I will start writing a GSoC proposal soon too
@sonney2k	blackburn1, I agree - issue is that I cannot get in touch w/ gunnar
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what do you need to discuss?
@sonney2k	and that is pretty problematic - he is our tutorial ml speaker right ...
 blackburn1	ah alright

@sonney2k	blackburn1, when do we have to send in the gsoc proposal?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: 28 march IIRC
 blackburn1	sonney2k: 18 start, 29 end
 blackburn1	sonney2k: april 1-5 -- review
 blackburn1	sonney2k: april 8 - announce of accepted orgs
 blackburn1	sonney2k: april 22 - may 3 -- students proposal submission
@sonney2k	blackburn1, try to not do it last minute...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: will start next week
 blackburn1	be back later
