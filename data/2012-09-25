 wiking	sonne|work: here?
 sonne|work	yes
 wiking	have u managed to get the static analyzer working?
 sonne|work	what is a static analyzer?
 sonne|work	so no :)
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	you know this one: http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/
 sonne|work	ahh
 wiking	i'm happy to help out to make it work
 wiking	but i'd need access to a buildbot where there's clang
 wiking	(i don't have on freebsd)
 sonne|work	no totally forgot about this - please file a github issue about this
 wiking	heheheh ok
 sonne|work	and assign it to me
 wiking	as said if u give me access to a bot i can make it for u :P
 sonne|work	well get it to work locally and I put it live :P
 wiking	sonne|work: afaik you just need to change the ./configure and make command on the bot
 wiking	sonne|work: at least it works for me like that
 sonne|work	wiking: btw I heard you can now be officially called 'husband wiking' - congrats on that!
 wiking	but i'll put it into the github issue, how i build it
 sonne|work	wiking: then just send me these commands and all good
 wiking	sonne|work: ehehhehe thanx!
 wiking	sonne|work: i'll just check now whether you can put the output somewhere else... i mean the output of the static analyzer, since it's by default in a /tmp directory
 sonne|work	ohh that would create clashes
 sonne|work	some local ./tmp would be better
 wiking	yeah it has -o option
 wiking	so it puts it wherever you want it to
 wiking	done
 wiking	it seems i cannot assign
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/789
 wiking	so i think you'll have to assign yourself
 sonne|work	wiking: done
 wiking	yey
 sonne|work	wiking: btw I recall that you wanted to get google mock/test framework to work they way it was supposed
 sonne|work	wiking: well assigned to myself
 sonne|work	not implemented yet
 wiking	the way t was supposed to?
 wiking	ah you mean the whole change about statically linking it with the shogun library?

 blackburn	uh oh ah I have an interview in 3 hours
 wiking	blackburn: goodluckwithath
 blackburn	heh thanks
 wiking	blackburn: where r u heading ?:)
 blackburn	wiking: http://wesee.com/
 wiking	blackburn: oh cool
 wiking	would u move or stay in russia?
 blackburn	no, no
 blackburn	same city
 blackburn	apparently 50 meters far away from current job :D
 wiking	lol
 wiking	nice :)
 wiking	btw: i'll upload a static analyzer output again with the latest code
 blackburn	nice
 wiking	and hopefully sonne|work will make it automatic on one of the buildbots soon
 wiking	done http://maeth.com/shogun-report/
 wiking	blackburn: slep has leaks
 blackburn	wiking: no, not really it is bad code IIRC
 wiking	blackburn: ?
 wiking	blackburn: http://maeth.com/shogun-report/report-a0hTXf.html#EndPath
 wiking	this leaks definitely
 blackburn	wiking: in case of malloc failure?
 blackburn	kind of.. but securing malloc failures is something too safe for me
 wiking	blackburn: you need to release the memory
 wiking	if one of them failed
 blackburn	yeah in ideal case
 blackburn	wiking: what I meant is that if malloc failed here - all the algorithm pukes
 wiking	blackburn: yeah true but better to be safe than sorry afaik
 blackburn	heh right
 wiking	it doesn't really hurt to put 2 if branches there and do a free
 wiking	or even a goto
 wiking	since there's cleanup on the end of the function
 wiking	but this other one is a real leak imho
 wiking	http://maeth.com/shogun-report/report-CTGMmV.html#EndPath
 wiking	as infor really never released
 blackburn	wiking: it is not my code so I didn't really checked for all that stuff :)
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	i was just saying
 wiking	as i think it's either you or sonne|work or me who's gonna fix this :)
 blackburn	oh who else who else
 wiking	:>
 wiking	mmm i still need to hack a bit the primal solver of n4nd0
 wiking	sonne|work: btw if u use the static analyzer it'll create you libshogun.13.0.dylib
 wiking	blackburn: r u still here or on interview now?
 blackburn	wiking: here
 blackburn	wiking: computation mistake :D two hours more
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	do you know anything about the init_opt in StructureModel?
 blackburn	it comes from mosek afaik
 blackburn	or rather for mosek
 wiking	yeah but what's it purpose and how to create it etc?
 wiking	i've checked one example (the MUltiClassModel)
 blackburn	well it is not used at all in case of bmrm
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	i'm just now trying to use the primal solver by n4nd0
 wiking	that's why i'm asking
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	not sure I can help there
 wiking	heheh yeah i've contacted n4nd0... hopefully he'll have time to answer today
 wiking	i've tried with the one in MulticlassSOModel
 wiking	but currently the biggest problem is that mosek eats up my memory
 wiking	virtual memory consumption of that process is about 7 gigs :S
 wiking	while if i use bmrm it uses 200megs
 blackburn	why do you want msoek then?
 wiking	i was just curious
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	mmm something is really wrong.... 12gigs of virtual mem
 wiking	and still nothing
 blackburn	okay let me try to impress these guys :)

 heiko2	sonne|work, sonney2k, around?
 heiko2	or anybody else?
 wiking	yo
 heiko2	wiking hi
 heiko2	I have a c++ problem
 heiko2	I need something which behvaves as static virtual methods
 heiko2	i.e.
 heiko2	I have a base class with a static method
 heiko2	and I want to overload that
 heiko2	(base class is abstract)
 heiko2	and when I call the method, the static method of the subclass should be executed
 heiko2	is there any way to do that?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	hey wiking, how is it going with structured model thing?
 wiking	n4nd0: mmm memory problems
 wiking	heiko2: sorry i just came back
 wiking	heiko2: what you can do is to do a wrapper function that is a virtual
 heiko2	I dont have an instance
 heiko2	of the base class
 wiking	never?
 heiko2	no ist abstract
 heiko2	this has to be solved with templates somehow
 heiko2	Ill put my hack version online soon ans ask people
 wiking	mmm i think u can use using keyword as well
 heiko2	yeah I read about that, but couldnt figure it out
 heiko2	give me an hour, I will post it on github
 wiking	i mean your problem is that foo::bar is static, foo is an abstract class
 wiking	but you have foo2 : public foo
 wiking	and you want to call foo2::bar, right?
 wiking	n4nd0: so the thing starts to grow like hell
 wiking	n4nd0: it hasn't yet really done anything but ate 12gigs of virtual mem
 wiking	n4nd0: mosek is that memory hungry or i'm doing something very wrong? :)
 heiko2	wiking, yes
 wiking	heiko2: and when u try to call foo::bar() what does it say?
 wiking	in foo2
 heiko2	the thing is, the compiler cannot know the subclass since there is no instance which tells type

 n4nd0	wiking: how big are the tests you are running?
 blackburn	that was uhhh
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@141.23.65.251] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 blackburn	I did not expect 2 hour interview :D
 wiking	blackburn: nailed it?
 n4nd0	wiking: have you tried running the examples for the hmsvm and see if that happens there too?
 wiking	n4nd0: no not really
 wiking	n4nd0: i've just tried with my own
 blackburn	wiking: no idea, I feel like I looked stupid
 wiking	n4nd0: it only has 245 examples
 blackburn	but it is the machine learning job I want :(
 wiking	blackburn: it's normal
 n4nd0	wiking: could you take a look if it happens in the hmsvm with the large dataset?
 wiking	n4nd0: cmdline?
 wiking	n4nd0: i mean what should i run
 n4nd0	wiking: one sec, let me check
 blackburn	heiko2: static virtual is a singleton hierarchy I think
 n4nd0	blackburn: it probably went well if it was about ml :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: ml part was ok yes
 heiko2	Ill post the problem, singleton wont work
 wiking	heiko2: gist it
 heiko2	Problem is this:
 wiking	heiko2: but foo::bar() should work
 wiking	regardless if it's a subclass or not
 heiko2	static CStreamingFeatures* from_non_streaming(CFeatures* source_features)
 heiko2	I want a static method in CStreamingFeatures (abstract)
 heiko2	that I can give *any* CFeatures object
 wiking	CStreamingFeatures::from_non_streaming
 heiko2	and then the method calls the implementation in the class of the source_features object
 wiking	in any object should work
 n4nd0	wiking: run structure_hmsvm_mosek.py if python is ok
 wiking	n4nd0: libshogun? :)
 heiko2	if source_features is CDenseFeatures<T>, the method CDenseFeatures<T>::from_non_streaming(CFeatures* source_features) should be called, etc.
 wiking	n4nd0: only python...? as i haven't compiled python interface :P
 n4nd0	wiking: otherwise libshogun/so_hmsvm_mosek.cpp, you can modify CTwoStateModel::simulate_two_state_data if you want to make the dataset larger
 wiking	n4nd0: mmm yeah
 wiking	n4nd0: quite hungry :)
 wiking	2.5g ram
 wiking	and then suddenly drops down to 250megs
 wiking	:)
 wiking	and then dies with segfault
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	?
 n4nd0	that didn't seg fault some time ago :)
 wiking	it does for me
 wiking	lemme gdb it
 n4nd0	in any case I see no reason why you'd like to use mosek instead of any of the bundle methods
 wiking	n4nd0: as the other implementation that i'm comparing with is based on mosek
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	it dies here
 wiking	CStructuredLabels* out = CStructuredLabels::obtain_from_generic(sosvm->apply());
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	so_hmsvm_mosek.cpp:28
 n4nd0	it must be caused by some other recent change I think
 blackburn	dies on obtain from generic?
 blackburn	uhuhuh
 blackburn	or lets say uuuhhhhhhhh
-!- CIA-47 [cia@cia.vc] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 wiking	doh the accuracy is shit 62.04
 wiking	and that's only on structured labels
 wiking	and the train and the test set is the same :D
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	something is very wrong :S
 n4nd0	yeah, that doesn't look good
 wiking	so n4nd0 i need that mosek :)
 n4nd0	what do you mean?
 wiking	that i'd like to get your primal solver to work on with my problem
 wiking	and that it doesn't eat 12gigs of ram
 n4nd0	I would like very much that it works for you too :)
 wiking	ok does the so_hmsvm_mosek.cpp works for you now
 wiking	with the HEAD of master?
 n4nd0	let me check if it works for me with my what I currently have here
 n4nd0	(not updated at all probably)
 wiking	n4nd0: which commit is that? :)
 n4nd0	compiling...
 n4nd0	I am stuck with this error right now
 n4nd0	/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libiomp5.so: undefined reference to `pthread_atfork'
 n4nd0	I'm already including -lpthread
 n4nd0	this error always tends to appear here and I have no idea why, it drives me crazy!
 n4nd0	wiking: can you help me with that error ^?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	what's your compilation line?
 wiking	that gives this error?
 n4nd0	clang++ -O0 so_hmsvm_mosek.cpp -I /usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/h -L /usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/ -lshogun -lpthread -lmosek -o so_hmsvm_mosek -DUSE_MOSEK
 wiking	aaa
 wiking	you dont need -lmosek
 n4nd0	I started using clang++ instead of g++ because I didn't manage to solve this error with g++
 n4nd0	I already tried with that I think
 wiking	as -lmosek is 'linked' with -lshogun
 n4nd0	same thing without -lmosek
 wiking	so shogun.so will depend on mosek
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	makes sense but that didn't make the fix though
 wiking	where's your shogun.so?
 n4nd0	/usr/local/bin/shogun
 wiking	ah and that's in library path?
 wiking	btw: can you do a file /usr/local/bin/shogun/libshogun.so
 wiking	?
 wiking	file /usr/local/bin/shogun/libshogun.so
 wiking	what's the output of this
 n4nd0	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/etc/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin
 n4nd0	that was my LIBRARY_PAHT
 n4nd0	so do you think I need to create this libshogun.so?
 wiking	no
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	/usr/local/bin/shogun/libshogun.so exists
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	no
 wiking	where is it then?
 n4nd0	/usr/local/bin/shogun is a file
 wiking	but where's your dynamic library for shogun?
 n4nd0	whereis libshogun
 n4nd0	libshogun: /usr/local/lib/libshogun.a /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so
 wiking	it should be somewhere under /usr/local/lib
 wiking	ok
 wiking	file /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so
 wiking	what's the output of this
 n4nd0	file /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so
 n4nd0	/usr/local/lib/libshogun.so: symbolic link to `libshogun.so.12.0'
 wiking	ok
 wiking	file /usr/local/lib/libshogun.so.12.0

 wiking	mmm
 n4nd0	so?
 n4nd0	do you have any clue what's going on?
 n4nd0	this lpthread is taking my live :D
 wiking	mmm nos nog fdzlly
 wiking	not really :)
 wiking	as i thought there's a problem with the arch
 wiking	but seems it's ok
 wiking	so now i really have no clue
 wiking	only that maybe the pthread it is trying to use
 wiking	is the x86_64 version
 wiking	not 32bit ...
 n4nd0	who knows
 n4nd0	I have to stop for dinner now
 n4nd0	we'll see later
 wiking	ok
 wiking	mm i dont understand this
 wiking	risk is 0.295583
 wiking	still the results are far from being good :D
 n4nd0	yeah ... it looks a bit weird
 n4nd0	I don't remember the exact value for the risk though
 n4nd0	the problem is I cannot test mosek here if we don't solve this pthread problem :S
 wiking	mmm interesting
