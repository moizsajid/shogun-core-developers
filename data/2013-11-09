 parijat	hi, I have sent a PR for manually adding cluster centers. can someone please review it?
 parijat	there is still indentation problem at a place which I can fix in the final PR with just 1 combined commit. I want to know if apart from that everything else is ok
 parijat	also travis CI build fails at testing python_modular-structure_factor_graph_model. why is that? is it related to kmeans somehow?

 Abhinav	hey. this regarding the code development related to shogun
 Abhinav	which software platform should i use to code, if i want to contribute to shogun's source
 Abhinav	?
 Abhinav	??
@HeikoS	Abhinav: hi
@HeikoS	I am not sure whether I understand your question
 Abhinav	ok. i will clarify
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
 Abhinav	which software platfrom or prog language should i use if i want to contribute in shogun's existing source codes?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you think these grant letters should differ much?
@HeikoS	Abhinav: you can write code in any platform. And as language, well use the one that Shogun's code is written in - these are many
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I dont know, probably tuned towards the specific application
@HeikoS	so I guess some shared parts, some exclusive parts
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean the general words like shogun is blabla should stay in each letter right?
@HeikoS	Abhinav: shogun's core is written in c++, examples are mostly in python, but there is much more
@HeikoS	Abhinav: just brwose the source directory
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you have this google docs shared with you?
 Abhinav	no..
@HeikoS	Abhinav: I prefer developing under linux, but people use other os
 Abhinav	can u pls share it with me?
@HeikoS	Abhinav: it is public available
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you too=
@HeikoS	?
 Abhinav	can u put the link please !
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: and we are going to use it, right?
@HeikoS	Abhinav: See our webpage or github page
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes sure, wiking shared it with me
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, I will do stuff there, but not sure whether I have time
 Abhinav	oh. are you talking about the wiki page?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay let me start then
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll steal your nips submission first
 Abhinav	have you heard of platforms like octave, matlab etc?
@HeikoS	Abhinav: dude, as any other open-source project, our code is available online. we use github, this is all written on our webpage
@HeikoS	Abhinav: yes, all supported by shogun
 Abhinav	is it fine if i use them to implement the algos?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah pls do that
@HeikoS	Abhinav: no, we just use them for examples, core algorithms are written in c++ using some external libraries (again, see source)
@HeikoS	Abhinav: we also have a class documentation on our webpage
 Abhinav	ok.. :) thanks. i ll check and get back.
@HeikoS	Abhinav: your are welcome, see you
