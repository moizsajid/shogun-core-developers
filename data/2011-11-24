@sonney2k	false alarm?
@sonney2k	I mean how is it possible to have an invalid read of size one in this line
 blackburn	sonney2k: ary/
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	ary is a ptr
 blackburn	how big is void pointer?
@sonney2k	8 bytes
@sonney2k	or 4
@sonney2k	depending on 64/32bit system
 blackburn	sonney2k: then I don't know
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you get segfault with that script?
@sonney2k	didn't try
 blackburn	could you please?
 blackburn	I'm currently recompiling and will test again
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you think testing framework is something of interest for gsoc project?
@sonney2k	yes agreed - but we need a concrete plan for that
@sonney2k	and it requires heikos migrations
 blackburn	sonney2k: we have time to think about
 blackburn	wow too late already
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I got segfault again
 blackburn	what a non-sense
@sonney2k	the other thing I'd like to see is a cool tutorial with applications
@sonney2k	blackburn, you should compile with optimizations disabled
 blackburn	sonney2k: already
@sonney2k	and then the usual stuff
@sonney2k	decision trees
 blackburn	ensembles
@sonney2k	boosting etc
@sonney2k	some new ML algos :)
@sonney2k	anyway I am tired
@sonney2k	have a nice sleep
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	have a nice sleep too
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	Labels with same numpy array leads to already freed memory error
 blackburn	that's crazy a lot

 emrecelikten	Hello there! Apparently Gaussian HMMs aren't supported in Shogun. Is there anybody working on it?

 sonne|work	so you could be first :D
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: forgot to say
 sonne|work	yes?
 blackburn	e.g. Labels([1,2,3])
 blackburn	will lead to problems
 blackburn	and we should do Labels(numpy.array([1,2,3]))
 sonne|work	so the numpy one works the other not?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I have too weak ideas what is going wrong but I know it is
 blackburn	sonne|work: I managed to run this python example yesterday
 sonne|work	great that you figured taht out
 blackburn	sonne|work: if you have shogun available could you please run this:
 blackburn	x = [1,2,3]
 blackburn	for i in range(10):
 blackburn	  l = Labels(x)
 blackburn	if it fails I would get more sure about it
 sonne|work	I recall that we had a similar report some time back but no one could reproduce the problem
 blackburn	I shared the folder with that script to madeleine, no report yet
 blackburn	but I hopt it will go smooth this time

 policecar	hey, sorry to bother you(s) again but i can't seem to get PCA to work with sparse matrices... i currently run the code below (python) and can't get rid of
 policecar	assertion features->get_feature_class()==C_SIMPLE failed in file preprocessor/PCA.cpp line 71
 policecar	from shogun.Features import SparseRealFeatures, SparseIntFeatures
 policecar	        from shogun.Preprocessor import PCA
 policecar	        feats = SparseRealFeatures( data.astype(float) )
 policecar	                
 policecar	        preprocessor = PCA()
 policecar	        preprocessor.init( feats )
 policecar	        preprocessor.apply_to_sparse_feature_matrix( feats )
 policecar	where data is a csc_matrix
 policecar	could you gimme any hints as to what i'm doing wrong?
 sonne|work	it doesn't work with sparse matrices - so you need to convert it to dense features and then apply PCA
 policecar	oh
 policecar	hehe, k, thx

 blackburn	sonney2k: my simple labels test does not reproduce the error anyhow
@sonney2k	blackburn, it does
@sonney2k	I can reproduce it here
@sonney2k	but it is not reliable
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm ok
@sonney2k	the issue occurs from time to time only
@sonney2k	if I use Labels([0.0]*1000) it happens most of the time
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess it is something of 'list' type nature
@sonney2k	but I totally don't understand why it crashes sometimes and sometimes not
@sonney2k	yes but it is converted to narray
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it?
@sonney2k	but it crashes even before that(!!!)
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	well no idea then
@sonney2k	yes via PyArray_FromAny
@sonney2k	me neither
 blackburn	no one should use lists to have a conversation with shogun :)
 blackburn	1st commendment
@sonney2k	we could simply disable that
@sonney2k	let me just do that
 blackburn	sure, pretty unsafe
@sonney2k	I still don't understand how it could crash
@sonney2k	(I am in train home - network could fail at any time)
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	you really do shogun all the time :D
@sonney2k	stack overflow or so?
@sonney2k	argh need to leave train
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: what stackoverflow?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean I cannot make sense of this valgrind error nor the crash
@sonney2k	and I don't understand why it still wants to accept lists
@sonney2k	my only idea now is to explicitly reject lists
 blackburn	why not
