 AndreLopes	Is sonney here?
 AndreLopes	or anyone else? :D
* lupinix is here, but he thinks he cannot help with any problems^^ he just started to play around with shogun a little bit
 AndreLopes	oh
 AndreLopes	i just need help to install it on windows
 AndreLopes	i installed cygwin already
 AndreLopes	what should i do next
 lupinix	i'm a pure linux user
 AndreLopes	:(
 lupinix	is there some kind of manual for installation on windows?
 lupinix	looks like you have to compile stuff from source?
 AndreLopes	It seems so
 AndreLopes	i dont understand it very well

 karthikabinav	Hi Andre
 AndreLopes	hi
 lupinix	AndreLopes: which manual do you use for installation?
 lupinix	the ones i found even don't match the installation using cmake

 lupinix	i think using fedora is easier^^ thanks to besser82 we have a complete and well maintained set of shogun packages there
 AndreLopes	oh
 AndreLopes	so theres no way i can use windows?
 lupinix	i don't know... at least cmake stuff and basic libraries should be available in cygwin
 AndreLopes	They are
 AndreLopes	i installed them
 lupinix	do you have any experience with the cygwin/linux terminal?
 AndreLopes	none
 lupinix	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/installation.html seems to be outdated :(
 AndreLopes	erm
 lupinix	recipe would be: open cygwin terminal, download http://shogun-toolbox.org/archives/shogun/releases/3.2/sources/shogun-3.2.0.tar.bz2 using wget, unextract it using "tar -xjvf shogun-3.2.0.tar.bz2"
 lupinix	go into directory using "cd shogun-3.2.0", create build directory "mkdir build", go in "cd build"
 lupinix	then let cmake configure the build process "cmake .."
 AndreLopes	ok
 lupinix	if there are errors or missing dependencies you have to install them and then run cmake again
 AndreLopes	ok so how  do i open cmake
 lupinix	when it is fine: compile using "make"
 lupinix	cmake is a commandline tool should be available in cygwin shell
 AndreLopes	C:\Users\Andr? V Lopes\Downloads\shogun-3.2.0.tar\shogun-3.2.0\shogun-3.2.0
 AndreLopes	its there
 AndreLopes	oh i see
 AndreLopes	so i just go to the folder with cygwin
 AndreLopes	and do the stuff
 AndreLopes	:D
 lupinix	thats why i asked for some terminal knowledge ;)
 AndreLopes	i know prompt of command
 AndreLopes	and gradle and stuff
 AndreLopes	but not linux :D
 lupinix	hopefully cygwin and fedora linux are similar enough in this case ^^
 AndreLopes	how do i
 AndreLopes	go to a certain location
 AndreLopes	for example i wanna go to : D:\shogun-3.2.0
 lupinix	puh... question is: where is D: in cygwin... paths look different on unix like OSes
 lupinix	type "pwd"
 lupinix	to see where you are
 AndreLopes	$ pwd /home/Andr? V Lopes
 lupinix	lets try "cd d:/"
 lupinix	maybe it just works :D
 AndreLopes	$ "cd D:/" -bash: cd D:/: No such file or directory
 AndreLopes	but when i did
 AndreLopes	D:\
 AndreLopes	it seem  to have worked
 lupinix	pwd again
 AndreLopes	it changed to a ">" thoug
 AndreLopes	pwd and nothing changed
 AndreLopes	nothing appeared
 lupinix	then it didn't work
 lupinix	"cd /cygdrive/d"
 lupinix	says google to me :D
 AndreLopes	same thing
 AndreLopes	>
 lupinix	thats the shell prompt, its ok
 lupinix	pwd again
 AndreLopes	nothing
 lupinix	and "ls" (lowercase L)
 AndreLopes	pwdls
 AndreLopes	or pwd ls
 AndreLopes	or ls
 lupinix	only ls
 AndreLopes	none of them changed anything
 AndreLopes	>
 lupinix	whats the output?
 lupinix	of ls
 AndreLopes	nothing
 lupinix	:o
 AndreLopes	wait
 AndreLopes	i reopened cyg
 AndreLopes	and it worked now
 AndreLopes	i can see my D: drive now
 AndreLopes	and i can see shogun folder
 lupinix	:)
 AndreLopes	what should i do now
 lupinix	maybe at first start some variables weren't set properly
 lupinix	cd shogun-3.2.0
 lupinix	to go into the fiolder
 lupinix	(assuming that you are already in d)
 AndreLopes	im there
 lupinix	ls
 AndreLopes	it showed the stuff inside shogun folder
 lupinix	nice
 lupinix	mkdir build
 AndreLopes	done
 lupinix	cd build
 AndreLopes	done
 lupinix	now we start using cmake by "cmake .." (the two points are important)
 AndreLopes	ok
 AndreLopes	so i just say cmake ..
 AndreLopes	?
 lupinix	yes
 lupinix	it should start to look for dependencies now
 lupinix	you will get errors if something important is missing
 AndreLopes	$ cmake .. CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Unix Makefiles".  CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set.  You probably need to select a different build tool. CMake Error: Error required internal CMake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. Missing variable is: CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ENV_VAR CMake Error: Error required internal CMake variable not set, cmake may be not be built correctly. Missin
 AndreLopes	a lot of errors
 AndreLopes	http://pastebin.com/XYv3hsif
 lupinix	make and gcc compilers are missing, you have to install make and gcc-g++ (maybe its called gcc-c++) using the cygwin installer
 AndreLopes	ok
 lupinix	when you installed them: run cmake again
 AndreLopes	1 sec
 lupinix	AndreLopes: does it work now?
 AndreLopes	still installing gcc lol
 AndreLopes	taking ages... idk why
-!- karthikabinav [~karthikab@206-196-186-174.wireless.umd.edu] has quit []
 lupinix	hopefully this one is fixed https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2380
 lupinix	to make some more advertisement for fedora: there you just need to type in "yum install shogun" (and depending on your needs some more packages, i use shogun with python for example) and you got it :D
 AndreLopes	new errors
 AndreLopes	http://pastebin.com/4tqHgeRu
 lupinix	you have to go through the missing libraries now and install them. the missing one raising the error is python
 AndreLopes	ok
 lupinix	others look like optional (but useful) dependencies
 AndreLopes	ok
 AndreLopes	lets see what happens now
 lupinix	AndreLopes: btw i think you should write an email to the mailing list http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/contacts
 AndreLopes	Oh ok
 lupinix	about windows support
 AndreLopes	will i be able to run this on netbeans (java) after all this ?
 lupinix	i don't know, i really have no plan of software development on windows in combination with stuff like cygwin
 AndreLopes	meh
 AndreLopes	I normally use Encog
 lupinix	never used it, i started with python/scikit-learn
 lupinix	AndreLopes: is it compiling?
 AndreLopes	i decided to isntall the whole python package
 AndreLopes	its installing
 AndreLopes	i also installed some other stuff too...
 AndreLopes	if it fails again
 AndreLopes	i will isntall everything
 AndreLopes	i type too fast and i end up saying isntall instead of install...
 AndreLopes	-- To compile shogun type --   make -- -- To install shogun to /usr/local type --   make install -- -- or to install to a custom directory --   make install DESTDIR=/my/special/path --   (or rerun cmake with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/special/path) to just change the prefix -- =================================================================================================================== -- Configuring done -- Generating done 
 lupinix	now "make"
 AndreLopes	do i need to activate java interface first?
 lupinix	yes, if you want to use it with java
 AndreLopes	how do i do that
 AndreLopes	-DJavaModular=ON i tried typing that
 lupinix	cmake -DJavaModular=ON ..
 lupinix	to reconfigure for build with enabled java
 AndreLopes	i need to wait the make command to finish now :D
 lupinix	hopefully it compiles
 lupinix	[02:47:07] <lupinix> hopefully this one is fixed https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2380
 lupinix	found it when searching for cygwin in shogun tickets in github
 AndreLopes	AH you are one of the developers of shogun ?
 lupinix	no
 AndreLopes	22%
 AndreLopes	boring.
 lupinix	but as i'm a fedora developer i know how open source projects work
 AndreLopes	Ah i see.
 lupinix	and a friend of mine (besser82 in irc) is one of the shogun contributors
 AndreLopes	Nice :P
 lupinix	yes ;)
 AndreLopes	im going drink something brb
 AndreLopes	Oh no
 AndreLopes	Im back and

 lupinix	:(
 lupinix	this is exactly the error [02:47:07] <lupinix> hopefully this one is fixed https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2380
 AndreLopes	lol
 AndreLopes	so what should i do
 lupinix	ask the developers at mailing list
 AndreLopes	okay.
 AndreLopes	Post to the mailinglist by sending a message to shogun-list@shogun-toolbox.org ?
 lupinix	yes, but you have to subscribe first by "Subscribe to the mailinglist by sending an empty message to shogun-list-subscribe@shogun-toolbox.org"
 AndreLopes	sent
 AndreLopes	no reply
 lupinix	wait a minute or so
 AndreLopes	ok done
 AndreLopes	it sent me a password too
 AndreLopes	so i just ignore and send the email to the shogun-list@shogun-toolbox.org ?
 lupinix	you confirmed the subscription?
 AndreLopes	yes
 lupinix	now you can send an email to the list
 lupinix	to shogun-list@shogun-toolbox.org
 AndreLopes	relating all that is happening
 AndreLopes	correcT?
 lupinix	relating build on cygwin and your error last message
 lupinix	you could also add this link https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2380 and ask if there is any solution or workaround
 AndreLopes	dang it
 AndreLopes	i already sent
 AndreLopes	Oh well
 AndreLopes	i will just wait for now
 AndreLopes	Do you think it can be solved?
 AndreLopes	the post is from jul 2014
 lupinix	i don't know where the bug is...when it is in cygwin it can be hard to fix it...
 AndreLopes	:9
 AndreLopes	alrighty
 AndreLopes	Ok mate thanks for the help :)
 AndreLopes	Going to sleep now
 lupinix	no problem, hopefully you get it running, otherwise i recommend fedora again :D
 lupinix	there is also a package java-shogun in fedora ;)
 AndreLopes	i might do that
 AndreLopes	alrighty
 AndreLopes	see u tommorow ;P

 TrigonaMinima	It wasn't not done during the last year's GSoC. So will it be included in this year's projects?
 TrigonaMinima	*was
@lisitsyn	TrigonaMinima: I'd have to think about it
@lisitsyn	not really sure it is really needed
@lisitsyn	people learn features with neural nets now :)
 TrigonaMinima	True. :)
 TrigonaMinima	So, what other ideas are there for this year?
