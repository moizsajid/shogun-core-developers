 wiking	blackburn: here?
 blackburn	wiking: yes
 wiking	ok so it's weird
 wiking	when i use python modular
 wiking	and there's and assertation error
 wiking	the script dies with terminate called after throwing an instance of 'shogun::ShogunException'
 wiking	Aborted (core dumped)
 wiking	but actually the exception or the reason why the script died is not printed...
 blackburn	yeah it happens for a reason sometimes
 blackburn	I don't really get why
 wiking	i mean it'd be great if it would print out the error
 wiking	because this way i realised only with gdb
 wiking	that actually the problem was that i have forgotten to call .train() on the machine before doing classification :P
 wiking	have u checked that paper i've sent yesterday
 wiking	?
 wiking	btw it's really weird that multiclasslibsvm performs better than multiclassmkl ;P
 blackburn	wiking: no, I didn't
 wiking	i mean multiclasslibsvm with combined kernel + combined features
 blackburn	wiking: I have no understanding how mkl works :D
 wiking	hehe ok
 wiking	maybe sonney2k will enlighten me ;P

@sonney2k	wiking, mkl is useless. it is no wonder.
@sonney2k	wiking, I have never seen python_modular to die with shogun::ShogunException
@sonney2k	in fact this should not even be possible because we catch these exceptions...
