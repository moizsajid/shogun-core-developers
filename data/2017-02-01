@wiking	nagdev, hi there... there's actually a documentation for gsoc
@wiking	if you are interested applying for it... but on the other hand if you just wanna contribute
@wiking	there are many issues marked as 'entrance': https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aentrance
@wiking	try to tackle one of them

@wiking	sonney2k, ping
@sukey	Pull Request #3597 "Add Scala Interface"  synchronized by abhinavrai44 - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3597
 nagdev	wiking, thanks for the reply. I'm interested in applying for gsoc. I've been through the documentation and the project list. I wanted to know if it's fine if I choose a project rightaway, one that I feel involves the best use of my skill.
 nagdev	Or should I interact with you guys more often and figure out what projects are going to be pursued
@wiking	nagdev,  at this point
@wiking	the more entrance issues you can do
@wiking	and close
@wiking	the better
@wiking	it doesn't have to be from one area
@wiking	it's more up to your liking
@wiking	from that we can assess your skills
 nagdev	Ok. I'll get started on that
@wiking	yeah just choose any of those bugs in the list
@wiking	and try to see which one you can fix
 nagdev	One more thing, I saw that "The usual suspects" project requires the use of external benchmarking systems that I'd have be acquainted with in order to do the project. Should I start that too?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	as you wish
@wiking	i mean if you wanna do the usual suspect
@wiking	then of course you should get familiar
@wiking	with the benchmarking framework mentioned
 nagdev	I just found the entrance task for the project from last year https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2991 . Is it ok if I start with this one?
 abhinav	ping : Wiking
@wiking	pong
 abhinav	Hi. how are you ?
@wiking	nagdev, sure, but make sure before you seriously dig into it
@wiking	to choose a right one
@wiking	i.e. currently somebody already working on KNN
@wiking	abhinav, good how about you? how can i help?
 abhinav	I am good. I am working on the scala interface and the octave modular fails for random_forest
 abhinav	Also can you look at the PR so I can many any further changes if required
 abhinav	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3597
@wiking	abhinav, ignore octave for the time being
@wiking	it's unrelated
@wiking	so ok abou tthat
@wiking	regarding the sdk patch
 abhinav	So can you merge. I wanted to begin another task..
@wiking	i would use ADD
@wiking	for adding a url
@wiking	https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add
@wiking	so instead of RUN wget www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.7.deb
@wiking	ADD http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.7.deb /tmp/scala.deb
@wiking	and then just
@wiking	RUN sudo dpkg -i /tmp/scala.deb
@wiking	and then you dont need the rm -rf
@wiking	because it's in /tmp
@wiking	other thing is that if you add scala
@wiking	i would add sbt as well
 abhinav	Ok I'll get both these thing done.
@wiking	4rd
@wiking	i mean 3rd
@wiking	ah ok nothing
 abhinav	Thanks

 abhinav	Ping : wiking
@wiking	pong
 abhinav	I've made the changes. Only Scala tests are failing cause DetectScala has not been merged
 abhinav	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3606
-!- mikeling [uid89706@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-qjbweznrtdzjrwpe] has quit [Quit: Connection closed for inactivity]
@wiking	?
@wiking	there's no official cmake module for detecting scala?
@wiking	btw sbt is still missing from the docker sdk
@wiking	and this is completely wrong
@wiking	set(SCALA_JARS "/usr/share/java/scala-compiler.jar:/usr/share/java/scala-library.jar:/usr/share/java/scalap.jar:/usr/share/java/scala/jline.jar:/usr/share/java/jansi.jar")
 abhinav	Oh sorry. I forgot to add sbt
@wiking	scala-library.jar
@wiking	i reckon scala can give that to you
-!- praisethemoon [~praisethe@197.3.11.178] has joined #shogun
 abhinav	So, I should contact Scala for cmake module ?
@wiking	no
 abhinav	Yeah there's no official copy for Detecting Scala
@wiking	but scala itself can tell you
@wiking	where is the scala-library.jar
@wiking	as that should be in the classpath
 abhinav	Ok
 abhinav	Also what do you mean by
 abhinav	set(SCALA_JARS "/usr/share/java/scala-compiler.jar:/usr/share/java/scala-library.jar:/usr/share/java/scalap.jar:/usr/share/java/scala/jline.jar:/usr/share/java/jansi.jar")
@wiking	find_program(Scala_JAR_EXECUTABLE
@wiking	+  NAMES scala-library.jar
@wiking	+  PATHS ${_SCALA_PATHS}
@wiking	+  )
@wiking	this part could be done
@wiking	by executing a scala code
@wiking	and printing the location to stdout
@wiking	and this is totally wrong
@wiking	mark_as_advanced(
@wiking	+  Scala_SCALA_EXECUTABLE
@wiking	+  Scala_JAR_EXECUTABLE
@wiking	+  Scala_SCALAC_EXECUTABLE
@wiking	+  )
@wiking	this is oldschool cmake
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/cmake/FindJinja2.cmake#L13-L18
@wiking	take it as an inspiration
 abhinav	Thanks for your help. I'll make the changes
 abhinav	Sorry again for the sbt thing

@wiking	lisitsyn, pingu
@wiking	nothing
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
@wiking	so i was wondering
@wiking	whether we should actually change the master branch to be protected
@wiking	with ' Require branches to be up to date before merging'
@wiking	+ Require status checks to pass before merging
@wiking	done
@wiking	:)
