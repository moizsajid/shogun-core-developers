@wiking	nagdev, hi there... there's actually a documentation for gsoc	05:52
@wiking	if you are interested applying for it... but on the other hand if you just wanna contribute	05:52
@wiking	there are many issues marked as 'entrance': https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aentrance	05:53
@wiking	try to tackle one of them	05:53

@sukey	Pull Request #3597 "Add Scala Interface"  synchronized by abhinavrai44 - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3597	06:43
nagdev	wiking, thanks for the reply. I'm interested in applying for gsoc. I've been through the documentation and the project list. I wanted to know if it's fine if I choose a project rightaway, one that I feel involves the best use of my skill.	06:50
nagdev	Or should I interact with you guys more often and figure out what projects are going to be pursued	06:51
@wiking	nagdev,  at this point	07:04
@wiking	the more entrance issues you can do	07:04
@wiking	and close	07:04
@wiking	the better	07:04
@wiking	it doesn't have to be from one area	07:04
@wiking	it's more up to your liking	07:04
@wiking	from that we can assess your skills	07:05
nagdev	Ok. I'll get started on that	07:09
@wiking	yeah just choose any of those bugs in the list	07:10
@wiking	and try to see which one you can fix	07:10
nagdev	One more thing, I saw that "The usual suspects" project requires the use of external benchmarking systems that I'd have be acquainted with in order to do the project. Should I start that too?	07:12
@wiking	mmm	07:12
@wiking	as you wish	07:12
@wiking	i mean if you wanna do the usual suspect	07:13
@wiking	then of course you should get familiar	07:13
@wiking	with the benchmarking framework mentioned	07:13
nagdev	I just found the entrance task for the project from last year https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2991 . Is it ok if I start with this one?	07:35
abhinav	ping : Wiking	07:37
@wiking	pong	07:37
abhinav	Hi. how are you ?	07:37
@wiking	nagdev, sure, but make sure before you seriously dig into it	07:37
@wiking	to choose a right one	07:37
@wiking	i.e. currently somebody already working on KNN	07:38
@wiking	abhinav, good how about you? how can i help?	07:38
abhinav	I am good. I am working on the scala interface and the octave modular fails for random_forest	07:39
abhinav	Also can you look at the PR so I can many any further changes if required	07:39
abhinav	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3597	07:40
@wiking	abhinav, ignore octave for the time being	07:40
@wiking	it's unrelated	07:40
@wiking	so ok abou tthat	07:40
@wiking	regarding the sdk patch	07:40
abhinav	So can you merge. I wanted to begin another task..	07:41
@wiking	i would use ADD	07:41
@wiking	for adding a url	07:41
@wiking	https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add	07:41
@wiking	so instead of RUN wget www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.7.deb	07:41
@wiking	ADD http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.7.deb /tmp/scala.deb	07:42
@wiking	and then just	07:42
@wiking	RUN sudo dpkg -i /tmp/scala.deb	07:42
@wiking	and then you dont need the rm -rf	07:42
@wiking	because it's in /tmp	07:42
@wiking	other thing is that if you add scala	07:42
@wiking	i would add sbt as well	07:42
abhinav	Ok I'll get both these thing done.	07:43
@wiking	4rd	07:43
@wiking	i mean 3rd	07:43
@wiking	ah ok nothing	07:43
abhinav	Thanks	07:44

@wiking	pong	08:36
abhinav	I've made the changes. Only Scala tests are failing cause DetectScala has not been merged	08:37

@wiking	?	09:04
@wiking	there's no official cmake module for detecting scala?	09:04
@wiking	btw sbt is still missing from the docker sdk	09:04
@wiking	and this is completely wrong	09:04
@wiking	set(SCALA_JARS "/usr/share/java/scala-compiler.jar:/usr/share/java/scala-library.jar:/usr/share/java/scalap.jar:/usr/share/java/scala/jline.jar:/usr/share/java/jansi.jar")	09:04
abhinav	Oh sorry. I forgot to add sbt	09:05
@wiking	scala-library.jar	09:05
@wiking	i reckon scala can give that to you	09:06
-!- praisethemoon [~praisethe@197.3.11.178] has joined #shogun	09:06
abhinav	So, I should contact Scala for cmake module ?	09:07
@wiking	no	09:08
abhinav	Yeah there's no official copy for Detecting Scala	09:08
@wiking	but scala itself can tell you	09:08
@wiking	where is the scala-library.jar	09:08
@wiking	as that should be in the classpath	09:09
abhinav	Ok	09:09
abhinav	Also what do you mean by	09:10
abhinav	set(SCALA_JARS "/usr/share/java/scala-compiler.jar:/usr/share/java/scala-library.jar:/usr/share/java/scalap.jar:/usr/share/java/scala/jline.jar:/usr/share/java/jansi.jar")	09:10
@wiking	find_program(Scala_JAR_EXECUTABLE	09:12
@wiking	+  NAMES scala-library.jar	09:12
@wiking	+  PATHS ${_SCALA_PATHS}	09:12
@wiking	+  )	09:12
@wiking	this part could be done	09:12
@wiking	by executing a scala code	09:12
@wiking	and printing the location to stdout	09:12
@wiking	and this is totally wrong	09:13
@wiking	mark_as_advanced(	09:13
@wiking	+  Scala_SCALA_EXECUTABLE	09:13
@wiking	+  Scala_JAR_EXECUTABLE	09:13
@wiking	+  Scala_SCALAC_EXECUTABLE	09:13
@wiking	+  )	09:13
@wiking	this is oldschool cmake	09:13
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/cmake/FindJinja2.cmake#L13-L18	09:14
@wiking	take it as an inspiration	09:14
abhinav	Thanks for your help. I'll make the changes	09:15
abhinav	Sorry again for the sbt thing	09:15

@wiking	lisitsyn, pingu	11:21
@wiking	nothing	11:22
lisitsyn	wiking: hey	11:23
@wiking	so i was wondering	11:23
@wiking	whether we should actually change the master branch to be protected	11:24
@wiking	with ' Require branches to be up to date before merging'	11:24
@wiking	+ Require status checks to pass before merging	11:24
@wiking	done	11:26
