@sonney2k	yeah the guy at the very left that appears a couple of times is a ML person
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	there are others but hard to descibe :D

 n4nd0	sonney2k, alexlovesdata: about comparing the results of my SO code with SVM-struct for multiclass
 n4nd0	I am not sure if it is possible since they don't have exactly the same formulation of the problem
 n4nd0	sonney2k: can it be reliable to compare results of the primal formulation with results of the dual?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well now that uricamic merged his MC example based on his BMRM implementation it is probably easier to compare against that
@sonney2k	vojtech_, am I right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I found something that might work though, they provide code to solve a 1-slack formulation of the problem in the primal
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what we have is a n-slack formulation
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw is nico on vacations?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: BUT in the paper they say that a w solution of one problem is solution of the other
@sonney2k	n4nd0, IIRC this is all equivalent
 vojtech_	sonney2k: yes, Michal reimplemented BMRM which we have been using many times and it seems to work correctly
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he said that his vacations will start from the middle of the next month
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw, will there be a problem with that and this mid-term report?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so you should work with uricamic to compare your mosek based code against his impl.
@sonney2k	you should both get very similar objective
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that sounds better, I am going to talk to him
@sonney2k	and then all is good
@sonney2k	vojtech_, thanks - as I understand uricamic is now working on the new fancy thing right?
@sonney2k	vojtech_, ahh and btw if you have some nice application for this SO stuff (something fancy/graphical) it would be cool to have it as illustration...
 vojtech_	sonney2k, once he finishes implenmentation of plain BMRM (which is probably already done) he will implement original Bundle method - I don't know if this is sufficiently fancy but it works faster :)
@sonney2k	vojtech_, well I meant something like word recognition / licence plate / image segmentation ...
 vojtech_	yes, we have OS library for face landmark detection see: http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~uricamic/flandmark/
 vojtech_	license plate will not be public but we have lot of StructSVM examplables for image segmentation etc.
@sonney2k	vojtech_, what I meant is some fancy example that can be put into shogun
@sonney2k	you know better what is easy / complex enough :D
 vojtech_	ok, I'll think about it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw if you are stuck for too long - investigate intensively with nico
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he told me he's preparing a document with HMSVM info that should be ready by the end of this week
 n4nd0	sonney2k: until that, I want to test the so-multiclass and get familiarized with the Viterbi impl. in Shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0, for how long are you trying to figure out whether the MC - SO SVM is correct?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have been with it basically this week and the last one ...
 n4nd0	I think it has been a loss of time to tell the truth
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah so you should have a meeting with nico, uricamic *ASAP*
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@202.130.113.141] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	n4nd0, email them asking them if they have time this afternoon and CC me...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have no time this afternoon
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well when do you have time now?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: today it is midsommar in Sweden, national holiday
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what I am saying is ASAP - otherwise you will become demotivated
@sonney2k	trying for 2 weeks to find out what is wrong is just to long
@sonney2k	too
@sonney2k	1 week is already very tiring
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah
 n4nd0	but Nico told me to wait until he has ready the file with the new work to do
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so you definitely need help here!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no
@sonney2k	the document can wait
@sonney2k	n4nd0, or do you have something else to do?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: apart from shogun you mean?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no for GSoC I mean
 n4nd0	no
@sonney2k	and the viterbi in shogun is very hard to digest
@sonney2k	even worse I would say
 n4nd0	the plan was to check viterbi
 n4nd0	mmm but I'll need to use it in any case
 n4nd0	maybe I should get familiarized with it at least
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I tend to say that writing your own is easier!
@sonney2k	the one in shogun is very specialized
@sonney2k	and not just for HM-SVM
@sonney2k	but for semi-HM SVM
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	-> much more difficult
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ask nico and uricamic now!
 n4nd0	yeah, I studied your paper about it a couple of days ago
@sonney2k	and don't work on comparing this stuff ... it doesn't help to kill more time with this. you need some principled investigation now
 n4nd0	what do you mean with principled investigation?
 n4nd0	what do you want me to do?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, have a session with uricamic/nico
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what should we disscus on it?
@sonney2k	- compute objective in your / uricamic's MC SO
@sonney2k	- ensure that you are both solving the same problem
 n4nd0	I have just asked uricamic about that
@sonney2k	- compare if objectives deviate by no more than epsilon
 n4nd0	it looks that the formulation is not the same
 n4nd0	his problem is about risk minimization
 n4nd0	I don't think it is just the algorithm that changes but also the objective
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well you both solve the true MC problem w/o bias
@sonney2k	the CS formulation right?
@sonney2k	so when you have done that you get as result a couple of w's
 n4nd0	he has just told me that his formulation is
 n4nd0	min_{w} 1/2 ||w||^2 + R
@sonney2k	using these w's you can compute an unconstrained objective
@sonney2k	and compare it
@sonney2k	n4nd0, looks like the same as yours or?
 n4nd0	mine uses sum_i xi_i instead of R
 n4nd0	I am not completely sure what his R is though
 n4nd0	probably it is the risk
 n4nd0	and one can choose the regularizer for it
 n4nd0	but the constraints are probably different
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is the risk term
@sonney2k	n4nd0, sum of slacks weighted with C
@sonney2k	n4nd0, one can solve the problem in an unconstrained and a constrained way
@sonney2k	uricamic, does it the unconstrained you the constrained way
@sonney2k	but you can compute the unconstrained objective and compare with his result
@sonney2k	all you need for that is the w's
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think uricamic went for a while, maybe he's not back yet
@sonney2k	n4nd0, probably lunch time now

 n4nd0	hi nicococo, how are you?
 nicococo	hi n4nd0: so mc svm is fine and we are now approaching the hmsvm ?
 n4nd0	nicococo: about the mc svm I just wanted to check the results with other implementation of the same thing to ensure it is ok, I think svm-struct can be useful for this
 n4nd0	nicococo: but yes, we can start approaching hmsvm
 n4nd0	nicococo: I studied the paper about semi hm-svm as you suggested to find out a bit more about these plifs
 n4nd0	nicococo: but I am afraid I have not clear why the pop up in hm-svm yet
 nicococo	ok, its good to get a general idea but of course the paper is much more advanced than our next step
 n4nd0	yeah
 nicococo	as i told  you, i am preparing a document with detailed information (and nice pictures)
 n4nd0	yeah, that sounds awesome
 n4nd0	about the Viterbi implementation
 n4nd0	I don't know if you checked the irc logs
 n4nd0	but sonney2k has told me some minutes ago that it would be better to do a new implementation for it
 nicococo	no..
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/%23shogun.2012-06-22.log.html
 n4nd0	12:17
 nicococo	no problem. i can give you a 30 lines of c code doing what we need
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	unfortunately the document is not finished yet :(
 n4nd0	no problem
 n4nd0	for me it's ok to follow with my plan of comparing the results with svm-struct for multiclass
 n4nd0	they provide a solver for the 1-slack formulation
 n4nd0	in the primal
 n4nd0	we have the n-slack
 n4nd0	for I am reading in the document that they are somewhat equivalent
 n4nd0	:%s/for/but ^
 n4nd0	so I am just going to get the svm-struct running and check if w is close to my w
 nicococo	thats okay. if you have some time i would suggest, that you also start writing down how you would approach the hmsvm..
 nicococo	maybe its easier to see where problems are.. what do you think?
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@89.13.broadband14.iol.cz] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 nicococo	oh.. and one more thing: forget the plifs :)
 n4nd0	haha ok :)
 n4nd0	maybe now is too fast to say how I would approach it in detail
 n4nd0	but my general idea is to first have the three pieces that we would give to the PrimalMosekSOSVM
 n4nd0	psi
 n4nd0	argmax = viterbi
 n4nd0	delta loss = ?
 nicococo	for delta we can use hamming loss
 n4nd0	but how is it defined for sequences?
 n4nd0	forget about what I have just said...
 nicococo	:)
 n4nd0	but there must be more apart from this
 nicococo	i'll cover that in the document
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so do you know something about what I said of 1-slack and n-slack for the primal so-svm?
 n4nd0	should I just expect that both give the same w (accepting some error for the difference in the optimizer, etc)
 n4nd0	or?
 nicococo	this is another optimization approach. there are several possible but this aims in the direction of bundle methods
 nicococo	yes, same data should produce the (almost) same output
 nicococo	depends on the stopping criterion and so..
 nicococo	you can compare the objective values also
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@89.13.broadband14.iol.cz] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	what do you mean with the objectives values?
 nicococo	the objective function value at w^*
 n4nd0	got it
 nicococo	okay.. i go to lunch now. if there are probs just write an email.. i will be here again later ..
 n4nd0	ok, not me probably
 n4nd0	today is midsommar :)
 nicococo	enjoy ;)

 pluskid	sonney2k: how to disable pthread when compiling? I'm having some strange bugs here: it hangs when computing dense_dot_range of DotFeatures
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@89.13.broadband14.iol.cz] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	pluskid just Set number of threads to 1
 pluskid	sonney2k: where to set?
@sonney2k	obj.parallel.set_num_threads(1)
@sonney2k	pluskid, ^
 pluskid	sonney2k: ok, thanks!
@sonney2k	pluskid, where does it hang btw?
@sonney2k	I am not aware of any issues...
 pluskid	sonney2k: finally I traced it is not happening in dot product, but somewhere  SG_UNREF
 pluskid	maybe some memory issue
 pluskid	wild pointers maybe
 pluskid	I'm still trying to dig deeper
@sonney2k	pluskid, doing what?
 pluskid	sonney2k: when I'm testing the ShareBoost implementation, when setting the features of a linear machine
@sonney2k	pluskid, just setting features you mean?
 pluskid	sonney2k: yeah
@sonney2k	sounds weird...
 pluskid	yeah, I think I should double check my code to ensure all memory operations are correct
@sonney2k	valgrind is your friend :)
 pluskid	it hangs on the SG_UNREF statement of setting features
 pluskid	ah, I almost forgot about valgrind, thx!
@sonney2k	pluskid, sounds like uninited memory
@sonney2k	probably features wasn't inited with NULL
 pluskid	seems not, it hangs on the 2nd time when setting features
 pluskid	1st time when features are previously NULL is OK
 pluskid	SG_UNREF on an non-NULL features hangs
 pluskid	not sure whether the features corrupted
 pluskid	anyways, it is strange that the program hangs, instead of segfault or something
@sonney2k	pluskid, hmmhh well with memory corruptions anything can happen
