 Saurabh7	hi, I was planing to apply for gsoc with shogun... for the fundamental ml project ,i was trying to work on https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1110
 Saurabh7	so is this a good idea? and i wanted to know what changes are expected there?
@iglesiasg	hi Saurabh7
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, thank you for your interest in the project
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, working on that issue is indeed a good idea, as it is mentioned as a GSoC entrance task for the fundamental ML project
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, actually, it is very suitable since none is working yet on the decision trees part
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, have you read the comments made by wiking in the pull request?
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, yup i read the comments
 Saurabh7	it was suggested that shogun/multiclass/tree/TreeMachine.h should be involved
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, and also
@iglesiasg	"a classifier and it's implementation should be under src/shogun/ and not part of an example. Examples are strictly for small examples where you 'show' how one can use a given module of shogun"
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, maybe you can have a look at TreeMachine.h and think about the ID3 implementation of the PR can be done following what is in TreeMachine
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, yes sure, the PR defines its own nodes and stuff, instead will have to use the treemachine ones
@iglesiasg	I see that there is also some use of STL in library code that may be visible from the interfaces
@iglesiasg	once has to fix that
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, just go ahead then if you have the idea clear :)
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, ok sure I will start working,will ask again if i get stuck or something ....thanks
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, sure, no problem! Feel free to discuss a little bit more in detail the design once you have thought about it
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, wiking probably had something already in mind so his feedback will be useful
 Saurabh7	ok, will get back soon then

 pickle27	can you send me a small dump of the irc logs from the website?
 pickle27	I want to make sure that page looks right
 pickle27	Im aiming to make a PR today then we can start to deploy
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: adrin, naywhayare, HeikoS
 sonney2k	pickle27, demo first ;)
 pickle27	sure
 sonney2k	pickle27, I am still searching for the script...
 sonney2k	pickle27, okido you got mail
-!- Netsplit over, joins: naywhayare, adrin
 pickle27	awesome thanks!
 sonney2k	pickle27, does it work?
 pickle27	I haven't checked yet, got a few other things to fix up first
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: hi!
 HeikoS1	sonney2k:  did you see the mail from ryan?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I think I will add a project description on this now
 HeikoS1	if there would be two people working on this cross-testing stuff, that would be amazing
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, *overload*
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: could you send me my login for the webpage?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: not good?
 HeikoS1	we could just attract someone and let him be mentored by ryan :)
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: how do you like the example project ?
* sonney2k in overload mode
 HeikoS1	haha ;)
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, barely read stuff in the ideas list
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: ok, dont worry then
 HeikoS1	I will write something up anyways, might be useful to have that description
 HeikoS1	attract more people :)
 HeikoS1	just got another co-mentor yesterday btw
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, excellent
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, for some reason shogun-python is stuck in debian new...
 HeikoS1	sonney2k:  stuck means what?
 sonney2k	sitting there for 2 weeks without anything to happen
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what would be a good mentor for this mlkpack collarboration?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: mmh, dont know what could cause that ....
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, well lack of manpower / interest as usual
 sonney2k	we need an ftpmaster to review the pkg
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I see
 HeikoS1	what about the guy we met at the summit?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, I asked already
 sonney2k	trying agin
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: could you send me a login for the website?
 HeikoS1	you can ecrypt to me @herrstrathmann.de adress
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, anyone can but sure
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, well you password is heiko now
 sonney2k	just log in and change it immediately
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: thanks, done
 HeikoS1	You don't have permission to edit anything.
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, you are superuser now
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: thanks, that worked
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: whats really important next ?
 HeikoS1	apart from all those bugs and more entrance tasks
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: adrin, naywhayare
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, for me debian packages
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, and did somebody put up the task with the packages?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, we really need that
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, and shogun and teaching / demos / notebooks - that needs to be put up too
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: ah yeah
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, then also workshop organizing / announcing
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, and foundation
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I would do that, but I dont know anything about packaging
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, btw is the money there yet?
 HeikoS1	so no idea what to write apart from blabla intro
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, well I want to - we need that
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, ahh no gunnar sent some text around back then
 HeikoS1	ok, ah yeah
 HeikoS1	could you go over it once and then send my via email? I can make it final
 HeikoS1	mentors?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: ah yeah notebooks and teaching/demos .....
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, I guess me
 HeikoS1	haha
 HeikoS1	10 projects ;)
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, what?
 HeikoS1	quite some stuff is there now
 HeikoS1	I have a good feeling about this gsoc
 HeikoS1	lots of very useful things this year
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, lets hope we get accepted
 HeikoS1	rather than 10 new algorithms
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: why shouldnt we?
 HeikoS1	more stuff than previous years
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, well there are no guarantees
 HeikoS1	+workshop + foundation
 HeikoS1	I know
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: mentor for packaging? you and viktor?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, yeah
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, btw vojtech sent me an updated description
 sonney2k	could you put it live
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: yeah forward
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, he had also a couple more (cool) ideas - let me forward his email
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: cool
 HeikoS1	its always good to have more, less work next year :)
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: btw whats this nonsense with realloc changing the pointer?
 HeikoS1	why cant I cut off some part of a block?
 HeikoS1	that seems weird to me
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, not nonsense
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, makes a lot of sense to me
 HeikoS1	why?
 HeikoS1	I mean yeah there are reasons for doing this, but I should also be allowed to say "no" to this in my eyes
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, well some history about this hack(!)
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, back then I had sth like a 3GB matrix (around year 2000)
 sonney2k	and that was barely fitting into memory
 sonney2k	processing time was too slow
 HeikoS1	yeah I totally see the point of this in shogun
 HeikoS1	but not in c++
 sonney2k	and lots of noise in the data
 sonney2k	so I used a double* data
 sonney2k	and did modify the data *inplace*
 sonney2k	and then just set different #features, #vectors
 HeikoS1	yeah I see
 sonney2k	keeping the whole memory block allocated!
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.237.145.205] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 HeikoS1	I told the guy to add an option either like you just said or copy it to a smaller one and free the old
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, I mean even allocating anything on top was not possible
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, yes seen that
 sonney2k	makes sense
 HeikoS1	yes, but best thing would be to do in place and then cut off the last part
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, that is surely not possible
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.237.145.205] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS1	I dont understand why
 sonney2k	realloc might do that or might not
 sonney2k	why not?
 HeikoS1	realloc doesnt offer an option to keep the pointer const and just change size
 HeikoS1	(if it is made smaller)
 sonney2k	you cannot assume the memory management will just allow you to create huge holes
-!- zxtx [~zv@2607:ff38:3:811c:f4fd:b74f:f882:a9e6] has joined #shogun
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, so it might just put the tiny memory you request for alloc someplace where there is just some tiny hole
 sonney2k	freeing a huuge block
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, did you get vojtechs email?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I see that, keeps memory defragged, *but* it would be nice to have an option
 HeikoS1	but whatever, cannot change that
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, I think he is right - we should just demo how to use shogun w/ kaggle / common tasks
 HeikoS1	finally the bug is sorted out ...
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, I knew that bug but didn't find the time to reply...
 sonney2k	sigh
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: dont worry, its all sorted now, the guy is doing a great job
 HeikoS1	and enjoys it :)
 HeikoS1	vojtechs idea is cool
 HeikoS1	if we only had 10  more people ;)
 sonney2k	yes tell him that he does a great job - he is *really* cool
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, you say that every year
 sonney2k	but in fact we are a lot more now
 HeikoS1	haha
 HeikoS1	indeed
 sonney2k	and admittedly only due to gsoc!
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, btw did you write your success thing with lisitsyn1?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, and did the gsoc money arrive already?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: not yet, actually we have a date today to start
 HeikoS1	ah let me check
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: nope
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, btw we need to fix the equals method in parameter comparing doubles!
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: is there an issue or a description?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, we do some (wrong!) abs(a-b)<eps
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what do you think about asking the new gsoc projects to be in BSD3?
 sonney2k	to say stuff equals
 sonney2k	which fails in about 1000000 cases
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: could you point me to something concrete?
 sonney2k	for example NaN, inf etc
 HeikoS1	ah
 sonney2k	I fixed that in the python tester
 HeikoS1	ok
 sonney2k	let me point you to the code
 HeikoS1	so whats your suggestion on that?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: could you open an issue assign it to me and add link to code in there?
 HeikoS1	because I want to finish other things first
 HeikoS1	like all these descriptions
 sonney2k	Look at tester.py line 22 - inspired by http://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, then please do so yourself
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: ok
 HeikoS1	is that true for other types too?
 HeikoS1	no only floating point
 HeikoS1	pok
 sonney2k	yes only floating point
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, so float32,float64,floatmax_t
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, that was the reason we had failing integration tests on osx
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I see, well spotted then
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, took me quite a while to figure that out...
 HeikoS1	Ill make it an intro task
 HeikoS1	I guess the comparison code should be in CMath
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, yeah it is a good one. This function could live in CMath
 sonney2k	exactly
 sonney2k	and SGVector / matrix could use it too
 sonney2k	etc
 HeikoS1	they do
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: equals is based on comparing element by element
 HeikoS1	ah you mean the vector->euqals method
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, yes
 sonney2k	vec.equals(other_vec)
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: this one has no accuracy
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, we should another function that has it then
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: see #1888 and 1889
 sonney2k	ok
 sonney2k	thx
 pickle27	sonney2k: its working thanks!
 pickle27	now to do some tweaking
 sonney2k	pickle27, show us some screen demo :D
 pickle27	yeah I'll push it later today

 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what about some d3 action for ryans project, would be a neat addition
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, ahh btw I think we can do the automated examples with jinja2 too - the same way like we do the clone etc tests
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, and the same way pickle27 is doing the  website :)
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: good idea, could you add that to the project description?
 HeikoS1	and add references to the code that does things already?
 sonney2k	HeikoS1, no we dont' have references
 sonney2k	just jinja2
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: well just point out that we generate automatic examples already
