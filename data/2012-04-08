 n4nd0	sonney2k: covertree sucks :(
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	slow?
 n4nd0	super slow
@sonney2k	hehe
 n4nd0	I am testing it with the files Sergey has sent
 n4nd0	I am just trying to classify 10 vectors
@sonney2k	so blackburn slowed everything down with covertrees :D
 n4nd0	the old KNN method takes about 2 second
@sonney2k	*lol*
 n4nd0	with covertree ... it's not finishing ...
 n4nd0	more than a minute now
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, edrt stuff is faster with covertree
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you precompute distance matrix there?
 n4nd0	blackburn: any problem with cover trees for high dimensions?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, it depends only on distance
 blackburn	some intrinsic dimensionality stuff is here
 blackburn	however it is not of interest there I think
 n4nd0	I don't know
 n4nd0	but I think that even the covertree impl. we are using is not super good
 n4nd0	this result is weird
 blackburn	not weird
 blackburn	it computes all distances a few times
 blackburn	it is time demanding
 blackburn	however how long does it take to construct a tree?
 n4nd0	I am going to check that now
 blackburn	do you separate these processes?
 n4nd0	I think that the problem is there
 n4nd0	they are separate
 n4nd0	construction is in train
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	so how long train takes?
 n4nd0	I think that the operation that takes a life time is training
 n4nd0	it is not ending directly :)
 n4nd0	we are talking about a huge bunch of vectors though
 n4nd0	but does cover tree performance takes this into account?
 blackburn	it should be log N
 n4nd0	I mean, when they say that it is for KNN classification
 n4nd0	do they take into account construction?
 blackburn	no, construction is not considered there
 blackburn	you would need to construct it only once
 blackburn	n4nd0: I can say that knn (k=10) takes a hour or so to compute outputs with naive quick sort
 blackburn	on that data
 blackburn	all vectors I mean
 n4nd0	using 1000 vectors for training
 n4nd0	it took 13 seconds to construct the tree
 blackburn	and 2?
 blackburn	K
 n4nd0	k = 8
 n4nd0	apply takes more time :(
 blackburn	how much?
 n4nd0	two times more
 n4nd0	but the number of vectors is really small
 blackburn	actually this apply *can't* take more time than qsort one
 blackburn	I do not understand how can that be
 blackburn	qsort approach computes distances to each vector
 blackburn	and covertree computes a few
 n4nd0	it makes no sense with intuition but
 n4nd0	there must sth there
 n4nd0	I am going to try with more vectors fro apply
 n4nd0	500 for apply and 1000 for training
 n4nd0	I would expect here the cover tree
 n4nd0	not taking into account training
 blackburn	no need to take train time into account
 n4nd0	is a shit
 gsomix	good night
 n4nd0	sorry for the expression :P
 blackburn	nite
 n4nd0	gsomix: good night!

 blackburn	n4nd0: haha
 blackburn	okay 1000 apply?
 n4nd0	I can tell you
 n4nd0	6 sec with quick sort
 n4nd0	15 with cover bush
 blackburn	??!
 blackburn	15???
 n4nd0	just guessing
 n4nd0	want to make your bet?
 blackburn	it shouldn't be possible

 PhilTillet	Hmm, I can't find any knn c++ example, is there any?
 blackburn	no
 PhilTillet	that's why I can't find one :p
 n4nd0	I think that if we use covertree + opencl support
 blackburn	n4nd0: all is ok..
 blackburn	no
 n4nd0	maybe we can beat quick sort
 blackburn	n4nd0: nooooooo
 n4nd0	I was ironic / joking :)
 n4nd0	I think it must be an error in my integration in KNN
 blackburn	I just glanced over it
 blackburn	all seems to be ok
@sonney2k	no one beats my quicksort :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hahaha
@sonney2k	it is 100 times faster than qsort() from libc *lol*
 blackburn	sonney2k: wtf?
 blackburn	how can that be
 n4nd0	sonney2k: serious?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think you should tell them ...
 blackburn	100?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	not serious
@sonney2k	it is faster but not sure how much
 blackburn	why it is?
@sonney2k	it is because they do advances stuff
@sonney2k	advanced
@sonney2k	I don't
 n4nd0	that are never used?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just benchmark it ... maybe it got fixed by now
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what is your intuition about the cover tree?
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw you may use [:,:1000]
 blackburn	instead of range
 blackburn	range is a bad thing
 n4nd0	you think so?
 n4nd0	I actually changed :1000 to range
 blackburn	yes, range computes whole range
 blackburn	why?
 n4nd0	mmm I don't really know why
@sonney2k	I think they do quicksort first then switch to bubble for small bin sizes
 n4nd0	let's focus on doing a toolbox for sorting
 blackburn	n4nd0: what if you take say 10 features?
 n4nd0	blackburn: train or apply?
 blackburn	is covertree faster then?
 n4nd0	I guess you say for training
 blackburn	just truncate feature matrices
 blackburn	rows
 n4nd0	ah ok
 n4nd0	sorry
 n4nd0	I am trying first with the whole bunch of sample
 n4nd0	samples*
 n4nd0	but that may take a lot
 blackburn	it looks like we have shity covertree :)
 n4nd0	wow
 n4nd0	we are almost there

 n4nd0	100 training examples, 100000 test vectors
 n4nd0	using just 10 features
 blackburn	100000&
 blackburn	where did you get so many
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	haha
@sonney2k	ok then screw this cover tree - blackburn, gsomix get JL's to work
 n4nd0	blackburn: I did testdat[:10, :100000]
 n4nd0	blackburn: none complained :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I don't understand why it does not complain
 n4nd0	blackburn: testdat.shape = (580, 12630)
 blackburn	n4nd0: it cuts to 100000
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	okay LLE
 blackburn	so just takes all
 blackburn	with 4000 vectors
 blackburn	0.6s to compute neighborhood matrix
 blackburn	and with 8000 vector
 blackburn	1.58s
 blackburn	kind of wrong asymptotic...
 blackburn	fuck that
 blackburn	we really need proper covertree then
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay postpone this shit for now
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
 n4nd0	blackburn: fuck, I lost time doing the integration :(
 n4nd0	waste
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, interface is similar
 n4nd0	blackburn: at least :)
 blackburn	would be some patch rather than new reintegration
 blackburn	it works in that covertree_point_t way as well
 blackburn	n4nd0: gsomix actually was near to finish that
 blackburn	I hope he didn't delete that stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's see
 blackburn	okay time to got to bed
 n4nd0	blackburn: curiosity, do you remember what the author of this covertree said?
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm? that one we have?
 blackburn	I found that on github
 blackburn	I didn't contact him
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	time to sleep
 blackburn	but probably it is a problem
 blackburn	see you
 n4nd0	good night people!

 pluskid	I'm scanning some of your chatting logs last night
 pluskid	concerning cover tree, I accidently encounter this implementation the other day: https://github.com/mbrucher/CoverTree/
 pluskid	The author also has a blog post on this: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/eifelle/CPPV/~3/eN8ZuHOetUY/
 pluskid	Maybe you could compare with this implementation to identify where the problem is?

 pluskid	OK
 pluskid	I will fix it
@sonney2k	pluskid, yeah well znc :)
@sonney2k	thanks
@sonney2k	pluskid, if you can come up with some other small patches within the next weeks it would be helpful
 pluskid	OK, I see
 pluskid	I will try to find something to work on
@sonney2k	we don't know #slots yet but we will try to come up with some kind of pre-selection by the end of tomorrow
 pluskid	if I didn't find interesting small stuffs, I will come and ask here

 n4nd0	pluskid: but it is tru that it might because of the dataset
 pluskid	yes, it might be
 pluskid	but if it is the case
 pluskid	at least we could figure out cover tree is good for what kind of dataset
 pluskid	and document that
 n4nd0	I thought that if we use for our test any of the one referenced here
 n4nd0	http://hunch.net/~beygel/cover-tree.pdf
 n4nd0	on the last page
 n4nd0	cover tree should be better then
 pluskid	yes, that would be a good try
 pluskid	they used larger dataset
 pluskid	5000-point

 gsomix	blackburn, yo
 blackburn	gsomix: hi, I'll merge your stuff in a min
 blackburn	gsomix: as for covertree I have one suggestion
 blackburn	gsomix: did you delete your covertree modifications? I hope not
 gsomix	blackburn, I did not delete.
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	see KNN sources
 blackburn	actually all you would need
 blackburn	is to change block at KNN.cpp:113
 blackburn	where covertree is constructed
 gsomix	blackburn, do you mean KNN in shogun?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	and 426
 blackburn	where neighbors are enqueued
 gsomix	blackburn, and..?
 blackburn	gsomix: hmm my suggestion is to use your adopted covertree there :)
 pluskid	blackburn: hi, what's the status of regression support in shogun?
 pluskid	it seems incomplete?
 blackburn	as we measured some stuff and it turns that dncrane's covertree is rather slow
 blackburn	pluskid: in which means?
 pluskid	for example
 pluskid	why train_machine() in LinearRidgeRegression protected?
 pluskid	and LeastSquareRegression is almost empty ?
 blackburn	pluskid: in shogun machines train delegates all the stuff to virtual protected train_machine()
 blackburn	oh I see
 pluskid	I mean, when a method is protected, it cannot be invoked by others
 blackburn	train can
 blackburn	that's ok
 pluskid	oh, train invokes train_machine ?
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	ok
 blackburn	ahah
 blackburn	got it
 blackburn	pluskid: that's ok with leastsquares
 blackburn	it is LinearRidge with tau = 0
 pluskid	got it :)

 pluskid	n4nd0: OK, I'm starting on this
 pluskid	btw: Lapack and blas is really hard to use ...
 n4nd0	you think so?
 n4nd0	I am not an expert but I managed to make it work for the couple of things I have used it around here
 blackburn	I don't think it is :)
 pluskid	haven't got familiar with it yet
 pluskid	doing something like matrix multiple
 pluskid	and solving linear system
 pluskid	makes me headache
 n4nd0	matrix multiple?
 pluskid	C = A * B this easy
 n4nd0	ah ok multiplication ;)
 pluskid	ah, yeah
 pluskid	maybe I need some time to get familiar with its naming convention
 pluskid	it could be better if their doc are supplied with examples
 n4nd0	now that we are talking about it
 pluskid	for example
 pluskid	in a function for multiplication of two matrices
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is the main difference between lapack and BLAS?
 blackburn	n4nd0: BLAS is basic ops
 n4nd0	I think that lapack includes BLAS but I am not sure about it
 blackburn	like Ax=b
 pluskid	Lapack built on BLAS
 blackburn	and Lapack is solving/etc
 blackburn	eigenproblems
 blackburn	factorization
 blackburn	svd
 blackburn	etc
 pluskid	they provide options to indicate that one of the matrix is transposed or not
 blackburn	BLAS is all about three levels
 blackburn	vector-vector operations
 blackburn	like dot
 pluskid	and you have to indicate the shape (dimension) of the matrix
 blackburn	that is Level 1
 pluskid	but I don't know whether the shape should be before transpose or after...
 blackburn	matrix-vector operations
 blackburn	Level 2
 n4nd0	and matrix-matrix level 3
 n4nd0	:)

 n4nd0	pluskid: I think that options are actually to change the operations like
 n4nd0	pluskid: if you want to do A*v or A'*v you use the same function but you use an option for that
 shogun-buildbot	build #654 of cmdline_static is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/654  blamelist: heiko.strathmann@gmail.com
 pluskid	n4nd0: yes, but in the function, you have to pass the shape (m * n) of A
 blackburn	pluskid: in the doc they say that sizes are of Op(A)
 blackburn	so Op(A) is A or A'
 pluskid	if A is transposed, shall I pass m, n or n, m ?
 pluskid	OK
 n4nd0	pluskid: I'd say you pass those parameters before transposed
 pluskid	I'll read the doc again
 pluskid	didn't find the detailed doc before blackburn gave me that link
 n4nd0	pluskid: I have been using this one too http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Level-2-GSL-BLAS-Interface.html
 pluskid	blackburn: you are right, I should use size of Op(A)
 pluskid	n4nd0: according to the doc, we should use the size *after* transposed :)

 pluskid	n4nd0: the API of GSL-BLAS seems slightly different from what we are using?
 blackburn	yeah totally different
 pluskid	it seems GSL is doing some more wrapping
 pluskid	while the package we are using is straightforward fortran translation
 blackburn	no we are tied to basic API
 blackburn	it would stay the same for scalapck
 blackburn	or cuda lapack
 blackburn	or any other lapack
 blackburn	it is standard api while gsl's is not
 pluskid	OK, I see

 n4nd0	benchmarking cover tree with letter subset ...
 n4nd0	in the paper on cover trees they say cover tree should be about ten times faster here
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw I checked things
 blackburn	and in my LLE implementation
 blackburn	covertree is 3-4 times faster than quicksort
 blackburn	on a range 4K - 8K 3d vectors
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	something fishy going on here then
 n4nd0	it sucks
 n4nd0	>>>>> Classification with quick sort took 51.0038590431
 n4nd0	>>>>> Cover tree construction took 99.7238249779
 n4nd0	>>>>> Classification with cover tree took 106.712816
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: actually gsomix is on the way to integrate JL's
 n4nd0	that is with 10000 vectors for training and classifcation
 n4nd0	but I don't understand why is it faster with your tests
 n4nd0	I am afraid I may have done something wrong :S
 blackburn	no I don't think so
 blackburn	pluskid measured distance evaluations and it is computed too often
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	it needs to compute distances quite often to apply queries too

 pluskid	do you see JL's reply in the mailing list?
 blackburn	did he reply??
 blackburn	can't see anything
 pluskid	yes
 n4nd0	no, I don't
 pluskid	he said:
 pluskid	Can you compute the expansion constant spectrum as in the original
 pluskid	covertree paper?
 blackburn	did he answer directly?
 blackburn	expansion constant spectrum? wtf?
 pluskid	he replied to shogun-list
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	shouldn't it be here http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun?
 pluskid	I don't know
 pluskid	maybe the gmane archive has delay
 pluskid	he replied 3 hours ago
 pluskid	if you subscribed to the mailing list
 n4nd0	didn't get in my inbox either
 pluskid	you should receive one in your inbox
 blackburn	haha
 n4nd0	yeah, I am subscribed
 blackburn	yeah I have subscribed recently
 pluskid	strange
 pluskid	anyway
 blackburn	year ago or so
 blackburn	:D
 pluskid	that's what he said
 pluskid	though I don't understand
 pluskid	I haven't read the paper
 blackburn	can you paste 'To'?
 pluskid	To: Chiyuan Zhang <pluskid@gmail.com>
 pluskid	Cc: shogun-list@shogun-toolbox.org
 pluskid	shogun-list doesn't accept CC?
 blackburn	it does
 pluskid	who implemented our current cover tree? maybe we can ask him what is the expansion constant spectrum?
 n4nd0	well, I think the cover tree is taken from somewhere else
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	blackburn: you mentioned that gsomix  is merging JL's ?
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	so JL has an official implementation now?
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	cool
 pluskid	maybe we could wait to see what about that one
 n4nd0	yes
 pluskid	since none of us know the internal of how cover tree works
 n4nd0	I just wanted to check whether the test data was affecting
 blackburn	JL's one is better anyway
 pluskid	is JL's implementation publicly available now?
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	I think we should at least reply him in the mail
 blackburn	yes could you please?
 pluskid	sure
 blackburn	because we can't see the email :D
 pluskid	maybe the mail arrived at my inbox because he also sent to me
 pluskid	and the shogun-list is super slow
 pluskid	maybe
 blackburn	yes could be
 n4nd0	pluskid: in his web-page there is an implementation of isomap that includes cover tree
 pluskid	I would say one of us is porting JL's implementation now, if we still have problem with his implementation, we will contact him to try to figure out the problem
 blackburn	pluskid: yes thanks
 pluskid	n4nd0: cool, he is still updating his Isomap code!
 n4nd0	pluskid: I think is another's guy isomap
 pluskid	n4nd0: ??
 pluskid	JL is one of the authors of Isomap
 n4nd0	pluskid: look under application
 n4nd0	http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html
 n4nd0	another's guy isomap's implementation :)
 n4nd0	I don't really know if that sense makes sense using normal English
 n4nd0	but I think you got the idea, or?
 n4nd0	:D
 pluskid	Oh, I see
 pluskid	:D
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
 blackburn	one great thing about us is we are able to write some meanless things
 blackburn	while english is foreign for us :)
 pluskid	english foreign for me, too
 n4nd0	if some native speaker was here, he/she would probably get a headache :D
 pluskid	n4nd0: JL's page provided some dataset for cover tree testing, maybe you could try out your KNN on that
 blackburn	pluskid: yes we know :)
 blackburn	we have no native speakers there
 blackburn	at all
 pluskid	haha
 blackburn	the only active at the ML native speaker is Evan
 blackburn	we should consult him about language too as well as git :D
 pluskid	his IRC id is ?
 blackburn	I've never seen him there
 n4nd0	me neither
 blackburn	pluskid: is it true there is no first/last name separation in china?
 pluskid	not ture
 pluskid	but the first/last is reversed
 blackburn	so Zhang is a?
 pluskid	actually, I'm always confused
 pluskid	I'd rather prefer given name vs. family name
 pluskid	Zhang is family name, Chiyuan is given name
 blackburn	aha! I see
 pluskid	English people write Chiyuan Zhang
 pluskid	but in China, we always use Zhang Chiyuan
 blackburn	we tend to reverse that stuff too
 blackburn	in russian
 pluskid	I don't know which one is first which is last...
 blackburn	last name is family name I think :)
 blackburn	we also make use of patronymes there
 blackburn	that's why "o" letter is in my email address
 blackburn	pluskid: my brother works for huawei there
 pluskid	cool!
 pluskid	huawei is a big company in China
 blackburn	yeah
 pluskid	biggest local network device company according to my knowledge
 blackburn	not only local afaik
 blackburn	even backbones are constructed with huawei equipment
 pluskid	wow
 blackburn	actually they have beaten cisco here I think
 blackburn	biggest mobile operator, megafon, uses mainly huawei stuff
 pluskid	here ? means where?
 blackburn	russia
 pluskid	wow!
 pluskid	I didn't know they have made such achievements
 n4nd0	they have two very big countries then
 pluskid	can't find "patronymes" in my dictionary
 blackburn	pluskid: hmm we include father's name
 n4nd0	I think they say patronymic
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	probably my bad
 pluskid	Oh, I see now
 blackburn	n4nd0: are your middle names related to your family's members?
 blackburn	:)
 pluskid	so where are you from n4nd0 ?
 n4nd0	pluskid: Spain, resident in Sweden
 n4nd0	blackburn: they are, but it is just a choice
 n4nd0	I mean, some people say like I will call my son with my father's name
 blackburn	n4nd0: so Jos? is your father's name?
 n4nd0	but we don't use patronyms or matronyms
 n4nd0	blackburn: no, Jos? is the masculin for my grandmother's name
 blackburn	oooh
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn: Fernando is my godfather's
 pluskid	haha, I heard that in some restaurant at Spain, people can use some kind of Chinese dialect to order dishes :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: what about third one then?
 n4nd0	pluskid: probably is they way in which we would speak Chinese :P
 n4nd0	blackburn: well Iglesias and Garc?a are just surnames, my father's family name and my mother's
 blackburn	ah!
 pluskid	but that kind of dialect is very different from our official language, actually, I totally can't understand
 pluskid	complicated name system!
 n4nd0	pluskid: aham, it sounds something more serious then what you are talking about
 pluskid	IRC IDs would be enough :p
 pluskid	there are many many dialects in Southern China
 blackburn	pluskid: from which part of chinae you are?
 blackburn	china*
 pluskid	around Western
 pluskid	previously I thought many here would be Germany :)
 pluskid	as shogun is originally developed from MPI, am I right?
 blackburn	pluskid: well yes
 blackburn	Soeren is from Berlin
 pluskid	blackburn: if you are in Russia, you must be in some similar timezone as me
 blackburn	pluskid: wow, why?
 blackburn	we have 9 timezones :D
 pluskid	er...
 pluskid	we are using a unified timezone in china
 pluskid	everywhere is Beijin time
 pluskid	GMT+8...
 blackburn	western one is kaliningrad - GMT+1
 pluskid	big difference
 blackburn	and eastern is some kamchatka GMT+9 probably
 blackburn	let me check
 shogun-buildbot	build #486 of octave_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/486
 pluskid	never mind
 pluskid	so what's your local time now?
 pluskid	it's 23:54 here
 blackburn	19/55
 blackburn	19.55
 blackburn	I'm in GMT+3 timezone
 blackburn	or +4?
 blackburn	:D
 pluskid	hmm, quite different
 n4nd0	17:55 here
 pluskid	so you use a dot to separate time in Russia?
 pluskid	n4nd0: even earlier
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	both are ok I think :)
 blackburn	: or .
 pluskid	hmm
 blackburn	and kaliningrad is +3
 blackburn	I was wrong
 blackburn	okay anadyr is +12
 blackburn	8 timezones still
 blackburn	would be bad to have night at say 14:30 and day at 3:30 :)

 wiking	:D
 gsomix	blackburn_, ???
 wiking	anyhow i have to test now mkl :>
 wiking	blackburn_: any suggestions which mkl to use for multi class case?
 blackburn_	mkl? whoa that's nice :D
 blackburn_	I do not know anything about mkl :D
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	i'll have to try how it works for me
 wiking	i have 3 different sets of features
 wiking	and seems like a good idea
 wiking	to use different kernels for different feature sets
 blackburn_	yeah may be
 wiking	since i've tried it with only concatenating all the features
 wiking	but i wonder if it really makes a big difference
 wiking	if i use mkl
 wiking	i guess it should :P
 blackburn_	I think it depends whether they have rather different structure
 wiking	yeah they doo
 wiking	one of it is a very sparse feature set... that is coming from text processing
 wiking	while the other is like a histogram feature from images
 wiking	until now what i've done is to concatenate them l2-norm them and then use polykernel
 wiking	and as we know using intersection or jensen shannon kernel for those histogram features are giving me better results...
 blackburn_	in my experience it is not very good to use any dot product on histograms
 wiking	yeah...
 wiking	so i'm thinking about now the mkl
 wiking	but i guess the only way to see the outcome is to actually try it :>>>
 wiking	just quite lazy
 blackburn_	what about structured output latent model multiple kernel learning svm?
 blackburn_	:D
 wiking	well
 wiking	that'd be amazng
 wiking	:D
 wiking	i wonder where's alex
 wiking	i guess he is taking his easter holidays...
 blackburn_	wiking: afaik it uses gmnp
 wiking	blackburn_: yeah i've just checked the code
 wiking	i mean the headers...
 blackburn_	while gmnp is very good it should be nice too
 wiking	well i guess now it's time for me to do the coding
 wiking	the reading in the various features
 wiking	and then do the setting up of the mkl
 wiking	and see what i get
 wiking	;)
 wiking	ok i need to switch to vpn

 wiking	they've managed to merge it now like 2 days ago....

 wiking	and it was like a 5 liner patch... nothing serious ... :(

* gsomix hates photometrics stuff.
@sonney2k	ahh nice and quiet :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, at home? in chat?
@sonney2k	at home
@sonney2k	:)
@sonney2k	kids are asleep and I am going to shogun mode now :)
 gsomix	^_^
@sonney2k	gsomix, I see that you patch got merged already? so did you have time to think about what to do next?
@sonney2k	I mean your preferences?
 gsomix	sonney2k, I want to work on SG_Vector.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok - so then first thing to do is to convert everything from returning copies of SGVector to references
@sonney2k	i.e. functions doing SGVector foo() should be SGVector& foo()
@sonney2k	same for input arguments
 blackburn_	INTRUSIVE
@sonney2k	next step is then to just copy & paste the ref/unref code from SGObject
@sonney2k	HIGHLY INTRUSIVE
@sonney2k	blackburn_, that is why we should do this ASAP
 blackburn_	sonney2k: ah that is kind of painful
 blackburn_	penetration lol
@sonney2k	blackburn_, it is not as bad as last years double* -> SGVector transition though
 blackburn_	sonney2k: what about typemaps?
@sonney2k	gsomix, then the next step would be to remove destroy_vector / etc
 blackburn_	any changes are required?
@sonney2k	blackburn_, yes sure add a &
 blackburn_	nothing more?
@sonney2k	gsomix, and to go through all the code and use the SG_REF / UNREF macro on sgvectors
 blackburn_	gsomix: what about covertree? :)
@sonney2k	that is sth we probably all have to help
@sonney2k	blackburn_, isn't pluskid working on this?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: no
 gsomix	blackburn_, in spare time.
 blackburn_	gsomix: ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: he's focusing on LARS I think
 blackburn_	yes
 n4nd0	I can work on cover tree if it is ok
 blackburn_	huh
 blackburn_	:D
 blackburn_	why not
 n4nd0	I don't think I am doing so much with the testsuite
 blackburn_	gsomix: can you introduce your pretty ready work to n4nd0 ?
 gsomix	blackburn_, yep. But it's a little ugly. ^_^''

 gsomix	n4nd0, many functions and global variables. And some stuff for v_array.
 n4nd0	gsomix: what is the implementation based on? JL's paper or another implementation?
 gsomix	n4nd0, JL code.
 gsomix	*JL's
 n4nd0	the one here right? http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html
 n4nd0	first link after the enumerate with 3 points
 gsomix	n4nd0, yep. templated version.
 n4nd0	gsomix: ok
 gsomix	n4nd0, I even think it's better to start anew.
 n4nd0	gsomix: oh, do you think so?
 gsomix	it's seems my code contains errors.
 blackburn_	gsomix: can you remember any pitfalls you have struggled with?
 gsomix	blackburn_, yep.
 gsomix	it's related with differences in v_arrays, our ans JC's.

 n4nd0	gsomix: what did you do more or less? take the methods in JL's code and add template for the point object
 n4nd0	more changes?
-!- blackburn_ [5bde8018@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.222.128.24] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 gsomix	n4nd0, and formatting. :)
 gsomix	n4nd0, there are little changes to our v_array support.
 n4nd0	gsomix: and what's the problem of this implementation?
 gsomix	n4nd0, memory leaks.
 gsomix	in push and alloc
 n4nd0	gsomix: ok
 n4nd0	but for the rest, is it functional?
 n4nd0	I mean, is it complete?
 gsomix	n4nd0, iirc, yes.
 n4nd0	gsomix: cool then
@sonney2k	well ask John Langford about the leaks then (with some small example code)
 gsomix	n4nd0, maybe I'm wrong. Just try to run.
 n4nd0	gsomix: ok, I will take a look to understand a bit how it works and later run
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is it v_array better than std::vector too? :)
@sonney2k	I am not a big fan of any std:: stuff .... simply because std::vector is not even specified to be something contiguous etc
@sonney2k	so *everything* is better :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, I will start to work tomorrow.
 gsomix	At now it's time to optics. :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, you mean on shogun or some job :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am a big fan of STL but you are starting to make me doubt about it :O
 gsomix	sonney2k, shogun, of course.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, maybe I am just not knowledgeable enough about it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have never analyzed its efficiency to tell the truth, I think that's the part you critize about it
 blackburn	actually it is as well efficient afaik
 n4nd0	criticize*
@sonney2k	blackburn, where is it specified that vector is contiguous in memory?
 blackburn	it is not probably however that does not implies it is very uncontiguous :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: why wouldn't it be contiguous?
 blackburn	n4nd0: because of resize
 blackburn	hmm however some says it is
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/672352/how-is-dynamic-memory-managed-in-stdvector
 n4nd0	blackburn: this v_array class we have in shogun, have you worked with it?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah had used it somewhere.. any problem?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, for example the method pop
 n4nd0	inline T pop() { return *(--end); }
 n4nd0	shouldn't be a check around there?
 blackburn	it isnot safe :)
 n4nd0	because it is meant to be so?
 gsomix	sonney2k, can I ask you? :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, please always ask - not ask if you can ask!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well speed trade off
@sonney2k	checks cost quite a bit of performance when you do them *often*
 gsomix	sonney2k, it's offtop. :) what have you studied in your minor/major courses at the university?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah it tries to be as fast as it could be
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, well major: computer science, minor: physics
 blackburn	I never knew you studied physics :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, thanks. :) do you like physics?
@sonney2k	gsomix, back then yes - now I like machine learning and traffic :D
 gsomix	I have major in applied math and physics. It's long.
 gsomix	I cut up to "physics" in my proposal :)
 gsomix	because blackburn is more a mathematician than I. :3
@sonney2k	alright guess I've requested 8 slots for gsoc (I think we really have 8 very very good students that applied) and 9 if there was an inf amount of slots available
@sonney2k	spare time for me now!
* sonney2k goes watching the revision demo party live stream
 blackburn	demoscene memories? ;)
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	I am too old :D
@sonney2k	I mean I went to 'scene' parties since 1993 or so
 blackburn	sonney2k: really? I was 2 :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: I doubled your age at that time :P
 gsomix	now it is clear how the CPU Fire Applet appeared. demoscene! :)
 blackburn	yeah kind of
 blackburn	lorenz stuff as well I guess
 n4nd0	is any of you guys fan of topcoder or programming contests in general?
 n4nd0	just curious
 blackburn	oh I do not like that stuff pretty much :)
 gsomix	n4nd0, just codeforces (russian analog). but I'm not very good in sports programming.
 n4nd0	I think it is quite fun :)
 n4nd0	but kind of difficult, lot of good people around there
@sonney2k	yeah I wrote lorenz at a demoscene party :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: my main point is that these guys can hardly fit to real programming
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes...
 gsomix	n4nd0, http://codeforces.ru/?locale=en this system differs from topcoder. five tasks, two hours.
 n4nd0	gsomix: I have participated in codeforces ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is also the reason I know the uint and int operations have same costs
 gsomix	n4nd0, ah :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I know that
@sonney2k	and all that low level assembly programming stuff
@sonney2k	anyways have a nice evening

 PhilTillet	blackburn, what did you mean with "May be it would be better to use matrix there and then construct features" ?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: you construct features from matrix and then enqueue its feature vectors
 blackburn	why not to construct matrix and then construct features?
 PhilTillet	Okay, I'll do that
