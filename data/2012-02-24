 karlnapf	sonney2k, around?
 karlnapf	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	hello
 blackburn	yes
 karlnapf	hi
 karlnapf	how is it going?
 blackburn	fine, what about you?
 karlnapf	same here :)
 karlnapf	very busy
 blackburn	yeah, feel the same sometimes
 blackburn	karlnapf: yesterday we have discussed ideas with soeren
 karlnapf	ah nice
 blackburn	you probably better to check logs
 karlnapf	was about asking about that
 karlnapf	will do
 karlnapf	many new things?
 blackburn	no, no new things at all I'd say
 blackburn	I am going to do multitask learning, you know?
 karlnapf	wow, nice one :)
 karlnapf	I had some lectures by massi pontil about that
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	I don't know much about it yet
 blackburn	:)
 karlnapf	me neither, just the lecture, havent studied it so well yet, but its probably a nice thing and very recent
 blackburn	I checked your part and it is pretty complex as well
 karlnapf	the mmd/HSIC?
 blackburn	yeah no idea what it means but probably ys
 karlnapf	these are really nice things in my eyes
 karlnapf	I hope I will do my Master project also about this
 karlnapf	About kernel selection for these things
 blackburn	master? I though you are phd..
 blackburn	I'm going to do my bachelor project about road sign recognition
 karlnapf	no, I am a Master student, hopefully phd in autumn :)
 blackburn	ah last year masters?
 karlnapf	nice, so lots of image recognition stuff
 blackburn	I see
 karlnapf	its a one year program here
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	hmm something is wrong with svmocas
 blackburn	just got 16% accuracy
 blackburn	:D
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	thats not good
 blackburn	while liblinear was 96%
 karlnapf	I have beed fiddeling around with multiclass svm recently
 karlnapf	multiclassMKL also
 blackburn	yeah I'm doing multiclass as well
 karlnapf	and I think shogun desparetely needs sigmoid fitting (also for multiclass)
 karlnapf	oh ok.
 blackburn	why not to use genuine multiclass svms?
 karlnapf	I have a lot of changes in my local repo, will commit when I find some time
 karlnapf	whats that?
 blackburn	like gmnpsvm
 blackburn	no need to do sigmoid fitting
 karlnapf	ah
 karlnapf	mmh
 blackburn	takes a lot of time to train though
 karlnapf	well, but users may want to have probs for standard svm
 blackburn	ah
 karlnapf	really? Just wrote some code for it
 blackburn	I thought you mean different thing
 karlnapf	works pretty fine
 karlnapf	ah ok
 karlnapf	I also implemented it for one-against-one svms
 karlnapf	Results are nice
 blackburn	one against one?
 karlnapf	When we discussed about how to integrate it into shogun I will do
 karlnapf	yes for multiclass svm
 blackburn	I don't like OvO :)
 blackburn	had 903 svms here
 karlnapf	one against one currently only has this vote stuff
 blackburn	43*42/2
 karlnapf	oh :)
 karlnapf	well thats probably not feasible
 karlnapf	but if its used, its nice to have prob as output
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	let me describe what I meant
 karlnapf	go ahead :)
 blackburn	when you do some OvR or OvO
 blackburn	scaling can vary much
 blackburn	and it is not fitted very well
 blackburn	so both vojtech and soeren told me it depends on such scaling
 blackburn	that's why gmnpsvm and larank works better
 karlnapf	ah ok
 karlnapf	how does it work, whats the output/input?
 blackburn	what is 'it'?
 blackburn	both gmnp and larank is OvR
 blackburn	but it trains like genuine multiclass svm
 karlnapf	mmh ok
 karlnapf	I have got to do some reading on this stuff
 blackburn	\sum_k ||w_k|| + C \sum_{i \ne k} \sum_j \xi_i^j
 karlnapf	I am currently facing a problem with 4 classes
 karlnapf	I would love to have a multi class MKL machine which output probabilities for this
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	do you find MKL useful?
 karlnapf	kind of like the idea
 karlnapf	my problem is from bioinformatics
 blackburn	ah
 karlnapf	I have two kernels: one based on biochemical data, and one based only on sequence oinformation
 blackburn	I was curious if it is applicable to not bio data
 karlnapf	And the kernel weights would give me a kind of measure how important the features are
 karlnapf	MMhh, dont really know
 karlnapf	but I like combining kernels
 blackburn	there was one nice guy here in irc,  he wrote HomogeneousKernelMap preprocessor
 blackburn	interesting stuff
 karlnapf	cool ,will check it out :)
 blackburn	maps features to linear space
 blackburn	where dot product is a kernel
 blackburn	explicitly I mean
 karlnapf	which dimension?
 blackburn	x3
 blackburn	more -> better
 blackburn	but x3 is sufficient
 karlnapf	kk
 blackburn	I lose only 0.5% of accuracy
 blackburn	but linear
 blackburn	making me possible to use liblinear with 3m train time
 blackburn	instead of libsvm with 6h :)
 karlnapf	year
 karlnapf	liblinear is so fucking fast
 blackburn	svmocas is faster
 blackburn	but I am afraid of its results now
 karlnapf	btw I currently can reproduce a segfault using it (with modelselection) will try to fix that these days
 blackburn	you were pretty active last month
 blackburn	:)
 karlnapf	yes, want to integrate everythign I am using/doing here into shogun
 blackburn	in fact I think you should have write rights..
 karlnapf	especially for model, there is lots of stuff to do
 karlnapf	well, I dont care much about this, also, the time I invest varies a lot
 blackburn	same here
 blackburn	I have been doing nothing about development since january I guess
 karlnapf	Think its ok, its opensource, youre not paid for this :)
 blackburn	yeah
 karlnapf	I think youre doing great stuff here anyway :)
 blackburn	but gsoc is paid so going to be active this summer
 blackburn	:D
 karlnapf	yes, ineed :)
 karlnapf	blackburn, I have some work to do so will leave now
 karlnapf	see you later
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	see yah
 blackburn	ya
 blackburn	:)
 karlnapf	:)
 karlnapf	bye
@sonney2k	karlnapf, hi - yes
 karlnapf	sonney2k, hi, I was about leaving now, just wanted to hear about the gsoc stuff, but talked a bit with blackburn and read yesterdays channel log
 blackburn	sonney2k: gmnpsvm (JS kernel) 97.14%, liblinear (OvR,JS) 96.00%
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I just updated the webpage
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok cool, will have a look, btw did you talk to arthur?
 blackburn	hmm a little different features
@sonney2k	blackburn, already model selected?
 blackburn	well same C
@sonney2k	karlnapf, no
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem - I had 16% with svmocas
 blackburn	I am afraid it is broken
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh I guess we introduced a bug at some point :(
-!- axitkhurana [~akshit@180.149.49.231] has joined #shogun
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok, have to go now, see you
 blackburn	I fixed one before
@sonney2k	karlnapf, regarding arthur
@sonney2k	is it OK if I put him as mentor?
@sonney2k	I think it makes sense...
 karlnapf	sonney2k, I have asked him, but he is quite busy currently. I think he will agree and it makes sense. Will see him next week and then ask
@sonney2k	karlnapf, yes ICMl deadline today
 karlnapf	exactly ;)
 karlnapf	ok, bye then
@sonney2k	karlnapf, cu!
 blackburn	sonney2k: anyway, with gmnp I had 97.32% with HIK and 97.14% with HIK approximation with that homogay kernel map
 blackburn	so I'd say it is pretty nice thing
@sonney2k	basically all the same
 blackburn	yes, so it is pretty good approximation

 blackburn	sonney2k: I did rejects in very simple way
 blackburn	just with thresholding I get 99% accuracy among non-rejected images
 blackburn	pretty nice for me :)
