 sonne|work	pluskid: I was just reading your patch thx!
 sonne|work	pluskid: to get the idea - you introduce multiclassstrategy that can be attached to any multiclass classifier and will generate configurations to be learned by some binary classifier / same with evaluation
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	sonne|work, yes
 sonne|work	pluskid: that makes a lot of sense - only thing that might be confusing to users is that we have *true* multiclass machines
 pluskid	sonne|work, the motivation is that blackburn suggest me to write a tree-structure training strategy
 sonne|work	like KNN that will directly do everything
 pluskid	sonne|work, yes, like many MulticlassSVM
 pluskid	they handle training directly
 sonne|work	I think we have only one multiclass svm - GMNP
 sonne|work	libsvmmulticlass is also doing OvO
 pluskid	maybe LaRank?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	true
-!- emrecelikten [~Anubis@176.40.232.233] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	I think either way (the old and the new) of handling multiclass strategy is OK, if we only have OvO and OvR
 pluskid	but if we want to introduce more, this way is more convenient
 pluskid	especially when we want to attach some more data to the strategy
 pluskid	for example, in a tree-structure training, we need the user to define a tree and attach that to the strategy object
 sonne|work	pluskid: no your way is much better
 sonne|work	I mean you should read the ECOC JMLR paper / code
 sonne|work	there are so many strategies to do so it is much nicer the new way
 pluskid	hmm, you are right
 sonne|work	pluskid: only thing I don't know is how to make clear in the class hierarchy that we have true multiclass machines
 sonne|work	not requiring any of this
 pluskid	yes, and training and applying can also be separated
 sonne|work	yeah only training is true multiclass for many 'true' multiclass machines
 pluskid	some machines use their own training, but use the generic strategy for applying
 sonne|work	yeah
 sonne|work	not clear how to handle that yet
 sonne|work	pluskid: anyway the best way to proceed is to implement other ECOC schemes from the paper - things will become clear then
 sonne|work	pluskid: btw I added some (minor) comments to your patch - please address them and then it is ok to be merged
 pluskid	sonne|work, yes, practicing is the best teacher :p
 pluskid	OK, I'll look at them

 pluskid	sonne|work, blackburn I updated the pull request
 blackburn	yes thanks
 blackburn	pluskid: have you seen ECOC training code in scikits learn?
 pluskid	blackburn, no
 blackburn	pluskid: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/multiclass.py
 blackburn	looks pretty easy actually
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	I think I understand the basics
 pluskid	after reading its comments
 blackburn	pluskid: yes rather easy - I am also having some long discussion with v. franc about training ECOC svm in true multiclass fashion
 pluskid	what does that mean? "in true multiclass fashion"
 blackburn	pluskid: in one optimization problem
 blackburn	implies better normalization
 pluskid	OK
 blackburn	pluskid: I mean in basic ECOC with given K bits
 blackburn	you would need to construct K classifiers
 pluskid	yes
 blackburn	right?
 pluskid	so you train the K classifiers in one time?
 blackburn	I've been thinking about SVM (looks like SO at some place)
 blackburn	actually I'd like to construct K classifier for each class
 blackburn	however K classifiers at the same time would work too may be
 pluskid	K classifier for each class?
 blackburn	hmm yes if I didn't get crazy
 pluskid	I didn't quite get you, so e.g. we have C class, K bits, then we have CK classifiers
 pluskid	with a test point x, how do we classify it?
 blackburn	max_{c\in C} \sum_{k\in K} <w_c^k, x>
 blackburn	does it make sense for you?
 blackburn	I am unsure already
 blackburn	:D
 pluskid	let me think
 blackburn	it is not ECOC :D
 blackburn	daaamn I have to think about it
 pluskid	no, this has nothing to do with ECOC
 pluskid	ordinary one-vs-rest linear machine, haha
 pluskid	move the sum inside the inner product
 blackburn	not ovr
 blackburn	composition of K OvR - useless
 pluskid	hmm, but you can move the sum into the inner product, then \sum_{k\in K}w_c^k can be treated as a single w_c
 blackburn	ah right
 blackburn	pluskid: no, decision rule is wrong
 pluskid	blackburn, why?
 blackburn	should be
 pluskid	I don't understand
 blackburn	should be different I mean
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	pluskid: nevermind this time
 pluskid	:)

 pluskid	hope build-bot is happy with my patches, though I have already checked locally
 sonne|work	pluskid: I hope so too :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: how many exams left?
 blackburn	sonne|work: 3
 blackburn	sonne|work: but they are not related with optics
 blackburn	so I am available
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	haha
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you think I should ask SLEP guys to GPL their code under their copyright?
 sonne|work	blackburn: I think we should do the intrusive renaming changes rather soon
 blackburn	sonne|work: which ones?
 sonne|work	blackburn: like moving around multiclass classifiers
 sonne|work	and multitask / domainadaptation stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: I still think multitask normalizers are better suited to be in transfer/multitask..
 sonne|work	then the only remaining intrusive stuff for this year is IMHO sgvector
 sonne|work	maybe but the should be totally hidden from the user
 blackburn	sonne|work: but what to rename?

 blackburn	happiness again
 sonne|work	blackburn: look at python_modular
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes
 blackburn	I'll fix once I get home
 blackburn	sonne|work: I think that's ok to patch true multiclass machines
 blackburn	to avoid this error we can add trained flag there
 blackburn	so once we train machine we store number of classes
 sonne|work	blackburn: just think of doing x-validation with Mc machines
 blackburn	what is the problem?
 sonne|work	for some subsets you observer x for some x-1 classes or less
 sonne|work	same problem with sparse features btw
 sonne|work	there could be 1000 dims or 100
 wiking	hey
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	that is the reason to train on different number of classes?
 blackburn	no sense for me at all
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn: you said you want to *infer* number of classes based on labels
 sonne|work	that is dangerous
 blackburn	yes train labels should contain all possible classes
 sonne|work	I think specifying nr classes is better
 sonne|work	blackburn: why should they?
 sonne|work	if you do x-val you might not have some classes
 blackburn	bad x-val
 sonne|work	not bad xval
 blackburn	but you will get wrong results!
 blackburn	sonne|work: how can you ignore some classes?
 blackburn	so if you skip class C you will have zero w_c, what makes you able to use it?
 blackburn	wiking: hey
 pluskid	I support specifying nr classes when constructing a classifier
 pluskid	just a matter of taste, however
 blackburn	pluskid: both ways are ok
 blackburn	however crossvalidation with class ignores makes no sense to me
 blackburn	things would be totally wrong if you skip some classes
 pluskid	I mean it would be easier to implement the code if we are given nr classes at first
 pluskid	then no need for a flag like m_trained or similar
 blackburn	pluskid: where is it set?
 pluskid	no in current code
 pluskid	but I think it might be needed
 blackburn	pluskid: yes that's I am asking
 blackburn	on which step?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	not in current?
 pluskid	for example, you do not know the number of machines, until it is trained
 blackburn	how does it work now
 blackburn	?
 pluskid	for example, in MulticlassMachine
 pluskid	get_num_machines()
 pluskid	will return "wrong" value, until the machine is actually trained
 pluskid	We need to know the state of the machine to see whether some "knowledge" is already available
 pluskid	here the number of classes
 pluskid	the same problem happens in MulticlassStrategy
 pluskid	MulticlassStrategy::get_num_machines(int32_t num_classes)
 pluskid	one has to pass num_classes as an argument when calling the function
 pluskid	but if we know num_classes from the begining, there's no need for this argument
 pluskid	anyway, I think it is just a matter of taste, coz the current solution also works
 blackburn	pluskid: I think we can assume no ties in labels while training
 blackburn	however it looks like it would be better to store number of classes on training
 blackburn	and obtain it while applying
 blackburn	this way you can be sure it works with ties in test set
 wiking	blackburn: ho :)
 blackburn	wiking: does it make sense to you to skip some classes in train set?
 blackburn	(that are not skipped in test one)
 wiking	??
 pluskid	blackburn, I'm OK with this solution
 wiking	blackburn: why would one do that?
 blackburn	wiking: x-val
 pluskid	though still prefer specifying nr classes in advance :p (my taste...)
 blackburn	pluskid: in advance?
 pluskid	I mean when constructing the classifier
 blackburn	when training or constructing?
 blackburn	pluskid: problem is that if you have ties in labels
 blackburn	like test set contains only 1,2, 4 instances
 blackburn	of classes 1,2,4
 blackburn	I mean
 blackburn	so get_num_classes would return 3
 blackburn	and you will run only 3 of 4 machines
 blackburn	skipping last one - it looks incorrect
 pluskid	I mean in the constructor
 pluskid	before training
 pluskid	what do you mean by "ties in labels"?
 blackburn	1,2,4
 blackburn	no 3
 blackburn	pluskid: but what if you set different labels?
 pluskid	but the number of labels won't change, will it?
 pluskid	number of classes
 blackburn	why not?
 blackburn	you can set features, kernel, labels - everything
 pluskid	You mean 1,2,4 or 2,3,4, or 1,2,3, etc?
 blackburn	just some missing class
 pluskid	OK
 pluskid	so we need set_num_classes, haha
 blackburn	pluskid: yes we need to save num of classes on training
 blackburn	we can't rely only on constructor - set_labels() would make no sense then
 pluskid	blackburn, OK, that makes sense
 blackburn	however this requires to set number of classes in strategy
 blackburn	in every true svm as well
 blackburn	true multiclass*
 pluskid	yes, that's the problem
 blackburn	not really
 blackburn	oneliner
 sonne|work	blackburn: I think that is the same issue like having a linear classifier operating on sparse features - sometimes not the last dim in any of the sparse feature vectors is non-zero so you need to specify length of w of the sparse classifier or so
 blackburn	sonne|work: are you still sure train set can contain a few classes?
 blackburn	(not all classes)
 sonne|work	sure
 blackburn	sonne|work: and how would you classify class X if you haven't trained a classifier for that?
 sonne|work	it will never predict class X but operate correctly otherwise
 blackburn	sonne|work: it broke other class' results
 blackburn	break*
 sonne|work	why?
 blackburn	sonne|work: hmm I assume it would be w=0
 sonne|work	exactly
 blackburn	sonne|work: it can override some other class scores
 blackburn	ah damn
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	0 always
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	okay sorry
 blackburn	<0,x>=0
 blackburn	sonne|work: it complicates things pretty much
 pluskid	I think if the samples for a class is missing, the problem is not with predicting, but with training. You need a one-class algorithm to train a "classifier" :D
 blackburn	pluskid: I am not even sure that would work with current algorithms
 blackburn	like gmnp/etc
 pluskid	however, if this happens, it should be an error
 pluskid	so if we are specified nr classes, we might be able to detect this kind of error
 pluskid	be back in a while
 blackburn	we need map there
 blackburn	to avoid any errors
 blackburn	we can't keep things like that anymore

 harshit_	ted__, hi ,I havn't had much experience with strings in shogun but i think you need to use CStringFeatures<char> as features .
 harshit_	ted__, have a look at examples/documented/libshogun/features_copy_subset_string_features

 harshit_	PhilTillet, haha ..

 harshit_	blackburn, I think there might me some issue with svmlin.cpp present in shogun, I have compared the results of original svmlin and that of shogun's, they are close but not exactly similar .
 harshit_	blackburn, have a look : http://snipt.org/uhjhh3
 blackburn	are all parameters equal?
 harshit_	blackburn, In svmlin original library we can set lambda so I set it to 1
 ted__	sonne|work, harshit_ : sorry, was away
 gsomix	harshit_, I think I'll drink vodka in the 17-18UTC and go to bed, aha
 harshit_	blackburn, but in shogun internaly lambda = 1/2c so I make value of C as 0.5
 blackburn	harshit_: but other params? are there any?
 harshit_	blackburn, only other parameter is epsilon which is 1e-5 in both
 ted__	Let's resume: I have samples of different sizes as vectors of float , I am looking for best shogun feature structure and kernel to train multiclass svm.
 ted__	I'll take a look at StringCharFeatures
 ted__	what about kernels ?
 blackburn	ted__: vectors of float?
 ted__	yes
 blackburn	of variable size?
 harshit_	gsomix, I think vodka is for blackburn, we should go for tequila !
 ted__	y
 blackburn	ted__: non-trivial.. how can you compare it?
 ted__	I know, I'm guessing stringkernel could do the work as they implement smthg like dtw distance ,
 ted__	?
 gsomix	harshit_, huh, I have never tried tequila.
 ted__	It can be vectors of int but sizes are different.
 harshit_	g2g, blackburn i'll do some more debugging and will let you know about the status !
 blackburn	harshit_: yeah thanks
 blackburn	ted__: yes makes sense but they are for more 'finite' features like char
 harshit_	gsomix, you should, maybe today !!
 ted__	blackburn: and I dont want to use simple bag-of-words representation
 blackburn	ted__: what is the nature of your features?
 ted__	blackburn: [w1,w2,w3,..] with w_iEUR[0..N] N could be 10, 100, 1000, or 10000
 ted__	and size of the "string" is not defined
 blackburn	ted__: have you any idea of similarility function? you can create custom kernel actually
 harshit_	ted__, what I think is that you should first use string to manipulate the words and then prepare its corresponding VSM model which you can store in a normal CSimpleFeatures
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@li381-56.members.linode.com] has joined #shogun
 ted__	harshit_: VSM ?
 harshit_	vector space model
 harshit_	in which you have words as features and documents as examples/datapoints
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.43.52] has left #shogun ["Leaving"]
 ted__	I thought that "string kernel" could handle features of different size ?
 blackburn	ted__: yes if they are contained with chars
 ted__	then clustered by [0,255] ?
 blackburn	yes would work
 ted__	Then it could be same algo for string of cluster indices (indices btw 0 and 1000..)
 ted__	Well, which shogun features/cluster could I overload if I want to do that ?
 blackburn	ted__: could you please clarify what exactly you need?
 ted__	Well, which shogun features/kernel could I overload if I want to do that ?
 blackburn	repeating sentence is not a clarification I'd say :D
 ted__	blackburn: sry, I just type cluster and meant kernel .
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	ted__: you don't really need to overload features for that
 ted__	blackburn: So. I have a set of indices vector of different size. Let's say Indices EUR [0,100]. Each vector is associated with a label. let's say we have 10 labels.

 ted__	blackburn: I want to train multiclass svm of this data. Problem is that features have different size.
-!- pluskid [~pluskid@li381-56.members.linode.com] has joined #shogun
 ted__	blackburn: indeed I have read about string kernel apply to string of char. I want to do the same with my problem.
 blackburn	ted__: you may try to construct StringFeatures<char> with your features
 blackburn	and use any kernel
 blackburn	string kernel I mean
 ted__	ok. And if I have more than 256 indices ?
 blackburn	ted__: you have vecotr x = [x1,x2,...] where xi \in [0,255]?
 blackburn	vector*
 blackburn	what do you mean more that 256 indices? wider range of xi values?
 ted__	blackburn: I have vector x = [x1,x2, ..] where xi \in [0,1000]
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.190.169] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	ted__: ok and what is the similarity measure you want to use?
 blackburn	I am asking because string kernel are mainly used by bioinformaticians to estimate similarities between some ACTCGCT and TCGCGA - not a big alphabet
 ted__	I know
@sonney2k	wiking,gsomix,pluskid,blackburn, do you have some homepage I could link to?
 blackburn	I haven't
 wiking	sonney2k: mmm not really :(
 wiking	but i'm planning to keep a weekly posting on maeth.com
 pluskid	sonney2k: http://pluskid.org
 wiking	but currently it's personal rampage :)
 gsomix	shogun-buildbot, nope
 gsomix	sonney2k, nope
 gsomix	huh
 ted__	Dunno exactly yet what type of  similarity measure.
 ted__	Maybe for the beginning one you used with your already implemented string kernels which support features of diff size
 ted__	LocalAlignmentString ?
 ted__	Any advice ? :p
 blackburn	ted__: it is based on alignment - I am not sure it would work for your features
 blackburn	ted__: where these features come from?
 gsomix	pluskid, cool pictures :]
 ted__	spatial arrangement of my vectors are important: features extracted from video sequence, then I would like to keep the temporal info (=as in ACTCGCT)
 pluskid	gsomix: you like them? :D
 gsomix	pluskid, yep
 pluskid	gsomix: thanks! haha, I like drawing
 blackburn	ted__: really non-trivial thing you do
 ted__	I know but it seems to be a good way to keep temporal information which is lost in a bag-of-frame algo.
 ted__	maybe I could try with a mapping to [0,255] and see the results

 blackburn	pluskid: yes for kickoff meeting
 pluskid	when?
 ted__	I already checked those examples, was hoping you had somthg more specific on your own machines.
 blackburn	ted__: I am sorry, I haven't worked with such features (yet)
 ted__	blackburn: thanks anyway for all those info. Maybe anyone else have ?
 blackburn	ted__: yes sonney2k has some experience with strings but he is pretty busy

 pluskid	I don't think I will be available at 19 UTC
 pluskid	unless required
 pluskid	have to sleep :p

 pluskid	let me calculate
 pluskid	around UTC 00:30 maybe
 blackburn	there is a chance I will not be sleeping yet
 blackburn	a lot of things to do today

@sonney2k	blackburn, clarification in which respect?
 blackburn	sonney2k: explain to gsomix more what to do
@sonney2k	gsomix, I don't know what to explain actually ... is there anything in particular that is unclear?
 blackburn	ref/unref?
@sonney2k	I mean just continue to use SGVector& in arguments
@sonney2k	blackburn, but the SGVector& stuff is not yet complete or gsomix?
 blackburn	ah this transition should be pretty clear
 gsomix	huh, I had planned to discuss it tomorrow. :)
 gsomix	but ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok then
@sonney2k	gsomix, so please explain :)
 gsomix	sonney2k, hmm, I already did almost work for SGVector -> SGVector& in arguments, isn't it?
 gsomix	I am still wondering how to return SGVector from methods.
@sonney2k	gsomix, SGVector& except if you return a new sgvectro
@sonney2k	SGVector
@sonney2k	then just ^
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok?
 gsomix	sonney2k, it's clear for me. But I worry about how it is then transferred to ref/unref.
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.43.52] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, I'll do it in the next few days.
@sonney2k	gsomix, we do the ref/unref business after this is done
@sonney2k	gsomix, note that this will likely cause some errors that we cannot fix before we have ref/unref stuff
@sonney2k	gsomix, if you want to know about ref/unref stuff - let us just copy the functions we have in SGObject for now
 gsomix	sonney2k, well I think step-by-step strategy is correct.
@sonney2k	later on we should investigate whether we add another base class to derive SGVector / SGObject from
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw, the same task then for SGMatrix/SGStringList/SGSparseVector ...
@sonney2k	SGNDArray .. you name
@sonney2k	it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: a question, why to return SGVector and not a reference?
 n4nd0	I mean what you said to gsomix ^
@sonney2k	n4nd0, if he allocates a new vector within a function (as local variable) - he cannot return a reference to it
@sonney2k	since the reference will be invalid
@sonney2k	(object de-allocated when the function returns)
 n4nd0	wouldn't it better to create the vector to return in the heap?
 gsomix	blackburn, check a git.
 gsomix	*github
 n4nd0	some stuff ... = new SGVector<...more stuff
 blackburn	gsomix: nice
 gsomix	n4nd0, I think it's not good at now (without ref/unref).
 n4nd0	sonney2k: well actually SGVector is kind of light, a pointer and a couple of more things so probably the return by value shouldn't be much worse than returning a reference
 n4nd0	gsomix: do you prefer return by value as well?

 gsomix	n4nd0, it is a necessity, I mean
 n4nd0	gsomix: I wondered if return by reference was an option
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes the object is alloc'd on heap however just *once* since RVO is used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization
@sonney2k	n4nd0, there is no option
@sonney2k	n4nd0, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4643713/c-returning-reference-to-local-variable and the first answer
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, thank you

@sonney2k	n4nd0, send a pull request
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw didn't you also convert LDA to multiclass?
@sonney2k	blackburn, that reminds me - didn't we want to have CMulticlassLabels?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no, I didn't do anything to LDA
 n4nd0	sonney2k: once, even before QDA was done, it was commented though
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: we will do it once
@sonney2k	n4nd0, too bad - that's really something we should have if we have multiclass enabled QDA
 n4nd0	sonney2k: just for completeness or is there something else?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, multiclass LDA is certainly much more robust than QDA :)
@sonney2k	so it is really a very useful baseline method
@sonney2k	much faster than SVM on low-dim data sets and even optimal when you can assume gaussian distribs
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw have you seen that SLEP supports some logistic regression even?
@sonney2k	SLEP?
 blackburn	yes that package I am going to integrate
@sonney2k	but we have logistic regression in liblinear already?!
 blackburn	sonney2k: why not to provide alternative?
@sonney2k	I just don't understand your excitement
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is library containing a lot of L1 and L1/L2 things
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I quite don't understand why QDA may fail somewhere LDA successes
 n4nd0	I thought of QDA as a generalization, within class covariances need not to be equal, so I assumed it would give better results
 n4nd0	even if teh covariances are the same for all the classes, case where LDA would perform fine too

@sonney2k	n4nd0, estimating more parameters is difficult - so for noisy / not a lot of data LDA will work better

@sonney2k	n4nd0, can you be more specific?
@sonney2k	or attach a gdb bt
@sonney2k	I cannot make sense of that
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think the double free was caused by SG_UNREF I am doing and shouldn't be done
@sonney2k	which one?

 emrecelikten	PhilTillet: Next year mate :) I was rejected last year too, I know how it feels
 n4nd0	PhilTillet: sorry man
 PhilTillet	emrecelikten, I was rejected last year too :p
 wiking	n4nd0: when are you going to start the SO?
 emrecelikten	PhilTillet: I was being rejected for two years :P
 n4nd0	n4nd0: asap :)
 n4nd0	ups, again talking to me
 n4nd0	haha
 wiking	n4nd0: hahahah
 wiking	n4nd0: i'll need it
 wiking	asap :D
 n4nd0	wiking: cool, we can probably exchange some thoughts about it :)
 wiking	yeah sure
 wiking	are you going to use libqp?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: okay actually we are just not ready for gpuing..
 n4nd0	wiking: yes, that was the first option I thought of
 wiking	aha
 wiking	so then you are the third one
 PhilTillet	blackburn, why so?
 wiking	since i'm going to use it and michal as well
 blackburn	harshit_: I am very sorry - the problem is that Soeren is not capable to mentor two students
 wiking	so i've started to talk with sonney2k about how to refactor some stuff
 blackburn	PhilTillet: no real mentor for that
 blackburn	and no base for that actually
 wiking	n4nd0: i'll push this week something so your comments are more than welcome
 PhilTillet	hmmm ok
 n4nd0	wiking: thank you
 harshit_	blackburn, can understand :|
 blackburn	I really hope you are not upset with anything
 n4nd0	wiking: I'll start to be much more active again after Saturday
 n4nd0	damned exams
 PhilTillet	blackburn, I'm not ^^
 wiking	n4nd0: no worries
 blackburn	PhilTillet: that's nice :)
 blackburn	PhilTillet: we are still welcome your contributions
 blackburn	harshit_: your contributions are welcome too I hope you are not very frustrated!
 PhilTillet	blackburn, I'll probably do the project on my own :) that's why I sent only one application, there's no point in working in something i'm not fully interested in ;
 PhilTillet	:)
 gsomix	hey, congrats guys
 harshit_	blackburn, no, actually a lil. but still can work on NN for shogun , and my research
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, harshit_ let me explain a bit
 blackburn	you all have done really a lot of work
 harshit_	blackburn, but summer could be better with gsoc
@sonney2k	I am/was the only mentor for your projects and the one we selected gsomix for
@sonney2k	I would have loved to take you both too but I simply cannot handle >1 student
@sonney2k	so we decided for the task we needed most - and that is some restructuring / accessibility cleanups
@sonney2k	there was nothing wrong with your proposal or involvement or anything
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, we know :)
@sonney2k	it really is about being at our capacity limits
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, nothing prevents us from contributing without being paid I guess :)
 harshit_	sonney2k, no worries :)
@sonney2k	and there is nothing I could do about it so late
@sonney2k	in the end I *never* expected that we get 9 slots
@sonney2k	if I knew that beforehand I would have asked a lot more people :)
 PhilTillet	:p
@sonney2k	anyways whole wikimedia foundation has 8 (or 9?) slots
 puffin444	Wow
@sonney2k	so just to give you some impression how many we received
 blackburn	we keep receiving strong gsoc support :)
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, harshit_ of course we welcome your contributions
 harshit_	sonney2k, sure ..!
@sonney2k	karlnapf, do you have a homepage I can link to
@sonney2k	puffin444, ^ ?
@sonney2k	and does any of the students here blog? I can put you on shogun planet if you want...
 puffin444	sonney2k: Not at the current moment. I might be able to make one if you need one though.
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think introduction @ mailing list is a good idea?
@sonney2k	not required - I just wanted to give it some traffic - hehe
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think so
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I want to take advantage of gsoc and start doing it
 blackburn	hey guys
@sonney2k	blackburn, I totally forgot how we did it last year
 blackburn	sonney2k: just some introduction mail nothing special I think
@sonney2k	blackburn: every student had to send some short email introducing himself + project right?
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	n4nd0: puffin444: wiking: karlnapf: gsomix: could you please do this ^?
 blackburn	karlnapf: however you are well-known
@sonney2k	but still
 blackburn	yes there is a need to introduce your project
@sonney2k	you can look up in the mailinglist archive how these things look like
 n4nd0	all right
 blackburn	jsut some short introduction
 puffin444	blackburn: Yeah sure.
@sonney2k	the other more annoying job is to send a weekly update (from the official beginning to end of gsoc)
 blackburn	and some feature plan would be nice
@sonney2k	so another short email
@sonney2k	*short*
@sonney2k	cannot be said often enough
 blackburn	attach pics!
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	blackburn: on shogun mailing list?
 blackburn	wiking: right
@sonney2k	yeah
 wiking	alrighty i'll do it tomo morning
@sonney2k	wiking, thanks
 wiking	nw
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes I just created a hp, but its not completely ready, will send you the link this week
 karlnapf	blackburn, I will send an introducionary mail :)
@sonney2k	karlnapf, your old blog is dead too it seems
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you understand things will go even more crazy next days?
 blackburn	I'll send too
@sonney2k	blackburn, why should they?
 blackburn	sonney2k: once active development begins it would become crazy I am sure :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yes i took it offline to replace it by something nicer
* wiking wonders about the average number of users on #shogun after a month ;)
 n4nd0	:D
@sonney2k	wiking, let me guess 8 :D
 wiking	sonney2k: + the bots!
 blackburn	n4nd0: your task is really important and you will definitely collaborate with wiking and michal!
 n4nd0	blackburn: sounds very exciting
 wiking	yeah i'll most def will need a SO asap :>>
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that is why you were chosen ... we have high trust in you
 wiking	n4nd0: SO WORK!!!
 n4nd0	wiking: :D
