 sonne_	wiking: we had modules with swig
-!- sonne_ is now known as sonne|osx
 sonne|osx	wiking: but this caused all kinds of trouble (crashers/stuff not working) due to dependencies between modules
 sonne|osx	wiking: that is why I dropped that maybe about 1-2 years ago

 sonne|osx	ohh and compile time was actually not that much shorter... modules are bigger due to quite some overlap (e.g. shogun.Kernels needed shogun.Features)
 sonne|osx	and yes that is why we have these shogun.Features etc - we started modular

@wiking	sonne|work: \o/
 sonne|work	wiking: do you have an idea how I can match the name of a variable?
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean say I iterate over all variables
 sonne|work	but want to print out stuff only for variables with name starting with USE_
 sonne|work	I guess I have it
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: get_cmake_property(vs VARIABLES)
@lisitsyn	then
@lisitsyn	foreach(v ${vs})
@lisitsyn	... check if USE_ and some actions
@lisitsyn	endforeach(v)
@lisitsyn	I am searching how to check it
@lisitsyn	sonne|work:
@lisitsyn	if ($v MATCHES "your regexp")
@lisitsyn	... your actions
@lisitsyn	endif()

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yea found it already...
@iglesiasg	good morning
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: where are you going to stay in the us?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: errm in the hotel :D
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: but you are arriving a week before?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: no
@lisitsyn	when will you arrive?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I wanted to arrive on friday just in time for dinner
@lisitsyn	friday 18th?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: so something changed I guess? I was sure you said you planned to arrive earlier
 sonne|work	no nothing changed
 sonne|work	I said that all the time...
@lisitsyn	ah may be you stay more?
@lisitsyn	when you go back then?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: it can't be I play with my imagination :D
 sonne|work	My plan is/was to be there on the 18th and then stay one week
@lisitsyn	ooh alright
@lisitsyn	where do you stay next week then?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well I think you are pretty overloaded these days...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I just wanted to clarify what do you and Heiko plan :)
 sonne|work	No idea
 sonne|work	I think on the day it became clear I sent an email to you 2 with my plans but never got a reply
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: will you stay longer than the summit?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: or will you just arrive on the 18th and go back on the 20th?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I haven't decided but it wouldn't make sense if I would be 'alone' :)
 sonne|work	alone as in w/o gf?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: w/o you and Heiko too
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	I mean I don't know anybody there
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, perfect time to make friends in the US!
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: haha how? just walk around and ask people?
@lisitsyn	;)
 sonne|work	I guess we could meet Olivier and Quoc
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: you have to talk to all the people at the summit
 sonne|work	and done
@lisitsyn	yes sure but still
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, the mentors gsocers
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I don't mind to stay a few days more
 sonne|work	they are all in the same boat
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: so we can travel around and hack shogun or whatever
@lisitsyn	that's why I ask ;)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well anything is possible... I will certainly rent a car
 sonne|work	so we could go hiking in the redwoods or some other national park
 sonne|work	etc
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I found the mail so I am recalling you to get a new passport
 sonne|work	yeah already done (will get one within a month latest)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: and don't forget to apply for esta http://www.esta.us/
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I didn't know about it
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: no it is not for me
* wiking is doing hadoop integration of shogun
 sonne|work	I guess you need a passport for doing so
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: it is only for you and heiko (visa waiver programme)
@lisitsyn	I will have a passport with an us visa
@lisitsyn	(if they not reject me)
@iglesiasg	wiking, it sounds cool! What do you want to use it for?
@wiking	iglesiasg: now? nothing... i just want to have it so that it can be serialised to and from hdfs + do some jobs over hadoop
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: anyway thanks for letting me know
@lisitsyn	I will have B2 visa
@lisitsyn	(I hope)
@lisitsyn	ah no B1
@wiking	iglesiasg: which reminds me to do automated test with serialization + the ones heiko asked for
 sonne|work	wiking: and upload the videos and do static interfaces w/ cmake :D
 sonne|work	wiking: did you know that you lead the stats this month?
@wiking	sonne|work: hehe good on me \o/
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah about the statics
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: wiking lead everything this month
@wiking	sonne|work: you might know things the best
@wiking	sonne|work: because i really hate digging in the shogun's old makefile.template
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: btw did you notice that you removed 3 times as much code as you added?
 sonne|work	err 10 times
@wiking	sonne|work: python_static = libshogun objs + the python_static objs in a shared lib?
 sonne|work	wiking: exactly
@wiking	sonne|work: r_static the same?
@wiking	sonne|work: matlab_static?
 sonne|work	wiking: all the same
@wiking	and while we are at it, i dont understand this at all:
@wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1581/steps/compile%20csharp_modular/logs/stdio
@wiking	sonne|work: ^
 sonne|work	wiking: only elwms will need to link against all
 sonne|work	wiking: that is an issue with cshapr and typemaps
@wiking	sonne|work: but why only on slave3?
 sonne|work	wiking: when you do a function foo(SGVector,SGVector) csharp will vomit
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yeah I have seen
@lisitsyn	no idea why
@wiking	sonne|work: slave4 works ok
 sonne|work	wiking: no way
@lisitsyn	may be I AM THE DESTRUCTOR
@wiking	sonne|work: yes way: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1579/steps/test%20csharp_modular/logs/stdio
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: your contry is produced the best destructors the world has
 sonne|work	wiking: no way really
 sonne|work	wiking: must be different branch or sth
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yeah years ago
@wiking	sonne|work: dunno why but slave4 compiles ok and slave3 does not
 sonne|work	wiking: or some define not active or include missing - cannot be
@wiking	oh osx bot is down :(
@wiking	sonne|work: do we still want cmd_static? :D
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
@wiking	...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: have you seen NIPS is hosting MLOSS workshop?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: is there an official workshop list / announcement somewhere?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes on 'your' website ;)
@lisitsyn	http://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: it is good that they continue this but I guess they ran out of manpower
 sonne|work	so if someone wants to submit shogun and go to nips...
@wiking	yeah submit!
@wiking	who pays? :)
 sonne|work	you yourself or someone who funds you :/
@lisitsyn	I would like but I would be fired
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	/Users/wiking/shogun/src/interfaces/cmdline_static/CmdLineInterface.h:7:10: fatal error: 'ui/SGInterface.h' file not found
-!- dkyang [7ae07e1e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.122.224.126.30] has joined #shogun
@wiking	is there a good reason why SGInterface is being includede like this and not the standard <shogun/ui/SGInterface.h> ?
@lisitsyn	ha
@lisitsyn	wiking: is ithe same in other interfaces?
@wiking	dunno i'm just testing cmdline
 sonne|work	wiking: error
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes indeed r_static has the same
@lisitsyn	ha
 sonne|work	not intentional
@lisitsyn	well I'd change it
@lisitsyn	as sonne|work said it is not intentional please change it then ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: seen my reply about modshogun?
@wiking	sonne|work: ah the swig modular?
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah
@wiking	yeah i saw that one
 sonne|work	wiking: so you understood?
@wiking	yeps
@wiking	sonne|work: btw: cmdline interface: is that like the .o-s in that directory and linked to libshogun shared?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes
@wiking	ok i 'think' it's ready
@wiking	sonne|work: what was the name of the python static lib?
 sonne|work	wiking: sg.so
 sonne|work	wiking: same for the others
 sonne|work	wiking: except for elwms.so
 dkyang	Hi,I'd like to get involved in shogun.Is there any module need to be worked on?
@wiking	dkyang: :) a lot :>
 sonne|work	dkyang: any preferences?
 dkyang	I don't know how to say it, sorry for my poor english. :) Maybe something like feature learning?
 dkyang	sparse coding?
@wiking	dkyang: yeah mlpack has that one it's good to start from what they have ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: status of r_modular?
 sonne|work	dkyang: yeah we don't have anything like that so your contributions would be welcome
 sonne|work	wiking: well it compiles and I was able to run some very basic stuff
 dkyang	Thanks for helping,I'm glad if I can do something beneficial.
@wiking	sonne|work: what's with ref counting
@wiking	?
@wiking	sonne|work: you've tested i guess w/o refcounting or something?
@wiking	sonne|work: afaik cmake has been not really tested with r_modular :)
 sonne|work	wiking: well I didn't test with cmake no
@wiking	sonne|work: oke... refcounting is turned of in case of r_modular?
 sonne|work	wiking: only with configure but I guess you did the same with R?
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't remember if that was necessary
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i've treid
@wiking	*tried
 sonne|work	what did happen?
@wiking	i mean i've tried to mimic what ./configure did
@wiking	ok let's see now the buildbot...

 sonne|work	wiking: did you add taht to the static buildbot setting?
@wiking	sonne|work: i'm just on it atm
 sonne|work	kk
@wiking	sonne|work: packages?
@wiking	:)
@wiking	sonne|work: ipython notebooks? :)
@wiking	sonne|work: new server ? :)
@wiking	sonne|work: r u editin now master.cfg on 7nn?
 sonne|work	wiking: just edit it
 sonne|work	wiking: I think I left a screen session open
 sonne|work	wiking: we need a meeting to decide that we rent a new server
 sonne|work	I cannot just spend money at will :)
 sonne|work	wiking: and ipython well - things are there but we need to present them somewhere/somehow
@wiking	sonne|work packages?
 sonne|work	what?
@wiking	iglesiasg: lisitsyn r u against renting a server for shogun purposes from the gsoc money? :D
@wiking	sonne|work: well now we have osx native package + debian tar.gz
@iglesiasg	wiking, of course not
@wiking	sonne|work: we should start uploading them somewhere
@lisitsyn	wiking: I don't mind even if sonne|work buys a giant pony
 sonne|work	wiking: we should create those nightly only when all tests pass
@wiking	sonne|work: there u go it's decided... rent the server :) or of course it'd be better if the fundation would actually directly rent that server :S
 sonne|work	lisitsyn, wiking, iglesiasg - it will be 50EUR / month for this machine http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex40
@wiking	sonne|work: i'm totally cool with it.... i have hetzner server myself for the last 2 years and i'm totally satisfied with their service
@lisitsyn	as I said - okay :)
 sonne|work	well yeah I write something like our shogun toolbox foundation as name on the bill
@wiking	sonne|work: can we do that?
@wiking	i mean before actually the fundation is settled?
@iglesiasg	wow that is an awesome machine
@wiking	iglesiasg: the backend is really cool as well... fast and stable
 sonne|work	wiking: errm setup costs 99 $??
@wiking	sonne|work: 50eur
@wiking	no?
@wiking	there's setup cost for sure
@wiking	i know that
 sonne|work	100 EUR yes
@wiking	oh woah! fuck
@wiking	bastards
@wiking	they raised the setup cost
 sonne|work	http://www.ovh.de/dedicated_server/isgenug.xml
 sonne|work	or we take that one
 sonne|work	only 24GB but 36 EUR/month
@wiking	36?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	sonne|work: have u read somewhere any reviews about them
@wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: well shogun-toolbox.org is running there
 sonne|work	for ~1 year and so are my personal servers
@wiking	ah cool
@wiking	then you know them

 sonne|work	btw I did my tax decl. - so we will see soon how much shogun money we have
@lisitsyn	any estimate? :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: in the worst case 50% of the money is gone
@wiking	:(
 sonne|work	wasted to build the best airport ever BER!
@lisitsyn	hahaha
@wiking	:DDDD
@wiking	so 36 gigs vs 24 gigs of ram
@wiking	50 vs 36
@lisitsyn	schoenefeld is ok why to build another one ;)
@iglesiasg	are they doing a third one in Berlin?
@wiking	that's like 168 euros/year :(
 sonne|work	we actually had 3
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: close these two and open one big
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aham
 sonne|work	wiking: 362 / year
@wiking	sonne|work:  i mean the diff

 thoralf	sonne|work, wiking: What are the minimal requirements for the build bot?
@wiking	well we could use that extra 12 gigs of ram :)
@wiking	thoralf: depends
@wiking	thoralf: if u dont need modular interface
@wiking	then it's like 1.5 gigs ram :P
@lisitsyn	guys we've got to reduce our memory/CPU requirements
@lisitsyn	I am scaried we need 432432 GB to build it
@lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheh yeah i couldn't compile shogun on DO
@wiking	even with a 2gigs vsp
@wiking	*vps
@wiking	lisitsyn: and i didn't even tried to compile modular
@wiking	only the simple libshogun

@wiking	sonne|work: i think we'd need this for the packages: http://docs.buildbot.net/0.8.0/full.html#Dependent-Scheduler
 sonne|work	wiking: I would rather not do it extra - since then we need to compile again
 sonne|work	wiking: but yes we have this to only compile libshogun first - when that works compile the other interfaces

@wiking	sonne|work: mmmm but let's say in case of osx package. if it compiles right and the test are 100% then it should just create the package regardless what's the status of cygwin or linux bots, or?

@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@HeikoS	wiking: hi!
@HeikoS	dude
@HeikoS	never ever upgrade ubuntu
@HeikoS	evil
@wiking	:D
@wiking	hahahah
@wiking	that was alwaaaays like that
@wiking	since forever
@HeikoS	wiking: man its 2013
@HeikoS	mankind is flying to the moon and stuff
@HeikoS	I can expect that my computer still works after an upgrade
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	anyway, how is it going?
@HeikoS	ah sweet, virtual desktops got deactivated
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Viktor Gal :develop * 521cc4b / src/interfaces/cmdline_static/CMakeLists.txt: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/521cc4b40844034629fe136fc9e9dd32b9869cd0
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Rename cmdline_static target
@wiking	HeikoS: well i'm just thinking about finishing up the automated tests
@wiking	but quite frankly
@wiking	in case of clone, equals, clone+equals and get_name
@wiking	the python script would be exactly the same
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@HeikoS	but if they are executed one after another
@HeikoS	that helps tracking down the problem
@HeikoS	many people asked me why their clone test fails
@HeikoS	and it was always something get_name
@HeikoS	or non-initialised memory
@HeikoS	so just creating empty instance is useful
@wiking	yeah yeah
@HeikoS	get name also
@wiking	no i was just thinking about the script itself
@HeikoS	ah I see
@wiking	that i shoudl make it in a way
@wiking	that they share some parts
@HeikoS	wiking: well maybe just accept the duplicate code
@wiking	and not copy-paste
@HeikoS	dont know whether thats worth it
@wiking	HeikoS: well it's just putting the stuff into a common .py
@wiking	and then import that into all the scripts
@HeikoS	wiking: if its not too much hassle, then maybe
@wiking	yeah i'll do that now
@HeikoS	but also makes it harder to undetrstand for new devs
 thoralf	wiking: Is there a make target which only builds the unit-tests but does not execute them?
@wiking	thoralf: make shogun-unit-test
@wiking	that creates the exec
 thoralf	wiking: Cool, thanks.
@wiking	HeikoS: well it's python script :P
@wiking	HeikoS: i u dont understand what's import you'll suck at it anyways
@HeikoS	wiking: do you have any idea why a webbrowser opens everytime I clock on the sidebar
@wiking	eh? :D
@HeikoS	wiking: well then go ahead :)
@wiking	HeikoS: i'm more concerned if i could set the order
@wiking	of the tests
@HeikoS	wiking: yes thats important
@wiking	as u said it'd be great to have: get_name, clone, clone+equals
@wiking	but i dont know if i can do that with gtest
@wiking	HeikoS: "By default, Google Test uses a random seed calculated from the current time. Therefore you'll get a different order every time."
@wiking	HeikoS: so basically if we want to have the order
@wiking	we do the whole test within one block
@wiking	:S
@wiking	i mean you'll get the line number anyways where did it fail
@HeikoS	wiking: mmmmh
@HeikoS	what about allowing them to fail?
@HeikoS	then if say get_name is wrong
@HeikoS	all of them fail
@HeikoS	providing quite some information
@HeikoS	if there is a bug in clone, only that last one will fail
@HeikoS	so the order is in fact not important
@wiking	?
@wiking	allow them to fail?
@wiking	i mean in gtest if a test fail (except segfault) it'll run all the tests
@wiking	*fails
@wiking	but of course you'll have 3 fails because of get_name()
@wiking	HeikoS: why dont we do this in one codeblock?
@HeikoS	wiking: I dont like one codeblock
@wiking	i mean if a getname fails
@HeikoS	hiding infos
@wiking	then it won't try to run clone and equals
@HeikoS	or what do you mean?
@HeikoS	wiking: is that clearly visible then?
@HeikoS	if yes, then its fine
@wiking	HeikoS: yes yes
@HeikoS	wiking: another problem is testing for memory
@HeikoS	is it possible to seperately test all of them?
@wiking	HeikoS: it'll tell you exactly which test (which line) failed exactly
@HeikoS	if we later on make valgrind mandatory?
@wiking	HeikoS: define separate :)

@HeikoS	ok then
@wiking	HeikoS: u can run WhateverClass.whicevertest separately
@wiking	if u want
@wiking	you can run WhateverClass.*
@HeikoS	wiking: ok then we can use this for memory testing later
@wiking	HeikoS: well if we put of course
 sonne|work	HeikoS: well use debian if you want something stable :P
@wiking	getname + clone + clone equals
@wiking	in one test
@wiking	then of course you wont be able to separete that
@wiking	HeikoS: the bigger problem is actually
@wiking	that we have memchecking support with cmake
@wiking	but
 sonne|work	wiking: wrt osx and packages - we should IMHO build for all interfaces and then create a big package from that
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I know ;) I tried, but software too old, I just needed a more recent scipy which support some more sparse stuff
@wiking	that would run valgrind on the whole unit-test....
@wiking	sonne|work: yeps... but only nightly... or?
@wiking	sonne|work: or you want to always build on that poor osx buildbot all the interfaces :D
@wiking	HeikoS: ok i'm modifying now the clone_eqauls test
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@wiking	and then i'll add serialisation test for all the backends
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: and then I have to fix stuff I guess ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you think about the non-trivial cases?
 sonne|work	wiking: no I mean we should do all the doc/package/etc stuff in our nightly default - and nightly default should have all the supported interfaces enabled / to be build. so all static/modular
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i get that one
@wiking	sonne|work: but we need to define nightly_default for osx buildbot as well
@wiking	sonne|work: if we want to supply osx packages
@wiking	HeikoS: huh
 sonne|work	wiking: I am using that poor osx macbook air as my travel machine for shogun now so around daytime it won't build btw but only evening
@wiking	sonne|work: ehehehhe :)))
 sonne|work	wiking: so what do we do about the server - take the 24G one?
@HeikoS	wiking: classes with content rather than everything NULL
@wiking	sonne|work: i've checked licensing about osx
@wiking	sonne|work: we can have osx buildbot in a VM
 sonne|work	wiking: well 450EUR for a dedicated osx buildbot is a bit too much no?
@wiking	sonne|work: i own 2 licenses of OSX that allows me to run 4 osxes
 sonne|work	HeikoS: are you ok with us ordering another server for buildbot etc where we all will have logins?
@wiking	sonne|work: even in a VM
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh ok nice
@wiking	sonne|work: but but!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yes I am
 sonne|work	wiking: but but?
@wiking	sonne|work: think about the ram that OSX VM will eat
 sonne|work	osx server?
@wiking	no
@wiking	we cannot have that :(
@wiking	the license does not allow osx server
@wiking	:(
@wiking	only osx desktop
 sonne|work	wiking: I think you need quite some hacks to run osx inside a VM that is not on a mac
@wiking	sonne|work: virtualbox
 sonne|work	wiking: IIRC you are allowed to do that only on a mac
@wiking	sonne|work: apt-get install and thats allo
@wiking	*all
@wiking	nono
@HeikoS	wiking: with the new ubuntu, I gett locally
@HeikoS	make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/lib/libnlopt.so', needed by `src/shogun/libshogun.so.14.0'.  Stop.
@wiking	i've read about this in the VB forums
@wiking	and tickets
 sonne|work	wiking: well we give osx 8 GB - should be sufficient right? and btw we could also only run things at a time
@HeikoS	the file is here
@HeikoS	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnlopt.so
 sonne|work	HeikoS: well rm -rf build
@HeikoS	whose fault is that?
@wiking	HeikoS: fire a bug :)
@HeikoS	ah
 sonne|work	HeikoS: and redo cmake
@HeikoS	make clean doesnt do it?
@wiking	HeikoS: but yeah first try to clean the cmake
@HeikoS	I did ccmake clean ..
@wiking	HeikoS: rm -rf build is safe ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: mmm yeah 8 gigs should be fine
 sonne|work	wiking: I think the 24G are sufficient or we have to order another one :D
@wiking	even 4
@wiking	or lets say 6
@wiking	and then we for sure can build the modular interfaces as well
@wiking	sonne|work: heheheh :D
@wiking	sonne|work: so let's say base system + osx bot
@wiking	what else
@wiking	just to see if we fit in nicely
@HeikoS	ah that did it thanks
 sonne|work	wiking: well the interactive demos
 sonne|work	wiking: they might eat a few GB
 sonne|work	lets say 4
@wiking	ok that's like 10 with the osx bot
@wiking	so we have like 12 more
@wiking	the base system will eat at least 2gigs i would say
 sonne|work	24 -4 -6 == 14 ?
 sonne|work	wiking: nope maybe 200MB
@wiking	sonne|work: u recon
@wiking	reckon
 sonne|work	then buildbot ~200MB
@wiking	ok
@wiking	+ nginx
@wiking	i guess
 sonne|work	ngings 100MB
 sonne|work	x
@wiking	do we need an sql?
 sonne|work	maybe not
 sonne|work	no idea
 sonne|work	but say another 500mb
@wiking	sonne|work: would we move the webpage there ?
 sonne|work	still plenty room
@wiking	ok
 sonne|work	wiking: well if possible I would keep the current webserver alive
@wiking	we can have at least one more VM or?
@wiking	i mean for testing purposes
 sonne|work	wiking: and let it do the nightly builds but not much more
@wiking	lets say somebody comes in with a funky error
@wiking	with a funky os
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah but why a VM?
 sonne|work	I mean it is rather a scratch setup
@wiking	we could just run a new VM instance fast and try out the stuff
 sonne|work	or just try directly in a chroot
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah if it's linux
@wiking	sonne|work: btw how much is a win license nowadays?
@wiking	lisitsyn: iglesiasg HeikoS ^
@HeikoS	?
@wiking	sonne|work: because we should start thinking about windows builds
@iglesiasg	wiking, no idea
@HeikoS	yes +1
@wiking	sonne|work: with cmake we can do it...
 sonne|work	wiking: well we have a windows machine already
@HeikoS	I dont know havent used windows for quite some time
@wiking	sonne|work: could we run there a pure MSVC based buildbot as well?
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I just used it for my tax decl.
 sonne|work	wiking: sure
 sonne|work	it has sufficient mem and disk
 sonne|work	just single core in the vm but that is not the problem
@wiking	sonne|work: ok then when u have time plz just install buildbot + MSVS + cmake on that machine
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't have MSVS
@wiking	sonne|work: express is for free
 sonne|work	and I didn't get a reply from the guy at the institute
 sonne|work	express can build shogun?
@wiking	sonne|work: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i'm working on it... but we'll get there
@wiking	sonne|work: with cmake i have already the solution file for VS
@wiking	sonne|work: needs some hacking but will get there...
@wiking	sonne|work: so i'm just saying that one way or another we should have a pure windows based buildbot
@wiking	either on this new machine or somewhere...
 sonne|work	wiking: which version?
@wiking	sonne|work: windows or VS? :)
@wiking	vs doesn't matter
@wiking	would be great if it's 2010 or later
 sonne|work	well windows we have 7 and sry no 8 for me
@wiking	ok so win7 + vs 2010 or later
 sonne|work	and we need to sign up w/ M$
@wiking	cmake will generate the right solution file...
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so about the trip - I am planning to go on the 18th and then stay the week after (to be back on the weekend)
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so rent a car etc
@wiking	i mean if this guy who owns the cygwin buildbot can setup a VS env for us
@wiking	we are set
 sonne|work	HeikoS: we could meet Olivier/Quoc or so ...
@wiking	if not then we should really think about getting a windows license :S
 sonne|work	wiking: well I administer this thing so sure we can do
@wiking	sonne|work: kayak.com last time i was there i've got a ford mustang cabrio for 15USD/day
 sonne|work	wiking: and it has a windows license
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so go back on 25?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: ok I am fine with that!
 sonne|work	yeah around that
@HeikoS	sonne|work: should be book flights together?
@wiking	sonne|work: ok cool so then just install the stuff on that machine. native python+cmake+vs express+buildbot
@HeikoS	when should we book?
@HeikoS	soon or wait for google money?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: where do you want to stay? We could rent a small flat on airbnb or so
@wiking	sonne|work: see again c# compiled fine on slave4: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1583
@wiking	:S
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I was planning to be at the summit from 18-20 and then still sleep in the hotel for 1 night
@HeikoS	sonne|work: and afterwards?
 sonne|work	then e.g. meet people at google or so and then go to santa cruz
@HeikoS	I mean sleeping
 sonne|work	maybe some national park (and hike there)
@HeikoS	yeah totally
@HeikoS	so stay somewhere else every night?
@wiking	sonne|work: go here, it's really great place to hang around: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17-Mile_Drive
@HeikoS	I think I am pretty much open to everything :)
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so if we dont need that windows buildbot extra then we should just get that machine for 36 euros/month
@wiking	HeikoS: https://gist.github.com/vigsterkr/6318518
@wiking	HeikoS: would u b ok with this?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes! but do get name first
@wiking	HeikoS: isn't it the first? :)
@wiking	https://gist.github.com/vigsterkr/6318518#file-clone_unittest-cc-jinja2-L8
@HeikoS	ah sorry yes
@wiking	the first assert is really just about getting the object ;P
@wiking	ok i'll do this for the temp classes
@wiking	and here we go
@HeikoS	object2 has to be unrefeed
 shogun-buildbot	build #1500 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1500  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>

@wiking	ok i'll test it first locally :D

@wiking	eh why not buildbot?!
@wiking	HeikoS: ok so what about obtain from generic?
@wiking	HeikoS: while we are at hacking jinja2 templates :D
@HeikoS	wiking: since devs can easily use dynamic cast with an assert (they KNOW they expected type), we dont need this inside shogun code, so no ifdefs in there
@HeikoS	so I would say lets do it optional
@HeikoS	to not have the dependency
@HeikoS	its mainly for modular interface users who cannot cast otherwise
 shogun-buildbot	build #1501 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1501  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Thoralf Klein <thoralf.klein@zib.de>, Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@HeikoS	my optinion
@wiking	HeikoS: okey
@HeikoS	ask lisitsyn and sonne|work though
@wiking	so then 1) serialization unit tests + 2) obtain from generic :)
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	good hacking :)
@wiking	HeikoS: well it could be usefull in case of serialization fw
@HeikoS	wiking: it will be
@lisitsyn	yes? what?
@HeikoS	wiking: the only thing is the non-trivial data
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah in kow
@wiking	*i know
@HeikoS	that is yet unsolved and this will massively increase the usefulness of these tests
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: obtain_from_generic optional
@wiking	indeed
@HeikoS	wiking: let me know your ideas on this :)
@wiking	HeikoS: ppppfff
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, wiking, HeikoS, sonney2k do you guys know about this CombinedKernel weights issue asked in the mailing list?
@wiking	HeikoS: braindead about this
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: why/
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes, but no idea, he is right ;)
@iglesiasg	in MKL the kernel weights should add up to 1, I think
@iglesiasg	is combined kernel implementing that?
@HeikoS	wiking: two alternating approaches
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: why to make it optional?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no MKL*
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: combined kernel can have anything
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I bet its a bug
@wiking	iglesiasg: afaik anything
@HeikoS	but no idea about this stuff
@iglesiasg	mm
@iglesiasg	so then they do not have to add up to 1 in combined kernel?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: because otherwise libshogun depends on jinja2
@wiking	iglesiasg: mmm i dont know in case of MKL
@wiking	iglesiasg: but other than that the weights can be anything
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: no, but usually the weights are convex
@HeikoS	but I dont know, sonne|work wrote this
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ahh
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, all right. Let's ask sonne|work once he is back then :)
@HeikoS	wiking, iglesiasg the weights have to be bounded otherwise one cannot optimise
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yep I think thats best
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, that makes sense
@wiking	:D
@iglesiasg	but I think it can fine if they don't add up to one
@iglesiasg	but I am not sure
 thoralf	iglesiasg, HeikoS: I think it depends what you're learning.  You can also constrain |w|_p = 1
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: it depends on what is done with them after learning
 thoralf	for instance 2-norm
 thoralf	or better |w|_p^p = 1
 thoralf	don't know the exact definition
@iglesiasg	thoralf, aham that makes sense too. It might be that it is another norm than L1 the one that is set to one
@wiking	HeikoS: another thing... computationengine
@wiking	HeikoS: i get that that you want to use mpi
@wiking	HeikoS: but i seriously think that sending data over sockets is really not the most optimal stuff... we should somehow support to pass around references to data on the fs to use
@wiking	because now basically what you'll do with an IndependentJob is that you add everything into it
@wiking	and then serialise/deserialise it
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Yes.  If individual weights are within [0;1], then it doesn't look that bad. ;)
@wiking	and run compute in it
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	wiking: in this moment I am writing something like this in python
@HeikoS	for PBS
@wiking	but i dont think it's really good idea to pass around vectors/features/matrixes
@HeikoS	where one can only communicate over FS
@HeikoS	wiking: Ill share the code once its done
@HeikoS	almost the same framework as in shogun
@HeikoS	and I will use/test it soon
@HeikoS	if it works nice, we can think of adding it to shogun
@HeikoS	I basically store the jobs on the FS
@HeikoS	and shared data is loaded by the job
@HeikoS	and the engine then checks whether certain result files exist
@wiking	HeikoS: i'm just now trying to write the hadoop backend with shogun
@HeikoS	and submits jobs to the PBS queue
@HeikoS	wiking: wow !
@wiking	HeikoS: and there it's really you pass the job ... but not the data itself
@wiking	HeikoS: as the data is sitting on the hdfs
@wiking	which is obviously accessible by all the nodes
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@HeikoS	well the job is a fiule
@HeikoS	file
-!- gsomix__ [~gsomix@95.67.189.148] has joined #shogun
@wiking	yeah i know... but then always we serialise the data
@wiking	so let's say we have we have the data sitting on the fs already
@wiking	a CFeatures serialised
@wiking	one should be able to just say ok here's the job and that's the data there
@wiking	do your job
@HeikoS	wiking: I thinks this is task of the job type
@HeikoS	yes the job just is executed
@HeikoS	it can do this then
@wiking	w8
@wiking	i'll get back to u in a sec

@wiking	ok these are fixed
@wiking	HeikoS: you'll have some fun now with fixing .equals
@wiking	:(
@wiking	should i commit the test, or we dont want constantly failing travis?
@HeikoS	wiking: on empty instances?
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: commit it and blacklist
@HeikoS	easiest for me
@wiking	HeikoS: i cannot blacklist it as it's templated :P
@HeikoS	wiking: thats most likely uninitialised memory, Ill have a look
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	so how can I access?
@wiking	HeikoS: i mean i can but it's really fucking awkward to do
@wiking	HeikoS: ok i'll push the fix for the get_names
@HeikoS	wiking: can you give me a list of classnames that fail?
@HeikoS	then Ill write a program locally
@wiking	and then i'll just give u the patch
@wiking	and u can run locally the unit test

@wiking	HeikoS: hahah you'll be shocked about this :)
@wiking	HeikoS: http://pastebin.com/iR1Wmn1y
@wiking	i don't understand that how's that possible that SGObject.clone_equals errors are not a true subset of SerializationAscii
@wiking	since SerializationAscii uses object->equals()
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	the same classes fail?
@wiking	no
@wiking	that's the funky part
@wiking	as u can see the two sets does have an intersection
@wiking	but for example MCLDA doesn't fail with serialization+equals
@wiking	:DDD
@wiking	HeikoS: even more... 2 consequtive tests does not give the same errors with serialization :P
@HeikoS	weiiiird :)
@wiking	yeps
@wiking	anyhow i'll write these tests
@wiking	maybe i'll add it to a separate branch

 sonne|work	you want to store your model as .json / ascii sometimes as hdf5 etc
@wiking	well if we know that it's lossy, hence it cannot really truly serialise a class then we should just not have it

 pickle27	wiking: how can I force swig to re-update when building
@wiking	what do u mean by reupdate?
 pickle27	wiking: Im doing work on the swig_typemaps.i file
 pickle27	wiking: but when I make changes it doesn't affect the build unless I make clean
@wiking	fuck
@wiking	it should
@wiking	ok checking
@wiking	ooooohmaaaan
@wiking	clang just fucking died :)
@iglesiasg	RIP
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	never seen a compiler fail so badly
 pickle27	wiking: looks like deleting the folder under build/src/interfaces/octave_modular worked
* wiking wonders why...
@wiking	pickle27: yeah that shuld definitely
@wiking	but still
 pickle27	it re ran a bit of configure but didn't rebuild anything
@wiking	715K Aug 23 16:53 SerializationJSON_unittest.cc mmmm
@wiking	maybe it's a bit too big? :<
@wiking	let's see what gcc does with it :)
@wiking	pickle27: i mean the thing is that
@wiking	there's this in the cmake file
@wiking	COMMAND "${CMAKE_COMMAND}" -E copy_if_different ${file} ${fname}
@wiking	that should make sure that if you change something in interfaces/modular/*i
@wiking	then it would copy the new one
 pickle27	wiking: weird
@wiking	pickle27: can u check if at least it's copied over?
 pickle27	wiking: I haven't upstream merged in 2 days is that line new?
 pickle27	sure I'll check next time I make a change
@wiking	i mean from ./src/interfaces/modular/ to ./build/src/interfaces/<whichever modular u work on>
 pickle27	wiking: yeah yeah
@wiking	pickle27: thnx
@wiking	maybe it does copy it
@wiking	but that still doesn't trigger a rebuild of modshogun.i
@wiking	which i guess is going to be the case
@wiking	as i would need to add some type of a dependency
@wiking	of that target
@wiking	let me know and i'll see
 pickle27	sonney2k: around?
@wiking	btW: anybody knows a way to check the peak memory used by the compiler?
@wiking	not it's not ps aux|grep g++
@wiking	 ? :)
 pickle27	wiking: it doesn't copy
@wiking	pickle27: fucker
@wiking	pickle27: if u run cmake?
 pickle27	wiking: I just ran make
@wiking	try to run cmake
@wiking	just in case
 pickle27	wiking: if I run cmake I'll have t rebuild all of shogun
@wiking	to see if that's effecting it
@wiking	do u
@wiking	?
 pickle27	I think so
@wiking	that'd be weird
@wiking	but ok
 pickle27	I'll try
@wiking	i'll check now
@wiking	because it's a target that should always trigger with simple make
@wiking	hahahah This log is too long to be displayed. Please reduce the verbosity of your build or download the the raw log.
@wiking	ookeeey
 pickle27	wiking: okay re ran cmake with the same flags didn't have t rebuild also didn't copy the file
@wiking	damn cmake
@wiking	ok i'll get back to u
@wiking	if u have time plz fire an issue for this
 pickle27	wiking: I tried deleting build/src/interface/swig_typemaps.i and then it recopied but it didn't rebuild

@HeikoS	one more
@HeikoS	wiking: around?
@HeikoS	wiking: I think for those automagic tests we should activate valgrind and give errors if something is going on
@HeikoS	many of those errors might go through unnoticed otherwise
@wiking	HeikoS: ok
@HeikoS	we are only observing the tip of the iceberg there
@wiking	HeikoS: have u seen this: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10541373#L3717
@wiking	so there even clone_equals_MAPInference clone_equals_DisjointSet is dying as well
@HeikoS	yes thats what I mean
@HeikoS	its that sometimes memory errors give segfaults
@HeikoS	sometimes not
@HeikoS	so rather let valgrind chcek
@wiking	and JSON serialization is just a big mess
@wiking	:)
@wiking	so we are not merging this anytime soon i have a feeling :)
@HeikoS	wiking: well we can go stepwise
@HeikoS	first valgrind the basic tests
@HeikoS	then merge that
@HeikoS	then serialization
@HeikoS	then complex data
@HeikoS	this is tidious fixing uninit memory bugs
@wiking	HeikoS: i wanted to enable valgrind unit testing the problem was with that that openmp-ed tapkee went into infinite loop :)
@HeikoS	wiking: how to print long float aka floatmaxc?
@HeikoS	%f is not good?
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe only the automagic ones for now?
 thoralf	HeikoS: %llllllf ;)
@wiking	%lf
@HeikoS	wiking: ah, thats a bug in clone :)
@wiking	why?
@HeikoS	and long int?
@wiking	$ld
@HeikoS	because I print the numbers sometimes when debugging

@wiking	or %lld

@HeikoS	See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
@HeikoS	(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
@HeikoS	'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	just do this for the moment
@HeikoS	ah still worked
@wiking	git push upstream feature/SerialUTests
@wiking	HeikoS: i suppose that pushed to your own repo
@wiking	and not the upstream ;)
@HeikoS	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun/build$ git push upstream feature/SerialUTests
@HeikoS	error: src refspec feature/SerialUTests does not match any.
@HeikoS	error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git'
@wiking	eh
@HeikoS	ill try a PR
@HeikoS	grrr
@HeikoS	I dont see the branch in github
@HeikoS	at my fork
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	me neither
@wiking	i wonder where u pushed this
@HeikoS	so how to push directly to the feature branch?
@HeikoS	wiking: getting this error above
@wiking	mm
@wiking	wait
@wiking	mmm seems like that
@wiking	so anyways git push upstream feature/SerialUTests
@wiking	should do it
@HeikoS	as said
@HeikoS	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun/build$ git push upstream feature/SerialUTests
@HeikoS	error: src refspec feature/SerialUTests does not match any.
@HeikoS	error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git'
@wiking	yeah that's totally weird
@wiking	as it's there :)))
@wiking	HeikoS: do a git fetch
@wiking	even better
@HeikoS	no help
@HeikoS	git fetch upstream also not help
@wiking	 git fetch upstream feature/SerialUTests
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	that did something but still same error
@HeikoS	maybe via PR
@wiking	but how do u want to pr
@wiking	when it's nowhere
@wiking	i mean your commit is not yet anywhere in github
@HeikoS	wiking: how do I push the local branch to my fork?
@wiking	i guess your fork is name origin
@wiking	because in that case it would be
@wiking	git push origin feature/SerialUTests
@HeikoS	same error
@wiking	mmmm woah
@HeikoS	ah maybe the ubuntu upgrade fucked up something
@HeikoS	how can I check the git upstream settings?
@wiking	what's the output of this
@wiking	git branch
@wiking	HeikoS: .git/config has all the info
@HeikoS	no upstream in there just my email
@HeikoS	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun/build$ git branch
@HeikoS	  dev
@HeikoS	  develop
@HeikoS	  master
@HeikoS	* upstream/feature/SerialUTests
@wiking	oooh fuck
@HeikoS	ah is the upstream too much?
@wiking	yeah created actually a branch called upstream/feature/SerialUTests :D
@wiking	i think
@wiking	:D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	nice
@wiking	remote "upstream"] url = git@github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun.git fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
@wiking	[remote "upstream"] url = git@github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun.git fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
@wiking	this should b somewher in your .git/config
@wiking	HeikoS: if u do this git branch -a
@wiking	do you have something like this
@wiking	  remotes/upstream/feature/SerialUTests
@wiking	if not then add a new remote as upstream
@HeikoS	so now I should just create features/bla rather than upstream/feature/vbla?
@wiking	mmm wait
@wiking	do u have upstream as remote branch?

@wiking	do we serialize this?

@wiking	i'll just rewrite this class a bit
@wiking	with using SGVector shit
@wiking	HeikoS: SG_ADD(SGVector... works right?

 sonne|osx	pickle27: well don't ask to ask ASK!
 pickle27	haha okay
 pickle27	sonne|osx: here is my NDArray type map for octave
 pickle27	the correct array prints from the printf but I get a corrupted double link list error and octave raches
 sonne|osx	pickle27: where and which direction - in our out type map?
 pickle27	sonne|osx: this is the out type map
@wiking	sonne|osx: CPruneVarSubMean(bool divide=true); is actualy the implementation of CPruneVarSubMean(); ?

@HeikoS	m_idx=SGVector<bla>()
@wiking	HeikoS: m_mean = SGVector<float64_t>();
@HeikoS	unrefs existing, sets array to NULL and length to 0
@sonney2k	pickle27, I mean the valgrind output - where is it?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	this should be equivalent to array=NULL, array_len=0
 pickle27	sonney2k: I am just rebuilding so I can run it, I had some other debug stuff in there
@HeikoS	in old style
@wiking	HeikoS: would that be calling free on the inner struct?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes since it unrefs it

@sonney2k	pickle27, shouldn't it be dim_vector vdims(num_dims); ?
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: hey!
@HeikoS	how is it going?
 lambday	HeikoS: phew! just got out of the lab!
@HeikoS	lambday: just ported the ozone sampler to python
 lambday	HeikoS: probing is almost done
@HeikoS	lambday: and I got the PBS computation engine working in python
@HeikoS	lambday: wow!
@HeikoS	cool!
 lambday	HeikoS: do you think we should keep the matrix power module in another class hierarchy ?
 pickle27	sonney2k: its gives a deprecated warning if I do that, plus it was done with dim_vector(1,len) for the SGVector typemap
@HeikoS	what are you working on?
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, in CMath
 lambday	HeikoS: as a static method?
@HeikoS	lambday: I guess thats best?
 lambday	HeikoS: wow!!!!
 pickle27	sonney2k: so I just did the same waya
 lambday	HeikoS: yes.. I think so..
@sonney2k	pickle27, doesn't make sense to me
 lambday	I think I can manage it with log(n) multiplication instead of n for power n of a matrix
 pickle27	sonney2k: yeah confuses me too, but both Vector and Matrix typemaps are like that
 lambday	at the cost of O(1) extra storage
 pickle27	also I can't even find the docs for the dim_vector(int, int) constructor its not in doxygen
 pickle27	for octave
 lambday	but since its just once every time LogDetEstimator is run (and only within the precompute of the sampler), we can afford that
@HeikoS	lambday: sweet!
@sonney2k	pickle27, you should really use dim_vector(dims)
@HeikoS	lambday: thats really good news
@iglesiasg	see you later people
 lambday	HeikoS: so, regarding multiple implementation of matrix power, how should I do that??
 pickle27	sonney2k: do you mean dims or num_dims?
@HeikoS	lambday: Daniel and the others never solved it that nice :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: bye!
@sonney2k	pickle27, maybe dim_vector.alloc(dims) is the new way but certainly not dim_vector(1,foo) or so
@HeikoS	lambday: what do you mean?
@sonney2k	pickle27, num_dims
@sonney2k	pickle27, try dim_vector.alloc(num_dism)
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay
 lambday	HeikoS: I am not too sure :( let me finish it first then I'll celebrate with Rum and Beer :D
@HeikoS	haha :D
 lambday	HeikoS: we will have two different implementations of matrix powers, right?
@HeikoS	lambday: will be going for beer soon, too
@HeikoS	lambday: which are?

@HeikoS	lambday: ah
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	lambday: direct one is just std product right?
@sonney2k	lambday, :: of course instead of .
 lambday	sonney2k: HeikoS.. no no :-/
 lambday	I mean, I can't think of two different signatures
@HeikoS	lambday: I am confused
 lambday	except for a param
@sonney2k	lambday, what?
@HeikoS	lambday: make it two methods
 lambday	errr I am confused two
 lambday	yes
 lambday	and then an extra param
 lambday	for one
 lambday	right?
@HeikoS	ye
@HeikoS	p
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	I see but you want it to be polymorphic
 lambday	I don't like it - that is the problem
 lambday	yes :D
@HeikoS	common interface
@HeikoS	lambday: then make it a class
@HeikoS	in math
@sonney2k	pickle27, I am pretty confident that this will work
 lambday	in math itself?
@HeikoS	thats nicer anyway
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	in the folder
 lambday	alright yes I was thinking about that
@wiking	HeikoS: vector = new_vector
@sonney2k	pickle27, ohh and please change the other dim_vectors too then to fix the deprecated...
@wiking	HeikoS: thi sis releasing the old memory + and refs new_vector?
 lambday	I thought of fitting in current COperatorFunction only but it won't fit
@HeikoS	wiking: yes
@HeikoS	wiking: its all copy by value but still magic
 pickle27	sonney2k: if it works for sure
@sonney2k	pickle27, so does it work?
 pickle27	sonney2k: still building
 pickle27	sonney2k: rebuilding modular takes a while
@sonney2k	it all takes too long now
@sonney2k	it the more c++y we write the code the longer it will take
 pickle27	sonney2k: looks like the same bug as before
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe thats good
@HeikoS	sparsematrix operator?
 lambday	HeikoS: today I had a meeting with Intel US people, and surprisingly my supervisor introduced me as the GSoC guy (in a sense that its a strong point to support that I can do a little bit of programming)
 lambday	lol... :D
 lambday	surprising :D
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
@HeikoS	lambday: so they like it after all :)
@sonney2k	pickle27, cannot be? you sure it took the right lib?
@HeikoS	you should show them your awesome framework to support that
@sonney2k	pickle27, .so I mean?
 lambday	HeikoS: let's hope so.. :D
 pickle27	sonney2k: I rebuilt and ran sudo make install again
 lambday	HeikoS: so different class it is...
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	lambday: no why not linear operator?
@sonney2k	pickle27, then please show the valgrind output
@HeikoS	just has to be documented
 lambday	within linear operator itself?
 lambday	umm yeah that might be a good idea!
 lambday	and also, the CSparseMatrixOperator will have a method that returns its sparsity structure that will be passed to the coloring interface
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah why not, might be useful
 lambday	sexy!
 pickle27	sonney2k: http://pastebin.com/wqge0B6q
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
 pickle27	sonney2k: I am going to try with a int_32 cast on the vdim loop
@sonney2k	pickle27, try to use num_dims+1
@sonney2k	when allocating the vector
@sonney2k	pickle27, the cast won't help
 lambday	HeikoS: hopefully these all be done by this week..
@sonney2k	and doesn't hurt either though
 pickle27	okay
 lambday	HeikoS: oh and wiking and I were talking about the parallel implementation of our computation engine...
 pickle27	I'll try the cast and then try the +1
@HeikoS	lambday: yes a bit
@sonney2k	lambday, btw please make n a int64_t
@HeikoS	lambday: as said, I am writing the thing in python to experiment with it
@HeikoS	will share soon, once it is working
 lambday	sonney2k: n as in matrix power?
@HeikoS	its more or less your interface
@sonney2k	matrices might be bigger but on the other hand IDK whether octave supports 64bit matrices
@sonney2k	lambday, prod(dims(tensor)) == num_elements
@sonney2k	no :)
 lambday	tensor?? :-o
* lambday drops his jaws
@sonney2k	n-dimensional array if you want to relax :)
 lambday	HeikoS: wiking  was suggesting that hadoop can be a better alternative than mpi
@HeikoS	lambday: yep might be
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact, I also just used FS rather than sockets etc
@HeikoS	lets start with PBS
@wiking	lambday: not better just another :)
@HeikoS	since many people have access to that
@HeikoS	most useful
@HeikoS	although a bit of overhead in there
 lambday	sonney2k: I am confused :-/ you meant the matrix datatype to be of int64 or the matrix dim to be int64? :(
 lambday	HeikoS: I don't have much idea regarding this... I am hoping I'll learn as we start implementing it

@HeikoS	lambday: yes
@HeikoS	lambday: keep in mind they copy though
@HeikoS	lambday: so not good for computing trace
 lambday	HeikoS: as of now I'll leave everything as it is since they work..
 sonne|osx	lambday: I am on all arches now
 sonne|osx	archs
@HeikoS	lambday: yes better
 lambday	later I'll think of optimization
 sonne|osx	3 machines running :/
 lambday	sonne|osx: you are God :)
 sonne|osx	which reminds me I should order that ovh machine
@HeikoS	dude too many computers
 sonne|osx	lambday: yeah I feel like one
 sonne|osx	;)
 sonne|osx	alright I take a short break
 lambday	and I can't even fuckin' buy my Thinkpad :'(
 sonne|osx	pickle27: post your news if you have any!
@wiking	yey
@wiking	HeikoS: we need such a test for serialization :)
@wiking	HeikoS: i mean no sane class would have an empty file
@wiking	HeikoS: although not so true
@wiking	mmm dunno how we could test this :)
@HeikoS	wiking: thats easy, test that nzumber of registered parameters is positive :)
@wiking	sonne|osx: there's a problem with XML serialization implementation
@wiking	sonne|osx: xml schema does not allow to have <tag name>.... as name would be taken as an attribute
@HeikoS	wiking:  but we cannot check if class members are registered
@HeikoS	impossible
@wiking	sonne|osx: but we are doing like <tag name></tag name>
@wiking	and obviously libxml freaks out :)

@wiking	heheheh cool
@wiking	integration test failed with prunesubvar
@wiking	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10548060
@wiking	ideas: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/10548060#L3655
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	i get it data should be updated :)
 pickle27	wiking:
 pickle27	the deprecated error should be changed to dim_vector.alloc(int n) rather than using the constructor
 pickle27	I don't know what the plus is about
@wiking	pickle27: what's octave_allocation_error?
@wiking	curr_sym_tab
@wiking	global_sym_tab
@wiking	are these some globals in octave?
 pickle27	wiking: I really have no idea
@wiking	heheh ok
@wiking	i'll see
@wiking	oh maaan
@wiking	i need to do some regexp on that #define OCTAVE_APIVERSION api-v48+
@wiking	:P
@wiking	as i have like #if OCTAVE_APIVERSION < 37
@wiking	in src/interfaces/octave_static/OctaveInterface.cpp
@wiking	`octave-config -p API_VERSION | tr -d 'a-z-+'`
@wiking	hehe this hack
 pickle27	wiking: those errors looked more like static interface errors though
 pickle27	see if any of that stuff is defined in there
@wiking	pickle27: now i know why it's errored
 pickle27	wiking: yah?
@wiking	the way i defined the OCTAVE_APIVERSION is not the way it was in the old ./configure
@wiking	i have to fix that with a regexp

@wiking	sonney2k: u dont want to allow that some variable can be redefined from cmd line?
@sonney2k	wiking, if I have if ( var_name MATCHES foo ) then varname might expand to the variable content
@sonney2k	wiking, no
@wiking	sonney2k: oh... i thought only if you do ${varname}
@wiking	that's only when it expands
 sonne|osx	wiking: no
@wiking	but seems not
@wiking	:(
@sonney2k	wiking, http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Language_Syntax
@sonney2k	When CMake wants a variable name, when it wants a substitution.
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmhh whatever maybe I don't need to solve this
@wiking	what? :D
@wiking	sonney2k: fix the integration test plz
@sonney2k	wiking, what?
@wiking	sonney2k: as i cannot generate the right data on my osx :S
@sonney2k	who did break them?
@wiking	sonney2k: well now that i've fixed prunesubvar
@wiking	obviously the deserialization file changed
@wiking	as until now it was empty basically
@wiking	;)
@wiking	sonney2k: so i 'broke' them :)
@wiking	but then again this was expected as prunesubvarmean was not saving anything until now ;P

@sonney2k	wiking, I still have just parse error
@sonney2k	wiking, what do you mean?
@sonney2k	pickle27, did you get it fixed?
 pickle27	sonney2k: not yet
@wiking	sonney2k: ?
@wiking	sonney2k: parse errors of...?
@sonney2k	wiking, what is not working exactly?
 pickle27	sonney2k: looking at some octave source right now because the dim_vector is not actually 3 dimensions even though it should be given the argument to alloc

 pickle27	here is the source
 pickle27	http://octave.sourceforge.net/doxygen/html/df/dd3/dim-vector_8h_source.html#l00236
 pickle27	sonney2k: am I correct in thinking this means that when n is less than 2 the vector is 2 in length
@wiking	sonney2k: integration test for prunevarmean needs to be fixed....
 pickle27	sonney2k: or is it the other way and if its bigger than 2 they force it to 2 because that te behaviour Im seeing
@wiking	sonney2k: and on osx the integration test are failing... regardless of what's the state now... so we need a debian/linux machine to generate those tests
@sonney2k	wiking, yes so please run python generator.py name_of_prunevarsubmean.py
@wiking	sonney2k: i dont have linux :(
@wiking	sonney2k: if i generate it on my osx it'll fail on all the bots
@sonney2k	wiking, ah so why does it fail on osx then?
@wiking	sonney2k: well it's a good question but it fails all the time... i mean it always failed
@wiking	sonney2k: i think it's some rounding error or something

@wiking	heh we have an error in structure/BeliefPropagation.cpp
@wiking	oh woah since when do we allow to have #include <vector> and #include <set> in .h?
@sonney2k	we don't but D-ptrs to the rescue!
@wiking	sonney2k: shogun/structure/BeliefPropagation.h
@wiking	it's full with STL
 pickle27	sonney2k: fixed it!
 pickle27	twas a silly mistake by me
@sonney2k	pickle27, what was it?
 pickle27	sonney2k: dim_vector.alloc returns a dim_vector so I was just using it wrong
@sonney2k	pickle27, errm what did you write and you do write now?
@sonney2k	code lines please
 pickle27	before I had dim_vector vdim;
 pickle27	vdim.alloc(num_dims)
 pickle27	now I have
 pickle27	dim_vector vdim = dim_vector::alloc(num_dims);
@sonney2k	pickle27, ahh ok
@sonney2k	sure thing then
@sonney2k	pickle27, good that you realized the mistake!
 pickle27	sonney2k: it works now although octave squashes the ND array back into 2D
 pickle27	sonney2k: can you have 3D array's in octave? you must be able to
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay yes you can have 3D arrays in octave
 pickle27	sonney2k: looks like I need to do something different for this wrapper, but it does work without error now
@sonney2k	pickle27, and ndims(your_array) says what?
@sonney2k	pickle27,
@sonney2k	a(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)=1
@sonney2k	a =  1
@sonney2k	octave:3> ndims(a)
@sonney2k	ans =  2
@sonney2k	 a(1,1,1,1,1,1,2)=1
@sonney2k	ndims(a)
@sonney2k	ans =  7
@sonney2k	so it depends how your data looks like
@sonney2k	wiking, no idea I am unable to commit
@sonney2k	wiking, push I mean
@wiking	sonney2k: why not/
 pickle27	sonney2k: it should be 2x2x4 but it comes out as 2x8
@sonney2k	new setup is still WIP
@wiking	:D
@sonney2k	pickle27, well try some 5d matrix or so with the latest dim > 1
@sonney2k	anyway bed time
@sonney2k	cu
 pickle27	later
