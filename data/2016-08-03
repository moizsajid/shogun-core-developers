 sanuj	wiking, `#cmakedefine HAVE_JINJA2 @JINJA2_FOUND@` is not setting HAVE_JINJA2
 sanuj	i'm using
 sanuj	#define HAVE_JINJA2 @JINJA2_FOUND@
 sanuj	http://public.kitware.com/pipermail/cmake/2011-March/043464.html
 sanuj	even #define is not able to set it
@wiking	sanuj, i explained in that PR
@wiking	that you should SET
@wiking	a variable
@wiking	IF(JINJA2_FOUND)
@wiking	set(HAVE_JINJA2 1)
@wiking	ENDIF()
 sanuj	wiking, okay thanks
 sanuj	!!
@wiking	i mean
@wiking	there are like
@wiking	50 examples
@wiking	in that CMakeLists.txt file
@wiking	that does the very same thing
@wiking	it's ok if you dont know
@wiking	but it's not that ok that you dont follow something that is in the code itself
@wiking	these are my 2 cents
 sanuj	wiking, i didn't know
@wiking	yaeh that's fine
 sanuj	so there is
 sanuj	IF (CURL_FOUND)
 sanuj	SET(HAVE_CURL 1)
@wiking	again the problem is there are like million of these particular examples
@wiking	in that file
 sanuj	and then in config.h.in
 sanuj	#cmakedefine HAVE_CURL 1
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	like that
@wiking	exactly
 sanuj	wiking, cool

@wiking	c4goldsw, how's going?
 c4goldsw	wiking I'm good, how are you?
@wiking	good good
@wiking	working on scijs :)
 c4goldsw	scijs?
@wiking	i.e. creating shogun a javascript interface
 c4goldsw	Oh cool!
@wiking	and be able to use javascript for you data science tasks
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i thought it's bs
@wiking	but then when i twitted yesterday abou tit
@wiking	people went crazy about it :)
@wiking	so that's good
@wiking	:)
 c4goldsw	Where would it run from?
@wiking	nodejs
 c4goldsw	Ah, ok.
@wiking	nono no way i wanna do ML in browser
@wiking	:))))
 c4goldsw	Haha, good.
@wiking	it's just that instead of R or python
@wiking	why not JS?
 c4goldsw	Fair enough - that would provide a good entry point for a lot of web dev people who want to muddle around.
 c4goldsw	Just redid the LARS clean up patch (after Heikos comments).  I'm about to send in a PR for a templated LDA.
 c4goldsw	Well, not templated, but it can support different floating point types.
@wiking	that's great!
 c4goldsw	wiking Do you do Kaggle competions?  Just curious.  I've started getting into it myself.
@wiking	hehe not really
@wiking	no time
@wiking	and quite frankly
@wiking	most of the solutions there are very bruteforce ones
@wiking	i rarely saw an elegant solution
 c4goldsw	Interesting - I'll keep that in mind.

@wiking	i mean usually i see
@wiking	people generating
@wiking	KAZIILIONS of features
@wiking	and then do usually extreme boosting
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking, for my tags jinja PR, shall i add a test in python_modular to check if things work. (it works on my local)
@wiking	is it possible to add a meta example for testing this?
 sanuj	wiking, do meta examples test python etc?
 sanuj	i think they only do cpp integration testing currently
@wiking	fuck yeah
@wiking	:(
@wiking	yeah then lets have a fixture for python
 sanuj	wiking, okay!
@wiking	thnx
 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeap
 sanuj	lisitsyn, shogun-base.i when generated looks like https://gist.github.com/sanuj/a85986fb35052de761ac251496e90e90
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we still have not decided what to do with shogun templates

 sanuj	wiking, what happens to data that is returned in python_modular integration tests?
 sanuj	is it necessary to return something?
@wiking	what do yo umean?
 sanuj	wiking, every modular test has a function that returns something
 sanuj	is it saved somewhere like it is done for the new meta integration tests??
@wiking	the data that is being used for python_modular
@wiking	or any modular tests
@wiking	are in the data submodule
@wiking	just like in case of the meta examples
 sanuj	okay, let me see
 sanuj	wiking, so it's in data/testsuite/python2-tests
 sanuj	how is the data generated for the very first time
 sanuj	or for my tags modular test, shall i just test that it compiles?
@wiking	what do you mean generated for the first time?
@wiking	i mean i'm not so sure if i can follow what you mean here
@wiking	for python_modular tests the data residing in data submodule is being used
@wiking	see for example
@wiking	~/shogun/examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_multiclassliblinear_modular.py
 sanuj	wiking, what i mean is, suppose i just added a test called tags_params_modular.py which has a function which returns some data
@wiking	doesn't need to return data
@wiking	it just should run an exit 0
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	i mean in tags cars
@wiking	i mean in tags case
@wiking	you just wanna create an object
@wiking	where you do .sets() and .gets()
@wiking	check that what you set is the same that you get
 sanuj	wiking, yep, so no worrying about data then
@wiking	and texit
@wiking	*exit
@wiking	you just want to test the tags part
@wiking	and for that you dont really need that
@wiking	*data
@wiking	just to be able to use the tags backend from modular interface
 sanuj	wiking, so it will only fail if it doesn't compile?
 sanuj	if i check for equality in the test, and if it's not equal
 sanuj	then how to make it fail?
@wiking	no
@wiking	it will fail
@wiking	if there's a problem with the generated interface
