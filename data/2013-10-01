 wiking	besser82: hey
 besser82	wiking: Mornin'  :D
 besser82	wiking: I'll start pre-configuring the appliance, after my first coffee  :)
 besser82	wiking: Like setting up yum-config to act like apt-get
 wiking	besser82: so we have now a shell access?
 wiking	besser82: if so could u share with me the ip?
 besser82	wiking: me, yes.  You and sonne|work  withing new hour  :)
 wiking	ah ok
 besser82	wiking: sure
 besser82	https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/4032
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k, sonne|work:  ^^^^
 wiking	besser82: ah ok....
 wiking	cool
 wiking	i guess u have to install our keys later
 besser82	wiking: no, that's handled by some automagic  ;)
 besser82	wiking: there's a special FAS-group "shogun-ca", I just added you to
 wiking	besser82: [~] $ ssh 209.132.184.157                                                                                                                                       [wiking@welitron:~]
 besser82	wiking: and gave you perms to add other users as well :)
 wiking	wiking@209.132.184.157's password:
 wiking	i.e. it's asking for a passwd
 wiking	not trying to auth with the key
 besser82	wiking: As I said ~1h it will take ;)
 wiking	ah cool
 wiking	okok
 wiking	i'm off to sort out some paper works
 wiking	so brb
 wiking	thnx heaps for this !

 lisitsyn	sonne|work: don't you think they should get back to working state soon?
 besser82	wiking: around?
 besser82	sonne|work: vm is up and running, but lacks persistent storage, yet :(
 besser82	sonne|work: after this is setup by kevin (nirik) you and wiking should have ssh access.
 besser82	sonne|work: Does Heiko and Fernando need ssh access, too?
 besser82	wiking: Which httpd we should run on the iPython instace?
 besser82	wiking: I'd tend to nginx with python-socket
 besser82	wiking: and running all nbs through a socket, which runs them on a limited user
 besser82	wiking: like in guest_u domain
 besser82	wiking: so there can't be done any severe harm to the system
 besser82	wiking: guest_u domian has no networking, no /proc /sys /dev access, just enough perms to rum some shell script inside it's own $HOME
@HeikoS	sonne|work, sonney2k sorry for yesterday, something came in between
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: besser82: wiking: sonne|work: 10:00 UTC+2
 lisitsyn	correct?
 lisitsyn	friday
 lisitsyn	does it work for all of you?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, doodle showed my local time :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it changes what timezone it shows like hell :(
@HeikoS	I know, but I got it right htis time
 lisitsyn	ok
 besser82	HeikoS: do you need ssh access to the new ipython server too?
@HeikoS	besser82: I think I dont for now
 besser82	HeikoS: kk

 sonne|work	besser82: nice nice. I will have a look tonight
 besser82	wiking, sonne|work: around?
 sonne|work	besser82: yes
 sonne|work	besser82: whats up?
 besser82	sonne|work: is there any preference which httpd to use on the new vm?
 besser82	sonne|work: I'd tend to use nginx
 sonne|work	I too but I think wiking will set it up
 besser82	sonne|work: I can do it ,too ;)
 sonne|work	so we better ask him
 besser82	sonne|work: kk
 besser82	sonne|work: would make security lots easier
 sonne|work	besser82: well wiking did the image already
 sonne|work	apache is too slow
 besser82	sonne|work: image?
 sonne|work	he had some image where we could run ipython notebooks from
 besser82	sonne|work: I see
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm asking because I setup a local vm here and did some testing
 besser82	sonne|work: and I finally manged to lock it down pretty tough
 besser82	sonne|work: securitywise
 sonne|work	besser82: we need wiking for that
 besser82	sonne|work: Sure, I'll wait  :)  Just wanted to share some progress
 wiking	besser82: i dont care about http
 wiking	as we'll have to use some kind of a proxy anyways for the ipython tornado based webservice
 besser82	wiking: so you would be fine with nginx && python-socket-proxy?
 besser82	wiking: Good!  :D
 wiking	sure
 besser82	wiking: So lockdown (security) can be real piece of cake with selinux  ;)
 besser82	wiking: like running the whole python-cgi as a "guest_u" user ;)
 besser82	wiking: What do you think?
 wiking	besser82: we dont need python-cgi
 wiking	besser82: ipython notebook runs it's own tornado based webservice
 besser82	wiking: I see...
 besser82	wiking: But we need some way to lock it down somehow....
 besser82	wiking: any ideas?
 wiking	besser82: well there's no real security thing with ipython
 wiking	hence i though i'm going to make a registration based service
 wiking	and that's the 'security'
 wiking	otherwise i told you that we need to have the whole system r/o
 wiking	and then there's only a few things once can do with that service
 besser82	wiking: or run it as a locked down user
 wiking	yeah possible
 besser82	wiking: i'll dive into ipy nb config...
 besser82	wiking: ilike there's any possibility to spawn processes with a seperate uid/gid
 besser82	wiking: which will run with real  locked down privileges...
 besser82	wiking: SElinux "guest_u"
