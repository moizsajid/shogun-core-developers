 kislay	hi lisitsyn
 kislay	lisitsyn1, Hi
 lisitsyn1	kislay: hey
 kislay	lisitsyn1, I am quite stuck at the GP notebook1
 kislay	lisitsyn1,  I couldn't run GradientModelSelection class in python interface. It keeps on returning "NameError: name 'GradientModelSelection' is not defined".
 kislay	lisitsyn1, how could this be possible??
 lisitsyn1	kislay: maybe eigen3 is missing?
 kislay	lisitsyn1, But the other class on  GridSearchModelSelection is there.
 lisitsyn1	grid search doesn't depend on eigen
 kislay	lisitsyn1, but I am using shogun for a month now and the first thing I did before installation is installing eigen3
 lisitsyn1	#ifdef HAVE_NLOPT
 lisitsyn1	kislay: it needs nlopt then
 kislay	lisitsyn1, Should I install it separately?
 lisitsyn1	yes
 kislay	lisitsyn1, okay. Thanks . I will try to get around this error. :)
