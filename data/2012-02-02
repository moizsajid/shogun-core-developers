 blackburn	sonne|work: the idea of any merging smells like a lot of pain in ass :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: it is easy if someone just wants to contribute missing methods to shogun
 sonne|work	otherwise very difficult agreed
 blackburn	do you think he intended contributing to shogun?
 blackburn	sonne|work: one idea I have is to suggest him to link his dimensionality reduction with EDRT
 sonne|work	the other alternative is he just wraps shogun objects in his tools
 blackburn	sonne|work: how long does review by EIC editor take?
 sonne|work	EIC?
 blackburn	editor in chief or so
 blackburn	first stage in jmlr reviewing
 blackburn	I'm just curious how much time does it take
 sonne|work	lawrence is rather fast
 sonne|work	but the process will take between 3 and 6 months I would expect
 blackburn	!&@%
 blackburn	completely crazy, why so much?
 blackburn	the only paper accepted in next month was gaussian processes toolkit
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/rasmussen10a/rasmussen10a.pdf
 blackburn	submitted 8/10
 blackburn	revised 9/10
 blackburn	published 11/10
 sonne|work	it takes time to find action editors, it takes time to find reviewers, it takes time to get reviews, render decision, get the final version
 blackburn	sonne|work: I see..
 blackburn	sonne|work: in next 6 months I would implement more methods and paper would be outdated hah
 sonne|work	that's life
 blackburn	sonne|work: oh, EIC (lawrence) is an author of locally linear embedding :)

 Ram108	blackburn:hi
 blackburn	Ram108: hi
 Ram108	i have almost finished the neural network-backpropagation algorithm
 Ram108	i have a little more to make it complete though
 Ram108	how do i make it shogun-like?
 blackburn	well just take a look on any classifier
 blackburn	at least it should have methods train and apply :)
 Ram108	make it similar to any of those right?
 Ram108	lol yeah it has :)
 Ram108	hmmm i ll modify the algorithm as per the requirement and email it to u :)
 Ram108	would that be fine?
 blackburn	well pull request using github is preferrable
 Ram108	oh okay i ll do that :)
 Ram108	thanks :)
 Ram108	have a great day :)
 Ram108	by the way what else can i do?
 Ram108	this project was really fun
 Ram108	lol
 Ram108	do u have any problems at hand i could read upon and implement?
 blackburn	not really
 Ram108	hmmm thanks anyway :)
 blackburn	but take a look on github issues for shogun
 blackburn	there are some ideas
 Ram108	oh cool :) i ll do that :)
 blackburn	in fact they are a little complex
 blackburn	but at first we would have to polish your code
 Ram108	i think am getting the hang of it....... lol i ll do that :)
 Ram108	by the way what is generally required for me to get into GSOC 2012? i mean is there any pre-requisite?
 Ram108	i ll email u the code before i use github
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	you would have to contact your possible mentor
 Ram108	oh hmmm well mr soren?
 Ram108	lol? but do u think its a little too late for that?
 Ram108	i guess u r busy......... i ll contact u later then......... :)
 Ram108	thanks for ur time :)
 blackburn	sorry
 Ram108	thats okay lol i understand :)
 blackburn	hang on :)
 Ram108	sure :)
 blackburn	it is not too late to contact mentors
 blackburn	gsoc wasn't announced yet
 blackburn	so we didn't even create list of possible ideas
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 Ram108	okay
 Ram108	thanks
 Ram108	by the way hw r u doin?
 blackburn	fine, and you? ;)
 Ram108	am doin great jusy busy thats all lol :)
 Ram108	just*

 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.96.90.84] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 n4nd0	hey
 n4nd0	I am having some trouble with the command addpath in octave
 n4nd0	it doesn't seem to make the same job as it does in matlab
 n4nd0	has anyone seen that before?
 blackburn	unfortunately no
 n4nd0	:(
 n4nd0	it looks like it adds the directory I am giving it correctly to the path, I have checked it with the command path
 n4nd0	but it doesn't find the files that are there
 n4nd0	let's see what I can do
 blackburn	n4nd0: why do you need it?
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.99.36.130] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	blackburn, it is for the directory to the training images
 n4nd0	blackburn, instead of copying the one of my previous lab again to the working directory I am using now, I wanted just to use the one there
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn, mmm I don't know if I explained me clearly
 blackburn	btw yesterday I told you to create features.m too
 blackburn	you could avoid it
 blackburn	just create some feature matrix and store
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.99.36.130] has quit [Client Quit]
 blackburn	then you could do only classifica
 blackburn	tion
 blackburn	in some script
 n4nd0	I have already ported almost all the functions that I use to get the features from the images so it is not a problem ;)
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	sounds promising :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: for the moment I could tell you that possible gsoc ideas would include gaussian processes and structured output learning
 n4nd0	blackburn, good, thanks :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, I don't know about structured output learning but I could take it a look
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have more experience with Gaussian processes, they appear everywhere!!
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	well then you could submit your proposal about GPs
 n4nd0	we'll see
 n4nd0	are you applying as well?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	what is your project?
 n4nd0	dimensionality reduction?
 blackburn	I don't know yet
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	let's see if I am soon done with this part and I start working with shogun in python to try out different classifiers
 blackburn	sure
