 marina	hello everybody, I am using the weightedDegreePositinoStringKernel - and that works for training the sum ... but now I want the explicit feature depiction.
 marina	I think, that is what CWDFeatures() makes
 marina	but when I use it, I got an error: NameError: "name 'CWDFeatures' is not defined"
 marina	can you help me?
 marina	and I imported shogun.Features
