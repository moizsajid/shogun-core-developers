@HeikoS	would be great

@HeikoS	wiking: there is a list of topics in the googledoc
@HeikoS	talk topics
@HeikoS	we just need a vote on them
@HeikoS	with email and name, institution
@wiking	HeikoS: and how can i help in that
@wiking	i mean the last time i used some free service
@wiking	to do that
@HeikoS	(and a checkbox for each "attending main day" "attending hands on"
@HeikoS	yeah fine
@HeikoS	just to distribute the work a bit
@wiking	afaicr
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah see our website for how the thing looked like
@HeikoS	wiking: btw there is a new issue on github that me and dino just ran into this morhing, could you also have a look, maybe you know a nice fix (that doesnt involve re-compile python as google suggests)?
@wiking	?
@wiking	no iea
@HeikoS	wiking: our website has the workshop 2013 page
@wiking	no idea about that
@HeikoS	wiking: the issue?
@HeikoS	or the poll?
@HeikoS	:)
@wiking	issue
@HeikoS	ah I see, some ubuntu bug of the new "stable" version
@HeikoS	annoying
@wiking	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013
@wiking	you mean the registration form/
@wiking	?
@wiking	it wasn't done by me
@wiking	dunno who created taht
@wiking	but seems that's like a google spreadshite somehow embedded into the page
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	wiking: if you could figure that out and do, that would be of great help
@wiking	but i have no idea how that was done

@HeikoS	wiking: any other idea for a simple vote?
@HeikoS	doesnt hav eto be super nice
@wiking	i reckon it'd be better to find out how this was done and just copy-paste the gdocs
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, exactly
@wiking	i reckon it's better to ask about this on the mailinglist :)
@HeikoS	wiking: just am so busy with organising the other things about the workshop. Would be cool to get some help with this Could you push this to be done today or tomorrow? we need this asap
@HeikoS	wiking: mailing list doesnt reply currently, better figure out self

@HeikoS	wiking: for the talks, I think its necessary that a) somebody knows about stuff (though I am happy to talk about anything) b) it is in shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: so does shogun have filtering things?
@HeikoS	we dont even have PCA/SVD with missing values :)
@HeikoS	(though I issued that a while ago for parijat ;) )

@wiking	i saw movielens dataset imported
@wiking	or that was pre-gsoc
@wiking	what's wu lin working on?
@wiking	ah no he is gp+kl -ing
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, one can use this for CF, but we kind of are focussing on other stuff (its in the list of talks)
@HeikoS	wiking: ok thanks for pushing the vote, if you see fernando, dont let him go until he did that (and the website workshop update)

 parijat	HeikoS: Hello... do you have a min?
 parijat	HeikoS: can you please have a look at this PR : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2316 .
@HeikoS	parijat:  sure
 parijat	HeikoS: the SG_ADD is failing SerializationAscii test and SerializationJSON tests
 parijat	HeikoS: see travis here : https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/28204350
@HeikoS	parijat: whats the type of m_delta?
 parijat	HeikoS: float64_t
@HeikoS	parijat: implement std constructor and make it call init
@HeikoS	that should solve it
@HeikoS	its a check for that, makes sure you initialise your variables for all constructors ;)
@HeikoS	parijat: in the code, you only initialise with non-std constructor
 parijat	HeikoS: but this constructor is supposed to be std constructor overloaded..
 parijat	HeikoS: isn't it?
@HeikoS	parijat: I might be wrong, but I dont see
@HeikoS	CHuberLoss::CHuberLoss() {init;}
@HeikoS	CHuberLoss::CHuberLoss() {init();}
@HeikoS	sorry
 parijat	HeikoS: I actually overloaded 2 constructors by using default value : CHuberLoss(float64_t delta=CMath::MAX_REAL_NUMBER)
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.200.188.80] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@HeikoS	parijat: I see, sorry
@HeikoS	parijat: double check whether the delta is initialised when you call emptry
@HeikoS	just to be sure
@HeikoS	otherwise you will have to debug to find out
@HeikoS	only thing that I can think of
@HeikoS	check whats the difference in the unit test
 parijat	HeikoS: ok let me see... The error you say is mostly caused by values not being initialized properly right?
@HeikoS	parijat: yes
 parijat	HeikoS: alright! Thanks for helping out.. :)

@HeikoS	pickle27: alright
 pickle27	I have write access on the github repo
@HeikoS	pickle27: what does this mean?
 pickle27	I can merge PRs on github that change the code
 pickle27	some people have access to the admin and can edit the db entries
 pickle27	but only sonney2k can redeploy the page afaik
@HeikoS	pickle27: I want a new page, content is already written
 pickle27	I think sonney2k can give you access to the django admin and then you can add it there

@HeikoS	iglesiasg: hi!
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: good to see you! :)
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: were just talking about you and sent you an email
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: yep, I saw :)
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: I am checking Parijat's PR
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: anyhow
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: the weorkshop thing should have priority #1 for now
@HeikoS	at least until the registration works and program is online
@HeikoS	rest can be figured out later
@HeikoS	but we need the website for the registration event and the call for participation email
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: I was going to mail Soeren and Kevin about that because I cannot alter any content on the website
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: just talked to pickle27, he also cannot do that
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: this is a pending issue for some weeks now
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: just emailed s?ren, lets hope he gets back
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: Ah,
 iglesiasg	yeah, kevin told me that. We need Soeren it seems
 pickle27	its a very complicated setup at the moment
 iglesiasg	pickle27: but I am wondering -- so it isn't possible to add new users either?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: you were changing things earlier didnt you?
 pickle27	a lot of that website is specifically configured for that server
 pickle27	it is possible but I think soeren has to do it, at least I don't know how
@HeikoS	pickle27: yeah, but for now that doesnt matter, we just need to add one item
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: yes, but then pickle27 took over for the website -- which was very good since I suck at web
@HeikoS	pickle27, iglesiasg just mailed him twice
 pickle27	I also don't have access at the moment because my admin account on the site got cleared when we shipped the update this fall
 pickle27	I have a totally new version that I am working on
@HeikoS	iglesiasg, pickle27 thing is we really need to add this site somehow. So lets email s?ren until he gives rights to all of us :)
 pickle27	it will be easier to change :)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: website access !!!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: see my emails
 pickle27	HeikoS, I haven't shown you yet
 iglesiasg	the thing is that my username and password still work
 pickle27	here is the new version of the site I've been playing with
 pickle27	http://shogun-web.herokuapp.com/
 iglesiasg	but I get this message
@HeikoS	pickle27: cool, looking forward to see this :)
 iglesiasg	Site administration  You don't have permission to edit anything.
 pickle27	iglesiasg, I don't even have an account any more
 iglesiasg	argh weird stuff
@HeikoS	pickle27: ah nice, looking forward to use this one
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you send sonney2k an email?
@HeikoS	pickle27: and you too?
 pickle27	I replied to that email
@HeikoS	pickle27: saw it, lets hope :)
 pickle27	HeikoS, yeah it is much simpler and has no database so to edit content you just make a PR to github
@HeikoS	yeah totally
 pickle27	less layers will be easier to maintain
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: did you do the voting last year?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: independent of yes or no, could you set one up? asked wiking but he did not do this last time
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: also very urgent
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: Sergey did this
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: he used some google doc I think
 iglesiasg	he set up a form using google docs
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: would you mind doing this this year?
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: with voting you mean for the topics of the talks?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes we have a list in the googledoc
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: ok
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: also feel free to change/add
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cool thanks
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: about RF talk
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: if we add this to the votes and poeple vote on it, would you be interested in talking about basics? and show sshogun notebook demos?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: its just 30 mins, so you can only cover basics anyways

 yorkerlin	@HeikoS I am working on some unit tests of the dual KL inference. Once they are passed, I will send  PRs for the KL method. (including variational Dual Likelihood) Maybe tonight or tomorrow.  If you can see some Matlab code I written if you want to take a quick look.
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: another one, could you try
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: works?
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: didn't try to edit anything, but now I see the normal menus -- so yeah, it must work now
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: better double check :)

@HeikoS	so this is just for voting
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: But I guess its still fine
 iglesiasg	no idea what event-brite is, but ok
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: approved! Could you put this into the google doc and let thoralf know?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: its a platform for registering events in an oragnised way
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: sends out reminders etc
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: gives directions ...
@HeikoS	and people click through the offers

@HeikoS	yorkerlin: I see
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: this dual method, is it already working for you locally?
 yorkerlin	yes. But I have to test it and clean-up the code.  I can send you the Matlab code first.
 yorkerlin	The Matalb code is tested
 yorkerlin	The Matlab is based on Poisson distrbution, which has the close form of varational expection.
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: just wondering how this scales up in practice, how many points can you run this with locally?
 yorkerlin	Basically, it like the FullDiagonal method. It means O(n^3) but seems have fast convergence rate
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 yorkerlin	In Latent Gaussian model, n is the dim of the latent space. In GP, n is the number of sample point
 yorkerlin	Cholesky KL method has O(n^2) at each L-BFGS update. ApproxDiagonal has O(n) at each L-BFGS update.  Fast Dual KL method seems has fast convergence rate of L-BFGS compared to FullDiagonal KL method.
 yorkerlin	I only test on small dataset. I will test on some real dataset which has more then 1000 points
 yorkerlin	Do you have any suggestion?

@HeikoS	yorkerlin: yes, I would like to see what happens when you use 10000 pooints
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: but go ahead with your sutff for now
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: we should in fact stress test all your code in such larger regimes and put the scripts into benchmark
 yorkerlin	OK. I will test them locally first once I finish my sutff.

@HeikoS	iglesiasg: nice
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: what about - "Give your data a treat - Vol. 2"
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: let me know if you want to see anything change
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: sure
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: if you don't want to edit just let me know anything - doesn't matter how tiny the detail is ;-)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: TODO link should be replaced with your vote system.
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: sure
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: maybe even remove the list of topics in there, just put the lunk
@HeikoS	link
 iglesiasg	it makes sense
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: all fine apart from that. thanks!
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: but I understand that in the form I created I should just keep the topic votation
@HeikoS	ok, now thoralf can set up the events on event brite
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: shall I remove everyting else then?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: let me check
 lisitsyn	hey
 iglesiasg	btw, for the brite -- we should ask people about veg food
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: sup man

 lisitsyn	I sent a few mails back then
 lisitsyn	to all the participants
 lisitsyn	can do the same this time
 lisitsyn	just before the workshop
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: lets just order/provide a few veg things
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: do you have the vote link again?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: IIRC we had veg issue
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: main page of workshop should contain the text call for participation in the google doc, and the link to the vote site
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok, we can do thi
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: docs.google.com/forms/d/1GHve9BAxnJDe4LvRdplt-Bs9ARWCB90uZqPFHojSliE/viewform
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I think its fine. What about: "Vegetarian food?"
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: but the thing is -- are we going to use this form or this event brite thing for all these questions?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: goo dquestion
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thoralf brought this up for the hands on
 iglesiasg	last I understood was the current form should only contain topics
 iglesiasg	hehehe
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: maybe we should only have this for the hands-on and do the main registration over this form
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: otherwise three things to fiull in
 iglesiasg	well, since it is thoralf who would set up this event brite, let's wait for his opinion
 iglesiasg	yeah, I agree. Already more than one thing to fill in is too much
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thoralf wanted to have this eventbrite to get a list of people, but we would get this anyways
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: and to advertise
 iglesiasg	with this we get list of people in an spreadsheet in drive. Pretty handy if you ask me
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ok, what about having a checkbox for each "plan to attend workshop main day" and "plan to attend hands-on session ?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg:  I agree, maybe lets ditch event-brite
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah then add three things: main day (28 c-base), hands-on (27, researchgate)
@HeikoS	and veg
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thoralf can add the eventbrite thing to get more prople involved, but we dont need to advertise I gues
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: lets wait for his opinon. could you write an email and ask=?
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: in fact, lets just announce using this, we can put the eventbrite thing afterwards
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: let me know once things are done, then I will send out some mails

@besser82	HeikoS, Is the reg. form already working?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you put the call for contributions stuff at the main workshop site?
@HeikoS	besser82: not yet
@HeikoS	besser82: when I send an email then it is
@besser82	HeikoS, allrighty ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: planning to come?
@besser82	HeikoS, sure  :D
@HeikoS	nice! :D
@besser82	HeikoS, wanna all you folks in person ^^
@besser82	      ^^meet
@besser82	HeikoS, is there a schedule,yet?  like begins - ends?
@HeikoS	besser82: coming
@HeikoS	10-18
@HeikoS	11-19
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	10-18 if you wanna help
@HeikoS	in fact, then its 9-22 :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: gotta go now, will do the remainders tomorrow, thanks so much for your help
 iglesiasg	besser82: preliminar stuff - http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2014_program
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: no problem, we are in this together
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: thanks to you for pushing us. You are doing the real hard job
@besser82	HeikoS, will need some hotel then, I guess  ;)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: one more push: Let's aim to have this done by tomorrow! :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cool!
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah, I just booked mine a few days ago airbnb
@besser82	HeikoS, thx ^^  Will try my luck  ;)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you maybe answer in the workshop thread once you are done to keep everyone posted. also on the not using eventbrite thing?
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: let's wait a couple of hours for thoralf though since the eventbrite was his thing
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: putting the link to the form in the website and making it live so people can start voting should take no time (like one minute)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah thats why I suggested the email. Maybe we can have it optionally for the hands-on
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: but I will do it before tomorrow morning since I cannot do it once I get to job
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yeah, but I want to send out everything together, so lets see what he says
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ok fine
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cu!

 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: so you maybe know about this C++ x-file
 lisitsyn	what x-file?
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2316
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: let me sum it up
 iglesiasg	basically there was a constructor with a default value
 iglesiasg	CHuberLoss(float64_t m_delta=default_value)
 lisitsyn	alright
 iglesiasg	that constructor calls default constructor on base class
 lisitsyn	CLossFunction
 iglesiasg	calls init that initialises the attirbute and SG_ADD
 iglesiasg	when SG_ADD is left, then serialization tests fail
 iglesiasg	when it is removed, they work
 iglesiasg	problem is solved by adding the default constructor that calls init, in addition to default constructor of base class
 iglesiasg	so it must be definitely be that the default constructor that is implicitly created was called
 iglesiasg	instead of using CHuberLoss(float64_t) with its default value
 lisitsyn	NEYMAR
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sorry ok
 lisitsyn	this is confusing
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: that's quite interesting
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: can we test whether default constructor is called?
 lisitsyn	I mean with breakpoint or debug print in the non-default constructor
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: it is already fixed, but we could do it locally I guess
 iglesiasg	but it is confusing yes
 iglesiasg	I am reading
 lisitsyn	totally
 iglesiasg	In the case of the default constructor, the compiler will not generate a default constructor if a class is defined with any constructors.
 iglesiasg	from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7469468/defaulted-default-constructor-in-n3290-draft
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	it shouldn't generate
 iglesiasg	it seems though that C++11 uses other rules
