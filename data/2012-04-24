 blackburn	pluskid: hey there
 pluskid	blackburn: hi :D
 blackburn	congrats being accepted
 pluskid	blackburn: thank you!
 pluskid	blackburn: congrats to you, too (though not that necessary, haha)
 blackburn	I guess you understand why I suggested some multiclass improvements before ;)
 pluskid	blackburn: ah, I see now :)
 blackburn	I am sorry it is not what you wanted from the beginning but I hope it would be fun
 pluskid	never mind, I'm very interested in this topic, too
 blackburn	I need to admit we planned me as kind of co-mentor for your task
 pluskid	wow, that's great
 blackburn	as I am particularly interested in multiclass things
 pluskid	you are more available than Cheng I guess, haha
 blackburn	cheng soon is the expert so he can suggest something cool still
 blackburn	so I can help you with some development
 pluskid	yeah, but I guess he would also be super busy
 pluskid	you would be super busy, too (as both a student and a mentor, haha)
 blackburn	actually you both are in similar timezones so it makes your contact easier
 pluskid	yes
 blackburn	you do not need much support so I won't be very busy helping you
 pluskid	Ah, I thought Cheng is in MPI
 blackburn	no, melbourne
 pluskid	ah, then would be in similar time zone
 pluskid	not sure whether he knows Chinese, haha :p
 blackburn	he is malaysian afaik
 blackburn	no idea actually
 pluskid	hmm
 blackburn	what you can do right now is to write him a mail I think
 pluskid	already done :)
 blackburn	ah right
 pluskid	though I haven't written the self-intro email to shogun, et
 blackburn	next mails discussing project should be better CCed with shogun mailing list
 pluskid	sure~
 blackburn	I am writing this introductive mail rigght now
 pluskid	I'll do that soon, too
 pluskid	btw: when will the kick off meeting?
 blackburn	pluskid: end of this week probably or so
 pluskid	ok

 pluskid	sonne|work: hmm, just got his name in Chinese: ??? :p
 blackburn	sonne|work: I know you think DA is useless but I am going to implement some really fun application
 blackburn	sonne|work: were you at/have you checked NIPS 2011 DA workshop?
 sonne|work	pluskid: whatever that means :D
 sonne|work	pluskid: btw, since you are the only one who has a homepage I had a look
 sonne|work	seems like you are an artist too!
 sonne|work	nice pictures
 sonne|work	I love the nausica anime btw
 pluskid	sonne|work: not enough to be an artist, but I like drawing :D

 sonne|work	pluskid:  you have actually the skills to  draw some nice shogun logo - if something comes to your mind don't hesitsate :)
 sonne|work	hesitate
 sonne|work	blackburn: no
 sonne|work	there where interesting ones too :P
 pluskid	sonne|work: aha, I'll try, if I got any good idea :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: there was a paper about domain adaptation from virtual video game pedestrian detection to real world
 ted__	sonne|work: I know you are pretty busy. I am looking for c++ example for string kernel (with features of diff size) and possible multiclass svm in these case. If you have time to share smthg it would be great. tx.
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'm going to do the trick with traffic signs
 sonne|work	ted__: look at the examples

-!- ted__ [2e1fd566@gateway/web/freenode/ip.46.31.213.102] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 blackburn	wiking: no idea what is the appropriate answer :)
 wiking	blackburn: sehr gut, danke ;)
 blackburn	heh sounds reasonable
 wiking	or ganz schlecht ;)
 wiking	depends on your mood ;P
 wiking	but ask sonney2k ... i guess he is a fluent german speaker :)
 blackburn	wiking: if I start asking sonney2k about german he would buy a ticket to samara, find me and do something to stop that
 wiking	hahahahahah
 wiking	personally i hate german language, even if when my knowledge is about intermediate ;P
 blackburn	why? I feel excited about it
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	i think the most i don't like about it is the der, die, das
 wiking	and after that the sound of it :)
 wiking	and the learning curve of the language is different as well... it takes a much longer time than for example in english to get on a good communication level
 wiking	so rather go and study french or something :)
 wiking	or mandarine ;)
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has joined #shogun
 wiking	ok time to write a short email about me
 blackburn	wiking: der die das is not confusing while we have these word genders in russian :)
 wiking	blackburn: but it makes no fucking sense :)
 wiking	i mean in german
 wiking	:)))0
 wiking	in slavic language i still get it
 wiking	b
 wiking	u
 wiking	t
 sonne|work	wiking: why don't you want a horse to not be male :)
 blackburn	ah really I forgot you know srbska
 sonne|work	and a duck female :D
 wiking	but when in german the bra is der,
 wiking	sonne|work: male bra!
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 wiking	der BH
 wiking	i think that is the worse
 wiking	:)
 sonne|work	wiking: makes even more sense :D
 blackburn	wiking: you steal my motivation! how can I talk to sonne|work then
 blackburn	;)
 wiking	but i guess it's because der halter
 wiking	so they just had to stick to it :P
 n4nd0	wiking: hey! do you have a moment to discuss about SO?
-!- emrecelikten [~emre@176.40.232.233] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: it is like the owner :D
 sonne|work	*lol*
 sonne|work	I never expected a discussion like this
 pluskid	wiking: welcome to Mandarin :D
 sonne|work	pluskid: I question that any of us knows >2 chinese characters
 sonne|work	pluskid: except you of course!
 sonne|work	so we cannot even write about the things we don't know!
 pluskid	sonne|work: you mean you know nothing beyond ?? (shogun) ? :p
 sonne|work	exactly
* blackburn would never be able to write it down
 sonne|work	well 1,2,3 (these horizontal strokes) too but that doesn't really count
 pluskid	haha!
 blackburn	I thought it is japanese actually lol :D
 pluskid	blackburn: Japanese and Chinese shares a lot of characters
 blackburn	really? how much it coincides?
 pluskid	sonne|work: you will learn a new character, for ten, we use a cross (more like a plus sign, "+")
 pluskid	blackburn: a lot, but many are slightly different, the history said the Japanese borrow ancient Chinese characters long long ago
 blackburn	I see
 pluskid	but the syntax are rather different, they only borrow characters, not syntax
 blackburn	is there a syntax? :D
 pluskid	for what?
 blackburn	I really do not get how it is like to write in these two languages
 blackburn	it seems to be very different right?
 pluskid	I don't understand you
 pluskid	you mean the sentence would be different?
 pluskid	or the characters (strokes)?
 blackburn	pluskid: sentences
 blackburn	does it make sense to translate word by word?
 pluskid	blackburn: then would be quite different
 pluskid	blackburn: the order of Japanese is a bit strange
 pluskid	they use "subject object verb" order
 blackburn	pluskid: how would you say that you just said in chinese *but* translated to english word-by-word?
 pluskid	actually, except they require verb should be put at the end, the order for other elements can be interchanged freely
 pluskid	blackburn: you want me to say a sentence in chinese and translate to english word-by-word?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	pluskid: I mean it seems that all the things are pretty different
 pluskid	??????????
 blackburn	how would you indicate some say past perfect in chinese?
 pluskid	Japanese's order is a bit strange
 pluskid	the time can be inferred from the context
 pluskid	and there are some decorating words
 pluskid	to indicate the time of the action
 blackburn	pluskid: so actually is it feasible to parse something translated from chinese to english with such brute force?
 pluskid	like the word "will" in english
 pluskid	it means the action will be in future
 pluskid	blackburn: quite difficult I would say
 pluskid	look at google translate :)
 blackburn	yeah that was clear google translate would fuck up with it
 blackburn	but is it feasible for native?
 pluskid	hmm, word-by-word translation... maybe feasible, the result will read strange, but I guess people can understand
 blackburn	what I mean is not only language as words and chars but language as way of mind is pretty different
 blackburn	and you may think about some things I can not because I can't describe it with my words
 blackburn	:D
 pluskid	hmm, maybe
 emrecelikten	blackburn: Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
 blackburn	emrecelikten: LOL I knew you would say something like that
 emrecelikten	Why? :D
 blackburn	emrecelikten: you tend to discuss some psychology contexts :)
 emrecelikten	blackburn: Nice observation
 blackburn	emrecelikten: but what do you personally think about this hypothesis?
 blackburn	I am pretty sure it works for languages
 blackburn	but programming ones
 emrecelikten	blackburn: Well I am no expert aks ko polyglot, but it ssems to be true to some extent
 emrecelikten	ah sorry, and no polyglot*
 emrecelikten	still trying to get used to colemak
 blackburn	pluskid: have you checked that ECOC JMLR paper?
 pluskid	blackburn: no, which one?
 pluskid	I'm reading another paper
 blackburn	pluskid: which one?
 pluskid	by gun :p
 pluskid	Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies
 blackburn	pluskid: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/escalera10a/escalera10a.pdf
 blackburn	pluskid: http://mloss.org/software/view/238/
* n4nd0 is afk
 pluskid	blackburn: thanks! great references
 blackburn	pluskid: remarkable thing there is that OvR, OvO and even trees are ECOCs
 pluskid	interesting
 blackburn	pluskid: I think it would be easy for you to port these routines from the ECOC library
 pluskid	blackburn: I will look at their code tomorrow
 pluskid	just need a good-designed framework in shogun for this I guess :)
 blackburn	pluskid: that could be your first step
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	but you already did one
 blackburn	you would have to extend strategies I think and nothing moer
 pluskid	but improvements are needed I think :)
 pluskid	yes, strategies
 n4nd0	pluskid: the authors of ECOC are Spanish btw, tell me if you find some non-translated doc :P
 pluskid	n4nd0: haha! OK, thanks!
 blackburn	sonne|work: openmrs has got 18 (!!!) students
 sonne|work	I think you need some full time admin for that many students
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes 6-7 admins at least
 blackburn	sonne|work: they are totally funded from a lot of sources - in the end they do pretty useful software
 wiking	n4nd0: heeey
 wiking	n4nd0: sorry i had a meeting
