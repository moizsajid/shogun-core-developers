@sonney2k	in datatype.h
@sonney2k	I think we have to cancel the meeting today
@sonney2k	and do it on Monday next week
@sonney2k	blackburn, VojtechFranc, alesis-novik, mlsec, heiko would that fit better?
 VojtechFranc	sonney2k, for me both options are OK
@sonney2k	I've had 50% complaining about the appointment today
@sonney2k	nips deadline etc
@sonney2k	VojtechFranc, how is it going with alesis-novik? Did you already do things?
 heiko	sonney2k, ok, next monday is ok for me
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.4.255] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
 VojtechFranc	sonney2k, we are just starting the real programming. Alesis finished exams the last week.

@sonney2k	(I am asking here before sending another stupid meeting schedule email causing yet more chaos)
@sonney2k	VojtechFranc, so nothing yet - I guess?
@sonney2k	but you have a plan I suppose :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, monday also good for you?
 heiko	sonney2k, when will the meeting be next monay? I do not have time between 1330 and 1530 (german time)
 VojtechFranc	sonney2k, yes, we are following a plan, don't worry :)
 heiko	thats 1130 to 1330 utc i think
@sonney2k	heiko 13 UTC so 15:00 german time
@sonney2k	we could schedule it to 13:30 UTC
 heiko	ok, then I will be half an hour late
 heiko	ok
 heiko	this would be ok
 heiko	what about using a doodle?
 heiko	do you know this? is quite handy for getting meetings organized on the internet
@sonney2k	heiko, yes I know but I am not really flexible
 VojtechFranc	sonney2k, actually I already forced myself to program the algorithm in Matlab and Alesis is now traying to do it in Shogunm
@sonney2k	heiko, I need to have childcare in that period...
@sonney2k	read grandparents
@sonney2k	VojtechFranc, very good
@sonney2k	btw congrats on you ICML paper!
 heiko	sonney2k, ok :)
@sonney2k	things will be better in july though
 heiko	well, enjoy your family life. Currently I know what to do, so its ok
@sonney2k	heiko in case you have things to discuss - ask. btw great job with the parameter setting generator!
 heiko	I will ask - thanks :)
@bettyboo	heiko, yeah
@sonney2k	heiko, I hope you can now rely on the CMachine infrastructure
 heiko	was quite a lot of fiddeling with new and delete :)
@sonney2k	and perf measures etc
 heiko	I will check it out
@sonney2k	I mean now you can do the real thing just assuming that you do modsel for a machine
 heiko	Currently I am building a method that sets the ParameterCombination trees to a acutal machine
 heiko	yes
 heiko	then I will build one simple splitting strategy and a simple grid search
@sonney2k	good plan
 heiko	then when everything works fine, I will finish the subset stuff etc
 heiko	and then examples
 heiko	Just to remind you: I will leave for some climbing over the long weekend till sunday this evening
@sonney2k	heiko, I remember - we still have 3 months. Given your progress it should be feasible if we don't stumble upon tons of stepping stones
 heiko	hope so :)
 heiko	do you still have a minute?
@sonney2k	shoot
 heiko	just encountered a thing ...
 heiko	for the C parameter there is C1 and C2
 heiko	for libsvm
 heiko	and also CSVM
 heiko	but you only hand ONE C-value in the constructor, both C1, B2 are then set to this value
 heiko	however, when I want to set a C parameter, it is not know, because there are only C1 and C2
 heiko	but when you want to specify the C parameter for model selection you only want to set ONE C parameter
@sonney2k	there are two C's one for positive and one for negative class
 alesis-novik	Morning
 VojtechFranc	alesis-novik, hi
 heiko	yes, but they are not used in the libsvm case when the svm is constructed by the constructor
 heiko	and when I want only ONE c parameter to be modseled, I cant just use C but I have to use C1 or C2
 alesis-novik	So, I've started working on the algorithm. I've decided to start be rewriting the Gaussian class to work with decomposed matrices and in log domain
 heiko	Also, for example CLibSvm does only use one:
 heiko	param.C = get_C1(); //is the only call
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, ok - just don't forget to write a weekly *short* email to the mailinglist keeping everyone updated
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, will do.
 VojtechFranc	alesis-novik, great. How can I see the code?
 alesis-novik	I'll commit it to my branch when I get it to the state where it compiles
 VojtechFranc	ok
 alesis-novik	When I do, it will be in https://github.com/alesis/shogun/tree/gmm
 VojtechFranc	ok, them please let me know when I can start testing
 alesis-novik	Not to break the class to much, I want to keep the get/set covariance as well (maybe something else will find the class useful)
@sonney2k	heiko, checking
@sonney2k	heiko, it uses C1 and C2
@sonney2k	    float64_t weights[2]={1.0,get_C2()/get_C1()};
 heiko	yes
 heiko	something like to set multiple parameters with one value is needed here
@sonney2k	I think I/we have to modify code to make this work.
@sonney2k	e.g. C2 will alsways be 0.0 by default
@sonney2k	and if it is only C1 is used
 alesis-novik	VojtechFranc, so all in all, I'm planing to keep the structure as it is now, but rewrite the methods.
 heiko	ok, I see
 heiko	and then just change C1 in modsel if one wants the standard C
@sonney2k	heiko, only alternative is to be able to set combinations of parameters
 heiko	do you think this problem will appear at another place?
 heiko	i would prefer the first way if this only happens here because it would be quite technical to implement the second one
 VojtechFranc	alesis-novik, I'm not familiar with the current GMM class. I need to look at it.
 alesis-novik	Essentially I use the Gaussian class within the GMM class to represent the mixture components
@sonney2k	heiko, I don't like the C1/C2 thing either - I just don't know how to do it better
@sonney2k	and I don't hope this happens more often
@sonney2k	er do hope
 heiko	mmh
 VojtechFranc	alesis-novik, in which files is the definition of the current GMM ?
 alesis-novik	clustering/GMM.h
 alesis-novik	and I guess distributions/Gaussian.h
@sonney2k	heiko, I mean we have cases where the SVM has just one C or one can set a vector of C's (example based)
 heiko	mmmh perhaps it is best to implement this multiple parameters-one value thing
@sonney2k	heiko, or not and assume that we set a vector of Cs or just one C
 heiko	I dont understand this really, could you explain it again?
@sonney2k	heiko, can't you set a vector of values?
 heiko	where? for the modsel parameters?
@sonney2k	heiko, yes I mean currently a double or SGObject
@sonney2k	but a vector of doubles then
 heiko	yes it is possible
 heiko	however, currently the modelSelectionParams only set single values or SGObject
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah today is fine too :)
 VojtechFranc	alesis-novik, do you need at this point some help from my side?
 alesis-novik	VojtechFranc, did you look at the definitions? If the current structure seems fine, then I don't really have any more questions
 alesis-novik	I've rewritten the definition of Gaussian to have D and U instead of cov_matrix and added a "type" field
 alesis-novik	So now I'm rewriting the implementation of pdf methods
 alesis-novik	I'm still thinking of keeping the "constant" part in, computing it when new covariances are set
 VojtechFranc	regarding the definitions of GMM class, maybe it would be better if the constructor of the class was not liked to the EM algorihtm.
 VojtechFranc	GMM paramaters can be estimated by other methods
 VojtechFranc	it is also reasonable to add the parmaaters of GMM manually
 VojtechFranc	isnt it better to have a method train_em(max_iter,min_change) ?
 VojtechFranc	I mean the GMM class should be mainly a data structure to represent a mixture of Gaussians. The EM algorithm is just a single way how to set up its parameters.
 alesis-novik	Ok, so the constructor should just have the number of components (or initial number of components) and then a train_em method of actual EM
 VojtechFranc	yes, I think it is better
 VojtechFranc	maybe, there should be another method (or constructor) to setup the inital vaule of the GMM paramaters
 alesis-novik	Should that be in form of GMM(n, means, covs) or GMM(n, gaussians)?
 VojtechFranc	to me both options are OK
 VojtechFranc	however, the constructor should have also another argument : cov_type
 alesis-novik	ah, if it's GMM(n, gaussians) I guess that wouldn't be needed, because cov_type would be in the gaussians already
 VojtechFranc	I think the typicall usage will be GMM(n_componets,cov_type) then running the EM which sets the paramaters from training set
 alesis-novik	I'll start from that then, adding additional features later
 VojtechFranc	yes, I think it is good to start from simpler and then improve
 alesis-novik	Ah, I remembered another question: in gmm_em.m you use knnest to initially assign datapoints. Does that make a significant improvement over just iterating EM?
 VojtechFranc	knnest is used to get initial parameters;  do you have a better way how to do it?
 VojtechFranc	you can either randomly initiallize the paramaters (Mean,Cov,Priors) or to randomly initialize p(y|x) assignments of data to clussters
 VojtechFranc	knnest returns the crisp assignment of examples to clusters.
 alesis-novik	The current one does a static initialization of covariances and KMeans for means
 VojtechFranc	the m-code I send you 1) finds n centers either randonmly or by k-mean, 2) it assigns the points to this centers and 3) estimates means and covs for each cluster
 alesis-novik	I guess I could try using KNN for parameter initialization, but I'm not sure if the current implementation in Shogun can do that.
 VojtechFranc	I see, so the queation is if shogun has implemnetaion of KNN? well I don't know. we should aske Soeren
 alesis-novik	Shogun has the implementation of KNN, but I don't think I can define centers manually and it has to be trained. Essentially is a proper KNN I guess.
 alesis-novik	wouldn't the effect be similar to initializing the covariance to a spherical one? (not by type, but covariance itself)
 VojtechFranc	it seems to be better if the initial estimate of covs fits the data, i.e. setting them to identity matrices is not generally a good idea
 blackburn	I have some 'experience' with shogun's KNN and could adapt it if it is needed
 VojtechFranc	I think it is not a big problem to do assigment of N points to K clusters...
 VojtechFranc	i.e. we need only the 1-NN
 blackburn	just fyi :)
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.4.255] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 alesis-novik	ok, I'll see what can be done. I can just implement 1-NN assignment in the method itself if needed
 alesis-novik	Since I won't really need to think about distances
 VojtechFranc	iii[
 VojtechFranc	yes, exactly
 VojtechFranc	so, alesis I have to leave now.
 alesis-novik	Ok, I don't think I have any more questions now.
 alesis-novik	If I think of any, I'll e-mail you
 VojtechFranc	OK, great. And please, don't forget to write SHORT progress report as Soeren pointed out
 VojtechFranc	bye
 alesis-novik	See you
