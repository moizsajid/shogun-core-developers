 thoralf	abinash_panda: I'm fine.
 thoralf	Really hot here... over 30?C.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Same here
 thoralf	abinash_panda: You said CLibSVMFile cannot handle files with 1000 dimension feature vectors, right?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Is it possible to create a minimal example?
 thoralf	e.g. only 1 line with many features or sth. like that?
 abinash_panda	Yeah. I had tried on my machine.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Meaning a LibSVMFile with a single example??
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@nat-160-92.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yes, something we can use for debugging the problem.
 abinash_panda	Ok. I would write an minimal example.
 thoralf	(Or something I can try locally.)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: BTW, I had sent you a mail regarding the tests. In that I have mentioned regarding code for creating a minimal example.
 thoralf	Best do a example-libsvm-file and a small script and create a gist.
 thoralf	Yeah, let me check if this is enough.

 thoralf	abinash_panda: Is it a private GIST?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Let me check.
 thoralf	Going to your profile and manually clicking works.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I have checked. Its not a private gist.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Can you provide a simple failing input file as well?
 abinash_panda	Okay. Sending you right now.
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@nat-160-92.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Client Quit]
 thoralf	abinash_panda: The file has 33 MB - this is not really minimal.  My mailclient still tries opening. ;)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Can you try if the error still occurs if you only provide one line?  Try: "head -n 1 sample.svm >only-one-line-sample.svm"
 thoralf	abinash_panda: You're printing 250:0.000000 and 597:1.000000 in your generator.  You can omit the zero-lines (SVMlight format is sparse!) and print "597:1" for active features.  (Just minor optimization, which should happen after tracking down the bug. ;))
 abinash_panda	thoralf: When I try to work on a file with only 1 sample, it works fine. But, as I increase the number of samples, it slows down with increase in the number of features. Infact when I had tried with 100000 examples and 100 features, it worked.
 abinash_panda	But as I increased the feature to 1000, with 2000 samples only it stopped working.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Regarding the minor optimization as you specified, I would try it ;)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I'm interested a which file size the error occurs... can you say if it works with files of slightly less than 10MB and stops working with files slightly over 10MB?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1991
 thoralf	I knew this problem wasn't new.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: LineReader.cpp has a constant m_max_token_length=10*1024*1024; which is related to your problem.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Try increasing it to 128 MB as a workaround.
