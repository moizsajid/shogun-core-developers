 wiking	blackburn: yes
 wiking	ubuntu's package doesn't ship with gmock-config :(
 wiking	so we need to do soemthing else in ./configure script to detect and add compile flags for gmock on ubuntu
 blackburn	what is the solution? install by hand?
 wiking	heiko solved it by installing gmock by hand
 wiking	but as i said in the mailing list
 wiking	that's not a really good solution ;)
 blackburn	I think it is rather ok - we (developers) can install it and only we do need it

 blackburn1	uricamic: hey
 blackburn1	uricamic: can I merge your PR now?
 uricamic	blackburn1: hi, I hope so
 blackburn1	uricamic: I mean did you work out things Soeren pointed?
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn1	okay I see
 uricamic	everything should be fixed according to comments
 CIA-39	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r8c987fd / (18 files in 4 dirs): Merge pull request #699 from uricamic/BM_SOL_EXAMPLE (+8 more commits...) - http://git.io/_XWA-g
 blackburn1	uricamic: btw I had a question
 wiking	blackburn1: mergmeme :D
 uricamic	blackburn1: go on :)
 blackburn1	wiking: yeah will glance it over once again in 5 mins
 blackburn1	uricamic: in risk function there is float64_t* R
 blackburn1	is it just a pointer to one float - risk value?
 uricamic	wiking: there is one important change in risk function you should be aware of
 uricamic	blackburn1: yep
 blackburn1	uricamic: actually may be we could change it not to void but float64_t return type
 blackburn1	to reduce num of parameters
 uricamic	you mean to directly return the value of risk from that function?
 blackburn1	yeah
 uricamic	yep, that sounds reasonable
 blackburn1	uricamic: that would make director risk function easier to use
 wiking	uricamic: ah cool then i'll wait for the merge
 wiking	i mean your merge... so i change mine as well
 blackburn1	now one have to do R[0] = ...
 uricamic	blackburn1: ok, so I will change it now
 blackburn1	heh I merged too fast
 uricamic	ok, next PR :)
 blackburn1	uricamic: btw how fast it is for MNIST?
 shogun-buildbot	build #319 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/319  blamelist: Michal Uricar <uricar.michal@gmail.com>
 shogun-buildbot	build #320 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/320
 uricamic	well, to be honest, the risk function could be written in much better way (some precomputations), but now it is like 1s per iteration on whole MNIST database (i.e. 60k examples, feature vector dimensionality 784)
 shogun-buildbot	build #329 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/329  blamelist: Michal Uricar <uricar.michal@gmail.com>
 blackburn1	uricamic: how many iterations does it require to converge to some consistent solution?
 uricamic	comparing with exactly same implementation in MATLAB it is like 8x faster
 uricamic	depends on regularization constant lambda, but I think several hundreds
 blackburn1	uricamic: hmm it sounds like it is not really slower than linear crammer-singer
 blackburn1	interesting
 blackburn1	I mean liblinear and libocas implementations (they take similar time on 40K examples/ 1K features dataset)
 uricamic	blackburn1: but I think it can be made faster with better risk function, doing some clever precomputations
 blackburn1	I see
 shogun-buildbot	build #222 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/222  blamelist: Michal Uricar <uricar.michal@gmail.com>
 blackburn1	wiking: so shall I wait you to rebase against uricamic changes?

 wiking	blackburn1: let me try to rebase
 wiking	mm rebase went fine i'll try to compule
 wiking	*compile if that works then u can just merge it straight away
 wiking	hehe yeah no i need to fix some shit
 blackburn1	~150 warnings left
 blackburn1	I will kill them all soon
 shogun-buildbot	build #330 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/330  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, Michal Uricar <uricar.michal@gmail.com>
 wiking	blackburn1: what should be done about the libocas update?
 blackburn1	wiking: I didn't check yet
 wiking	blackburn1: there was this thing with the multiclass svm solver of libocas... the -1 or no -1
 wiking	i guess we shouldn't do -1 as in previous cases there was no -1 ;)
 wiking	previous cases = previous version of libocas
* wiking still compiling... stupid modular interface ;)
 wiking	ohshitfuck
 wiking	i hate this
 uricamic	Is it possible to get PyCharm license for shogun?
 blackburn1	I had a crack somewhere
 blackburn1	:D
 wiking	ok i'll redo this pull request
 uricamic	:) but it could be possible to obtain free license for shogun developers :)
 wiking	otherwise it'll be just a mess
 uricamic	which I guess is cleaner solution
 blackburn1	wiking: redo??
 blackburn1	uricamic: yeah just apply on their site as shogun developer
 wiking	blackburn1: do a new PR
 wiking	blackburn1: that'll be nicer
 blackburn1	okay
 uricamic	blackburn1: ok, and should I apply it just for me, I mean who should be the contact person?
 blackburn1	uricamic: I think it should be you
 uricamic	ok, thx
 blackburn1	Please make sure that you meet the following criteria:
 blackburn1	You are the project lead or a committer
 blackburn1	You have been working on your open source project for a minimum of 3 months
 blackburn1	Your community is active. This means that you have recent activity in your newsgroups or forums
 blackburn1	You have an updated News section on your site
 blackburn1	You release updated builds on a regular basis
 blackburn1	uricamic: ^
 wiking	blackburn1: this should work https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/709
 uricamic	blackburn1: I know, I just didn't know if it should be like the leader of the project asks for license for all developers
 blackburn1	uricamic: first point is not satisfied probably but just try
 blackburn1	uricamic: I don't get that too
 uricamic	ok, I will just try
 blackburn1	if they deny lets just ask soeren
 blackburn1	:D
 uricamic	blackburn1: sure :)
 blackburn1	however I am a commiter so I could try too
 wiking	ok this compiled again
 wiking	so all's good with that PR
 uricamic	blackburn1: ok, I have sent it, in few days there should be some response
 blackburn1	uricamic: I've used pycharm for a while but didn't really like it - do you like it?
 uricamic	blackburn1: I don't know, I am a python newbie :D but so far it seems nice
 blackburn1	uricamic: I see
 uricamic	and one my college, who is a big fan of python likes it a lot
 blackburn1	uricamic: what do you use to develop with C++?
 uricamic	now I am using QtCreator
 uricamic	since it seems to cooperate with CMake nicely
 blackburn1	I see
 wiking	blackburn1: :)

 wiking	blackburn1: just writing the unittest
 wiking	and we'll see
 blackburn1	this probably maps 0 to -1
 wiking	lol shogun-unit-test(85744,0x7fff7c412180) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fb913c071b8: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.

 wiking	blackburn1: mmmm in multiclass labelling the labels should be: 0,1,2 etc?
 blackburn1	yes
 wiking	how fast multiclassocas is actually?
 wiking	suppose to be fast for a 3 class problem
 wiking	?
 wiking	3 guassians, each having 25 examples and the vector dim is 2
 wiking	mmm this doesn't work :)
 wiking	anybody ever tested multiclassOCAS?
 wiking	i see a python exmaple of it :)
 blackburn1	wiking: yes it works
 blackburn1	wiking: slower than liblinear but for your case should converge in a few milliseconds I believe
 wiking	mmm i wonder what i do wrong
 wiking	as it really doesn't find anything
 wiking	i mean everything is mapped to 0.0
 wiking	most probably my bad...

 shogun-buildbot	build #324 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/324
 wiking	i've missed the --amend
 wiking	blackburn1: i've tried now with only 2 labels (0/1) using multiclass ocas, basically the same data set that works for svmocas
 wiking	and it fails
 wiking	:S
 blackburn1	wiking: fails like?
 wiking	all example is classified to 0
 wiking	so i have 2 gaussians
 wiking	i mean samples of 2 different gaussians
 blackburn1	how many iterations?
 wiking	one is labeled as 0 the other as 1
 wiking	blackburn1: haven't debugged it, just a sec i'll print it

 wiking	 CMulticlassOCAS* mocas = new CMulticlassOCAS(C, train_feats, ground_truth);
 wiking	  mocas->io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG);
 wiking	mmm doesn't really work :(
 blackburn1	it outputs information just after training
 blackburn1	with debug level
 wiking	yes i know
 wiking	but if i do this
 wiking	and then call mocas->train()
 wiking	it doesn't print out anything :S
 blackburn1	then something is broken in your example :D
 wiking	?!
 blackburn1	I do not undrestand how can it skip debug print
 wiking	?![DEBUG] Number of iterations [nIter] = 5
 wiking	heheh ok i've fixed it
 wiking	shogun wasn't init-ed in a right way
 wiking	[DEBUG] Number of training errors [trn_err] = 25
 wiking	:S
 wiking	that is funny
 wiking	:))
 wiking	out of 50 samples :)))
 wiking	where 25 is 0 and 25 is 1
 wiking	:)
 blackburn1	what is epsilon?
 wiking	default
 wiking	lemme check what is it
 blackburn1	no, not really relevant
 blackburn1	I mean if it was 1e-1 I would believe heh
 wiking	1e-2
 blackburn1	okay then compare
 blackburn1	with liblinear
 blackburn1	I am totally sure liblinear works
 shogun-buildbot	build #333 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/333  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	optimization finished, #iter = 164
 wiking	same error with liblienar
 blackburn1	then something is wrong with your features and labels
 wiking	blackburn1: but it works with SVMOcas
 wiking	the same binary case
 wiking	:)
 wiking	perfectly
 blackburn1	so you set labels to
 blackburn1	0 and 1
 blackburn1	right?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	instead of -1 and 1
 wiking	everything is the same
 wiking	just the labels are 0 and 1 instead of -1 and 1
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/tests/unit/classifier/svm/SVMOcas_unittest.cc
 wiking	the only difference is
 wiking	line 29
 wiking	line 37
 wiking	and line 40
 wiking	and obviously 42
 wiking	everything else is the same
 wiking	even the random seed is the same
 wiking	thus the gaussians are the same
 blackburn1	that's strange
 wiking	yep
 wiking	especially that not only libocas fails
 wiking	but liblinear
 blackburn1	I just checked on my rsr stuff - liblinear converges to right solution
 wiking	so i really wonder
 blackburn1	did you change it to multiclasslabels?
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/5VQTYtZp
 wiking	this is the full test code
 wiking	and yeah
 wiking	i'm using CMulticlassLabels
 blackburn1	interesting
 blackburn1	wiking: I have one suspect - copy subset..
 wiking	blackburn1: but that works in case of SVMOcas :)
 blackburn1	yes because svmocas would work with subset
 wiking	any fast way to divide the whole set then in another way?
 blackburn1	I checked code and it should be ok
 blackburn1	if (i % 2 == 0)      train_idx[j] = i;    else      test_idx[j++] = i;
 blackburn1	is it correct?

 blackburn1	wiking: why do you set half of labels and increase j only on test indices?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	as u can see j increases every 2nd time in the iter
 wiking	as you want to divide the whole matrix
 wiking	into 2 different sets
 blackburn1	I don't know - that all sounds strange
 blackburn1	I wouldn't believe something is wrong both in liblinear and ocas
 wiking	heheh me neither
 wiking	i guess something is wrong on my end
 wiking	it's just weird that it works with svmocas

-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-176-126-57.range86-176.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
 wiking	heiko: is there a fast way to test whether the features in a matrix are from 2 diff gauss distrib?
 heiko	yes :)
 heiko	t-test
 heiko	if you are one-dimensional
 heiko	and if not: My statistics framework :)
 heiko	wiking, what kind of data do you got?
 wiking	heiko: the SGMatrix that is created by that function i wrote in DataGenerator
 heiko	Ill take a look
 wiking	heiko: for some reason i'm having trouble using that and trying to learn a multiclass classifier with the generated data :S
 heiko	oh :)
 wiking	so now i'm trying to find out what could be the trouble :S
 heiko	maybe plot it for dim=2?
 heiko	you could also fit a Gaussian with ML
 heiko	wiking
 heiko	what do you want to create in the method i dont get the comments
 wiking	heiko: create a matrix
 heiko	what kind of gaussians should the samples come from
 wiking	where there are m samples for each of the n gaussians
 heiko	you only say that there are multiple ones
 heiko	what are their parameters?
 wiking	heiko: random
 wiking	heiko: you mean for mu, right?
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	random?
 wiking	yes that is randomly generated
 heiko	so random mean
 heiko	and random variance
 wiking	variance is a diagonal
 heiko	and from each of these a fixed number of samples?
 wiking	eigenmatrix
 wiking	[1,0;0,1]
 heiko	do all of them have the same probability to generate a sample or are they weighted?
 wiking	if dim = 2
 heiko	so variance is not random
 wiking	yep that's not random
 heiko	I suggest the following: first create a method (or check whether it exists): gaussian_sample(SGVector mean, SGMatrix variance)
 heiko	and then just call that with random means
 wiking	heiko: well that's more or less what's happening ;0
 wiking	:)
 heiko	ah thats the Gaussian class right?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	Gaussian class generates the samples for the given gaussian
 wiking	ok maybe the problem is not linearly separable? :)
 heiko	btw you dont need to call this get_allocated_matrix stuff if you dont have a target matrix as parameter
 wiking	i mean the mean is just not good
 heiko	gaussians mixtures are per definition not linearly separable
 heiko	you might be lucky but not in general
 heiko	you  need a large distance  at least e*std-dev
 wiking	heiko i guess i got lucky in case of svmocas then
 heiko	3*stddev
 heiko	I looked at the method
 heiko	this mean.random()
 heiko	breaks it
 heiko	you need to ensure that the means are far enough apart from each other
 wiking	yep
 wiking	htat's what i thought now
 wiking	any ideas
 wiking	how can i generate good enough means if i know the dim and the number of gaussians i have
 wiking	since i guess all of them should be equally far apart from each other
 heiko	yeah, dont use random means
 heiko	the samples are random anyway
 blackburn1	one must be careful with 0.01 probability left with 3 sigmas
 blackburn1	:D
 heiko	or you could order them in a grid
 heiko	thanks blackburn :)
 blackburn1	heiko: do I remember that correctly? 0.995 is percentile or so?
 heiko	yeah :)
 heiko	wiking, just create hypercubes of gaussians
 heiko	Ill send you a picture
 wiking	heiko: great
 blackburn1	4d cube
 blackburn1	:D
 wiking	heiko: so depending on the dim
 wiking	i take the 'corners' of the hypercube?
 wiking	i.e. if dim = 2
 blackburn1	just generate all combinations of vector of size dim consisting +-d
 wiking	0,0; 0,1; 1,0; 11
 wiking	*1,1
 wiking	?
 blackburn1	or (-1,1) (1,1) (1,-1) (-1,-1)
 heiko	wiking, sent
 heiko	wiking, dont need the corners
 heiko	just do n gaussians per dim
 heiko	and set distance between them to a large value
 heiko	the picture I sent is for d=2
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	yeah because i was about to say what if one wants 10 gaussians but with d=2
 wiking	ok so what do you reckon the distance should be?
 heiko	5 should be enough
 blackburn1	heiko: I found a way to evaluate OvR things
 heiko	but dimension wise
 heiko	not euclidean
 heiko	blackburn, tell me
-!- puffin444 [62e3926e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.98.227.146.110] has joined #shogun
 wiking	heiko: i.e. 0,0; 0,5; 5,0; 5,5; 10,0 etc
 wiking	right?
 heiko	yeah for d=2
 wiking	for d=3 5 would be good i.e. 0,0,0; 0,5,0 etc?
 blackburn1	heiko: I am adding an options to store all scores in multiclass labels
 heiko	dim=3 would be a 3d cube " filled with" gaussians
 blackburn1	the multiclassovrevaluation computes things via binaryclassevaluation
 heiko	great
 heiko	ok
 wiking	damn i need a grid generator code
 heiko	blackburn1, custom fonts with python latex are a pain is the a**
 heiko	computer modern is quite easy
 heiko	what do you think?
 blackburn1	heiko: python latex?
 heiko	yeah, latex typo in pytohn plots
 heiko	for tutorial
 blackburn1	matplotlib?
 heiko	yeah
 blackburn1	I used custom fonts there
 blackburn1	without much pain
 heiko	could you send me a script with that?
 blackburn1	pain is to use cyrillic
 blackburn1	:D
 heiko	like a small example where you use the pathpazo
 blackburn1	you would never imagine how much pain cyrillic brings
 heiko	lol :) ok I stop complaining
 blackburn1	heh
 blackburn1	okay let me find something
 blackburn1	heiko: all you need is to put a few things into rc
 heiko	ok
 heiko	do you have a script?
 blackburn1	wait a min
 wiking	heiko: this shoudl work afaik
 wiking	-               mean.random(0.0, 10.0);
 wiking	+               mean.zero();
 wiking	+               for (index_t k = 0; k < dim; ++k)
 wiking	+                       mean[k] = i*grid_distance;
 wiking	or?
 wiking	where i is the i-th gaussian
 wiking	so basically it's 0,0... 5,5... 10,10...
 wiking	etc
 blackburn1	heiko: https://gist.github.com/3342349
 blackburn1	lines 83,84,85
 heiko	wiking, plot in 2d and 3d then youll see :)
 blackburn1	for 4d case use the force!
 blackburn1	:D
 wiking	heiko: display_matrix is not working :D
 blackburn1	heiko: but show won't work
 wiking	or it does? :)
 heiko	it does
 wiking	oh yeah it does i'm just looking at it on a wrong way
 blackburn1	heiko:  show doesn't work here with latex at all
 blackburn1	heiko: neither with custom nor default latex fonts
 heiko	blackburn, this is all annoying
 heiko	why isnt there an export button?
 blackburn1	heiko: export?
 heiko	i hate this messy stuff! argh
 heiko	save-as you know
 heiko	its 2012
 blackburn1	heiko: it is in matplotlib
 heiko	but it doesnt integrate into latex
 heiko	It would be great to let latex do the typo
 heiko	then everything would look much nicer
 blackburn1	ehmm
 blackburn1	heiko: in my script latex is used with custom font and saves to .pdf
 blackburn1	what else do you need? :)
 heiko	yeah this works, but is it comfortable? :)
 heiko	thats my point
 heiko	just complaining in general :D
 blackburn1	comfortable in which way?
 blackburn1	I think there is a way to make show work too
 blackburn1	with latex
 blackburn1	heiko: nicholas wants to normalize train and test data with preprocessor inited with train data
 heiko	blackburn1, what does that mean?
 blackburn1	heiko: for example you compute mean of train vectors
 blackburn1	and subtract it both from train and test vector
 blackburn1	s
 blackburn1	during the process of evaluation
 heiko	ok
 blackburn1	got it?
 heiko	so he wants no normalise training data for each fold?
 blackburn1	yes
 heiko	puh
 blackburn1	heiko: it is next on my list
 heiko	preprocessors cannot do that?
 heiko	ah ok
 blackburn1	heiko: they can
 blackburn1	but we do not handle it
 blackburn1	heiko: we should call init in cross validation I think
 blackburn1	before training
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	I forgot that
 heiko	before
 heiko	its very important for some kernels
 blackburn1	you could do that too if you have time
 heiko	maybe
 blackburn1	while I am messing with ovr multiclass :)
 heiko	I am currently getting organised with the rest for my gsoc
 heiko	this sigmoid fitting still has to come
 heiko	and mkl weights per fold output
 blackburn1	heiko: I spent some time on pre-release stuff already btw
 blackburn1	there are ~100 doc warnings left and I checked tests
 heiko	nice, yeah I also fixed a few warning on the weekend
 heiko	then there is still the migration stuff
 heiko	and reference counts for sgvec/mat
 blackburn1	we need to release on 1st of September
 blackburn1	I like that date :D

 wiking	fucking hell how do you plot this shit in matlab fast?
 wiking	or python
 wiking	i have a matrix of 2 rows and n columns
 blackburn1	from pylab import *
 blackburn1	X = array([yourmatrix])
 blackburn1	scatter(X[0,:],X[1,:])
 blackburn1	show()
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	wy this shit only shows 1 points :))0
 blackburn1	I expect your X is transposed then
 wiking	noup :)
 wiking	i'm switching to python
 blackburn1	print X.shape
 wiking	i've tried scatter in matlab
 wiking	should do the same
 wiking	installing scipy.. forgot to reinstall it after os upgrade :X
 wiking	i should be able to copypaste the output of display_matrix into python :S
 wiking	heiko: SHIIITFACK
 wiking	:)
 wiking	why it no working:)
 heiko	hey wiking, calm down
 heiko	whats happening?
 wiking	:)
 heiko	one has to patient with plotting
 wiking	i've plotted
 wiking	but i think it should be ok
 wiking	as a lot of them are actually 0,0
 wiking	i mean for the mean =[0,0]
 wiking	the samples are (0,0)
 wiking	thus when i plot i don't see it that there's equal amount there
 wiking	as around the other grid point
 wiking	but as far as i can see from the matrix
 wiking	it should be alright
 wiking	still
 wiking	it cannot separate it
 heiko	it also has to be ok from the plot
 heiko	matrix reading is left for keanu reeves :D
 wiking	ok
 wiking	this is weird
 wiking	let me pastebin it
 heiko	ok
 wiking	this is the matrix
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/1ykKNze5
 wiking	d=2
 wiking	and 2 gaussians
 wiking	where mean_1=(5,5)
 wiking	mean_2=(10,10)
 wiking	ah no i'm sorry
 wiking	mean_1= (15,15) and mean_2=(30,30)
 wiking	and variance is always [1,0;0,1]
 heiko	hey man I cant read that
 heiko	need images
 wiking	ok here's the image... (sending in email)
 wiking	sent
 heiko	I see
 heiko	but what happened to the hypercubes?
 wiking	?
 wiking	it's just dim=2
 wiking	so no hypercube
 wiking	damn
 wiking	i think the problem is the way i set the matrix elements
 heiko	but in two dimension you should get this grid in the image i sent you
 wiking	yep
 heiko	sorry phone was ringing
 wiking	the problem is the filling of the matrix
 wiking	i've printed separately the generated samples
 wiking	and it's good
 wiking	this is with 2 gaussians with 2 dim
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/xM2VfBKh
 wiking	the problem is that how i fill up the matrix
 heiko	you are adding the value to each dimension
 heiko	thats why you get this diagonal structure
 heiko	why not make this grid?
 wiking	heiko: yeah i get that diagonal struct
 wiking	but mainly that's not the problem
 wiking	i mean it should work with this diag struct as well
 wiking	or?
 wiking	but the problem is that how i fill up the matrix with these vectors
 wiking	i think it was a miracle that it was working with SVMOcas at the first place
 heiko	yes it should work
 heiko	really, oh no :)
 wiking	yeah
 heiko	isnt there a reference dataset that you could use?
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i have data!
 wiking	and it actually looks good
 wiking	although multiclass couldn't separate it still
 wiking	heiko: sent u an email
 wiking	with a graph where the means of the gaussians: 15,15 and 30,30
 heiko	wiking these should be fine
 wiking	multiclass cannot separate it
 wiking	 :D
 wiking	neither multiclass liblinear
 wiking	nor multiclass ocas
 heiko	are you sure you did not switch dimensions or something?
 wiking	well now i'm going to print out the matrices separately
 wiking	after i devide this big matrix of samples
 wiking	into train and test dataset
 CIA-39	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rc49b8cf / (8 files in 5 dirs): Added multiclass OVR evaluation - http://git.io/KzIHsw
 wiking	the plot is very similar obviously
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	i'll print out the labeling as well next to the vector values
 wiking	as i really cannot see wtf is happening
 heiko	blackburn, matplotlib is so bad I can't believe it
 heiko	Now 1h trying to get along with these plots
 blackburn1	heiko: what's up?
 blackburn1	what is so wrong with it?
 heiko	everything is so complicated
 wiking	hah
 wiking	i'm right
 blackburn1	heiko: yes it is very flexible so complex
 wiking	heiko: http://pastebin.com/MM4pzW11
 wiking	this is the train set
 wiking	and the test set is very similar
 heiko	blackburn, how to change the image size
 heiko	I fail to do so
 heiko	wiking, and?
 wiking	heiko: and everything is classified after the training as 0
 blackburn1	heiko: image size?
 blackburn1	size of what exactly?
 wiking	or no sorry
 wiking	no everything is classified as 1
 heiko	blackburn, something in order to have a latex compatible size
 blackburn1	heiko: why to do that?
 heiko	because scaling looks bad
 wiking	heiko: and basically what it does according to the debug that it takes the 0 examples as training errors
 heiko	thats why I want to produce plots that fit without scaling
 blackburn1	heiko: scaling of fonts?
 heiko	blackburn1, yes
 heiko	wiking, so theres an error in multiclass?
 blackburn1	heiko: okay I'd suggest to tune fontsize
 wiking	heiko: i have no idea... neither multiclassocas nor multiclassliblinear can separate this problem
 heiko	blackburn, no Just figure size, I set the font size in the figure to the same as in tutorial, which is 11
 heiko	wiking, try libsvm
 blackburn1	heiko: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332289/how-do-you-change-the-size-of-figures-drawn-with-matplotlib
 heiko	without multiclass
 wiking	heiko: svmocas works smoothly
 heiko	blackburn you joker, I have tried the first 10 google entries
 blackburn1	heiko: and?
 heiko	they dont work thats the problem
 blackburn1	no way, why?
 wiking	heiko: w/o any missclassification
 wiking	heiko: w/o any missclassification
 wiking	sorry
 wiking	wrong window
 wiking	:)
 heiko	blackburn, and I refuse to type in more that 10 lines for that problem btw ::D
 blackburn1	heiko: so rc('figure', figsize=(5, 10)) doesn't work?
 heiko	it looks like, but then when I save, things are discarded
 heiko	and when I call savefig
 heiko	the resulting pdf is empty
 heiko	and thats when I started complaining :)
 blackburn1	hmm it doesn't work okay
 wiking	i've used not liblinear instead of libsvm
 wiking	WARN] reaching max number of iterations
 wiking	Using -s 2 may be faster(also see liblinear FAQ)
 blackburn1	heiko:
 blackburn1	figure(figsize=(size in inches, size in inches))
 blackburn1	just do that
 blackburn1	it works here
 wiking	comeeooon wtf is with this :)
-!- blackburn1 [~blackburn@109.226.80.43] has left #shogun []

 heiko	blackburn, I just figured out the problem
 wiking	heiko: with linear kernel?
 heiko	wiking yes
 heiko	and not multiclass
 blackburn1	arghh I got why I have headache
 blackburn1	I forgot to eat today
 blackburn1	heiko: so now it works?
 heiko	blackburn, not really, still looks horrible, this causes me a headache
 heiko	font size is wrong and stuff
 heiko	since this scales things

 heiko	its so stupid, since it is an easy problem that every scientist has to approach
 blackburn1	heiko: font size of what?
 blackburn1	axes?
 heiko	I dont get why there are no good solutions
 heiko	no all
 blackburn1	wait but is size of plot correct?
 wiking	heiko: works just fine
 wiking	heiko: as with liblinear and svmocas
 wiking	when it's binary
 CIA-39	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra6cdaf5 / src/shogun/evaluation/CrossValidation.cpp : Added preprocessor init calls in crossvalidation - http://git.io/gzmNOw
 wiking	binary classification just works fine
 wiking	heiko: i've tried changing dimension
 wiking	but that did not confuse at all the binary classifiers
 heiko	then there is a bug somewhere
 wiking	heiko: in case of multiclass if i put higher dimension
 wiking	then the error gets smaller
 wiking	but still nothing near to the binary case
 wiking	i just need a confirmation
 wiking	ok i'm gonna feed this train/test pair
 wiking	directly to liblinear
 wiking	just to see wtf
 heiko	wiking I dont know
 heiko	it should give the same answer when you hand in the same (easy) data
 wiking	heiko: heheh let's see i'm very very curious now
 wiking	Accuracy = 36% (27/75)

 wiking	hehe
 wiking	ok this si just not separable
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	heiko: any ideas how we could solve this that there's a datagenerator function that creates a dataset that is separable in a way that i can do a unittest for it?
 heiko	do the unit test on a dataset that is definately lin. separable
 heiko	you could use the mean dataset
 heiko	but actually
 heiko	I would use a fixed one
 heiko	so that you can assert outputs
 wiking	heiko: heheh so add a header file that has the dataset?
 heiko	no
 wiking	and one could include it when he wants to test a classifier?
 heiko	just produce it in your code
 wiking	heiko: ok how ?:)
 wiking	as the gaussian doesn't work
 wiking	:)
 heiko	wiking, just via signs or so

@sonney2k	heiko, about now we have to start to organize formalities w/ google
 heiko	sonney2k, not really, but I got a friend who studies law visiting, he hinted me some reference to check stuff out, Ill do it later this week
@sonney2k	blackburn1, bow before the leader ;-)
 heiko	busy with plotting currently
 heiko	hope to sort that out soon
@sonney2k	heiko, ok - it is starting to be a bit pressing though
 heiko	yeah, sorry that this took so long
@sonney2k	wiking, n4nd0 what is CData?
 blackburn1	we need an offshore to keep money we get from stealing people and oil
@sonney2k	wiking, n4nd0 it sounds like a very generic name doing what CFeatures was invented for - no?
 alexlovesdata	why not an island close to the pacific trash vortex??

 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is what I called CStructuredData
 n4nd0	wiking prefers to use CData for that
 n4nd0	to be honest, I am ok with any of them...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, structured data is CFeatures + CLabels right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no

@sonney2k	n4nd0, is you PR updated - so show I re-review it?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I did the changes you told me in your last revision
 n4nd0	and now I have just rebased solving a couple of minor conflicts
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok then let me have a quick look
@sonney2k	n4nd0, what I still don't understand is why you didn't replace the constructor
@sonney2k	SGMatrix< ST >* feats, int32_t num_vecs, int32_t num_feats
@sonney2k	with the SGMatrixStringList<ST> one
@sonney2k	then we could create typemaps for that type

@sonney2k	should rather be one that takes an SGNDArray as input
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok with the first thing about introducing SGMatrixList
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but the second change, it is another different constructor
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please explain - what it is supposed to do then
 n4nd0	sonney2k: have you seen the explanation in the header file?

 wiking	thnx
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is the one where I get *parse error*
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hehe where?
 n4nd0	so you construct a MatrixFeatures (a list of matrices)
 n4nd0	from a big matrix
 n4nd0	you give it a matrix [ ........ ]
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah but why not use SGNDArray then? you can have a tensor that is NxMxL big
@sonney2k	where L is the number of matrices
@sonney2k	and NxM the matrix size
 n4nd0	and partition it in a list of [...][...][...]
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, but why not to have also one constructor like this?
 n4nd0	I mean, it can be useful to do it from a matrix
 n4nd0	I just did it to use it from CTwoStateModel::simulate_data
 n4nd0	I ported a function from the hmsvm toolbox that simulates two data and stores it in a matrix
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I understand that constructor now though I don't like it - it is probably the same as having an SGVector as input for a constructor of SGMatrix
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	anyways this one certainly is not a showstopper
 n4nd0	I can modify the simulate data function so this constructor is not required though
 n4nd0	in any case I don't like the idea of getting rid of this constructor ...
 n4nd0	I can use data generated from the hmsvm toolbox in matlab from python scripts thanks to it
 n4nd0	see examples python_modular/structure_hmsvm_mosek.py
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well you could easily do one reshape to get this to work then
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: should I change the other constructor now and ammend?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes do that now and then let blackburn1 or so merge :D
 n4nd0	I will stay here to feel guilty if a disaster happens :-O

 wiking	that i have to redesign now
 KMcQuisten	Not so much an issue.

@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, I would very much prefer if you do these things publicly on the mailinglist
 KMcQuisten	That's fine, sonney.  I can certainly do that.  I was just hoping to have a conversation first.
 KMcQuisten	I don't have any bugs to report.  everything seems to be working as it should
 wiking	hahah cache and pipelining kicked in in my cpu
 blackburn1	sonney2k: we failed to discuss some issues at mailing list :)
 wiking	compiling is getting faster and faster :)
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: what do you mean?
 wiking	blackburn1: i guess he means that all's good ;)
 blackburn1	no about chainsaw and code
 blackburn1	sounds scary
 KMcQuisten	Hehehe.  Not so much scary
 blackburn1	anyway please elaborate
 KMcQuisten	Here's my take:  When constructing cross-validation, you must pass the evaluationCriterion object to the crossValidation object, which calculates the statistics, averages them, and then passes them to the EvaluationResult object.
 blackburn1	rigggght
 blackburn1	so?
 KMcQuisten	I think thats backwards.  The crossValidation object should pass the observed/predicted pairs to the evaluationResult object, and the evaluationCriterion object should be passed to the evaluationResult using a method.  This way one run of crossvalidation could be used, and then multiple evaluationCriterion could be thrown at it to look at CV results in multiple ways without having to rerun a full CV for each evaluationcriterion on
 KMcQuisten	As it stands, It's impossible for me to actually look at the obs/pred pairs generated by the builting cv, so I can't do more in depth analysis of my CV results if I use the builtin methods
 KMcQuisten	I'd like the opportunity to refactor the code to make it more flexible
 KMcQuisten	If there's a formal proposal process for such things I'd like to follow it, of course.
 blackburn1	if you want to improve anything just do and sent a PR
 blackburn1	(pull request)
 KMcQuisten	Yep Yep.
 KMcQuisten	I know that.  I have my own branch forked off.
 KMcQuisten	I'd rather tell folks what i'm planning to do first.  Common courtesy and all, since it would involve some big changes.
 KMcQuisten	sonney, would you like me to write something up for the mailing list before I get started?
 blackburn1	sonney2k: ^
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: so you want to use multiple
 blackburn1	evaluations
@sonney2k	http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/autonomous-robotic-plane-flies-indoors-0810.html
@sonney2k	blackburn1, any idea where gsomix is
 blackburn1	sonney2k: will appear soon
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I am surprised to see kind of machine leraning here
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@80.234.28.229] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	good evening
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  Without having to completely rerun CV for each criterion.  Assuming the splitting criterion doesn't change, each time CV is run on a dataset with a fixed set of parameters, it would produce the same observed/predicted label pairs, so why generate them over and over for different evaluations?
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: but you optimize only one criterion right?
 KMcQuisten	This would also allow output for evaluations to return different types, and return them as values to wrapped languages, instead of having to rely only on stdout
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, I understand this desire - but what do you do if you have test data sets? then you would need to store all outputs for all evaluations in memory right?
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey - so what's going on? did you manage to do the example fixes?
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: but why no to refactor modelselectionoutput a little to store things?
@sonney2k	gsomix, (or did I miss anything?)
 blackburn1	not to print but to store I mean
 blackburn1	it already receives all you need
 blackburn1	and it supports custom additional evaluations too
 KMcQuisten	See, this is why I wanted to talk about this before I did anything :) .   I'm still familiarizing myself with the modelselection code, so I am unsure.  Does it allow for the comparison of arbitrary sets of features and kernels, or must those be fixed and only the parameters varied?
 gsomix	sonney2k, hey. what do you mean? I plan to debug my DirectorDotFeatures example and solve problem with SGVector in directors. But little later. At now I'm working on zero-copying mechanism. At next week plan to start work on new typemaps for modelselection (it seems, that it's little easy that sg in director or zero-copy).
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: why to do that?
 gsomix	ah, and I forgot about examples for Labels.
 gsomix	too bad
 blackburn1	I am a bit lost, comparison of what?
@sonney2k	gsomix, that is quite a bit of work - not sure how you want to do that within 2 weeks...
 blackburn1	sonney2k: why to +1?
 shogun-buildbot	build #342 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/342  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@sonney2k	blackburn1, if I understand correctly ocas uses labels 1... <nr_classes>
@sonney2k	in shogun we use 0...<nr_classes-1>
 blackburn1	sonney2k: there is no +1 in multiclass ocas we had before
@sonney2k	so we should +1 shogun's labels for ocas to work
 gsomix	sonney2k, 2 weeks? when is the release of new version?
@sonney2k	hopefully 1st of september
 gsomix	oops
 KMcQuisten	Comparison of the CV accuracies for SVMs applied to my data under various choices of feature expression, kernel selection, and kernel parameter.
 KMcQuisten	blackburn1: ^
 gsomix	ok
@sonney2k	but we need at least 1 week to just do testing / bugfixing / documentation an no more feature additions
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: okay lets specify things here
 gsomix	zero-copying mechanism - 4-5 hours
@sonney2k	I would actually say 2 weeks ...
 gsomix	solve problem with SGVector  - 1-2 day
@sonney2k	gsomix, well do what you can...
 KMcQuisten	blackburn1: Yes, let's.
@sonney2k	gsomix, what is the new SGVector problem?
@sonney2k	gsomix, I thought you resolved it?
 gsomix	sonney2k, nope.
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: cross validation splits to train/test subsets
 KMcQuisten	Yes
 blackburn1	you need these indices, right?
 blackburn1	when you construct parameter tree you may specify everything you want to vary
 KMcQuisten	blackburn1:  No, I don't .  I don't want to change anything about how the CV code does splitting, training, or testing of the untrained portion of the data.  All that's fine, and I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
 gsomix	sonney2k, LibLinear's train in my example says that 'not a numpy or... bla-bla'. I need to debug it.
 wiking	sonney2k blackburn1 it's now good at is... ;)
 gsomix	not many time, I think
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: okay
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: so you need a few more evaluation to see
 blackburn1	evaluations*
 blackburn1	are you ok with optimizing by only one evaluation parameter?
-!- sr___ [u5548@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-abthilurbjnvpfrb] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	3
 n4nd0	wrong tab...
@sonney2k	blackburn1, wiking I think the best thing to do would be to compare mc ocas output (of stand alone ocas) against shogun once
@sonney2k	and then feel better
 wiking	sonney2k: :DDDD
 wiking	sonney2k: i've compared libocas v0.95 and how that was ported in shogun
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  I don't want to pass multiple evaluation criterion to the crossvalidation object.  My point is that structurally I don't think the evaluationcriterion belongs in the CV code.  The CV code should just spit out obs/pred pairs to the result object, and the evaluationCriterions can be passed to the result object.
 wiking	sonney2k: and there the -1 was removed basically
@sonney2k	gsomix, well then do 0-copy now ...
 gsomix	aha
 KMcQuisten	The question is, as sonney said, how that will work for very very large datasets
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, make it optional...
@sonney2k	then it is ok
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: but why not to use modelselectionoutput?
@sonney2k	wiking, what where the class labels you used?
@sonney2k	0...2?
 blackburn1	I don't get that point yet
 KMcQuisten	I have to look more into the modelselection code before I can give you a good answer to that.
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@56.Red-81-33-212.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: you may add a few more evaluation instances to modelselectionoutput
 blackburn1	and it will be printed
 KMcQuisten	If that's a way I can get what I want without messing with code, then it's fine,
 wiking	sonney2k: yeps
 blackburn1	if you want to make it not printed but stored - we can do that
 KMcQuisten	Aha.  That's the other problem.  I'd rather just get that value and keep in internally rather than having to scrape from stdout
@sonney2k	blackburn1, would that enable us to also store trained models?
 KMcQuisten	But I can conceive of eval criteria that aren't simple floats, but rather arrays of floats, i.e. a list of binned accuracies across the entire prediction range of a regression problem
 blackburn1	sonney2k: it prints trained model right now
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@56.Red-81-33-212.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	wiking, I would suggest to email vojtech (after reaing ocas doc)
 blackburn1	if you pass model selection output to the instance
@sonney2k	blackburn1, *store*
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes, if we change print to store - it would enable to do that
 blackburn1	but I planned to do that optionally of course
@sonney2k	wiking, I am pretty sure he uses labels 1...nr_class
@sonney2k	makes sense
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten:
 blackburn1	so now you may put
 blackburn1	ModelSelectionOutput instance
 blackburn1	to ModelSelection instance
 blackburn1	and it will print stuff you need
 blackburn1	you may add anything to ModelSelectionOutput
 blackburn1	like more evaluations
 blackburn1	if you add some new complex evaluation I'd suggest to add its handling to the ModelSelectionOutput
 blackburn1	I will change it to store things today/tomorrow
 KMcQuisten	That sounds fine to me.  I will take a look and see what I can do.

 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: I just have to think how can we add this kind of storage here
 KMcQuisten	Well, hold up on that.  It might not need to be stored if it can just be calculated and returned
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, well it can take quite a while...
* sonney2k Zzzz...
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: I hardly have an API in mind for that
 KMcQuisten	blackburn1:  Ok, cool.  I'll familiarize myself a bit more with the modelselection code and hopefully I will be able to see how it can help me.
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: remind me please - are you using python?
 KMcQuisten	Yes
 blackburn1	the problem is that storage should be quite generic
 KMcQuisten	Yes.
 KMcQuisten	with the SO machines and all being put together it has to work for them too
 KMcQuisten	not everyon'es outputs are nice floats. :)
 blackburn1	well evaluation is always float - a score
 KMcQuisten	Yes, I know, but they predictions that the machines make are not always nice floats
 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn1: I updated the branch with the new constructor
 KMcQuisten	and I can think of ways that the score is actualyl an array of scores, as opposedto a single float, so even that assumption isn't quite right wither
 KMcQuisten	either
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: would be nice to have map: ParameterCombination -> some bunch of results
 blackburn1	but it is very inconvenient for user
 KMcQuisten	Perhaps.  I'm not entirely sure we're talking about the same thing here.
 KMcQuisten	I want to dig into the modelselection code before we discuss this further.
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: okay
 blackburn1	you are not the only user that wants that stuff btw
 blackburn1	second one already :)
 n4nd0	blackburn1: should we merge or do you prefer to wait for Soeren until tom?
 KMcQuisten	RIghto
 blackburn1	n4nd0: did you have to include .cpp?
 blackburn1	that sounds to be a blocker for you lets just merge
 n4nd0	yes, it looks like this now
 n4nd0	from SGMatrixList.h it is included SGMatrix.h
 blackburn1	however I do not like that that much
 blackburn1	ah
 blackburn1	is .cpp included?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: do you mind to make it static method of sgmatrixlist?
 n4nd0	in SGMatrix.h it is SGMatrixList forward declared
 n4nd0	and from SGMatrix.cpp, SGMatrixList.cpp is included
 n4nd0	blackburn1: yeah, but I can tell you why it is done like that
 n4nd0	blackburn1: ok
 blackburn1	n4nd0: including .cpp could be bad
 n4nd0	blackburn1: it is just because of the style in which templated classes are defined in SHOGUN
 n4nd0	blackburn1: because it is in the .cpp where the types are specified
 blackburn1	yeah
 blackburn1	i see
 blackburn1	n4nd0: anyway .cpp should not be included - it can become a mystery problem later
 n4nd0	I agree
 n4nd0	I am changing it to static right now :)
 blackburn1	KMcQuisten: there are now 3 guys wanting to check xval results in a fancy way
 KMcQuisten	Hehe.  Fancy
