 Saurabh7	wiking, any idea how to solve this:
 Saurabh7	CDynamicObjectArray -> get_element() always returns SGObject pointer
 Saurabh7	which cannot be cast to anything else in say python interface
 Saurabh7	and some functions do return those arrays

@wiking	CaBa: well the subset is not thread safe
@wiking	which is a long standing feature request actually :)
@wiking	to make it thread safe

 CaBa	Saurabh7: I saw some classes provide a static function obtain_from_generic() that does the cast...
 CaBa	Saurabh7: so adding such a function to ParameterCombination would probably "fix" the problem from yesterday
 CaBa	wiking: do you work with python?
@wiking	CaBa: i try not to :)
 arianepaola	hello everyone
 arianepaola	wiking: ping
-!- sanuj [0e8bc402@gateway/web/freenode/ip.14.139.196.2] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	wiking: there?
@wiking	y
@wiking	just a sec
 sanuj	cool
 CaBa	wiking: C++ then?
@wiking	CaBa: yes
 CaBa	I begin to wonder if I should do the ML stuff natively right away, too...
 sanuj	besser82_: yo \o/
 sanuj	Saurabh7: hello :)
 sanuj	besser82_: how do i get started with dynaplugz
 Saurabh7	CaBa, ah yes that should do it, complicated it too much in my head :)
 Saurabh7	sanuj, Hey
 sanuj	Saurabh7: did you register on Payoneer?
 Saurabh7	sanuj, I had account from back in '14
 sanuj	okay
 Saurabh7	any issues ?
 sanuj	there is some issue regarding INR and USD that i saw on the gsoc mailing list
 sanuj	confused me
 sanuj	what did you do about it
 sanuj	Saurabh7: ^
 Saurabh7	i used USD and its still the same
 Saurabh7	was better back then dont know current state actually
 Saurabh7	usd was better
 sanuj	so the bank converts that for you
 CaBa	wiking: i'm trying to parallelize model selection in python but something seems fishy... as if all threads are blocked while one is doing cross validation...
 sanuj	Saurabh7: what about taxes?
 Saurabh7	sanuj, yup
@wiking	CaBa: hahah yeah
@wiking	shit can happen with python in multiprocessing
@wiking	sanuj: what'sup
 sanuj	wiking: i managed to get SWIG working with some simple c++ code
@wiking	hey
@wiking	but wait
@wiking	i mean there's a whole framework
@wiking	of swig
@wiking	in current code
@wiking	so dont start from nothing
 sanuj	and i understand how proxy classes work and how swig manages templates
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	yeah i looked at that
 CaBa	wiking: anything i should know about? i'm fairly new to python i must admit, but the code i wrote seems fairly parallel unless i enter x-validation ;)
@wiking	CaBa: read about GIL = global interpreter loc
@wiking	*lock
@wiking	python is a ridicolous language
@wiking	:)
 sanuj	wiking: what is the best approach to take for the swig interface for tags framework
 sanuj	i'll have to write that from scratch
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	lets first concentrate on shogun-base
 sanuj	wiking: and shogun-base is dynaplugz?
 CaBa	wiking: in other words - i can't parallelize shogun logic on the python level?
 sanuj	i mean its obviously incomplete for now
@wiking	CaBa: dunno never tried
@wiking	Heiko would know it better
@wiking	or mailing list
 CaBa	wiking: this is pretty frustrating... Do I understand this correctly, python provides threading but pretty much nothing is executed concurrently?
 CaBa	or at least the reference interpreter doesn't allow concurrency?
@wiking	well there's multiprocessing package
@wiking	but yeah it's a bit hacky

@wiking	and it's totally non posix
 CaBa	i see. all of this smells like major headache :(

 sanuj	HeikoS: wazzup? :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: wazuuup :D
 sanuj	are we hosting the cookbook pages anywhere yet?
 sanuj	i am about to graduate
 sanuj	going back home on 14th
@HeikoS	great congrats
 sanuj	thanks
@HeikoS	yes they are at shogun.ml/cookbook/latest
@HeikoS	but its not ready to be announced yet
@HeikoS	so dont spread
 sanuj	yes, i wont ;)
@HeikoS	need to work on design and some details
 sanuj	just wanted to check what all pages we have till now
 sanuj	was thinking about which cookbook page i should write next
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	yeah would be good to add more
@HeikoS	basically all the standard ML algos should come first

@wiking	CaBa: ++ the reference counter of an object
@wiking	the pair of it is SG_UNREF
 CaBa	wiking: for what? gc?
@wiking	hehehe c++ doesn't have a gc
@wiking	u manage your own memory
 CaBa	i'm aware of that. thats why i'm asking whether that's the way *you* do gc ;)

@wiking	yep
 CaBa	CKernel* casted=dynamic_cast<CKernel*>(kernel);
 CaBa	REQUIRE(casted, "CKernel::obtain_from_generic(): Error, provided object of class \"%s\" is not a subclass of CKernel!\n", kernel->get_name());
 CaBa	wiking: how is that a valid subclass check?
 CaBa	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/compare/develop...lkuchenb:fix/ParameterCombinationCast
 CaBa	wiking: do i still need any checking for this to be proper? and how about that ref counter...
 CaBa	wiking: other obtain_from_generic() implementations often derive from known base classes which have known members to check their type... I found CKernel casts SGObject and has this wirred REQUIRE check that I posted...
