@sonney2k	blackburn, around now
@sonney2k	what's up?
 blackburn	not actual I hope
 blackburn	I really forgot what is get_computed_dot_feature_vector
 blackburn	or so
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw different suggestion
 blackburn	about committing
@sonney2k	get_computed_dot_feature_vector gives you a vector that is computed / you have to free it afterwards
 blackburn	I think we could use issues fully: then implementing new feature or changing something one could create new issue
 blackburn	then commit with mentioning it
 blackburn	with just writing #378
 blackburn	or any other number :)
 blackburn	then we wouldn't have to work with different branches, etc
@sonney2k	we used to do that already with trac... but when you do lots of things it is easy to forget that
 blackburn	and no need to wait
@sonney2k	no need to wait?
 blackburn	yes, commit is already here
 blackburn	but there would be some thread for discussion
@sonney2k	does it change anything except that we put fixed in #231 the issue / commit
 blackburn	nothing, but gives us ability to group commits by issues
-!- axitkhurana [b49531e7@gateway/web/freenode/ip.180.149.49.231] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 blackburn	and discuss it
 blackburn	btw scikits-learn do it ~ this way
 blackburn	well branches are good, but I am afraid are slow
 blackburn	to work with
@sonney2k	I don't favour branches
@sonney2k	I favor pull requests for everyone :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I meant that
 blackburn	sonney2k: heh Gunnar moved too?
@sonney2k	anyways, using issues is a good idea - it is only difficult to keep track of them when there are too many
 blackburn	I thought only Chris did
 blackburn	sonney2k: but I do not know how to combine issues and pull requests
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@49.249.161.125] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: 'the Locally Linear Embedding' vs 'Locally Linear Embedding'? what is right?
@sonney2k	w/o the
 blackburn	not right w/ the?
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: and 'the ARPACK' vs 'APPACK'?
 blackburn	never thought I'll have doubts about it
@sonney2k	same
@sonney2k	w/o the
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh I had another question. how did you get citing for Plearn in your 2007 paper?
 blackburn	I tend to cite url but..
@sonney2k	I don't understand the question
 blackburn	sonney2k: they do not provide any cite information
 blackburn	I need to cite it somehow I guess
@sonney2k	you need to create some citation for that
@sonney2k	jmlr doesn't like urls
 blackburn	sonney2k: url citation?
@sonney2k	argh! http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/99/steps/configure/logs/stdio
 blackburn	argh what?
@sonney2k	it didn't fail upon configure
@sonney2k	I mean it needs swig 2.0.4 nowadays
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	but I hopefully fixed the new buildbot
@sonney2k	it was always failing (didn't detect numpy though it is installed)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah seen it
 blackburn	sonney2k: is web-site citing @article?
@sonney2k	how can you?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well I have seen it fails with numpy not detected :)
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	now I hope you observe that it works too :)
 blackburn	I observe wrong things
 blackburn	e.g. missed arpack failure
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you know if PLearn died already?
@sonney2k	hmmhh, when was the last update?
 blackburn	last docs was updated 2006
 blackburn	hmm no trunk was updated 2011-09
 blackburn	but I guess it slowed down totally
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem is I can't select authors
 blackburn	worst doc ever
 blackburn	hmm there is a hotel sonnenburg in osterreich
 blackburn	:D
 CIA-29	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rc0d0193 / src/configure :
 CIA-29	shogun: When swig >= 2.0.4 is not detected - disable modular interfaces
 CIA-29	shogun: To this end
 CIA-29	shogun: - return 1 in assert_version
 CIA-29	shogun: - don't set $_interface_modular to yes but keep auto state - http://git.io/Tkmwug
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is even a city named sonnenburg in germany
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	to bad the Nazis abused it
 blackburn	well nazis did strange things :)
@sonney2k	welcome to concentration camp sonnenburg ...
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	what a 'gift' to you
@sonney2k	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenburg
 blackburn	ah poland
 blackburn	sonney2k: were in germany any camps?
 blackburn	internally I mean
@sonney2k	of course
@sonney2k	ok swig 2.0.4 on the buildbot
 blackburn	I wonder cause it looks like most of them were in poland
 blackburn	sonney2k: which buildbot is running win 7?
@sonney2k	none - I didn't find the time to install all dependencies
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/lisitsyn12a.pdf could you please take a look on url citations on last page?
@sonney2k	looks good to me
 blackburn	ok thanks
 shogun-buildbot	build #421 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/421
@sonney2k	haha :-) http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/waterfall
@sonney2k	green all green
 blackburn	sonney2k: sorry if I bother you with my paper efforts :)
 blackburn	nightly_default?
 blackburn	sonney2k: should address under name be fully available for me?
@sonney2k	that was still when my configure did fail
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	(fixed above)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wish I was still at univiersity + your supervisor :)
 blackburn	gsoc would be announced in two weeks
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	gsoc already?
@sonney2k	was it last year?
 blackburn	sonney2k: last year it was announced on jan 24
@sonney2k	I could push you more :)
@sonney2k	uh!
@sonney2k	then we have to hurry up producing ideas and announce things on the list!
 blackburn	sonney2k: well start for organizations was on 28 feb
 blackburn	January 24:
 blackburn	Program announced.
 blackburn	February 28:19:00 UTC
 blackburn	Mentoring organizations can begin submitting applications to Google.
@sonney2k	doesn't matter - it is important to get people interested
@sonney2k	and maybe we get some feedback
@sonney2k	we should try hard to update the ideas page until end of this week
@sonney2k	and then ask for feedback
 blackburn	update with?
@sonney2k	new ideas
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding your abstract:
@sonney2k	criterion an implemented -> criterion and implemented
@sonney2k	it
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	it?
@sonney2k	criterion an implemented -> criterion and implemented it as part of the SHOGUN ...
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	not the, right?
 blackburn	no 'the' I mean
@sonney2k	the in this case
 blackburn	sonney2k: damn I do not understand then :(
 blackburn	provided by the SHOGUN?
@sonney2k	All methods were implemented using the state-of-the-art algorithms -> All methods were implemented using the respective state-of-the-art algorithms.
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	All methods were implemented using the state-of-the-art algorithms -> All methods were implemented using the respective state-of-the-art algorithms and were parallelized where possible.
@sonney2k	performance and distributed under GPLv3 license. -> performance and distributed under the GPLv3 license.
 blackburn	sonney2k: where is 'efficient method formulations' part?
@sonney2k	blackburn, isn't chris working with you on this?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ehm yes he does
@sonney2k	He should do the final pass checking for language problems
 blackburn	well I rewrote much things
 blackburn	in last days
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll try to do my best with language :(
 blackburn	I try
@sonney2k	don't worry - the paper won't be rejected because of that
@sonney2k	(if you let chris do one final pass)
 blackburn	sonney2k: there are a lot of chris' sentences
 blackburn	abstract was written by him, but reworked by me
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about address?
@sonney2k	it should be an address you can be reached under
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm afraid I can't be reached with my institution address, what should I do?
 blackburn	no idea how students can be reached with their instituion..
@sonney2k	keep it
@sonney2k	in the end no one will ever write you to your postal address
@sonney2k	just keep the email addr current
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	I registered better email :D
 blackburn	blackburn91@gmail.com is not too serious haha
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok thanks
@sonney2k	I hope you can help with the gsoc ideas list
@sonney2k	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html
@sonney2k	this one is what we have to update
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure, but can we do it not this week?
@sonney2k	when?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have last exam on 23..
 blackburn	week would be enough
 blackburn	so to the end of january
 blackburn	is it ok for you?
@sonney2k	I will talk to my ex-colleagues at TU if they want to help / work on this or not
 blackburn	sonney2k: I could virtually take 2-3 students with not very complicated tasks
@sonney2k	I can only do 1
 blackburn	sonney2k: then take 2-3 and I will be helping you
@sonney2k	I will probably be on paternal leave again and have a few weeks of holidays this time
@sonney2k	well first we have to see if someone is interested in co-mentoring
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will be available almost fully in july and august
@sonney2k	then we have to apply again
 blackburn	fully free
@sonney2k	and then we will see if we will be accepted
 blackburn	yeah sure
@sonney2k	and then we can discuss how many students we can really effort to take
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think I should show carol my paper once it is published hah
 blackburn	nice adv for shogun as gsoc org
@sonney2k	I really hope you manage to get this published.
@sonney2k	and no, it doesn't help that I initiated that jmlr-mloss track
@sonney2k	the barrier is defined by the reviewers and action editor you get
 blackburn	well yes, I meant you know much what is good for this track
 blackburn	I did not mean you can help
@sonney2k	it is a moving target... and I haven't been active for a while now
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you be active with researches in next years?
@sonney2k	unclear
 blackburn	do you do any research at job?
@sonney2k	no public research at least
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm not the worst russian english writer : http://www.waset.org/journals/waset/v13/v13-13.pdf

 kate__	anybody here?
 kate__	blackburn?
 blackburn	kate__: yes
 kate__	hello
 kate__	remember me?
 blackburn	kate__: haha sure
 kate__	had a swig problem
 kate__	ok
 kate__	lets say i have linux
 kate__	whould it be easier to do an example?
 blackburn	kate__: would be easier to install shogun
@sonney2k	kate__, btw I managed to get shogun to work under cygwin - but I had to manually install swig 2.0.4 for that... (as in compile from source and install dependencies)
 shogun-buildbot	build #266 of python_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/266
@sonney2k	but linux is the easier option :)
@sonney2k	all hail the autobuild :)
 kate__	@sonney2k i tried to install manually swig 2.0.1  but i couldn't
 blackburn	2.0.1 will not fit
 blackburn	I thought so but not
 kate__	ok but 2.0.4 didn't have an .exe file and no instrunctions
@sonney2k	kate__, download the .tar.gz. from source
 kate__	sorry sonney2k but i m gonna need some more info on that
 kate__	the what now?
 blackburn	kate__: http://www.swig.org/download.html
 blackburn	download swigwin-2.0.4
@sonney2k	no - don't download swigwin
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	just the normal swig-2.0.4.tar.gz
 blackburn	ok download normal one
@sonney2k	IIRC one has to install pcre or so in cygwin
@sonney2k	then compile/install swig
@sonney2k	and then shogun again
@sonney2k	and then finally make install DESTDIR=
@sonney2k	anyways - I have to sleep now
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	left me alone :(
 blackburn	kate__: okay lets start with downloading
 blackburn	kate__: I am afraid I will have to go sleep in 30-40 mins too
 kate__	ok
 kate__	lets do this quick
 kate__	write me the steps
 kate__	will you be on tomorrow morning if something goes wrong?
 blackburn	kate__: just download it now, I'm not going to sleep just now :)
 kate__	ok
 kate__	question
 kate__	i download swig 2.0.4 right?
 blackburn	kate__: yes, not swigwin
 kate__	ok
 kate__	done
 blackburn	kate__: then install pcre package and remove swig in your cygwin setup
 kate__	ok
 kate__	done
 blackburn	kate__: unpack swig tar to some dir
 blackburn	then ./configure
 kate__	no directory found
 blackburn	./configure in unpacked swig dir
 kate__	aahhhh
 blackburn	just like it is done with shogun
 blackburn	brb

 kate__	ok,i m doing something wrong with the command, sorry but i m tired from the trip last night and my brain doesn't connect properly, lets say that the swig file is at the desktop under the name swig what do i do?
 blackburn	kate__: no, there will be no file
 blackburn	ok I'll describe what you should do
 kate__	ok
 blackburn	you have to run ./configure in unpacked swig dir
 blackburn	then once it is done right
 blackburn	(if something goes wrong it will say it lacks some package - just install it)
 blackburn	do make and make install
 blackburn	but I am afraid you have to specify install dir
 kate__	ok
 kate__	yes i did
 kate__	its running
 kate__	for some reason it doesnt read pcre
 kate__	checking for pcre-config... no configure: error:         Can't find pcre-config script from PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Express              ions)         library package. This dependency is needed for configure to complete,         Either:
 kate__	i installed it...i really did
 blackburn	I guess you have to install everything related to pcre
 blackburn	pcre dev or so
 kate__	it has some libs
 blackburn	libpcre may be I don't remember exactly
 blackburn	just install everything found with 'pcre'

 kate__	yes
 kate__	./configure --interfaces=python_modular

 blackburn	kate__: no you have to make swig
 kate__	ok
 kate__	done
 blackburn	make install
 kate__	ok
 blackburn	done?
 kate__	almost i believe
 kate__	but say the rest
 blackburn	once it is done cd to shogun and make it
 kate__	so you can go to sleep
