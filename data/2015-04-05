@besser82	lisitsyn, nice ^^
@besser82	lisitsyn, could you please update my gh-perms for shogun?
@besser82	lisitsyn, collab ---> owner?
@besser82	lisitsyn, since all you guys are owners, but me  ;(
@lisitsyn	ok added
@besser82	lisitsyn, many thanks :D
@lisitsyn	some permission was missed? ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, all perms are fine now  :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, many, many thanks...
@lisitsyn	besser82: why? :)
@besser82	lisitsyn, for adding me as owner  :D
@lisitsyn	was that an issue?
@besser82	not really
@lisitsyn	besser82: I just don't get what changed :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, long-dong status, when commenting on PRs  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, previously there was `collaborator` == baby-nuts  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, btw...  shall we merge this one?  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2586
@besser82	lisitsyn, looks fine to me, Travis is fine as well...
@lisitsyn	don't know
@besser82	lisitsyn, It adds a new test, and wouldn't break anything...  merging in :D

@besser82	lisitsyn, building modshogunOCTAVE_wrap.cxx eats RAM like crazy...
@besser82	sigh... :8
@besser82	:(
@besser82	https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/7592/9417592/build.log
@lisitsyn	besser82: yeah they are all like 1M LoC
@lisitsyn	heiko and fernando had some thoughts on that
@besser82	lisitsyn, nope...  Octave is even fsking more...  like da > 4.2 Gbytes  :(
@besser82	lisitsyn, did write anything down about their thoughts?
@besser82	*thay
@lisitsyn	besser82: in wiki
@besser82	*they
@besser82	lisitsyn, ahh... lemme read
@lisitsyn	besser82: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/SWIG-issues
@besser82	lisitsyn, I see...
@besser82	lisitsyn, so we definetively need sth. like "plugin" structure...
@lisitsyn	besser82: probably
 shogun-buildbot	build #273 of trusty - libshogun - viennacl is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/trusty%20-%20libshogun%20-%20viennacl/builds/273
@besser82	lisitsyn, libshogun with proxy-classes
@lisitsyn	yeah some kind of
@lisitsyn	we don't need most of classes
@besser82	lisitsyn, and shared object, that are dlopened from there
@lisitsyn	yes
@besser82	lisitsyn, let me think about and make a draft
 shogun-buildbot	build #274 of trusty - libshogun - viennacl is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/trusty%20-%20libshogun%20-%20viennacl/builds/274  blamelist: Bj?rn Esser <bjoern.esser@gmail.com>
@besser82	lisitsyn, and possibly we need sth. like "depsolving"
@besser82	lisitsyn, when on algo requires another one
@lisitsyn	yeah
@besser82	lisitsyn, so we need some real smart plugin-loader-shiatz
@lisitsyn	this is tricky
@besser82	lisitsyn, I think I can handle this  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, have lot's of ideas in da brains
@besser82	lisitsyn, and since we are the only two guys in core who can do it, you know...
@besser82	lisitsyn, I possibly can mock up a solution soon...
@besser82	lisitsyn, then we need man-power to get it going  :P
@lisitsyn	I had some prototype
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer
@besser82	lisitsyn, lemme check it out...
-!- nszceta [~nszceta@95.211.152.2] has joined #shogun
@besser82	lisitsyn, I possibly have a solution in mind which should be able to handle all stuff inside one proxy class...
@besser82	lisitsyn, and a "hashtable"
@lisitsyn	besser82: you'd need other base classes for methods
@lisitsyn	like train/apply etc
 shogun-buildbot	build #991 of precise - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/precise%20-%20libshogun/builds/991  blamelist: Abinash Panda <abinash.panda.ece10@itbhu.ac.in>
@besser82	lisitsyn, that could be handled within the same class
@lisitsyn	besser82: then in python any shogun object would be a megaproxy that supports anything
@lisitsyn	and only in runtime you can realize that it doesn't support say 'train'
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes probably...
@lisitsyn	if you go really dynamic like resolve method by name in runtime
@lisitsyn	you lose java
@besser82	lisitsyn, do we?
@lisitsyn	I mean in java you can't do that dynamic
@besser82	lisitsyn, I think that can be done inside the c++-part
@besser82	lisitsyn, so Java sees just like one class
@lisitsyn	obj.method("apply").call(parameters)
 shogun-buildbot	build #2681 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/2681  blamelist: Abinash Panda <abinash.panda.ece10@itbhu.ac.in>
@lisitsyn	I can imagine that but looks ugly
@besser82	lisitsyn, it looks ugly, but is semantic :D
@besser82	lisitsyn, I thought more about:  SGClass my_class = new SGClass("real_class")
@lisitsyn	that's ok but we need interfaces
@besser82	lisitsyn, we can expose that to interfaces, i think
@lisitsyn	we'd need machine etc
@besser82	lisitsyn, that could be resolved inside c++
@besser82	lisitsyn, like with da call-backs to pointers in a map
@besser82	lisitsyn, ugly, but would work

@besser82	lisitsyn, so we'll have a dynamic plugin-loader, which determines avail plugins on startup
@besser82	lisitsyn, plugins can be structured like base, classifier, clustering, evaluation, machine, io, ...
@besser82	lisitsyn, a resolving needed shiatz is done in c++ with calls to ctor-ptrs stored in a map
@lisitsyn	yeah kind of
@besser82	lisitsyn, so instances are created dynamicly in run-time
@besser82	lisitsyn, then we need a proxy base-class for each type of plugin and stuf is done...
@besser82	lisitsyn, that would be my plan at least in "grob"...
@besser82	lisitsyn, so currently that is a mock-up, but I think it can be done pretty easy...
@besser82	lisitsyn, much brain-dead work and there we go
@besser82	lisitsyn, that should slim down e.g. interfaces a lot
@besser82	ok... it adds some overhead in c++, but that shouldn't be the problem

@besser82	since performing operations on data is more time consuming
@besser82	lisitsyn, what do you think?
@besser82	lisitsyn, and when we go down that road we can do real clean-ups in sg
@besser82	lisitsyn, like kicking out all obosolete legacy code for static-interfaces
@besser82	lisitsyn, and replacing some of the datastructures with stl
@besser82	lisitsyn, or most of the datastructures
@besser82	lisitsyn, Who needs SGVECTOR?
@besser82	lisitsyn, That's implemented in C
@besser82	lisitsyn, at least has been...
@besser82	lisitsyn, there is some much which can be cleaned during that transistion
@besser82	lisitsyn, and we can even make the interfaces compiling "standalone" then
@besser82	lisitsyn, standalone == compile somewhen later, if needed, not one monolithic build like now
@lisitsyn	besser82: uh
@lisitsyn	besser82: sorry back
@lisitsyn	besser82: it would be better to describe it somehow and then we all can discuss
@lisitsyn	and decide
