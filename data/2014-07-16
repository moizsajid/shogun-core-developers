 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I've been working on notebook for autoencoders
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: cool, is it going fast?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, that's what I have so far: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/khalednasr/b39fafd092854319869d
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: looks cool!
@lisitsyn	We'll create an autoencoder with following structure: 256->512->128->512->256
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: ^ this one needs some explanation :)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, you mean where numbers come from, or what they mean?
@lisitsyn	I'd say both
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: hmm I think I have one idea how to construct layers
@lisitsyn	let me code it :D
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, what is it? :)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: builder-style thing
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, what do you mean?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: NeuralLayers.input(256).rectified_linear(512).rectified_linear(128).rectified_linear(512).linear(256)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: what do you thikn?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, sounds cool!

@lisitsyn	khalednasr: don't bother with that though as you have a bunch of other things to do :)
@lisitsyn	I'll add this thing
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, cool :)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, about the opencl kernels, any suggestions to make generation more less repetitive?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: well some things like kernel name etc
@lisitsyn	it looks like it could be moved into some abstract thing

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, that might be possible. I'll work on it once I push the PR for the notebook, later tonight
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: what do you think about pushing gpu-related things on top of this branch?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, you mean getting neuralnets on top of the linalg branch?
@lisitsyn	yes
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, sounds good
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, but don't notebooks and webdemos run from the develop branch? if we continue development in another branch, the new stuff won't be available for the notebooks?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: ohh true
