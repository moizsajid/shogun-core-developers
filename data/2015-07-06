 lyko	Hi all - I'm trying to serialize/de-serialize a CC45ClassifierTree object in C++, but when I call load_serializable I'm getting an error:
 lyko	shogun-4.0.0/src/shogun/base/Parameter.cpp line 2249: TParameter::new_sgserial(): Class `CTreeMachineNode' was not listed during compiling Shogun :( ... Can not construct it for `m_root'!
 lyko	This is my first time using Shogun so I was hoping I could get some help from this channel - does anybody know what's going on here? Is this a known issue?
@wiking	mmm
 lyko	Also, I'm looking at the ASCII serialized file, and I don't think the information stored is correct in the first place - the entire structure of the decision tree appears to be missing
 lyko	as least from what I can tell
@wiking	yeah according to the error that's what happens
 lyko	okay so.... this seems like a really basic error. I'm not doing anything complex, just trying to save and load a machine to/from a file. The error makes it sound like proper serialization support doesn't exist at all for CTreeMachines?
