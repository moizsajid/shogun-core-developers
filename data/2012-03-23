 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r252a844 / (4 files in 3 dirs):
 CIA-64	shogun: remove blas/lapack functions from Math headers
 CIA-64	shogun: in particula drop dgemm / dgemv which can be directly used from atlas
 CIA-64	shogun: anyways. - http://git.io/NpKy3g
 sonne|work	shogun-buildbot: now buildbot lets see if you will be happy again
 n4nd0	:)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: of course he (or she) is not
 sonne|work	different problem
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha

 blackburn	sonne|work: what's up with lapack test?
 sonne|work	blackburn: atlas was always disabled on buildbot - now that it is enabled it triggers bugs
 blackburn	sonne|work: clapack.h missing h\mm
 blackburn	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/1336edf6a03ae51575f04d6630f87f5b415f2e87 why did you do that?
 blackburn	I mean it was working before
 sonne|work	no it was not working before
 sonne|work	to autodetect atlas
 blackburn	sonne|work: on my ubuntu it was detecting atlas pretty well
 sonne|work	on my machine running debian unstable not / nor on n4nd0's machine
 blackburn	anyway something goes wrong with HAVE_* things I guess
 sonne|work	no
 blackburn	what is wrong then?
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 sonne|work	problem is that INCLUDES need to be used in examples
 blackburn	ah right
 sonne|work	so what we have in .config needs to be propagated to be used in make check-examples
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I don't know if this may help but yesterday when I configure with includes=/usr/include/atlas I got octave to work good
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but this morning I discovered that the examples in libshogun failed
 n4nd0	clapack.h not found IIRC
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yeah - that is what we are working on...
 n4nd0	I had to configure without the flag and compile again
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw as for tests, you probably have seen I've fixed serialization related errors
 blackburn	sonne|work: and yes svmocas test should be 'resaved'
 sonne|work	no - when?
 blackburn	sonne|work: well in the beginning of this week or so
 blackburn	I wrote parameter map stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/eec65f511fd1f33edfe4f58c195d8443a45a03a8 that is
 gsomix	sonne|work, I responded to comments on github
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r26aff14 / src/Makefile.template : propagate INCLUDES to libshogun examples - http://git.io/ZLGYkA
 sonne|work	blackburn: nice - but I think we need to increase parameter version in NEWS too
 sonne|work	i.e. paramter 0 -> parameter 1
 blackburn	sonne|work: exactly
 blackburn	sonne|work: and default version as well
 blackburn	if it wasn't changed before
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r956b5e4 / src/NEWS : increment parameter format version 0 -> 1 - http://git.io/SMlZ1g
 sonne|work	it used to be 0
 blackburn	nevertheless I don't like this soo hard back compatibility stuff but I was surprised how well-designed it is
 blackburn	sonne|work: could you please emphasize in how to apply guide we don't need test commits/comments/requests
 blackburn	2 cases already I don't know how to tell them we don't need it
 sonne|work	blackburn: should this be 1 one at the end SGParamInfo("kernel_backup", CT_SCALAR, ST_NONE, PT_SGOBJECT, 0) ?
 sonne|work	I mean doesn't kernel_backup exist only in version 1?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah my mistake probably
 blackburn	sonne|work: custom kernel as well
 blackburn	data_locked is already 0
 sonne|work	could you please fix it?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can't sorry, I have no access to my notebook right now
 sonne|work	ok done
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r3f877e2 / src/shogun/machine/KernelMachine.cpp : custom_kernel / kernel_backup appeared only in version 1 - http://git.io/jpXaVw
 blackburn	sonne|work: and probably my port 22 is blocked here :D
 blackburn	my? git I mean
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok thanks
 sonne|work	hmmhh still failing
 blackburn	sonne|work: what fails?
 sonne|work	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/576/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
 sonne|work	not sure if this is already the version   with the Makefile.template patch
 sonne|work	yeah it is
 blackburn	sonne|work: where is clapack.h on your machine?
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r0445a57 / examples/undocumented/libshogun/check.sh : let check.sh propagate INCLUDES too - http://git.io/Ru9fSQ
 sonne|work	now it should work...
* sonne|work crosses fingers
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	sonne|work: does rest code like converters etc work?
 blackburn	with new changes I mean
 blackburn	is it only related to examples?
 sonne|work	blackburn: atlas was always off on machines where clapack.h was not in /usr/include/
 sonne|work	so it can only affect libshogun based stuff
 sonne|work	gsomix: I just had a look - nice work. so can this be applied as is?
 sonne|work	gsomix: or do we have to deal with http://www.mail-archive.com/numpy-discussion@scipy.org/msg29403.html somehow?
 shogun-buildbot	build #578 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/578
 sonne|work	yay! :-)
 blackburn	success
 shogun-buildbot	build #556 of r_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_static/builds/556
 blackburn	sonne|work: new crazy idea: we should encourage some ML teaching course to use shogun!
 shogun-buildbot	build #557 of octave_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/557
 sonne|work	blackburn: not a crazy idea - but you know I am not a professor so it is tough...
 sonne|work	so in case you become one (or heiko) -> do it :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I actually can organize something not really official
 blackburn	but that sucks
 blackburn	I mean we could contact some professor
 blackburn	sonne|work: in the crazy case I would like to become a lecturer it would require at least 6 (sic!) years more
 shogun-buildbot	build #545 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/545
 n4nd0	blackburn: sonne|work I think I could be able to talk about it with a professor here at KTH
 blackburn	n4nd0: nice! I am personally ready to support something like that
 blackburn	i.e. with code or so
 n4nd0	blackburn: here they have a couple of courses in the ml master where students use simple examples in matlab to see different learning algorithms work
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that the teacher would probably agree if we suggest the idea and give the examples of the stuff they want of course
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think it's an awesome idea btw
 blackburn	n4nd0: just retrieve a list of topics or so
 blackburn	and we can develop some pretty examples
 n4nd0	this is the first course, take a look under lab assignments
 n4nd0	http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DD2431/ml11/
 n4nd0	and here you can see the topics of the other course http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DD2427/bik12/Schedule.php
 blackburn	n4nd0: aha will take a look
 gsomix	sonne|work, as is. if i figured out correctly.

 blackburn	sonne|work: huh! that's strange ^
 sonne|work	leaving CSGObject::migrate
 sonne|work	leaving CSGObject::migrate
 sonne|work	*** glibc detected *** python: corrupted double-linked list: 0x0000000000cb23d0 ***
 sonne|work	seems like we have a problem in one of the data structures migrations use...
 blackburn	yeah but it is ok on my pc
 sonne|work	uhh and

 sonne|work	KRR is disabled/unavailable!
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's because you renamed it

@sonney2k	harshit_, the dimensionality of your w vector doesn't match the dim of you examples
@sonney2k	so you call apply and it cannot do anything
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.130.255] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw it is only python_modular that is failing...
@sonney2k	all the rest is ok now?!
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh many tests work now - but I still have these warnings about data_locked not being there
@sonney2k	so I guess something is not working correctly yet...
@sonney2k	yeah and the multiclass issue is still there too
 wiking	blackburn: i have some code
 wiking	i'll commit it but now i'm off to rest a bit
 wiking	when u have time and when it's in would be great to have some feedback
