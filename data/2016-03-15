@HeikoS	any objections?
@HeikoS	a bit cleaner for the cmake option

 curiousguy13	HeikoS, hey
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: hi
 curiousguy13	i wanted to talk to you regarding this : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3071
 curiousguy13	so are we completely removing the NATIVE interface from shogun?
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: yes, we now have eigen3 always enabled
 curiousguy13	ohh, ok
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: but obviously only delete if the function is implemented elsewhere
@HeikoS	and if not, port it to eigen3
 curiousguy13	ok, so range fill is implemented as part of the SGVector class

 curiousguy13	so, I should just port my NATIVE implementation to Eigen3
 curiousguy13	?

@HeikoS	curiousguy13: no first check whether that is necessary
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: if there is no such case, just remove the native
 curiousguy13	okay
 curiousguy13	so, if we add a new method to linalg like cholesky we need to add it's eigen3 implemetation, right?
 curiousguy13	HeikoS, ^
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: yes
@HeikoS	see  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3074
 curiousguy13	HeikoS, nice. I'll give this one a shot.
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: yes this will be really really useful
 curiousguy13	HeikoS, I am interested in the shogun-detox GSoC project btw.
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: make sure to send small patches
@HeikoS	and aim for high unit test coverage
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: cool good to hear
@HeikoS	curiousguy13: you are the second person to be interested in it iirc

@HeikoS	just push to web2?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet
 lisitsyn	but soon
@HeikoS	okok
@HeikoS	looking forward
@HeikoS	the time out is caused by shogun-unit-test
 lisitsyn	meh that sucks
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
@HeikoS	just managed to get this locally
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: any idea what happened?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no idea
@HeikoS	it just doesnt terminate
@HeikoS	Ill check recently added unit tests
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: can you reproducei t?
 lisitsyn	lets use gdb
@HeikoS	probably some joker did an infinite loop that only appears random
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I compiled with -DENABLE_TESTING=On and everything else default
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just run it and attach gdb
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I leave that to you :)
 lisitsyn	meeeh
 lisitsyn	ok let me try
@HeikoS	Ill update the cookbook style
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah actually
 lisitsyn	I tried read the docs theme

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah
@HeikoS	ok then I wont do it in that case
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and also leave it to you
@HeikoS	as you already started ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it was in 2015 I think
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	will try again now
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah just try and lets see
 lisitsyn	I bet tabs would look ugly
 lisitsyn	but we can try to repair it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it looks nice
@HeikoS	but it doesnt work :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok
 lisitsyn	should be possible to repair
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: can you do a branch so I fix it?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sure, but travis wont build it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so not sure a branch makes sense
@HeikoS	I think better do locally

@HeikoS	wiking: btw when I said remove doxygen docs, I meant everything but the class list.
@HeikoS	wiking: did we talk about the same thing?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: any results regarding the style thing?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I'm working ;)
 sanuj	HeikoS: hi
 sanuj	HeikoS: dunno what to do about the buildbot freezing due to knn. doesn't happen on my laptop.
@wiking	HeikoS: btw i'm just checkoing
@wiking	that thing has been broken
@wiking	for a while :D
 shogun-buildbot	build #605 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/605  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Saurabh7 <saurabh.mahindre@gmail.com>
@wiking	i guess there was again
@wiking	a none backward compatibility change
@wiking	in the mds
@wiking	man we cannot scale like this
@wiking	that every time there's an unilateral change
@wiking	and somebody else have to clear up the mess
@HeikoS	sanuj: its not knn
@HeikoS	sanuj: its the unit test that freezes
@HeikoS	wiking: details?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do you know about shogun's group lasso solver?
@wiking	HeikoS: details: 1) doxygen changing from one dir to another 2) md changes 3) adding ply and other dependencies
@wiking	if you do these things
@wiking	you do all the way to the end
@wiking	fixing buildbot
@wiking	fixing doxygen generation
@wiking	etc.
@wiking	if you cannot
@HeikoS	wiking: I wish I could
@wiking	then before merging
@wiking	you take care
@HeikoS	but I dont have buildbot access
@wiking	of communicating
@wiking	and not merge
@wiking	and then wait others to fix it
@wiking	and pls
@wiking	when you squash a commit
@wiking	do not
@wiking	ever put there your commit history
@wiking	try to come up with a real commit history log
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I do
@HeikoS	wiking: will avoid next time, thanks
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: why?
@HeikoS	wiking: the thing with the merges is that nothing ever moves if I wait for poeple to react
@wiking	yes
@wiking	i dont think i dont react
@wiking	in a reasonable time
@HeikoS	wiking: but how can I help now with the fix?
@wiking	dunnno beacuse i have no idea
@wiking	how this got broken
@wiking	and it's not only because
@wiking	cookbook changes
@HeikoS	wiking: the md change was long time ago
@HeikoS	dont think it was broken since then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I need a group lasso
-!- mizari [~mizari@isc.tsu.ru] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can I just give it objective function that I implement myself?
@HeikoS	and then define groups in variable?
@HeikoS	or do I need to give it in matrix form?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you'd need to define groups as objects
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_featureblock_logistic_regression.py
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the thing is I have an objective that I want to avoid formulating it as a matrix thing
-!- mizari [~mizari@isc.tsu.ru] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: our solver is heavily specialized
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this is logistic regression
@HeikoS	I just want squared loss
@HeikoS	i.e. regression
@HeikoS	but it is not quite regression
@HeikoS	I have my own objective
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/slep/slep_mc_plain_lr.cpp
 lisitsyn	that's where it is implemented
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so it has to be matrix form
@HeikoS	gna
@HeikoS	pitty
@HeikoS	my matrix is sparse
@HeikoS	dont want to store it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it uses dense_dot_range
@HeikoS	in the form of features
 lisitsyn	dot features
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah so I can overload
 lisitsyn	I think so
@HeikoS	cool that helped
@HeikoS	will have a look
@HeikoS	wiking: it is LaRank unit test
@HeikoS	that freezes
@HeikoS	at least locally on my machine
 sanuj	HeikoS: LaRank freezes on my machine also sometimes
 sanuj	HeikoS: i'm using sinc for krr cookbook page
@HeikoS	sanuj: thats fine, how big is training and test data? are there test labels?
@HeikoS	or are you adding a new?
 sanuj	HeikoS: no i added in the previous update only
 sanuj	HeikoS: training has 100 samples and testing has 10

@wiking	(centos has 2.8.11)
@wiking	but we require

@wiking	backward compatibility
@wiking	is the mantra
@HeikoS	yeah I get it

@HeikoS	but how should I know before man?
@HeikoS	stop pretending that I dont care about this
@wiking	you check
@wiking	you dont care enough
@wiking	you should check it
@HeikoS	for 15 OS?
@wiking	no
@wiking	for cmake version
@HeikoS	what do we have buildbot for?
@wiking	you know that we require
@wiking	2.8.8
@HeikoS	for this
@wiking	it's in the cmake
@HeikoS	so I let the bot check and then fix
@wiking	no
@wiking	this is bullshit driven development
@wiking	soryr but this is the truth
@HeikoS	tsss
@wiking	the cmake requested version
@wiking	is in the cmakefile
@wiking	if you take a function
@wiking	then check prior adding
@wiking	i did this
@wiking	for all the Find*bullshit.cmake
@wiking	that's why we have those there
@wiking	a lot of them available in 3.x
@HeikoS	point here is: it seems there
@HeikoS	but has changed API
@HeikoS	anyways I will fix it
@wiking	thnx
@wiking	maybe
@wiking	you should try using this

 sanuj	HeikoS: haha, sure
 sanuj	HeikoS: proper citation from now :)
 arasu	Hello everyone. I'm submitting a GSoC proposal for Shogun and we've been asked to introduce ourselves on the IRC.... which to be honest, is quite cryptic to me.
 arasu	Anyways, I'm Arasu, a 2nd year UG student from IIT Hyderabad, in India.
 arasu	I'd like to try out for the Hip Deep Learning project.
 sanuj	HeikoS: that bibtex was autogenerated by google scholar
@HeikoS	sanuj: yes and its crap ;)
@HeikoS	arasu: nice to meet you
@HeikoS	looking forward to your tonributions
 sanuj	HeikoS: :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: google rarely produces good bibtex entries
 arasu	I'm the guy who embarrassed himself by not reading the first paragraph of the "GSoC guidelines" on Shogun's page :P
 arasu	Regarding my work, I've made a few PRs regarding some stochastic optimizers
@HeikoS	arasu: that is fine ... there are loads of you ;)
@HeikoS	arasu: I see so that is you
@HeikoS	arasu: try to ping lisitsyn about them
@HeikoS	or yorkerlin
 arasu	and I've made some layers (Tanh, HardTanh) which are almost done. And a few constructors and typo fixes which were pushed.
 arasu	Yup, I did. I mailed him to remind him.
 arasu	Although it's probably very hectic for him now anyways.
 sanuj	HeikoS: not sure what to cite for krr
 sanuj	so i'm leaving this for now
 sanuj	and making a pr
@HeikoS	sanuj: the david barber book has a cahpter on this fot sure
@HeikoS	arasu: please dont write private emails
@HeikoS	but ping in chat
@HeikoS	wiking: anything to complain here? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3077
 lisitsyn	hey arasu
 arasu	Yes, I realized my mistake. I didn't know how exactly to remind him, that was all.
 lisitsyn	I've seen your mail no worries
 arasu	Coincidentally, I replied back to that just 20 seconds ago.

 arasu	I had a doubt regarding the Hip Deep Learning project that I wanted to discuss with you guys about.
 sanuj	HeikoS: the book is loading, will check it out
 arasu	What is Shogun's future plan regarding Deep Learning?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb4%20-%20python3/builds/762/steps/configure/logs/stdio
@HeikoS	Ill leave this one for you
@HeikoS	arasu: get all the basic algorithms in, and them make them run fast
 lisitsyn	yeah ^
 arasu	Yes, one of my proposals is to refactor the code and the unit tests with linalg and OpenMP.
@HeikoS	arasu: shogun will never be the state of the art deep learning platform, but it will contain competitive implementations of all standard algos
@HeikoS	that is a good idea
@HeikoS	especially parallelising
@HeikoS	but more importantly we want things to run on graphic cards
@HeikoS	much more gains than for multicore
 sanuj	HeikoS: are we going to continue using viennacl?
 arasu	ViennaCL takes care of the GPU support, right? It was clarified to me on an issue discussion.
@HeikoS	sanuj: I guess so
 arasu	By sanuj
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ^
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool
 arasu	By extending to other algorithms, I'm in a dilemma of proposing between
 arasu	RNNs and LSTMs versus DBNs, DBMs
 lisitsyn	I am fancy of having recurrent networks as well
@HeikoS	wiking: are the infra script automatically updated on buildbot ?
 arasu	Contemporary work is most on the former. RNNs are very hot topics these days.
 sanuj	HeikoS: leaving now, will send the PR soon

@HeikoS	sanuj: nice looking forward

@wiking	HeikoS: it's installed
@wiking	as i said previously
@wiking	the detection of it
@wiking	is not good
@wiking	or not complete
@HeikoS	wiking: ah sorry didnt get that
@wiking	same goes for ctags
 arasu	considering hip deep learning was a non-priority project already, i wasn't sure about my freedom of choice in proposal.
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ^
@HeikoS	wiking: how would you try to find python modules in cmake?
@wiking	dunno
@wiking	try github
 lisitsyn	arasu: ah no worries, if you have some suggestions we're pretty much open
@wiking	to see for examples

 Bestony	i do some frontend and php in free time .
 Bestony	i know that Shogun need student for documenting.Maybe i am not  clever for Shogun.
@HeikoS	Bestony: Shogun is c++
@HeikoS	and this year in particular, we want to do software eingineering

@wiking	HeikoS: mmm how did you end up changing compiler flags?
@HeikoS	wiking: if I do this, does it overwrite things in other places?
@HeikoS	SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${GENERATED_CPP_BINARY} PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-Wno-unused-variable")
@HeikoS	I do this for the cpp meta examples, as they have unused variables
@wiking	:>
@wiking	where did u do it?
@wiking	which cmakefile?
@wiking	but yeah i suppose
@wiking	as b4 that
@wiking	there wasn't a problem
@HeikoS	it is the tester though
@HeikoS	ADD_EXECUTABLE(meta_example_integration_tester ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tester.cpp)
@HeikoS	ADD_DEPENDENCIES(meta_example_integration_tester shogun)
@HeikoS	target_link_libraries(meta_example_integration_tester shogun ${SANITIZER_LIBRARY})
@HeikoS	should I add this here:
@HeikoS	IF(SANITIZER_FLAGS)
@HeikoS	set_target_properties(meta_example_integration_tester PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS ${SANITIZER_FLAGS})
@HeikoS	ENDIF()
@HeikoS	have the feeling that is it
@HeikoS	it is done to the libshogun examples
@HeikoS	and the tester is same kind of thing
@wiking	which cmake file
@wiking	exactly
@wiking	are we talking about
@wiking	where u do this
@HeikoS	two
@HeikoS	but the last one is
@HeikoS	tests/meta
@HeikoS	line 22
@HeikoS	where I build the c++ program that compares two dumped outputs
@HeikoS	this is where something might be missing
@HeikoS	and the other file is: examples/meta/cpp/CMakeLists.txt
@HeikoS	there I surpress the unused variable warnings, but I think that should not override other things
@wiking	two
@wiking	?
@wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	two?
@HeikoS	I think first file is the reason
@wiking	the sanitizers
@wiking	are compiling
@wiking	tests
@HeikoS	the integration tester program is very much like a libshogun text
@HeikoS	that is c++ example that performs shogun code

@lambday	sanuj: okay.. so let's do the native removal first
 sanuj	lambday: okay, i have worked with linalg before....almost a year back, so i have forgotten most of the stuff
@lambday	I was also thinking of using a better notation for rowwise and colwise things that we have.. I'll add a couple of issues regarding that later :)
@lambday	haha don't worry.. I myself forgot almost all of it
 sanuj	lambday: cool :)
@lambday	sanuj: get your hands dirty with viennacl also...
 sanuj	lambday: shall i get rid of the native implementation and the backend as well?
@lambday	we need some gpu stuffs
 sanuj	lambday: building viennacl with shogun is tricky... i was having some problems which i don't remember anymore :P
@lambday	sanuj: yeah that would make sense.. but I'd suggest you send a small patch first.. remove native for one particular operation.. make sure that the tests still work..
@lambday	sanuj: cmake just have to find your opencl and viennacl shared libraries.. shouldn't be too hard :)
@lambday	anyway it would be worth investing a couple of hours for.. cause we need to make this work :)
 sanuj	lambday: sure, i'll start with the most easy one - add.h
@lambday	sounds cool
@lambday	let's do this iteratively
 sanuj	lambday: agreed
@lambday	when all of NATIVEs are gone, we'll kill the backend
 sanuj	sounds cool
@HeikoS	wiking: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/600/steps/compile/logs/stdio
@HeikoS	this is what I got with the sanitizer thing
@HeikoS	mmmh
@HeikoS	ah wait
@HeikoS	thats different now
@HeikoS	so gotta change it for the cpp as well
@HeikoS	sanuj: jojo
@HeikoS	lambday: jo
@lambday	HeikoS: hola
@HeikoS	lambday: how are thingz?
 sanuj	HeikoS: hey
@lambday	HeikoS: good.. redesigned the hell out of it :/ this is what I have so far https://github.com/lambday/flash/blob/develop/src/flash/statistics/MMD.cpp#L54
@wiking	HeikoS: there are 2 sanitizers ;)
@wiking	just for the record
@HeikoS	wiking: ok thanks
@HeikoS	had no idea about any of this tbh ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: cool checking
@lambday	HeikoS: so the idea is - for each burst, we precompute the kernels on each block - then send each precomputed kernel to a separate thread (either cpu or gpu)
@lambday	they do their job.. when they are done, we get the statistic
@lambday	if we can't allocate enough memory for all the blocks in the burst, we remind the user to use small number of blocks per burst
@lambday	this is still WIP.. other cases have to be added
@HeikoS	lambday: I think this is pretty neat
@HeikoS	especially since it automatically send things to other thread
@lambday	yeah the computation manager takes care of that
@lambday	cm.use_gpu().compute(....)
@lambday	or cpu
@lambday	plus this approach separate the equation itself from the computation.. the equation is same for all the mmds
@lambday	so they are kept separate
@lambday	they are just functors
@lambday	q-time, b-test, linear time - all will use this
@lambday	for q-time, the block is the whole data set
@lambday	for b-test, we ask the user about the blocksize and for linear, we set it to 2/3
@lambday	or so

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: sanitize meta cpp examples if needed
@HeikoS	lambday:  and then each of these seperate things can also do things in parallel if we cant
@lambday	each thread has its own copy - so they can run in parallel
@HeikoS	and yes computation separated from equation is good
@HeikoS	since yes, computation is always the same structure

@HeikoS	lambday: I think for the one sample test, the story will be the same
 sanuj	lambday: removed native implementation and related unittests in add.h
 sanuj	lambday: everything passing
@lambday	yeah the code would look pretty similar for all the cases - easier to read
@lambday	sanuj: awesome! send the patch
 sanuj	lambday: BTW it was me who wrote these native implementations :P
 sanuj	last year
 sanuj	yeah
@lambday	sanuj: haha that's ironic :D
@lambday	HeikoS: I totally screwed up the code last time I can see.. I myself can't understand how things are working/where the pieces are..
@lambday	it's good that I am spending time on it to fix it
@lambday	:(
@HeikoS	hehe
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	yes definitely
@HeikoS	lambday: what is really important is also to actually test things from a statistical qualitative perspective in notebooks later
@HeikoS	check that results make sense
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah that would be the exciting part.. all of this is just plain coding

@HeikoS	lambday: how much longer do you think this will take
@lambday	once I finish this, next step would be to write examples for cookbook and make the notebook work again..
@HeikoS	until we can start writing API examples and tick boxes of which methods/papers we can do
@HeikoS	lambday: but it needs to be integrated with a feature branch as well -- doesnt that take time?
@HeikoS	lambday: document interfaces etc?
@HeikoS	on the other hand we can reuse old docs
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah that too is gonna take time.. but if the code is there, I can reuse old docs and do it parallely..

@lambday	HeikoS: okay I'll do that.. by the end of this week I'll put this thing in a feature branch.. so next week I can give to write the examples.. and some actual testing.. alongwith debugging
@lambday	sanuj: I'm waiting for travis.. you can send more PRs :D
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, maybe even start putting things now. As soon as the quadratic time MMD works, you can put it in :)
@HeikoS	its doesnt have to be perfect in feature branch
@lambday	HeikoS: okay..
 sanuj	lambday: one implementation per PR?
@HeikoS	just compile and then I can already start trying things out.... in case something needs change, we save ourselves a bit of effort
@lambday	oh one question - for quadratic time mmd, we need api for the variance under null and alternative both right?
@lambday	or just the null is fine?
@HeikoS	lambday: both would be good
@HeikoS	but alternative is just variance of the mmd samples itself right?
@HeikoS	lambday: the core interface doesnt need alt, since we dont need it for the test
@HeikoS	but it would be good to have access to this for experimenting
@HeikoS	lambday: I like your gpu switch :)
@lambday	HeikoS: haha need some time to actually implement the opencl kernel :D
@HeikoS	lambday: how much faster was summing all elements of kernel matrix on gpu?
@HeikoS	lambday: linalg should do it no?
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah but linalg is again a mess.. it doesn't have block-wise matrix sum using viennacl
@HeikoS	wiking: whoooo http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/604
@lambday	should be faster
@HeikoS	lambday: then that shold be added I guess
@lambday	that's what I need to check
@HeikoS	lambday: for quadratic time mmd, this is not needed
@lambday	nah
@HeikoS	and there the speedups are most crucial
@HeikoS	lambday: I think we might have to re-write one of the paper statements, which is "permutation test is slow"
@lambday	but for b-test and linear-time this can make significant difference
@HeikoS	this was only because of their crappy implementation
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah ok then
@lambday	HeikoS: another question
@lambday	HeikoS: so what we do for single kernel is --> compute all kernel matrices for a bunch of blocks --> send them to the compute engine to execute parallely
@lambday	for multiple kernels, this way won't work
@lambday	so I was thinking to invoke the parallelism per kernel
@lambday	but that depends - how many kernels do we use for kernel selection?
@lambday	I am just trying to get an idea - where to put the parallelism

@lambday	sanuj: you can send a PR for a bunch of them.. just make sure it's not too large
@HeikoS	I see
 sanuj	lambday: sure
@HeikoS	lambday: so the costs are m^2 for m kernels
@HeikoS	that is the MMD has to be computed (and stored) that many times

 shogun-buildbot	Hey! build clang34 - thread analysis #604 is complete: Warnings [warnings test]
 shogun-buildbot	Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/604
 shogun-buildbot	build #605 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@lambday	I mean, say, if we have 10 kernels and 1000 blocks per burst - all of these kernels AND all of these blocks can be computed parallely.. but to make things simple, I want to use parallel computation (a) either per *kernel* or (b) per block..
@HeikoS	lambday: I see what you mean
@lambday	for single kernel, it's always *per* block
@lambday	1000 threads running in parallel
@HeikoS	usually I think there are more blocks than kernels right?
@lambday	that's what I think - so it makes sense to invoke the parallelism block-wise, rather than kernel-wise
@HeikoS	lambday: yes absolutely
@HeikoS	as long as the cpu is busy that is fine
@lambday	for multiple kernel, we internally reduce the number of blocks we are processing per burst..
@HeikoS	yes
@lambday	okay
@wiking	lambday: how do distribute it?
@lambday	wiking: yeah that's the question
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	but within machine
@wiking	or among machines?
@lambday	wiking: as of now, say, gpu
@lambday	wiking: but maybe hadoop job later
@lambday	:D
@wiking	ok
@wiking	easy
@wiking	http://actor-framework.org/
@lambday	wiking: this is cool stuff
@wiking	yep
@wiking	atm i'm writing my simple example
@wiking	caf + libhdfs
@wiking	and then adding shogun later
@lambday	sexy
@lambday	okay I am definitely trying this - once the basic things work..
@wiking	i'd like this to be the distributed backend of shogun
@lambday	wiking: how is it different from spark?
@wiking	well spark is first of all jvm
@wiking	and spark is an abstraction over akka
@wiking	which is a jvm actor framework
@wiking	so yeah
@wiking	this is c++ actor framework
@lambday	have to check it out
 shogun-buildbot	Hey! build clang34 - thread analysis #605 is complete: Warnings [warnings test]
 shogun-buildbot	Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/605
@HeikoS	lambday: no hadoop or multi machine please :)
@HeikoS	thats a second step
@HeikoS	first is to make it actually work at all, then multicore, then maybe (if the science requests it) we can distribute it
@HeikoS	for now, there is not need for that
@HeikoS	lambday: woul dbe more interesting for other things
 lisitsyn	I heard hadoop
@HeikoS	the ozone one was nice to distribute
@HeikoS	lambday: no
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: your ears tricked you
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah none now :)
@lambday	HeikoS: just the single machine gpu would be nice
@HeikoS	lambday: yeaj
@HeikoS	and multicore
@HeikoS	I canm always get a machine with 100 cores and a few GB of ram if we need power
@HeikoS	a good multicore implementation is quite useful for such things already
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'clang34 - undefined behaviour analysis'
 shogun-buildbot	build #695 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. maybe I'll have to tune it a bit later.. but not thinking of such things as of now..
@HeikoS	lambday: Im keen to write API examples
@HeikoS	lambday: so let me know when I can start with one
@lambday	HeikoS: okay by the end of this week this would be API example ready
@lambday	at least the mmds
@lambday	I'll feature branch it
@HeikoS	lambday: great
@HeikoS	let me know!
 shogun-buildbot	Hey! build clang34 - undefined behaviour analysis #695 is complete: Warnings [warnings test]
 shogun-buildbot	Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20undefined%20behaviour%20analysis/builds/695
@HeikoS	lambday: going home now
@HeikoS	lambday: see you later!
 sanuj	lambday: getting error in this
@lambday	HeikoS: okay see you :)
@HeikoS	wiking: the clang analysis now are compiling again
 sanuj	lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/d8eb73dd89f47e0da28f07163c4f635b96d0ec00/src/shogun/kernel/ExponentialARDKernel.cpp#L95
@HeikoS	wiking: all thats missing is lisitsyn for the ctags fix and me the python3 ply fix
@lambday	HeikoS: for element-wise, we need NATIVE :(
@lambday	sanuj:
 sanuj	lambday: after removing native from Elementwiseunaryoperation.h
@lambday	sanuj: this lambda expression won't be supported by eigen3 or anything else.. only native can support thta
 sanuj	lambday: HeikoS ohoh
@lambday	sanuj: eigen3 has only a few NATIVE element-wise things
 sanuj	lambday: i see
@lambday	sanuj: you can do one thing - remove the specialization.. make it the default
@lambday	oh but then too I am afraid it won't work
 sanuj	lambday: then how will we get rid of native backend
@lambday	let me think
 sanuj	HeikoS: there?

 sanuj	lambday: i'll leave elementwise op for now
 sanuj	and remove other implementations
@lambday	sanuj: for these elementwise things, eigen3 is slow from our perspective... suppose you do an element-wise sin, it returns the result in a newly created matrix..
@lambday	there is a lot of copying involed..
@lambday	yeah that might be better idea for now
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lambday: i don't think there is any harm in keeping native implementations wherever we need them

 sanuj	lambday: this is the last one
 sanuj	lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3081
 sanuj	lambday: now there is native implementatino left in ElementwiseOperations.h, ElementwiseUnaryOperation.h and sin.h
 sanuj	which we are not going to remove i guess
