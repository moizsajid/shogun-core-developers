 blackburn	serialhex: hadn't been here for a long!
 serialhex	yeah i know blackburn, my computer flipped out on me and i've been trying to fix it
 blackburn	serialhex: Soeren got a new baby :)
 serialhex	every so often the windows refuse to redraw unless i _manually_ move them or something!
 serialhex	nice!!  is s/he healthy?
 blackburn	I think so, his name is Jan
 serialhex	cool
* serialhex must congratulate sonney2k when i see him next
 serialhex	i'm currently setting up a backup system - a laptop wth a broken lcd & slow processor - so if shit wants to be all funky i have something i can work on (in a console only, but still...)
 blackburn	I have one notebook with broken screen :)
 blackburn	he became RAM donor for my new notebook :D
 serialhex	sweet!
 serialhex	yeah, this is a celeron m with 512 meg ram i think... it's pretty crappy, but it'll run a console session just fine (even through ssh) but it'll take FOR FUCKING EVAR to compile stuff!
 serialhex	...in fact, trying to run 2 ssh sessions (root & user) is being slow :P
 blackburn	err, such a crap :D
 blackburn	damn ARMA models! AEGHEFW
 alesis-novik	blackburn, ARMA models are fun
 blackburn	alesis-novik: oh, may be you could help me?
 alesis-novik	with?
 blackburn	look, why it could be possible that ARMA(2,3) is better than ARMA(3,3)?
 blackburn	why ARMA(3,3) didn't become ARMA(2,3)?
 alesis-novik	Depends, are we talking about training or specifying the model?
 blackburn	training. if we find models, why it could be possible?
 blackburn	I mean if we are finding best models
 blackburn	why ARMA(3,3) not have one zero coef. for AR what makes it ARMA(2,3)
 blackburn	alesis-novik: do you see a 'paradox'?
 alesis-novik	Ah, what do you mean by better?
 blackburn	alesis-novik: eh. yeah, forgot to tell you what I mean
 blackburn	I meant less deviation from sample covariation
 blackburn	alesis-novik: 'better' is more similar covariation of both model and sample
 blackburn	sorry for curvy language I'm getting afraid when talking about math :D
 alesis-novik	so we train models on the sample and the question is why can ARMA(2, 3) be better than ARMA(3, 3) for the same sample?
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	alesis-novik: ARMA(2,3) is just a special case of ARMA(3,3), right?
 alesis-novik	I'd say both of them are just different ARMA(p, q) models
 alesis-novik	and it doesn't really make sense for ARMA(3, 3) to perform worse on *training* data than ARMA(2, 3), if we do train the models
 blackburn	alesis-novik: yeah, I'd say they are different but my prof. don't agree :)
 alesis-novik	what do they say?
 blackburn	only one zero coef. get ARMA(3,3)  to ARMA(3,2)
 alesis-novik	that's true
 blackburn	alesis-novik: I was asked by my lecturer
 blackburn	with that question, why it could be better
 blackburn	I think the answer is somewhere around word 'better'
 alesis-novik	Well, I'd say the problem is the same as with most things in ML: more parameters - better training fit - might lead to overfitting the data
 blackburn	yeah but he said the answer isn't in ML or econometrics field
 blackburn	I'm really stucked with it :)
 alesis-novik	you could always go for the silly, yet obvious answer: if the data was generated by an ARMA(2, 3) process, then it will be a better fit :D
 blackburn	exactly, but the answer should contain not data reasoning like that
 blackburn	anyway, thank you :)
 blackburn	how are your exams?
 alesis-novik	4 out of 8 done, next one on Monday
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	good luck to you
 blackburn	3-42 here and I'm a bit tired :)
 blackburn	see you

* sonney2k takes a deep breath
@sonney2k	Blackburn, thanks for your help!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have done nothing :)
@bettyboo	:^)
 blackburn	sonney2k: how are you?
 blackburn	the only thing - some guy asked example of kernel usage, but he didn't solved his problem yet. anyway I won't answer him now, have to study more now
@sonney2k	We are all fine
 blackburn	nice to hear that
@sonney2k	Little sleep tonight though the baby kept us awake every full hour being hungry :-)
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	Internet connection and mobile reception sucks though in this hospital here.
@sonney2k	And even worse I don't have Shogun on my Android mobile.
 blackburn	why you want to have shogun? :)

 serialhex	sonney2k: you dont have ssh set up?  that what i've done and (hopefully) will eliminate most of my computer woes!  things are 90% set back up so i should be back in action soon!
@sonney2k	serialhex: this phone needs a keyboard. Typing really is not effective.
 serialhex	sonney2k: ahh, i see!  and i really hate those on-screen keyboards too, most of them suck!   so i take it everything is good over there?
@sonney2k	Yes indeed all good.
@sonney2k	Now for some sleep...
