@sonney2k	1 year back it was 40MB
 lisitsyn	so x is inverted
@sonney2k	and w/ shogun 2.1.0 it was ~120-140MB
@sonney2k	(not sure exactly)
@sonney2k	and now we have 250MB
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's too much
@sonney2k	it is
@sonney2k	question is why it is that much

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: coveralls: exclude third_party directory
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: use --coverage flag
@sonney2k	I agree. That is why our compile time went up drastically
@sonney2k	wiking, is it possible to write our release makefile also in CMake?
@wiking	?
@sonney2k	wiking, or where should we put it at least?
@wiking	ah i guess so
@sonney2k	it doesn't make sense to have a release makefile sitting in root
@sonney2k	everyone will try to do make
@wiking	yeah i'll try to do something about that
@wiking	add a new target
@wiking	make dist or something
@wiking	i mean to cmake
@wiking	and then we can throw out the old Makefile
@sonney2k	wiking, so how would it work then? mkdir build ... cmake .. ; make dist etc?
@sonney2k	wiking, not that it does a lot more than make dist
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah something like that
@sonney2k	currently it builds doc too gpg / md5sum and uploads to shogun servers
@sonney2k	wiking, ok then it should die

@sonney2k	wiking, for the release we also need the REMOVE_SVMLIGHT thing fromt he makefile
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: 253Mlibshogun.so.14.0
@sonney2k	for example besser82 cannot include svmlight in debian
@sonney2k	err FC19
@sonney2k	neither I can in debian
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
@sonney2k	that is what I stumbled upon
@sonney2k	and then I wrote that compile all revisions script
@sonney2k	which ran for the last 3 days
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: just confirming it is :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you use gcc or clang?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw do you have access to fatboot.shogun-toolbox already?
@sonney2k	I don't remember if you were online the day we got it
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i think so
@wiking	sonney2k: but i wouldn't run static analyzer under ubuntu anymore
@wiking	sonney2k: it's very seldomly updated...
@wiking	the one available for osx is much better
@wiking	(output and detection wise)
@sonney2k	wiking, for libshogun only right?
@wiking	yeah...
@wiking	so we can have a ubuntu bot in a chroot
@wiking	just to test for ubuntu
@sonney2k	wiking, yes
@sonney2k	wiking, maybe it makes sense to only have it for ubuntu LTS's
@wiking	yeah i guess so
