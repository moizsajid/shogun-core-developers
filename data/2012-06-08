 KMcQuisten	Hello all
 KMcQuisten	I have some questions.  I've been trying to use the new DirectorKernels, but I'm having some trouble.
 KMcQuisten	Anyone awake to give me a hand?
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, well ask... if no one answers maybe tomorrow someone will
 KMcQuisten	Allrighty
 KMcQuisten	I noticed in the example provided, the kernel function is accessing a global variable in order to calculate the kernel function in terms of the indices
 KMcQuisten	This is really horrible coding style, and I was hoping there was a way to acess data for the kernel internally using the init() function and the acessors built in to the kernel object
 KMcQuisten	But when I use get_lhs() to get one of my features, it has no get_feature_vector method since it's returned only as a CFeatures, not the descended class that I instantiated.
@sonney2k	true
 KMcQuisten	So how can I access the data to overload kernel_function?
@sonney2k	that's a limitation of going from type aware to type unaware languages
@sonney2k	only fix is to introduce (in C++) a function that dyn_casts into the right type
@sonney2k	there really is no other way...
 n4nd0	I remember we talked about these functions for doing casts
 KMcQuisten	What are the chances of that getting added in?  It seems like without it the DircetorKernel framework isn't as useful as it could be
 n4nd0	sonney2k: isn't what we did for the labels?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	someone just has to write those...
@sonney2k	we do this in CBinaryLabels etc too
@sonney2k	anyway
* sonney2k Zzzzz....
 KMcQuisten	Ha.  I know it's late over there
 n4nd0	sonney2k: good night then
 n4nd0	KMcQuisten: would you like to add this functionality?
 n4nd0	there is something equivalent for labels already done
 KMcQuisten	n4nd0, how much work would it take to include that sort of thing for feature accessors within kernels and for kernel accessors within SVMs?
 n4nd0	the methods are called obtain_from_generic
 KMcQuisten	I could give it a shot
 KMcQuisten	if I had the example from the labels implementation i could probably figure it out
 n4nd0	yeah, the methods are really short
 KMcQuisten	i'm assuming it's in the definition for Lavbels?
 n4nd0	do you have the code locally?
 KMcQuisten	Yes I do, but I don't have authorization to commit to the repository
 n4nd0	most of us don't have it :)
 KMcQuisten	I"ll see if I can implement it, then we can worry about that, though
 n4nd0	we have a fork in github and do pull requests there
 KMcQuisten	Well yeah, don't want all kinds of pushes walking all over each other
 n4nd0	the method is implemented in the children of CLabels
 n4nd0	C{Binary, Multiclass, Regression}Labels
 KMcQuisten	So i'd have to implement it in all the Cfeatures children i want to use
 KMcQuisten	And similarly if I want to pull kernels from SVMs
 n4nd0	I think so
 n4nd0	I am not totally sure though, let me think about it a moment
 n4nd0	for the info you have written I would say so
 n4nd0	but I suggest that you first implement it for the class you were talking about and try it out
 KMcQuisten	Oh of course
 KMcQuisten	Now, I have pulled down the code previously using git
 KMcQuisten	but I pulled down the master
 KMcQuisten	is there another branch I should pull before I try this
 KMcQuisten	?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	just create a new branch and do your stuff there
 KMcQuisten	Sounds good
 KMcQuisten	if/when I get it working I'll come back here and figure out how to proceed
 n4nd0	I am checking a thing for you first
 KMcQuisten	Ok
 n4nd0	since in labels we implemented this LabelsType class
 n4nd0	that is precisely used in obtain_from_generic
 n4nd0	there is no such a FeaturesType class though
 KMcQuisten	So it would have to be written as well
 n4nd0	I said nothing
 KMcQuisten	?
 n4nd0	that class exists :)
 KMcQuisten	Ah!
 n4nd0	shogun/features/FeatureTypes.h
 KMcQuisten	Ah, yes, with the Enums
 n4nd0	I think that you may use here the EFeatureClass tyep
 n4nd0	type*
 n4nd0	that you can get it using the method get_feature_class() that should be defined for all the features hierarchy
 KMcQuisten	Yes, I do have access to that from cfeatures
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	a btw, if it is not a huge trouble
 n4nd0	mind to do commits that leave the code in compilable state
 n4nd0	the buildbot compiles commit by commit so in that way the proccess goes smooth and faster
 KMcQuisten	Yes.  CI is a good thing
 n4nd0	I am used to small commits and I broke it some times at the beginning :D
 n4nd0	it is not a big deal in any case
 KMcQuisten	I'll only commit to my local branch one I get the thing working
 n4nd0	that's the spirit
 KMcQuisten	My advisor's a stickler for making sure those of us in the group use good version control habits
 n4nd0	that's very very good
 n4nd0	I still cannot believe that they didn't tell me about VC in any of my courses
 KMcQuisten	So i'll branch the code off of the master, make my edits, commit them only to my branch, then come back here and go over how to properly merge them in
 KMcQuisten	Sound like a plan?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	before you start get the final version of the code in the repo
 KMcQuisten	Yes, i'll pull the latest before I start
 n4nd0	in master git pull --rebase upstream master or equivalent
 KMcQuisten	The whole line?  I'm not yet totally familiar with all of git's command line options
 KMcQuisten	NM, I got it
 KMcQuisten	:)
 n4nd0	from master it would be enough just to do
 n4nd0	git pull upstream master
 n4nd0	since you don't normally use master as a branch for development
 n4nd0	but I think it is a good practice to use the rebase so you keep it in your head for the moments when it really does matter
 KMcQuisten	Right
 n4nd0	e.g. when you have working in your branch for some days and want to sync with master before merging
 n4nd0	then it is good that you rebase instead of merging with git pull
 KMcQuisten	Ah, yes
 n4nd0	I am far from being a git expert so be critic towards my comments too ;)
 KMcQuisten	No worries.  I fully plan to RTFM
 KMcQuisten	So in the most recent build, Is the RealFeatures wrapper for python_modular named that way for backwards compatibility?  Is the code in the DenseFeatures.cpp file, since there is no RealFeatrues.cpp?

 n4nd0	sonney2k: around?
 n4nd0	does someone know how to add a module for modular interfaces?
 n4nd0	I created a directory so with some classes inside
 n4nd0	I have modified the files for swig insid interfaces/modular to include these files
 n4nd0	but I still got ImportError: No module named SO in my python program
 ckwidmer	hi n4nd0
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: hi
 ckwidmer	have you trying to replicate the steps needed for another module
 ckwidmer	?
 ckwidmer	usually what I do when e.g. adding a new class
 n4nd0	yes, but it seems that there must be a step that I am missing
 ckwidmer	check where another particular class name occures in interface files etc
 ckwidmer	have you grepped through all the files?
 n4nd0	yeah I am grepping all the way :)
 ckwidmer	hmm
 n4nd0	but I must be missing something
 ckwidmer	the other (rather obvious) thing that comes to my mind is make clean
 ckwidmer	before compiling?
 n4nd0	I thought that they key was to add my SO.i and SO_includes.i in interfaces/modular/modushogun.i but didn't work
 n4nd0	I actually changed a make file too
 n4nd0	so I think that it built everything again but I am going to try forcing the clean
 ckwidmer	oh btw
 ckwidmer	have you talked to nico about the cplex error?
 n4nd0	oh I remember he pasted for me on a mail about an error
 ckwidmer	yes
 n4nd0	but I didn't look into it, sorry
 ckwidmer	there is some problem with CLabels
 ckwidmer	if cplex compile flag is set
 n4nd0	ahm
 n4nd0	can you paste the error for me again please?
 gsomix	n4nd0, do you use python_modula?
 n4nd0	in the mail it appears with quite a few of strange characters
 ckwidmer	well, you can reproduce it if you have cplex
 n4nd0	gsomix: yeah, configure is run for python-modular
 ckwidmer	otherwise it'll be hard to do
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: ok, I'll do that then once I am done with my multiclass example for SO
 gsomix	ah, yes. n4nd0, maybe you should look at makefiles?
 ckwidmer	so, back to your module problem, so you've included SO.i and SO_includes.i from modshogun.i?
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: yes
 ckwidmer	and it compiles just fine, but you don't see it from python?
 n4nd0	gsomix: so in shogun/Makefile I added SO in a for loop inside install-python-modular
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: make and make install work well
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: but from shogun.SO import bla bla bla doesn't work
 n4nd0	there must be somewhere where to define explicitily a module for modular interfaces
 n4nd0	mmm I have just found something that could be the answer to my problem in shogun/CMakeLists.txt
 n4nd0	I am going to try
 n4nd0	but actually I am not using cmake so I don' have much hope here
 ckwidmer	n4nd0, have you checked whether your new module (or files therein) is included in some "intermediate" file, such as python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: so I have several lines like this one
 n4nd0	#define SWIGTYPE_p_shogun__CStructuredModel swig_types[947]
 n4nd0	CStructuredModel is something I have defined inside shogun/so/
 ckwidmer	ok
 ckwidmer	also the includes?
 ckwidmer	e.g.  #include <shogun/classifier/LPBoost.h>
 n4nd0	ckwidmer: yes
 n4nd0	although I have found that python_modular/Makefile didn't contain SO in a for loop it does in what seems to me each of the modules
 n4nd0	so I have added SO and I am building again
 n4nd0	nice it worked!!
 ckwidmer	awesome
 n4nd0	yeah
 ckwidmer	yeah, just saw that loop
 n4nd0	but I don't think it is the good solution though
 n4nd0	isn't this makefile automatically generated?
 ckwidmer	is that makefile autogenerated?
 ckwidmer	i guess not
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	no idea
 n4nd0	I will see next time I build
 ckwidmer	well
 n4nd0	it is not in the repo so probably it is autogenerated
 ckwidmer	if it isn't
 ckwidmer	this should be documented
 ckwidmer	yeah, I would think os
 ckwidmer	so
 n4nd0	agree
 ckwidmer	have you tried configure again
 n4nd0	I read README.developer but there is nothing about creating new modules
 n4nd0	no, I have not
 ckwidmer	yeah
 ckwidmer	I think just quickly figure out if its autogen
 n4nd0	I hope you don't mind but I will do this later since I don't want to re-build everything again now :S
 ckwidmer	just don't forget about it, as you've figured it out now - if we don't get this right, now someone else will have to retrace your steps in the future
 n4nd0	yes
 ckwidmer	great :)
 n4nd0	ckwidmer, gsomix : thank your very much for your help guys!
 ckwidmer	you're welcome
 n4nd0	I am very excited about doing this test :D
* n4nd0 has changed to debug mode after weeks of untested coding

 ckwidmer	n4nd0 sure
 ckwidmer	what's up?
 n4nd0	yeah, I have a python/swig problem that I don't manage to fix
 n4nd0	I am sorry, I think I am kind of abusing consulting today :S
 ckwidmer	no worries, go ahead
 n4nd0	it looks like this
 n4nd0	NotImplementedError: Wrong number or type of arguments for overloaded function 'new_PrimalMosekSOSVM'.
 n4nd0	  Possible C/C++ prototypes are:
 n4nd0	    shogun::CPrimalMosekSOSVM::CPrimalMosekSOSVM()
 n4nd0	    shogun::CPrimalMosekSOSVM::CPrimalMosekSOSVM(shogun::CStructuredModel *,CLossFunction *,shogun::CStructuredLabels *,shogun::CFeatures *)
 n4nd0	I have checked that the arguments are correct in order
 ckwidmer	hmm
 n4nd0	I find weird that the second argument doesn't have shogun::
 ckwidmer	maybe a good place to start is trying methods that take only CStructuredModel or CStructuredLabels as arguments
 ckwidmer	true
 ckwidmer	are you sure the individual ones work elsewhere?
 ckwidmer	possibly your new classes aren't registered correctly
 n4nd0	do you mean like for example using setters to try them out?
 ckwidmer	yes
 ckwidmer	exactly
 ckwidmer	so you can narrow down the problem
 n4nd0	I am going to create those setters then and try it
 ckwidmer	alright
 ckwidmer	if you discover that it doesn't work with one particular class
 ckwidmer	retrace all the occurences of another class
 ckwidmer	and make sure you have it registered in all right places
 n4nd0	I don't think I understand what do you mean with retrace all the occurrences of another class
 ckwidmer	well
 ckwidmer	grepping through all files
 ckwidmer	looking for e.g. LPBoost
 n4nd0	ok, I think I got you now

 n4nd0	they are turning out to be tough ones :S
 nicococo	ohh. why?
 n4nd0	I don't manage to solve them :P
 nicococo	i see
 n4nd0	I don't know if they are just swig/python related or of the framework in general
 nicococo	okay.. i am sorry i can not help with that :(
 n4nd0	it is like if the hierarchy is not detected  when I want to make use of it from python
 n4nd0	e.g. I do in an object called sosvm that is of type PrimalMosekSOSVM
 n4nd0	sosvm.set_model(model)
 n4nd0	model is of type MulticlassModel
 n4nd0	MulticlassModel inherits from StructuredModel
 n4nd0	but it tells me that I cannot do that set_model
 n4nd0	that the argument needs to be StructuredModel
 n4nd0	:S
 nicococo	oha
 n4nd0	nicococo: just tell me if you have any guess, I am already witout ideas ...
 nicococo	well its rather technical .. i wouldn't guess, instead i would call soeren :)  (or someone else like ckwidmer)
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey! do you have any idea about it ^?
 blackburn	a min
 n4nd0	thank you
 blackburn	n4nd0: which problem exactly?
 n4nd0	when I do set_model(model) I get
 n4nd0	TypeError: in method 'StructuredOutputMachine_set_model', argument 2 of type 'CStructuredModel *'
 n4nd0	the object model I am using is from a child class of CStructuredModel

 blackburn	what is header?
 n4nd0	it is like it doesn't recognize the inheritance
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/so/MulticlassModel.h
 n4nd0	that is the child class
 n4nd0	here is the parent
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/so/StructuredModel.h
 blackburn	no swig works perfectly with inheritance :)
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	I meant it more like I am doing something wrong somewhere about it :D
 n4nd0	I have the same problem with another member CLossFunction
 blackburn	just some quick guess while I'm thinking
 blackburn	try to add "class CStructuredModel;" in multiclass model
 blackburn	and check whether they are included in SO.i in a proper order
 n4nd0	all right
 n4nd0	first parent, then child right?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	they were in the right order
 n4nd0	I am compiling after including class CStructuredModel
 blackburn	aham
 n4nd0	it didn't make the trick :(
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	bad
 n4nd0	I think I will have to wait and ask Soeren about this
 n4nd0	nicococo: I will try later to do the example in C++
 n4nd0	I don't think that this error will appear there
 nicococo	ok
 n4nd0	nicococo: I can let you know by mail once I know something more about it ok?
 nicococo	that would be fine
 n4nd0	nicococo: did you take a look to the other parts of the code as well?
 n4nd0	MulticlassSOLabels and PrimalMosekSOSVM
 nicococo	yep
 n4nd0	anything about it?
 nicococo	looks pretty good :)
 nicococo	i need to have a look again on PrimalMosekSOSVM
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	looks okay to me too.. so, i am looking forward to hear some exciting news about working multiclass example ;)

 KMcQuisten	Yeah, the MKL is working.  Avoiding the LINADD seems to help.  I'm working on something else now.
 KMcQuisten	I'm really excited about using DirectorKernels, but the examples acess data from a global.  to access data from withing one, using get_rhs() and get_lhs(), i'm working on a version of obtain_from_generic for DenseFeatures and StringFeatures
 blackburn	ah that's nice
 gsomix	KMcQuisten, hello. Sorry, I don't replied to your mail. I'm working on this problem now.
 KMcQuisten	Well, I wrote up the code, it compiles properly, wraps properly in swig, and when I test it I can extract the data.  However, I get the following code when I actually try and use it in a kenrel in LibSVR:
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: do you have a fork?
 KMcQuisten	Yes
 blackburn	so will you do a pull request with it?
 KMcQuisten	(This is the output from training with MSG_DEBUG on

 KMcQuisten	If I can get it to work, yes.
 KMcQuisten	What kind of approach have you taken with the, gsomix
 KMcQuisten	?
 KMcQuisten	I know you're working on Director stuff, so I don't want to step on your solution if you have one
 KMcQuisten	All i've done is modify the obtain_from_generic used in BinaryLabels, and adapeted it to the features

 KMcQuisten	gamma is a parameter of the object I descended from DirectorKernel
 blackburn	could you please cut after genf2 and return 0.0
 KMcQuisten	gsomix:  That sounds like the best way
 KMcQuisten	blackburn: Sure
 blackburn	just to check whether obtain does something wrong
 KMcQuisten	it gets to [INFO] Computing gradient for initial set of non-zero alphas, and then segfaults
 blackburn	wow

 blackburn	and without anything? just return 0.0
 KMcQuisten	lets see
 KMcQuisten	Fatal Python error: GC object already tracked
 blackburn	hmm that sounds bad
 KMcQuisten	Yeah, something's getting garbage collected before it should
 KMcQuisten	I looked around to find a solution, and the only seemingly informative thing I've found is this:
 KMcQuisten	http://pyrit.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/385/
 KMcQuisten	It has an explanation of a similar problem, along with a specific link to some python documentation
 KMcQuisten	But I don't know enough about SWIG to do anythign useful with this info
 KMcQuisten	gsomix:  What do you think?  How's the typemapping work going so far?
 blackburn	hmm let me check
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: I'll check typemaps
 KMcQuisten	Ok, if I strip out everything but return 0 in the kernel_function, and use only the DirectorKernel default __init__(), I get this:
 KMcQuisten	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Swig::DirectorMethodException'
 blackburn	hmm

 gsomix	KMcQuisten, 'Swig::DirectorMethodException' | it's seems that I forget about some virtual methods.
 gsomix	sorry, need some time to check .____.
 KMcQuisten	No sweat :)
 gsomix	KMcQuisten, aha, forgot
 KMcQuisten	?
 gsomix	KMcQuisten, forgot to add some virtuals methods from CKernel to CDirectorKernel. it's might be a reason of 'Swig::DirectorMethodException'.
 KMcQuisten	Ah, I see
 KMcQuisten	Let me know how it goes so I can test it
 KMcQuisten	:)
 gsomix	KMcQuisten, ok.
 gsomix	KMcQuisten, little experiment with automagically converting (CFeatures* to CDenseFeatures*) is works
 KMcQuisten	Sweet!
 KMcQuisten	That and CStringKernels are the two main types I use
 gsomix	I need time to write complete converting.
 KMcQuisten	Right
