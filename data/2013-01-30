 sonne|work	n4nd0: I realize that an extra page won't work - we would somehow need another nesting level
 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm not sure why it won't work
 n4nd0	tell me
 sonne|work	n4nd0: It would be good to have one page with announcements/news about the workshop, one with the program and one for registration and later one for user contributed slides/code or so
 n4nd0	what is your idea? how do you want it to look like?
 sonne|work	but this will only work for 2013
 sonne|work	if we have another WS in 2014 what then?
 n4nd0	ok I see your point now
 n4nd0	the idea would be to go to events
 n4nd0	later to workshop 2013
 n4nd0	and then find those pages
 n4nd0	right now workshop 2013 and workshop program are at the same level, which it is not that ^ idea
 sonne|work	yeah...

 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am talking to Bernard about it
 n4nd0	we will find a solution
 sonne|work	cool thx
 n4nd0	sonne|work: btw I still have my SO-SVM question :)
 n4nd0	maybe you have a minute for it?
 sonne|work	which is?
 n4nd0	does it handle predictions over continuous structured data?
 n4nd0	for what I have read so far, the framework presented in Tsochantaridis which is what I know for SO-SVM doesn't do it
 n4nd0	some papers about kernel density estimation, and joint kernel estimation handle that; but those are other things
 sonne|work	you mean e.g. a task like learn where roads end, e.g. split a road after x meters
 sonne|work	so non-discrete segmentation
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	think of the HM-SVM too for example, the SO-SVM predicts sequence of states there
 n4nd0	and each state is identified with an integer
 n4nd0	what about sequences of states where each state is a real number?
 n4nd0	it sounds a bit like regression I think, I have seen something called structured output regression too
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I think something like this is around for at least hidden markov models
 sonne|work	something with continuous state space hmms
 n4nd0	I have been looking around quite a lot but didn't find anything promising to tell the truth
 sonne|work	I just had a look
 sonne|work	wikipedia names it also like this
 sonne|work	no idea about concrete papers though
 sonne|work	didn't need it yet
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I looke up in wikipedia, they called it linear dynamical system
 blackburn	I am still convinced linear dynamical systems are related to math :D
 sonne|work	sounds like differential equation
 n4nd0	blackburn: isn't machine learning related to math? :)
 blackburn	I consider machine learning as a tool to *estimate* dependencies not known before
 n4nd0	state spaces are represented via differential equations
 n4nd0	blackburn: don't you find that correspondence in this problem?
 n4nd0	estimate the dependencies between observations and states that have produced those observations
 blackburn	well differential equation is known dependency with unknown parameters
 n4nd0	in addition to dependencies between states in a chain themselves
 blackburn	okay, I just can't imagine so-svm find something for that :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: why not?
 n4nd0	blackburn: does it seem natural for you if the states are discrete? i.e. in a more common HMM
 blackburn	I don't know - a little more
 sonne|work	blackburn: well my example above  a task like learn where roads end, e.g. split a road after x meters would be continuous state space
 blackburn	sonne|work: and estimate that from say video?
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	that sounds pretty complex to handle with anything linear
 sonne|work	though video is descrete :)
 blackburn	well I have seen SO used for stereo disparity estimation
 blackburn	n4nd0: is that the case?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes, it is an example
 blackburn	then I am more convinced it is possible
 n4nd0	people use SO for human pose estimation all the time
 n4nd0	there are a bunch of papers about it
 n4nd0	that is continuous state space
 blackburn	the main problem is features construction I guess
 n4nd0	I would guess for SIFT and SURF type of features
 blackburn	with keypoints?
 blackburn	or dense?
 n4nd0	idk
 ptizoom	hi... I am lost....
 n4nd0	hi ptizoom
 n4nd0	what is it?
 ptizoom	I spend a lot of time trying to link different idea on auto-learning instead of trying to finishing off this swig-perl with sparse matrix...
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	you probably learnt a lot on auto-learning :)
 ptizoom	also still looking for a smart way to translate 'python' tests into 'perl' tests!
 n4nd0	I see
 ptizoom	please direct me into a nice group who does this kind of stuff "learning and matching parsing relations"...
 n4nd0	I have never used that
 ptizoom	yep, parsers are nice candidates to be auto-learned! I thought using hidden markov approx (like every one), but really how to picking up local features an work relevant relations in an  orthogonal (kernelized) fashion...
 ptizoom	eg. does someone know how to create a stemmer ? I believe HMM algo is not enough.
 ptizoom	even more it seems shogun can only use a 2-gram HMM.....
 ptizoom	ho well... may be see you in Berlin!
 n4nd0	:)
 sonne|work	ptizoom: yeah come to berlin :)
 n4nd0	ptizoom: regarding the stemmer
 n4nd0	I suggest you to take a look to http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/
 n4nd0	they have very good material in there, slides, book, etc

 ptizoom	thanks n4nd0,(I like this name), I have been rumbling my soul at nlp.standford.edu indeed. I even got up to taste the madness of Wolfram...and his amazing cellular automatons... that shall be the way to program (he said), I ended up in looking into the F4 algo to reduce critical pairs...yes, one to select features needs to make some choices....
 n4nd0	it sounds like you had lot of fun :)
 ptizoom	yes, but I still do not get it.
 ptizoom	it is something beautiful , about ways of rewriting equations, involving the golden ratio....!

 ptizoom	anyway, yes http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/ will do! Thanks for the tip.

 n4nd0	you are welcome
-!- kakashi_ [~kakashi_@nltk/kakashi] has joined #shogun
 kakashi_	Hi, does shogun have an SVD implementation? If so, is there a performance analysis of the same?
 sonne|work	blackburn: ^
 kakashi_	well, I was just browsing through the code and foundout a rough jacobi implementation?
 kakashi_	or it seems to use eigen++, hmmm
 n4nd0	kakashi_: we mainly use eigen or arpack for linear algebra
 kakashi_	n4nd0: aha, can you give me any links? also, can I use sparse matrices?
 n4nd0	kakashi_: where do you want to use the sparse matrices?
 n4nd0	we have some nice sparse features :)
 n4nd0	links to where? examples of where svd is used in shogun?
 kakashi_	yes, well, liknks to some examples
 kakashi_	at present I have a sparse matrix in scipy.sparse or pysparse format (and ofcourse their combinations including a (row, column, data) as a csv is also doable)
 kakashi_	dimensions are approx (10000x200000)
 n4nd0	I will be back in a few minutes
 kakashi_	sure
 kakashi_	take your time
 n4nd0	back
 n4nd0	kakashi_: in multiclass/QDA.cpp SVD is used IIRC
 n4nd0	yeah exactly
 n4nd0	wrap_svd
 n4nd0	wrap_dgesvd sorry
 kakashi_	I see, is there any python wrapper, by anychance?
 sonne|work	nope
 kakashi_	hmm, btw, this is SVD of a dense matrix, right?
 n4nd0	kakashi_: I think that example probably is
 n4nd0	what do you want to do? svd for a sparse matrix from python?
 n4nd0	shouldn't there be something in scipy for that?
 kakashi_	python would be great (numpy/scipy/sparsesvd are pretty slow)
 kakashi_	scipy.sparse uses arapack implementation, a single svd of the 10000x200000 takes approx 2-3 days

 n4nd0	hehe that's lot of time
 n4nd0	I am not aware if there are faster implementations
 n4nd0	maybe there are some approximate methods out there
 kakashi_	hmm, thanks anyways!
 sonne|work	kakashi_: might be that blackburn knows though...
 kakashi_	aha! sure, I will keep an eye on it ...
 kakashi_	I have not seen anything that is as good as mahout's implementation, but the pity is all my code is in java and JPype may obfuscate the code :(
 kakashi_	s/java/python

 kakashi_	I think they use jacobi implementation
 kakashi_	n4nd0: i will be back in a while
 blackburn	kakashi_: we have some code ported from redsvd
 blackburn	may be it is of interest for you

@sonney2k	n4nd0, what did bernard say?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that we have to change some css and python code
 n4nd0	he said he is a bit busy now
 n4nd0	but I will try to do it with his mentorship :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: so does that mean I should answer you?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	you submitted the form
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes I am trying to automate the stuff
@sonney2k	like that the mailinglist gets the form
 blackburn	sonney2k okay - am I subscribed to that list btw?
@sonney2k	A user made changes from 1/31/13 2:40 AM to 2:40 AM (Azerbaijan Standard Time) ?
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, IDK
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah so you live in azerbaijan
 blackburn	it is not the best notification we could see
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	not very helpful
 blackburn	yeah we can view the lnie but still
@sonney2k	blackburn, would even say that this is useless
@sonney2k	so I think it would be better you reply everyone submitting manually
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I see no other way so far
@sonney2k	it is no use to create any kind of automagic notification
 blackburn	sonney2k: some js could help
@sonney2k	so about the mailinglist
 blackburn	but nobody wants to do that
@sonney2k	how should we do it?
@sonney2k	subscribe people to it?
 blackburn	hmm can you let me send mails from that list?
@sonney2k	I originally wanted to use it for notifications
@sonney2k	such that heiko/you/me etc get an email
@sonney2k	but now idk
@sonney2k	blackburn, you can use whatever address you want in from:
 blackburn	well probably the best way could be - I subscribe for these notices
 blackburn	once somebody submits the form I write him a mail from @shogun-toolbox.org
 blackburn	and CC it to workshop@shogun-toolbox.org
 blackburn	which has you, me, .... in subscribers
 blackburn	gut?
 blackburn	sleep time
@sonney2k	blackburn, yup!
@sonney2k	blackburn, or alternatively you subscribe everyone registering to that mailinglist and we can use it for updates later
 blackburn	sonney2k: we need something private then
@sonney2k	n4nd0, hmmhh I tried to embed the form
 blackburn	to BCC
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
@sonney2k	blackburn, mailinglist is not giving out email addresses of others...
 blackburn	I mean if we subscribe they will receive answers purposed for other people
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but it does not like me
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh I see yes sure
 blackburn	lets just use it for our purposes
@sonney2k	blackburn, might be enough to just send around these emails among us few (all in CC)
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	hmm yes
 blackburn	then mailing list is not needed for all
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what can it be?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it converts the iframe to some text
 n4nd0	funny
@sonney2k	that is the code we need to insert to have it directly on the page <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEFoS0Q2U19qYkdjT2VReFNvNDBoclE6MQ" width="760" height="1629" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but it removes iframes
 blackburn	isn't iframe something from 1992?
@sonney2k	blackburn, only for people that attend
 blackburn	hmm I am probably wrong
@sonney2k	blackburn, click 'embed on website' in the spreadsheet
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess you meant frames
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I mix it up with something else
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	frames are left behind before your first kiss
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you mean integrating it to the page?
 blackburn	isn't better to just put a url?
