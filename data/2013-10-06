@HeikoS	hello!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: he
 lisitsyn	y
@HeikoS	hi!
@HeikoS	how are things?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: fine, what about you? working on submission?
 lisitsyn	I am reading it right now btw
@HeikoS	yeah doing that
@HeikoS	pimping notebooks a bit
@HeikoS	would be good if we had the other things also, might also be good for release
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have no concerns with text
 lisitsyn	may be mention LibSVM and Liblinear
 lisitsyn	and LibOCAS may e
@HeikoS	isnt that in there?
@HeikoS	yeah in the methods
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: only libsvm
@HeikoS	thats in the external software
 lisitsyn	may be liblinear makes sense too
@HeikoS	but I did not want to make them overlapping
 lisitsyn	ah I see
@HeikoS	libsvm=liblinear for most people isnt it?
 lisitsyn	I don't know how people see it to be honest :)
@HeikoS	ok will add

@HeikoS	lambday: hey!
 lambday	HeikoS: hi how are you :)
 lambday	am I still there :-/
@HeikoS	lambday: pretty good and you?
@HeikoS	yes
 lambday	HeikoS: pretty bad :( just hoping that things will get better :-s
@HeikoS	whats wrong?
 lambday	HeikoS: when is the  release date?
@HeikoS	we wanted to do it over the weekend, but didnt ;) soon!
@HeikoS	we need to fix many things
 lambday	HeikoS: institute related shits :-/
@HeikoS	but we also need the release for the nips application
@HeikoS	lambday: ah, do you have trouble with your supervisors?
@HeikoS	wiking: around?
@HeikoS	wiking: I need a link for the cloud shogun for the application
@HeikoS	besser82: ^
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah! when I told the idea about working regarding the idea the exact words he told was "don't you try to shove down my throat some work that you worked for Google"!!
 lisitsyn	haven't you ever thought of changing supervisor ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: you did not even work for google, but for Shogun!
@HeikoS	anyway, lambday try to calm things down, that always helps
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: whats the state on the opencv example?
 lisitsyn	buy a machine gun
@HeikoS	I would like to reference that
 lisitsyn	ehm I don't know
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you want to have?
@HeikoS	currently I can only reference the gist of pickle
 lisitsyn	I can do something using that
 lisitsyn	but I don't know what
@HeikoS	just the thing itself
@HeikoS	would be great to have in the repository

 lambday_	HeikoS: do you think we should get rid of arprec?
@HeikoS	lambday_: not sure, if we can get rid of the memory bug, then no, if thats not possible then yes
@HeikoS	lambday_: but thats no focus
@HeikoS	focus is release for now, only things that are very important
 lambday_	HeikoS: anything that I can help with
 lambday_	HeikoS: I really reduce the runtime of the notebok
 lambday_	book*
@HeikoS	fixing github issues  would be a great help
 lambday_	should*
@HeikoS	lambday_: ah I think the notebook currently fails
@HeikoS	that is important to work
 lambday_	ah!!
 lambday_	:'(
 lambday_	HeikoS: alright.. so I am thinking to reducing the samples from 10 to 1
@HeikoS	cant you also reduce the number of colours?
 lambday_	HeikoS: and dropping the part that computes exact log-det cause that takes a lot of memory
@HeikoS	lambday_: yeah just comment out for now or so
 lambday_	HeikoS: that won't eb good
 lambday_	HeikoS: we gotta use all the colors
 lambday_	HeikoS: we can reduce the number of shifts
@HeikoS	lambday_: ok shifts then is good
@HeikoS	and the exact stuff
 lambday_	yeah
@HeikoS	lambday_: just focus on making it work with the stuff that is there
 lambday_	alright
 lambday_	alright'
 lambday_	sonne|osx said 7 mins
 lambday_	that would be a bit tough! but let's see
@HeikoS	yeah, small steps towards there ;)
 lambday_	HeikoS: preconditioned CG is required in many many applications man! we gotta make outr implementation top notch!
@HeikoS	lambday_: yeah I know, it is essential
@HeikoS	lambday_: so would be great to have, also its pretty interesting to integrate that into our framework
 lambday_	HeikoS: with chain of operators...
@HeikoS	yeah, but lambday_ we really have to make the notebook work asap
@HeikoS	its blocking the others on the page
 lambday_	HeikoS: alright.. yeah that's first priority
 lambday_	HeikoS: I will surely try to make this work in coming 2-3 daysw
@HeikoS	lambday_: well have to exclude it from the release if it doesnt work and that would be a shame
 lambday_	yeah! :(
 lambday_	it looks pretty awesome! :(
 lambday_	(thanks to you)
@HeikoS	it does, maybe just comment out some parts for now?
 lambday_	HeikoS: yeah!
@HeikoS	and then commit this, and then fix in the background?
@HeikoS	could you do that?
 lambday_	HeikoS: checking now

 lambday	and then it stops!
 lambday	just did rebase and this is what I get
@HeikoS	lambday: manually uninstall, remove build dir, and do git clean -dfx that fixes it
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
@HeikoS	lambday: gotta go home now, see you around! :) thanks for helping on the fix
 lambday	HeikoS: no problem man!

 iglesiasg	hi devl82
 devl82	i have an installation problem using ubuntu13.04+shogun3.0+matlab13a
 devl82	specifically ccmake tells me "Could not find Matlab, which is required for compiling matlab_static    interface.  Try setting MATLAB_ROOT enviroment variable to the right path"
 hushell	iglesiasg: hey
 devl82	however using sexport MATLAB_ROOT='/usr/local/MATLAB'
 devl82	i meant export
 devl82	and testing it with echo "unix('env');quit" | matlab -nojvm -nodisplay | grep MATLAB
 devl82	i should have been ok ..any suggestions?
 lisitsyn	devl82: hey
 lisitsyn	devl82: did you try to run cmake again after your export?
 devl82	hey lisitsyn ..yeap exactly the same message
 lisitsyn	devl82: what about removing build folder and running cmake?
 lisitsyn	did you try that too?
 devl82	nope i will try that.. thank you
 devl82	very much:)
 lisitsyn	devl82: let me know whether it works
 devl82	ok..

 hushell	iglesiasg: I am good :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: how is the PR going? Is it good to merge?
 iglesiasg	hushell: let me see
 iglesiasg	hushell: so you removed the normalization you had added in the bundle methods at the end?
 hushell	iglesiasg: yes, I feel in this way might be better, not touching the original code
 hushell	iglesiasg: but when using verbose mode, the code will be 2x slower, I guess not too bad

@lisitsyn	what fixes?
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 29m09s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hmmhh I am wondering if it is possible to pass float32 feature types to the Chi2Kernel's init()
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, forget it
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, everything OK
@sonney2k	we nicely catch this
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's design gap
@sonney2k	no all good
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no that's a gap ;)
@lisitsyn	once you get float32 features you are very restricted
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ?
@sonney2k	not very no
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: how to use chi2 with float32?
@sonney2k	not possible
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: and you say it is not gap? ;)
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	gaussian, poly, linear, etc etc kernel work with any feature type
@lisitsyn	because they are using dotfeatures, right?
@sonney2k	and I would rather not implement further ops in dotfeatures
@sonney2k	yes
@lisitsyn	but once we are using densefeatures shit happens
@lisitsyn	that's a major flaw
@sonney2k	Why?
@sonney2k	it is like saying a string kernel should work with double
@lisitsyn	no, but chi2 should work with float32

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, where is the design flaw then?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, kernels are meant to be optimized for a single data type
@sonney2k	if we want high speed stuff there is no way around this
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I am not that sure it is impossible
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: at least it could work for both types
@sonney2k	how?
@lisitsyn	dispatching the type once is not that difficult
@lisitsyn	and it won't disable high speed
@sonney2k	ugly!
@sonney2k	and won't work currently
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: isn't she ugly right now?
@sonney2k	since we require certain feature types in kernels
@sonney2k	not when drunk!
 iglesiasg	lol
@lisitsyn	it must be stevie wonder's song about chi2
@lisitsyn	I still don't have any solution but it is flawed
@lisitsyn	well I know how to solve it
@lisitsyn	but you won't like it
@lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	?
@lisitsyn	expression templates etc
@lisitsyn	compile time will raise more
@lisitsyn	although it may fail to resolve typing problem
