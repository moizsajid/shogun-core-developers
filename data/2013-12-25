 Saurabh7	hi , anybody around?
@sonney2k	Saurabh7, moin
 Saurabh7	sonney2k, hello ,so i was tinkering with some xval stuff and i found
 Saurabh7	shouldn't https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/libshogun/splitting_standard_crossvalidation.cpp#L77
 Saurabh7	be   get_label(subset.vector[j]) ??
@sonney2k	Saurabh7, IMHO yes - but it is Heiko who wrote the code - so better ask him
 Saurabh7	 ok sure, thanks!

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, one question - when you call apply_structured - will it *always* generate a new label?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, tell me more
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well I thought you are the expert...
@sonney2k	I just need to know if apply_structured will create a new object (like all the other apply* methods) or not
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yes, it will

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add small comparison section to MC svms
@wiking	sonney2k: i've setup the thing for shogun (coveralls...)
@wiking	sonney2k: but doesn't really work i think

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: improve naive bayes tutorial
@sonney2k	wiking, maybe it needs https://github.com/eddyxu/cpp-coveralls
@sonney2k	I recall lisitsyn wanting to implement that for some time but ...
* sonney2k enjoys doing notebooks
@wiking	sonney2k: did that
@sonney2k	wiking, you did? did we enable gcov when compiling them?
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean i really tried eveyrthing to setup coveralls.io for shogun like 6 months ago
@wiking	sonney2k: yes it was part of my cmake 'patch'
@wiking	sonney2k: plz give me some credit when i said i tried it ;P
@wiking	sonney2k: btW: merry xmas
@sonney2k	wiking, same to you
@sonney2k	wiking, well I have no idea what you do/did so apologies
@wiking	nw
@sonney2k	I think we need some kernels tutorial
@wiking	i'm just saying that i've tried but the stats
@sonney2k	and string kernels
@sonney2k	and mkl
@wiking	were not really working..
@sonney2k	and performance measures
@sonney2k	doing this makes me feel like being back in the 60's
@sonney2k	:D
@wiking	notebook?
@sonney2k	wiking, btw about the whole license discussion
@sonney2k	wiking, yes
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm idont even know what's the current status
@sonney2k	wiking, I think we either stick with GPL or BSD
@sonney2k	all the rest is a waste
@sonney2k	my interest in switching to anything is rather limited
@wiking	4 votes = 3 for lgpl 1 for bsd
@sonney2k	yeah but doesn't make sense
@wiking	so not many people voteD: P
@sonney2k	either we want to team up with scikits people
@sonney2k	and so need BSD
@sonney2k	or stay as we are
@wiking	well imho we'll stay like this for at least 2 more releases
@sonney2k	I mean the only reason to switch licenses would be to somehow be the C++ backend of scikits
@wiking	as it'll take a long time regardless of license we will go with (if we change)
@sonney2k	I mean seriously
@sonney2k	everyone is using scikits for quick stuff
@wiking	mmm dunno if scikits ppl would be interested in that
@sonney2k	when using python
@sonney2k	if not then why change?
@wiking	as that's the good part of scikits
@sonney2k	it is not getting us users
@wiking	fast implementation
@sonney2k	and who cares about M$ forking shogun?
@wiking	mmm it's more about
@sonney2k	I mean it usually is the training algorithm that is complex
@wiking	smaller entities using shogun
@sonney2k	all the rest is soo trivial
@sonney2k	so no need for more 'liberal' licenses
@wiking	sonney2k: as lisitsyn pointed out we could at least give a BSD-like inference interface
@sonney2k	yeah that makes the most sense I think
@wiking	yeah that requires horizontal slicing of the library
@sonney2k	it is tough still since it includes all kernels etc etc
@sonney2k	yeah and that
@wiking	but we would need a vertical one as well
@wiking	make it more modular
@sonney2k	but no one knows how
@sonney2k	IMHO we should go d-ptr's
@wiking	not as one big bundle
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah that's like step 1
@sonney2k	and then maybe we see how a split could work
@wiking	we need to define how to do dptrs
@sonney2k	wiking, btw *I* cannot fix proto for 3.1 for osx
@wiking	sonney2k: no macbook air around?
@sonney2k	wiking, and btw I have a new idea for meetings
@sonney2k	wiking, just no time
@wiking	sonney2k: ah ok
@sonney2k	wiking, IMHO we should do the meetings like this:
@wiking	sonney2k: for dptrs we should write a small howto
@sonney2k	wiking, every monday evening from 20-24hrs we have our shogun evening
@wiking	sonney2k: and then core developers can start implementing that
@sonney2k	wiking, so everyone who has time can attend
@sonney2k	and we chat and code
@wiking	sonney2k: and maybe even starte a feature branch...
@sonney2k	everyone tries to be there
@wiking	sonney2k: sounds reasonable
@sonney2k	and if not well not
@sonney2k	it is kind of what we call 'Stammtisch' :)
@sonney2k	in German
@wiking	we could implement that
@wiking	but not before 1st of jan
@wiking	or of course we can
@wiking	but i think the attendance might be low on the 30th
@wiking	so 6th would be the first one ... that's reasonable
@sonney2k	I mean I know people are overloaded / busy with other stuff but hey better a long stretched fun meeting than none
@sonney2k	wiking, and if we want to be in GSoC 2014 we have to start serious planning already now...
@sonney2k	so I will release 3.1 before end of vacations and then we can do other stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, btw what happened to your libarchive endeavour?
@wiking	sonney2k: i had quite a problem with libarchive supporting raw file
@wiking	sonney2k: but i do have the feature branch localhost
@wiking	sonney2k: btw for dptrs we would just need so set some very basic rules: file and class naming convention
@wiking	sonney2k: and create some macros supporting dptrs
@wiking	like the qt stuff: Q_DECLARE_PRIVATE and Q_DECLARE_PUBLIC
@wiking	and i think we could write about this a small page on github
 shogun-buildbot	build #2106 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2106  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	wiking, makes sense
@sonney2k	wiking, if you have time draft that thing - we should start that right after 3.1 ... and btw I don't expect new major releases after end of gsoc'14 :/
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Dpointers-in-Shogun
@wiking	there
@wiking	we should put there the main rules
@sonney2k	I mean only if we have just a few new features d-ptr's are heavily intrusive already bringing stuff into a non-releasable state
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm ok i'll try to scetch up something based on qt's ideas
@sonney2k	wiking, maybe you can try that on some small class to see if it works
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah will do on classes that i've implemented
@sonney2k	wiking, I personally would want to do notebooks for a while atm - I am really enjoying that part
@wiking	sonney2k: go ahead and have fun
@wiking	sonney2k: i'm trying to digest xmas food atm
@wiking	:P
@wiking	sonney2k: check those awesome social mining notebooks i've sent the other day
@wiking	sonney2k: if you could hack in there some shogun that would be amazing
 lisitsyn	ho ho
@sonney2k	wiking, seen them but we far away from that still - we first need lots of pieces of the puzzle before we get there

@sonney2k	and mr ho ho lisitsyn needs to contribute his stuff as notebooks too :D
 lisitsyn	sounds like a great time to do that haha
 lisitsyn	oh gosh will this stuff ever end
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you just wrote too much shogun code
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, now you have to document it :P
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I mean my current status
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, all your fault ;)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: totally
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, become the paid shogun e.V. secretary ;)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: 100 EUR/year? ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, exactly :P
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I totally like your stammwhatever idea
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ah yeah and I like idea of visiting berlin once again though I'd like to visit other eu cities too :D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: do you want to visit that py conference?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, don't count on me for anything - I am no better time wise
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: probably even worse
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I was hoping Heiko would give a talk at europython
 lisitsyn	I see
@sonney2k	and that we could have some workshop before or after
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about gsoc?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I remember you said you will have much less time
@sonney2k	mustn't be of the standard we set last year but still some talks or so and discussions
@sonney2k	yeah Heiko has the notes
@sonney2k	we had like 100 ideas ...
@sonney2k	but we need some mentors / organizers
@sonney2k	so the thing runs even with me disappearing
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I see - I'll try to reserve as much time as I can
@sonney2k	IMHO heiko should be admin too
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: why too?
@sonney2k	because he almost was one last year
@sonney2k	from what he did I mean
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: too like who?
@sonney2k	what?
@sonney2k	you me heiko?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I mean he is kinda the only admin
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	apart from you I am totally useless
@sonney2k	why that?
 lisitsyn	so its he who could handle that if he has time
@sonney2k	yeah - I would wish to just be a mentor
@sonney2k	shogun and teaching is what I would like to pursue...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you should have been a professor ;)
