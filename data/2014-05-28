 uzunov	hi there - I am getting a strange error when running the shogun toolkit through the R modular interface. The toolkit and the interface seemed to compile without issue, but then when I run one of the test examples(mkl_multiclass_modular.R), I get the following error on the very last line of the script (out <- lab$get_labels())

 uzunov	Error in validObject(.Object) :   invalid class "_p_shogun__SGVectorT_double_t" object: invalid object for slot "ref" in class "_p_shogun__SGVectorT_double_t": got class "numeric", should\   be or extend class "externalptr
 uzunov	Anyone have an idea of what might be wrong? Maybe I did not install something properly? The rest of the script runs fine though. Any help is greatly appreaciated.

 Saurabh7	hey iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	hey Saurabh7
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, i am having issues with the mailing list
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, tell me, what issues?
 Saurabh7	not recieving mails even though i am subscribed
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, i even tried setting the options again
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, mmm, that's weird
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, so, you didn't receive any of the GSoC updates?
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, no
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, let me check for your user in the list of subscribers
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, i ended double posting too on new thread
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, yeah, I saw that
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, thats because  didnt recieve the first thread
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, and even the archives didn't show that on gmane
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, well, they do show now. Maybe there is just a delay in the archives?
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, yes but shouldn't i be recieving the mails?
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, i didn't get the meet up one too
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, i don't want to miss something else
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, what address did you use to subscribe?
 kislay	iglesiasg, me too. I never received a single mail till now. I keep checking the archives everyday..
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, my email : saurabh.mahindre@gmail.com
@iglesiasg	I see you are subscribed with this one
@iglesiasg	saurabh.mahindre@gmail.com
@iglesiasg	the spelling looks correct
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, there seems to be some issue then
@iglesiasg	you have a checkbox called ack with a tick, you seem to be the only one who has it
 Saurabh7	err, what might that be ?!
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, but I guess that is that you get an automatic response once you publish?
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, nope nothing, weird enough i don't get anything
 Saurabh7	kislay, is also not getting it seems
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, just in case -- I guess you checked already your spam folder
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, yup checked, no spam, no filters
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, you have the digest mode on as well
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, that would explain that you don't get every single mail once it is sent
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, but you should get a collection of them at least daily
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, nothing from the list so far , not even 1 mail
 kislay	same here.
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, hope i am not irritating you :)
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, it's ok
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, just wanted to inform you about it, maybe we can find a fix
@iglesiasg	kislay, what's the mail you subscribed with?
@iglesiasg	kislay, abhijeet.kislay.eee11@itbhu.ac.in?
 kislay	iglesiasg, yup
 kislay	iglesiasg, exactly!
@iglesiasg	kislay, this is the one you are subscribed with
@iglesiasg	kislay, abhijeet.kislay.eee11@itbhu.ac.in
@iglesiasg	kislay, the spelling looks all right to me, but please double check
 kislay	its correct
@iglesiasg	kislay, ok you also had the digest mode on
@iglesiasg	kislay, Saurabh7, so it might be related to this
 kislay	iglesiasg, but no mails so for
@iglesiasg	kislay, Saurabh7, I just turned off the digest mode for both of you
@iglesiasg	let me send a test mail to the mailing list and hope you guys will get
 kislay	yeah!
 Saurabh7	ok , !
@iglesiasg	Saurabh7, kislay let me know please
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, got it!
 Saurabh7	great!
 kislay	iglesiasg, awesome. got it
 Saurabh7	iglesiasg, thanks for fixing it, and sorry for double posting :)
@iglesiasg	happy to hear it is fixed now :)

 khalednasr	lambday, hey
 lambday	khalednasr: hey
 lambday	khalednasr: how's it going?
 khalednasr	lambday, good, you?
 lambday	khalednasr: just started with vector-sum thingi
 lambday	khalednasr: you know if there's a method in viennacl that computes sums of values?
 lambday	sum of all elements in vector I mean
 khalednasr	lambday, nope, they don't have a method for that :(
 lambday	khalednasr: I was afraid so... found till hell without any luck
 lambday	I'm using std::accumulate
 khalednasr	so you copy stuff back to the cpu?
 lambday	khalednasr: umm.. not sure what to do.. may be you have an idea? this won't work when vector loaded on gpu?
 khalednasr	lambday, it can be done with an custom opencl kernel
 lambday	khalednasr: alright! that's something I don't have any idea -
 lambday	khalednasr: so I'm just adding eigen3 here... may be you can add viennacl version when you have time/when you'll need it?
 khalednasr	lambday, yeah, I'm gonna need to implement it later on anyway
 lambday	khalednasr: cool!
 khalednasr	lambday, there's a problem that I ran into when I tried to do what we talked about last time
 khalednasr	lambday, https://gist.github.com/khalednasr/ae85d6d13fbe572e2bdc
 lambday	khalednasr: what is it?
 khalednasr	lambday, some compile error that I can't figure out
 lambday	khalednasr: checking
 lambday	khalednasr: argh - this is because in the specialization we're using a matrix type that cannot be matched with the generic one
 lambday	extra 2nd template arg -
 lambday	crap man
 khalednasr	it compiles as long as you don't try to call the function
 lambday	khalednasr: the only way I can imaigne is to use a proxy type
 lambday	really!
 lambday	may be because some crazy compiler optimization thing
 khalednasr	lambday, that's why I thought it worked, when we talked last time
 lambday	khalednasr: ah I see
 lambday	khalednasr: let me play with this a bit
 khalednasr	lambday, have fun :)
 lambday	khalednasr: but unless we use a fake type I don't see any other way we can handle it
 khalednasr	lambday, yeah probably
 khalednasr	lambday, we could write a SGMatrix-style wrapper around it
 lambday	khalednasr: no but wait! I misunderstood something
 lambday	this *should* work
 lambday	you're using VCLMatrix
 lambday	which has 2 template args
 khalednasr	yup
 lisitsyn	heyy
 khalednasr	hey
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, the gpu stuff is gonna take more time than I thought it would..
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: that's ok deadlines are for n00bs :D
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: what's in particular causing struggles?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, :D
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, viennacl matrices don't fit with the linalg library
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, they have different template arguments than SGMatrix and eigen3 matrix
 lisitsyn	different like?
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: ahh you mean they have different number of template arguments?
 khalednasr	template <class T, class F, unsigned int>
 lisitsyn	what's F for btw?
 khalednasr	row major vs column major
 lisitsyn	erhrr
 lisitsyn	I see
 lambday	lisitsyn: we managed this thing for vector with template <class Info, template<class,Info...> class Vector, class T, Info... info> if you remember
 lisitsyn	lambday: yeah
 lambday	lisitsyn: this fails for matrix for their f**king different template args for matrices :(
 lambday	lisitsyn: so khalednasr suggested that we should have two versions for row-majors and col-majors and fix the type
 lisitsyn	like a wrapper
 lisitsyn	that fixes the value
 lisitsyn	e.g. as row major
 lisitsyn	?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, yup, https://gist.github.com/khalednasr/ae85d6d13fbe572e2bdc
 lambday	lisitsyn: pretty much
 lisitsyn	ah these template aliases
 lisitsyn	I barely understand consequencies but it looks ok
 lisitsyn	do you see any drawbacks?
 khalednasr	except that it doesn't  work when you try to call the method :D
 khalednasr	it compiles as long as you don't try to use it
 lisitsyn	hahah
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, anyway, I started working on conv. nets, in parallel with the gpu stuff
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, gonna send a PR with some basic methods later today
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: yeah sounds good
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: lambday: I could try to come online a bit later to discuss it a bit more
 lisitsyn	may be we could come up with some solution
 lambday	lisitsyn: yep! since linalg is in its infancy, its easier for now to change things
