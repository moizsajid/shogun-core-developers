@sonney2k	wiking, hurray one buildbot works now now you only have to fix the rest :P
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, man what happened to libshogun's compile time? it is sth like 6 minutes now on my old machine (used to be ~1min)
@sonney2k	and that already is with 2 cores
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: have you noticed any particular file?
 lisitsyn	that is too slow I mean

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I am on battery currently so I cannot thoroughly test
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: well we now have a lot of eigen3 code
@sonney2k	now it would be cool if the buildbots compile time could somehow be plotted
@sonney2k	so we would see
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, might be just that
 lisitsyn	eigen3 is slow indeed, even simple code takes >30s I'd say
@sonney2k	still sucks big time
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: clang is much better in this btw
 lisitsyn	just to compare, travis compiles and tests tapkee in 6 minutes
 lisitsyn	with clang
@sonney2k	clang is too old here
 lisitsyn	and 19 minutes with gcc
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hmmh clang fails in 8 minutes g++ takes > 20
@sonney2k	but some unit tests fails hmmhh
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, how can one check the -Wfoo arguments with cmake?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I mean not specify them if they are not supported?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, is there some test in cmake for that?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I don't know any
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, how are the compiler flags checked
@sonney2k	?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what compile flags?

 lisitsyn	sonney2k: like C++11?
@sonney2k	yeah and march=native etc
@sonney2k	not all compilers have this
 lisitsyn	afaik there is no magic for that
 lisitsyn	you just code that in CMakeLists
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but how is the option checked? I mean we need this exact mechanism for warnings now too
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: for C++11 it just tries to compile some snippers
 lisitsyn	ts*
 lisitsyn	there is try_compile command in cmake
 lisitsyn	iirc
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok so the same we should do for warnings but with the flag -Werror
 lisitsyn	yes we can do that I think

 sonne|work	not available
@wiking	  error: could not find svn for checkout of GoogleMock
@wiking	so no svn ;)
@wiking	and how would u provide then the gmock/gtest?
 sonne|work	wiking: by path?
 sonne|work	it is available in $HOME/
 sonne|work	wiking: is it that difficult? I mean when you download you also have a custom path somewhere?
@wiking	sonne|work: no i mean how would u download it at the first place
 sonne|work	wiking: as admin on the machine
 sonne|work	wiking: btw could you please have a look at the other buildbots, bsd is unhappy too: http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1382/steps/configure/logs/stdio

 lambday_	sonne|work: yes just saw.. but got an error.. it didn't detect cblas I guess..
 lambday_	all undefined ref errors for cblas stuffs
 sonne|work	lambday_: better do a git clean -dfx  stop using configure/make but use cmake and show us the output somewhere
 lambday_	sonne|work: okay I'm trying..
 thoralf	sonne|work: Would it make sense to remove configure/make, so that nobody is tempted to use it?
 thoralf	sonne|work: The old files are still in the history, so we don't lose anything.
 sonne|work	thoralf: if we could compile static interfaces yes!
 sonne|work	thoralf: currently we dont' have that in cmake ...
 thoralf	sonne|work: Did not know that.  Thanks for updating. ;)
 lambday_	sonne|work: wiking: did a git clean -dfx, then cmake and make, this is what I get https://gist.github.com/lambday/6211595
 sonne|work	lambday_: maybe you need to a LD_LIBRARY_PATH or put /usr/lib64/atlas in /etc/ld.so.conf*
 lambday_	sonne|work: alright.. trying... but with configure it didn't complain about this
 lambday_	sonne|work: /etc/ld.so.conf.d/atlas-x86_64.conf is already there, with /usr/lib64/atlas
 lambday_	this is a new machine, so may be I forgot to set up somethng :-/
@wiking	sonne|work: if i change the master.cfg do i have to -HUP or restart the bot?

@sonney2k	I suspect it is not being linked against cblas

@sonney2k	lambday, you don't happen to have the full log? This one is not helping. I need the line where libshogun is linked
 lambday	this should use -L/usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so instead of -llapack
 lambday	sonney2k: yes alright I am posting
@sonney2k	lambday, might be another issue but it currently doesn't find symbols that are in cblas.so
 lambday	-llapack picks the /usr/lib64/liblapack.so instead of /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so
 lambday	sonney2k: I am pasitng the full log
 lambday	sonney2k: https://gist.github.com/lambday/6211595, full-log.log
 lambday	its not full but might be helpful, full is too big
@sonney2k	wiking, it indeed is just missing -lcblas
@sonney2k	wiking, it has -llapack and -lblas but -lcblas is  missing
@wiking	sonney2k: #TODO: write ATLAS detection
@sonney2k	wiking, not atlas - cblas
@wiking	sonney2k: ok then what i should detect since it seeems
@wiking	that FindBLAS.cmake that comes with cmake
@wiking	does something wrong
@wiking	or that our MACRO tests for cblas is not the best...
@sonney2k	wiking, the way I handled it with configure was to check if lapack, blas / cblas where found then enable HAVE_* stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, no blas != cblas
@sonney2k	wiking, this needs some extra checks for the cblas functions

 van51	sonney2k: I believe it solves the issue I was having with the multiple threads
 van51	sonney2k: at least when I changed the int32_t refcount to atomic int in those classes, temporarily, it worked

@sonney2k	van51, ohh f...!
@sonney2k	van51, you could be right
@sonney2k	indeed io objects are not thread safe etc
@sonney2k	van51, but where is this done in parallel?
 van51	sonney2k: from what I understand it's a problem in my dense_dot method because I'm creating and destroying multiple shogun objects that call CSGObject() and ~CSGObject() in parallel
 van51	sonney2k: here are some helgrind outputs that show some race conditions : http://pastebin.com/tMYjpKn2

@sonney2k	yeah...
@sonney2k	it always is

@sonney2k	me neither
 lisitsyn	no sometimes you find a bug and it finds a bug in a glitch of a bug
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: how to fix it?
 van51	it needs a bit more work in that commit because it's not compiling as is
 van51	and I g2g in a bit
 van51	I'll send a PR tonight though that you can comment and review :)
@sonney2k	wiking, I am totally lost with cmake ATM
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what's it?
 lisitsyn	anything particular?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, cblas  / atlas detection doesn't work
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so it fails to compile on iglesiasg & lambday's machine
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, then the -Wwarnme stuff should be disabled with clang
@wiking	sonney2k: no the warnme should not be as it's now fixed
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and we need static interfaces back

@sonney2k	wiking, well so the issue is still there since we want these warnings

@wiking	no

@wiking	for clang
@wiking	as there's quite some optimization flags that are not supported in clang
@wiking	hence i've removed those
@wiking	so we won't have those errors
@wiking	and wtf is this: lapack+atlas+cblas
@sonney2k	wiking, but with gcc we still have them then right?
@wiking	sonney2k: yes with gcc yes
@sonney2k	ok
@wiking	lapack needs blas
@wiking	and for that there's a cmake test
@wiking	but that has nothing to do with cblas
 lisitsyn	wiking: oob, right?
@wiking	and currently in our code we say
@wiking	HAVE_LAPACK -> cblas
@wiking	lisitsyn: ?
@sonney2k	wiking, exactly
 lisitsyn	wiking: out of the box I mean
@wiking	no
 lisitsyn	wiking: do we have our own?
@wiking	why HAVE_LAPACK means that we have cblas
@wiking	lisitsyn: nono it's cmake default module
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes that's what I meant
@wiking	having lapack is one thing... but then we should not call it fucking HAVE_LAPACK
@sonney2k	wiking, because    no one wants to write .h files for blas
@wiking	we should call it HAVE_CBLAS
@wiking	and that's it
@sonney2k	wiking, then you pretend something would be working with cblas not available
 lisitsyn	git grep HAVE_LAPACK | wc -l
 lisitsyn	195

 iglesiasg_	so basically do mkdir build in your root shogun directory
 iglesiasg_	cd build
 iglesiasg_	cmake ..
 iglesiasg_	make
 iglesiasg_	the last make can be as your usual one
 iglesiasg_	make -j2
 iglesiasg_	ccache make -j2
 iglesiasg_	actually this cmake is supposed to do ccache automatically, but it doesn't detect fine for me
 iglesiasg_	so I do it manually like that
@wiking	ok bsd bot is fixed
@wiking	lisitsyn: no... all off
 gsomix_	iglesiasg_, thanks!
 lisitsyn	wiking: gotit
 gsomix_	compiling
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, now if you want to configure some things like  the ones we could do with configure script, say ./configure --disable-optimization --interfaces= etc
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, you can pass this kind of parameters to cmake ..
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, but I suggest you to use ccmake .. and customize it using the ncurses gui
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg_: I think I should document it with some priority to ccmake
 lisitsyn	what do you think?
 iglesiasg_	lisitsyn, it sounds like a good idea
 iglesiasg_	lisitsyn, say something about ccmake or cmake gui
 iglesiasg_	lisitsyn, so people know about eh options
 lisitsyn	yes I put some words on it
 iglesiasg_	lisitsyn, I think that if you basically say use ccmake is enough
 lisitsyn	yeah
 iglesiasg_	I mean, ccmake then gives you all the info

 pickle27	iglesiasg_: how do I commit to shogun-data
 pickle27	can I do it at the same time as commiting to the main branch
 lisitsyn	pickle27: no
@wiking	iglesiasg_: can u copy-paste here the #define LINKFLAGS line from your ./src/shogun/lib/config.h
 lisitsyn	pickle27: first data then update data repo reference
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay do I make a separate commit from inside data
 iglesiasg_	pickle27, I think it should work in the same way, just make a pull request and so on
 pickle27	oh okay

 iglesiasg_	wiking, ^
 gsomix_	iglesiasg_, so "Debug" CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is something  "--disable-optimization", right?
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, exactly
 gsomix_	what about doxygen?
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, toggle to advanced mode with t
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, use / to search
 gsomix_	ow
 gsomix_	*wow
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, like /Doxygen
 iglesiasg_	gsomix_, I don't actually see any disable doxygen though :D
@wiking	iglesiasg_: this is the latest?!
 iglesiasg_	wiking, does that exist?
 iglesiasg_	wiking, Add FindCBlas is latest commit here
@wiking	iglesiasg_: and have u reran a clean cmake?
 iglesiasg_	it was lates less than 30 minutes ago for sure :D
 iglesiasg_	wiking, let me try
 iglesiasg_	wiking, not sure
 iglesiasg_	wiking, rm -rf build is enough, right?

@iglesiasg	maybe it is something trivial
@iglesiasg	wiking, eeeh ok interesting

@iglesiasg	they look similar to the ones before I think
@wiking	iglesiasg: yes
@wiking	in the same file
@wiking	HAVE_LAPACK is defined?
@wiking	or it's undef?
