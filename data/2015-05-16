@lambday	besser82: hey
@lambday	besser82: today after I did a regular yum update, my f21 isn't booting up.. could you please help me with that?
@besser82	lambday, sure
@besser82	lambday, what's the error you get?
@lambday	besser82: well, a bunch of services didn't start... fedora-import-state.service, systemd-logind.service
@lambday	I tried booting into rescue mode with root, tried yum history undo last... didn't work due to no network
@besser82	lambday, ahh I see...  looks like some trouble with SELinux, I suppose...
@besser82	lambday, boot into rescue and `touch /.autorelabel`
@lambday	besser82: okay trying that
@besser82	lambday, then reboot as usual and see if it works then  ;)
@besser82	lambday, will restore all SELinux-contexts and will do an automated-reboot after on
@lambday	okay I'm trying
@lambday	besser82: so .autorelebel shoud be in /root ?
@besser82	lambday, not in /root
@besser82	lambday, directly in /
@besser82	lambday, /.autorelabel
@lambday	ok
@besser82	lambday, shall be an empty file, 0-size
@lambday	besser82: okay.. rebooting now
@besser82	lambday, okie
@lambday	besser82: it rebooted again but then I'm getting same errors
@lambday	fedora-import-state
@lambday	logind
@besser82	lambday, mhh...  then go into rescue and do `systemctl start network`
@lambday	failed accounts-daemon.service
@besser82	lambday, after on you can do `yum history undo last`
@lambday	besser82: okay.. trying
@besser82	lambday,`systemctl start network` shall bring up networking
@lambday	besser82: well, after I did that, it sent me back to root login prompt
@lambday	besser82: ifconfig doesn't show wlan
@besser82	lambday, did you login again?
@lambday	besser82: yes
@besser82	okay...
@besser82	can you use ethernet instead?
@besser82	lambday, ^
@lambday	besser82: umm.. ya.. then this connection will be lost :D
@lambday	besser82: let me try and I'll come back after that
@besser82	Ahh... I see...  :(
@besser82	or that way  ;)
@besser82	okie...  see ya in 5 minutes or so

@lambday	besser82: hey.. no that too didn't work
@lambday	btw it's actually emergency mode..
@lambday	besser82: that's different from rescue?
@besser82	lambday, no afaik
@besser82	lambday, did you bring up your lan-connection, btw?
@lambday	besser82: umm I did systemctl start network
@lambday	nothing more
@besser82	lambday, that neccessarily doesn't mean the connection is brought up...
@lambday	besser82: okay there was some ifconfig commands, right
@besser82	lambday, yes or wait... lemme check...
@besser82	lambday, inside /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
@besser82	lambday, there are your lan-connections
@besser82	lambday, look for your Wifi
@besser82	lambday, and edit the file
@lambday	besser82: okay
@besser82	lambday, there is a line "onboot="
@besser82	lambday, make it read "onboot=yes"
@besser82	then reboot and `systemctl start network-online`
@lambday	besser82: it's already set onboot=yes
@besser82	lambday, then reboot and `systemctl start network-online`  :P
@besser82	lambday, shall bring up all onboot ifs
@lambday	besser82: aah failed to start network-online.service, Unit network-online.service failed to load : no such file or directory
@besser82	lambday, then reboot and `systemctl start Networking`
@besser82	lambday, `systemctl start Networking`
@besser82	lambday, or get a Fedora 21 Live image...
@besser82	lambday, and I'll give you the commands to mount and rollback your system  ;)
@lambday	besser82: yeah I downloaded that...created a liveusb with liveusb creator .. but when I booted using that it was giving some weird errors that I haven't seen before
@lambday	besser82: Netorking failed too
@lambday	live image
@besser82	lambday, just dd it to the stick  ...
@besser82	lambday, that should be fail-proof
@besser82	dd if=live.iso of=/dev/my_stick bs=4M
@lambday	besser82: ah there's the issue.. this machine runs Windows :|
@lambday	from which I can create it
@besser82	lambday, i see...
@besser82	lambday, http://www.chrysocome.net/dd   :D
@lambday	besser82: hehe okay trying this
@besser82	lambday, allrighty ^^
@lambday	besser82: hey.. booted using liveusb

@lambday	besser82_ hey
-!- besser82 was kicked from #shogun by besser82_ [besser82]
@besser82_	lambday, yes?
@lambday	besser82_: booted using livecd
@besser82_	lambday, allrighty
@besser82_	lambday, network up?
@besser82_	lambday, terminal ready?
@lambday	besser82_: network not ready
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: witness
@besser82_	lambday, what's the beef?
@lambday	besser82_: done
@lambday	besser82_: everything up
@besser82_	lambday, allrighty  ^^
@besser82_	lambday, sudo -i on terminal
@lambday	ok
@besser82_	lambday, mkdir -p /chroot
@lambday	besser82_: ok
@besser82_	lambday, mount $your_drive /chroot
@besser82_	lambday, then mount all parts as needed inside the hierarchie of /choot
@besser82_	lambday, so that your systems' /home, /usr, /var, etc. are mounted within /chroot
-!- witness [uid10044@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-wyjhihkontqechhq] has joined #shogun
@lambday	besser82_: everything needs to be mounted?
@besser82_	lambday, yes
@besser82_	lambday, starting with root partition in /chroot
@besser82_	lambday, then all other partitions of your sys
@lambday	besser82_: okay
@lambday	besser82_: okay I have 3... root, home, usr
@lambday	mounted at /chroot, /chroot/home, /chroot/usr
@besser82_	lambday, fine :D
@besser82_	then let's go
@besser82_	yum --installroot="/chroot" history undo last
@besser82_	lambday, ^
@lambday	besser82_: working :D
@besser82_	sweet :D
@lambday	fingers crossed until next reboot
@besser82_	lambday, dont forget to `sync`
@lambday	besser82_: sync? ah I rebooted already
@besser82_	lambday, and works?
@lambday	besser82_: nope
@besser82_	lambday, make sure to relabel...
@besser82_	lambday, SELinux-contexts are messed-up now...
@besser82_	lambday, touch /.autorelabel
@besser82_	lambday, and reboot...
@besser82_	lambday, then let's see...
@lambday	besser82_: booted finally.. :D .. the last update included a kernel update as well.. when I tried with the previous one it worked
@lambday	besser82_: thanks man! :D
@besser82_	lambday, np...  your welcome  :D
@lambday	besser82_: where is the grub entries from where I can remove the new kernel in the menu?
@besser82_	lambday, just remove the affected kernel version...
@besser82_	lambday, otherwise there is /boot/grub.cfg
@lambday	besser82_: you mean just rm the vmlinuz image ? that would work?
@besser82_	lambday, nope
@besser82_	lambday, with yum
@lambday	besser82_: ok
@besser82_	lambday, like yum erase kernel-%{version}-%{release}
@lambday	besser82_: okay.. it's already removed :) just gotta delete the grub entry
@besser82_	lambday, that should've been done automatically
@lambday	besser82_: I mean in the yum repo it doesn't show.. but in /boot the images are still there
@besser82_	lambday, a it see...
@besser82_	lambday, the just edit /boot/grub.cfg
@besser82_	or /boot/grub/grub.cfg
@lambday	besser82_: done! works :)
@besser82_	fine ^^

@lambday	besser82_: what was that sync thing that you said? should I do that?
@besser82_	lambday, just precaution...  `sync` actually tells the fs to write out the cache / buffer to disk
-!- besser82_ is now known as besser82
@lambday	besser82_: okay
@besser82	so it's nothing really special
@besser82	just some habbit of me, to be sure all is flushed before shutting down  :P
@lambday	besser82: hehe :D
