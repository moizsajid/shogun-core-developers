 sanuj	lisitsyn, there?
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	lisitsyn, https://gist.github.com/sanuj/56f03cd242473137fad851e68fa0f2c1
 sanuj	wiking, ^
 sanuj	list of abstract classes from shogun
 sanuj	i grepped for "()=0" and "() = 0"
 sanuj	i have made a markdown so we can decide which classes to keep in base shogun
 sanuj	i will convert into swig interface afterwards
 lisitsyn	but what about virtual functions *with* arguments?
 sanuj	heiko also wanted to make some classifications for these classes
 sanuj	some tree
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	i'll add those
 sanuj	i missed them
 lisitsyn	its like (.*) = 0
 lisitsyn	or something
 lisitsyn	and there also can be const
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	virtual f(int a) const = 0;
 sanuj	i see
 sanuj	will try these
 sanuj	oh lots of classes need to be added then
 sanuj	lisitsyn, check it later then
 sanuj	i'll ping you when i've added all of them
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	cool
 sanuj	lisitsyn,  should i grep for anything else?
@wiking	hello hello
 lisitsyn	hey
@wiking	where is heiko?:)
 lisitsyn	sanuj: probably no
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	lisitsyn: do you have an answer
@wiking	for that email on the mailing list
 lisitsyn	there should be virtual and ()
@wiking	what's the diff between
 lisitsyn	wiking: basemulticlass?
@wiking	yes
 lisitsyn	let me check
 sanuj	wiking, you are talking about the thing that i asked you earlier
 sanuj	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: for some reason
 lisitsyn	e.g. TreeMachine is not MulticlassMachine
 lisitsyn	but BaseMulticlassMachine
 lisitsyn	I guess it was too limitedt

 sanuj	there are too many classes in shogun
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do i also include classes from lib/* for shogun-base?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: like?
 sanuj	tapkee
 sanuj	lib/external/*
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ah no
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: they are used by converters/

 sanuj	https://gist.github.com/sanuj/56f03cd242473137fad851e68fa0f2c1
 sanuj	updated
 sanuj	lisitsyn, if you think it's okay then we can tell others and refactor this list

 lisitsyn	sanuj: ok lets divide and conquer
 lisitsyn	sanuj: could you put things we are sure
 lisitsyn	into another list there
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i'll make another gist for that then
 sanuj	what are we sure about
 sanuj	the things you mentioned in your comment?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: you can start with my first comment
 sanuj	lisitsyn, cool
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i hope this list is not a waste then :)
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I think it is better to put them there
 lisitsyn	just moving them from one list to another
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	to keep all of them at the same place
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so all kernels and distances from my list
 sanuj	and so on

 sanuj	lisitsyn, do you want CRandomKitchenSinksDotFeatures also in the other list?
 lisitsyn	no
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	that's just dot features
 sanuj	densefeatures and sparsefeatures are not abstract classes
 sanuj	but derived from dotfeatures
 sanuj	lisitsyn, ^
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes
 lisitsyn	that's an exception
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	as they are really important
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do you want all abstract class distances?
 sanuj	realdistance
 sanuj	stringdistance
 sanuj	sparsedistance
 lisitsyn	sanuj: looks like
 lisitsyn	not sure though
 lisitsyn	sanuj: lets keep just base distance
 lisitsyn	it looks like string/sparse/real is just a notion of features they are defined
 sanuj	i.e. CDistance?
 lisitsyn	on
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn,  do we need to confirm this with others?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah it could be good to discuss that
 sanuj	HeikoS, wiking ping
 lisitsyn	it's really a major change
@HeikoS	sanuj: jojo
@HeikoS	wiking: checking
 sanuj	HeikoS, all abstract classes --> https://gist.github.com/sanuj/56f03cd242473137fad851e68fa0f2c1
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	cool checking
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ^?
 sanuj	saw
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes I know
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what is a major change?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well defining base classes
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	it determines everything
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	we need a class diagram
@HeikoS	a list is not very intuitive :)
@HeikoS	you know dia?
 sanuj	no
 lisitsyn	graphviz is ok as well
@HeikoS	lambday used that for his crazy hierarchy in gsoc a few years agp
 sanuj	i'll have a look at them
@HeikoS	sanuj, lisitsyn I think this should be approached differently
@HeikoS	too many details right now
@HeikoS	what are the base classes and their interfaces?
@HeikoS	this is most important
@HeikoS	for that, we need to write down algorithm classes
@HeikoS	then, and only then, we can try to fit existing things in there
@HeikoS	and iterate
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: my idea is to make a few iterations to select classes we are sure about
@HeikoS	I think this leads to bad design
@HeikoS	as we are biased by the current class structure which is a disaster
@HeikoS	the old CMachine interface for supervised learning is good,
@HeikoS	but thats all thats good
@HeikoS	so rather think from algorithm classes
@HeikoS	not concrete algorithms
@HeikoS	I am missing:
@HeikoS	CSupervisedLearning
@HeikoS	CUnsupervisedLearning
 lisitsyn	Semisupervised? :)
@HeikoS	where the first has fit(X,y), the second only has fit(X)
 sanuj	HeikoS, that's what your comment is about on the gist
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: would you go
 lisitsyn	for fit/predict
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: dont care
 lisitsyn	the sklearn gold standard?
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	fit, apply
@HeikoS	train, apply
 lisitsyn	fit predict
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	fit, predict
@HeikoS	I dont catre
 sanuj	train predict sounds good :P
 lisitsyn	it goes against default names
@HeikoS	sanuj: but do you get what I mean when I say start general
 lisitsyn	not good
@HeikoS	not with classes that exist
 sanuj	HeikoS, yes i do
@HeikoS	I mean things like variational likelihood
@HeikoS	no point in even thinking about this thing
@HeikoS	way to specific
@HeikoS	more important to think about the interface of a GP
 sanuj	this will be a part of a plugin
@HeikoS	different ways it can be used in
@HeikoS	Or even CLikelihoodModel
@HeikoS	the core things to get right are:
@HeikoS	supervised/unsupervised and some subclasses (not concrete algorithms yet)
@HeikoS	and the features
 sanuj	reinforcement?
@HeikoS	we dont have that
@HeikoS	then pick a single representative algo, and try to put it under the framework
@HeikoS	draw class diagram examples
@HeikoS	with the method signatures (not too detailed)
@HeikoS	Careful interface design
@HeikoS	thinking of what users might want to do, keep it clean
@HeikoS	etc etc
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	The main one is CMachine for supervised learning
@HeikoS	(should be renamed)
@HeikoS	the list I wrote in the comment is a pretty good start btw
@HeikoS	what would be the interfaces for these classes
 sanuj	cool, i'll start from there
@HeikoS	sanuj: great!
 sanuj	and then put the existing shogun algorithms in the correct category
@HeikoS	sanuj: can we discuss this over a diagram?
@HeikoS	can you make one in some online editor?
@HeikoS	sanuj: yes then that
@HeikoS	sanuj: and I would aim for rather fewer algorithms at the start, but a really good interface
@HeikoS	and then add things later
 sanuj	HeikoS, alright
 sanuj	i
 sanuj	i'll make a diagram and share that with you soon
 sanuj	by tomorrow
@HeikoS	sanuj: great!
@HeikoS	looking forward to see it
@HeikoS	this is a very fun part of the project
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	cool
