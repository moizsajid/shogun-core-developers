 sonne|work	(makes only sense if it was not of course)
 hushell	sonne|work: Thanks! I just checked the doc: if (x) { if ((x)->unref()==0) (x)=NULL;
 hushell	I should do this before :)

 gsomix	hello
 gsomix	one more exam is passed
 gsomix	so, there is only one now
 gsomix	sonne|work: sonney2k hey, glad to see you. :)
 sonne|work	hey
 sonne|work	gsomix: when is you last one?
 gsomix	sonne|work: 27 June, state exam
 gsomix	and then full-time job at shogun
 sonne|work	yay!
 sonne|work	gsomix: so until then you have no time I guess?
 gsomix	sonne|work: yep :(
 sonne|work	gsomix: then good luck but don't forget you weekly report (today!) though!

@iglesiasg	C++ question
@iglesiasg	when does it actually matter to use a const return value?
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-408350.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
 van51	hello
 sonne|work	hey van51!
 sonne|work	how is it going?
 van51	sonne|work: hey!
 van51	sonne|work: it's going ok :)
 sonne|work	ohh and I hope you can do the language text example too. for the image one we already have some matlab code that porting won't need much time
 van51	sonne|work: I wanted to ask you
 van51	sonne|work: you mean the language detection?
 sonne|work	yeah
 van51	ok
 van51	sonne|work: are you going to remove the SGString ?
 van51	sonne|work: and the StringFeatures?
 sonne|work	that should be rather easy to do. just n-grams and fetch ascii based languages from wikipedia for a few thousand articles
 sonne|work	yes SGVector it will be
 sonne|work	StingFeatures will stay of course
 van51	sonne|work: I was thinking of moving the tokenization to an earlier stage of the pipeline
 van51	and instead of storing the documents in stringfeatures and having to tokenize them when they are needed
 van51	I was thinking of storing a list of tokens
 van51	or a list of SGVectors
 van51	for each document
 van51	sonne|work: what do you think?
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.3] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 van51	also I think that the current way will be easier to be extended to streamed features
 van51	sorry if I'm being overwhelming :)
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: hey there
 lisitsyn	votjakovr: van51: gsomix: pickle27: weekly reports please ;)
@iglesiasg	and me too!
@iglesiasg	:)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: oops sorry missed you
@iglesiasg	hehe no problem
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: as for your question
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: btw enlighten me
@iglesiasg	yeah I was going to ask you about it right now :)
 lisitsyn	const return value is useless
 lisitsyn	I don't see any case
@iglesiasg	you sure?
 lisitsyn	like
 lisitsyn	const Object f();?
 lisitsyn	makes no sense to me at all
 lisitsyn	const Object& would be something more interesting
@iglesiasg	and const Object* as well I guess
 lisitsyn	though that's dangerous and should be avoided
 lisitsyn	const Object* or const Object* const yes
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: if you return by value just use value type
 lisitsyn	I don't know any case when you restrict new object to be const
 lisitsyn	that's the user preference to make it const
@iglesiasg	the concepts of return by value and return by reference I understand
@iglesiasg	BTW I started wondering because of https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1185/files#L10R66
@iglesiasg	the two get_features methods there
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hmm they are const
 lisitsyn	not the return value
@iglesiasg	the first return value is const
 lisitsyn	ahhh
@iglesiasg	cons CFeatures*
 lisitsyn	const CFeatures*
 lisitsyn	that's constant pointer
@iglesiasg	yeah
 lisitsyn	like we can't change where it points to
@iglesiasg	pointer to constant rather?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no that's CFeatures* const
@iglesiasg	mmm let me test it out
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: const char* - you can't change the pointer but you can change the string
 lisitsyn	const char* const
 lisitsyn	you can't change anything
 lisitsyn	char* const - you can't change contents but you are free to move the pointer around
@iglesiasg	I think it is the other way round
 van51	how detailed must this weekly report be?
@iglesiasg	char* const you can change pointer but no contents
@iglesiasg	van51: like the ones they have already sent are quite fine I think
 van51	iglesiasg: I'm almost done, but now that I read it, I'm thinking that someone not familiar with the project will probably not follow :(
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: http://pastebin.com/XK4sud5D
@iglesiasg	van51: aham I understand
@iglesiasg	van51: it should be something short that summarizes what you have done
@iglesiasg	so for instance Shell's description I think is fine in length
@iglesiasg	but it is difficult to define what the right length is
@iglesiasg	it should be something not time consuming at all
@iglesiasg	or at least that's the idea :) hehe
@iglesiasg	van51: in any case, if you are done with the one for this week just send it around. Do not worry about improving it or so
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes it is what I said :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: haha ok, I misunderstood :)
 van51	ok sent it
 van51	iglesiasg: thanks :)
 van51	btw I'm getting an error when I use the ALPHANUM alphabet
 van51	[ERROR] bool shogun::CAlphabet::check_alphabet(bool): ALPHABET does not contain all symbols in histogram
 van51	but all I use are letters :/
 van51	any ideas?
@iglesiasg	van51: what letters are you using?
 van51	iglesiasg: upper case latin letters
@iglesiasg	I have never used that code but I recall from some mail something like only C,A and another letter should be used
@iglesiasg	but I am not sure at all, just recall that from some mail, it could be regarding another class though
 van51	iglesiasg: I think that's when you use the dna alphabet
@iglesiasg	it makes sense
 lisitsyn	van51: check for \n and etc
 van51	iglesiasg: I'm probably using something wrong
 lisitsyn	EOL EOF
 van51	ok solved it, turns out I had a larger length value in the SGString than I should
 van51	any easy way to have it accept spaces as well now? :)

 sonne|work	van51: if you can make the error message more meaningful please do it
 sonne|work	van51: I am jsut not able to. it is ment to say that you have some symbols in your input that are not in the alphabet
 sonne|work	and if you enable debug you would see the sysmbold
 sonne|work	s
 sonne|work	van51: sry was out for lunch.
 van51	sonne|work: no worries
 sonne|work	van51: when you don't have string features it makes IMHO already most sense to directly compute the hashed representation
 van51	sonne|work: about that error, I fixed it
 sonne|work	well a better error message is something you could help with
 sonne|work	van51: so just write the converter string -> hashed n gram word features
 sonne|work	actually it is string -> sparse features with hashes as indices
 van51	sonne|work: yeah, that is what I have done
 van51	sonne|work: I'm just wondering what would be better
 van51	to tokenize the string once in the beginning, or on-the-fly as weel
 van51	or do you mean already a token by string and not a document?
-!- nube [~rho@49.244.46.85] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	van51: it depends what inputs you have: in the online / streaming case it makes sense to tokenize on-the-fly & do the hashing
 sonne|work	if you have the whole set of strings already then you do the tokenize&hash pass
 sonne|work	in one go later
 sonne|work	both make sense and have their use case
-!- nube [~rho@49.244.46.85] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 van51	sonne|work: yes indeed. well, right now I tokenize and hash on-the-fly when the strings fit in memory
 van51	should I change it?
 sonne|work	I didn't git it
 sonne|work	get
 sonne|work	you have the whole strings in memory
 sonne|work	and then you do the tokenize & hashing in one go right?
 van51	sonne|work: well there is this possibility through the converter
 van51	but the HashedDocDotFeatures, maintain the documents as a CStringFeatures object
 van51	and whenever a dot product is needed, is tokenizes and hashes on the fly
 sonne|work	totally OK!
 sonne|work	the other other option is doing the same via the converter as you said
 van51	sonne|work: should I make a PR so you can review it as I progress ?
 van51	or Olivier,Benoit or Quoc
 sonne|work	van51: sure! I prefer small snacks anyway
 sonne|work	so if you have one small part working I would rather merge that already before you do the big thing in one go
 van51	sonne|work: ok, let me change the commit a bit first then
-!- iglesiasg [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 van51	on another note, if I want an alphabet that accepts spaces as well, I have to create a new EAlphabet type?
 sonne|work	van51: jsut use RAWBYTE

 sonne|work	hey foulwall!
 foulwall	hey sonne|work
 sonne|work	did you finish your exams?
 sonne|work	van51: np
 foulwall	sonne|work: yes~
 sonne|work	all good?
 foulwall	sonne|work: yeah
 foulwall	1. integrate the  data to the exisiting demos. (regression, clustering)
 foulwall	2. merge the exisiting binary/multiclass classification demo into the framework.
 foulwall	3. refractor the javascripts.
 foulwall	4. find a better way to draw heatmap with contour.
 foulwall	sonne|work: I planed to do these things this week.
 sonne|work	foulwall: excellent plan!
 sonne|work	let me know if you have questions / get stuck
 sonne|work	foulwall: btw I started setting up a machine for you where you can run the demos...
 sonne|work	not sure if internet access is fast for you (machine is in some data centre in berlin)
 foulwall	sonne|work: wow
 sonne|work	well it is just some (not so fast) virtual machine I did rent.
 foulwall	sonne|work: that's alright.
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: do you want to rent other machine?
 lisitsyn	digital ocean is pretty low-cost
 lisitsyn	tapkee website runs there
 lisitsyn	5$ / month
 sonne|work	no I have this machine for 3 months still and I am planning to cancel the contract past gsoc so all good

@sonney2k	wiking, new bugs: ../shogun/mathematics/Random.h:86: warning: integer constant is too large for 'long' type
@sonney2k	and /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.5/include/emmintrin.h:32:3: error: #error "SSE2 instruction set not enabled"
@sonney2k	In file included from ../shogun/lib/external/SFMT/SFMT.h:84,
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm
@sonney2k	wiking, let me try to fix the random +86 one
@sonney2k	return random_64() & ((uint64_t(-1)<<1)>>1); does the same and makes the compiler happy
@sonney2k	wiking, so now we need to fix the SSE2 one still
@sonney2k	wiking, ohh and please upgrade json-c on the fbsd machine to v 0.11

@sonney2k	wiking, the sse2 issue
@sonney2k	I cannot make sense of it
@wiking	sonney2k: ah stupid ./configure
@wiking	:)
@wiking	we should finish cmake :PPP
@sonney2k	just do it then though this is somehting subtle
@sonney2k	I figured that gcc -msse2 will define __SSE2__ 1
@sonney2k	which we did not do
@sonney2k	but then even with -msse2 it still doesn't work
@wiking	this is only with gcc i guess
@sonney2k	gcc & ooold debian 6.0
@wiking	aaah
@wiking	ok
@sonney2k	and i686
@wiking	what's the gcc version?
