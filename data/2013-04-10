 blackburn	so is DRPK going to have a party?
 harpreet	Hi, I was interested in the 'Develop interactive machine learning demos' for GSoc.
 harpreet	Any advice on what sort of work I should do before I apply?
 blackburn	harpreet: this was answered quite a few times on the mailing list - consider starting to contribute with small patches
 harpreet	Since the project is almost entirely concerned with Python, Django, JS, should I submit patches for the core C++ code or something else?
 medeeiip	yesterday I asked about development of a CMakelist. So working under windows is possible.... I did wrote the whole cmake list but the problem is compiler is complaining about a lot of things.... like e.g pthread...
 medeeiip	can pthread be made optional?
 medeeiip	the compiler is complaining about dirent.h too (as that is not available on windows)
 medeeiip	is there any more additional dependencies too ( one was with sys/types.h but I made that inclusion optional using #ifdef _WIN32 .....#else...code)
 blackburn	harpreet: no that's not that required to have C++ patches - any examples using python would work too
 blackburn	medeeiip: yes pthread is optional
 blackburn	medeeiip: that would be very helpful to fix these includes
 medeeiip	can you tell me where and how dirent.h is used ( I mean I can see where, actually how?)
 medeeiip	i mean not specifically
 medeeiip	but to give me an idea
 blackburn	medeeiip: it is used to find files IIRC
 medeeiip	so if i need to replace that dependency I need to do the same thing on windows in a alternative way....
 blackburn	yes probably
 medeeiip	is there any available list about what feature is optional and what is required?
 blackburn	feature of?
 medeeiip	i mean optional components like (pthread as you said).... specifically what library is required and what is optional?
 blackburn	ahh no I don't think we have a list
 blackburn	basically it should compile always
 medeeiip	it is directly complaining about pthread.....
 blackburn	medeeiip: all pthreads code should be guarded with preprocessor
 blackburn	so that's a bug
 medeeiip	no no.... hold a sec .... as confg.h generation was not automated i created a config.h where I used #define HAVE_PTHREAD 1
 medeeiip	let me check if it works without it.
 medeeiip	an idiot i am....:D
 blackburn	medeeiip: yeah HAVE_PTHREAD should not be set if you don't have it
 medeeiip	what is lbfgsfloatval_t datatype?
 medeeiip	in optimization_libfgs.cpp
 blackburn	medeeiip: what kind of answer do you expect? ;)
 medeeiip	from what library it is?
 blackburn	lbfgs
 medeeiip	'n that is?
 medeeiip	BFGS method?
 medeeiip	lib for that?
 blackburn	limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	medeeiip: it is incldued to the sources
 medeeiip	but lbfgsfloatval_t is not defined in lbfgs.h
 blackburn	medeeiip: where is it used?
 medeeiip	shogun\examples\undocumented\libshogun\optimization_lbfgs.cpp
 medeeiip	example though.....
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	it might be it wasn't properly updated
 blackburn	have to sleep now
 medeeiip	it's night at ur country
 medeeiip	???????
 blackburn	medeeiip: yes deep night slowly becoming a morning
 medeeiip	same in india...... but
 medeeiip	u 'r from germany ?
 medeeiip	isn't it?
 blackburn	no, russia
 blackburn	it is sonney2k who is from berlin
 medeeiip	i see.....
 medeeiip	btw good nite
 medeeiip	i too need a sleep badly....... tomorrow i've college
 blackburn	nite

@sonney2k	blackburn, muhaaaahaa you do boosting now :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: is the code crappy?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea - but this reminds me of my multiboost endeavour
@sonney2k	and I guess their code is massive - they have won a couple of competitions with that
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not know what to answer to last message
 blackburn	:D

 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	*MUUUUUAUAUAAAAAAHHHH*
 blackburn	sonne|work: is adaboost-reg really that cool?
 blackburn	I am quite surprised they got back to 2001 paper
 sonne|work	blackburn: it certainly is a reasonable method
 sonne|work	like any other method of course
 blackburn	sonne|work: what I do not get - do they have C++ impl of their adaboost?
 sonne|work	blackburn: "they"?
 blackburn	sonne|work: or him - whatever :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: he said 'they' are limited with time

 sonne|work	blackburn: I don't know whom you mean
 blackburn	sonne|work: roni
 sonne|work	ahh so not the multiboost guys
 sonne|work	well adaboost needs early stopping (or it will overfit)
 sonne|work	or some kind of regularization
 sonne|work	and of course it sucks to have too many baselearners in the end
 sonne|work	(slow when using it)
 n4nd0	adaboost doesn't overfit (or so said my professor always)
 sonne|work	haha
 sonne|work	then he has never used it
 n4nd0	she*
 blackburn	hmm how can it *not* overfit?
 n4nd0	mm I am not completely sure what was her claim
 n4nd0	let me check slides
 blackburn	n4nd0: I just can't see any 'rule' that makes it not overfitting algorithm
 blackburn	I mean how many weak classifiers do we need?
 blackburn	50, 100?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: gunnar back in the days wrote a paper about it improving the situation
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you want to use it for?
 sonne|work	back in 1999 or so
 blackburn	n4nd0: I was stupid enough last night to suggest to help with integrating some adaboost reg
 n4nd0	blackburn: multiboost code to shogun?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, adaboost reg by gunnar
 sonne|work	blackburn: I guess adaboost* is easy
 sonne|work	but you need the framework for baselearners
 sonne|work	so basically any shogun classifier could be baselearner
 blackburn	sonne|work: what kind of framework?
 sonne|work	blackburn: CBaseLearner ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: you mean some ensemble classifier
 n4nd0	sonne|work: if any shogun classifier could be a baselearner, why not CMachine?
 blackburn	that outputs this weighted sum?
 blackburn	that sounds easy - the only thing is how to learn these classifiers and their weights right?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yeah CMachine is what you will likely need to use though regression methods etc don't fit
 n4nd0	aham true
 sonne|work	blackburn: err no - you have a fixed parameter setting for base learners
 sonne|work	blackburn: so you just call train(data)
 sonne|work	and it is not so clear to me how to reweight data
 blackburn	sonne|work: ah so we need weighting support here
 n4nd0	found it in slides directly
 n4nd0	Beauty of AdaBoost
 n4nd0	among other things
 n4nd0	Test Errot: Asmptotes - no over-fitting observed. It continues to decrease after training error vanishes.
 blackburn	n4nd0: sounds like the best method
 blackburn	n4nd0: that's crazy
 n4nd0	Asymptotes*
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am sure it will increase as weighted sum of a lot of floats gets not really stable with time
 n4nd0	blackburn: IIRC the weights are normalized
 n4nd0	not sure if that helps in what you are referring to
 sonne|work	n4nd0: read the abstract of http://books.google.com/books?id=bMuzXPzlkG0C&pg=PA564&lpg=PA564&dq=gunnar+ratsch+adaboost*&source=bl&ots=MvrfwEEJIj&sig=G72a-SjKPxM6VIA0Xj_RdPtDYJc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2QplUbe3KMm7hAePioBI&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA
 sonne|work	n4nd0: no overfitting if no noise
 sonne|work	but w/ noise (which is always present)
 sonne|work	you have it
 sonne|work	that is gunnars '99 paper
 sonne|work	adaboost reg
 n4nd0	sonne|work: aham ok, I don't really know how to interpret the noise here
 sonne|work	n4nd0: well any measured data is noise
 n4nd0	the course I am talking about was really focused on using Adaboost for face detection
 n4nd0	with this Haar features
 sonne|work	yeah noisy
 sonne|work	as hell
 blackburn	modern method
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	svm is from 1997 :P
 n4nd0	mmm I don't really understand then why it is said like that in the slides
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah that's why svm is 'outdated' comparing to deep learning things
 sonne|work	and neural nets from decades ago :P
 blackburn	sonne|work: svm is from 1970 actually
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	even more outdated then
 sonne|work	deep learning is just hip again since people had SVMs (with guaranteed convergence) for long enough
 sonne|work	blackburn: theory of SVM maybe but not the applications
 blackburn	sonne|work: no it is pretty different
 blackburn	sonne|work: learning features is important
-!- gzhd79 [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	blackburn: so?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can't see SVM learning anything on features so it is quite different I'd say
 sonne|work	it is like what NN's have always done
 sonne|work	but since NN's have local minima
 sonne|work	they are extremely hard to control
 blackburn	sonne|work: when working on images it gets important
 sonne|work	the right features are important for any task
 shogun-buildbot	build #355 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/355
 n4nd0	blackburn: aren't there ways to use large margin SVM-like learning to choose features?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes but we should not engineer it
 blackburn	n4nd0: just *choose*
 n4nd0	on the meantime test break... :S
 blackburn	n4nd0: deep learning is about constructing a few levels from low-level (pixels)
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah sure that is the dream - but there still is a long way to go
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes but it is already making some steps to automagic features
 sonne|work	blackburn: with NNs you choose certain architectures, ways of training etc that have a massive impact on what features it learns
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's true
 sonne|work	blackburn: well then use MKL with all kinds of kernels
 sonne|work	it also learns some features
 blackburn	sonne|work: but SVM do not consider it at all
 sonne|work	but sucks badly
 sonne|work	I don't agree
 sonne|work	SVM learns important features in feature space
 sonne|work	but you limit the features by choosing a kernel
 n4nd0	sonne|work: why does the approach MKL with lot of kernels suck?
 sonne|work	and yes you have a hard time to express these features
 blackburn	sonne|work: feature selection is totally different from feature extraction
 sonne|work	n4nd0: it usually gives worse performance than just adding kernels
 blackburn	sonne|work: I tend to believe we should *extract* features not select
 sonne|work	I don't
 sonne|work	I think the more features - the better
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes, but again back to images
 blackburn	sonne|work: if we just select pixels
 blackburn	it always sucks
 blackburn	but if we have some high-level on it (like sift)
 sonne|work	blackburn: sure
 sonne|work	so they use convolutional NN's
 sonne|work	others suck too
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes convolution is a good base to transform pixels to something
 blackburn	sonne|work: it is engineered to do convolution - that's bad
 sonne|work	blackburn: believe - a ML method is as good as the person who trains it
 sonne|work	there are soo many tricks involved in everything
 sonne|work	there usually is no general rule
 sonne|work	saying that methodA is better than methodB
 sonne|work	some methods are a more natural choice for certain tasks of course but that's it
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am speaking not about methods but the approach
 shogun-buildbot	build #1009 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1009  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 blackburn	learning some method on engineered features is (in general) worse
 blackburn	than learning features and then method
 sonne|work	blackburn: to the contrary
 sonne|work	learning features & method together is usually worse
 sonne|work	humans are usually much better in engineering features
 blackburn	sonne|work: depends
 blackburn	sonne|work: with images (it is the only field I know) it is not - sparse features, dictionary learning, convolution stuff - these are better
 blackburn	sonne|work: e.g there is no heuristic in fitting HOG cell sizes
 blackburn	it is just stupid model selection
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes but if you then add prior knowledge and force the thing to focus on reasonable features
 sonne|work	you will get even better results
 blackburn	bah I am still at home should be at job
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 sonne|work	blackburn: and I am at work but hmm... ok working now
 sonne|work	cu!
 blackburn	sonne|work: you see
 blackburn	everything from the top is about extracting
 sonne|work	yes and lots of is about learning
 sonne|work	and lots of is about extracting & learning
 sonne|work	and limiting learning of features
 blackburn	sonne|work: ensembling + feature extraction + learning
 sonne|work	k-NN with 0.63!
 sonne|work	beats halv of the NN
 sonne|work	s
 blackburn	sonne|work: very well engineered distance I guess
 blackburn	shape context matching should be something that matches these curves in a smart way
 sonne|work	actually even 0.52
 sonne|work	better than any VM
 sonne|work	committee of 35 conv. net, 1-20-P-40-P-150-10 [elastic distortions] width normalization 0.23
 sonne|work	haha
 blackburn	sonne|work: it must be pretty slow
 sonne|work	and they do distortions etc
 sonne|work	the usual invariance tricks
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes most of top methods do it with distortions
 sonne|work	rotation/shifting lala

 sonne|work	we need HEROS
 blackburn	sonne|work: I don't mind a fluent machine code speaker in team
 sonne|work	true
 sonne|work	kind of a matrix operator
 sonne|work	we should equip ourselves with phone booths to exit the matrix
 sonne|work	and some reasonable mobiles
 blackburn	sonne|work: matrix operator is a must have
 sonne|work	but only one that can cope with a few liters of vodka per day
 blackburn	sonne|work: mind releasing 2.1.1 once I get finished with tapkee?
 sonne|work	you have to ask our release manager
 sonne|work	I think it has to be 2.2 btw

 sonne|work	we changed some api's

 Yanglittle	Hi, I have a question, how should I do when I want to combine the pre-computed kernel ? I didn't find the examples in the shogun.
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: just add the kernel like any other kernel
 sonne|work	you just don't need any features...
 Yanglittle	this is the usage of add_kernel: sg('add_kernel', weight, kernel-specific parameters)  the third parameter is replaced by pre-computed kernel matrix?
 blackburn	sonne|work: your biggest mistake was to formulate that demos idea :D
 sonne|work	ohh static interfaces
 sonne|work	Yanglittle: please use a modular interface
 blackburn	we have somewhat 5 6 7 may be 8?
-!- n4nd0 [~test@n133-p134.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun

 sonne|work	I still don't know how you get weights for examples to work w/ shogun
 sonne|work	but hey
 blackburn	sonne|work: I LOVE MAGIC CODE
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	blackburn: why should it push out an ML idea?
 blackburn	sonne|work: # slots?
 sonne|work	well last year we gave one back
 sonne|work	so...
 blackburn	sonne|work: true
 sonne|work	blackburn: look at http://codingplayground.blogspot.nl/2009/03/adaboost-improve-your-performance.html
 sonne|work	he also has the orginal adaboost algorithm in there
 blackburn	hahah funny code
 sonne|work	I didn't know that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel_prize
 sonne|work	the adaboost authors got that prize
 sonne|work	but for real boosting use http://www.multiboost.org/
 blackburn	sonne|work: in two words - what is the problem with integrating multiboost?
 sonne|work	blackburn: it is huuuge
 blackburn	sonne|work: and one more important Q - why multiboost doesn't have adaboost reg
 sonne|work	it has everytthing invented like we do but different ...
 sonne|work	it has adaboost MH
 blackburn	sonne|work: what is MH?
 sonne|work	www.lsi.upc.edu/~lluism/cursos/docSoria00/add2.ps.gz
 sonne|work	seems like for multilable
 sonne|work	label
 sonne|work	and w/ confidences
 sonne|work	but no regularization!?
 blackburn	I mean if adaboost reg is kind of cool - why didn't they implement it
 blackburn	that seems to be strange at least
 sonne|work	I guess early stopping is good enough

 gsomix	hi guys
 n4nd0	hey gsomix!
 medeeiip	hello everyone I's working to build the shogun on windows.... seems almost I've to  entirely rewrite math.h using _win32 preprocessor
 medeeiip	but currently i'm stuck with this error:
 medeeiip	use of undefined type 'shogun::shogun::CStringFeatures<ST>'
 medeeiip	1>          with
 medeeiip	1>          [
 medeeiip	1>              ST=uint16_t
 medeeiip	1>          ]
 n4nd0	ups rewriting code... that must be touch
 medeeiip	from src\shogun/distributions/HMM.h(582)
 n4nd0	medeeiip: how are you trying to build it? using cygwin?
 medeeiip	no native vs compiler......
 n4nd0	mmm I am not entirely sure what you mean
 blackburn	medeeiip: you probably didn't define a thing that enables that type
 n4nd0	in any case I think that the easiest way to get shogun working in windows is with cygwin, algthough I have no experience
 medeeiip	it's not about working.... I've enthu of porting shogun to windows...
 n4nd0	ah ok I see
 medeeiip	about that error:
 medeeiip	there is a def :
 medeeiip	CStringFeatures<uint16_t>* p_observations;
 medeeiip	one more thing i did....
 blackburn	medeeiip: -DUSE_UINT16 and so on
 medeeiip	implmented mmanwin32

 medeeiip	blackburn: I didn't understand
 medeeiip	what u just said
 medeeiip	 -DUSE_UINT16 where?
 blackburn	medeeiip: you should have USE_UINT16 define to have features for uint16_t enabled
 medeeiip	actually i used a #ifdef _WIN32 and included stdint.h
 medeeiip	where uint16_t is available
 medeeiip	I also implemented mman-win32 from https://code.google.com/p/mman-win32/
 medeeiip	so memory management shouldn't be a problem.....
 blackburn	medeeiip: hmm wait it is not necessary to have that define
 blackburn	it is relevant for interfaces but not for anything else it seems

 n4nd0	what problem do you have?

 arp	or some packages could not be downloaded
 n4nd0	Aham, I assumed you were installing from source, sorry.
 n4nd0	I didn't actually know you can install it via de software center :)

 Yanglittle	three steps I all executed.

 n4nd0	it could be that shogun was built against one of the versions and you are trying to run it using another

 Yanglittle	i installed two versions ago. now just version 2.7
 Yanglittle	i will rebuild it
 n4nd0	make sure the version of python detected by shogun is the same one you want to use
 n4nd0	detected by shogun = detected by the configure script
 Yanglittle	i will, thanks.
 ZeThomas	hey I get an error while compiling shogun2.1
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: and the error is?

 ZeThomas	lapack
 ZeThomas	i just installed openblas (and removed atlas)
 ZeThomas	and wanted to recompile
 ZeThomas	numpy 1.7 has been recompiled successfully just now
 n4nd0	mm then maybe it is imcopatible with openblas?

 ZeThomas	blackburn: do you know if shogun supports openblas?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: should be possible I think
 ZeThomas	i compiled it, and successfully numpy with it
 ZeThomas	but shogun gives me errors
 ZeThomas	http://pastebin.com/GYeSxjGR
 blackburn	ZeThomas: ehmmm 311 looks strange to me :)
 blackburn	why 'I' is treated as complex
 blackburn	ZeThomas: what is the compiler?
 ZeThomas	gcc
 ZeThomas	4.7
 blackburn	ZeThomas: could you please try to put some char('I') or so?
 blackburn	311 and 347 of src/shogun/mathematics/lapack.cpp
 ZeThomas	so line 311 becomes: char I = char('I') ?
 blackburn	yes
 ZeThomas	ok
 ZeThomas	done, I'm trying to recompile now
* ZeThomas goes for coffee while shogun compiles
 blackburn	ZeThomas: you may use make -j4 to use 4 cores
 ZeThomas	oh, that's handy :)
 sonne|work	and ccache!
 blackburn	yes and ccache

 ZeThomas	thanks n4nd0
 blackburn	n4nd0: ?? would that work?
 sonne|work	IIRC you need to install ccache and put a certain dir in $PATH
 sonne|work	such that it calls ccache when gcc is called
 blackburn	and replace CXX and CC with ccache g++
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you normally use it as make --ccache?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I always do ccache make blah blah
 blackburn	n4nd0: so does that work with ccache make?
 blackburn	bah..
 n4nd0	hehe I hope so
 blackburn	sonne|work: any idea why 'I' is treated as complex?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: okay other guess
 blackburn	'\I' maybe?
 sonne|work	what is going on?
 sonne|work	blackburn: my suggestion is to use char range = 'I';
 sonne|work	then it should work
 sonne|work	blackburn: I think it treats I as a complex nr

 ZeThomas	blackburn, sonne|work, this seems to have done the trick: I refactored every occurence of [varname] I to range
 ZeThomas	however it gives errors for SGMatrix.cpp (http://pastebin.com/KV8Yzi9Y), I suspect of the same kind
 sonne|work	    SGMatrix<int8_t> I(size, size);
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	could you please call this identity there?
 sonne|work	ZeThomas: and please send us a git pull request against the develop branch
 ZeThomas	sonne|work: I'd be delighted, but you might want to talk me through it, I'm a git noob...
 sonne|work	n4nd0: could you     please help ZeThomas?
 n4nd0	back again
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ^ please help him to set up git if you have time  - thanks!
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: so how is it going
 n4nd0	although I have not tried yet myself git-flow, blackburn or someone else can tell us if we need some help about it though
 ZeThomas	ok n4nd0, I git cloned git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 blackburn	yeah sure
 ZeThomas	and made the changes
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: ok then let's start again
 blackburn	ZeThomas: I am afraid you would need to transfer your changs to your fork
 blackburn	ZeThomas: is it ubuntu/debian you are running?
 ZeThomas	blackburn: yes
 n4nd0	because you fork the main repository and clone that one
 blackburn	ZeThomas: please install git flow (sudo apt-get install git-flow)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I guess however it can enough enough changing the remotes?
 blackburn	n4nd0: ha good point
 ZeThomas	blackburn: done
 blackburn	alright
 blackburn	now you have to 'git flow init'
 ZeThomas	ok: Branch name for production releases: [master]
 ZeThomas	?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: give me a second
 n4nd0	this was already explained in the mailing list
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes that's default
 n4nd0	I can send you a link
 blackburn	ZeThomas: next release is develop

 ZeThomas	n4nd0: oh, and in c++, global names take precedence over local ones? or in no case can you have doubles?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: with doubles you mean two variables with the same name?
 ZeThomas	n4nd0: yes
 ZeThomas	as you can do in python e.g.
 n4nd0	I am not sure
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: what could it be otherwise?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: oops sorry
 blackburn	ZeThomas: git flow support start complex_literals
 ZeThomas	blackburn: Missing argument <base>

 blackburn	ZeThomas: you may get that link on the page of your fork
 ZeThomas	blackburn: fatal: No such remote 'origin'
 ZeThomas	git remote add origin https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git ?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: origin should point to your fork, not to the main one
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: it should be something like ...ZeThomas/shogun.git
 n4nd0	where ZeThomas is your username in github
 ZeThomas	oh, I'm so bad at git...
 ZeThomas	so git remote add origin https://github.com/tp199911/shogun.git ?
 n4nd0	it is hard at the beginning, I suggest you to check gitbook and some videocasts
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: did you already fork in github?
 ZeThomas	yes, that link is my fork
 blackburn	ZeThomas: better use ssh url
 blackburn	however https would work too
 n4nd0	blackburn: faster with ssh?
 blackburn	n4nd0: requires no authorization
 ZeThomas	ok, so I do: git remote add origin git@github.com:tp199911/shogun.git ?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh yeah, sure
 ZeThomas	blackburn: ok, that's done
 blackburn	ZeThomas: ok near to ready!
 blackburn	ZeThomas: try to do git push origin

 n4nd0	blackburn: but not idea about git flow yet :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is just about branches I think
 yefuneh	n4nd0 - thanks. What is load_labels for? My test and training data are in a format like: -1 1:5 2:7 ... where -1 is the label
 n4nd0	yefuneh: wild guess - load labels is to take the labels from a file and put them in a variable
 yefuneh	n4nd0 thanks
 n4nd0	yefuneh: if you labels are in that format you can either code your own functions to parse the data in a similar way to how it is done in the load.lua script
 n4nd0	yefuneh: or you can create new data files following the convention of the files used in the example and re-use the load functions
 ZeThomas	n4nd0, me to I have to get to work... can we do this some other time?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: sure
 n4nd0	just come around some time
 ZeThomas	ok, cheers
 ZeThomas	cu, thanks for the help
 yefuneh	n4nd0 - I'll have to look at the example files. Based on the examples it seems much more complicated then running svmlight/libsvm directly on the data

 kipp	blackburn: kernel matrix should be postive definate
 blackburn	kipp: yeah but it would be a test for kernel not pca, right? ;)
 kipp	yes ,yes.sorry typed pca by mistake
 blackburn	kipp: integration tests are usually checking if results are staying the same
 blackburn	so it would be just project something and check if it is the same as it was before
 kipp	so its like a accuracy checker
 blackburn	kipp: some sort of
 kipp	k,so its like checking ,if the data has become linearly separable or not
 blackburn	kipp: no the data stays so the output should stay too
 kipp	as in the output data  is same as the input data after kernel pca
 blackburn	kipp: no as output data is the same after some code is changed

 blackburn	heiko1:
 blackburn	one thing on kpca
 heiko1	blackburn:
 blackburn	heiko1: tapkee supports kpca, may be it makes sense to change the code to use it
 heiko1	blackburn: yes that might be good
 heiko1	could you update the task?
 blackburn	heiko1: yeah will do
 heiko1	or maybe add another one for that
 heiko1	since the example doesnt depend on the backend
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	that's better
 heiko1	cool
 blackburn	naywhayare: I see
 heiko1	blackburn: could we go into the git issue again? :)
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	heiko1: what is the issue?
 heiko1	still no idea how to commit ;)
 heiko1	git flow
 heiko1	remember?
 blackburn	oh shh
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	heiko1: could you please remind me the status we got into?
 heiko1	git flow init
 heiko1	Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
 heiko1	   - master
 heiko1	Branch name for production releases: [master]
 heiko1	I cannot select development
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko1: yes because it is not here
 heiko1	exactly
 blackburn	probably
 blackburn	heiko1: is it your fork?
 heiko1	yes
 blackburn	heiko1: lets try
 blackburn	git checkout -b develop upstream/develop
 heiko1	fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.
 heiko1	Did you intend to checkout 'upstream/develop' which can not be resolved as commit?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	git branch develop upstream/develop?
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	heiko1: wait
 blackburn	heiko1: lets do that
 blackburn	git fetch upstream
 blackburn	it should load all branches
 heiko1	argh
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	of course
 blackburn	heiko1: but you'd still need to create your branch too
 heiko1	remember  when you said git pull --rebase includes git fetch upstream?
 blackburn	heiko1: yes
 blackburn	pull is fetch + merge
 blackburn	or fetch + rebase
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 heiko1	okay hzow to fetch the branch now?
 blackburn	heiko1: does git branch -va
 blackburn	show you remote branch
 blackburn	of develop?
 heiko1	yes
 blackburn	heiko1: alright
 blackburn	heiko1: just create develop
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	heiko1: I think you need to create a branch based on upstream/develop
 heiko1	is there a difference between dev and develop?
-!- kakashi_ [~kakashi_@nltk/kakashi] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 blackburn	heiko1: dev should be deleted
 heiko1	ok
 blackburn	heiko1: it is deleted but git is distributed so it stayed in your copy
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 heiko1	blackburn: ok so now I created develop
 blackburn	alright
 blackburn	heiko1: git push origin develop
 heiko1	how to update it?
 blackburn	git rebase upstream/develop
 heiko1	ok pushed
-!- kakashi_ [~kakashi_@nltk/kakashi] has joined #shogun
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 heiko1	and now?
 blackburn	heiko1: git flow init
 heiko1	blackburn:  how to update the develop branch?
 blackburn	heiko1: git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds..
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	heiko1: what do you mean by update?
 heiko1	haha :)
 heiko1	nevermind
 heiko1	Which branch should be used for integration of the "next release"?
 blackburn	next release is develop
 heiko1	and production release?
 heiko1	Ill check your mail
 blackburn	heiko1: master
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 blackburn	heiko1: everything is default
 heiko1	ok worked
 blackburn	except versiontag
 heiko1	so now I modify develop right?
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	nope
 blackburn	now you
 blackburn	git flow feature start my_awesome_feature
 blackburn	git commit ...
 heiko1	ok
 blackburn	git flow feature finish my_awesome_feature
 heiko1	what does this? merge it into develop
 heiko1	?
 blackburn	heiko1: finish merges and deletes the branch
 heiko1	I see
 heiko1	and then I push develop?
 blackburn	yes
 heiko1	whats the command for that?
 heiko1	just push?
 blackburn	heiko1: but actually I have absolutely no idea how to handle that better
 blackburn	heiko1: yes
 blackburn	heiko1: I'd suggest you to finally commit in the main repository
 heiko1	at which point?
 blackburn	PRs are additional headache here
 heiko1	what do you  mean by that?
 heiko1	a I see
 heiko1	no Ill do PR
 heiko1	better for me
 blackburn	heiko1: just merge it directly
 heiko1	I tend to mess up repos
 blackburn	why?
 heiko1	fucked up mine about 100 times
 blackburn	hmm
 heiko1	so safer for me to work on the fork
 heiko1	also we have a history
 heiko1	think thats better
 heiko1	and travis
 heiko1	and I can see the diff in the PR view
 blackburn	heiko1: yeah that has pros and conses
 heiko1	I know, but Id rather stay on the safe side here
 heiko1	thanks for the help!
 blackburn	heiko1: but actually it would be better so consider moving some day ;)
 blackburn	heiko1: the thing is that we do group commits this way
 blackburn	so develop could look like a bunch of merges
 heiko1	thats not bad right?
 blackburn	ideally it looks like
 blackburn	merge feature a
 blackburn	merge feature b
 blackburn	master is even more compressive
 blackburn	it contains only tags

@sonney2k	gsomix, IDK if you recall
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	but whenever some object is transferred from C++ -> python
@sonney2k	python needs to keep somehow track of the object and potentially destroy / deallocate it
@sonney2k	this is done via reference counts
@sonney2k	so we register 2 functions
@sonney2k	called ref()
@sonney2k	and unref()
@sonney2k	that take care of this from python
@sonney2k	for R modular these functions seem not to work
@sonney2k	at least we just get crashes when these are enabled

@sonney2k	gsomix, and much less memory requirements

 n4nd0	isn't already something similar on the page? about > related projects
 n4nd0	what about there?
 n4nd0	maybe a subpage
 n4nd0	sub-subpage
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am surprised with that guy - he opens issues in various repos on that
 blackburn	I just do not really get the motivation beneath
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but it is cool
@sonney2k	staying within standard (to the extent possible) will keep us out of trouble
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah and out of native compiling on window$
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is not just related projects though but also feature comparison
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: VS heavily violates everything I know
@sonney2k	ahh that
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw why does it appear shogun last updates 2010??
@sonney2k	n4nd0, because that is when we updated the .csv
@sonney2k	err google doc
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't like having a UUID in there though
 blackburn	sonney2k: UUID is ok but ugly
@sonney2k	then everything should be autogenerated
@sonney2k	yeah because of ugliness
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see no actual reason to do that
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I would go for either about > information > feature comparison or about > related projects > feature comparison
 blackburn	chances STL get a header named SG_CUSTOM_KERNEL_H_ are ehmm low
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it would be nice though to have a link to it or sth where one can see part of the matrix png from the homepage
@sonney2k	n4nd0, agreed
@sonney2k	but it needs updating too
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what needs updating?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that was pre shogun 1.0 IIRC
@sonney2k	we have like 100'd more kernels
@sonney2k	and so might have other projects
@sonney2k	and other features of course
 n4nd0	aaah ok I thought the google docs you have sent around today was up-to-date
