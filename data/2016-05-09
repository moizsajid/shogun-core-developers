 CaBa	hi
 CaBa	how can I iterate throuh ModelSelectionParameters in python?
@wiking	ehhe hwe should create a FAQ from your questions :)

 CaBa	wiking: hm, is that a good or a bad thing? ;)
 CaBa	wiking: theoretically this is even covered in the python examples, there a snippet of code that is commented out. and it doesn't work. which is probably the reason ;)
@wiking	good
@wiking	i mean it's a good thing

 travis-ci	it's Heiko Strathmann's turn to pay the next round of drinks for the massacre he caused in shogun-toolbox/shogun: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/128822804
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-226-161-6.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has left #shogun []
 CaBa	wiking: but you don't happen to know how to do this? ;)
 CaBa	https://bpaste.net/show/0d23ef9e38bd <- this kind of code doesn't work unfortunately

 Saurabh7	CaBa, this should work http://pastebin.com/3sEfzpu6
 CaBa	Saurabh7: uh, how does that work? does it remember how many times it was called?
 CaBa	Saurabh7: and why doesn't the other approach work?
 CaBa	Can one disable the whole googlemock thing during build?
 Saurabh7	CaBa, first one works in c++ just checked
 Saurabh7	so its a return type issue in python
 Saurabh7	CaBa, disable tests with DENABLE_TESTING=OFF
 CaBa	Saurabh7: i saw the pointer type casting happening in C++, i don't know how SWIG handles this
 CaBa	Saurabh7: the class name looks fine in python, i.e. what i get in return. it just doesn't seem to have any members...
 Saurabh7	yes for python it looks like that it has no members because its SGObject type , weird but needs to be fixed i think
 Saurabh7	CaBa, name might look fine beacuse SGObject->get_name() still returns the correct name
 CaBa	Saurabh7: i see
 CaBa	Saurabh7: get_single_combination() just iterates through all combinations infinitely?
