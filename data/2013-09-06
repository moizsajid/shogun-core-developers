@iglesiasg	hey hushell
 hushell	iglesiasg: hey
 hushell	iglesiasg: how is going?
@iglesiasg	hushell, I am good, what about you?
@iglesiasg	we should separate that pull request I think
 hushell	iglesiasg: good, let's talk here :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: I close this PR or just remove cmake files and make them a new PR?
@iglesiasg	hushell, I will answer there your last question hehe
@iglesiasg	hushell, the second option sounds cool
@iglesiasg	remove the CMake part from this pull request
@iglesiasg	and do another one from another branch with just the find cmake
@iglesiasg	the find mosek, sorry
 hushell	iglesiasg: I see how useful the branches :)
 hushell	iglesiasg: okay, I do it right away
@iglesiasg	nice
@iglesiasg	thank you
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: this morning it was around 200MB and sometimes 150MB
 sonne|work	switching between releases(!)
 sonne|work	lets see what we get in the evening
@iglesiasg	mmm
@iglesiasg	sonne|work,  but is there such a big change between one commit and the next one?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I will have to plot this
@iglesiasg	good idea
 sonne|work	and I will add this to the buildbot
@iglesiasg	awesome
 sonne|work	so that we always have some figure to look at
 sonne|work	we could include compile time too btw

 besser82	Hello to all! Is it known that currently ~ 300 tests are failing? See: http://ur1.ca/fecpl
@wiking	sonne|work: hey
@wiking	and morning all
@wiking	sonne|work: about the new osx buildbot, should it be called osx2?
@iglesiasg	wiking, yoyo! Hope you had a great time in the wedding!
@iglesiasg	besser82, omg 300 is a lot :O
@iglesiasg	besser82, is there an error trace?
 besser82	unit-tests are segfaulting, btw...
@wiking	iglesiasg: hehehe yeah i had :)
 besser82	iglesiasg: how to produce such trace?
 shogun-buildbot	build #1620 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1620  blamelist: van51 <vangelis_51@hotmail.com>
@iglesiasg	besser82, so you used ctest to run those tests, right?
 besser82	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	besser82, there is an option, let me check it
@iglesiasg	besser82, ctest --output-on-failure I think
@wiking	iglesiasg: yes it's that one
 besser82	iglesiasg, will re-run this on current commit && pastebin :)
@iglesiasg	 wiking, I checked it in the mail you sent ^^
@iglesiasg	besser82, cool, thanks
 besser82	iglesiasg: may take up ~15 mins
 besser82	iglesiasg: need some details about the lib-version i'm using?
@iglesiasg	besser82, yes, those could be useful once we get to see the trace probably
@iglesiasg	besser82, anyway, the Shogun version is?
@iglesiasg	current develop?
 besser82	iglesiasg: yes, current develop / libs are mostly take from F19 system
 sonne|work	besser82: errm doesn't look like anything fails https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/11050261
 sonne|work	wiking: sec meeting
@iglesiasg	besser82, F19?
 besser82	iglesiasg: Fedora 19 ;)
@iglesiasg	got it, thanks!
@wiking	sonne|work: ok
@wiking	iglesiasg: heheh we need to install fedora on the new machine as i suspected ;P
 besser82	sonne|work: those are only ~108, when I run testsuite there are ~570...
@iglesiasg	hushell, I will have a look to the non-cmake PR ASAP, it is still sort of big so I will need to put apart fome minutes for it, probably this evening!
 sonne|work	wiking: besser82 is packaging shogun for fedora
 sonne|work	just FYI
@wiking	besser82: oh great, how do you want to do the packaging for fedora?
 besser82	wiking: for the official fedora repo ;)
 hushell	iglesiasg: no worries, I am going to sleep now, see you tomorrow
@wiking	besser82: yes but what do you want to use?
@iglesiasg	hushell, bye bye, good night
 hushell	bye guys :)
 besser82	wiking: kk, got it :)   Mostly the libs provided by system.  Already finished some pkgs for ColPack and nlopt.
@wiking	besser82: no you don't get me
@wiking	besser82: how do you want to create the packages of shogun for fedora?
@wiking	besser82: some scripts or how?
 besser82	wiking: rpm-spec

-!- iglesiasg_ [~iglesias@n139-p12.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
@wiking	besser82: ok.... do you know cpack?
 besser82	wiking: sure, but won't fit fedora's packaging guidelines ;)
@wiking	besser82: why not?
 sonne|work	wiking: rules
@wiking	i mean it just uses rpm-spec afaik
@wiking	sonne|work: yes i know
 sonne|work	wiking: same with .deb's created by this
@wiking	but you can do all the things afaik according to the riules
@wiking	rules
@wiking	i mean it's just a script language
 besser82	wiking: yes, but it's not integrated in the build-system used by most distros ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so what should be with the osx bot? as i'll setup there the static analyzer as it's far more updated than the one coming with ubuntu
 sonne|work	wiking: what osx bot?
 sonne|work	you have one now?
 sonne|work	from gunnar or VM or ...?
@wiking	besser82: ok so basically you are saying that we'll need to have some extra files in our repo for supporting fedora packaging?
@wiking	sonne|work: VM... i'm just about to set it up
 besser82	wiking: not really
 sonne|work	wiking: nice
@wiking	sonne|work: i don't know anything about gunnar's

@wiking	sonne|work: so should it be osx2?
 sonne|work	wiking: yea gunnar == /dev/null
@wiking	sonne|work: lol ok
 sonne|work	wiking: yes osx2
@wiking	sonne|work: do u control now shogun-toolbox.org?
 besser82	wiking: but if you want I can create some rpm-template for use with cpack ;)
@wiking	besser82: no i mean how one will be able to build the packages after?
 sonne|work	wiking: not really but I can create a few subdomains
 sonne|work	wiking: if we still want one ...
-!- iglesiasg_ [~iglesias@n139-p12.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
@wiking	sonne|work: ok i'll think about it...
@wiking	besser82: so basically what i'm saying is that we ourselves would like to build fedora packages nightly
@wiking	besser82: how can we do that...?
 besser82	wiking: You'll need some spec-template and src-tarball
 besser82	wiking: build a srpm from that and pass it to some build-worker ;)

@wiking	mmm good back in shogun business :P aiming for 3.0
@wiking	yeah it was really cool
@HeikoS	yeah :)
@wiking	spent the whole week in cote d'azur
 besser82	wiking: there's a way to archive this by using cpack and some extra make-target ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: ah sweet!
@wiking	besser82: that's alright
 besser82	wiking: so people can build everything needed from sources
@wiking	besser82: yes i got ya
 besser82	wiking: like generating spec from template and such ;)
@wiking	besser82: afaik we'll not add this directly into shogun's repo but rather a submodule...
@wiking	but still i'd like to provide this
@wiking	for everybody
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	besser82: i'll create now a fedora stable buildbot
 besser82	wiking: would be just one more ascii-file in repo ;)
 besser82	wiking: sounds good ;)
@wiking	besser82: and we'll see what's happening when u try to build
@wiking	besser82: what do you reccommend for a buildbot
@wiking	besser82: i mean which fedora... ? is there like fedora-server?
 besser82	wiking: Fedoa 19 would be good ;)
 besser82	wiking: not really
 besser82	wiking: you will just need minimal

@wiking	:(
 sonne|work	I mean you do currently so no need to redo this
 sonne|work	wiking: PATH needs to be set
@wiking	ok other things work
@wiking	P
 sonne|work	bashrc
 besser82	wiking: it's a very basic chroot ;) just the ABSOLUTELY minimum ;)
 sonne|work	/etc/bash.bashrc
 sonne|work	heh
@wiking	ok
 besser82	wiking: yum groups install 'C Development Tools and Libraries'
@wiking	yum makecache is working now
@wiking	after this  yum groups install 'C Development Tools and Libraries' ?
 sonne|work	wiking: I hope you did the template before that...
@wiking	sonne|work: what template? :)
@wiking	no i did nothing
 sonne|work	excellent :(
@wiking	i just untar-ed the tar.xz i've got from besser82
@HeikoS	guys I do not get it, CMakeList.txt want g++ >= 4.3 and I have 4.4 but it still says too old :(
@wiking	i mean what else would i need to template?
 sonne|work	wiking: well we need to redo these steps (before the untar) for other chroots
@wiking	sonne|work: before?
 besser82	wiking: depends on what you want to do?
@wiking	i didn't do anything before
@wiking	sonne|work: i'll just add 3 lines into fstab and that's all
@HeikoS	ah it was cached
@HeikoS	thats not good, should be updated automatically
@wiking	other than that it's untar and then just runc chroot <path> <shell>
 besser82	wiking: why don't you use schroot?
@wiking	besser82: do i care? :)
@wiking	besser82: i know i should
 besser82	wiking: :D
@wiking	sonne|work: so there's really not much to template apart from the fstab lines
@wiking	this image i've got besser82 is already done smoothly
@wiking	besser82: ok i'm yum-ing the stuff
 besser82	wiking: so after the yum parts there should be everything up for basic builds
@wiking	besser82: afaik i should still install buildslave, cmake and ....?
@wiking	git i guess
 besser82	wiking: you might need to install some more stuff like cmake and additionally needed -devel pks ;)
 besser82	wiking: I'll make a list just a moment...
@wiking	besser82: well i just want to fire up a buildslave
@wiking	besser82: and see all the errors :)
@wiking	ok i guess i shouldnt run a buildslave with root :P
@wiking	i'll just run as nobody:nogroup

 thoralf	sonne|work: Just re-initializing an object with different values?
@wiking	besser82: almost there... need to setup the buildmaster
 thoralf	sonne|work: I'm using new[] to allocate a bunch of BinaryLabels, but they're all zero-length.  So I tried to reallocate like described and got 700 errors in valgrind.
 sonne|work	thoralf: since these sgobjects use refcounting you shouldn't do stuff like this
 thoralf	sonne|work: Okay, shouldn't do.  Thanks, then I'll use sth ilke SG_MALLOC.
 sonne|work	thoralf: why not keep SGVectors?
 sonne|work	and then set the labels?

@wiking	besser82: ok just a sec
 besser82	iglesiasg: here's oupt with data-files avail: http://ur1.ca/fedve
@iglesiasg	besser82, import modshogun ImportError: No module named modshogun
@iglesiasg	besser82, it seems to be a problem with python installation
@wiking	besser82: i'll just cronio with -d 9
@wiking	that should trigger the problem
 besser82	wiking: kk
@wiking	i mean cronie.x86_64
 besser82	iglesiasg: testsuite is run without having (python-)modshogun installed on system...
@wiking	yum install -d 9 cronie.x86_64 ?
@wiking	or yum -d 9 install ?
 besser82	wiking: does the same ;)
 besser82	iglesiasg: so I need to set PYTHONPATH i guess?
@wiking	besser82: http://pastebin.com/8SfKYuLb
@iglesiasg	besser82, well then it is normal that Python examples break :)
@iglesiasg	besser82, But that sounds weird, since the tests are not run for the interfaces that are not selected at install
@wiking	besser82: owah man this i never seen before
@iglesiasg	besser82, aaah ok. So you mean that Python modular is selected at installation but the installation is not visible to Python

@wiking	bash-4.2# ls -la /usr/bin/crontab
@wiking	-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 53472 Sep  6 10:37 /usr/bin/crontab
@wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	besser82, then yes, you need to set PYTHONPATH to look at the dist-packages directory and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to libshogun.so
@iglesiasg	besser82, well or equivalent env for LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Fedora, no idea hehe
@wiking	besser82: but i ran chmod 755 /usr/bin/crontab
@wiking	and it was all fine

 thoralf	sonne|work: "thoralf: why not keep SGVectors?" <-- because my process returns BinaryLabels
 besser82	wiking: are you running selinux on host?
 thoralf	sonne|work: Anyway, it does not change my problem: Allocating memory for storing X objects and the setting each.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Just didn't know that new[] is problematic.
 besser82	wiking: or is chroot dir on nfs?
 thoralf	sonne|work: And, btw., BinaryLabels::set_labels() copies the sgvector.
 besser82	wiking: if chroot-dir in on NFS then you must mount it with "no_root_squash"
@HeikoS	sonne|work, travis is red, I know its since my merge, but its some ruby matrix problems, I have no idea how to fix this
@wiking	besser82: i guess.. sonne|work would know it better
 besser82	wiking: exec `echo "%_netsharedpath /" >> /etc/rpm/macros` inside the chroot and try yum again please
@wiking	besser82: it's not nfs for sure
@wiking	besser82: but i dont know what is the security shit
 besser82	wiking: which security shit?
@wiking	besser82: the stuff that makes /proc/modules disappear
@wiking	:)
 besser82	which option you use to mount /proc
 besser82	mount -o rbind ?
 besser82	or mount -o bind ?
 sonne|work	thoralf: well you can get the label vector from your binary labels (SGVector) and drop the label object
 sonne|work	thoralf: hmmhh it should no longer be necessary to copy
 thoralf	sonne|work: Thats right.  But won't I get the same problem with SGVector?  Allocating an array for storing it, and finally reassign the entries?
 sonne|work	thoralf: well you could of course keep using binarylabels but then just store ptr's of the objects (CDynamicObjectArray ...)
@HeikoS	sonne|work, wiking do we want compile errors if lapacl is not present? currently this happens, or rather tell cmake to block if this is not there?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: therre?
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, tell me
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: your stuff is using PCA
@HeikoS	which is not defined if LAPACK is not present
@HeikoS	so compile error
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, aaah I am missing the HAVE
@iglesiasg	sorry :(
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: no worries
@HeikoS	could you fix that now?
@HeikoS	otherwise I will do it
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sure
@iglesiasg	HAVE_LAPACK I gues it is

@HeikoS	ok cool, sonne|work do we have a buildbot without lapack to check this?
@iglesiasg	so why should it work without LAPACK as well?
@iglesiasg	I don't really get it
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: there should be at least no compile error
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, mmmm ok. I ignore how that is handled though :)
@HeikoS	rather a runtime error that your class is not available if LAPACK isnt
@HeikoS	or just jide it
@HeikoS	but then you also have to do this in the examples/tests
@iglesiasg	aham
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: or
@HeikoS	replace the lapack calls in PCA by eigen3
@HeikoS	should be less work actually
 sonne|work	HeikoS: sure
@HeikoS	 :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: and since you are using pca in your class which is tested, PCA is also implicitly tested so you got a guard whether these replacements change results
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: let me check CPCA and how much work that would be
@iglesiasg	ok
@HeikoS	3 calls
@HeikoS	should I change?
@HeikoS	no comments what the calls do, very nice
@HeikoS	backward engineering :D
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ah I dont know
@wiking	besser82: -o bind
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: how much work is it to LAPACK guard your stuff?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: could you do that asap? I currently cannot compile and am a bit in a hurry
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, I could do it if you tell me what is to be guarded
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, so sonne|work said the class is not necessary
@HeikoS	CPCA is not available if LAPACK is not
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, then, just the tests, or?
@HeikoS	so your class, which uses CPCA, also has to be unavailable if LAPACK isnt
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: same holds for all the examples/tests that include your CLMNNImpl class
@HeikoS	tests not maybe
@HeikoS	but its easy to add in unit tests
@HeikoS	python is not that important I guess, just good practice
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: but if you could guard the CLMNNImpl and classes that include it, that would already allow me to compile libshogun
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, ok. Give me a couple of minutes then
@iglesiasg	I am on it
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thanks a lot!

@wiking	iglesiasg: no lapack on this machine yet
@wiking	;)
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	but this is rather the problem of the unit tests
@iglesiasg	no LMNN error there though
@iglesiasg	so I guess those are other classes not guarded with HAVE_LAPACK
@wiking	uyeah it was my bad sorry
@iglesiasg	ah all right, no problem
@wiking	i just grepped for lapack:P
 thoralf	sonne|work: I'm confused.  This "SGVector v=SGVector(10); v=SGVector(20);" works, although the same pattern does not work for CBinaryLabels.
 thoralf	sonne|work: I know, it has a different base class.  But the issue was about reference counting, which applies to both.
 sonne|work	thoralf: well there is some magic to support this o_O
 sonne|work	for SGVector, sparsevector
 sonne|work	and matrix
 thoralf	sonne|work: And may I rely on this magic?
 sonne|work	currently yes

 besser82	wiking: nice to hear.  have been afk for lunch ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: ok just a question: if i would add the shogun-fedora1 bot under rpm1 - libshogun, would it always build, or it's like a round-robin then?
 thoralf	sonne|work: But actually it's the only we to get certain things done.
@wiking	besser82: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/rpm2%20-%20libshogun/builds/4

 sonne|work	wiking: we have that for deb modular
 sonne|work	and static etc
 sonne|work	wiking: I no longer think it is a good idea. setups deviate slightly
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so if i add the sid version of fedora then it should be rpm3 - libshogun or something
 sonne|work	so we have weird behaviour
 sonne|work	wiking: I would rather use one rpm for RHEL6.3
 sonne|work	and one for FC19 etc
@wiking	sonne|work: i'll add rpmX - modular
@wiking	ok so what should be the name
@wiking	as i'm about to create the other buildbot targets
@wiking	like modular f19
@wiking	and modular fedora 'sid'
@wiking	btw i've just add 2 threads for the buildslave as we'll have some amount of buildslaves running now on that machine ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: or even distribution names lice RH63 / FC19
@wiking	sonne|work: ok
@wiking	so i'll start renaming it to FC19

 blaubaer_	Hello
@wiking	hey
 blaubaer_	I have a question regarding the model selection feature of shogun
 besser82	wiking: thanks to you for setting this up ;)
 besser82	wiking: the FC19 builder, I mean ;)
@wiking	besser82: well we still need some time
 blaubaer_	I have my line: best_parameters=model_selection.select_model()
@wiking	besser82: go ahead
 blaubaer_	which works fine
 blaubaer_	now i would like to access the found parameters as strings or whatever to use them elsewhere in my program
 blaubaer_	so something like: best_parameters.get_parameter("name")
 blaubaer_	as it seems my machine parameter configuration contains children
 blaubaer_	root with C with values: vector=[1] kernel:"GaussianKernel" normalizer:"IdentityKernelNormalizer" width with values: vector=[1]
 blaubaer_	best_parameters.print_tree()
 blaubaer_	root with
 blaubaer_	C with values: vector=[1]
 blaubaer_	kernel:"GaussianKernel"
 blaubaer_	normalizer:"IdentityKernelNormalizer"
 blaubaer_	width with values: vector=[1]
 blaubaer_	how can i access C, kernel name and normalizer?
 blaubaer_	i am using the python bindings
 blaubaer_	best_parameters.apply_to_machine(machine)
 blaubaer_	print best_parameters.get_parameter('C',machine)
 blaubaer_	None
@wiking	besser82: should i have yum makecache && yum -y distro-sync for fedora 19 weekly?
@wiking	or just for the 'sid'?
@wiking	blaubaer_: mmm HeikoS would know the answer for this
 blaubaer_	ok
@wiking	HeikoS: ping
 blaubaer_	thanks for the reply. how or when could i ask him
@wiking	blaubaer_: he should be around
@wiking	now :)
 blaubaer_	:)

 besser82	wiking: daily ;)
@wiking	besser82: both?
 besser82	wiking: both ;)
@wiking	besser82: crond is not running, and i cannot find /etc/init.d/crond or something to start it
 besser82	wiking: just a minute ;)
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, I also think that get_parameter as you were doing is the way to obtain the value of the parameter
 blaubaer_	the line print best_parameters.get_parameter('C',machine)
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, do you have a minimal code sample where this is not working fine?
 blaubaer_	i tried to show you above
 blaubaer_	print_tree() shows the correct values
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, something I could download and execute in my machine so I can try around
 besser82	wiking: yum install cronie && systemctl enable chrond && service chrond start
 blaubaer_	however get_parameter() does not let me access it
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, pastebin, gist, or something similar could help
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, I see
@wiking	besser82: root@ks312251 /]# systemctl enable chrond && service chrond start
@wiking	Operation failed: Invalid argument
@wiking	isn't it crond
@wiking	?:)
@wiking	noup
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_,  I have not really used a lot the model selection framework, but if you have some minimal code I can try to see what's going on
@wiking	that did not help
 blaubaer_	it's now part of a larger codebase. i would take a while
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, ok, then maybe wait until Heiko can answer you
 besser82	wiking: sure, sry for the typo it's crond ;)
@wiking	besser82: same error
 blaubaer_	@iglesiasg: thanks for the try
@wiking	besser82: systemctl gives this

-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, I am not sure, but I think that the print you are trying to do in the example doesn't work because the parameters do not belong to the classifier, but to the kernel
 blaubaer_	i am not sure if i made my point correctly. the print works. i want to access the VALUES of the parameter object to save them outside of shogun. i want to remember the result of the model selection.
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, well the print was showing None, right?
 blaubaer_	print_tree() correctly shows the whole tree
 blaubaer_	i just do not know how to access the value of one parameter
 blaubaer_	as a string or something
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, print best_combination.get_parameter() I meant, sorry

 blaubaer_	print is just an example
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, I understand that you don't want to print them but get the value
 blaubaer_	:) good
 blaubaer_	i totally do not get, why i cannot access the values of C1 and C2. besides that the kernel values degree distance name_of_kernel are another problem. as i understand they are children of the class ParameterCombination and there seems to be no python wrapper function for get_child() or something similar

@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, It seems that the parameters that you can get have to be associated with an object
 blaubaer_	ok. can you tell me with what kind of an object?
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, so check for instance param_gaussian_kernel inside the create_param_tree function
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, the kernel parameter in there is associated with the Gaussian kernel
@iglesiasg	then you can do get_parameter using gaussian_kernel
 besser82	wiking: are the debug-versions of HDF5 really needed?
 blaubaer_	@iglesiasg, please verify that i am doing the correct thing: i inlined the whole function create_param_tree for simplicity.  now i can call best_combination.get_parameter(param_name, mystic object). what is the mystic object for param_name="C1" to get 1.0?
@wiking	besser82: mmm i dont even know why is it looking for it
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, no idea how can you get C1 since when it is created using ModelSelectionParameters there is no other object given
 blaubaer_	oh
 blaubaer_	btw print best_combination.get_parameter('degree',gaussian_kernel) does not work ether
 blaubaer_	either
@iglesiasg	what about 'kernel',gaussian_kernel?
 besser82	wiking: let me have a look on the .cmake
 blaubaer_	nope
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, is degree of gaussian_kernel, btw?
@iglesiasg	I think it is of power kernel
 blaubaer_	ups
@iglesiasg	width should be of Gaussian
 blaubaer_	no luck again
 blaubaer_	the output of best_params.print_tree() is the following:
 blaubaer_	root "C1"=1.000000 "C2"=2.000000  "kernel":PowerKernel at 0x136e570  "degree"=1.000000  "distance":MinkowskiMetric at 0x125db80  "k"=1.000000
 blaubaer_	so it finds the powerKernel as best kernel with degree 1.0 distance minkowski metric and k=1
 blaubaer_	so shouldn't i be able to access the values without knowing beforehand which kernel will be selected as best?
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, what values?
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@89.204.138.34] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, in best_params only the best should appear, right?
 blaubaer_	values for degree, distance etc
 blaubaer_	yup
@iglesiasg	blaubaer_, so get_parameter("kernel",PowerKernel)
@iglesiasg	should work I guess
@iglesiasg	or power_kernel, I don't remember the name of the variable
 blaubaer_	but if i have to give a kernel object, i must know which one (power?, gaussian?) and that is what i want to find out
 blaubaer_	i initialize the parameter tree with different kernels. one gets selected. i want to find out which one?

@wiking	pickle27: so please tell me how u compiled it
 pickle27	wiking, hmmm I had a bit of a rough go as well
 pickle27	I thought they had posted some new instructions on how to build it
@wiking	i dont care
@wiking	how did u do it
@wiking	it's completely unstable
@wiking	and untested
@wiking	it was a rather bad idea to do this before release
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	elaborate
 pickle27	to be honest I wasn't expecting it be merged for a while
@wiking	how did u compile
@wiking	because now i have to fucking redo this shit
@wiking	on travis
@wiking	buildbots
 pickle27	I seem to recall that I had to have libgsl installed and used their version of blas
@wiking	no fucking way
@wiking	ok
@wiking	this stuff is going to be reverted
@wiking	...
 pickle27	I built on my desktop about a month ago, I need to build on my laptop in the next few days so I can figure it out and get back to you
@wiking	no time for that sorry
 pickle27	honestly thats probably what I would do until they make a deb package for it
 pickle27	even building numpy is a huge mess
@iglesiasg	all right guys, see you later!
 pickle27	wiking, I was planning on just having it as a branch of my own until they released a stable nmatrix
@wiking	ok fucking hell thi sis
@wiking	because this is basically 2 fucking commit
@wiking	s

@wiking	wtf is this?
@HeikoS	ah here we go
@wiking	python --version
@HeikoS	so the thing is
@wiking	what's the version?
@HeikoS	python is installed in/some/dir
@HeikoS	and I added the bin to PATH
@HeikoS	what else do I need to do there?
@wiking	HeikoS: read cmake faq
@wiking	how to set properly paths for python
@wiking	HeikoS: a good start: /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPythonLibs.cmake
@HeikoS	wiking: cool thanks for the hint
@wiking	# If you'd like to specify the installation of Python to use, you should modify
@wiking	# the following cache variables:
@wiking	#  PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
@wiking	#  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found
@HeikoS	wiking: is this also done with this -DPYTHON_LIBRARY?
@wiking	HeikoS: try it
@HeikoS	and how can I see whether this worked apart form compiling?
@HeikoS	I will add these things to the readme afterwards
@wiking	HeikoS: cmake output?
@wiking	or dig somewhere
@wiking	in the udner the build dir
@HeikoS	cmake detects python2.7 for me with running it plan
@HeikoS	thats what it sais
@wiking	well
@wiking	what did it say before?
@wiking	not for the interpreter but for the library

@sonney2k	HeikoS, wiking I am currently building each possible revision of shogun checking sizes
@sonney2k	of libshogun*.so.*
@sonney2k	back in 2012 libshogun was just 105MB
@sonney2k	'just' ...
@sonney2k	now we are at 250MB
@wiking	sonney2k: why do u do hat? :)
@sonney2k	let me try to do some plot
@sonney2k	wiking, well don't you find it a bit suspicious that we had ~100MB with shogun 2.1
@sonney2k	and now have 250?
@wiking	hehehe
@sonney2k	besides the loading time of the library of course
@wiking	sonney2k: striping?
@wiking	sonney2k: and removing -g
@wiking	would help a lot
@sonney2k	wiking, sure but still >20MB
@sonney2k	which is still a lot
@sonney2k	under /usr/lib/ only libwebkit is about the same size
@sonney2k	so we are producing the biggest lib ever o_O
@sonney2k	stupidly I forgot to measure compile time for each release
@wiking	:>
@sonney2k	wiking, and we have like 20% of the commits not compiling btw
@wiking	?

@sonney2k	HeikoS, I find it rahter shocking that we went up from 100MB -> 240MB
@HeikoS	I dont really get the plot
@HeikoS	no descriptions ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, y axis is compiled size of libshogun in MB
@wiking	sonney2k: i guess it's backwards right?
@sonney2k	x is now till november 2012
@sonney2k	all revisions
@wiking	sonney2k: have u used any bundle stuff?
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
@wiking	sonney2k: when u created the librar
@wiking	with cmake
@wiking	-DBUNDLE_*=ON?
@wiking	have u specified any of those?
@sonney2k	wiking, where in this script?
@sonney2k	no that is all still configure based
@wiking	ah ok
@sonney2k	we didn't have cmake back then
@wiking	yeah yeah
@sonney2k	but it certainly explains the increase in compile time
@wiking	now = cmake
@sonney2k	wiking, now is just before cmake
@wiking	ah ok
@sonney2k	now is maybe 10MB higher even
@HeikoS	wow I see
@HeikoS	any ideas where this symbol is found?

@HeikoS	sonney2k: I dont know these commands to well, what would be the full command?
@HeikoS	appreciating your help
@sonney2k	HeikoS, grep amd_printf * --include='*.so.*' -R
@sonney2k	well the first * would be the dir name(s)
@HeikoS	ok so best to look in shared/lib/dir
@sonney2k	grep amd_printf /possible/dir --include='*.so.*' -Rl
@HeikoS	sonney2k: thanks, waiting for output ....
@sonney2k	HeikoS, wiking  - regarding the figure: when we released shogun2.1.0 we were at 121MB
@HeikoS	many undefined symbols when trying to import things ...
@HeikoS	sonney2k: maybe we should start thinking about compiling in modules
@sonney2k	so we doubled the size for some reason (not saying that 121MB is not a lot already...)
@HeikoS	in the way that one only specifys a collection of classes one wants
@HeikoS	and then only the dependencies are compiled
@sonney2k	HeikoS, it won't solve the size problem but sure it makes sense (but it is tough!)

@HeikoS	sonney2k: isnt the file smaller when not everything is compiled?
@HeikoS	and one hardly needs everything
@HeikoS	or is it possble to creat multiple library files?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, all possible and yes
@sonney2k	but if we compile e.g. shogun for a modular interface we need everythong again
@sonney2k	thing
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	damn
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I got another library question
@HeikoS	if I get this here: https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/6468910
@HeikoS	is there a way to fix it without re-linking the library? Which means for me asking the sysadmin to re-install/re-compile
@HeikoS	or can I solve that with LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes it is just missing the proper LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@HeikoS	ok so all I need to find is this file that includes all the symbols?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: is there some way to find the lib files of all missing symbols?
@HeikoS	I dont really know what to google for in that case
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well all of them are name *.so.*
@sonney2k	so just do find /dir -name '*.so.*'

@HeikoS	sonney2k: it did not terminate after 15 mins
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sure takes ages
@HeikoS	sonney2k: the problem is that there are many many .so. files which are conflicting, so maybe the grep is better

@HeikoS	I managed to compile shogun though
@HeikoS	now I just need this scikits.sparse.cholmod module
@HeikoS	and then I am fine
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I found all these files with the right names but .a   what are those doing?
@HeikoS	can I use them?
@HeikoS	statically linked stuff
@sonney2k	HeikoS, no you cannot use them
@sonney2k	these are useful only at compile time

@iglesiasg	Hi all!
@iglesiasg	hushell, out of curiosity, why in your PR did tid changed from a SGString<char> to an int32_t in a few places?

 hushell	iglesiasg: hey, I am back from a football game. Just in time :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, nice! Was it nice?
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah, pretty good, but in US only elder people play football, :(
@iglesiasg	hehe
 hushell	regarding the type id, because I try to maintain a w_map in the factorgraph model
 hushell	so the value in the w_map is the id
 hushell	which is more convenient than a string
 hushell	in that way, I have to use hash map
 hushell	now m_w_map is a vector, has the same length as model weights
@iglesiasg	ok
 hushell	because model parameters are actually stored in FactorType, so I have to define a way to combine them to the global weight vector
 hushell	iglesiasg: I'll update the PR ASAP :) Thanks for the comments!
@iglesiasg	no problem, thanks to you
