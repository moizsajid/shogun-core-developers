@sonney2k	so better keep it (besides it is easier...)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	anyway, I fill first fix the pull request you commented yesterday
 n4nd0	and after that I will do another one for the plifs
@sonney2k	blackburn, there it is: [1]: <U+FEFF>Gretton, A., Fukumizu, K., Teo, C., & Song, L. (2008).
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	where does he get these nice chars?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, thanks
@sonney2k	0 width space!!!
@sonney2k	why did people invent that?
 n4nd0	good night

 blackburn	sonney2k: I need to pass indices to evaluation
 blackburn	any idea?
 blackburn	adding them to evaluate as optional paramers could be badd
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wish we did not had subsets as members in features but as parameter to get_feature_vector etc
@sonney2k	this would save a lot of trouble
 blackburn	sounds ineffective

@sonney2k	(but requires changine *every* learning algorithm)
@sonney2k	blackburn, why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to do subset stack stuff this way?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you give the stacked subset (that is precomputed elsewere)
 blackburn	yeah but as you said this would require changing everytihng
 blackburn	sonney2k: in multitask indexing became a pain for me
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah it is horrible :/
@sonney2k	blackburn, so what do you propose? I mean features and labels support subset stacks
@sonney2k	so in evaluation you can directly use this
 blackburn	I do not propose anything
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	so no problem with indices - just use subset stacks
 blackburn	I think I will add a method that is implemented only in multitask evaluations
 blackburn	and NOP in others
 blackburn	computing the map from test indices to vector of vectors of indices
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need to compute ROC of different tasks separately
 blackburn	so with subset [0,4,5,6,14,15] and tasks [0,1,2,3,4]; [5,6,7,8];[14,15,16] I would need to compute [0,4]; [5,6]; [14,15]

@sonney2k	blackburn, can you do it?
 blackburn	yeah sure
@sonney2k	yhx
@sonney2k	thx

@sonney2k	blackburn, about the c# compile failure
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, in csharp / swig any public variable will get a get_variable() / set_variable() function
@sonney2k	so there is a clash
 blackburn	yes I see
@sonney2k	we cannot have a public get_mean() and a public mean varialbe
 blackburn	good thing to have in python
@sonney2k	what?
 blackburn	I feel tired adding getters/setters sometimes
@sonney2k	I think having getters setters instead of *any* public fields is preferable

@sonney2k	pluskid, actually there are tons of undocumented fields/classes/functions in your code too that the buildbot complains about herehttp://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/276/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%28381%29

@sonney2k	blackburn, konetschno
@sonney2k	pluskid, super fooding!
 pluskid	:D

@sonney2k	n4nd0, and swenglish too!
 gsomix_	sonney2k, Lables and SGVector work,  ta-dam...
 gsomix_	*works
 blackburn	work
@sonney2k	gsomix_, great job!
@sonney2k	gsomix_, what was it?
 gsomix_	sonney2k, strange python behavior
-!- gsomix_ is now known as gsomix
@sonney2k	gsomix, could you explain more?
 blackburn	gsomix consider renaming to m_gsomix according to our code style
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. look, http://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/buffer.html#Py_buffer this is structure, that we fill, when want to use internal buffer.
 gsomix	and only view->internal is guaranteed to remain constant
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	and now?
 gsomix	another pointers may be corrupted
 gsomix	like shape and strides
 gsomix	that I try to delete in releasebuffer
 gsomix	boo
 gsomix	m
 alexlovesdata	printing the draft of my thesis :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok but how do you know when to not delete these fields then?
 alexlovesdata	ok now I have time for you all again O:-)
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, congrats
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: yeah, congrats! that's cool :)
 alexlovesdata	lets see what my prof will say about it :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, now I store this pointers in view->internal.
 gsomix	ugly but works
 blackburn	gsomix: how do you handle unreference?
 gsomix	blackburn, nohow
 blackburn	shouldbe
 blackburn	somehow
 gsomix	maybe it's not needed? ref and unref, I mean
 gsomix	because we have pythno ref/unref
 gsomix	*python
 blackburn	I am unsure we can avoid leaks without ref/unref here
 blackburn	can you put sgvector to the internal?
 blackburn	or at least pointer to the sgvector
 gsomix	yep, I can
 blackburn	hmm then there could be a way
 blackburn	leaving now
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@109.226.80.43] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@sonney2k	gsomix, if you put sgvector in internal then all you have to do to free it is to overwrite it with an empty SGVector
@sonney2k	uricamic, please also have a look at http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/276/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%28381%29 - there are a couple of fields / functions not documented in your code

 n4nd0	sonney2k: what is the bb?
@sonney2k	buildbot
 n4nd0	all right
@sonney2k	heiko, btw a few warnings are also on you http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/283/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/warnings%20%28381%29
@sonney2k	does anyone know where puffin is?
 n4nd0	no idea
@sonney2k	he is the #1 warning producer currently
 heiko	sonny2k, ok thanks for noticing, I will start on warnings tomorrow

@sonney2k	blackburn, what is bigger L1?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well lambda with L1 or anything
@sonney2k	blackburn, lambda == 1/C ?
 blackburn	no, just C analogue
 blackburn	sonney2k: in other words in logistic regression when I regularize more it goes faster
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am curious why SVMs are slower with stronger regularization
 blackburn	in L1 logit regression
@sonney2k	no idea why L1 gets faster - maybe solution is more sparse?
 blackburn	yeah it is
@sonney2k	blackburn, with larger C I meant
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am trying to find an interpretation - is larger C a tighter solution space?
 blackburn	search space I mean
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rd1d2d12 / (3 files in 2 dirs): mention BaseMulticlassMachine in Relaxed tree to get python_modular - http://git.io/q_rIag
@sonney2k	blackburn, for SVM alphas can range from 0...C (so larger space)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh I see
@sonney2k	lets thing loudly
@sonney2k	the higher C the less training errors are tolerated
 blackburn	lets think?
@sonney2k	think!
@sonney2k	so it absolutely tries to have 0 training error
 blackburn	yeah that's clear
 blackburn	stop I am idiot
 blackburn	your lambda=1/C was true :D
 blackburn	I kept wrong thing in mind
 blackburn	in logistic regression I worked with I increase regularization so no surprise it works faster
 blackburn	because it becomes pretty tolerant to errors :D
 blackburn	totally tolerant at some point
@sonney2k	bah :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: probably larger C = more time holds for every loss+regularizer algo
-!- gsomix__ [~gsomix@109.169.158.254] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wouldn't say it is always like this - sometimes larger C creates a much simpler / easier solution (sparser...) and things can go quicker but in general yes
@sonney2k	what you say

@sonney2k	blackburn, do you need this?
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/181/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%281%29
 blackburn	no crap
 blackburn	I will remove
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you again help with this too http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/286/steps/compile%20java_modular/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	needs your macro again
@sonney2k	pluskids code is causing quite some headaches this time :/
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, so?
 blackburn	sonney2k: so bad in java we can't come with a solution without  copying
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah there is no way
@sonney2k	blackburn, even jblas copies...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would already wish we had some way of getting serialization to work for java w/o the exceptions ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you mean w/o exceptions?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it fails because of non sgobjects exposed to interface
 blackburn	actually it is a *test*
 blackburn	:D

@sonney2k	wiking, thx - hope you are otherwise progressing well with your so latent stuff?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah crazy times... wanna get everything PR-ed by this friday
 wiking	so that we can have it a) for pencil down b) next relase
 wiking	rls
@sonney2k	wiking, I need to add - you too have some warnings to fix... http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/287/steps/compile%20python_modular/logs/stdio
 wiking	but just as u seen
@sonney2k	(like everyone here...)
 wiking	i had now a dist-upgrade
@sonney2k	wiking, well good luck - I hope you make it
 wiking	that broke a bit my system for a while
 wiking	but now it's back
