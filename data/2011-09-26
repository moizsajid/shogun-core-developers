 blackburn	sonne|work: have too much spare time on job? :)
 sonne|work	I needed these things...
 sonne|work	and I always forget how to use CTime
 sonne|work	blackburn: ^
 blackburn	I see :)

 BrianC_	Hi
 sonne|work	hi
 BrianC_	Thanks for the fix on set_w
 sonne|work	BrianC_: that was blackburn
 BrianC_	Ah
 BrianC_	I ran into another issue when I compiled that update
 BrianC_	ImportError: /home/mike/brian/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/_modshogun.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun24CStreamingSparseFeaturesIiE11get_featureEi
 sonne|work	how can one reproduce this?
 blackburn	BrianC_: you could try make clean first
 blackburn	or git clean -dfx
 BrianC_	Compile build 9780d20 without xml or hdf5
 blackburn	and reconfigure
 sonne|work	BrianC_: I think blackburn is right
 BrianC_	ah ill give make clean a shot
 BrianC_	I ran into a similar import error related to hdf5 and xml which is why I disabled them in ./configure
 BrianC_	hdf5 and xml import issues were seperate
 sonne|work	BrianC_: please report on the mailinglist (or here)
 BrianC_	same import issue after 'make clean'
 BrianC_	more specifically happens in:
 BrianC_	  File "/home/mike/brian/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 26, in swig_import_helper     _mod = imp.load_module('_modshogun', fp, pathname, description)
 blackburn	ehh
 blackburn	sonne|work: any idea?
 blackburn	BrianC_: did you run configure once more?
 BrianC_	yes
 blackburn	what is the options you gave to configure?
 blackburn	./configure --interfaces=python_modular?
 BrianC_	 --interfaces=python_modular --python=/frodo/shared/epd/bin/python --libs=/frodo/shared/epd/lib/ --includes=/frodo/shared/epd/include/ --disable-xml --disable-hdf5 --prefix=home/mike/brian/
 blackburn	hmm I see
 blackburn	pretty strange..
@sonney2k	BrianC_, I would recommend to really erase the shogun install
@sonney2k	that is any libshogun*.so*
@sonney2k	incl. headers
@sonney2k	and then git clean -dfx and rebuild again
 BrianC_	yeah, i rm -rf lib and include in the prefix directory
@sonney2k	BrianC_, sure that you don't have any libshogun.so lying around in LD_LIBRARY_PATH / usr/lib / usr/local/lib or so?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I sped up compilation now for modular interfaces - we use -O0 for modshogun.so now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've seen, yeah
 BrianC_	sonney2k, I think so.  When I try the same thing with original shogun-1.0.0 it doesnt have import issues (just stops at the set_w)
@sonney2k	BrianC_, hmmhh I am currently running up-to-date git
 BrianC_	oh i didnt install git,i just downloaded the commit from github.com
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r0cadbbd / (7 files in 6 dirs): Merge branch 'master' of github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun - http://git.io/hCGicw
@sonney2k	BrianC_, maybe just try again with latest snapshot
@sonney2k	however I would say it should work...
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r32b654e / (2 files): add two more c# examples translated by daniel - http://git.io/VEGezw
 BrianC_	hmm
 BrianC_	i do notice that ldconfig make[1]: ldconfig: Command not found make[1]: [install-libshogun] Error 127 (ignored)
 BrianC_	is happening in my make install

 blackburn	sonney2k: hey we got posted on google opensource
@sonney2k	blackburn, great :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: fame :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, put this in your CV :)
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: it raises our chances to get into next gsoc
 blackburn	I think :)
@sonney2k	I hope that we can do several nice things even w/o btw :)
@sonney2k	but yes another gsoc infusion would be great!
 blackburn	sonney2k: the most significant part of my project is done in september haha
 blackburn	was done
@sonney2k	at least you did it :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: how are buffer protocol things?
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about adding benchmarks to shogun?
@sonney2k	benchmarks are good
@sonney2k	didn't work on the array interface
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just noticed parallel LTSA doesn't take advantage of multiple threads :(
 blackburn	I was pretty sure it does
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah libsvm didn't gain much either
@sonney2k	at some point everything is in kernel cache
@sonney2k	and then it doesn't help
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think mfpmath=sse can affect on parallel things?
@sonney2k	I dont' think so
 blackburn	bad bad :(
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r95c854a / src/shogun/preprocessor/HessianLocallyLinearEmbedding.cpp : BLASed HLLE - http://git.io/YmMa8w
 blackburn	see you
 blackburn	daily plan works
 blackburn	:D
