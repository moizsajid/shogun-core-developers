 blackburn	sonney2k: I think we should release 1.0.0.1 or so?
 blackburn	or 1.0.1
 blackburn	cause 1.0.0 is too bad to package
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn  * rdb0d2a4 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/lle_auto_k.py : Fixed lle_auto_k python graphical example - http://git.io/OF7GEw
 shogun-buildbot	build #214 of ruby_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/ruby_modular/builds/214
@sonney2k	blackburn, but we changed too much didn't we?
 blackburn	sonney2k: in comparison to what?
@sonney2k	I think we need to get octave_modular examples to work too
@sonney2k	there are 2 still crashing
 blackburn	yeah we should get all the things work
 blackburn	and release 1.0.1
 blackburn	and then start packaging again
 blackburn	1.0.0 have some critical things (like arpack compile error reported today again)
@sonney2k	I would call it 1.1
@sonney2k	but I would prefer that we have osx/ cygwin working too before we release
@sonney2k	note that you changed preprocessors completely (converters ...)
@sonney2k	so it is certainly no longer a bugfix release
@sonney2k	the alternative of course is to do a 1.0.1 with lots of small install / bugfixes only
@sonney2k	but that is quite some work too (figuring out all the missing patches + testing)
@sonney2k	so I prefer a 1.1 release
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I tried to do the .cxx splitting
@sonney2k	it is easy when splitting the file in two halves to compile just the first halve
@sonney2k	but the second *uh* *oh*
@sonney2k	this cries for some automated magic
@sonney2k	with putting defines or so in headers; repeat static functions; extern other used globabl functions
 blackburn	sorry was away
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's a lot of work to do.. (about .cxx)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes I know...
@sonney2k	but I guess it cannot really be avoided
@sonney2k	maybe a python helper script can do the job
@sonney2k	I might underestimate its complexity though...
@sonney2k	I would probably proceed by defining some list of function/struct/... names, and a dictionary of function/struct// names with the name as key and the content as value
@sonney2k	and then annotate things with static / whatever
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess yes, you underestimate
@sonney2k	and then try to traverse the file in order and add header files for functions that are defined non-static
@sonney2k	and put them all in the .h
@sonney2k	and for static ones put them in both
@sonney2k	blackburn, how do you know
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	just think so
@sonney2k	I mean it would be nice to have a splitcpp.py anyways or?
 blackburn	sure, I hope this can be done
@sonney2k	I mean swig uses no templates
@sonney2k	it is more C style
 blackburn	template<typename T> class SwigValueWrapper {
 blackburn	???
@sonney2k	so all it can do are functions/structs/classes/defines
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	indeed
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know virtual can't be inlined?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	where can I find that info?
 blackburn	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/733737/are-inline-virtual-functions-really-a-non-sense
@sonney2k	so they are inlined most of the time
 blackburn	I don't know exactly
@sonney2k	well if the type is know which it is when we do e.g. CGaussianKernel k
@sonney2k	k->get_name()
 blackburn	sonney2k: well that's not a serious trouble anyway
 blackburn	we have a lot of other overhead
@sonney2k	I don't think we have much overhead
@sonney2k	actually close to no overhead :)
 blackburn	okay, in means of large-scale
 blackburn	calling another function one more time is not that bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: had you throwed away that python buffer integration?
@sonney2k	I never wrote it
@sonney2k	bug #1 is now memory requirements for me
@sonney2k	for compiling
 blackburn	I mean did you stop working on it?
 blackburn	well yes it is much more important now
@sonney2k	for now yes, bugs have highest prio as well as user reports
@sonney2k	then wrapper splitting somehow
@sonney2k	and then new features
 blackburn	av3ngr suffered with strange bug
 blackburn	I've recommended to clean git, etc
 blackburn	nothing helped
@sonney2k	yeah but I have no idea for that either. no one has this...
@sonney2k	anyway bed time
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	wrote some question to you and erased :D
 blackburn	I probably will try to do some MKL with images classification
 blackburn	as my bachelor's 'work'
@sonney2k	not sure if MKL is that useful ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: well that was a question, do you know any success of MKL?
