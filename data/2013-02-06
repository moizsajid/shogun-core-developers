 heiko	sonney2k, around?
 heiko	had phd interviews over the last week - the reason why I was invisible.
 heiko	I was just wondering about the call for proposals for the workshop, when should we send this out, what should be in there?
 heiko	let me know what you think on this
@sonney2k	heiko, hey
 heiko	hi
@sonney2k	heiko, gunnar is hiding from me so before I get hold of him I cannot do more
@sonney2k	heiko, btw I am just investigating evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl.cpp
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am afraid that pull request is rather for you :(
@sonney2k	it fails with assertation < 0.9 accuracy
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes I saw that
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/857
 heiko	sonney2k, I am a bit confused since this used to work
@sonney2k	heiko, who did add this? does it make sense?
 heiko	sonney2k, well just as a check that no nonsense is returned, I evaluated the accuracy, and then simply added this check which was a lower bound on the accuracy
 heiko	so if it fails this means that something has changed
 heiko	and this way, a few problems with the labels were detected
 heiko	so I consider it quite useful, however, remove it if it doesnt make sense or something
@sonney2k	heiko, do you know what accuracy is possible w/ e.g. a 3 class mc svm?
@sonney2k	heiko, this example is rather advanced... mkl & multiclass and ... so hmmh
 heiko	but the data is fixed right?
@sonney2k	heiko, it trains on the full data set and then does some stratified x-val again on this dataset giving out accuracy
 heiko	I agree that through x-.validation, we cannot be sure what the accuacy is
 heiko	however, in practice, it makes still sense to check for reasonable accuracy
 heiko	But agreed that 0.9 is too large
 heiko	I will change it to 0.7 or 0.6
 heiko	or even remove it
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, on thing, in lapack.h, can I change line 31 to #include <atlas/cblas.h> ? Would that work on your systems? On mine, it does not compile otherwise
 blackburn	heiko: it seems to be little wrong
 blackburn	heiko: do you have -I/usr/include/atlas in your .config?
 heiko	no
 blackburn	but you have -DHAVE_ATLAS, right?
 heiko	yes
 blackburn	interesting
 heiko	I will just create a link on my system then
 blackburn	heiko: so that's ubuntu?
 heiko	yep, any I haven't changed anything, it just stopped working a while ago
 blackburn	heiko: did you re-configure recently?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	often
 heiko	in fact just a minute ago
 blackburn	sad
@sonney2k	heiko, no that is not what I meant - what accuracy is possible?
 heiko	sonney2k, how do you  mean that?
@sonney2k	heiko, if 0.9 is very well possible then this assertion is valid
@sonney2k	heiko, about your atlas issue... I have -I/usr/include/atlas in my .config. could you paste your configure.log?
 heiko	sonney2k, I dont know, but I certainly would not have added this if I did not get these values. Cannot remember however, so I just changed it to 0.65 instead
 heiko	sure
@sonney2k	heiko, well no then don't change it
 heiko	sonney2k, there were problems with labels before, causing wrong x-validation results
@sonney2k	heiko, which test test for this?
@sonney2k	or how can we be sure that we don't have this issue again?
 heiko	well, those accuracy assertions are a straight forward way to at least ensure that no nonsense comes out (assert that performance is better than random or similar)
 heiko	but in general, we can only be sure if we finally start writing tests for our code ;)  for which I was a bit overoptimistic regarding time to do this
@sonney2k	very true
 heiko	any updates on the gtest framework btw?
 blackburn	it is not the matter of framework I believe
@sonney2k	heiko, that is wiking's domain
 heiko	I know, just wondering whether there was progress
@sonney2k	heiko, wiking was/is busy with real life stuff
 heiko	sonney2k, here is my configure.log
 heiko	http://pastebin.com/PKtumAuR
 heiko	sonney2k, who isn't :)
 heiko	I finally managed to have two jobs at once :D
@sonney2k	heiko, stupid you
@sonney2k	get rid of one
@sonney2k	there is no need to get a burn out before becoming 30
 blackburn	ooh two jobs nice
 blackburn	hah heiko is near IIRC
 heiko	sonney2k, in two months, and its two 50% ones, but you know how that is - at least I will get my name on some nice papers :)
 heiko	sonney2k, no risk of burn out here, I am quite relaxed
 heiko	take my time to rest etcetc
 blackburn	I am dying with two areas I am trying to succeed
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	heiko, your c++ compiler is weird
 heiko	what going on?
@sonney2k	it shouldn't compile this test
 heiko	no idea
 heiko	what about the atlas issue ?
@sonney2k	that is your atlas issue
 heiko	I see
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	so?
 heiko	re-install ubuntu? :D
 heiko	this is usually how I fix those thing
 heiko	s
@sonney2k	lets try -Werror-implicit-function-declaration
 heiko	where to add this best?
@sonney2k	heiko, sec
 heiko	ok
@sonney2k	heiko, please pull and test
 heiko	sonney2k, ok
 heiko	give me a minute, just committing some other thinfs
@sonney2k	heiko, check if -I/usr/include/atlas appears in your .config
 heiko	sonney2k,
 heiko	cat .config  | grep atlas
 heiko	POSTLINKFLAGS=  -lm -pthread -lhdf5 -ljson   -lxml2   -llapack -lcblas -llapack_atlas -larpack -lglpk -lm -llzo2 -lz -lbz2
 heiko	from shogun/src
 heiko	building from latest pull now
 heiko	sonney2k, compiled just fine, you fixed it :)

@sonney2k	wiking, could you fix travis?
@sonney2k	it is giving weird erros
@sonney2k	and is useless currently
 blackburn	I can
 blackburn	uhm
 blackburn	illegal instruction
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd expect we should turn off optimizations
@sonney2k	blackburn, so it is a bug in clang?
@sonney2k	in any case we should turn of optimzations for travis - speeds up compilation...
 blackburn	sonney2k: it happen to me with -O4 once
 blackburn	yes agree
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess it is enough to edit .travis.yml?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes already done
@sonney2k	oops
@sonney2k	me too
 blackburn	sonney2k: irc notify disappeared
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw we could pull travis status to readme like in tapkee: https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee (line before Interface header)
@sonney2k	I don't understand why thogh

 blackburn	sonney2k: what would you say if I said I want to CMake shogun totally?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would say you have too much spare time
 blackburn	true
 blackburn	but it would be nice still
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah yes, we need gsoc meeting
@sonney2k	question is do we want to participate this year?
@sonney2k	there hasn't been a lot of activity here ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: whoa?
 blackburn	activity like?
@sonney2k	blackburn, well if we don't have the time to get the build green how can we mentor students *and* keep the build green?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can get time to manage students
 blackburn	winter is tough (and it was tough twice IIRC)
 blackburn	it is not a question for me - gsoc-boosted we can keep doing some changes
@sonney2k	blackburn, would you do the gsoc admin this year then?
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure
 blackburn	if you don't have time I'll back you up
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean we should not rely on me this year

-!- heiko [~heiko@pat-191-250.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea - irc notifications just don't want to work
 blackburn	sonney2k: github.
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you want gsoc - start creating a list now and invite everyone to a meeting
@sonney2k	announce it on the mailinglist etc
@sonney2k	you know the drill :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes once gsoc is announced
 blackburn	sonney2k: but I'd need contacts of all possible mentors
@sonney2k	blackburn, no *before* gsoc is announced
 blackburn	why before?
@sonney2k	very important to do everything before
 blackburn	how can I announce we are participating in something that is not announced yet?
@sonney2k	blackburn, don't announce that we participate but that we want to and are looking for mentors/subjects
 blackburn	ah that's ok
 blackburn	I'll write an mail tomorrow's morning
 blackburn	sonney2k: you settled some mentors at summit, right?
 blackburn	well, possibilities
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd need contacts or mail to them from you
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
 blackburn	no what?
@sonney2k	first discuss on the mailinglist
@sonney2k	this has time
 blackburn	yes - but then someone should ask they if deal is here still
@sonney2k	yes later
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know anything on compressive sensing?
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	just about - I read some blog on that by igor carron
 blackburn	I'll ask him in person if he can guide in compressive sensing
