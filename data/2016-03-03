@HeikoS	anjan_ hi there
@HeikoS	yes there are
@HeikoS	have a look at the ideas list

 anjan	Thanks but how would I know which ones are for starters?
@HeikoS	anjan: you will have to read for yourself,
 anjan	They all seem so complicated.How would I start?
@HeikoS	anjan: pick something that interests you
@HeikoS	we will help you in the projects
@HeikoS	for now, start with something very simple and try to send a patch
@HeikoS	think which projects excites you most
 anjan	Okay Thank You a lot
@HeikoS	anjan: we are mostly looking for motivated ppl
@HeikoS	so if you show that, you are a good candidate!
@HeikoS	and people who know a bit how to code and are fascinated in ML
@HeikoS	btw all this is stated in the getting involved guide :)
 anjan	I ve never contributed to Open source in my life bcz I spent time in learning ML.Now it is time to do something.So what would improve my chances of working with Shogun?
@HeikoS	anjan: reading the getting involved guide ;)
@HeikoS	and following its steps
@HeikoS	send a patch
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: around?
 anjan	Thank You  , I ll start contributing right away.

@HeikoS	sonne|work1: jo
@HeikoS	all good?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi I have a question about swig and templates
@HeikoS	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/113156216#L2989
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	the problem is that the method is templated
@HeikoS	but I want to avoid adding for all the types
@HeikoS	thats the point of having a seperate array type, and not just wrap by hand
 lisitsyn	which method?
@HeikoS	append_wrapped
@HeikoS	in WrappedObjectArray.h
 lisitsyn	is templated
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you've got to export available template implementations then
@HeikoS	can they have the same name?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just like DenseFeatures<float> -> RealDenseFeatures
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: because avoiding that was the whole point
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I just want an overloaded method
 lisitsyn	the member functino should work I think
@HeikoS	but that is not possible?
@HeikoS	I could not make it work so far :(
@HeikoS	tried many things

@wiking	lisitsyn: ho
 lisitsyn	wiking: hey
@wiking	lisitsyn: so basically 1 thing: should we update liblinear in shogun
@wiking	maybe even with this
@wiking	https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/multicore-liblinear/
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah in the swig doc they always rename it
@wiking	i dont know why i cannot tab Heiko
@wiking	(because he got disconnected \o/
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes exactly
 lisitsyn	had to write it down manually

@wiking	HeikoS: fuck
@wiking	your eigen thing is broken
 lisitsyn	merged yet?
@wiking	noup
 sonne|work1	HeikoS: I don't think that this is possible... well you could use void* of course and possibly typecheck typemaps to determine the right type
@HeikoS	wiking: lets fix it then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this means we need to put the results into wrappers
@HeikoS	which means we have to infer types ,which is crap
@HeikoS	since we cannot
 lisitsyn	sonne|work1: but swig's constructors can be overloaded, right?
 sonne|work1	lisitsyn: not sure what you mean...
 lisitsyn	A(int x)
 lisitsyn	A(float x)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work1: would it work then?
 sonne|work1	sure
 lisitsyn	ok
 sonne|work1	you need typecheck typemaps then
 lisitsyn	meeeh
 sonne|work1	to determine the right e.g. python type <-> C type
 sonne|work1	but we have them already...
 sonne|work1	for many types
 sonne|work1	I know that java can do
 sonne|work1	int A()
 sonne|work1	float A()
 lisitsyn	covariant types
 sonne|work1	I don't think that will work with python/C
 sonne|work1	anyways gtg
 sonne|work1	cu
 lisitsyn	won't
@HeikoS	bye
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what do we do?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we can just start by only enabling it for cpp
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah lets just use it for cpp now
@HeikoS	is not too much work to enable this once the other ones work
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	I wil think about it a bit
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	btw no workshop this year?
@wiking	if yes i vote pre-june
@wiking	otherwise i'm no tin eu
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe a hack
@HeikoS	wiking: lambday comes to london soon
