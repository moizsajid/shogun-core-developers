@sonney2k	blackburn, look https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/428
@sonney2k	heiko did it again :)
 blackburn	karlnapf: you rock
@sonney2k	karlnapf, why does x-val get slower
 karlnapf	sonney2k, blackburn, hi, thanks :)
 karlnapf	sonney2k, because a subset is pushed in every fold, and then the active subset has to be recomputed
 karlnapf	that creates some overhead
 karlnapf	esp for large number of folds, large number of repetitions compared to small amount of data (as in examples)
 blackburn	what is overhead?
@sonney2k	karlnapf, I would prefer 'add_subset' / 'remove_subset' just because we use the same terms with add_kernel / add_feature ...
 karlnapf	but should not be noticable in large scale real world examples
 karlnapf	sonney2k, ok I can change this
 blackburn	I thought this overhead is rather light
@sonney2k	karlnapf, but isn't this a NOP when there is just 1 subset?
@sonney2k	I mean it doesn't need to recompute anything or?
 karlnapf	oh yes, true
 karlnapf	I should add that :)
 karlnapf	currently it does (copy)
 karlnapf	blackburn, I just noticed that for my examples it takes a bit longer
@sonney2k	karlnapf, nice work!
@sonney2k	do these 'fixes' and TODO's and merge at your own will :D

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey! thank you for your answer, but I didn't get any qda file in data/testsuite/tests
 n4nd0	maybe there is something wrong in my configuration
 wiking	n4nd0: have you checked out the submodule?
 wiking	git submodule init && git submodule update
 n4nd0	wiking: the only thing I have done related to the submodule is
 n4nd0	git submodule update --init
 n4nd0	I did that in my shogun local repository in order to set up the data directories
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	well that should do it
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@157.159.42.154] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	oh wait
 n4nd0	I have these files
 wiking	and there's nothing in data/testsuite/tests ?
 n4nd0	./tests/classifier_qda_modular1.txt
 n4nd0	./tests/classifier_qda_modular0.txt
 wiking	there should be at least 276 files
 n4nd0	where . is shogun/data/testsuite
 n4nd0	I understood it wrong, I was looking into my shogun-data repository
 wiking	if not more since i haven't updated my repo for a while...
 n4nd0	so it looks like shogun/data is another repository right?
 n4nd0	my git understands it like that at least

 blackburn	wiking: what are your thoughts on that?
 wiking	i mean opencl it self has a standardized api
 wiking	just like opengl
 blackburn	ah yes
 wiking	so currently i really don't see way is it necessary to add an extra abstraction layer to it
 wiking	i mean yes
 wiking	it for sure makes easier the implementation
 wiking	but then it's just another library dependency u will need if u want support for it
 blackburn	yes I agree
 blackburn	wiking: did you submit a proposal in time? ;)

 n4nd0	blackburn: I see, I was going to ask you about this data submodule stuff, but it can wait so no problem ;)
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, ask :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: so I've noticed that after doing this git submodule update --init
 n4nd0	blackburn: I get like another repository in shogun/data
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: I mean another repository because when I am in another directory of the project I see the branch where I'm (qda) and when I am under shogun/data I see another branch's name
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	it is another repo
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so how should I manage it?
 n4nd0	for example this morning I did with tester.py
 n4nd0	I generated a new example for qda
 blackburn	probably you'd need to fork it too
 blackburn	sounds crazy I know
 n4nd0	I see now a couple of new files classifier_qda_modular0.txt
 n4nd0	and the same with modular1
 n4nd0	mmm but actually I forked shogun-data
 n4nd0	I have it locally
 n4nd0	but it is in another directory in my machine than the one I was telling you
 n4nd0	in one placed I hace the forked I did of shogun-data
 n4nd0	and inside shogun I have this shogun/data/ repository
 n4nd0	I don't know if that really makes sense
 blackburn	ohh
 blackburn	probably you need to do PR with your shogun-data fork
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	but in my shogun-data fork it is not where I can see these new files+
 n4nd0	this is getting weird :P
 blackburn	just put your files to your fork
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	once your PR is merged I'll update data hash in main shogun repo
 blackburn	and it would be ok
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I'll move the files and do the PR now, first I'll rebase and that stuff
 n4nd0	btw I checked the contents of these files
 n4nd0	really cryptic
 CIA-64	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra553686 / src/shogun/classifier/svm/NewtonSVM.cpp : Proper memory handling for #409 - http://git.io/n0rgBQ
 blackburn	yeah but it would be worse to have data in the main repo
 wiking	blackburn: heheh yes i did :)
 blackburn	that's nice then
 n4nd0	blackburn: oh sorry, I think that was confusing ... I meant that the contents of these files (classifier_qda_modular[01].txt) I generated for the testsuite are really weird
 n4nd0	blackburn: I cannot understand them at least
 blackburn	hmmm
 n4nd0	I suppose it has something to do with serialization
 blackburn	n4nd0: is it similar to others ?
 n4nd0	let me check
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it is as weird as classifier_knn_modular0.txt for example
 blackburn	all ok then
 blackburn	;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you know sth about how the contents of these files work?
 n4nd0	S?ren told me yesterday that it would be useful if I work with the testsuite, trying to fix the errors
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes it is pickle
 n4nd0	blackburn: python serialization right?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	the thing is that with S?ren's suggestion, when some test is wrong, I execute the tester like this
 n4nd0	./tester.py -d wrong_test.py
 n4nd0	that basically shows me the contents of those files
 n4nd0	I don't know how one is supposed to find the errors from the contents there
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	no way
 blackburn	did he suggest to compare the outputs? he was pretty tired probably hah
-!- PhilTillet [~android@92.90.20.8] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok if seriously you probably would need to read this stuff and compare parameters
 n4nd0	blackburn: but I think that stuff is not readable at all :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: check for example these new ones https://github.com/iglesias/shogun-data/commit/e0c8878d2515e94cf7997c3f22df7bfaca3bd00d
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	-d should show some detailed sutff
 n4nd0	that is what I get when I do -d
 n4nd0	without -d is just ERROR
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	something is wrong there then
 blackburn	check compare_dbg function
 blackburn	hmmm
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	line 57 is kinda stupid
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok I think we need to change examples that return SGObjects
 blackburn	that makes no sense to me to compare that
 n4nd0	blackburn: it makes no sense to me either
 n4nd0	blackburn: also I think that something must be missing because S?ren told me sth like
 blackburn	n4nd0: but numpy array compare is ok
 n4nd0	with -d you can do debu
 n4nd0	debug sorry
 n4nd0	with print a you can print object a
 n4nd0	with print b you can print object b
 n4nd0	I have not entered in that kind of debug mode though :(
 blackburn	yeah reading pickle is kind of mastery

 PhilTillet	blackburn, I think there is still a "float64_t" cast in the buggy pull request i sent a few weeks ago ( CMath::dot(float32_t*,float32_t*,int32_t))
 blackburn	really? why?
 PhilTillet	I don't know, I rebased the upstream but there was still a float64_t cast
 PhilTillet	even though dsdot was back to sdot
 blackburn	due to performance reasons we changed it back to sdot
 PhilTillet	yes
 blackburn	so what is the problem? :)
 PhilTillet	int he for loop there is still the float64_t cast
 PhilTillet	which halves performances :p
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	do you think it should be removed?
 PhilTillet	yes, I tested without it and peformances for float doubled :p
 PhilTillet	I think multiplying a float with a double is a bad idea with SSE
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	however on my machine blas is used probably
 PhilTillet	hmm, you probably have #define HAVE_LAPACK

@sonney2k	blackburn, I just learned that scikits-learn got 3 proposals
 n4nd0	I am taking a look to the seg fault someone pointed out in the mailing list if you are not with it guys
@sonney2k	harshit_, now yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: they just got three proposals!?
@sonney2k	yes I guess these 3 are of high quality thouh!
@sonney2k	though
@sonney2k	so everyone will be in
 n4nd0	yeah sure ... but I don't know
@sonney2k	I would say we have 10-15 HQ students - I am still not through the whole list
 n4nd0	what does HQ stand for? high quality maybe?
@sonney2k	yeah
 n4nd0	ok

 CIA-64	shogun: Merge pull request #429 from iglesias/qda
 CIA-64	shogun: QDA for python_modular's testsuite - http://git.io/R3hi_Q
@sonney2k	n4nd0, did you understand a bit better how the testsuite is supposed to work?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: well, just a little bit
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I still don't really understand how one is supposed to fix the tests that are wrong :S
 harshit_	sonney2k: Need to know how CDotFeatures operates internally ,
 harshit_	As in I am implementing LBP features, so when user creates ClbpFeatures object by giving images and other argument, Then do I need to compute corresponding LBP feautes for those images there and then only ?
 harshit_	or create LBP feature representation for one image when user request it .
@sonney2k	n4nd0, the way I do it is run tester.py -d bad_test.py
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but the output there is quite unreadable
@sonney2k	then when things are not the same I have these two lists a and b to investigate
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you work with that kind of format?
@sonney2k	well I can see what is different
@sonney2k	if things are numpy arrays I can compute the deviation, e.g. numpy.max(numpy.abs(a[1]-b[1]))
@sonney2k	or so
@sonney2k	the only thing where it is difficult is SGObjects
 n4nd0	sonney2k: oh ok
@sonney2k	for these I do pickle.dumps(a[1]) etc
@sonney2k	and then have a general llok
@sonney2k	look
@sonney2k	for SGObjects one can see though which arrays should be the same
 n4nd0	sonney2k: let me show you just in case, http://snipt.org/uhoj1
@sonney2k	so for example if a[0] and b[0] are two objects derived from CSVM I can check if they are the same by computing the objective
 n4nd0	sonney2k: that is the kind of output one should wait for?
@sonney2k	well not the same actually - they might deviate slightly due to different numerical libs etc
@sonney2k	so I mark this as ok and run generator.py badscript.py
 n4nd0	I see
@sonney2k	wait how do you get that output
 n4nd0	./tester.py -d classifier_larank_modular.py
@sonney2k	(but answer is yes if you do p a[0] and a[0] is an sgobject)
 n4nd0	I choose that file because tester.py detects it as ERROR
@sonney2k	dammed some import pdb / pdb.set_trace() is missing
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	that is probably why I didn't see this interactive menu you told me about
 n4nd0	to do print a, print b and so on
@sonney2k	looks like when I added these -m etc flags I did trash the pdb stuff
 harshit_	sonney2k: In matlab example in libsvmocas for lbpfeatures, what is the format of image matrix, row major or column major
@sonney2k	harshit_, things are already halve in shogun btw LBPPyrDotFeatures.h
 n4nd0	harshit_: AFAIK images coordinates are normally (0,0) for the top left corner and (M,N) for the bottom right
@sonney2k	harshit_, I am not sure - better ask vojtech about it (he is the author)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah but you never know ...
 n4nd0	harshit_: do you know if the images represent something you can see?
 harshit_	sonney2k: okay i'll ask vojtech about format of it .. but can you tell me how exactly you want lbppyrDotFeatures need to be rebuilt
 n4nd0	harshit_: if so, you could try to represent them with imagesc
 harshit_	n4nd0: they are in a mat file
 n4nd0	harshit_: that could give you a clue about the coordinates
 harshit_	7400*500
 n4nd0	harshit_: I meant if they are images of, idk, of horses for example
 harshit_	500 is the no of features
 n4nd0	harshit_: ok, so we are talking about feature vectors no raw images
 harshit_	I dont know whether they are real images are not, have to ask vojtech
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r418a6b5 / testsuite/python_modular/tester.py : enter debug mode for tester when -d is specified - http://git.io/sKn36g
@sonney2k	n4nd0,  now have a look again
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actually this particular svm you are testing is probabilistic...
@sonney2k	so it is no wonder this test fails...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aham! that would be make it more difficult to get the same output ...
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	yeah, now I get the pdb promt, cool
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so now you could do p a[0].get_labels()
@sonney2k	and see the values
 PhilTillet	Hello everybody :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thank you .9
 n4nd0	ups
 n4nd0	:)
 PhilTillet	.9 is a pretty neat smiley :p

@sonney2k	if we get only 3 slots we are in serious trouble
@sonney2k	anyways we will know on april 11
 blackburn	no way
 blackburn	april 11?
 blackburn	sonney2k: why they would give us less than last year?
@sonney2k	april 11 end of workday / pacific time
 blackburn	wow they are pretty fast
 n4nd0	sonney2k: will you let us know how many we get?
@sonney2k	sure
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	however there is a waiting list
@sonney2k	it might be apr 12 though
 blackburn	that would become nervous if he didn't say that
 n4nd0	I hope at least for 5
 n4nd0	you got 5 last year and everyone succeeded
 n4nd0	I think it's fair
@sonney2k	I can actually enter how many amazing proposals we have (the pure minimum of #slots we want)
@sonney2k	and how many we would want if there were inf slots available
 blackburn	sonney2k: enter to?
@sonney2k	problem is that I am not through all the proposals yet so it is hard to say
@sonney2k	enter to melange
 blackburn	are there special fields for that?
@sonney2k	yes
 gsomix	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/3Ni2yX8p and http://pastebin.com/Wiumz3qv
 blackburn	sonney2k: and what do you think is a minimum?
@sonney2k	independent of that each mentor can score students and there is some (hidden) discussion going on among mentors about students
 gsomix	hi all
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know yet I would guess 7-9
 blackburn	sonney2k: heh and maximum is 9?
@sonney2k	lets be realistic
 blackburn	sonney2k: your opinion on that is changed ;)
@sonney2k	we only have 10 mentors
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you mean?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yesterday you told me you think chances are we get 7-8 slots or so
 blackburn	and now you think about 3 even :)
@sonney2k	and?
@sonney2k	no I don't think about 3
 blackburn	okay ;)
@sonney2k	I am just saying 3 would be catastrophic
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	4,5 as well
@sonney2k	then it is like rolling a dice to chose one of the very good students
@sonney2k	anyway since they will announce on apr 11 - I am under high pressure to actually get mentors to do sth over easter vacations
@sonney2k	not easy - I was hoping we have the tuesday too
 blackburn	do you really need these rates? I mean you would have to choose ideas rather than students applying for the same idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: btw did you see mailing list? pluskid suggested about using smart pointers as we talked about
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what do you think about it?
 blackburn	I have no opinion/expertise on that
 n4nd0	blackburn: it's ok to be gay and use garbage collection :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: too gay
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'll never forget that man
 n4nd0	lol
 blackburn	n4nd0: that video?
 blackburn	have you seen azis btw?
 n4nd0	blackburn: both the video and your answer :D azis?
 blackburn	oh you haven't seen that
 blackburn	ok a min
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4hQ4J4BFOM&feature=player_detailpage
 blackburn	that's probably the most gay video in the universe
 gsomix	azis *__*
 n4nd0	talking about see, since we are in easter I think we all deserve a rest and watch star wars
 n4nd0	telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
 blackburn	ah yeah I remember that
 n4nd0	blackburn: that video looks pretty hardcore, not a good moment to see it in the living room with other people .P
 blackburn	n4nd0: hahahah lol
 n4nd0	wtf is wrong with my keyboard today
 n4nd0	:P
 n4nd0	that's better
 blackburn	probably not the best video to show gf's family
 blackburn	oh lolz
 blackburn	I imagine how could they react
 gsomix	blackburn, have you seen the clip `Hop'? :3
 blackburn	is it as gay as azis is?
 blackburn	gsomix: no, I can't remember that
 blackburn	I prefer hardcore gay video
 PhilTillet	blackburn, like justin bieber?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: exactly I am a belieber lol
 PhilTillet	lol
 PhilTillet	omg Azis.
 PhilTillet	I did not know about him.
 blackburn	gsomix: while moving upstairs 15 minutes before I was thinking how to overload you a little more
 gsomix	blackburn, and..?
 blackburn	gsomix: do you think it would be interesting for you to get shogun well-known in the .ru zone?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: lucky
 PhilTillet	would be great if one day one gay commit had a sha1 starting with F4hQ4J4BFOM
 blackburn	probably it is the task for me but it would be useful for you
 gsomix	blackburn, what do you mean? site? advertising?
 blackburn	gsomix: e.g. there is no russian page on Shogun in wiki
 blackburn	however python3 stuff and other are in prior
 blackburn	gsomix: habrahabr would work as well :)
 gsomix	blackburn, hmm. I can translate article from English.
@sonney2k	google translate can too :D
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	ok let me describe my intention
 blackburn	but I am already used to some writing
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rc835442 / (2 files):
 CIA-64	shogun: convert the float32 based dot function to return float32 - no need for
 CIA-64	shogun: float64_t inflasion - http://git.io/NVPVzA
 blackburn	I can do that for sure
 blackburn	but you are not yet so it would be useful
 blackburn	sonney2k: that function has been popular last days
* PhilTillet feels embarassed
 blackburn	gsomix: so what do you think?
 gsomix	sonney2k, Hulk sad. However, I translate better than I write. :)
 blackburn	gsomix: the more you do things the better you do it
 blackburn	year ago sonney2k usually had a headache while understanding my english
 gsomix	blackburn, can we discuss details in private?

 gsomix	hmm
 blackburn	bad connection
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think we need to establish that # referring in github commits
 blackburn	however risk is that we could forgot to refer issues too often
 blackburn	one way to avoid this is to restrict commits w/o #
 blackburn	i.e. any commit should go to some issue
 blackburn	n4nd0: what do you think?
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you mean to use symbols for the commits?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, e.g. all doc things should go to #408
 blackburn	once you add #408 to the commit msg
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/418
 blackburn	#418 sorry
 blackburn	it goes to the issue
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, but later the commits can be added as usual, using PRs?
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	however..
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please fix some doc and commit with #418?
 blackburn	probably it is only for me, Soeren and heiko commits
 n4nd0	I should go something like
 blackburn	I am curious whether it will appear in both PR and issue
 n4nd0	fix doc #418 right?
 blackburn	yeah something blablba #418
 n4nd0	blackburn: done, in my branch qda
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it looks like it is included in Documentation improvements
 n4nd0	I think that is cool
 blackburn	that's nice
 n4nd0	but anyway
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/418
 n4nd0	how does this work to merge later?
 blackburn	it does nothing with merge/etc
 blackburn	just groups commits
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	jo the method is the same
 n4nd0	do pull requests apart
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	I like it
 blackburn	me too
 blackburn	I will suggest it using the ML

 blackburn	gsomix: already? nice work
 gsomix	blackburn, http://pastebin.com/Wiumz3qv
 blackburn	gsomix: is it a proof that it works?
 gsomix	blackburn, yep.
 blackburn	I believe it works ;)
 blackburn	gsomix: so you need next task?
 gsomix	blackburn, yep.
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	gsomix: you prefer hardcore tasks, right? ;)
 gsomix	blackburn, yep. for example, a researching of this: http://xkcd.com/323/
 gsomix	:]
 blackburn	I've never heard of your alco addiction ;)
 gsomix	blackburn, hehe. it's a joke.
 blackburn	mine addict is not ;(
 blackburn	gsomix: I know that custom kernel is wrong
 blackburn	exact problem is in triangular from full
 blackburn	or vice versa
 PhilTillet	blackburn, I'm looking for some  tasks too. Would it be a good idea to implement more Kernels (like most of the dot kernels) in my opencl pull request?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: I think not, do you mind doing something not opencl related?
 PhilTillet	I don't mind
 PhilTillet	I'd rather do something C++ related though
 blackburn	yeah sure
 harshit_	blackburn: Where is RealFeatures used in octave implemented in libshogun ?
 harshit_	cant find any thing similar in libshogun
 blackburn	harshit_: it is SimpleFeatures<float64_t>
 harshit_	so if i have to refer SimpleFeatures<int32_t> then what do i need to use ?
 blackburn	IntFeatures
 harshit_	Is there any file where all these conversions are listed ?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	interfaces/modular/Features.i
 blackburn	line 276
 harshit_	okay thanks :)
 harshit_	dam how can you remember line no too !!!
 harshit_	you really are into shogun, must say :)
 blackburn	I took a look
 harshit_	oh
 blackburn	no, I can't remember that stuff too :)
 harshit_	but still you know alot about it :)
 blackburn	I have to heh
 PhilTillet	so, blackburn, any idea? :p
 blackburn	PhilTillet: yeah thinking
 PhilTillet	i couldn't find any size function for EFeatureType
 blackburn	any preference?
 PhilTillet	hmmm
 PhilTillet	not really
 PhilTillet	your question was kind of broad :p
 PhilTillet	I can work on design issues, safety or some algorithm
 PhilTillet	or implement garbage collection everywhere (who said troll? :p)
 blackburn	knn regression?
 PhilTillet	why not, i was more used to knn classification but it's ok I guess
 blackburn	nearest centroid

 harshit_	blackburn: I can not use UIntFeatures, octave gives an error: `UIntFeatures' undefined near line 8 column 13
 harshit_	but IntFeatures works fine
 PhilTillet	blackburn, so let's say nearest centroid?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, I know you can trivially fix this issue http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/202/steps/compile/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	so please do :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: git is currently unavailable for me
 PhilTillet	guess I got to find inspiration on knn :)
 blackburn	public access point and 22 is blocked
@sonney2k	blackburn, what happened?
@sonney2k	blackburn, then tell me what I have to do to fix this!
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	just add KNN_COVERTREE_POINT to ignores
 PhilTillet	haha
 PhilTillet	metaprogramming errors
 PhilTillet	instantiated from ...
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.254.100] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@sonney2k	blackburn, why does this error not occur w/ eg ISOMAP_COVERTREE_POINT
 blackburn	sonney2k: isn't it ignored?
 blackburn	sonney2k: the only difference is DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS :D
@sonney2k	gsomix, why did you mark your patch work in progress?
@sonney2k	blackburn, that cannot be it
 blackburn	ye
 blackburn	s
 gsomix	sonney2k, a habit.
 blackburn	sonney2k: how does swig select classes to include?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh I know - you define the class  in the .cpp file, n4nd0 in .h
 blackburn	yes
 shogun-buildbot	build #201 of nightly_all is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_all/builds/201
 blackburn	I just came over it as well
@sonney2k	gsomix, did you do a test? I mean set the data and get it and it matched?
 blackburn	sonney2k: there are two ways usually - SERIALIZABLE_DUMMY and ignoe
 gsomix	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/3Ni2yX8p and http://pastebin.com/Wiumz3qv
@sonney2k	blackburn, so which one will work ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: any but no need to have covertree point in the interface so just ignore
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok then great work - I don't understand why you mark this WIP then - it will not become any better than that.
@sonney2k	blackburn, can a covertree be serialized?
 blackburn	sonney2k: currently no
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is full of std stuff
 gsomix	sonney2k, I removed the WIP status. :)
@sonney2k	argh then this won't work    SG_ADD((CSGObject**) &m_covertree, "m_covertree", "Member cover tree", MS_NOT_AVAILABLE);
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	too bad
 blackburn	sonney2k: mainly because covertree is not a descendant of CSGObject :D
@sonney2k	not only
@sonney2k	alright we have to bug n4ndo about this
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am not really happy with that covertree
@sonney2k	what's up with JL's covertree?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is hard to integrate there
 blackburn	both I and gsomix tried
 blackburn	and have died with a lot of leaks/bugs while integrating
@sonney2k	why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hard question
 gsomix	not hard. just somewhere I'm doing wrong. I need to be careful.
@sonney2k	hmmhh - I expect JLs code to be fast at least
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	yes it is faster
 blackburn	so we would need to make another attempt
@sonney2k	so it would be really great to get it
@sonney2k	how long have you tried?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I agree
@sonney2k	and serialization should be simpler too
 blackburn	I spent a week or so on that
@sonney2k	because JL hates std:: crap
 blackburn	gsomix have spent a month or two
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	but not as active as me probably
 gsomix	:(
 gsomix	sonney2k, blackburn: I plan to return to work on covertree again.
@sonney2k	blackburn, gsomix has written the octave sparse matrix typemap - that would have taken you a year :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not really understand why we both failed
 blackburn	sonney2k: I heard it was easy ;)
@sonney2k	actually :P
@sonney2k	everything is easy if you know how
 blackburn	in the arpack.cpp
 blackburn	I guess everybody is afraid to enter to that file
 blackburn	sonney2k: I already did some sparse stuff you know
 blackburn	sonney2k: I still do not understand why you hate std :)
 blackburn	shogun/lib/ShogunException.cpp:29 is a funny line
@sonney2k	I saw this even!
 blackburn	sonney2k: really? did you run shogun on some controller?
@sonney2k	no a 92G machine
@sonney2k	you know big data ;D

@sonney2k	(read your code)
 n4nd0	ok :)
 n4nd0	has that turned out to be an issue?
 n4nd0	sorry for the non-required explanation :S
@sonney2k	well it didn't compile and would crash when being serialized
 n4nd0	not good

 n4nd0	sonney2k: I proposed it yesterday to make a test on iris dataset to someone who was looking for a patch
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, great
 blackburn	iris?
 blackburn	hah
 n4nd0	yeah, why?
 blackburn	I am afraid to be wrong but isn't it <1K of vectors?
 n4nd0	150 instances is said on the webpage
 n4nd0	mmm yeah, maybe that is too little
 blackburn	yes it will be even slower may be
 n4nd0	in octave example, super small, it was faster though
 blackburn	slightly overheaded with tree :)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	ok then
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you have your own example to try it on GTSRB? somewhere in shogun?

 blackburn	n4nd0: just load it from numpy and use
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, thank you
 n4nd0	wow, 174MB for one of them
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't remember dimensionality exactly but there are 39K of train vectors
 blackburn	and 12K of test ones
 n4nd0	blackburn: have you ever trained sth with this?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes multiclass svm
 n4nd0	blackburn: how long did it take?
 blackburn	kernel svm takes 3h or so
 blackburn	GMNP essentially
 blackburn	liblinear took a little
 blackburn	5-10 minutes
@sonney2k	So you could do either some  ASSERT()'s replacement with meaningful  SG_ERROR() messages or start some big task - SGVector
 blackburn	gsomix: it is for you
 blackburn	^
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	for SGVector you could either implement refcounting business and/or replace Array.h with SGVector
@sonney2k	the latter would boil down to adding the functions from Array to SGVector and then replace
@sonney2k	same fro Array2 -> SGMatrix, etc
 blackburn	n4nd0: if you want to dig into details: features have been constructed using HOG w/o block normalization and prewitt gradient
 blackburn	some median filtering as well however it is really too detailed then
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn: are the same you use for the paper you showed me?
 blackburn	n4nd0: bingo
 gsomix	sonney2k, do I have the time to think? :)
