 saket	hi
 saket	how do we run examples in the folder examples/documented/libshogun ?
 saket	Compiling them with "  g++ classifier_nearest_centroid.cpp -lshogun "
 saket	give this error classifier_nearest_centroid.cpp:1:36: fatal error: shogun/features/Labels.h: No such file or directory
 saket	do i need to give some parameter to ./configure
 votjakovr	saket: Hi, Have you installed shogun by running 'make install'?
 saket	votjakovr: yes i did
 saket	other examples do compiel
 saket	*compile
 saket	but on running i get error while loading shared libraries: libshogun.so.14: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 saket	I think i need to append path to libshogun.so.14 to some env variable..right? any idea ?
 saket	got it ..needed to add the path to /etc/ld.so.conf
 votjakovr	saket: great :)
 votjakovr	saket: I think you can't compile classifier_nearest_centroid.cpp, because Labels.h in shogun/labels/ now
 saket	oh
 saket	shall i move it ?
 votjakovr	saket: No, I don't think so...
 saket	votjakovr: I will be grateful to you if can help me out with the v_array issue .. i mail yesterday to the mailing list
 saket	votjakovr: subject of the mail = "v_array issue && ball_tree update."

 sijin	@lisitsyn  hello, do you have time now?
@lisitsyn	sijin: yes a bit
 sijin	I have modified takpee_shogun.cpp/tapkee_shogun.hpp for support of KPCA and retriving projecting function, could you please check it? If it is ok, i can move to writing the warper
 sijin	Since projecting_func->implemtation is NULL currently, I can't test the program by myself
@lisitsyn	sijin: I am doing some changes in that code last days
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	that's a blocker for changing kpca to use tapkee
@lisitsyn	I will test things tonight and commit
 sijin	Also, I notice that kpca has get_transformation_matrix(),
@lisitsyn	it is kind of bad naming for me
 sijin	can projecting function provide that? or I would like to delete this member function from that class
@lisitsyn	lets get back to that once I prepare some things
 sijin	ok.
 wiking	rer
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: bah that test fails
@lisitsyn	0.425

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no additional domain in china!
@iglesiasg	wiking: holidays or living there?
@sonney2k	if that was not spam
 wiking	iglesiasg: 1 month living... came for a research visit
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: what is this domain name issue? haha
@iglesiasg	it seems fishy idd
@iglesiasg	wiking: nice - aprendiendo espa?ol? :)
 wiking	iglesiasg: ye
@lisitsyn	wiking: so you are in spain?
@sonney2k	wiking, for 9 years you are hanging around on freenode?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah since the beginning
@lisitsyn	crazy
@iglesiasg	how do you get that info?
 wiking	sonney2k: i've even chated on the phone with the guy who started freenode, who died recently
@sonney2k	wiking, did you create that network or what?
@iglesiasg	haha
 wiking	sonney2k: back in those days you had to chat with him on the phone to get the funky 'domains' for your registered user
@sonney2k	heh
 wiking	i don't know what's the current proceedure.... but we should get /shogun :)

@wiking	lol
@wiking	there's like 6 integration tests error on my machine :)
@wiking	no it's a lot
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking just received an application
@HeikoS	per mail
@wiking	serialization_complex_example.py setting 1/2                 OK
@wiking	Warning: program compiled against libxml 209 using older 207
@wiking	woah
@HeikoS	ah it was cced on the list
@wiking	wtf is this? :D
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	i managed to reproduce the error \o/
@wiking	and even more of it! :D
@HeikoS	man, those indian/chinese CVs are always packed ;)
@HeikoS	Lead Vocal & Cofounder of a Rock Band in Zhejiang University (the Rover)
@HeikoS	? Cover punk and metal bands like Sex Pistols and Judas Priest
@HeikoS	yeah :D

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hehe
@HeikoS	I wasnt born 15 years ago ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  has the guy sent any PR? I haven't seen any but just to be sure
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: haven't seen
@iglesiasg	wiking, HeikoS : btw guys, are you coming to the workshop too?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: workshop?
@iglesiasg	omg
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: ours?
@iglesiasg	yeah :)
@HeikoS	I see :)
@HeikoS	yes of course :)
@iglesiasg	cool
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: so you too I guess!
@wiking	iglesiasg: yes sure
@HeikoS	aweseom, really looking forward to meet all you guys!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: sure :)
@iglesiasg	wiking: nice
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: yeah, it is going to be nice
@wiking	sonney2k: this seems like a stochastic machine for me.... classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.py setting 1/2 passes 50% of the times and 50% of the times fails... ran 10 times now
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: HeikoS: wiking: I am very probably in berlin starting from late evening of 10th, July
@lisitsyn	oops
@lisitsyn	9th
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I will come on the 10th or 11th
@iglesiasg	I think
@HeikoS	no idea yet when I will come, but will book flights soon
@HeikoS	Berlin is always worth a week :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is there a lot of sightseeings?
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: remind me how to say that in german
@lisitsyn	some funny long word
@HeikoS	mostly underground clubs/bars/cool places :D
@lisitsyn	(sightseeing)
@wiking	i think i fly in around 10 or 11
@HeikoS	Sehensw?rdigkeit
@wiking	haven't decided yet
@lisitsyn	wurdig or wurdigskeit?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but also some sightseeing which is nice
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I will spend 5 days there
@lisitsyn	hope it would be enough
@HeikoS	Sehensw?rdigkeit
@lisitsyn	alright
@wiking	ok
@wiking	who knows anything about this script: classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.py
@wiking	?
@wiking	as in the integration test for it
@lisitsyn	wiking: does it fail?
@wiking	w SGVector<float64> 2 ({0.5}{0.5})
@wiking	vs
@wiking	w SGVector<float64> 2 ({0.49}{1.160182291326443e+75})
@HeikoS	wiking: I thought I fixed the seed for that?
@HeikoS	since when does it fail?
@wiking	a is the last one b is the [D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C [C is in a and the first one in [C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C
@HeikoS	maybe its the labelss that I changed?
@HeikoS	wiking: ehm?
@wiking	mmm shit
@wiking	sorry something went wrong
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	b is this one data/testsuite/tests/classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular0.txt
@wiking	i.e. the first one with w SGVector<float64> 2 ({0.5}{0.5})
@wiking	and the other one is generated on my machine
@wiking	and of course since they are not the same
@wiking	the integration test fails
@HeikoS	wiking:  are the seeds fixed?
@wiking	HeikoS: dunno
@wiking	the only thing i know is that i compiled the code
@wiking	from the HEAD
@wiking	develop branch
@HeikoS	check the code pls
@wiking	HeikoS: where what?
@HeikoS	classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.py
@HeikoS	python modular
@HeikoS	wiking: tests work fine here
@wiking	HeikoS: ok what should be there?
@HeikoS	last compiled yesterday
@HeikoS	wiking: fixed seeds for python numpy and shogun
@wiking	random.seed(seed)
@wiking	seed=1
@wiking	if u mean that
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	well it's there
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	no idea then
@wiking	but still it fails
@HeikoS	just pulled and compiling
@wiking	and not only this
@HeikoS	will try agian
@wiking	but a lot other
@HeikoS	I also have some tests locally failing
@HeikoS	since I have not all libs installed
@wiking	ok so here's a list of failing integration tests on osx: http://pastebin.com/sAbq05kN
@HeikoS	wiking:  there must be something wrong
@HeikoS	I recently broke all tests
@HeikoS	but corrected afterwards
@HeikoS	so maybe non uptpdate code?
@wiking	HeikoS: i've tried
@wiking	but no help
@HeikoS	Warning: program compiled against libxml 209 using older 207
@HeikoS	weird
@wiking	git pull && make clean && ./configure && make install
@HeikoS	git pull --rebase upstream develop
@HeikoS	thats what I do
@HeikoS	while being in dev branch
@wiking	f2dae9dbaa0b8fbf34b01c5bb53a3108986e4184
@wiking	this is my last commit in dev branch
@wiking	and that's the last one in github as well
@HeikoS	f2dae9dbaa0b8fbf34b01c5bb53a3108986e4184
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	mine too
@HeikoS	strange!
@HeikoS	but no idea, probably mac stuff
@wiking	i guess so
@HeikoS	wiking: sorry, I have to do some work now, see you!
@wiking	but still then i guess this could be a background for why one integration test fails on travis
@wiking	okok cya
@HeikoS	wiking: yes good point!
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: ping
 vgorbati	isitsyn: yes, I saw the test failure - guess it was that 1e-5 probability. Make the number smaller?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn:or another way - the things are much better, when target_dim==initial. I can make it so..
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes please
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes for the second option?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
@lisitsyn	and we could change the data actually
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: you may try some displaced grid in 2d
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: to predefined? I guess I can generate one matrix randomly, see the minimum intersection rate, save the matrix to file, and the read it during the test. Then there wont be any randomness (is ther such a word)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: heh, well we are of nearly the same native language so I understand your words (about your wondering if there is such a word)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: err not in 2d but 3d
@lisitsyn	x = [0,0.001,....,1]
@lisitsyn	y = [0,0.001,...,1]
@lisitsyn	z = some noise
@lisitsyn	this should preserve neighborhoods much more
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: and project that to 2D?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: i mean embed
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: do you feel the difference btw?
@lisitsyn	it is actually pretty the same but it looks better to say 'project' about PCA
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: in data? there's a linear dependenc
@lisitsyn	and 'embed' for some non-linear thing like LLE
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: anyway please take a look
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes, I did feel that it is wrong to say 'project' for non-linear embedding methods
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, I will take a look after an hour I guess

 deerishi	@HeikoS: hello
@HeikoS	deerishi: hi
 deerishi	i am just gonna give the pull request.
@HeikoS	deerishi: did you put the data generator into tools?
@HeikoS	and import it from both the modular and the graphical ex?
 deerishi	nope.by data generator do you mean the circular data.
 deerishi	?
 deerishi	in tools do i jyst need to write import preprocessor_kernel.py and import preprocessor_kernel_graphical.py?
@HeikoS	deerishi: no
@HeikoS	you import the circle data from the examples
@HeikoS	not the other way round
@HeikoS	and please rename the files to preprocessor_kpca ...
@HeikoS	kernel doesnt mean much :)
 deerishi	m still a bit unsure abt what i need to do in the tools folder . i have done  shogun / examples / undocumented / python_modular ---->The KPCA CODE: preprocessor_kpca.py shogun / examples / undocumented / python_modular / graphical ----->The circular input data: preprocessor_kpca_graphical.py
@HeikoS	you generate your data with some function in a file right?
@HeikoS	that has to go to the tools folder
@HeikoS	then, both examples import this file to generate data
@HeikoS	one example plots, the other one doesnt
@HeikoS	makes three files
@HeikoS	1) circle_data.py - located in python_modular/tools
@HeikoS	2) modular example - located in python_modular, imports 1
@HeikoS	3) graphicla example - located in python_modular/graphical, imports 1, plots
 deerishi	k.i think i got it.it was a slight misunderstanding on my part. the data generation file goes to the tools folder..
 deerishi	thanks @HeikoS
 deerishi	:)
@HeikoS	welcome :)

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: sure, but debugging using cout<< is soo painful)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: well you may try gdb or anything like that :)
 Yanglittle	in the grid search, assuming the gaussian kernel, there are two parameters, delta and C. this is no problem. But in mkl_multiclass, assuming five gaussian kernels, and it needs to find five different delta and a C, does grid_serach can support this?
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^ could you please comment that?
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: in MKL you usually do not optimize over kernel parameters but just put in a set of kernels and then look at the weights
@HeikoS	MKL solves for the weights for you
@HeikoS	then you only do a gridsearch over C
@HeikoS	5 different kernel parameters also is completely infeasible
@HeikoS	params_per_kernel^5 * C_possiilities
@lisitsyn	actually it sounds exp yeah
 Yanglittle	yes i know this but when calculate the single kernel, we search a good pair of delta and C, but the good delta may not be the best for the mkl_multiclass. what do you think?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: i am having troubles on how to use gdb. Ok, I added -g option in makefile, so that now 'shogun-unit-test' executable contains debug info. Ok, I can run 'gdb shogun-unit-test'. But then, how do I break the execution in needed test?
 Yanglittle	gdb.set_trace()?
 vgorbati	I know about pdb.set_trace() in python, but does it exist in C/C++?

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes)
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: what is delta for you?
@HeikoS	the kernel width?
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: sorry I did not get that, could you explain again?
 Yanglittle	yeah, the width, the kernel parameter.

@HeikoS	Yanglittle: could you explain your question again?
@HeikoS	why do you want to select the bandwidths of all kernels in MKL?

@iglesiasg	aham I see it is for one interface
 Yanglittle	i want to make each subkernel get a good accuracy on the data. and so , is it beneficial for mkl? in mkl, each subkernel needs the width, and how to determine the width?
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: you don't select the width but rather throw some kernels at the MKL which then discards the unimportant ones via the weights.
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: also if one single kernel is best for your problem, then all MKL kernels will have the same width

@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: is it possible that embedding shuffles columns a bit? Then the picture will look right, but neighbor indices not
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: columns like vectors?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes, feature vectors
@lisitsyn	no, the order is preserved
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: yes, thats the idea :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: are you reading that iranian madness in the mentors list?
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I can understand the discussion though
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am quite opposite to that - citizens are responsible for their country
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: still the reaction is understandable - it counters the open-source principle
@HeikoS	while google has a point
@HeikoS	and they cannot do anything anyway
@HeikoS	so ....
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you think it does counter that?
@lisitsyn	I mean open-source is not about gsoc
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	nobody can ever deny open-source
@HeikoS	but gsoc is about open-source
@HeikoS	anyway, doesnt matter
@HeikoS	google cannot chang eit
@lisitsyn	it is about funding which comes from google
@lisitsyn	if google decided not to fund something it is just their choice
@HeikoS	its not even their choice in this case
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we actually have one iranian phd student arya
@HeikoS	where?
@lisitsyn	which has been around
@HeikoS	ah yes I remember
@lisitsyn	well he posts some things to the mailing list sometimes
@lisitsyn	and we can't take him as gsoc student

 Yanglittle	in the grid_search, how can i get the array of the build_values? It seems no the method.
@HeikoS	Yanglittle: no there is no method, you can print the parameter tree though
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so I checked really carefully, and it looks like the test is also ok. The thing is, that for every point there are sometimes a lot of points nearly at the same distance to it - and when we embed them, this distances change slightly, that can't be seen visually, but actually changes nearest neighbors

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: the bad news is that it is still unclear what to do with the test)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: what about giving the data that does not have such problem (I mean a lot of points at nearly the same distance)?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so that small changes in distance between points, caused by embedding, should not influence the nearest neighbors?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: if you have such data :)

@HeikoS	It would be nice if you created  examples for the methods that you unit-tested
@HeikoS	graphical would be even better :)
@HeikoS	but you can also continue on other things
@HeikoS	as you seem to have a good clue of what to do
 votjakovr	HeikoS: On Octave?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: python would be best
@HeikoS	and then once these work translate to octave
@HeikoS	votjakovr: in the style of the existing regression_gaussian_process_modular.py
