@besser82	drwiking, here comes the fc24 chroot =)  -->  https://besser82.fedorapeople.org/chroots/fedora-24-x86_64.tar.xz
@besser82	give it another 30 secs. to fully upload  ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: hey any news on the plugins you mentioned?
@besser82	drwiking, ready to leech
@HeikoS	besser82: also wanted to ask whether you are interested in looking into the matlab and swig issue
@HeikoS	besser82: would be soooo cool to have matlab swig
@HeikoS	and I think this is possible
@HeikoS	in standard way
@besser82	HeikoS, currently writing the dynamic-loader lib, when that is done, I need to write a libshogun which just declares the empty class-factories and such...
@besser82	HeikoS, the only problem we have here is:  I don't have matlab to test all the stuff  :(
@HeikoS	ah great
@HeikoS	besser82: yes thats always the issue with matlab
@HeikoS	but cool about the other thing
@HeikoS	way more important anyways
@besser82	jepp, since swig needs to be redone aftwards to...
@besser82	in fact pluginizing shogun is a long road, since we need to poke all it's guts and reconnect them in a different way
@besser82	buafter that is finished, we can do crazy, fancy stuff like rolling-releases and add new feature / functions on the fly
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah definitely
@HeikoS	besser82: hey btw any opinion on this:
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3010
@besser82	HeikoS, just commented on the diff

@besser82	lisitsyn, ping?
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey
@besser82	lisitsyn, yo!
@besser82	lisitsyn, I'm pretty done with the plugin-loading lib
 lisitsyn	hmm itneresting
 lisitsyn	:)
@besser82	So we can start poking out shogun's guts next week
 lisitsyn	show me
@besser82	lisitsyn, not yet in public repo  :P
@besser82	lisitsyn, will push during the eve
@besser82	the first testing / alpha thing... like dynaplugz-0.0.0.1
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	okie
@besser82	lisitsyn, So how do we want to handle the pluginizing?
 lisitsyn	well select some base classes
@besser82	yeah!  :P
@besser82	like the base classes every type of plugin derives from CSVM, etc
@besser82	thats for sure
@besser82	but how to handle it github wise?
 lisitsyn	I guess branch
 lisitsyn	what are alternatives?
@besser82	My proposal is:  Keep every plugin / lib / etc. in an own repo...
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	why
@besser82	so we can go away from that fat monolithic build and over-laborated cmake-code
@besser82	keep things isolated and simple
 lisitsyn	I think separate dirs would suffice
 lisitsyn	they have shared library anyway
@besser82	then we still have that monolithic structure
@besser82	like needing to build the whole thing if just one single thing changes in one plugin
 lisitsyn	why?
@besser82	and we cannot do stuff like fast rolling releases
 lisitsyn	we could have some library/
 lisitsyn	which is built once
 lisitsyn	and modules/
@besser82	because of in distros i cannot just build a single rpm in a set of many
 lisitsyn	each of them is selected and then built (and rebuilt on updates)
@besser82	that starts to make things over-elaborated angain
@besser82	we currently have so many different corner-cases in cmake and everything
@besser82	and sub-projects won't help that much
@besser82	that's why I'm proposing keep every single thing in an isolated repo, and e.g. have some maintainance tool to build a full set
 lisitsyn	I don't really get why splitting repos would help
 lisitsyn	it is just about git layout
 lisitsyn	I mean it is okay to have custom plugins anywhere else
@besser82	because then we have the possiblity to easily release a shogun-plugin-fancy_shit 1.2.3.4
@besser82	and can do fast builds on e.g. Travis
 lisitsyn	we can do that with travis anyway just building this very thing from one repo
@besser82	yeah, but with too much effort just to detect, what changed...
 lisitsyn	you mean if we change the library
 lisitsyn	ah ok I get it
 lisitsyn	but still I am not sure we would be able to handle this submodules madness
 lisitsyn	it would work well if we had rock-stable library
 lisitsyn	but currently we still want to develop it

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: prepare cmake for ruby
@besser82	lisitsyn, sry... been afk
@besser82	That can be handled pretty well
@besser82	Look at the guys from SUSE
@besser82	They constantly develop on that pretty large YaST-thing
@besser82	and keep all the stuff in seperate repos...  no need for submodules  ;)
@besser82	will be back in short...  Lunch-time  =)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added ruby to meta examples, cookbook, and test build
@HeikoS	drwiking, lisitsyn, besser82 check this I need help: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3014
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: this is indeed dangerous to make it via custom command
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I know
@HeikoS	thats why I ask
@HeikoS	java meta examples are compiled this way
@HeikoS	(and java undocumented ones too)
 lisitsyn	yeah but there is only one java
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well I am happy to change
@HeikoS	point was to get something working
@HeikoS	and then go from there
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and it indeed works
 lisitsyn	okok
@HeikoS	automagic cpp examples :)
@HeikoS	that pass the test build
 lisitsyn	we have meta cpp?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	well
@HeikoS	hacky draft
@HeikoS	needs some love
 lisitsyn	okie
@HeikoS	if you pull my PR feature branch you can run it locally
@HeikoS	also adds it to the cookbook
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think you need add_executable
 lisitsyn	instead of custom command
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: not possible
 lisitsyn	why?
@HeikoS	the .cpp does not exist at cmake time
@HeikoS	it is generated
@HeikoS	I gotta run
@HeikoS	can you comment on the github page?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah ok
 lisitsyn	I don't know how to do that then haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: see what I wrote, maybe that can work
@HeikoS	see you later
