 n4nd0	blackburn: good morning!
 n4nd0	blackburn: how is it going?
 blackburn	n4nd0: guten tag ;)
 blackburn	fine, and you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: fine too :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have a couple of questions
 blackburn	shoot
 n4nd0	blackburn: yesterday I was checking if the QDA stuff I have done so far had some memory leaks
 blackburn	yeah painful shit
 n4nd0	so I used valgrind and target an example done with python modular
 blackburn	right
 n4nd0	and the thing is that I got stuff as "still reachable" or "possibly lost"
 n4nd0	I was a bit concerned about that
 n4nd0	but actually it also appeared when I run the example with the lines where QDA is used commented out
 blackburn	n4nd0: valgrind always reports some errors on python itself
 blackburn	use valgrind --leak-check=full --log-file=somelog python yourexample
 blackburn	and then just find 'shogun' in your log file :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok cool
 n4nd0	I used a suppressions file for the python stuff
 blackburn	there is a way to ignore python things with valgrind
 n4nd0	but I get it doesn't remove everything
 blackburn	yeah, you'd have to recompile python for that IIRC
 n4nd0	I read something about that
 n4nd0	does it pay off? I mean is it sth good to do?
 blackburn	C++ example would be simplier to check for leaks etc
 blackburn	hmm I did not it
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	and another thing
 n4nd0	I am having a hard time trying to find the svd :S
 n4nd0	I am using this wrap_dgesvd function
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	what's the problem?
 n4nd0	so when I run it with valgrind it looks to work fine
 n4nd0	but without it fails on an assert
 n4nd0	python: malloc.c:4631: _int_malloc: Assertion `(unsigned long)(size) >= (unsigned long)(nb)' failed.
 blackburn	hmm
 n4nd0	but I think this one is related to the parameters work and lwork that I thought I shouldn't worry about when using the wrap function
 n4nd0	they are in dgesvd but the wrap seems to take care of them
 blackburn	try to insert SG_SPRINT("lworka=%d",lworka); at lapack.cpp:260
 blackburn	and check whether it is positive
 n4nd0	in any case I found it really weird that it runs with valgrind but not without it
 blackburn	no, not really weird, it is sometimes
 n4nd0	really, why so? any clue?
 blackburn	some sandbox or so
 blackburn	valgrind takes more care :)
 n4nd0	what is this thing about that sometimes sg_print doesn't work but sg_sprint does?
 n4nd0	(this looks like a tv show, many questions :P)
 blackburn	n4nd0: sg_print uses m_sgio field of class derived from SGObject
 n4nd0	blackburn: lworka is positive, >>>>>>> lworka=14
 blackburn	and sg_sprint uses global SGIO
 blackburn	hm..
 blackburn	when something could be wrong with your params
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am checking changing the ones that were not example the same as they are used in pinv, let's see
 n4nd0	blackburn: it seems there was a problem using 'N' in jobu
 n4nd0	blackburn: it worked after changing it to 'A'
 n4nd0	the thing is that I am not interested in U in the svd decomposition A = U * S * V^T so I just wanted to ignore it
 n4nd0	I thought 'N' was for that
 blackburn	n4nd0: is it a QDA?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes, I am doing this for QDA
 blackburn	what is the matrix you decompose?
 n4nd0	but I said nothing before ... it does still fail
 blackburn	feature?
 n4nd0	features of one class - mean of the features of that class
 n4nd0	and that thing is to be done for every class
 n4nd0	scikit-learn's code
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	n4nd0: I just mean you could compute gram matrices instead of it
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ufgp6
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have no idea what is that :S
 blackburn	gram matrix?
 blackburn	XX'
 blackburn	err
 blackburn	X'X
 blackburn	eigvectors(X'X) = V, where UEVT = svd(X)
 n4nd0	and you mean to get the eigenvalues of that?
 blackburn	UEV' I mean
 n4nd0	ok I see
 blackburn	I don't know if it is better
 blackburn	dinner time
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	the matrix will be bigger I think
 blackburn	brb
 n4nd0	dinner?
 n4nd0	what time is it in Russian man? :P
 blackburn	14.18
 n4nd0	early dinner then
 blackburn	probably :)
 blackburn	lunch is a better word may be? ;)
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok did you trace the error?
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha oh lunch! that's better now yes
 n4nd0	I think I had some trouble with the dimensions :S
 n4nd0	my bad

 harshit_	hello everyone
 vikram360	hello harshit_
 harshit_	so there are some ppl out there i thought i hav entered some ghostcity !
 harshit_	btw i was planning to implement C5.0 in shogun
 harshit_	need some starting advise
 vikram360	harshit_ : haha, I was planning on doing the same thing for my gsoc proposal
 harshit_	that seems to be the most easiest one
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@109.226.78.202] has left #shogun []
 vikram360	harshit_ : not really, I chose it because I've worked with DTrees before.
 harshit_	thats exactly what i am saying decision trees are easiest to implement at least for me
