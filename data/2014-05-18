@iglesiasg	parijat, Good morning!
 parijat	iglesiasg: I saw your comments. I will update them together with other comments that you may have
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am going to continue reviewing now
 parijat	parijat: great! I am going to be available in irc if you need to clarify something

 shogun-buildbot	build #805 of nightly_default is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/805
@iglesiasg	parijat, in the prune tree routine
@iglesiasg	parijat, when data.attribute_id is -1, why can we be sure that there will be always two children?
 parijat	iglesiasg: data.attribute_id is not -1
@iglesiasg	parijat, ah sorry. Yeah, when it is not -1 but the attribute is not nomial
@iglesiasg	nominal*
-!- parijat_ [75dc29d5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.220.41.213] has joined #shogun
 parijat_	iglesiasg: connection problem! I was saying that the if else is for whether the attribute is nominal or not
@iglesiasg	parijat_, yep
 parijat_	iglesiasg: the not equality to -1 is to ensure array can be indexed
-!- parijat [75c7dcfd@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.199.220.253] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
-!- parijat_ is now known as parijat
@iglesiasg	parijat_, yeah, but if attribute_id can actually be -1, I think the check should be before than indexing the array
@iglesiasg	parijat, see what I mean?
 parijat	iglesiasg: yes I could create a larger if encompassing this entire block, but this works just as fine I checked. So I left it this way
@iglesiasg	parijat, hmm
@iglesiasg	parijat, I meant this
@iglesiasg	instead of
@iglesiasg	if (m_nominal[current->data.attribute_id] && (current->data.attribute_id!=-1))
@iglesiasg	doing
@iglesiasg	if ((current->data.attribute_id!=-1) && m_nominal[current->data.attribute_id])
@iglesiasg	because if current->data.attribute_id == -1 the m_nominal[current->data.attribute_id] is going to break
@iglesiasg	in any case, you know better when data.attribute_id will be -1
@iglesiasg	it just looks weird to me doing
@iglesiasg	if (array[i] && i >= 0)
 parijat	iglesiasg: okay ya! I can change that..
@iglesiasg	parijat, explain me anyway when can it be that data.attribute_id is -1, I sort of recall checking that when you pushed id3
 parijat	iglesiasg:  but I think C++ compiler does something intelligent here.. because that thing is -1 everytime we reach a leaf node and I didnt get any runtime errors yet
 parijat	iglesiasg: its -1 for leaf nodes. -1 is the default value and in leaf nodes we need not set it to any other value because we need not choose any more attribute to classify data further
@iglesiasg	parijat, all right
 parijat	iglesiasg: so basically data.attribute_id is -1 is a check for leaf nodes
@iglesiasg	parijat, got it
 parijat	iglesiasg: :-)
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am debugging in my head the program when attribute_id is -1 :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, so, if I understand it correctly,  when prune_tree_machine is called with current being a leaf node, predicted_unpruned and predicted_pruned are the same. Is that right?
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya you are right.
 parijat	iglesiasg: there is nothing to prune in a leaf node
@iglesiasg	parijat, which means that prune_tree_machine is not going to do anything for leaf nodes
@iglesiasg	parijat, exactly
@iglesiasg	parijat, what about doing like this at the very top of prune_tree_machine
@iglesiasg	/ if current node is a leaf node, pruning the current node makes no difference in the tree
@iglesiasg	if (current->data.attribute.id == -1)
@iglesiasg	return
@iglesiasg	or something like that (the comment doesn't need to be the same :P)
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya thats a better way to do it.
@iglesiasg	parijat, cool, then we can get rid of the check in the if
 parijat	iglesiasg: plus unnecessary code execution
@iglesiasg	indeed
@iglesiasg	parijat, now, tell me about the second branch of the if. For non-nominal nodes, there will always be two children, right?
 parijat	iglesiasg: yes always..
 parijat	iglesiasg: we split across a single threshold remember?
@iglesiasg	parijat, ah yeah, true
@iglesiasg	let's just put a sanity check with a require
@iglesiasg	in case someone ever updates that with several thresholds or whatever, the code in prune doesn't break or behaves unexpectedly
 parijat	iglesiasg: alright sure!
 parijat	iglesiasg: could you please put 2-3 word comments for these things that we discussed in the PR. It would help me remember while I make the update
@iglesiasg	parijat, already done
 parijat	iglesiasg: thanks!
 parijat	brb in a miin
 parijat	i'm back
@iglesiasg	parijat, maybe we can discuss a moment about the comment I just wrote on line 484
@iglesiasg	brb
 parijat	iglesiasg: threshold cant be larger than or less than all elements, but the validation data chosen can be such that all data points from current node move to only left child or only right child. In that case the mentioned special cases can happen
 parijat	iglesiasg: to back up.. this case arises in the unittest which I designed
@iglesiasg	parijat, all right! Can you make a comment with that?
@iglesiasg	parijat, I think it is more clear then
 parijat	iglesiasg: sure!
@iglesiasg	parijat, also, for the next time please keep separate pull requests
@iglesiasg	parijat, one for the pruning, another one for handling missing values, etc
@iglesiasg	parijat, the review process is much faster then..
@iglesiasg	parijat, do you know you can issue several pull requests at the same time?Just use different branches
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok. actually I added handling missing values first... then later I added the pruning thing
@iglesiasg	parijat, a new one for the pruning would have done it then ;)
@iglesiasg	as long as it is not dependent on the previous one, you could have done a couple of separate PRs
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok. atleast in this case, these are not related. so I could have actually sent in separate PRs

 parijat	iglesiasg: about NOT_A_NUMBER.. I tried using it at first, but is there a way to check equality for it?
@iglesiasg	parijat, I see in CMath that there is fequals that calls CMath::is_nan
@iglesiasg	parijat, did you try that?
 parijat	iglesiasg: nope.. I was just foolishly using simple == stuff
 parijat	iglesiasg: I will change back to NOT_A_NUMBER and try fequals.
@iglesiasg	parijat, great

 kislay	hey pickle27
 pickle27	hey dude
 pickle27	kislay: its coming along
 pickle27	couple of things
 pickle27	I think we probably want the interface to use class methods that take the cv mat as an arg
 pickle27	rather than creating the obj with the constructor and calling getMatrix
 pickle27	we'll then make the constructor private so you can't make an instance of the factory
 pickle27	also
 pickle27	I'd rather that it was one factory class and you pass a flag to indicate which conversion method to use
 pickle27	then we'll benchmark from there and leave only the fastest implementation
 pickle27	I think you'll find it easier to write the benchmark with that design / architecture
 kislay	okay. yeah that will be better too.
 kislay	so instead of applying the cv Mat through constructor, We need to use it class method
 pickle27	yeah!
 pickle27	then when you use it it will look something like
 pickle27	SGMatrix = SGMatrixFactory::GetMatrix(cv::Mat)
 pickle27	you can probably pick better names
 kislay	yeah. :)
 kislay	hmm.. I am getting what you said.
 kislay	so, the way we use it should be in a single line .
 kislay	here It takes 3 lines to get the work done
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.222.9.66] has quit [Quit:  I love my HydraIRC -> http://www.hydrairc.com <-]
 pickle27	exactly
 pickle27	it'll feel more like a function than a class really
 kislay	yeah
 pickle27	but having it as a class lets us hide more stuff if we need to
 kislay	yup. Thats right. I will update the gist.
 kislay	And yeah, I have  been updating the doc. Will add more to it. Just see it. Ithink I added few things there.
 pickle27	sounds good!

 thoralf	Hey Abinash
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Hi !
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Is there any implementation of evaluation metrics for multi-label classification in shogun
 thoralf	abinash_panda: No, I don't think so.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: So, for comparing the accuracy, I would be implementing CMultilabelAccuracy in week 2.
 abinash_panda	I am thinking of implementing an example-based metric as specified in http://cse.seu.edu.cn/people/zhangml/files/TKDE'13LV.pdf
 abinash_panda	any suggestions
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Yeah, just something like accuracy.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Don't spend too much time on this.  If we're good in time, we can do something more general.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Ok. So, I would be implementing it also in the week 2.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Alright.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah. I think it can be implemented very easily, so I would not be spending too much time on this one.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Exact.  Especially when we're doing the example based metrics.
 thoralf	We can simply add/average numbers.
 thoralf	Label-based may be annoying, because shogun works more-less example-based.
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 thoralf	Maybe the connection will abort soon.
* thoralf is on the train.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I have updated the GSoC schedule. If you could have a look and suggest any changes to be made.
 abinash_panda	The link is https://docs.google.com/a/itbhu.ac.in/document/d/1PnlKr_VRDS6QOxquZILP5BpPH9FgCtekxOKSz6Rq0l0/edit
 thoralf	Okay.
 thoralf	2 minutes.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Please check ./examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_multilabeloutputliblinear_modular.py
 thoralf	Okay, weeks 1-2 are ambitious.  I think the schedule is too optimistic, but in week 3 we have some buffer to compensate.
 thoralf	In week 4 you're planning to reuse Hashed*Features.  First of all, I thing we shouldn't use DENSE features at all.  Only concentrate on sparse features.
 thoralf	Second, I think we cannot really re-use HashedSparseFeatures, because it's missing an option to use different seeds for hashing.
 thoralf	Again, I think week 4 is too optimistic, but weeks 5-6 are easier.  So I guess you will need to carry some work from week 4 to the following weeks.  Are you aware of that?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Ok.
 abinash_panda	Any suggestions on modification
 thoralf	I think in week 7 we should directly head for CLR and skip the pairwise comparison.
 thoralf	The schedule is already very tight.
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 thoralf	For week 7 you can schedule a ipython notebook to present what you did until the mid-term-evaluation.
 thoralf	And preparing the CLR stuff.
 thoralf	For CLR you'll need another decoding (argmax method).  Everything else should stay the same (if we did it right).

 thoralf	[23:04] <thoralf> For week 7 you can schedule a ipython notebook to present what you did until the mid-term-evaluation.
 thoralf	[23:04] <thoralf> And preparing the CLR stuff.
 thoralf	[23:05] <thoralf> For CLR you'll need another decoding (argmax method).  Everything else should stay the same (if we did it right).
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah. I got it.
 thoralf	Btw., hierachical prediction isn't much more complicated than CLR.
 thoralf	So we could do this as well.
 thoralf	Decoding will be a bit more fun, because it enables some neat optimizations.
 thoralf	But the rest is straight-forward.
 abinash_panda	Ok. So I can move the implemenation of CLR to week 7 and implementation of hierarchical predictions to week 8. Is it too optimistic
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Maybe you can answer the question on your own: How familiar are you with C++?  How much time can you spend (and how much additional effort if you run out of time)?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: It's basically up to you.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: But we can try... and I'm happy to guide you. ;)
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I would like to give it a try then :)
 thoralf	Alright. :D
 thoralf	The schedule looks good so far.  But I think there's some risk breaking deadlines, because if so many new things.
 abinash_panda	Ok. I am ready to put additional effort if I ran out of time ;)
 thoralf	It's not problem if you run out of time, but please report every few days about your progress so I can create a emergency plan.
 thoralf	(just in case I/you see problems)
 abinash_panda	Yeah, sure
 thoralf	What about the power outage in your city?  Everything back to normal?
 abinash_panda	Yeah. Now everything is back to normal.
 abinash_panda	So, I have a very silly doubt (sorry for asking dumb questions). As GSoC starts from tomorrow, I would be committing the codes to my repository. So, should I send the PR after everything is implemented or something else?
 thoralf	I don't remember the last power outage here... so may I ask how often this happens in India?
 abinash_panda	In India, it varies from city to city. During summers, in most part of northern India, there is regular power outage.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Okay, the thing is that we're trying to submit only "complete" features.  If a feature takes more than a few days, try to split it to smaller packages and PR them one by one.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: For example, if you plan to implement different MultilabelModels, then PR them separately.
 thoralf	abinash_panda: MultilabelEvaluation would be a separate PR as well.
 abinash_panda	Ok. I got it
 thoralf	abinash_panda: An example using the Multilabel classes could be a PR.
 thoralf	Rule of thumb: If the code is broken or incomplete, we won't merge it.  But, if you like to, we can do a feature branch.
 thoralf	(Or you do a feature branch in your repo an PR as soon you achieved the next working version)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: Did you check examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_multilabeloutputliblinear_modular.py ?
 thoralf	abinash_panda: It's similar to what we do.  Just as an inspiration.
 abinash_panda	Yeah. I checked the example.
 abinash_panda	I am currently going through the implementation of apply_multilabel_output() method.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: It's getting late in night over here. Got to go. I would start working from tomorrow :)
 thoralf	Oh, funny.  MulticlassMachine supports both multiclass and multilabel
 thoralf	(Well, multilabel is only multiple-outputs-multi-class, but still - it supports both.)
 thoralf	Okay, sleep well.  So tomorrow you're starting your own MultilabelModel?
 abinash_panda	Yeah. I would start implementing MultilabelModel :)
 thoralf	I should be on IRC whole day tomorrow, just in case. ;)
 thoralf	I'm already very excited about this project.
 thoralf	Because it's starting something that has been missing in shogun since years. :D
 thoralf	On one hand, there's some easy tasks and easy wins.
 thoralf	On the other hand, we'll see how to integrate this "new" approach into the whole system.
 thoralf	And probably a few difficulties.
 thoralf	But for me it looks possible.
 abinash_panda	I'm also very excited to work on this project. I would ping you in case of any doubts or difficulties ;)
 thoralf	Good luck and sleep well. ;)
 abinash_panda	Good night :)
