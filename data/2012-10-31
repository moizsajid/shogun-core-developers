@sonney2k	wiking, what's that?
@sonney2k	wiking, where is you gcc faq?
 wiking	nowhere yet
 wiking	i'm still looking into how to redesign the faq page
 wiking	ah ok so we dont have sitemap
 wiking	i'll generate one then
 wiking	http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=156184
@sonney2k	wiking, we might be able to do that automagically based on django urls
@sonney2k	wiking, it is a bit of work but possible https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sitemaps/
@sonney2k	ahh what is badly missing from our website is the feature matrix
@sonney2k	this one here http://shogun-toolbox.org/jmlr10/
@sonney2k	it is created based on some google spredsheet

 blackburn	IT WORKS
 blackburn	YEAH MOTHERFUCKER
 blackburn	wiking: 1.63s to solve 15k x 15k eigenproblem
 blackburn	that means when I get covertree for nearest neighbor queries I can get to quasilinear embedding cost like 5s for enormous number of vectors
 blackburn	stability issues though :D

 ptizoom	sonney*: shall /perl directory (from shogun root) be used for building and exporting a perl-shogun package (to CPAN)?
 blackburn	sonne|work: let me cite you a VW code line
 blackburn	for (vector<string>::iterator i = all.pairs.begin(); i != all.pairs.end();i++)      {
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	ptizoom: shogun/src or?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I want to set VW up to date
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you think I should discuss with john?
 sonne|work	he would probably be happy about that
 sonne|work	but he is NY
 blackburn	sonne|work: well hurricane will end someday
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	not yet awake I mean
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	well I use email usually
 blackburn	so you say he would be happy?
 wiking	aaa
 blackburn	I am not really in what you have done with shashwat
 blackburn	it'd be really cool if we just depend on vw
 sonne|work	longer project then
 blackburn	sonne|work: is there any reason to really include the codE?
 blackburn	may be I could help them to create an API I don't know
 blackburn	sonne|work: they have they own development line - so hard to track it
 blackburn	liblinear is not being really developed anymore, vw is
 sonne|work	no feel free
 sonne|work	but lot of work
 blackburn	sonne|work: okay
 blackburn	will write a mail later
 blackburn	john's APIs are pretty cumbersome for me though
 blackburn	I remembed all these struggles with the covertree
 blackburn	I never managed to get it working, only fernando did :D
 sonne|work	well then maybe better choose some other fun project :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: well I got interested
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw I kinda developed a new method for eigendecomposition
 blackburn	sonne|work: you've seen that probably in last night log
 blackburn	it was working already but it took 3 days to realize that kernel distance is k(x,x) + k(y,y) - 2 k(x,y)
 blackburn	and not k(x,y)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	so we will get some fun stuff soon
 blackburn	both in standalone and shogun versions
 blackburn	sonne|work: can you stand 3 headers with high std and eigen usage?
 blackburn	flexibility was one of my intentions so I have to live with it
 blackburn	eigen bloats code a little btw
 blackburn	but it is like you have intel MKL with no intel MKL

 ptizoom	sonney*: from root...together with data,doc,examples,src, application... then perl! unless you find a good place to stuff a Makefile.PL and a t directory?
 sonne|work	blackburn: can't you avoid using eigen/std in headers?
 sonne|work	ptizoom: well I guess at some point we should just move the src/Makefile and configure and everything one layer up but for now
 sonne|work	in src
 ptizoom	sonne*: okey dookey, I build a /src/perl ; typically I guess one put directories like src, perl, python, swig, debian etc... in the root.
 n4nd0	can someone tell me why #include <eigen3/Eigen/...> doesn't work?
 n4nd0	I have /usr/local/include/eigen3
 n4nd0	and also /usr/include/eigen3 although I don't really know why both of them...
 n4nd0	I made a symbolic link of /usr/local/include/eigen3/Eigen in /usr/local/include and then I got to compile with the directive #include <Eigen/...>
 n4nd0	but still, I do not get why #include <eigen3/Eigen/...> fails
 sonne|work	n4nd0: maybe eigen3 is including sth with <Eigen/xxx> too?
 sonne|work	ptizoom: if it doesn't make sense we will change it later
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what do you mean?
 n4nd0	eigen3 is directory in /usr/local/include that includes another directory called Eigen
 sonne|work	yeah but /usr/local/include/eigen3 is not in the include path
 sonne|work	so when you include <eigen3/Eigen/sth>
 sonne|work	and sth includes <Eigen/whateve> it cannot find whatever

 wiking	n4nd0
 wiking	ah shit
 wiking	but yeah he is doing it wrong
 wiking	he should include -issytem /user/local/include/eigen3
 wiking	and then #include <Eigen...

 blackburn_	sonne|work: I can hide them to cpp adapter
 blackburn_	sonne|work: but there are templates
 blackburn_	not specialized so can't put realization anywhere
 blackburn_	sonne|work: that's all negotiable though but I still like functors more than crazy function pointers
 blackburn_	so not really sure I can avoid templating
 blackburn_	sonne|work: what I am sure is that all libraries should use reverse interface
-!- fmailhot [~fmailhot@c-24-10-116-3.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
 fmailhot	Hi all...what's the appropriate Python interface for multiclass logistic regression trained via SGD? (assuming Shogun has this)  I'd like to do some Shogun/scikit-learn comparisons...
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I have bad news - your assumption is a little wrong :)
 blackburn_	fmailhot:but  modular is the only interface one should use
 fmailhot	OK...python_modular++...got it.
 fmailhot	And...multiclass SGD-trained LR?
 blackburn_	fmailhot: you need exactly that method?
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I can suggest you to try MulticlassLibLinear
 blackburn_	L2 regularized SVM Crammer-Singer that is
 blackburn_	swap(SVM,Crammer-Singer)
 fmailhot	I'm hoping for something that can be trained online, in a streaming data kind of scenario...
 blackburn_	fmailhot: LaRank
 fmailhot	Oh sorry, and most to the point, I'd like well-calibrated probabilities as outputs (hence my initial request for LR)
 blackburn_	fmailhot: ah I see
 blackburn_	fmailhot: if you can still live with batch mode I have one more suggestion
* fmailhot is all ears
 blackburn_	a minute
 blackburn_	forgot the name of class I wrote :D
 blackburn_	fmailhot: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/multiclass/MulticlassTreeGuidedLogisticRegression.h
 blackburn_	fmailhot: it is tree group lasso multiclass logistic regression
 blackburn_	yeah it is funny we have such complex algorithms and have no SGD
 blackburn_	:D
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I think I can implement basic multiclass logistic regression in next 2-3 days if it is required
 fmailhot	Cool, thanks. I'll have a look at that. And if you want to implement multiclass LR, I'd certainly be happy about it!  :D  (obviously I understand that you & other contributors are busy, though)
 blackburn_	fmailhot: well I can find time if I know what to do - usually I am a little lost
 blackburn_	fmailhot: IIRC basic regression is just two lines patch for that tree one
 fmailhot	OK, cool...I'll do some experimenting with that and come back w/ questions as they arise. Thanks again!
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I just checked - yes I'd have to change regularizer
 blackburn_	fmailhot: but as it would be highly experimental I give no warranty :D
 fmailhot	:)  Fair enough
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I'll try, test it a little, commit and let you know once I get home
 blackburn_	so 2-3 hours
 fmailhot	No need to knock yourself out...it's only 10:30AM here in California.
 fmailhot	And tomorrow is fine, too.
 fmailhot	Thanks very much for this!
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I will forget in other case :D
 blackburn_	fmailhot: 21:31 here heh
 fmailhot	Ah...heh. OK then.
 blackburn_	fmailhot: I am from that snowy dark country
 blackburn_	fmailhot: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/lib/slep/slep_mc_tree_lr.cpp solver is pretty compact
 fmailhot	Cool, thanks.

* fmailhot thinks he's stepped into a surrealist IRC performance art piece...
 ptizoom	I see shogun is going well...I try to learn it also bit by bit... there are lots of things in it, incredible.
 blackburn1	just a few algorithms
 ptizoom	u r 2 modest
 ptizoom	actually I wish there was already a group like this in the nooties... it would have simplified research no end...
 ptizoom	whish
 blackburn1	not really sure what you mean
 blackburn1	I failed turing test you know
 ptizoom	well, those ML are wonderful to organise trial and errors...and find converging algo...n'est ce pas?
 ptizoom	and with a package like this, it gives no excuses, not to try...
 blackburn1	well I see ML quite stupid actually :D
 ptizoom	that the beauty!
 ptizoom	stupid and beautiful
 ptizoom	how many ll in hallowin?
