@iglesiasg	hi
@iglesiasg	any idea about some notebooks not being displayed in http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook?
@iglesiasg	thumbnails are missing too in the demo page
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: works here
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: reload?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, already tried mmm
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, and about the notebooks?
@iglesiasg	I see that at least the LMNN and structured learning ones are missing
@iglesiasg	the dimension reduction one too I think
 sonne|work	demos seems to be b0rken
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: sigh missing " " in the img src
 sonne|work	are causing this
@iglesiasg	heh
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: you mean there are fewer notebooks?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, yeah sure
 sonne|work	I guess the link on our website is wrong then
 sonne|work	I mean current should point to 3.0
 sonne|work	since for some reason FGM's are too slow
@iglesiasg	I actually have no idea why fewer notebooks are shown
@iglesiasg	but it should be due to one of the recent changes
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web/commit/ec218e8cc7950f40d4eb132b0bd6ebe510dc72e8
@iglesiasg	from get_notebook_list("*.ipynb") to get_notebook_list(".ipynb")
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, is that on purpose?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yes that is correct
@iglesiasg	all right
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well buildbot fails!
 sonne|work	and current link seems to be overwritten
@iglesiasg	aargh
 sonne|work	so fewer notebooks
 sonne|work	as I said
 sonne|work	FGM is too slow for soem reason now?!
@iglesiasg	it seems so
@iglesiasg	not good
@iglesiasg	executing locally...

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and?
 sonne|work	how long did it take?
 iglesiasg	sonne|work, the time it normally took when it was well built
 iglesiasg	about 10 minutes in total
 iglesiasg	there is a cell that takes almost 500 seconds
 iglesiasg	the rest are ok
 iglesiasg	but btw, I got an error in one of the first cells, the one that tries to install networkx
 iglesiasg	but that does not seem to be happening in the buildbot so I skipped it
 sonne|work	yeah no that is not it
 sonne|work	sigh
 sonne|work	maybe lets just try again
 sonne|work	shogun-buildbot_: force build --branch=develop nightly_default
 shogun-buildbot_	build forced [ETA 38m09s]
 shogun-buildbot_	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 iglesiasg	let's see
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: did you check what the status of the k-mean centers is?
 iglesiasg	sonne|work, uups no
 iglesiasg	I am doing it right now
 iglesiasg	it is pretty much ready now
 iglesiasg	just a commented SG_UNRED that can be removed
 iglesiasg	and the fail on the travis build is related to what hushell fixed last wekk I think

 van51	hello guys
 sonne|work	hey van51!
 van51	sonne|work: hello :D
 van51	sonne|work: I am back, as promised :)
 van51	I talked to a lecturer here who will be teaching ML next semester and asked him to use shogun in the exercises
 van51	or show some demos at least
 van51	and he said he had heard about shogun and is going to participate in the NIPS workshop
 van51	so, make a good impression!

 sonne|work	van51: ask him what he wants for teaching :)
 sonne|work	van51: I think we should put a lot of focus on shogun for teaching for next gsoc
 sonne|work	as in demos, notebooks
 sonne|work	baseline algorithms needed
 van51	sonne|work: yeah indeed. it would be good to work on those
 van51	sonne|work: he seemed pretty interested in HMM models
 van51	sonne|work: when I see him again I will ask him some more

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: add missing '"'
 sonne|osx	van51: so when you have time do stuff :)
 van51	sonne|osx: do you have something in mind now?
 sonne|osx	van51: well we need demos / notebooks or you could work on this face gender recognition application
 sonne|osx	what you like more
 van51	sonne|osx: I like this face/gender recognition application
 van51	sonne|osx: but I haven't used opencv before
 van51	sonne|osx: I guess I can learn now
 sonne|osx	van51: it is rather easy depending what you want to do
 van51	sonne|osx: I also have an idea for the kmeans demo but I will need the pending PR merged
 sonne|osx	van51: I have some code snippet (which you can find easily on the web too) that detects faces...
 van51	sonne|osx: will I need to create a dataset for that as well?
 sonne|osx	van51: we should maybe aim for sth that does 2 things: a) get the face(s) from an image
 sonne|osx	b) from a camera
 van51	sonne|osx: both sound cool
 van51	sonne|osx: I'll read a bit about it now to get in the spirit
 sonne|osx	van51: well for that we just use opencv's detectors
 sonne|osx	van51: then the 'real' task starts
 sonne|osx	to determine the gender of the person
 sonne|osx	that is something we might need some manual work for (e.g. by labelling a few hundred faces as male / female)
 van51	sonne|osx: the detectors will provide us with the faces, right?
 van51	sonne|osx: no need to work for that
 sonne|osx	yes
 sonne|osx	 not as good as the one vojtech has but at least open source
 van51	sonne|osx: ok I got the idea

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, look now it didn't complete after 1hr! 3600s!
@wiking	sonney2k: can u try it now
@iglesiasg	wtf
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, has someone else tried in his machine?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, don't think so
@sonney2k	I guess there is some real issue still

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, my guess is that it has to be something coming from this commit https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/76f28aa64b64c3d216e0c17aeca05065065d1eda
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what do you think?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I don't see any bug in there
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, is the FGM example using sparse features?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so I have been checking that
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, and I don't see it directly in the notebook giving sparse features, although I have not checked it exhaustively
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, but I have seen that the hushell's factor graph stuff has sparse stuff in many places
@iglesiasg	so, maybe it is used internally?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but then we should see some valgrind activity
@sonney2k	wiking, any chance you can update the template on cloud?
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i just need to sync it first
@wiking	as i've got branched since the last push
@sonney2k	wiking, well it is just the template ~5 lines of code or so
@sonney2k	wiking, we have some issue with nightly_default - we want it to fail when notebooks don't work and not half of the notebooks to be uploaded
@sonney2k	or notebook list did shrink due to some failing :/
@sonney2k	actually one failing
@wiking	sonney2k: easy... set the task a dealbreaker... i.e. buildfailer
@wiking	that way if the notebook generation task has failed then none of the proceeding tasks will be executed
@sonney2k	wiking, well how
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: uh some markdown js
 lisitsyn	let me find
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js probably this one
@sonney2k	wiking, found it haltOnFailure=True
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: http://tapkee.lisitsyn.me/js/markdown.js

@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok I copied the stuff back so we have our 12 notebooks back at least
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, makes sense not sure yet how to do that with shoguns pages (get won't work the *.md's are not in some static dir
@sonney2k	) but I guess I could just put the *.md in a variable and do the same
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, good good
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, the real fix would be to fix the bug though :/
@iglesiasg	let's try to find what is wrong with the FGM notebook in any case
@sonney2k	someone needs to valgrind
@iglesiasg	exactly
@sonney2k	hushell, do you have time for that?
@sonney2k	hushell, the FGM notebook doesn't terminate - even after 1 hour
@iglesiasg	hushell, oh man you are here! Didn't see you, hey there! :)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: add path to shogun sources`
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if you have time you could do the markdown stuff lisitsyn wrote about - so we can have our README.md in the same way on the homepage
@sonney2k	and only maintain *one* readme
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, ok, in the home page?
@iglesiasg	we have an extensive readme so I would say not in the home page
@iglesiasg	probably in the about > information page
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well hide it somewhere under some url first and get all the *.md's as pages
@sonney2k	then we have to think about where to put things
@iglesiasg	all right
