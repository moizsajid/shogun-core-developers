 blackburn	cd to its path and 'make'
 kate__	oh!
 kate__	swig error : Unrecognized option -builtin
 kate__	ok i believe i havent done anything bad to deserve this treatment from shogun...
 blackburn	kate__: did you 'make install' swig?
 blackburn	and did you remove old one?
 kate__	yes
 kate__	yes
 kate__	there is another way to remove the old one from cygwin
 kate__	?
 blackburn	kate__: in setup
 kate__	that i did
 blackburn	are you sure?
 kate__	certain
 blackburn	swig 2.0.4 should support -builtin thing..
 blackburn	write swig -v
 blackburn	write swig -version
 kate__	SWIG Version 2.0.1
 kate__	download 2.0.4
 blackburn	then you should check, in cygwin setup it should not be installed
 kate__	i mean i did downliad
 kate__	yes by the setup its not installed
 kate__	i check it 3 times
 kate__	ok lets see...
 kate__	i do lets say swig its install correctly
 kate__	after i go to shogun/src and press make
 blackburn	it is going to compile
 blackburn	and then after you do 'make install' it works
 kate__	ok what could go wrong?
 kate__	i only did 3 commands?
 blackburn	well kinda complicated commands
 blackburn	once you have swig 2.0.4 shogun should compile smoothly
 kate__	although i did something on my own...and so far its working..i configured the python interfaces and then make
 kate__	and its still works
 kate__	no errors
 blackburn	did it compile succesfully?
 kate__	although there is an unrecognized -pthread
 kate__	no..
 kate__	well i dont know yet
 blackburn	pthread is ok
 blackburn	ok, did 'make' finished?
 kate__	no it still running
 blackburn	ok then lets wait
 kate__	agian with the error
 kate__	again*
 blackburn	builtin?
 kate__	yes
 blackburn	then your swig is not right one
 kate__	can i delete it or update it?
 kate__	if you want to go to sleep its ok...
 blackburn	swig -version?
 kate__	2.0.1
 blackburn	you should remove this one somehow
 blackburn	and 'make install' 2.0.4
 kate__	yes
 kate__	will you be here tomorow morning and offcourse have some free time? i ll have linux tommorow...
 blackburn	kate__: what is morning for you? ;)
 kate__	from 11 o clock and after
 kate__	so in your time i believe 13:00
 blackburn	ok I will be available yes
 kate__	ok so lets no waste your sleep time
 blackburn	no problem
 kate__	in ubuntu i believe its going to be faster and easier
 blackburn	kate__: yes, no need to compile swig
 kate__	nice
 kate__	so see you in the morning?
 blackburn	kate__: sure, but I would ask you to write an email to me
 blackburn	to remind, could you?
 kate__	yes. now?
 blackburn	once you will be online
 kate__	ok
 kate__	no problem
 blackburn	ok so see you
 kate__	?????????
 kate__	goodnight
 blackburn	no idea what it means
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	gamma o o delta
 kate__	i had turned the keyboard in greek
 blackburn	? ??? ?? ????
 kate__	and pressed the keys for goodnight
 kate__	exactly
 kate__	goodnight
 blackburn	did same for russian
 blackburn	hah
 kate__	:)
 blackburn	kate__: how do you write cos, sin , etc?
 kate__	cos = ???
 kate__	sin=???????
 blackburn	and the most important, do you use latin letters for variables?
 kate__	cos= ??????????
 kate__	and tan= ??????????
 blackburn	damn funny hah
 kate__	variables like what?
 blackburn	cos x
 blackburn	or cos gamma
 blackburn	I guess you don't use gamma as variable name, right?
 kate__	no...cos x
 kate__	no
 kate__	in school we used the greek names
 blackburn	ah I see
 kate__	at the university we learn about the latin ones
 kate__	so we can understand foreign papers
 kate__	also when we want to use pi
 blackburn	wonderful
 kate__	we write ?
 blackburn	ah capital p
 blackburn	kate__: we have pretty similar alphabet
 blackburn	?
 kate__	and the ? angle its the same
 kate__	yes
 kate__	we use ? as well
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	ok nice, I thought so but it is pretty interesting still
 kate__	i know what you mean
 kate__	meen
 kate__	do you use other symbols for cos and sin?
 blackburn	kate__: no, no
 blackburn	kate__: in 1930s someone suggested to write it in russian, but thanks gods it wasn't used
 blackburn	??? ???
 blackburn	kate__: I guess greece is the only country that does it :)
 kate__	its not that we dont use it...they believe its easier for a child to learn it in its birth language than a foreign one...but when we go to the unoversity it takes some time to understand the difference between the two of them
 blackburn	I see
 kate__	personally it took me 2 months to learn which is which
 kate__	pi was not so difficult
 blackburn	heh that's funny
 kate__	anyway...if you compare the greek learning system with the europian you will see many bad things in hours
 kate__	but its a long talk
 blackburn	ok :)
 kate__	so goodnight
 blackburn	see you
 kate__	see you in the morning
 blackburn	good night

 kate_	no
 blackburn	sudo apt-get install %package_name%
 kate_	ok

 blackburn	e.g.
 blackburn	sudo apt-get install swig
 blackburn	you can also use <Tab> to autocomplete package name
 kate_	ok swig installed
 kate_	2.0.4
 blackburn	git, pkg-config
 blackburn	python-dev
 blackburn	python-numpy
 kate_	spmothing is wrong
 blackburn	then same thing, git clone git://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 blackburn	what is wrong?
 kate_	git i pressed git pkg-config python dev but it says that its not a git command
 kate_	with the - and all
 blackburn	I meant sudo apt-get install git
 blackburn	sudo apt-get install pkg-config, ..
 kate_	o ok
 kate_	donr
 kate_	all three of the
 kate_	its cloning shogun now
 blackburn	then go to shogun/src and ./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 blackburn	it possibly would fail without some packages though
 blackburn	and you have to install everything it requires
 blackburn	*damn its getting cold*
 kate_	what is the temperature there?
 kate_	and i thing cpp its missing or something else for C++
 kate_	no C++ compiler
 blackburn	gcc
 kate_	i did that
 kate_	i installed them
 blackburn	-12C but feels cold
 kate_	and i entered in shogun src dir
 blackburn	yes
 kate_	here it is 15
 kate_	i pressed ./configure
 kate_	but again swig rewuired
 blackburn	ehm?
 blackburn	what is the error?
 kate_	swig required for modular interfaces
 kate_	thats the error
 blackburn	then you have no swig I guess :)
 blackburn	swig -version?
 kate_	swig version it tells me it 1.3.4
 kate_	i dont get it
 kate_	before it was 2.0.4
 blackburn	kate_: sudo apt-get remove swig
 blackburn	sudo apt-get install swig2<tab>
 kate_	ok
 blackburn	can't remember
 blackburn	there is a package for swig 2
 kate_	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=swig
 kate_	is there is something here i can use?
 blackburn	kate_: what are suggested packages when you do 'sudo apt-get install swig<Tab>'?
 kate_	1.3-doc, 1.3-examples , swig-doc, and swig -examples
 blackburn	then just install swig
 blackburn	should be 2.0.4
 kate_	it says somewhere setting up swig(2.0.4+really1.3.40-3ubuntu4)
 kate_	have you any idea how this works?
 kate_	sorry means
 blackburn	ehmm 'really 1.3.40' is strange
