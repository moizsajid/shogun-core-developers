@sonney2k	alesis-novik, are you around? I haven't heard back from you...
 bettyboo	hello
 alesis-novik	Hello sonney2k, sorry, I wasn't paying attention to IRC. What's up?
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, I didn't see your weekly report - or?
@sonney2k	so I am naturally wondering if everything is going OK
 alesis-novik	I sent it not too long ago. A bit late, sorry about that
 alesis-novik	Yeah, I understand. I'm currently working on Split-Merge EM like I discussed with Vojtech.
@sonney2k	OK, just please take this reporting more serious. It is the only way for me to see if you are making progress when you don't send any patches (IIRC you haven't this week)
@sonney2k	so missing the monthly progress report deadline rings warning bells here.
@sonney2k	anyway weitermachen as we would say in germany
 alesis-novik	Actually sonney2k, should I add the usage examples I made in python somewhere (even though the script need a bit cleaning, it works well)?
@sonney2k	sure - clean it up a bit and then issue a pull request
 alesis-novik	if it has plotting, I should put it in /examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/  ?
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, yes - but make sure you also do some non-graphical variant for illustration that can be run automagically for regression tests

@sonney2k	blackburn, I have a new radical idea
@sonney2k	how about renaming the non-swig interfaces into *-legacy?
 blackburn	python -> python_legacy?
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	why not :)
 blackburn	is it so radical?
@sonney2k	and renaming the modular ones to just python
 blackburn	ahhh
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean currently everyone thinks that python is the thing to install
@sonney2k	though the modular one is what people should use
@sonney2k	same for other languages
@sonney2k	of course we still have issues with octave / swig...
@sonney2k	and with R too

@sonney2k	heiko, how is it going with your bug hunt?
@sonney2k	heiko seems to be in some deep deep forest....
 blackburn	yeah just like me
 blackburn	I finally managed to get some example where arpack shift-inverse mode fails
 blackburn	I guess my fault, not these arpack guys :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, me too btw... I have some numerical problem where the order of summation matters a lot :D
 blackburn	numerical issues all around the world
-!- in3xes_ is now known as in3xes
 heiko	sonney2k, hey, i was having a break :)
 heiko	bug hunt making progress. only one method remaining, but I am writing some more in-depth test cases now to prevent this something like this happening again :)
@sonney2k	heiko, the worst excuse I ever heard :D
@sonney2k	weitermachen then :)
 heiko	i am dabei :)
 heiko	oh its working already
 heiko	only a memory leak
 heiko	about 200 frees of 1500
 heiko	some loop or so
 heiko	sonney2k, a one armed blind man just stole my bugfixes ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: putin made a bug in shift-invert mode of arpack
 blackburn	heiko: try this http://make-everything-ok.com/
 heiko	lol, :)
 heiko	mmh i have to check my pereption ...
 heiko	oh well, found another leak :)
 bettyboo	ho heiko
 blackburn	oh okay my solution is to change 'LM' to 'LA'
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	the only sym to change everything

 heiko	old examples work again
 heiko	oh no, one more example leaks :) hopefully last one

@sonney2k	heiko, well done...
 heiko	soney2k, thanks :)
 bettyboo	cool
@sonney2k	I am still fighting with the gamma function
 heiko	what does it (not) do?
 heiko	yes, simple example runs :)
 heiko	ok, gotta go
 heiko	its late and I have been sitting here for all day, time for some non-computer activity :)
 bettyboo	rotfl
 heiko	sonney2k, have a nice evening
@sonney2k	heiko, I have a deviation of 1e-14 here and don't get it :(

 blackburn	sonney2k: here it is
 blackburn	;)
@sonney2k	bah, I am giving up on the gamma function
@sonney2k	I have to do some more enjoyable programming tomorrow
@sonney2k	otherwise these gamma rays will kill me
 blackburn	what's up with your gamma function?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have a deviation of 1e-14 with lgamma and what I get from matlab
@sonney2k	this doesn't sound bad but this deviation changes the result from 0.82 -> 0.7 in the end
 blackburn	huh
@sonney2k	blackburn, even lgammal (for long double) didn't help
@sonney2k	maybe I have been staring at this for too long now though
 blackburn	lgamma looks like something you could believe..
 blackburn	but matlab too :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: try http://www.wolframalpha.com/ :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I did :)
 blackburn	and?
@sonney2k	I gave up before checking
@sonney2k	will try tomorrow
@sonney2k	(I figured out that lgamma is the problem after 1 day of debugging...)
 blackburn	huh
 blackburn	where do you use gamma function? :)
@sonney2k	in this p value computation stuff
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8e6b8e0 / (2 files):
 CIA-32	shogun: - introduce lgammal
