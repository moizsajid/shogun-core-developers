 blackburn	btw should labels created in apply be SG_REFed?
@sonney2k	these are returned as new objects and so are not used internally
@sonney2k	so no
 blackburn	aha I see
 shogun-buildbot	build #408 of java_modular is complete: Failure [failed git]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/java_modular/builds/408  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
@sonney2k	blackburn, you killed the build :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: lol
@sonney2k	dammed github issue
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw we should all start to use git amend
 blackburn	for what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, to not have stupid/broken git commits
@sonney2k	amend enables merging multiple commits into one big one
 blackburn	probably
@sonney2k	so if sth was forgotten in one commit (missing file, other error)
@sonney2k	buildbot doesn't need to build it
@sonney2k	and fail once
@sonney2k	and then succeed
@sonney2k	and we don't have a crap commit :)
 blackburn	we could also consider bigger commits
 blackburn	actually I try to do all my commits non-breaking anything
@sonney2k	blackburn, bah philipps' opencl test is slower on my GPU
@sonney2k	by a lot ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: than CPU?
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	haha
@sonney2k	like 10 times
@sonney2k	on his it is like 5 times faster
 blackburn	sonney2k: see you

 novice	Hi, can someone help me with github installation ?
 novice	I am trying to set it up in a virtual machine running ubuntu
 novice	added the ssh key, but im unable to test it
 n4nd0	hi novice
 novice	hello :)
 n4nd0	so github is not something you really "install", you need to create an account
 novice	yup created account
 n4nd0	for what you have just said, I understand you have already done this step
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so now you should be able to use git
 n4nd0	git is something you do install
 novice	installed git via sudo apt-get
 n4nd0	ok cool
 novice	I am trying to follow the steps mentioned in the home page after we create an account for the first time
 n4nd0	send me the link please
 novice	it says to genreate ssh key and add it
 novice	k jus a second
 n4nd0	ok
 novice	http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/
 n4nd0	so have you already generated the keys?
 novice	yup
 novice	in the 5th step whihc says test it out
 novice	i get an error which says domain name not registered
 n4nd0	what command are you executing?
 novice	sry the exact error message is ssh: Could not resolve hostname
 n4nd0	ssh -T git@github.com
 novice	http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/
 n4nd0	??
 novice	yup ssh -T git@github.com
 n4nd0	mmm I gind that weird
 n4nd0	find*
 n4nd0	can you try to do: ping github.com
 novice	I am in my college which uses NAT, u think its anythin to do with the firewall of my college?
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: flxb, av3ngr
 n4nd0	well yes it might be they filtered ssh connections, port 22 basically
 novice	ping : unkown host github.com
 novice	ohh
 n4nd0	but that is something they normally do in incoming connections
 novice	ping : unkown host github.com, this si the message i get
 novice	ok
 n4nd0	can you browse github.com??
 novice	yup
 n4nd0	eeeh that is actually weird
 novice	i am able to see the issues of shogun and all
 n4nd0	the shell tells you that it doesn't know where that is
-!- av3ngr [av3ngr@nat/redhat/session] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	but the browser can
 novice	im using virtual box
 novice	and trying to set ii up in virtual box
 novice	it*
 n4nd0	might be something related
 av3ngr	hey novice what network set up did you use in virtual box?
 n4nd0	try to ping 207.97.227.239
 novice	i tried pinging from my windows cmd, it says similar thing
 novice	@av3ngr : i selected teh default option in it, nat

 av3ngr	novice, does ssh work for you normally?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 novice	this is my first time using ssh :|
 n4nd0	novice: what do you with ping to the IP address
 n4nd0	what result do you get*
 av3ngr	n4nd0, it might be because 22 is blocked by the college.
 novice	linux the terminal doenst say anyhting, from windoes host i get 100% loss
 novice	Request timed out
 n4nd0	av3ngr: could be, but now we are just trying to ping
 n4nd0	av3ngr: it is not normal that you can browse a page and the ping doesn't work ...
 av3ngr	yea just realized that - this is odd
 n4nd0	novice: do you browse from windows?
 av3ngr	unless college is blocking ping requests as well
 novice	naa browsing from virtual machine now
 av3ngr	(which is annoying - but often done by college admins_
 n4nd0	I have never seen that, but as you say, may be possible
 novice	lemme just check from my friends room, brb
 n4nd0	ok
 av3ngr	http://returnbooleantrue.blogspot.com.au/2009/06/using-github-through-draconian-proxies.html << might help
 av3ngr	also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5093558/using-github-behind-a-firewall-without-ssh-access

 novice	request timed out for him as well
 n4nd0	av3ngr: yeah! those are good references, probably novice can fix the problem like that

 novice	@av3ngr : checking the links, ty :)
 av3ngr	no worries
 av3ngr	also you could just email the IT admins  to enable ssh for github :)

 blackburn	sonney2k: I give up, you was right
 blackburn	n4nd0: damn this Soeren is wise
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is it now? :)
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 n4nd0	you said that he was right
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	what did you discuss?
 n4nd0	something about STL or another thing?
 blackburn	there is no need for this libedrt
 blackburn	I spent a lot of time for useless shit
 n4nd0	aha, why do you think so?
 blackburn	I got stucked with it
 n4nd0	yeah man ... I checked your pull request, there is lot of stuff there, can't we get something profitable from it?
 blackburn	no need to rewrite things again
 blackburn	well it could be done in an easier way
 blackburn	oh fuck it I'll do this later
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: didn't you send a pull request with kernel multiclass stuff?
 n4nd0	I am on it right now
 blackburn	aha I just get hallucinated probably :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: check this a moment please
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://snipt.org/ughie7
 blackburn	oh shit
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	wtf
 n4nd0	blackburn: is there a way to make presentingPolygon use the method of myGayPolygon??
 n4nd0	it would be useful for the kernel stuff
 blackburn	hahhaah
 n4nd0	I want to have set_subset and remove_subset in Kernel and rewrite them in CustomKernel
 blackburn	it should work well already
-!- jckrz [~jacek@89-69-164-5.dynamic.chello.pl] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
 n4nd0	but the trick is that KernelMulticlassMachine would call the one in CustomKernel when it is one
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	doesn't it?
 n4nd0	no gay polygon on the screen
 n4nd0	just polygons
 blackburn	try to add constructors
 blackburn	and GayPolygon(): Polygon()
 blackburn	oh damn man that's funny
 blackburn	gay polygon
 n4nd0	the same
 blackburn	what if you use pointers?
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	that's a good idea actually
 n4nd0	blackburn: you're wise too :)
 blackburn	so pointers make things work?
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	that's interesting
 n4nd0	I can say a Gay polygon now
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/ughig7
 blackburn	probably your gaypolygon was casted to polygon somehow
 n4nd0	yeah, something like that
 blackburn	actually for methods like that
 n4nd0	I have studied all this stuff at school with java so I know that it can be done
 blackburn	you would rather use const Polygon& poly
 n4nd0	but sometimes I screw when I say ok, how do I do this in C++
 blackburn	but not Polygon poly
 blackburn	try with const Polygon&
 n4nd0	let me see
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	works as well with references
 blackburn	one more puzzle for interview LOL
 blackburn	did you get what is going on?
 n4nd0	I guess that when the function is called
 n4nd0	since the argument was not a reference
 n4nd0	but the type directly
 n4nd0	it was up-casting it
 blackburn	no, it copies
 n4nd0	oh
 blackburn	actually it should copy this instance
 n4nd0	then whatever I give to the function
 blackburn	if it is not a const
 n4nd0	if it is a Polygon
 blackburn	one more idea
 n4nd0	it will be a Polygon
 blackburn	what if you add some field to gay polygon
 blackburn	will it avoid gayness still?
 blackburn	they are almost equal in definition I mean
 n4nd0	I would guess that yes
 n4nd0	but let's check
 blackburn	but actually good lesson there - use const &
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	still not gay if function gets Polygon
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	in fact I didn't get how can you use it for kernels?
 n4nd0	Kernel.h defines set_subset and remove_subset
 n4nd0	or CKernel better
 n4nd0	and CCustomKernel overrides it
 blackburn	yeah right
 Miggy	hi blackburn
 blackburn	hi
 Miggy	do u know if anyone is working on "Built generic multiclass learning framework" project?
 blackburn	working?
 blackburn	not really
 Miggy	i mean has anyone given any proposal for that project?
 Miggy	i m very much interested in doing that project
 blackburn	oh I don't know
 Miggy	ok
 Miggy	blackburn: when does sonney2k come...he is the mentor and i would like to discuss abt the project
 n4nd0	well guys, gtg now
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will push the multiclass kernel stuff a bit later
 n4nd0	bye
 blackburn	n4nd0: see you
 Miggy	n4nd0: u working on multiclass learning framework?
 n4nd0	Miggy: oh sorry, I didn't read
 blackburn	Miggy: just some patch

 n4nd0	harshit_: what about you?
 harshit_	ohh great ..
 harshit_	actually i didnt get time, last 2 days were really hectic for me.. now next 2 days are free

 harshit_	ohh
 n4nd0	go to shogun user and check its repos
 blackburn	git submodule init --update
 n4nd0	there is another one called shogun-data

 harshit_	blackburn : do you knw any multiclass svm classifier that doesnt have its example in octave_modular ?
 blackburn	harshit_: IIRC examples of octave_modular are pretty outdated
 harshit_	so i have created an example where 20NewsGroup dataset is being classified (Actually there is a lil bit of work left ) but i am using cgmnpsvm, whose example exists beforehand
 harshit_	and i am not using any context, its just BOW representation of 20NewsGroup that i am using
 blackburn	harshit_: consider using multiclassliblinear then
 harshit_	okay, thanks blackburn
 blackburn	harshit_: gmnp is kernelized one, no need to use it there
 harshit_	but kernelized features might give better result . no ?
 harshit_	never mind multiclassliblinear example also doesnt exist so i think doing that would be fruitful ..
 blackburn	harshit_: yes if you use good kernel for that
 blackburn	however even linear would work
 harshit_	blackburn : also i was thinking to include some nlp stuff in shogun like porter's algorithm ,or any other stemming algo
 blackburn	feel free!
 harshit_	do you think shogun requires it

 PhilTillet_	I hate jet lag.
 blackburn	heh
 PhilTillet_	I arrived at 2pm, slept more or less until now
 PhilTillet_	Now I am working on my GSoC proposal.
 PhilTillet_	I pretty much got some results with SVM on the GPU
 blackburn	PhilTillet_: actually sonney2k said he has got worse results than you
 PhilTillet_	I know, i saw his mail, the results are weird but I have seen on the internet some complaints about OpenCL on the 9600GT M
 PhilTillet_	so I tested it on a dedicated benchmark platform and got even better results
 PhilTillet_	that is a factor 8
 PhilTillet_	(i7 950 vs GTX 470)
 blackburn	I see
 PhilTillet_	I'll try to test it on more hardware though, and for more problem sizes
 PhilTillet_	Essentially, the results should be about the same then for Matrix-Matrix product
 PhilTillet_	as I am using somewhat the same layout of parallelization
 PhilTillet_	as for* XD (still tired :( )

-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@tillet-p42154.maisel.int-evry.fr] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, reviewing https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/402/files is a pain
@sonney2k	many changes and a lot of them just whitspace
 blackburn	sonney2k: whoaa
 blackburn	sonney2k: does evan want to participate in gsoc?
@sonney2k	but the whitespace fixes seem rightful
@sonney2k	fixes lots of trailing spaces
 blackburn	yeah trailing spaces is shit
 blackburn	sonney2k: any option for vim for that?
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, can the source file i sent to you be considered as the "small patch"? :D

@sonney2k	blackburn, btw https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/397/files also seems nice work
@sonney2k	and a neat example fetching data from uci :)
 blackburn	yeah I thought I suggested it
@sonney2k	at least we never had clustering metrics and I have never heard of munkres before but like the idea of using it to resolve label ambiguity
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is idea he applying for?
 n4nd0	Munkres ... I used that for my sokoban solver, nice algorithm
 n4nd0	blackburn: he is applying for SO :S
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	I feel pain right in my ass thinking about it
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, you need to get into shogun too - the isolated code is very drafty (which is ok at this stage) but it would be a big big plus to have the kernel machine opencl parallelization within shogun
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, ahh btw the code still does not do the 1000 support vectors / 100000 test examples case
@sonney2k	which is the more common case
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, I know you are very busy with conferences and stuff but there is still 1 week...
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, I am done with the conference actually, back in France :) What do you mean with "does not do" ? infinite runtime?
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, well you currently use a case where you have 1000 SVs and 1000 test examples
 PhilTillet	yep
 PhilTillet	and tested it with 10000test example too
 PhilTillet	but the execution time was very long :p
 PhilTillet	i mean i can test it with 100 000 but then I have to take a coffee break lol
 PhilTillet	and I don't like coffee, so let's say a water break
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.4.150] has joined #shogun
 PhilTillet	ok the test case for 100000 test example is launched
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, well 100 times longer
 PhilTillet	I'll run it on that Benchmarking machine, should be faster :p
@sonney2k	yeah just some 30 seconds or so
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, btw I am not happy with the numerical precision though
@sonney2k	I don't see any reason why results should deviate by more than 1e-6
@sonney2k	1e-3 is a lot IMO
 PhilTillet	well, it's 1e-3 over 1000example
 PhilTillet	so 1e-6 per example
 PhilTillet	the norm2 of the difference is still zero from the tests I did
@sonney2k	norm2 is unfair I really mean absdiff
 PhilTillet	And okay i'll try to integrate the OpenCL work into CKernelMachine
 PhilTillet	yes
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, shouldn't your benchmark machine be able to do double btw?
 PhilTillet	it can
 PhilTillet	but not on my mobile GPU
 PhilTillet	:)
@sonney2k	then you could directly compare for the 1000x1000 problem
 PhilTillet	the problem is that the GPU has to be double compatible
 PhilTillet	which is not always the case :p
 blackburn	anyone wanting to port some matlab code?
@sonney2k	yeah yeah but it is important to check if there is a bug (which is what I suspsect)
@sonney2k	blackburn, ???
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is ??? for ? ;)
@sonney2k	matlab code? what are you doing?
 blackburn	sonney2k: easy task - port some dim reduction method
 blackburn	anyway, n4nd0 will care about stochastic proximity embedding next days
 n4nd0	blackburn: let's see how it goes with it ;)
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, the SVM is still training with 100 000 examples :p
 PhilTillet	the training seems quite computationally expensive :p
 blackburn	PhilTillet: what is d and N?
 PhilTillet	N = 100 000, d=1000
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	and kernel?
 PhilTillet	Gaussian
 blackburn	oh that can take a while :)
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, training? why training?
@sonney2k	or do you mean apply?
 PhilTillet	well the SVM is trained before apply
 PhilTillet	does not need to be?
@sonney2k	why that?
 blackburn	PhilTillet:  you probably can set alphas manually..
@sonney2k	just set alphas to 1
 PhilTillet	oh.
@sonney2k	(or random numbers again)
 PhilTillet	:D
@sonney2k	but yes training is very expensive...
 PhilTillet	i'm sure training can also be done on GPU :P
 PhilTillet	but not in 1 week :D
 blackburn	that's something complex
 blackburn	take a look on libsvm source
 PhilTillet	So I have to set the ids of the support vectors manually too?
 blackburn	PhilTillet: yeah just create KernelMachine using custom alphas and indices
 PhilTillet	okay XD
 shogun-buildbot	build #405 of python_modular is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/405  blamelist: pluskid@gmail.com
 blackburn	ehm?!
 n4nd0	I got a graphical example for multiclass kernel machines
 n4nd0	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/multiclass_svm.png
 n4nd0	what do you think guys?
 shogun-buildbot	build #401 of ruby_modular is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/ruby_modular/builds/401  blamelist: pluskid@gmail.com
 blackburn	WOW
 n4nd0	it is a least curious :P
 blackburn	impressive
 blackburn	n4nd0: what is the svm?
 n4nd0	my gf asks why I am doing flowers
 blackburn	tell her because of gay polygon
 n4nd0	LibSVM with GaussianKernel
 blackburn	hmm
 n4nd0	one vs rest
 n4nd0	I am going to try with o.vs.o
 n4nd0	but I think it will be the same
 blackburn	interesting
 blackburn	yeah a little difference
 n4nd0	oh shit, seg fault with one vs. one, got to debug
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, so I should add a clean apply_opencl function to CKernelMachine ?
 PhilTillet	and if possible make it templated so that both apply_opencl<float> and apply_opencl<double> work?

@sonney2k	PhilTillet, well first I would be very interested in seeing the results (much lower error) and comparison to 1000 SVs - 100k test
@sonney2k	then a apply_gpu  makes sense where the old apply code is put into apply_cpu
-!- Vuvu [~Vivan_Ric@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	and then one can set a flag such that apply() uses the cpu or gpu function
