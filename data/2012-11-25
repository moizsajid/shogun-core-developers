 wiking	btw one more question
 blackburn	I mean if I could say it is not stupid
 blackburn	I don't like sgvector and etc
 wiking	#if #elif #else #endif exist
 blackburn	and dynamic* stuff
 blackburn	I feel pain right in my ass even thinking about it
 wiking	so why do we use
 wiking	#if have_eigen #else #if have blas...
 blackburn	no idea :D
 wiking	ok so it's a mistake
 wiking	oh and btw
 wiking	static inline void scale_vector(float64_t alpha, float64_t* vec, int32_t len);
 wiking	how the fuck is this working with gcc?
 wiking	when the implementation is in cpp?
 wiking	i mean sorry i've just added this
 wiking	but with dot product?
 blackburn	good question
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	may be static?
 wiking	ok my bad

 blackburn	first time I see that func
 wiking	http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/browser/vendor/src/atlas-3.8.3/interfaces/blas/C/src/catlas_cset.c?rev=7799
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	so it is atlas not lapack

 cavalier-	hello. Are there any c++ examples of the EDRT?
 wiking	cavalier-: you should ask blackburn
 cavalier-	thanks
 blackburn	cavalier-: still here?
 blackburn	cavalier-: check examples/undocumented/libshogun/converter_*
 blackburn	but actually I could suggest to try https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee as well :)
 blackburn	so what I develop in tapkee is going to be in shogun but in next 2 weeks
 cavalier-	thank's so much blackburn. I'll check out tapkee too
 cavalier-	and generally thank you to everyone who works on shogun. It's helped me to learn so much
