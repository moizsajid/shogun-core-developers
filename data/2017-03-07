 mikeling	Hi, in order to feee the memory in v_array, do you think it's a good idea to add a function named "Deallocate()" in v_array class?
 mikeling	so we can free it's content and memory if we don't need it anymore
 mikeling	wiking: ^

@wiking	?
@wiking	v_array is from c++ lib
@wiking	afaik
 mikeling	wiking: I mean the v_array  in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/lib/JLCoverTreePoint.h#L24
@wiking	std::array
 mikeling	wiking: I haven't get the point...
 mikeling	sorry ;(
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	i dont really geat
@wiking	get
@wiking	why do we need to use that v_array
@wiking	what i'm saying is it'd be cool
@wiking	if we could throw it out
@wiking	and use something more standard
 mikeling	wiking: hmm, so you mean we need to get rid of v_array and use std::array  for JLCoverTreePoint?
@wiking	well if it's possible
@wiking	that'd be great
@wiking	if it's too much of a work then leave it
@wiking	just make sure that you clear the v_array
 mikeling	ok, I got it :)
 mikeling	Thank you
 lisitsyn	I wouldn't try it
 lisitsyn	I have approached JL's code a few times in my life
 lisitsyn	I never succeeded
 lisitsyn	it's a mine field

@HeikoS	wiking: thoughts about the cmake and gpl commit?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ^
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: es bien
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do we have to have shogun_gpl
 lisitsyn	but not shogun/gpl?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: could
@HeikoS	my thinking was
@HeikoS	src/shogun has a certain structure
@HeikoS	and that is replicated in src/shogun_gpl
@HeikoS	i would find it weird to replicate dir structure in a subfolder
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but could do as well?
 lisitsyn	makes sense
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: although
 lisitsyn	we could drop the structure in gpl

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: can we merge bahsic?
 lisitsyn	what is bashic anyway?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I wouldnt do that I think, makes things bessy
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: merge it
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	its merged
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it is a kernel based feature selection algo, based on lamday's 2nd gsoc project
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and in the latest refactoring, HSIC was removed
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I broke something at https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3674
@HeikoS	as BAHSIC is unavailable as well
 lisitsyn	but
 lisitsyn	do you get the idea?
@HeikoS	can re-introduce it
 lisitsyn	the thing is
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I get it, all variables are accessed via getter/setter
@HeikoS	I would do the PR class wise
@HeikoS	not for all at once
@HeikoS	so we can check a bit more
@HeikoS	whether e.g. get/set is a bottleneck etc
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well it is the doable step
 lisitsyn	that leads to tags
 lisitsyn	just make something private and fix stuff
 lisitsyn	once we do that we are blessed
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am just saying that because it is super easy task for applicants
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah good point
@HeikoS	make it entrance task
@HeikoS	write instructions
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: like the kernel thing
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	remember that?
@HeikoS	yeah, well that is more messy
 lisitsyn	the kernel madness gsoc 2011
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so the entrance tags thing should concentrate on parameters that are not part of modelselection
@HeikoS	and make sure the seiralization still works
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: why?
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	we just set them to private
 lisitsyn	that's it
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	no other changes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: dont we eventually want to remove them ?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it enforces the parameter to be accessible ONLY by set/get
@HeikoS	I thought class parameters will disappear completely
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah but it can be drilled down to three steps
 lisitsyn	1) private to force use *available* set/get
 lisitsyn	2) tags under the hood of *available* set/get
 lisitsyn	3) tags *instead* of set/get
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah ok I see, so I agree. Make it a detailed entrance task and link a *minimal* example patch (think the one you did is maybe a bit too big?)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes the w is too big
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: make the task, it is a great idea
@HeikoS	and reference it in the detox2 in the wiki
@HeikoS	this way we increase chances of attracting someone who is good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: send me link, I will polish after
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah once get some time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do it now man, otherwise it wont happen :D
@HeikoS	Just draft I will fill in gaps
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah sure but not now :D

@HeikoS	lambday: sounds good! :)
@HeikoS	lambday: make sure you check all calls of the changed method, should not be too many
@lambday	HeikoS: yep.. did that.. only being used in statistical testing..
@lambday	plus the unit-tests all work, valgrind says green as well
@HeikoS	good thing
@lambday	added one extra unit-test for testing this feature as well.. whether the method is respecting the subsets or not..
@HeikoS	cool
