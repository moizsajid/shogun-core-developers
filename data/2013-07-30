@iglesiasg	hi gsomix!
 gsomix	iglesiasg, hi
 gsomix	and good morning
@iglesiasg	gsomix: yeah good morning, sorry :)
@iglesiasg	gsomix: I think cygwin has some trouble with the quotes in CSVFile, any idea?
@iglesiasg	gsomix: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1115
 gsomix	iglesiasg, yep. fixing.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: cool, thank you!
@iglesiasg	let's see if we can get cygwin happy (looks like an impossible task)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1427 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1427  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>

 gsomix	iglesiasg, hey
 gsomix	iglesiasg, can you merge it? added new unit-test, now all things works right. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1331
@iglesiasg	gsomix: nice!
@iglesiasg	gsomix: are you in a rush to get it merged? Otherwise, let's wait until travis build is done
 gsomix	iglesiasg, ok, let's give him a job. :)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1428 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile octave_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1428  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	gsomix: it is looking nice indeed, I just made a very minor comment
@iglesiasg	gsomix: mmm weird https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/9634442
@iglesiasg	I thought c++11 was already enabled in travis
 gsomix	iglesiasg, aww, ok
 gsomix	I need check one thing
@iglesiasg	gsomix: maybe it was enabled only with clang
@iglesiasg	gsomix: yep, it seems to be that since: Checking for C++11 Atomic Integer ... no
@iglesiasg	gsomix: what compiler do you use locally? If it is g++, did you have to enable C++11 yourself somehow?
 gsomix	iglesiasg, g++, nope. I think I can avoid #include <cinttypes>.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: all right
@iglesiasg	gsomix: otherwise, maybe there is some #ifdef something we can use
@iglesiasg	gsomix: so if Shogun is not compiled with C++11 support, at least we don't get the crash
 gsomix	iglesiasg, do you know why SHOGUN needs to recompile all after commit/rebase/push?
@iglesiasg	gsomix: after rebase yes if any header gets updated
@iglesiasg	gsomix: but after commit/push I don't know
 gsomix	any header? strange. it wants recompile all headers after rebase. :\
 gsomix	ok
 gsomix	need time to compile
* gsomix went for tea.
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	gsomix: yes I mean, in the moment you change a single header (note that this includes classes with templates), everything is re-compiled
 gsomix	lisitsyn, sup, nigga?
 lisitsyn	gsomix: yes
 lisitsyn	or okay :D
 lisitsyn	I don't know what to answer
@iglesiasg	haha
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: how can we send an evaluation for georg?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: apparently I am your mentor too hahaha
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: he is not able to get internet connection at the end?
 lisitsyn	I am terrible
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes he is off
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: let's hope there is no problem to make it on his behalf then
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah we will resolve that for sure
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I submitted my evaluation for your project
 lisitsyn	and it looks like 'submitted'
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: cool, thank you so much then!
 lisitsyn	so I think that can be ok even with one mentor
 lisitsyn	well it was mentioned only 'main' mentor is required
 lisitsyn	I am not the main guy but whatever
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: so you did through your melange, right?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: furthermore that decides whether I can go to SF with sonney2k and HeikoS
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: hehe yeah now you can get your flight there!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I guess it should be fine too. Have you seen any similar query in the mentors mailing list? Do you think we should ask just in case?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ahh it seems there is only one
 lisitsyn	I mean no matter how many mentors you have
 lisitsyn	haha that's crazy because they ask some things like 'have you been a gsoc student'
 gsomix	iglesiasg, ok, next try
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: to increase madness I can submit evaluation for any student
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	haha
@wiking	mornin'
 gsomix	iglesiasg, green :)
 gsomix	wiking, yo
@iglesiasg	wiking: hey!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, wiking: did you guys read from yesterday's logs about the doc sprint?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I didn't
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclog/2013-07-29/ from about 22:19
@wiking	again doc camp?
@wiking	last year we didn't get in
@wiking	:
@wiking	:P
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I think we should try to come up with concrete idea
 lisitsyn	wiking: ^
 lisitsyn	like 'killing hamsters with SVM'
@iglesiasg	eeeh all right :D
@wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	I guess we can write only about SVMs
@wiking	now that we have GP ? :)
 lisitsyn	ahhhh GP
@wiking	comeon :>
 lisitsyn	but I am clueless idiot
@wiking	anywho
@wiking	anyhow
 lisitsyn	no clue about GP at all
@wiking	i can hop on the blue train of doc camp
@wiking	to have 4 ppl
 lisitsyn	we have 4 I think
@wiking	since i have time now :P
 lisitsyn	wiking: haha yeah
@wiking	lisitsyn: i saw from the log: sonney2k heiko and iglesiasg
 lisitsyn	yes and me
@wiking	so they needed +1
@wiking	ah ok
 lisitsyn	wiking: 5 is better
 lisitsyn	?
 lisitsyn	;)
@wiking	then u dont need me :)))
@wiking	but yeah i mean no worries
@wiking	i can come
@wiking	and happy to work on it
@wiking	buuuut
@wiking	cmake has prio
 lisitsyn	wiking: well I can have any kind of trouble
@wiking	so now i'll make a coffee
@wiking	and try to finish that today
@wiking	and then do a rebase
@wiking	and see what happens
@iglesiasg	wiking: full cmake by today?
@iglesiasg	that sounds like a dream!
@wiking	iglesiasg: well it's really fucking working
@iglesiasg	wow, awesome
@wiking	so i dont know why u r surprised
@iglesiasg	:D
@wiking	just really need to finish with the rest of modulars
 lisitsyn	wiking: argh sorry I postpone it all the time :D
@wiking	although i havent even touched static
@wiking	i guess that's needed for matlab as well
@iglesiasg	 all right, looking forward to it then
@iglesiasg	indeed
 lisitsyn	wiking: well we can drop static hahahh
 lisitsyn	that's my dream
 lisitsyn	I have a dream
@wiking	anyhow i want to make first a nice and smooth ccmake menu
@wiking	so now i'll work on that first
@wiking	and then after that i'll see about the interfaces
 lisitsyn	good there is no cccmake
 lisitsyn	and ccccmake
@iglesiasg	:)
@wiking	:>
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I guess we cannot drop static until we get something else for Matlab...
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: of coursssssse
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: wiking: we need something really concrete
 lisitsyn	'SVMs for terribly big data about some shit'
 lisitsyn	'how to sort this shit out with SVMs'
 lisitsyn	whatever
 lisitsyn	(brand new) (with pictures)
 lisitsyn	with such a labels from 90s
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: maybe something related to MKL since sonney2k is the expert?
 lisitsyn	nooo I think we should go for something less 'smart' iglesiasg
 lisitsyn	like the thing for hackers you showed
 lisitsyn	MKL is just a research field
@wiking	oh woah i didn't know about cpack
 gsomix	iglesiasg, lisitsyn, wiking  hey guys, can you push magic "MERGE IT AND MAKE ME HAPPY" button on my PR? :)
@iglesiasg	gsomix: sure
 gsomix	cool
 gsomix	then I can take shower.

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: yeah, it happens a lot :)
 gsomix	general speaking training
 gsomix	guys, what music do you prefer? or what do you listened to the last week/month?
@iglesiasg	gsomix: I am listening these days to the tomorrowland sessions from this weekend
 lisitsyn	I like music from 70s porno movies
@wiking	btw r modular is now fixed?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: haha what kind of music is that? lol
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: oh it sounds like it is from porno

@iglesiasg	gsomix: there is something funny with CSVFileTest.read_matrix unit_test
 gsomix	iglesiasg, mmm?
@iglesiasg	gsomix: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1609/steps/test/logs/stdio
@iglesiasg	gsomix: it crashed in my machine too, as well as ParserTest.tokenization_reals
 gsomix	wut? O_O
 gsomix	iglesiasg, ok, I'll check.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: I am compiling latest code with your new commit just in case that changed something
 gsomix	shower is canceled, huh
@iglesiasg	gsomix: but CSVFileTest.read_matrix crashes in my machine when doing make in tests/unit, not when running it alone though. But with valgrind detects some use of uninitialised memory
@iglesiasg	gsomix: hehe I guess the fix can wait a bit too :)

@wiking	HeikoS: yoyo
@HeikoS	wiking: hello mister
@HeikoS	how are things?
@wiking	working on cmake
@wiking	as soon as i have it ready i'll add those automatic tests
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you think about tests on non-trivial instances?
@HeikoS	like for example DenseFeatures
@HeikoS	which then has a feature matrix, a subset and a preprocessor
@HeikoS	how to implement this best?
@wiking	HeikoS: aaah extra tests for those?
@wiking	ah no idea yet
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	thoralf had the idea of automagically matching types and stuff
@wiking	i'm still trying to get ruby_modular working :)))
@HeikoS	I had the idea to just add a generate_std_instance() to every class
@wiking	i have a SGBase.i:322: Error: Unable to find 'std_vector.i'
@HeikoS	wiking: ah I see
@HeikoS	yeah, so lets do this later :)
 thoralf	Hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	thoralf: hey
@HeikoS	thoralf: lets discuss with wiking at some point all our ideas
@HeikoS	wiking: but the automagic tests already revealed 100s of bugs
@HeikoS	very useful

@HeikoS	if we have non-trivial tests, we can finally rely on serialisation etc
 thoralf	HeikoS: Of course.  Let's make an appointment.
@wiking	HeikoS: what would u like to have in non-trivial tests again?
@iglesiasg	hello hello
@HeikoS	wiking: currenlty, we do the automated tests on classes that have been generated with std constructors
@HeikoS	wiking: which means that everything is NULL, 0, -1 or similar
@HeikoS	wiking: but it would be good to also have concrete data in them
@HeikoS	and then test equals/clone/save
@HeikoS	will detect more problems
@HeikoS	and makes all these methods very stable
@wiking	HeikoS: well then we have to use the non default ctors ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: but how to do that for all classes automatically?
@wiking	HeikoS: aaall classes?
@HeikoS	wiking: there are also sometimes constraints on what data is allowed
@wiking	HeikoS: problem is that the non std ctor varies a lot
@HeikoS	wiking: so I had the idea to force people to implement a method that creates at least one non-trivial instance
@HeikoS	and then we can use that recursively to create tests
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: ping
 gsomix_	iglesiasg, pong
@wiking	HeikoS: mmmm lemme think about this a bit
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: news about CSVFile tests?
@HeikoS	wiking: CSGObject* CSGObject::create_non_trivial_instance()=0;
@HeikoS	wiking: which is implemented by the person who creates the class
@HeikoS	since he knows what to do
 gsomix_	iglesiasg, working. have many issues with ref/unref. :(
 thoralf	HeikoS: Ah, you're discussing right now.
@HeikoS	wiking: thorals suggested that this should not be in the class definition itself but somewhere else to keep code clean from tests
@HeikoS	thoralf: no, just giving wiking the ideas we had
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: all right, get them tiger! :P

 gsomix_	HeikoS, iglesiasg hey, can you help me? when I create SGObject by using new, should I do SG_REF()?
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: no, there is no need
 thoralf	HeikoS: Let's go https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1332
@iglesiasg	gsomix_: it shouldn't hurt either. You will have to do SG_UNREF afterwards anyway
@HeikoS	gsomix_: what exactly is the problem?
@HeikoS	gsomix_: you should SG_REF it only if you want to keep the reference and use it later
@HeikoS	gsomix_: for example when you store it as a class member
 gsomix_	HeikoS, yeah. it's all that I need.
@HeikoS	gsomix_: then REF when you create and unref in destructor

@sonney2k	HeikoS, wiking hey there
@HeikoS	sonney2k: hi!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so what about doc camp?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: hey
@HeikoS	I checked a bit what they do there
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you, iglesias & me and wiking? lisitsyn?
@HeikoS	I am not sure whether its applicable for us
@sonney2k	HeikoS, they write a book :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: its larger projects, large groups of users etc
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so not sure
@HeikoS	would be cool though
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes sure large as in KDE big
@sonney2k	s/big/size
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yep
@sonney2k	but apart from that it fits
@HeikoS	sonney2k: and what would we write about?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, maybe the big data hype could pay off
@HeikoS	sonney2k: haha yeah maybe
@HeikoS	ok then
@sonney2k	HeikoS, everything we have in shogun
@HeikoS	we can recycle last years application
@sonney2k	as in kernels, distances, kernel / distance machines
@sonney2k	etc etc
@sonney2k	it is doable IMHO
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I would rather not focus on the algorithms I think
@HeikoS	having seen what was done last year
@HeikoS	more like how development works, how to install, how to use, some basic algorightms ...
@HeikoS	not too mathematical
@HeikoS	and not a list of things
@HeikoS	but more an introduction to the concepts
@HeikoS	wiking: how to use the new random number generator?
@HeikoS	wiking: where is the instance ?

@wiking	sonney2k: cmake created the following lib for me: libjava_modular.jnilib
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh ok that doesn't work then :)
@wiking	sonney2k: but it should be ok i just need to rename it to libmodshogun.so during installing
@wiking	and that should be find
@wiking	*fine
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh ok
@wiking	ok so lua, ruby, python and java modular are compiled fine with cmake
@wiking	so now what we are actually missing is csharp, r, octave and matlab_static
@sonney2k	wiking, piece of cake then when you've come that far
@wiking	well yeh
@wiking	although i should do some more checks
@wiking	and then i should still work on the compiler flags
@wiking	as i really haven't even touched that part
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah well it is some hefty project
@sonney2k	it might take another (few) months to complete
@wiking	noway

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: around?
@HeikoS	I need c++ help :)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: cool!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	or anyone else?
@wiking	tell
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok, I warn you, basic stuff ;)
@HeikoS	so I have a base class and a class that inherits from the base
@HeikoS	this call works
@HeikoS	float64_t result=((CProbabilityDistribution*)gauss)->log_pdf(x);
@HeikoS	and this call gives me a compile error
@HeikoS	float64_t result=gauss->log_pdf(x);
@HeikoS	why?
 lisitsyn	what is the type of gauss?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: needed to set the number of return arguments
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ahh
@HeikoS	gauss is of type CGaussian which inherits from CProbabiltyD...
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: then it should work :D
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I believe the same fix needs to be applied to the embed method
@HeikoS	I know, but it doesnt, what are the caveats one can do while inheriting things?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: oh please do it then
@HeikoS	I checked all I know but  still ...
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: log_pdf is virtual, righT?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	virtual float64_t log_pdf(SGVector<float64_t> single_sample) const;
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I'm just going to port an example of using the embed converter to one of the static interfaces as we currently don't have any
 gsomix	maybe dynamic_cast is needed?
@HeikoS	gsomix: would work, since the static one works
@HeikoS	but why does the compiler complain?
@HeikoS	error: no matching function for call to 'shogun::CGaussianDistribution::log_pdf(shogun::SGVector<double>&)'
@HeikoS	thats the error
@HeikoS	float64_t result=gauss->log_pdf(x);
@HeikoS	and thats the call
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no I see no reason actually
@HeikoS	where x is SGVector
@HeikoS	inheritance is public
@HeikoS	static cast works, thats the weirdest
@HeikoS	and the method is virtual
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so if you do this with static cast
 lisitsyn	you get no error?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	(it also runs)

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: the only caveat I can imagine is different declarations of that method
@HeikoS	it is only defined in base class
@HeikoS	nowhere else
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it public'ly inherited?
 lisitsyn	like
 lisitsyn	class CGaussian: public CProbabilityDistribution?
@HeikoS	class CGaussianDistribution: public CProbabilityDistribution
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it implemented in CGaussianDistribution?
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	in base class
 gsomix	is method also public? just for check.
@HeikoS	gsomix:  yes
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi! The difference between our implementation of logit likelihood and GPML is less than 1e-3. Is it Ok?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: uh, thats not so precise
@HeikoS	votjakovr: can you test a more complex case?
@HeikoS	if it stays that low, its ok
@HeikoS	but better check
@HeikoS	so yes for now, but please check a bit after you sent the PR
 votjakovr	HeikoS: we have more accurate integral evaluation than GPML has
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I know
 votjakovr	HeikoS: absolute tolerance is something about 1e-10
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have no ideas left
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I think it is fine, but pls have a look at an example with a bit more data
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: weird stuff ....
 lisitsyn	:/
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but it would make sense to carefully check definitions
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: did 10 times already, maybe tomorrow again
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: then something else yeah

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Implemented evaluation of predictions for logit likelihood
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so the logit classification stuff works now? :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep, but i think it needs an example :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: very nice!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: could you write a simple and basic example for GP classification in c++ and in python_modular?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: just very very basic api usage and how to obtain predictions/confidences
@HeikoS	votjakovr: to make it easy for users to play with that
@HeikoS	votjakovr: big example will follow
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe in the example just use both likelihood we currently have and laplacian, but comment out all but one
@HeikoS	votjakovr: should be quickly be done since the stuff is already tested
 votjakovr	HeikoS: sure, i'll do that :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: btw do GPs work well with python_modular now? I mean there was some problems
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I fixed that :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: there is a new GaussianProcess.i file now, check it out
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oh, thanks!
@HeikoS	everything is added in there
@HeikoS	votjakovr: the example can really be simple api demonstration ones, no need for fancy ML in there
@HeikoS	maybe a few comments on what is possible
 votjakovr	HeikoS: btw shouldn't we again report to Carl about the problems?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yep I agree, I think this time we are right since it seems to be an octave bug ;)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: could you send me your fix diff?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hmm, i've just replaced 32th line with: s2zero = 1; if nargin>3, if length(s2)>0, s2zero = 0; end, end         % s2==0 ?

 lambday	HeikoS: today my prof gave me a long lecture about how I am not doing anything significant for the lab while I've working for GSoC and actually doing something! I am not sure how I should take this :D he seems quite pissed off :(
 lambday	HeikoS: oh and regarding the computation framework, there is a part in one of my lab's project where there are parallel computation of individual computable components are required
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah I know sorry
 lambday	HeikoS: I said, that I probably can give something in that.. they exactly need to the openmpi implementation stuffs..
 lambday	HeikoS: may be after GSoC we can discuss?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah

@HeikoS	but thats all later
@HeikoS	for now, make your prof happy and finish log-dets :)
@HeikoS	but very cool stuff
 lambday	HeikoS: yes... me too
@HeikoS	I in fact had a meeting today, talking about large-scale implementations of the log-determinants
 lambday	HeikoS: seems tha computation framework is going to be used by many many people! :D that makes me really happy :D
@HeikoS	and we will probably here build a large system for that...
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah totally

 gsomix	iglesiasg, finally I learned how to work with SGObjects.
 gsomix	good evening
@iglesiasg	gsomix: cool!
@iglesiasg	gsomix: do you feel like writing about it? maybe we can put it in the website so it is useful for everybody
@iglesiasg	gsomix: a very few lines would be enough
 gsomix	iglesiasg, hm, good idea.
@iglesiasg	gsomix: or maybe just a mail in the mailing list like what you did for git flow
 gsomix	huh, now it is hard time at my university. many school leavers tries win admission to SSAU.
 gsomix	a lot of buzz in internets
@iglesiasg	gsomix: school leavers? What did they do?
@iglesiasg	stop studying or so?
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I mean many people after high school ties enroll at university. now it's time.
 gsomix	*tries
@iglesiasg	gsomix: aaah ok, got it
@iglesiasg	gsomix: I have a question btw

@iglesiasg	gsomix: is start given some value by default? I thought local variables are not given any default value and this may cause problems in this example
@iglesiasg	gsomix: valgrind does not complain here about anything, so I am just wrong probably, sorry.
 gsomix	iglesiasg, hm, next_token_idx gets reference to 'start' variable and initializes it
 gsomix	http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.2832.pdf --- best abstract
 gsomix	iglesiasg, but I can init it with value by default. not problem :)
@iglesiasg	gsomix: no, no need sorry

 gsomix	sonney2k, hey
@sonney2k	gsomix, wassup?
 gsomix	sonney2k, I will not available tomorrow at morning and day. want to visit lecture of Nobel prize winner 2000
 gsomix	sonney2k, I fixed today some bugs related to memory and ref/unref.
@sonney2k	gsomix, I hope you wrote some unit tests for that?
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, I wrote additional unit-test for reading/writing integers in csv. but for ref/unref test are the same
 gsomix	*tests
 gsomix	sonney2k, I just learned how we works with SGObjects in SHOGUN, no more.
 gsomix	sonney2k, but I found bad case for CircularBuffer today. so I plan to refactor and simplify it for further support. I think it takes me one evening (tomorrow?)
 gsomix	now I have CircularBuffer at paper and it works fine. :D
 gsomix	next I can finish libsvm and quoting.
 gsomix	sonney2k, all ok?
@wiking	sonney2k: ping
@wiking	lisitsyn: check this shit, it's really cool: http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:Component_Install_With_CPack
 lisitsyn	wiking: checking
@wiking	lisitsyn: its really cool. with the current structure of cmake i can easily create different components, i.e. packages like deb, rpm for the modular interfaces
 shogun-buildbot	build #1437 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1437  blamelist: Evgeniy Andreev <gsomix@gmail.com>, Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 lisitsyn	wiking: well easily?
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	I am usually quite stucked with that shit
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah easily since i just have to add one extra line into INSTALL(...) lines (COMPONENT python_modular....)
@wiking	and after that i we just have to define what kind of cpack generator we want to use
@wiking	like deb, rpm, tar.gz, tar.bz2 etc.
@wiking	good shit ;)
@wiking	and after this we just have a new build target: make package
@wiking	and that'll generate the packages ;P
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah that's cool indeed
@iglesiasg	wiking: magic!
@wiking	yeah it's all fucking magic with cmake :)
@wiking	although one big target is still missing from the current setup
@wiking	make tests
@wiking	:D
@wiking	the rest is solved
@wiking	although a rebase will give me some headache
@wiking	ok back to finish up make tests :)

@sonney2k	wiking, yeah that won't work for debian packages but sure for pure data containers it would
@sonney2k	gsomix, well eah
@sonney2k	yeah
@wiking	sonney2k: ?
@wiking	sonney2k: why wouldn't it work?
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean i get it that we have a compilation size problem to get the debian packages into the debian upstream but hack we still can provide the deb packages ourselves... same with rpm

@sonney2k	wiking, the biggest issue w/ creating a .deb / rpm is to have a proper license file, dependencies complete and use the native build system (of e.g. dh_python2 in debian) - so you manually need to write some control, rules and, copyright file

@wiking	sonney2k: dude have u read the wiki?
@wiking	sonney2k: cpack generates most of the files for u
@wiking	and uses native tools
@wiking	hence i cannot generate deb packages with cmake on my osx

@sonney2k	argh somebody broke gaussianprocessregression
@sonney2k	...in modular interfaces
@wiking	sonney2k: i.e. i've just created a shogun.dmg with it and it used the native PackageMaker of OSX
@wiking	so it's pretty cool
@sonney2k	wiking, sounds like!
@sonney2k	wiking, that certainly would solve the complaints we were hearing at the WS

@wiking	sonney2k: why not?
@sonney2k	wiking, look at the current debian package
@sonney2k	it is not that trivial
@sonney2k	wiking, https://bollin.googlecode.com/svn/shogun/trunk/debian/
