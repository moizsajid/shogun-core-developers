 blackburn	I am not shy with my alcohol addiction
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I realized he gets funnier at nights :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, tell n4nd0 about your bear!
 blackburn	oh its huge
 n4nd0	what kind of bear are talking about?
 blackburn	my bear
 blackburn	he drinks a lot of vodka
@sonney2k	the one from siberia
 blackburn	and eats people
@sonney2k	kind of a pet blackburn has at home
 n4nd0	you're kidding guys
 n4nd0	I already tried that joke with polar bears with Spanish friends when I came to Sweden
@sonney2k	I think he walks out his bear daily - scaring away people
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	wanna see my best photo?
 blackburn	http://cs579.userapi.com/u5562488/65536566/x_45297eef.jpg
 blackburn	LOL
 n4nd0	haha wtf
 n4nd0	it was just a set-up for the photo?
 blackburn	unfortunately no
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I should be ashamed of it probably but it is funny as hell
@sonney2k	that's before blackburn is getting up - blood level too high (not enough alcohol-aka-fuel in blood yet)
 blackburn	actually it was new year celebrations
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	no too bad for new years then
 blackburn	I've got one more funny photo from school
 blackburn	http://cs305.userapi.com/u18261492/43807744/x_942ecb5b.jpg
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: this time yes - it is a set-up ;)
 n4nd0	a Russian friend told me that people are more lucid when they drink ... then I started to believe stories about vodka :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: good you said it :P
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you guys have to go with suits to school?
 blackburn	but it is not a photoshop or anything
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes, we used to wear suits in school

 blackburn	hmm I've got uncatchable bug
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: sonney2k: good night guys
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know this https://code.google.com/p/c45/
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	no
@sonney2k	seems like someone wrote c45 in c++
@sonney2k	...and is applying for gsoc
@sonney2k	no idea how good his impl. is though...
@sonney2k	but he could be the guy doing id3 / c45 / c50 / random forests
 blackburn	or girl according to email
 blackburn	ok see you

@sonney2k	night
 n4nd0	good night
 n4nd0	sonney2k: StreamingFeatures cannot be used directly by classifiers right?
 n4nd0	in order to read from a file, I have to use StreamingFeatures to read the file and fill a e.g. CSimpleFeatures
 shogun-buildbot	build #400 of java_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/java_modular/builds/400

 pluskid	Finally figured out why I still cannot submit my application: I mistakenly registered as a mentor...
 pluskid	Writing to GSoC to fix this
 n4nd0	pluskid: curious fact :)
 pluskid	n4nd0: I think maybe I clicked the wrong button when registering :(
 pluskid	Though I can simply register another account with another email :D
 n4nd0	fast solucion :)
 n4nd0	solution*
 pluskid	n4nd0: you are a GSoC, too, aren't you?
 pluskid	student
 n4nd0	well, I try to be one
 pluskid	Cool, what idea are you working on?
 n4nd0	SO
 n4nd0	what about you?
 pluskid	what do you mean by SO?
 pluskid	I'm trying to work on structured output learning, is it the same topic to you?
 n4nd0	oh sorry, Structured Output
 n4nd0	yeah, it seems so :S
 pluskid	hmm...
 pluskid	there are two topics related to SO
 pluskid	Built generic structured output learning framework
 pluskid	and Bundle method solver for structured output learning
 pluskid	which one are you working on?
 n4nd0	I am with the first one
 pluskid	OMG...
 n4nd0	:S
 pluskid	You have been very active here, I should catch up... >_<
 n4nd0	well it looks like you have quite a bit of experience in ml (info in your presentation mail) it's me who should catch up actually ;)

 zxtx	wasn't SO on the list last year?
 n4nd0	no idea
 pluskid	no idea, too. Haven't participated last year.
 pluskid	n4nd0: Yes, both of us have our own strength. But I think I should start to consider applying one more project/organization for the sake of conflict.
 zxtx	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc/ideas-2011.html#so
 n4nd0	pluskid: probably, I think I will apply for a second project in shogun as well
 pluskid	me too, because shogun is really an ideal project to work with.
 pluskid	maybe we should discuss before we choose our second idea
 pluskid	to avoid a 2nd conflict :D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I already thought of generic multiclass
 n4nd0	what about you?
 pluskid	haven't decided yet
 pluskid	maybe I will consider other ideas, since you chose MTL
 pluskid	I'm still reading the details about other ideas
 n4nd0	ok
 pluskid	I will tell you when I have a decision
 n4nd0	pluskid: cool, thanks :)

 pluskid	n4nd0: Maybe I'll choose MTL.... but another MTL: Implement multitask and domain adaptation algorithms
 pluskid	or Kernel Two-sample/Dependence test
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I think someone else is with the multitask
 n4nd0	but it's rather difficult to avoid competence
 pluskid	yes :(
 zxtx	does anyone ever need multitask learning in practice?
 pluskid	it seems useful, because many tasks alone have too few information to work out a good model.
 pluskid	But I don't know about the real-world application side
 zxtx	well it seems you just need a good prior across tasks
 zxtx	anyway clearly not a project I should be a mentor or student on :P
 pluskid	zxtx: yes, but I guess in MTL the piror can be learned automatically from the data, instead of made by the expert :p

 harshit_	hey sonney2k
 harshit_	hey n4nd0
 n4nd0	hey harshit_ how is it going?
 harshit_	good . whats up on your side ?
 n4nd0	just fine :)
 harshit_	so i read the irclog
 harshit_	and i think my deep learning thing could not work in this gsoc
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	did you take a look to those references sonney2k talked about?
 harshit_	but still i can implement it after gsoc ( or if i dont get into gsoc)
 harshit_	yeah
 n4nd0	ok, then it's good
 harshit_	they are basically big toolboxes
 harshit_	based on Neural networks
 harshit_	so extracting deep learning algos from them is a real pain
 n4nd0	I see
 harshit_	and you were also talking about implementing decision trees
 n4nd0	yes
 harshit_	C5.0 code seems to be easy, but i wonder why blackburn kept on saying
 n4nd0	it looks like shogun needs them very bad
 harshit_	that implementing that is really difficult
 harshit_	oh i se
 harshit_	see*
 harshit_	but if C5.0 code is in C then what is so difficult in implementing it in shogun ?
 harshit_	do you have any idea
 n4nd0	well probably it is not so difficult as you have said
 n4nd0	but it is not going to be probably just copy + paste
 n4nd0	one probably has to adapt it to shogun's structure (e.g. using SGVectors, SGMatrices and the like)
 n4nd0	I have not really looked into that project though
 harshit_	okay..
 harshit_	i'll have a talk with blackburn though,
 harshit_	Coz after implementing newtonsvm my project seems to be small
 n4nd0	I think it's a good idea
 harshit_	i need something else to add to that project
 harshit_	do you know of anything that could be added to it !!
 n4nd0	there must be other tree implementations that could be useful to have
 n4nd0	didn't they mention something about it? I think I have heard it
 harshit_	other tree implementations ?? as in
 harshit_	you talking about c4.5 or other implementation of c5.0 itself
 n4nd0	ahm
 harshit_	i think blackburn will give me a closer idea..
 harshit_	and some trivial questions:
 harshit_	what are these shogun-builtbot and shogun-toolbox in chat area
 harshit_	and how is sonney2k always available
 n4nd0	shogun-buildbot just gives some log information about the state of the build of the project
 n4nd0	you do a pull request for example, sonney2k merges it
 n4nd0	and a automatic process of building the project starts
 harshit_	okay got it
 n4nd0	this guy shogun-buildbot gives us feedback on IRC about how did that process go
 n4nd0	checked some of the links it gives if you want
 n4nd0	I have no idea what shogun-toolbox does
 harshit_	and second question how is sonney2k always available
 harshit_	yeah i checked once..
 n4nd0	and well sonney2k may have an IRC client connected all the time
 n4nd0	but that doesn't mean he is online all the time
 harshit_	yeah..
 n4nd0	you should ask him about it if you are curious :)
 harshit_	i would i want to do it with my account too :)

 Marty28	Could anyone please tell me if the toolbox is ready for Python 3.1?
 blackburn	Marty28: almost, gsomix works on it actualyl
 blackburn	actually*
 Marty28	Ok, so I will better go on with 2.7 for the next months.
 Marty28	Is there a random DNA/RNA sequence generator with motifs included in shogun somewhere?
 blackburn	I haven't seen any :)
 Marty28	I am currently programming one, but I want it to be realistic.
-!- jckrz [~jacek@89-69-164-5.dynamic.chello.pl] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	hey blackburn
 blackburn	harshit_: hi
 Marty28	hiho
 harshit_	sonney told me  not to use get_computed_dot_feature_matrix() function
 harshit_	and use add_to_dense() etc
 blackburn	yes makes more sense
 harshit_	but the problem is that i want that matrix for cblas_dgemm
 harshit_	so is there any way out ?
 blackburn	what is the matrix you compute?
 harshit_	i dont compute any matrix
 harshit_	its just the feature matrix entered by user
 blackburn	what is the matrix you compute with dgemm?
 harshit_	actually it has been used at alot of places
 harshit_	in one place i have to get a subset of feature matrix
 blackburn	gram or covariance?
 harshit_	with given rows
 harshit_	gram , covariance ?? i dont get it
 blackburn	e.g. X'X is a gram matrix
 blackburn	and XX' is a covariance matrix
 blackburn	where X is a feature matrix
 harshit_	ohh
 harshit_	gram
 harshit_	then
 blackburn	you may employ linear kernel for that
 blackburn	or compute it manually
 blackburn	while (i,j) slot contains just a dot product between ith and jth vectors
 harshit_	okay.. got it
 harshit_	but that would require complete redesign of whole program
 blackburn	why?
 harshit_	I dont get that why cant we make use of whole feature matrix
 harshit_	does that slows down the program ?
 blackburn	no, but whole feature matrix could be huge

 harshit_	okay.. then i think its worth working on that.
-!- jckrz [~jacek@89-69-164-5.dynamic.chello.pl] has quit []
 blackburn	main point is that you should avoid this access operations and use add and dot ops when possible
-!- hpsoar [7c108901@gateway/web/freenode/ip.124.16.137.1] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	yeah got it , Bcoz thats the reason why COFFIN framework was built .
 harshit_	hey blackburn i am using CDotFeatures for features but in this class add_to_dense and dense_dot are virtual, so do i need to use some other type of features in my program
 blackburn	no, it is ok
 blackburn	it is an abstract class for other features
 blackburn	so e.g. SimpleFeatures has implementation of these methods
 harshit_	but then i could not make use of add_to_dense once i type cast to cdotfeatures
 blackburn	why?
 harshit_	bcoz it wont knw which implementation to use
 harshit_	i am not sure actually
 blackburn	you don't have to know :)
 harshit_	okay ... i'll try it and get back to you in a moment.
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you have any example reading from .mat like we do with loadmat in python examples but in C++?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am doing one using Streaming objects but I think I am not getting it well
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh.. no, I never tried to do it with C++
 blackburn	why do you want to work with .mat from C++?
 n4nd0	I just want to use data files from C++
 blackburn	http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/clustering.html#overview-of-clustering-methods
 n4nd0	they don't have any specific format, just one line with two floats
 n4nd0	should I use shogun stuff to read them or standard C++?
 n4nd0	nice plot
 harshit_	hey, what is dense vector in shogun ?? i mean why is dense word used in every function in Cdotfeatures
 n4nd0	harshit_: is just a normal matrix, non sparse
 harshit_	matrix ??
 blackburn	vector matrix all the same :)
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	:)

 harshit_	i hav an issue with add_to_dense_vec() function
 harshit_	hav you used it anywhere ?
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.170.214] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	harshit_: I think I have not used it, but tell me anyway
 harshit_	firstly i need  to confirm that whether matrices are stored in shogun in column major order or not
 harshit_	i think they are stored in column major .. yes
 harshit_	?
 n4nd0	yes they are
 harshit_	problem is that add_to_dense_vec gives me the results, considering features matrix is stored as row major
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	so you are using CDotFeatures?
 harshit_	do you knw any place where i can upload small scripts ?
 harshit_	yes sort of coz simplefeatures is derived from CDotFeatures only
 n4nd0	if you mean code I use this http://snipt.org/
 harshit_	nice site, have a look at a small portion of my code :http://snipt.org/uggF9
 harshit_	here when i use CMath::display_matrix(sgv.vector,x_d,1); it shows me 1 2 3
 harshit_	rather than 1 4 7
 harshit_	same is the case with add_to_dense_vec
 n4nd0	let me think of it a moment
 harshit_	ok
 n4nd0	so sgv is the first vector of features
 n4nd0	i.e. the first column of matrix
 n4nd0	so then I think it's normal that it's 1 2 3
 harshit_	it should be first row of matrix !
 n4nd0	why the first row?
 n4nd0	as we said they are stored column wise in shogun
 harshit_	but still if then if it first vector (or first coloumn ) then it should contain x_n elements
 n4nd0	and here x_n is?
 n4nd0	what are the values of x_n and x_d here?
 harshit_	x_n: no of features .. ie no rows
 harshit_	and x_d is no of dimensions
 n4nd0	yeah ... but I mean the particular values you are using
 harshit_	see matrix is [1 4 7;2 5 8 ;3 6 9]
 harshit_	ohh its 5 for x_n and 3 for x_d
 n4nd0	in any case I think you got it the other way round
 n4nd0	look at the constructor in CSimpleFeatures http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/SimpleFeatures_8cpp_source.html#l00032
 n4nd0	the one in line 32
 n4nd0	num_feat (your x_d here) is for the rows
 n4nd0	and num_vec (your x_n) for the number of cols
 n4nd0	got it?
 harshit_	but i have used set_feature_matrix
 harshit_	and in set_feature_matrix() first argument is num_feat and second is num_vec
 harshit_	and i have used x_d for first
 harshit_	and x_n for second
 n4nd0	yeah but why did you make that?
 harshit_	just for understanding this function
 n4nd0	I mean
-!- jckrz [~jrzeniewi@89-69-164-5.dynamic.chello.pl] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	SGMatrix<float64_t> matrix(x_n,x_d);
 n4nd0	first x_n and later x_d
 n4nd0	why
 n4nd0	features->set_feature_matrix(matrix.matrix,x_d,x_n);
 n4nd0	the other way round
 harshit_	coz SGMatrix constructor says to have first arg as no of rows and second as no of columns
 harshit_	if i do other way around i get an assert error
 harshit_	hey u figured out something
 n4nd0	I don't know if you see what happens
 n4nd0	it is like if you have this matrix
 harshit_	may be i should not use SGMatrix
 n4nd0	[1 3 5; 2 4 6]
 n4nd0	and you build it doing SGMatrix< float64_t >(2, 3)
 harshit_	wait i'll give it a try
 n4nd0	and later you do features(matrix, 3, 2)
 n4nd0	you will tell to features that the matrix is
 harshit_	in first case ie with the matrix you wrote
 harshit_	sgv vector displays 1 2 3
 n4nd0	exactly]
 harshit_	whereas it should display 1 3 5
 harshit_	how
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	each feature vector is a column
 harshit_	okay agreed
 n4nd0	I know that the notation might be confusing
 harshit_	but then column should have 2 members
 harshit_	take a practical example
 n4nd0	I don't know what you mean with but then column should have 2 members
 n4nd0	ok I think I got it
 n4nd0	yeah it should be like that
 n4nd0	but the problem is when you do features->set_feature_matrix(matrix.matrix,x_d,x_n);
 n4nd0	changing the order

 n4nd0	you create it with x_n, x_d
 n4nd0	and set it with x_d, x_n
 n4nd0	when your matrix really means
 n4nd0	[1 3 5; 2 4 6]
 n4nd0	you make believe to features that it is
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	but doing that results in an error
 n4nd0	I guess the error must come from another thing that is wrong
 harshit_	i think best way to debug this is to drop SGMatrix for now and feed simplefeatures normal matrix
 n4nd0	mmm I don't think so
 n4nd0	when you change to x_d, x_n
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Client Quit]
 n4nd0	everything must work well until SGMatrix<float64_t> sgmatrix=features->get_computed_dot_feature_matrix();
 n4nd0	right?
 harshit_	wait let me use gdb
 harshit_	it is good till add_to_dense_vec () function
 harshit_	and sgv displays : 1 2
 harshit_	and matrix is= [1 4; 2 5 ; 3 6]

 harshit_	dam this is really confusing
 harshit_	i think i need to have a closer look at how other implementations make use of add_to_dense_vec() function
 n4nd0	I think you've to think how it is stored in memory
 n4nd0	is just an array
 n4nd0	a vector is an array a matrix is also an array
 harshit_	yeah right
 n4nd0	for matrices the dimensions are the ones that define them, and are really important
 harshit_	but see here dimensions are alright i mean whe i use get_dim_feature_space it returns 3
 harshit_	exactly the value i used while defining matrix
 harshit_	and when i use add_to_dense_vec it also returns 3 values
 harshit_	but it returns those 3 values considering the matrix as row major
 harshit_	but actually it is stored in column major in features
 harshit_	i think we need blackburn around here for this ..
 harshit_	or perhaps sonney2k
 harshit_	i think i am messing up with x_n and x_d ..
 harshit_	function could not be wrong ..
-!- Miggy [~piggy@14.139.82.6] has joined #shogun
 harshit_	Hey dont waste your time on this (if you are ), i'll ask blackburn or sonney2k for this
 n4nd0	there is no problem
 n4nd0	but I don't really understand what is it that you don't understand now :)
 n4nd0	harshit_: what is it that doesn't make sense for you?
 harshit_	If add_to_dense_vec is returning 3 elements i.e  no. of dimensions i.e one of feature vector
 harshit_	then it should be 1 4 7
 harshit_	first datapoint
 n4nd0	your matrix was [1 4 7;2 5 8 ;3 6 9]
 n4nd0	??
 harshit_	yes
 n4nd0	your ; is a row delimiter right?
 n4nd0	I mean
 n4nd0	1 4 7
 n4nd0	2 5 8
 harshit_	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	the first point is 1 2 3
 harshit_	exactly
 n4nd0	so then?
 harshit_	oh sorry
 harshit_	ohkay
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	got it
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	the key is to remember that they are just arrays
 n4nd0	just a T* (T is float64_t, int32_t or whatever)
 harshit_	i was confusing coz i thought 1 4 7 as my first datapoint always
 n4nd0	ok
 harshit_	thanks
 n4nd0	you're welcome

@sonney2k	gsomix, I wanted to comment on your patch:
 gsomix	I'm listening.
@sonney2k	python3's integers are long?
@sonney2k	and python3's strings are always unicode?
@sonney2k	and python3 supports some kind of bytestrings that are mutable?
@sonney2k	if so we should for strings use these mutable byte based strings
@sonney2k	(at least in the future support it)
@sonney2k	blackburn, hi hi
 blackburn	sonney2k: heyaa
 gsomix	sonney2k, integers are long. And strings are unicode, but there is old-style strings - PyBytes.
@sonney2k	gsomix, are these PyBytes deprecated or the new mutable string type?
 blackburn	oh that is so funny they call everything with py- suffix
 blackburn	pytoilet
@sonney2k	blackburn, 8 proposals by now...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am happy they do - C has no namespaces...
@sonney2k	and actually namespaces are crank ...
@sonney2k	when a project doesn't use them one is screwed
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah that's ok but every library has this py-*
 blackburn	I said suffix? :D
 blackburn	prefix probably lol
@sonney2k	SG*crap
 gsomix	sonney2k, new. PyBytes has just replaced PyString.
 blackburn	sonney2k: I heard you like proposals so n4ndo put a proposal into your melange
@sonney2k	gsomix, so is PyBytes immutable or mutable?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I know
 blackburn	I am in mood to joke - again damn
 blackburn	sonney2k: so what about C4.5 girl?
 gsomix	sonney2k, immutable.
@sonney2k	I don't know - the google code project is very new (didn't exist a few days ago)
@sonney2k	and we have to see how it goes to integrate that stuff in shogun / compare with j45 from weka
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually we really need to know # of slots..
 gsomix	sonney2k, hmm. wait.
 gsomix	sonney2k, yes, bytes is immutable. I'm confused by old documents.

@sonney2k	gsomix, so b'string' is a byte string
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
@sonney2k	and 'string' is a normal string right?
 gsomix	unicode
 blackburn	no more u'stuff'?
 blackburn	ugliest part of python for sure
@sonney2k	gsomix, b'string' works in python 2.x too right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah luckily no longer needed in python3
 gsomix	sonney2k, it works. In my python2.7. :)
 gsomix	But type(b'string') returns 'str' in python2.7.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok I guess we have to support both the b'string' variant and the unicode variant (checking that only 0...127 is used) in shogun
@sonney2k	not now but we should keep that in mind
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
 gsomix	I remember it.
 gsomix	sonney2k, can i send changes in examples?
 gsomix	print ' ' -> print(''), and others.

 blackburn	huh
@sonney2k	hi wiking - are you still with us? torturing  alexander with questions?
 wiking	sonney2k: yeye
 wiking	i'm here
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm actually I forgot to CC you probably
 wiking	just got back
 wiking	blackburn: yeah actually we could do an abstract class
 wiking	and that would be the 'minimizer'
 wiking	so that one has to implement (inherit) a class from that one
 wiking	did you mean that in your email?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	better this way
 wiking	ok that's good as well
 wiking	more c++ like
 wiking	i can change now the api in 10 mins
@sonney2k	gsomix, difficult to say
 wiking	any other comments?
 wiking	blackburn: the LatentLabel would actually contain two parts
 blackburn	wiking: well only ones I have listed
 wiking	y (the usual labeling) and h and that can be 'anyting'
 wiking	that is the latent variable
 wiking	and how you interpret that
 wiking	it's really up to your application
@sonney2k	gsomix, quite a couple are not working but it needs probably quite some work to figure out why ...
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i did a first api attempt for the latent svm.... do you want to be in the flow of emails?
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, i will think about it.
@sonney2k	wiking, I would even prefer if you do this discussion in public on the mailinglist
 wiking	sonney2k: actually why haven't we started there i have no idea :))))
 wiking	i second this idea as well :P
 gsomix	sonney2k, while I will solve the problems in the covertree.
 blackburn	sonney2k: wiking: hmm could be considered unfair
 wiking	the only thing is that i have a fierce competition ... :)
 wiking	somebody else wants as well to do the latent svm
 wiking	i've just seen a week ago on the mailing list
 blackburn	it would look like we already chose wiking
 wiking	but then again i do all my implementation public
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	last year a couple of people started doing some project
 wiking	so that could be taken an improved by anybody...
@sonney2k	some we took some we didn't take
@sonney2k	and we even merged most patches
 blackburn	wiking: sonney2k: ok then it should be in the way 'how would I do it if I was accepted' :D
@sonney2k	if someone wants to do a project - why should he waste time submitting patches he is not really interested in
@sonney2k	so he could start directly with the project and send patches for that
@sonney2k	e.g. harshit is doing newtonsvm for some time now
 wiking	sonney2k: i would send patches... just simply referring to my fork's branch....
 wiking	;)
@sonney2k	pull requests whatever
 wiking	hihi yeah sure... anyhow then i'll send the next email about it on the mailing list
 blackburn	wiking: yeah just make work in progress request
 blackburn	all the discussion could be there
@sonney2k	last year we had people working on shogun i/o stuff, sgd-qn, java interface already before gsoc started
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I forgot
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have no idea what you did?

 blackburn	sonney2k: well do you think it is ok to resubmit in say may?
@sonney2k	currently I expect the objects to be exactly the same
 blackburn	is there any time limit for that?
@sonney2k	I am not aware of a limit
 blackburn	I can't promise I implement all the tests even in april
@sonney2k	that makes sense if you test on the same machine with no difference in anything (numerical libraries, compiler, ...)
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	but for e.g. svm just using atlas will make the tests fail
@sonney2k	and the solution will only be within 1e-3 or whatever svm eps is
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be test should contain required precision
@sonney2k	problem is I often introduced problems that were like 1e-10 off somewhere but results should have been *exactly* the same
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but this can hide problems too
@sonney2k	maybe we should generate these test data on the buildbot
 blackburn	sonney2k: one reason why I didn't implement such test is it is really easy to check graphically

 gsomix	I always have problems with git repository. =___=
@sonney2k	what do you  want to do?
@sonney2k	e.g. to drop your changes you could do git checkout -f src/shogun/base/Parameter.cpp
@sonney2k	and then the pull
 gsomix	sonney2k, I just want to get the latest changes.
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah but you changed sth in files someone else changed so now you have a conflict
@sonney2k	question is what you want now
@sonney2k	get their version or keep yours
@sonney2k	or manually resolve changes
@sonney2k	for example you can specify git pull -s STRATEGY
@sonney2k	where STRATEGY is their or our
@sonney2k	theirs / ours
@sonney2k	so the remote / your version will be used
@sonney2k	or you edit the files to resolve the conflict
@sonney2k	and then do git add FILE_WITH_CONFLICT
@sonney2k	and git commit when done
 gsomix	sonney2k, but, I did not change these files.
 gsomix	Hmm.
