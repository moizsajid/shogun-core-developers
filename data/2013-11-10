 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix a bug in structure_factor_graph_model.py
@sonney2k	wiking, seen my question about analytics?
@sonney2k	wiking, how do you do it for cloud* are the notebooks then also tracked by that?
@sonney2k	wiking, if not then no wonder the login takes just a few secs
@sonney2k	hushell, and thanks for the quick fix
 hushell	sonney2k: it's my job :) I hope I have more time with Shogun
 hushell	sonney2k: I'll have holidays at December. I'll use this time to add more things
 hushell	Are you guys going to NIPS? It would be a wonderful time to meet together
@wiking	sonney2k: well the notebooks are obviously not having the analytics code... as i dont see an easy way to add that into the ipynb. but the notebooks are opened in a new tab/window hence the login window should be open for a looong while (with the list of possible notebooks)

@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i saw and i've corrected some minor things
@wiking	oh man shogun is totaly broken with 10.9 osx (i.e. llvm 3.3
@sonney2k	wiking, I have it running on maverick...
@sonney2k	what is the issue?
@wiking	sonney2k: it's because you are compiling with cxx11 support i.e. w/o any modular interface
@wiking	and there's an error in swig generated cxx :<
@wiking	so that we wont be able to fix : )

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix libc++ compilation problems
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: aka fixes for OSX 10.9
@wiking	some of the fixes... although this does not fix at all yet the problem with modular interfaces under 10.9
@sonney2k	wiking, we need some plan also for the nightly_default and notebook generation
@sonney2k	wiking, seems like permissions are kaboom for some moment of time and people then visiting the website get some kaboom
