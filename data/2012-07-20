@sonney2k	gsomix, nice!
 gsomix	^^
@sonney2k	wiking, I think adding -L/usr/local/lib/gcc46 to linker flags could also solve it?
 wiking	sonney2k: i'll try to fix it... that flag i've told u fixes this problem...
@sonney2k	wiking, if not then set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 wiking	sonney2k: good question... maybe when compiling the examples codes...
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, nite then :)
 wiking	sonney2k: i'll check how's this handled usually in bigger projects, when u supply the non-standard compiler
 wiking	sonney2k: the problem is the linking part of the code and afaik LD_LIBRARY_PATH won't help in that case
@sonney2k	well rpath is a bad hack
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@37.61.181.69] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
@sonney2k	so linking against the right libstd* can be done with -L/path/to/it
@sonney2k	and then when *running* examples one has to make sure that this lib can be found via LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@sonney2k	blackburn, why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: can least squares be QP?
 blackburn	I am going crazy - what I do looks mathlegal but it is not
 blackburn	sonney2k: with given y is problem min_x (x-y)(x-y)' ~ of  problem min_x x*x' - 2*x*y'?
@sonney2k	yes x*y'
 blackburn	did you discard 2?
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	so it is ok to solve least squares using QP?
@sonney2k	just the x*y typo
@sonney2k	sure why not?
 blackburn	just asking because before I tried to solve problem using v = x-y
 blackburn	it was wrong
 blackburn	well mainly because of s.t. part, it was 0<x<1 and -y<v<1-y is wrong
 blackburn	thanks
@sonney2k	droopy, please sing some good night song for me!
 droopy	sonney2k!
@sonney2k	droopy, sing!
 droopy	obwohl das kann anagram ja auch nicht!
 blackburn	hmm interesting
@sonney2k	droopy, nite!
 blackburn	sonney2k: in libqp_gsmo constraint a'x = b is not used at ALL
 droopy	sonney2k:why to reduce dim anyway?
 blackburn	how can that work damn
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	sounds like a bug...
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	anyway bed time for me
 blackburn	nite
@sonney2k	cu
 droopy	ciao
 blackburn	droopy: AKFA
 droopy	wait
 blackburn	droopy: AKFA
 droopy	blackburn: if we need to buy things, i shift it to someone else
 droopy	*oink*
 blackburn	droopy: shift it to someone else?
 droopy	what i am saying is that someone residing on your network attacked one of my boxes!
 blackburn	I am curious whether one can read log msg by msg

 yoo	heiko: As I said, with n_fold values >2 the bug appear
 heiko	ok I will do that, give me a second
 heiko	ok I get a segfault
 heiko	yoo, ok thats probably my code
 heiko	I still owe a test
 yoo	heiko: another thing I have notice (but thats not a big deal) is when declaring a crossvalidation object: you can apparently call the constructor without passing the features in arguments, and then you get another seg fault
 yoo	when calling evaluate
 yoo	even if the kernel is already init with the right features

 wiking	deadbeef
 blackburn	heiko: argh why didn't you include shogun list
 heiko	blackburn, there you go! :)
 droopy	*g*
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	droopy: yoyoyo wazza
 blackburn	wiking: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2858
 droopy	wiking: you know - the one i was making - 2d top down space simulator/arcade
 wiking	droopy: yeah i remember
 droopy	in that case 4 should be ok!
 wiking	blackburn: :DDDD i've seen the batman
 wiking	chuck norris FTW
 wiking	heiko: so what's your idea with the unit testing?
 heiko	wiking, I would like to have some kind of tests
 heiko	and I would like to make it madatory for every patch that adds/changes code, to add a test which covers that code
 wiking	heiko: can u maybe create a new branch in shogun?
 heiko	with defined input/outpu
 wiking	heiko: so that we can start adding some stuff
 heiko	first we have to discuss a framework etc ..
 wiking	heiko: and when it's stable we merge it into the master
 heiko	yes.
 wiking	heiko: yeah well i think the best way to test pudding is to taste it
 heiko	tests should include memory leaks btw
 heiko	currently its horrible
 heiko	so many leaks
 heiko	and nobody knows where these come from
 wiking	heiko: so that just start doing it and then we'll see what FW we end up using
 heiko	also one should only be allowed to commit if code is mem-clean and has tests
 heiko	Id like to discuss with soeren
 wiking	heiko: i'm totally up for going with goog's framework
 heiko	I like this google test thing
 heiko	but its bsd
 wiking	sonney2k: ping
 wiking	heiko: i've commited bsd code within shogun
 heiko	really?
 wiking	heiko: yep
 wiking	heiko: that's homogeneous kernel map
 wiking	heiko: that's a bsd code based implemenation
 heiko	is it allowed to re-distirbute under gpl?
 heiko	ok
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	well
 wiking	heiko: i've just done the shogun wrappers for it
 heiko	then it might be fine ...I will try to catch up with soren later today
 wiking	heiko: in a way gpl3 superseeds bsd license
 heiko	we also need to discuss how to do it etc
 wiking	heiko: so bsd license basically allows you almost anything...
 heiko	and also development would be slowed down
 heiko	wiking, yes, but it doesnt ensure that program is re-distributed freely
 heiko	only gpl does that
 wiking	heiko: yes.. so?
 heiko	matter of taste
 heiko	I had something in mind that soeren didnt like that
 heiko	but anyway, ill discuss
 wiking	heiko: i mean anyhow u just will depend on an FW that is BSD licensed
 wiking	heiko: you'll not add it into the project
 heiko	wiking, good point
 wiking	heiko: and other libs in shogun deps are bsd licensed
 wiking	for sure

 koen-shogun	wiking: I've missed the whole discussion, but it is my understanding that the gcc compiler will always use the version of libstc it was compiled against itself... so are you using gcc-4.6?

 wiking	koen-shogun: in my case it doesn not
 wiking	koen-shogun: it links against a libstdc that is for another gcc
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@109.226.92.17] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 koen-shogun	hmmm... and I guess the old libstc is the system one?
 wiking	koen-shogun: yeps
 koen-shogun	what if you explicitly pass the path to the libstc at linktime: -l/usr/local/lib/gcc46/listdc.so ? or does that only work when one does static linking (to .a)? and static linking is impossible with libstdc
 wiking	koen-shogun: i'm dynamic linking

 koen-shogun	a question I have myself: right now I cannot pass custom defines for the shogun compilation process
 koen-shogun	because of the line
 koen-shogun	DEFINES=" -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=shogun -DSHOGUN"
 koen-shogun	in configure, the DEFINES environment variable will be overwritten. Does it make sense to replace the line with:
 koen-shogun	DEFINES+=" -DSWIG_TYPE_TABLE=shogun -DSHOGUN"
 koen-shogun	Because then I can do:
 koen-shogun	DEFINES="-D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS" ./configure
 koen-shogun	and my custom define will be used during compilation
 shogun-buildbot	build #181 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/181
 yoo	heiko: hi again. ok I can retrieve results I had with my home made xvalidation.
 yoo	heiko: great
 yoo	heiko: CModelSelectionOutput is of course not working when passing it into cross->evaluate method
 yoo	heiko: should be a warning message also before the crash :p
 yoo	heiko: Maybe I will now focus on ways to improve the results of multiclass machine (should be working with xval too) : something like EER would be nice
 yoo	heiko: see you
 wiking	sonney2k: i think i've managed to solve the problem
 shogun-buildbot	build #156 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/156

 wiking	sonney2k: ok so now it should be able to work
 wiking	if you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc46
 wiking	when you do the gmake of that bot
 wiking	so imo you should do LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc46 gmake instead of simple gmake on that bot
 wiking	and then the libshogun examples should work
 wiking	but ok i'll check now with the new checked out code
@sonney2k	wiking, please try - if it works we change the bot
 wiking	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, PR in progress?
 wiking	sonney2k: the bot is now working
 wiking	sonney2k: so as soon as it finishes i'll try
 wiking	sonney2k: but i've tried that patch on the machine and worked
 wiking	so "it should work"

 wiking	-rwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel    57270 20 Jul 14:35 ccache-swig2.0
 wiking	-rwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel  1547395 20 Jul 14:35 swig2.0
@sonney2k	wiking, symlink to swig missing?
 wiking	sonney2k: noup
@sonney2k	gsomix, any chance for a PR today?
 wiking	sonney2k: afaik this is intentional by the freebsd people
 wiking	sonney2k: i can make a symlink as doing an automated dectection for swig* is just stupid
@sonney2k	great job!
 wiking	sonney2k: or maybe just add a configure flag that sets the swig binary name?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
