 besser82	sonne|osx: Hey!
@sonney2k	ho
 besser82	sonne|osx: Starting with all da left cmake-work  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, you can do it :D
 besser82	sonne|osx: I hope so  :-P
 besser82	sonne|osx: you left da ~ 20 `o`s in da `do`  ;)
 besser82	sonne|osx: btw. some pre-info for you:  octave-3.8.0  will possibly break octave-shogun, because of api49+  && swig-incompats  :(
@sonney2k	meh
 besser82	sonne|osx: just happened on RawHide  :(
 besser82	sonne|osx: and now I'm waiting for those guys to get that fixed before FC21 branch-off...
 besser82	sonne|osx: which will happend ~ 2nd half of Jan
 besser82	sonne|osx: so we can see, if we need to make some changes for new octave api....
 besser82	sonne|osx: currently builds are failing because of cli-incompat octave-config && swig-incompat....
 besser82	sonne|osx: we'll see...
 besser82	sonne|osx: who wrote da R-interface, btw?
 sonne|osx	fabio and me
 besser82	sonne|osx: Which will break with R >= 3.0.0...
 besser82	sonne|osx: where can I catch this `fabio`???
 sonne|osx	besser82: well I know most about it
 sonne|osx	like about all the other interfaces...
 besser82	sonne|osx: hehe
 besser82	sonne|osx: but when i showed you what and why, you didn't haveany clue what happened....
 besser82	sonne|osx: you remember?  Those type-conflicts during run-time?!?
 sonne|osx	besser82: it just depends on how hard I try :D
 sonne|osx	no
 sonne|osx	don't remember...
 besser82	sonne|osx: when i'm ready with da cmake, I'll show you how and what  ;)
 besser82	sonne|osx: same with da Java-interface, which doesn't compile with openJDK  :(
@sonney2k	besser82, compiles here ...
 besser82	sonne|osx: on openJDK?!?
 sonne|osx	besser82: sure
 sonne|osx	you need to set JAVA_HOME to the proper path for it to work
 besser82	sonne|osx:  for me it errors during build, but that might be a glitch im old cmake
 besser82	sonne|osx:  then I'll go and fixit there ;)
 sonne|osx	yeah cmake non-autodetection issue
 besser82	sonne|osx:  nope, other reason  ;)
 besser82	sonne|osx:  or did you patch sth?
 besser82	sonne|osx:  i mean for da debian?!?
 sonne|osx	besser82: remember no interfaces yet in debian - waiting for your out of tree build support
 besser82	sonne|osx:  :-P
 besser82	sonne|osx:  on the build-bots there is SunJDK  :(
 besser82	sonne|osx:  like da wiking told me
 besser82	sonne|osx:  so on "pure" FOSS debian you might come into that problem as well....
@sonney2k	besser82, no it works
 besser82	sonne|osx:  w/o changes?!?
 sonne|osx	woudl say so
 besser82	sonne|osx:  damn...
 sonne|osx	but show me an error ...
 besser82	sonne|osx:  error was like cannot find classpath for ${shogun_build_stuff} during build...
 besser82	sonne|osx: running mock-build to reproduce that...  just a few minutes....

 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|osx:  ^^^^
 besser82	sonney2k, sonne|osx:  looks like my javac has some problems with glob?!?  :(
 sonne|osx	besser82: hmmh then we just fix it by giving it all the *.java ' s manually ?
 besser82	sonne|osx: might be a solution, but it looks like they are passed by sth. like a manifest
 besser82	sonne|osx: so I may need to make that manifest creation a bit moreelaborated...
 sonne|osx	besser82: have to go out with kids now
 besser82	sonne|osx: kk, have much fun  ;)
 sonne|osx	stupid build.xml maybe but should be rather simple to fix then
 sonne|osx	besser82: so what's the state?
 besser82	sonne|osx: checklist / todos are getting smaller  :D
