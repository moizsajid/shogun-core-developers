 lambday	HeikoS: there??
@HeikoS	lambday:  hi
 lambday	HeikoS: hey!
 lambday	HeikoS: just upgraded my RAM and did the benchmark with vectorized Eigen3 sum calls
 lambday	HeikoS: sent a PR - results are remarkable
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
@HeikoS	checking
 lambday	HeikoS: according to this - we should definitely override these sum methods in CCustomKernel
@HeikoS	lambday: I see
@HeikoS	lambday: how does it do the magic?
 lambday	HeikoS: I'm not sure! Eigen3 says its operations are vectorized
 lambday	so that could be it
 lambday	HeikoS: compiled the benchmark with " g++ -std=c++0x -O3 -fopenmp benchmark.cpp -I/usr/include/eigen3 -lshogun"

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added kernel matrix sum benchmark - CKernel::kernel calls vs Eigen3::sum

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added kernel matrix sum benchmark - CKernel::kernel calls vs Eigen3::sum
@HeikoS	lambday: I see, so thats vector operations on hardware level
 lambday	HeikoS: yep!
@HeikoS	lambday: super cool
 lambday	yooo!
@HeikoS	lambday: ah man, we need linear algebra framework to be working
@HeikoS	lambday: can you push that a bit?
 lambday	HeikoS: sunil is having exams
@HeikoS	at least for basic things such as summing up matrix values, factorisations etc
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	ah I mean ok, it will come :)
 lambday	HeikoS: khaled wanted to work on that CPU/GPU stuff
@HeikoS	lambday: in the mean time, feel free to override the CCusotmKernel things
@HeikoS	lambday: but could you already put summing over matrices in the linear algebra backend?
@HeikoS	so that the stuff you are adding there is available for others
 lambday	HeikoS: he wanted to replace current SGVector with GPUVector instead - although I don't think that its a good diea
@HeikoS	lambday: should be straight forward not?
 lambday	HeikoS: absolutely
@HeikoS	lambday: no, no replacement
 lambday	HeikoS: umm do we need summing in the linear algebra backend?
@HeikoS	lambday: why not?
@HeikoS	lambday: why should it rely on eigen?
 lambday	umm yeah it would be cool!
 lambday	yeah you're right
@HeikoS	lambday: if we change the linalg lib then we have to change everything again
@HeikoS	that should not be the case
 lambday	seeing how it performs with GPU would be actually interesting
@HeikoS	would in fact like to get rid of most eigen3 calls in algorithms and rather call shogun classes that do the eigen3 stuff inside (or any other lib)
@HeikoS	lambday: I gotta go now, out for a hiking trip
@HeikoS	so see you later today
 lambday	HeikoS: yo man! have fun! :D
 lambday	HeikoS: see you!
 lambday	I'll send a PR with overridden CCustomKernel calls soon and then start the backend stuff
@HeikoS	cool!

 khalednasr	lambday, I didn't  want to replace SGVector, I meant handling both GPU and CPU memory inside SGVector
 lambday	khalednasr: ah sorry man I didn't get you completely
 lambday	wanted to talk to you regarding this
 lambday	khalednasr: what's wrong with having 2 different classes for 2 different implementations?
 khalednasr	If you have an algorithm that can run on both cpu or gpu, you'd have to have instances of both SGVector and GPUVector for every vector you have
 lambday	khalednasr: we can always manage that using templates, right?
 khalednasr	possible, but it might be complicated if you wanted more control on what data is stored on the gpu and what data is stored on the gpu
 lambday	khalednasr: I am not getting the problem properly - may be we can discuss this in more details when heiko is here?
 shogun-buildbot_	build #624 of FCRH - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FCRH%20-%20libshogun/builds/624
 khalednasr	lambday, yeah sure
 lambday	khalednasr: but if you think that its problematic for some specific instance, could you please post an example on that thread? it would be really helpful
 khalednasr	lambday, ok, I'll see what I can do
 lambday	khalednasr: thanks man!
 lambday	:)

 thoralf	Hey abinash_panda
 abinash_panda	thoralf:So finally my exams are over :)
 abinash_panda	thoralf:I can now devote my full time for shogun
 thoralf	abinash_panda: That's great :)
 thoralf	abinash_panda: I guess you already have ideas on this, right?
 abinash_panda	thoralf: You mean ideas regarding my project, right?
 thoralf	Yes.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Yeah, I have been going through various papers and tutorials
 abinash_panda	thoralf: There is an implementation of multi-label learning in scikit-learn. I was playing with it to get an idea

 jd_tx	hi, I'm using LibSVM through the python swig interface. I've trained a classifier, and I'd like to now get margins(decision values) for my task. apply() only returns the hard +1/-1 outputs. How can I access the decision values?

 thor|alf	abinash_panda: I played with scikit-learn's multilabel stuff as well, but back then it implemented intractable methods like label-combination.
 thor|alf	abinash_panda: I checked and it changed a bit...
