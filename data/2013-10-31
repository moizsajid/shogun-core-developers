@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, I mean we can even write a whole book kind of thing with these notebooks and nicely render that on the website
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: yes sure
@sonney2k	like with code and examples and everything
@sonney2k	and it is tested
@sonney2k	it is like heaven
@sonney2k	too bad we fucked up the cloud thing
@sonney2k	30 users for a DDoS is not really DD
 lisitsyn1	hacker's dream
@sonney2k	anyway now with timeouts stuff should be better
 lisitsyn1	you don't need to waste money on a botnet if you can ddos with 30 nodes :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, even one node with 30 accounts
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, at least 15 people did login via github :)
@sonney2k	but it was a waste to ping 100k people for the cloud thing :)
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun_(toolbox) just updated wiki
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, is article is soo damn outdated
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: yes needs to be rewritten as a part of possible SEO effort :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, *lol*
@sonney2k	we just leave it to rot
@sonney2k	wiking, I lost the key for this google cloud thing :/
@sonney2k	wiking, asking again on the mailinglist - maybe somebody posts it
 lisitsyn1	sonney2k: my new idea
 lisitsyn1	everybody should talk about shogun
 lisitsyn1	:D
 lisitsyn1	well one way is to become a terrorist group and do some explosions
 lisitsyn1	but I prefer something more civil
 lisitsyn1	schlafen!
 besser82	lisitsyn1: Gute Nacht  :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, good idea to cure you from madness too!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn1, schnarche gut!
 besser82	sonney2k: with scrubbed sources one unittest fails  :(
 besser82	sonney2k: 324 - unit-IsomapTest (Failed) ---> http://ur1.ca/fynbp
@sonney2k	besser82, isomap should be totally unrelated
@sonney2k	dammed
 besser82	sonney2k: but it's easily reproducible
 besser82	sonney2k: on unmodded tarball it passes
 besser82	sonney2k: everytime
 besser82	sonney2k: but it actually fails everytime on scrubbed sources
 besser82	sonney2k: time for me to push that SVMbright to a ready to use state
 besser82	sonney2k: within this week
 besser82	sonney2k: Gute Nacht  :)
@sonney2k	night

@wiking	:D
@wiking	kicking out
@lisitsyn	wiking: I keep forgetting to turn down irc
@wiking	sonney2k: ok problem solved
@wiking	sonney2k: notebookserver/[NOTEBOOKNAME] does the notebook opening
@wiking	this needs only now a little bit a js hacking
@wiking	mmm maaaybe we should change something on this site
@wiking	as i see that people keep logging in
@wiking	but they dont really do anything
@wiking	should we open instead of the about tab
@wiking	the ipython notebook tab by default
@wiking	imho yes
 besser82	Morning Folks! :D
 besser82	sonne|work: Is there any news on funding SHOGUN-support e.V. ????
 sonne|work	besser82: HeikoS' duty - looks like we need to kick him hard :D
 sonne|work	wiking: yes!
 besser82	sonne|work: Let's dooooo it!  :-P  I want to donate some $$$  :D
 sonne|work	wiking: actually I am tempted to say we do it the shogun web way: show thumbnails
 besser82	sonne|work: Which would actually be EUREUREUR  ;-P
 sonne|work	wiking: and then clicking on one opens the corresponding notebook
 sonne|work	besser82: we are not picky :D
@wiking	sonne|work: done
@wiking	sonne|work: cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/notebook/FGM.ipynb
 sonne|work	argh my mouse stopped working
@wiking	sonne|work: the only thing is that this does not handle the case
@wiking	sonne|work: not yet logged in
* sonne|work loggs off
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@24-134-74-216-dynip.superkabel.de] has left #shogun []
@wiking	oh this will be fucking interesting... ;)
@wiking	as it's a 2 way auth
@wiking	so i dont know how to save the stupid next url
@wiking	ok it should work now
@wiking	maaybe we should put it in an iframe... but now at least it works

@iglesiasg	good morning!
@wiking	iglesiasg: test it
@wiking	iglesiasg: cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/notebook/LMNN.ipynb
@wiking	but imho somehow we should solve it that the notebook server is actually via a proxy pass
@wiking	and not publicly available...
@wiking	i mean directly ;P
@wiking	iglesiasg: redirection works nicely? it opened u the notebook?
@iglesiasg	wiking, aaah yeah sure
@iglesiasg	wiking, I was running the whole notebook :D
@iglesiasg	I thought there was a problem or something
@wiking	hehe yeah let see
@wiking	nooo
@wiking	i just wanted to see if u get the notebook opened
@wiking	cool
@iglesiasg	wiking, the redirection worked good yes, pasted that linked, logged in and then directly to the notebook
@wiking	cool
@wiking	i've change the default page after login
@iglesiasg	the notebook runs perfectly too btw haha
@wiking	to the notebook tab
@wiking	note the about
@wiking	*not the about
@wiking	as from the stats i see
@wiking	that people log in
@wiking	and then that's ti
@wiking	*it
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@24-134-74-216-dynip.superkabel.de] has joined #shogun
@wiking	they dont do anything
@iglesiasg	face palm...
@wiking	so maybe if they see the list of the notebooks
@wiking	they get it better :P
@iglesiasg	but it might be also that it is just us when we have logged in?
@wiking	sonne|work: done. iglesiasg tested it and worked for him as well
@wiking	iglesiasg: what do u mean?
@iglesiasg	I mean, I have logged in a couple of times and just logged out directly to test everything was fine there
@wiking	:D
@wiking	naaah
@wiking	i haven't seen python running
@wiking	at all :D
@iglesiasg	ok
@wiking	ipython server starts
@wiking	and they idle there :)
@wiking	and then after 60 mins the session is closed :P
@wiking	sonne|work: so basically u can add a link on webpage for 'open in shogun cloud' for the notebooks ;p
@iglesiasg	wiking, anyone so far who have done anything?
 sonne|work	wiking: I did already but not with the proper url
@wiking	sonne|work: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/notebook/<notebookname.ipynb>
 sonne|work	wiking: because I thought you don't get this to work :P
 sonne|work	wiking: just try how it is now
 sonne|work	all the rest is trivial to add
@wiking	ah i see :P
@wiking	yeah just need to ad the right link for that Try in cloud
 sonne|work	wiking: will do it today
@wiking	cool
 sonne|work	wiking: and login works now too?
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean people have to login first
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah if they are not logged in they'll be redirected to login and after successful login they'll be redirected to the notebook

 sonne|work	wiking: excellent!
 besser82	HeikoS: Any news about founding SHOGUN-support e.V.?  I want to donate the EUREUREUR  :-P
@iglesiasg	wiking, remember to send me your workshop slides if that is not a problem ;)
@lisitsyn	besser82: want to donate? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes  :D  But to make it tax-reducting I need to donate to some e.V., Foudation or similar  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: So I was asking HeikoS how this stage is grown....
@wiking	iglesiasg: ohshityeahsorry will asap
@iglesiasg	wiking, :D thanks!
@wiking	yeah let's make that e.V. or register it elsewhere if it's too complicated
@wiking	i mean it does not really matter which country the fundation really resides...
@lisitsyn	besser82: give it to me I'll take care :D
 besser82	wiking: founding some e.V. actually is really easy, just time consuming...
 sonne|work	wiking: it is more that you have to write some 'hey we are a non profit and that are our goals'
 sonne|work	wiking: the rest is only me taking this thing to some notar/agency here
 besser82	wiking: you will just need ~5 founding members and some time for doing the paper-business...
@wiking	sonne|work: i can make in 1 day here a nonprofit organisation for shogun (just asked about it last week)
@wiking	here i need 3 members
 besser82	wiking: actually the notar should be able to provide the "Satzung" for non-profit
 sonne|work	besser82: we did already - and everyone did sign the draft
 sonne|work	besser82: but HeikoS polished things a bit
 besser82	sonne|work: I see, OK...  but where is it struggling by?
 sonne|work	besser82: well a day has 24hrs and we have real lives
 sonne|work	besser82: in this case HeikoS is just studying too hard ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: Real lives?!? Which server is that?  Never heared of it.  :-P
@lisitsyn	haha
 besser82	sonne|work: Let's keep it serious: So HeikoS just needs some more time for polishing, right?
 sonne|work	besser82: I think he did it even already
 sonne|work	besser82: just some mail to the ML or so is necessary
 besser82	sonne|work: So the real problem is meeting && signing???
 sonne|work	besser82: well we did already meet and sign
 sonne|work	besser82: updates are really minor
@iglesiasg	besser82, we need to carry out a poll or something similar to select a couple of representatives methinks
 besser82	iglesiasg: Representatives for the e.V. / foundation?
@iglesiasg	besser82, yes, I think so
 besser82	iglesiasg: That a real good idea  ;)
@iglesiasg	someone with some responsibilities IIRC
 besser82	iglesiasg: But how would we setup the nomination / voting?
 besser82	iglesiasg: Everybody nominates himself?  Who is eligitable to vote?
 besser82	iglesiasg: What is the min. quorum to be elected?
@iglesiasg	besser82, I am going to set up something similar to doodle but used for voting, we did a test with it
@iglesiasg	besser82, once HeikoS sends me names and mail addresses we collected in Berlin last June
 besser82	iglesiasg: Another good catch  ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, about the quorum, no idea really. And people eligible to vote I guess everyone who signed this Satzung
@iglesiasg	besser82, but I think people who have joined later should be able to participate if they want
 besser82	iglesiasg: I'd propose a quorum with minimal majority wouldbe reasonable. --> voters/2 + 1
 besser82	iglesiasg: Actual members of the e.V. should be able to "steer", I'd agree with you

@wiking	sonne|work: cool
@iglesiasg	Google cloud??
@iglesiasg	What are we going to use it for?
@wiking	u have one guess ;P
@iglesiasg	run Shogun cloud over Google cloud platform I guess :)
@iglesiasg	wiking, but is still for the ipython environment, right?
@wiking	u one a free shogun session :P
@wiking	yeps
@iglesiasg	It is just so that we don't have to worry about the infrastructure
@wiking	well
@wiking	we'll see how we'll maange :P
@wiking	*manage
@iglesiasg	hehe I am reading about Google cloud right now
@iglesiasg	wiking, so the idea is that we won't use fatbot any more to provide the Shogun session
@iglesiasg	or?
@wiking	i would say load balance
@wiking	so still keep the fatbo
@wiking	fatbot
@wiking	but use fatbot's nginx to do some kind of a load balancing between g.cloud + fatbot
@iglesiasg	neat, I like the idea
@iglesiasg	wiking, do we have access to some sort of Google analytics to see how the impact is going?
@iglesiasg	I'd love to check it!
@wiking	iglesiasg: analytics.google.com
@wiking	use shogun-team@
@wiking	it tracks a bit the cloud
@wiking	not all as i didn't integrate the tracking script into the notebooks :P
@iglesiasg	average visit duration 1 min 05?
@iglesiasg	buuh
@iglesiasg	What's up with the people?! hehe

@sonney2k	and shift reload I guess
@sonney2k	well notebook thumbs
@sonney2k	when you click the cloud thing it should open it directly

@sonney2k	wiking, shift reload :P

@sonney2k	(except for having nuts)
 HeikoS	haha :)
 HeikoS	eating nuts? :)
 HeikoS	haha
 HeikoS	yeah I reckoned that
 HeikoS	I was just doing some yoga ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the tiger
 HeikoS	sonney2k: shogun publicity, where is it?
 HeikoS	sonney2k: btw just ordered the new thinkpad
@sonney2k	HeikoS, hehe
 HeikoS	sonney2k: its weird, memory does not increase that much anymore
 HeikoS	had 8gb
 HeikoS	new one has 12gb max option from vendor
@sonney2k	yeah stupid
 HeikoS	but looking forward to the 8threads
 HeikoS	and the battery life ;)
@sonney2k	my macbook air has just 4gb
 HeikoS	I wonder why that is, I want 64GB
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, the thumbs work nice here to open the cloud directly
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, heh :)
@iglesiasg	so nice!
 HeikoS	indeed
 HeikoS	I like the "try cloud"
@iglesiasg	there is something with the demos though, I am not sure if it is expected behaviour
@iglesiasg	so if you open one and press esc it closes it, good
@iglesiasg	but if you do some stuff, say generate some data and train the model
@iglesiasg	and press esc then, the demo does not close
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hmmhh indeed - no idea how to fix that
@iglesiasg	there is something similar for the notebooks too
@sonney2k	and no idea why this is happening in the first place
@iglesiasg	if you click somewhere just for fun, then esc does not do its job
@iglesiasg	if you just scroll though, then it is fine
@iglesiasg	it seems to happen once  the demo or the notebook get the "focus"
@iglesiasg	no idea either, it seems to be sth subtle...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, would make sense - no idea how to register that
@sonney2k	wiking, alright cloud is ordered now we have to wait for our 2k$ startup thing
