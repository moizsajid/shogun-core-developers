 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey, do you have a moment?
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: sure
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I'm thinking about using ViennaCL directly for both CPU and GPU, instead of extending linalg
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hmm you mean instead of this thing lambday works on?
 khalednasr	yeah
 khalednasr	cause it would take too much time to add all the methods I need to the linalg library, and some of them will be too specialized, like: multiply-by-the deriviative-of-the-logistic-function

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, the downside of this is that neuralnets would require viennacl to compile, but it's a header only library so that shouldn't be a big problem
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: we usually try to provide some fallback implementation
 lisitsyn	that would be an issue
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I could try to add a naive implementation in case viennacl wasn't available. The way I'm doing right now with Eigen3
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: hmm well makes sense for now
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: could you please catch up with lambday if you see him online
 lisitsyn	so you can discuss it as well
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, yeah
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: you could start with naive impls before I think
 lisitsyn	does that make sense?
 lisitsyn	they should be easier to debug etc
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, we already have one :)
 lisitsyn	yeah cool
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, the problem is with datatypes, since viennacl needs to use it's own vector/matrix type and not SGVector/SGMatrix
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	that's always an issue
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, do you know if Theo is on the mailing list? I wanna send the weekly report
 lisitsyn	khalednasr: please just CC him
 lisitsyn	that'd be better
 khalednasr	ok

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: notebook is looking nice!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, hey!
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: we could also do some things for missing data maybe .....
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, oh
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: like replace values with mean
 Saurabh7	the pima thng
 Saurabh7	yes nice idea
@HeikoS	We could also ask parjiat to implement an incomplete svd
@HeikoS	then we can do low-rank fill ins of missing values
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: could you suggest him and fernando to do this? with my best regards? Should be easy
@HeikoS	Here is some reference
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/050512.zip

 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes , i will have a look at it in meanwhile
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: also, dont forget the weekly update :)
@HeikoS	you can send a link of the notebook, to get more feedback!
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, i was working on the diagram too
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok will do that
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: cool, any results to show so far?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, but dont know if the unfinished one is good enough
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, i will put a link in the pr

 lambday	re
 lambday	HeikoS: hehe.. shall I mention the linalg stuffs there? I was confused.. :D
 lambday	khalednasr: hey man... sorry took a while... mom was on call :(
@HeikoS	lambday: sure, you worked on that last week right? :)
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah...
 khalednasr	lambday, no problem :)
 lambday	HeikoS: will add vector sum methods this week and on streaming mmd stuffs
 lambday	khalednasr: how's it going? something you wanted to discuss?
 khalednasr	I want to use the linalg library in the neural net stuff
 lambday	khalednasr: great! as of now we have dot products (works with eigen3 and viennacl) and matrix sum methods (works with eigen3)
 lambday	khalednasr: but the problem is... its a feature branch of shogun and still isn't merged with develop
 khalednasr	lambday, yeah I wanted to talk to you about that
 lambday	khalednasr: so in case you use these methods, please send your PR to feature/linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: you think its worth it?
 lambday	HeikoS: vector sums?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
 lambday	HeikoS: doesn't harm, right? I am convinced that its going to be faster
 lambday	HeikoS: plus we already have sums for matrices.... why not for vectors
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, in particular for permutation tests without precomputing kernel matrices
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	agree
 khalednasr	lambday, the thing is, the linalg branch is behind when it comes to the latest neuralnets code
@HeikoS	lambday: whats the state of the feature branch?
 lambday	khalednasr: HeikoS: it works... but I'm not sure whether we should merge this with develop unless we hear from wiking
 lambday	khalednasr: umm... may be its better if this gets merged with develop.. I'm not sure.. that's easier to avoid anomalies
 khalednasr	lambday, until it gets merged, I'm gonna need to add some methods to linalg
 lambday	khalednasr: alright... which ones do you need?
 khalednasr	lambday, I could start with viennacl sums
 khalednasr	then matrix multiplication
 lambday	khalednasr: we gotta figure out which module that method should go in - because we support module wise settings
 lambday	khalednasr: ah great! viennacl sums for matrices?
 khalednasr	lambday, yeah
 lambday	khalednasr: cool man!
 lambday	so redux is the module
 lambday	matrix multiplication... umm.. may be a new util module? or misc? :/
 khalednasr	not sure..
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@host80-223-dynamic.246-95-r.retail.telecomitalia.it] has joined #shogun
 lambday	khalednasr: the code there is a bit tricky - but super flexible - we can directly pass SGVectors/Eigen3-vectors/viennacl-vectors in the same methods and it handles it all from within
 khalednasr	it's an important method in a linear algebra library so it probably shouldn't be in a misc. module :)
 lambday	haha... agree!
 khalednasr	yeah the code is great :)
 lambday	may be we can steal some ideas from eigen3.. watching which module do they put matrix multiplication in
 lambday	khalednasr: :)
 lambday	khalednasr: also, please notice how things are done in dot product - its totally possible to pass an eigen3 vector to dot method but internally it uses viennacl
 lambday	things should be similar for sums...
 lambday	truly backend independent is the goal here
 khalednasr	yeah I'll keep that in mind
@HeikoS	lambday: we should definitely not wait for too long with this
@HeikoS	lambday: about the feedback you got from him, did you adress all the issue he pointed out? with cmake etc?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. if khalednasr is on board, this would be finished within one week
@HeikoS	lambday: well thats good
@HeikoS	lambday: did you hear from yorkerlin?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes.. but didn't hear from him afterwards
 lambday	HeikoS: no for yorkerlin

 lambday	HeikoS: I asked for besser82's help on cmake stuffs... but.. umm.. may be he forgot :P
 lambday	besser82: there man?
 lambday	HeikoS: what do you feel about merging this with develop?
 lambday	HeikoS: I mean, which other functionalities would be there before it makes it to develop?
 lambday	by next week, sum and dot would be ready I hope
@HeikoS	lambday: if we merge, it has to be clear that the build not is not broken and that we dont get stuck with this
@HeikoS	but that seems fine
@HeikoS	lambday: so I think we should do soon
@HeikoS	wiking: any thoughts?
 lambday	HeikoS: hmm... I am worried about cmake stuffs..
@HeikoS	lambday: the implemented methods do not need to be super complete (just some factorisations maybe)
@HeikoS	lambday: but the cmake stuff (in particular if we add viennacl) needs to be waterproof
@HeikoS	lambday: we need another build on the bot then too
 lambday	HeikoS: it detects viennacl perfectly on my machine...
@HeikoS	lambday: thats good
 lambday	but not sure if its gonna work for other archs
 lambday	say bsd or debian
 lambday	I use fedora
@HeikoS	lambday: I mean if you keep on putting effort into this, I dont see any problems
@HeikoS	lambday: I suggest you get besser82 to review the cmake things
 lambday	HeikoS: may be yorkerlin can help a bit there with factorization...
@HeikoS	and then we merge, if nobody objects
 lambday	cholesky and stuffs
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
 lambday	HeikoS: I'll push besser82 a bit about this :)
@HeikoS	lambday: cool! :)
 lambday	but factorization is tough to be done within next week on our own :( need yorkerlin on board
@HeikoS	lambday: the only reason to have some more functionality is that it will reveal problems
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, I will push him a bit to get involved there.
 lambday	umm yeah... problems with the framework you mean
@HeikoS	lambday: would you be able to guide him a bit on this?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I'll try my best :)
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, like things that dont work, its good to find them before merging :)

 khalednasr	lambday, I'm also gonna need to add random number generator for the gpu
@besser82	HeikoS, lambday: I'm on it... but I'm currently a bit over occupied with things for my $money_jobs
 lambday	besser82: no worries - whenever you have some free time
 lambday	khalednasr: umm.. that I don't know anything about - but that should not go into linalg I think... right?
 khalednasr	lambday, it's gonna generate random matrices. any suggestions on where to put it?
 lambday	khalednasr: so, you mean... something like Eigen::MatrixBase::Random()
 lambday	khalednasr: umm these can do inside linalg::Util module
 lambday	but if you just need a rng in general,.. maths is the place
 khalednasr	yeah but the generation has to be done the GPU
 khalednasr	to avoid moving tons of data across the PCI bus
@HeikoS	besser82: just leave some basic comments on how things should be done, or give your ok
 lambday	khalednasr: I meant to say, do you think that it can work if you put a rng for GPU in maths and then use that in linalg::Util::generate_random() or something
@HeikoS	lambday, khalednasr see wiking 's rng framework!
@besser82	HeikoS, will do so during tonite

I am having trouble getting the modular interfaces to install - I can't seem to find the right development packages.

 khalednasr	I'm not sure I'll be able to port it to opencl though
 lambday	vlado862: which packages are you missing?
 vlado862	Hi lambday - I am not sure - I just see the cmake output tells me none of the modular interfaces are ON
 khalednasr	lambday, HeikoS I was thinking of doing something like this: http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10/research/rngs-gpu-mwc64x.html
@HeikoS	khalednasr: you should definitely talk to wiking about this!
 lambday	vlado862: you need to explicitly turn those on... like cmake -DPythonModular=ON -RModular=ON .. inside build dir
@HeikoS	khalednasr: and to sergey !g
 lambday	khalednasr: yep! I don't know much about this stuff
 khalednasr	sure, I'll talk to them when I start working on it

 vlado862	lambday: this is the command I ran cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$home_dir/shogun-3.2.0" -DCmdLineStatic=ON -DPythonModular=ON  -DMatlabStatic=ON -DRStatic=ON  ..
 vlado862	lambday: the erro I get is R was not built as a library CMake Error at /inside/home/uzunangelov/cmake-2.8.12/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:108 (message):   Could NOT find R (missing: R_LIBRARIES R_CXX_FLAGS) Call Stack (most recent call first):
 lambday	vlado862: I never installed R myself but be sure that R-dev pkg is intalled
 vlado862	lambday: OK, great, will do. I actually started looking into that, but I don't have root privileges on our server, and the R-dev package has a bunch of dependencies that I basically need to install manually. I was wondering if there is a way I can save myself the grief
 lambday	vlado862: may be you can.. I'm not entirely sure.. may be besser82 and wiking can comment better on this...

 khalednasr	lambday, I'm working on  implementing sum() with ViennaCL, but there might be a problem
 lambday	khalednasr: what problem?
 khalednasr	the base sum struct expects the matrix to be like: template<class,Info...>
 khalednasr	however, ViennaCL matrices are defined like: template <class SCALARTYPE, typename F, unsigned int ALIGNMENT>
 khalednasr	this F is making it fail to compile
 lambday	khalednasr: what's the F here?
 khalednasr	viennacl uses to specify row major or column major format
 lambday	khalednasr: hmm.. I see..

 lambday	umm... may be we have to change that a bit... so... class Other1, class Other2, template<class,Other1...,Other2...> class Matrix, class T.... somethign like that
 lambday	Eigen3 matrix has int... params for their matrix
 lambday	For viennacl vector it was template <class SCALARTYPE, unsigned int SOMETHING> ... now for matrix 2nd arg is problematic
 khalednasr	yeah
 lambday	so we gotta change the base to handle two different types of Info... there...
 lambday	then specializations would take care of the particulars
 khalednasr	alright, I'll give it a try and get back to you
 lambday	khalednasr: sounds good :) let me know if I can help with something :)
 khalednasr	lambday, you're already helping :)

 parijat	iglesiasg: hi!
 parijat	iglesiasg: I'm here finally!! :-)
@iglesiasg	hey parijat!
@iglesiasg	great :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, so I am basically revising the code. I have no good understanding of the theory of the cost-complexity pruning, but I trust you
@iglesiasg	parijat, I see your trees are on lsd :P (L302 of CART impl)
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya, they are indeed
 parijat	iglesiasg: :p
@iglesiasg	parijat, so a couple of things I would like to discuss
 parijat	iglesiasg: sure please go ahead
@iglesiasg	parijat, 1) the unit tests are getting overly large due to the data definition
@iglesiasg	parijat, it is probably not a big deal, but there's maybe a solution?
 parijat	iglesiasg: I agree.. wherever data are same I can use a common method to create data.. but in many cases the data are not exactly same
@iglesiasg	parijat, that's a way of going with it, yes
 parijat	iglesiasg: let me try shotening with that.
@iglesiasg	parijat, don't spend much time with it though, I prefer CART to be finished first
@iglesiasg	parijat, this is something that could be done afterwards once the more important stuff is done
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok ya sure! CART is almost done.. I am finishing things today... probably I will send in PR after this current one is merged
 shogun-buildbot	build #319 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/319  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, lambday <heavensdevil6909@gmail.com>, jiaolong <jiaolongxu@gmail.com>, Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	parijat, I will merge this PR then
@iglesiasg	parijat, well, as soon as you have addressed the current comments
 parijat	iglesiasg: there are a few things in the current PR which I have changed later on to fit the cross validation part...
@iglesiasg	parijat, hmm that doesn't sound good
 parijat	iglesiasg: I can send in a big PR together then and close this..
@iglesiasg	parijat, no please -- this PR is already too large
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya I know :-)
@iglesiasg	parijat, the prune alone first and the missing values afterwards would have been better
@iglesiasg	parijat, focus on addressing the comments, then I will merge
@iglesiasg	remember to write a comment when you update it so I get notified by mail
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok!

 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: lambday: so what's up? :)
 lisitsyn1	what you have decided?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, I'm gonna add some basic methods to linalg and use them in neuralnets
 lisitsyn1	cool
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: lambday convinced you it is good? ;)
 khalednasr	things like matrix multiplication and sums and so on..
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, I thought about it and  I guess it would be better to use the library
 lisitsyn1	yeah maybe
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, I'm gonna use for the main things only, specialized things like logistic and softmax will be just handled in neuralnets
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, what do you think?
 lisitsyn1	khalednasr: I am good with that so far
 lisitsyn1	but lets see PRs
 lisitsyn1	we can refine it later then I guess
 khalednasr	lisitsyn1, cool. I'm working on adding viennacl sums to linalg right now
