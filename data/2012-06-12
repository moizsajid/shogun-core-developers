 n4nd0	nicococo: hallo, how are you?
 nicococo	hi, fine. what about you?
 n4nd0	I am good
 n4nd0	I got a new mosek license :D
 nicococo	very good .. now its working??
 n4nd0	yeah, I can solve "big" problems again
 nicococo	uuuhhh.. and the mc problem is solved therefore
 nicococo	:)
 n4nd0	yeah
 nicococo	fantastic!
 n4nd0	I have yet to checked that the results are reliable enough
 n4nd0	still better than yet :P
 nicococo	ok ;)  i think we then have to talk about the next steps right
 nicococo	i mean the big picture steps
 n4nd0	yeah, we can talk a bit about it right now if you want
 n4nd0	I will have to go in a while though
 nicococo	yes, because i want to go on vacation next month (for about 1 month) and would like to keep you busy ;)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	so hm-svm?
 nicococo	in your application was a timetable that states: hmsvm and crf
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	what do you think we should go for first?
 nicococo	honestly, i don't know how much we can deviate from these goals (i have to ask) but i think the main goal is already achieved and there are a couple of new things.
 n4nd0	I would say hm-svm
 n4nd0	what are these new things?
 n4nd0	the optimizer?
 nicococo	like: coffin, opensource solver
 n4nd0	yes
 nicococo	what are your preferences?
 n4nd0	but I still think that hm-svm is important
 n4nd0	I won't be pleased until we have done that :)
 nicococo	yes, and this will take a long time (can be quite tricky)
 n4nd0	I would say then hm-svm, coffin, solver and crf; in that order
 n4nd0	oh
 nicococo	we can combine it with coffin..
 n4nd0	what are the tricky points with hm-svm?
 nicococo	its a whole bunch of little things that are not exactly hard to solve but not easy either
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	can you tell me a bit more in particular? :)
 n4nd0	or is it better to wait?
 nicococo	okay what do you think about combining hm-svm with coffin??
 n4nd0	while I have more or less an idea how hm-svm would fit in the framework
 n4nd0	I don't have it for coffin
 n4nd0	so I am not sure about the answer
 n4nd0	I understand that hm-svm should derive from CStructuredModel
 nicococo	in my opinion combination with coffin would be 1) a new thing, 2) maybe easier for the task i am thinking of (procaryote gene prediction)
 n4nd0	it may be tricky as you say but I have clear the idea that we "just" need an argmax function, a psi and a delta loss
 nicococo	mmhhh.. sorry.. there is more :)
 n4nd0	tell me
 nicococo	ever heard of plif-functions?
 n4nd0	something about the labels too
 n4nd0	I have seen something around in shogun yes
 n4nd0	but I have no idea what they are
 nicococo	and you also need a state model :)
 n4nd0	?
 nicococo	okay, there are two possible things:
 nicococo	a) the one i told you two minutes ago
 nicococo	b) building the hmsvm matlab framework
 n4nd0	what do you think?
 n4nd0	combination with coffin?
 nicococo	i mean, you already had a look at the hmsvm-code, right? there are 30 files only for hm-svm :) its much more than argmax,delta
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	but the article gave me that idea :S
 nicococo	theory-application gap ;)
 n4nd0	too bad
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	anyhow
 n4nd0	let me know your opinion about each of the two possibilities :)
 nicococo	i would like to go with the coffin-hmsvm..
 n4nd0	I am ok with that
 n4nd0	but tell me why please ;)
 n4nd0	it's not a why meaning that I would like the other
 n4nd0	it's a why to gain understanding :)
 nicococo	it is a new thing.. first step towards real-large scale (high dim) problems in so
 nicococo	and much easier to implement in the basic version :))
 n4nd0	sounds pretty nice to me
 n4nd0	all advantages :D
 n4nd0	do you have any application in mind for it?
 nicococo	yes, i also know some people who can give you a hand when i am on vacation
 nicococo	so, don't worry
 n4nd0	that's great
 nicococo	we code an gene predictor for simple procaryote organism (like bacteria)
 n4nd0	no idea what's that :P
 nicococo	.. with real data
 nicococo	no toy data anymore ;)
 n4nd0	yeah
 nicococo	okay, but first, the toy data mc-experiment
 n4nd0	sure
 nicococo	can you test the coffin thing with that?
 n4nd0	we could do that
 n4nd0	but the coffind thing may take time
 n4nd0	coffin
 nicococo	no prob
 n4nd0	I have to read a bit more about it and probably ask sonney2k
 nicococo	did you already checked in the code for this exp?
 nicococo	experiment
 n4nd0	for the mc example?
 nicococo	yes
 n4nd0	not yet
 n4nd0	but I am able to do it in python now
 n4nd0	sonney2k found the part I was missing
 nicococo	super! (that was my next question)
 nicococo	what was the problem?
 n4nd0	so I will commit the example this evening probably
 n4nd0	we have to include "class CStructuredModel" and the same for CLossFunction in the header of StructuredMachine
 n4nd0	it looks like a workaround for making it work with SWIG
 nicococo	one thing less to worry about
 n4nd0	yes
 nicococo	so, can we meet again on thursday and you put all the stuff in git and try to get coffin working with the example..
 n4nd0	ok, let's do that
 nicococo	its a bit short on time maybe.. but just have a look
 n4nd0	I will do my best :)
 nicococo	;)
 nicococo	ok. then see you on thursday.. don't work too much :)
 n4nd0	haha ok
 n4nd0	bye

 KMcQuisten	Just posted a description of it to the mailing list.
 KMcQuisten	I made a trivial DircetorKernel for testing, provided it to LibSVR, and I get lots of garbage collection and segfault errors
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, how many CPU cores does your machine have?
 KMcQuisten	2
@sonney2k	set number of threads to 1 and try again

@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, did that help?

 KMcQuisten	Shame I can't seem to take advantage of multicore.
 KMcQuisten	Oh well.  at least it works
 KMcQuisten	thanks

 gsomix	hi all
 KMcQuisten	Hey there
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, reason is that python doesn't support threads
@sonney2k	you know the GIL (global interpreter lock...)
@sonney2k	so no way
 gsomix	It seems that all problems have decided on without me. :) Nice.
 KMcQuisten	So the builtins can leverage parallel, but there's no way to make directorkernels work like that?
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, please post the answer to the mailinglist - and give us some hint how we can warn the user ...
@sonney2k	KMcQuisten, yes no way
 KMcQuisten	Hmm.
 KMcQuisten	i wonder if the multiprocessing package could be used to help this.
@sonney2k	no
 KMcQuisten	tried it?
@sonney2k	as I said it is a limitation of python
@sonney2k	at some europython conference I talked to guido the BDL about this ... no way

 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey!
 n4nd0	about wiking and michal's pull requests
 n4nd0	I think it could be a good idea if they use the latest code of the SO framework
 n4nd0	it has changed a bit from the last PR you merged

@sonney2k	they should
@sonney2k	problem really is that when they wait longer they have to merge and merge over and over again with all the changes coming...
 n4nd0	yeah, I understand
