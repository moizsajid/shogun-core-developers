@HeikoS	lambday: yes definitely
@HeikoS	lambday: but also the fact that it is easy to extend linalg
@lambday	the 'custom(...)' thing is a good option for that
@lambday	yeah
@lambday	good that we discussed it man
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	and you smashed it with the prototype
@HeikoS	so cool
@HeikoS	It feels like this is how it should be
@HeikoS	so hopefully we can use this stuff soon
@lambday	hopefully
@lambday	:)
@HeikoS	I think we should aim to put the GP framework on the back of it first
@HeikoS	since it is new, we dont really break compatibility
@HeikoS	(because of c++11)
@HeikoS	so a good test field
@HeikoS	as well as all the NN stuff
@lambday	HeikoS: if I get to work on that a bit, maybe I'll learn a bit of GP :D
@HeikoS	these two should use the linalg first
@HeikoS	if that goes well, we can use it everywhere
@HeikoS	yorkerlin is very keen to put GPs on the GPU
@lambday	yeah.. that sounds good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how's swig?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no idea why it fails again :)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	ok, thats ALL shogun emails answered
@HeikoS	phew
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: thanks a lot for handling this
@HeikoS	we got some good stuff going on with the benchmarks
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I hope that someone joins me at some point
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: btw about the sampling
@HeikoS	think about algorithms in terms of "how good per unit time"
@HeikoS	you can think of a plot
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: mcmc needs quite a lot of iterations in my experience
 lisitsyn	even for simple models
@HeikoS	depends on what you mean by iterations
@HeikoS	 a single mcmc iteration has to touch all data
@HeikoS	that is expensive
@HeikoS	but good samplers converge fast if used correctly
@HeikoS	but anyways
@HeikoS	the point is:
@HeikoS	mcmc gets arbritarily good
@HeikoS	that is if you continue to run it, it gets better
@HeikoS	variational does not
@HeikoS	thats the main difference
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday see you tomorrow!
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	I see
 lisitsyn	see you
@lambday	HeikoS: see you!
@lambday	me too leaving.. it's 4:40 AM here

@lambday	lisitsyn: any idea on how to support namespace structure for class_list ?
 lisitsyn	lambday: haven't checked yt
 lisitsyn	yet
@lambday	hmm me neither
@lambday	this should be a useful thing to support
@lambday	but for interfaces, how this is gonna work?
@lambday	from modshogun import subnamespace - does it work that way?

@HeikoS	lambday: we could maybe have a subfolder for hypothesis testing, rather than statistics
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah that would be good
@HeikoS	lambday: hypothesis_testing
@lambday	HeikoS: but what could be a good name for that? shogun/statistics/hypothesistest is quite a mouthful :/
@HeikoS	rename statistics
@lambday	ah
@lambday	yeah that makes sense
@HeikoS	on the other hand, statistics also contains feature selection code doesnt it?
@lambday	nah that's in preprocessor
@HeikoS	but all these are dependence measure in some or another way
@HeikoS	ah ok
@HeikoS	well then
@HeikoS	rename statistics (pretty useless name anyways ;) )
@lambday	cool
@lambday	HeikoS: cooking dinner now :D will start in a while
@HeikoS	lambday: what are you cooking?
@lambday	btw does arthur follow cricket? he said something regarding the australian cricket team - today aussies are playing against bangladesh
@HeikoS	lambday: eeehm, no idea ;)
@HeikoS	he travels to Japan today so I guess he will just watch zombie movies in the plane
@lambday	HeikoS: spinach - popeye the sailor man
@lambday	hahahaha
@HeikoS	haha :D
@HeikoS	we got some nice south indian places here in London, I am really ucrious how you will like them
@HeikoS	btw, any news on this visa thing, or just waiting for time to pass?
@lambday	HeikoS: hehe I am not a big fan of south indian dishes in general..
@HeikoS	really?, interesting
@lambday	HeikoS: yeah I cc-ed you the conversation I had with reign.. I gotta wait
@lambday	:(
@lambday	no other way
@HeikoS	ok

 sanuj	HeikoS: there?
@HeikoS	sanuj: yes, hi!
 sanuj	HeikoS: hello
 sanuj	HeikoS: we dont need a setter in train method right?
@HeikoS	what do you mean by that?
 sanuj	llt will update the preallocated alpha vector
@HeikoS	sanuj: ah yes, you pass the preallocated vector to the new method, which will update it
 sanuj	HeikoS: like 'eigen_y = llt.solve(eigen_y);'
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	so no need to set alpha again in train
@HeikoS	but dont do the above
@HeikoS	you will overwrite the labels
@HeikoS	eigen_alpha = llt.solve(eigen_y)
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah
 sanuj	i'll take care of it
@HeikoS	cool, looking forward
 sanuj	HeikoS: so the solve_krr_system() will return void
 sanuj	or maybe a bool
@HeikoS	bool is good, yes
 sanuj	cool
@HeikoS	sanuj: point is to make it easy to overload this method
@HeikoS	for the approximate versions
@HeikoS	which are based on a different kernel matri
 sanuj	HeikoS: yes
@lambday	what's ShoGaY
@lambday	whois ShoGaY
@lambday	ShoGaY: hello
 sanuj	lambday: i think it's a bot
 sanuj	not sure
 sanuj	ask wiking
@lambday	I too think so
@lambday	the name is funny haha
 sanuj	:P
@lambday	why your name isn't coming on tab
@lambday	:/
 sanuj	sanuj:
@HeikoS	troll bot ;)
@lambday	san
@lambday	nah no luck
@lambday	haha
@lambday	ShoGaY: commands
@lambday	ShoGaY: dance
@lambday	ShoGaY: boo!
@lambday	useless

@HeikoS	does this work for you?
@HeikoS	shogun-buildbot: boo!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
 sanuj	haha
@lambday	shogun-buildbot: What you say!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@lambday	HeikoS: was the link for me or sanuj
@lambday	bangladesh making the aussies fight! some sight to behold!
@HeikoS	lambday: github was down for a second
@HeikoS	but now its back up
@lambday	oh
@HeikoS	so forget about the link
 sanuj	HeikoS: is that for your phd
@HeikoS	sanuj: kind of yes
@HeikoS	crappy python code is what you do in phds ;)
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	is it about to get over?
