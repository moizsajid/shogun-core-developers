@sonney2k	wiking, hey there!
@sonney2k	foulwall`, neat! so the whole machinery beneath is already working?
@wiking	sonney2k: can we fix buildbot nightly? :)
@sonney2k	foulwall`, just the centering / extracting the region is missing and I guess you should also load the model just once for this demo if it takes too long
@sonney2k	wiking, what's wrong with it?
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean to generate the .tar.gz of the binaries?
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-399972.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	wiking, we just need a make target for that and then we can do it
@wiking	ok
@sonney2k	wiking, did sergey come to the 3nd workshop day btw?
@wiking	btw are we doing this for the r_modular: PKG_LIBS="example.cxx" R CMD SHLIB -o example example_wrap.cpp
@wiking	" R is also sensitive to the name of the file extension in C and C++ mode. In C++ mode, the file extension must be .cpp rather than .cxx for the R compile command to recognize it. If your C++ code is in a file using something other than a .cpp extension, then it may still work using PKG_LIBS:
@wiking	swig"
@sonney2k	wiking, no we are doing something totally custom
@wiking	sonney2k: oh i see
@sonney2k	wiking, I did a bit of R debugging in the last days
@sonney2k	wiking, at least my minimal example worked with ref/unref jsut fine
@sonney2k	wiking, now I am trying to get a minimal shogun class to work
@sonney2k	say BinaryLables
@sonney2k	*Labels
@sonney2k	if this works then it is just some shogun thing
@sonney2k	but it is complex...
 foulwall`	ok, sonney2k, gotcha, will send a pr soon.

@sonney2k	wiking, did you have the chance to check the videos of the workshop?
 lambday	sonney2k: hi
@sonney2k	lambday, hey there!
 lambday	sonney2k: I need to add a different dense_dot in SGSparseVector, something that takes another template argument... say, when I need to compute sparse-matrix-vector product when matrix is complex64 and vector is float64
 lambday	sonney2k: would that be okay?
@sonney2k	lambday, it makes sense to have these
 lambday	sonney2k: okay... so adding a few of them, complex64, float64, int etc....
@sonney2k	lambday, I wanted to have this in CDotFeatures but IIRC deriving from a templated  class can be problem
@sonney2k	a
 thoralf	sonney2k: I thought you'll in holiday now?
 thoralf	you're
 lambday	sonney2k: umm.. problem as in?

 thoralf	Hey iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	good morning!
 van51	hey
 van51	sonney2k: I've sent a PR, when you have time please review it :)
 van51	sonney2k: I've started working on the streaming version of those
 van51	sonney2k: if you want to discuss anything I'll be around
 van51	lambday: I think it will be a bit messier to extend a templated class
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I will fix the SO multiclass example ASAP (I want to finish an LMNN thing first). But if you want to do it, feel free ;)
 van51	lambday: I tried it two-three days ago with DenseFeatures (which are templated)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No worries.
 van51	lambday: ofc I'm not a c++ expert (yet :P) so that may be we it troubled me
 van51	why*
 lambday	van51: yes templates are real pain :(
 lambday	van51: well I am thinking of having something like this
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I need multilabel instead of multiclass.  So I anyway will write my own example/classes.
 lambday	template<class T1> class { template<class T2> void foo(T2 a); };
 van51	lambday: yea I saw what you wanted to do, with the sparse product
 lambday	oops I forgot the class name itself :D
@iglesiasg	thoralf: Aham, I understand.
 lambday	van51: yes
 van51	lambday: i think it will be really useful :)
 lambday	van51: I hope so.. I will be using those anyway
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I spend a night reading your SO stuff and I think I need some modifications for multilabel.
 lambday	by the way, how did the workshop go, guys?
 lambday	saw the pics :)
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.13] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 van51	and what about the videos? :D
@iglesiasg	thoralf: So, first of all you need a new model, right? In multilabel you want to model dependencies between all pairs of classes, or not?
 lambday	yes yes what about the video :D
@iglesiasg	all pairs of labels, better said probably
 lambday	umm... make unit-tests now treats all warnings as errors :-/
@iglesiasg	lambday: the workshop was pretty cool
@iglesiasg	lambday: I enjoyed a lot the days in there. We had a couple of coding days during the weekend
 lambday	iglesiasg: awesome, man!!
@iglesiasg	van51: I think wiking or sonney2k are editing them and later they will be uploaded to youtube
 van51	iglesiasg: ok cool! thanks for letting me know
@iglesiasg	lambday, van51: did you guys follow the live stream?
 lambday	iglesiasg: no I couldn't :(
 lambday	iglesiasg: will the slides be available?
@iglesiasg	lambday: I thought they already were
@iglesiasg	lambday: have you checked the logs? I think there were some links to them pasted here
@iglesiasg	lambday: anyway, yes. I think they will be uploaded somewhere in the website once the videos are up and so on.
 lambday	iglesiasg: alright.. thanks.. I'll check it out :)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No, only between some classes.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: It's a taxonomy.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I don't even need to learn label-label interactions.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: Aham! Got it.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: So you could as well use directly multiclass classification too. Each class corresponding to a particular choice of the labels.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: How do I model that a class belongs to class i and class j?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: btw.: I have 7000 labels - so "label combinations" won't work. ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf: yeah, indeed that's way too many classes for doing that
@iglesiasg	thoralf: so if I understand correctly, for your labels you can probably use the Sequence labels, and for the features probably MatrixFeatures work well. What needs to be new is the StructuredModel

@iglesiasg	thoralf: it seems there is some conflict with it, right?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No, travis wasn't triggered.
 thoralf	I don't know why.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: but the PR cannot be merged from the github's interface
@iglesiasg	thoralf: "We can't automatically merge this pull request. Use the command line to resolve conflicts before continuing."
 thoralf	iglesiasg: That's weird.
 thoralf	I'll have a look.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I have not seen it before either. I would try to rebase to latest develop and see if I get any conflict
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Okay, I did a rebase and pushed it again (there was indeed a conflicting change) - let's hope github is able to merge it.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Travis runs, a good sign.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: good
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I am no real Makefile expert though, so I am probably not the right one to merge this. Do you need to get this merged soon?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I guess this happened because HeikoS PR got merged before mine - and introduced a conflict, which wasn't there before. ;)
@iglesiasg	probably
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Not really, but later merges mean more potential conflicts. ;)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I can explain my changes - would that help?
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I understand what's going on. But I don't know if it can potentially arise conflict with sometihng

 lambday	HeikoS: hey!
@HeikoS	hi
 lambday	HeikoS: I changed the template thing
 lambday	HeikoS: now will have to make sure that the unit-tests work properly and then I'll send PR
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	sounds good
 lambday	HeikoS: amazing about the engine and job :D
 lambday	HeikoS: I am in :D
@HeikoS	lambday: good to hear :) we would be very happy if you stayed with us after gsoc
@HeikoS	lambday: any reasons why you did not initialise  the m_operator in SparseMatrixOperator?
 lambday	HeikoS: wait... I am checking
@HeikoS	lambday: I think this is one source of the bug
@HeikoS	lambday: dont worry, I will investigate a bit nowq
 lambday	HeikoS: alright... I'll check it too
 lambday	so, in init I should do something like m_operator=SGSparseMatrix<T>();
@HeikoS	lambday: I think this is any automatically isnt it?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes that's why I didn't do anythng explicitely :-/
@HeikoS	lambday: you are right with that, my fault, checking other things now
 lambday	HeikoS: I am not sure what do you mean by initializing this one :(

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah, Berlin got you? :D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes totally
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: many Russians here, you should come ;)
 pickle27	from what i'
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am afraid I could do that one day
@HeikoS	still enjoying the city, will depart tomorrow
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: have you been to einstein stammhaus?
 pickle27	sorry from what I've heard Berlin would make a lot of places seem pheew
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: not yet
@HeikoS	pickle27: yeh its kinda nice here
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you should try their apfelstrudel and espresso I think!
@HeikoS	the only thing is: if you are here, you tend to not work but do other nice things ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha :) apfelstrudel and espresso! :)
 lisitsyn	not really cheap (these two ones would cost like around 10EUR)
 lisitsyn	pickle27: well as I have not been to any foreign country before
 pickle27	ah
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: really glad you liked it! :)
 pickle27	travelling is fun!

 pickle27	awesome!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what did you do on sunday?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you should, Berlin is among the nicest though!

@sonney2k	pfff
 lisitsyn	well at least I have found something for my mother (she has birthday in a few days)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh man I want to get back already
 lambday	HeikoS: add matrix?
 lambday	HeikoS: I didn't add that
@HeikoS	lambday: ah I see
 lambday	oh
 lambday	nono
@HeikoS	lambday: even so, is that correct, see email
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hehe
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you should come back, and next time hang out with us some more :)
 gsomix	lisitsyn, hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: checking
 lambday	HeikoS:
@HeikoS	lambday: ah found some more bugs in clone :(
 lambday	Parameter::add(SGSparseVector<complex64_t> has all CT_SCALARs
@HeikoS	lambday: I know
@HeikoS	sonney2k: how are sparse vectors represented
@HeikoS	CT_SCALAR ot CT_VECTOR?
 lambday	I mean Parameter::add(SGSparseVector<T> has all CT_SCALARs
@HeikoS	currenlty confused
@sonney2k	HeikoS, scalars yes
@HeikoS	sonney how about sparse matrix?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: and when do we use CT_VECTOR with ST_SPARSE?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, dirk designed it that way
@HeikoS	sonney2k: its fine, just need to know, so CT_VECTOR is never used along with ST_SPARSE ?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sparse matrix would be CT_SPARSE IMHO
@HeikoS	CT_SPARSE?
@HeikoS	we only have scalar, vector, matrix
@sonney2k	well we don't have that yet
@HeikoS	and ST_NONE and ST_SPARSE
@HeikoS	sonney2k: well yes there are combinations
@sonney2k	I am not up-to-date
@sonney2k	the idea was that one could have vectors/strings in a matrix
@HeikoS	sonney I see, makes sense
@HeikoS	sonney2k: but how about sparse vectors
@sonney2k	IMHO it makes things too complex
@HeikoS	so first thing is: sparse vectors of scalars
@sonney2k	we don't need that
@HeikoS	this would be CT_SCALAR and ST_SPARSE
@HeikoS	and then sparse matrices, how do we do that: in the code we have: ST_SPARSE and CT_MATRIX
@HeikoS	but thats weird
@HeikoS	not consistent
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well we don't have matrices of strings either
@HeikoS	sonney2k: no its all just scalar
@HeikoS	sonney2k: how do we represent sparse matrices of floats?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Lists of sparse vectors ;)
@sonney2k	well I would be totally fine if we just had a container type scalar/vector/...sparse_matrix
@sonney2k	with some primitive type
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I dont want to change things, just understand
@sonney2k	and rather sgstring as container type
@sonney2k	I am saying that this is how I would have liked it to be
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok I agree on that, but for now I want to fix that bug
@sonney2k	now we have for strings IIRC CT_VECTOR with ST_STRING
@HeikoS	and its related to sparse matrix things
@sonney2k	so that is why ST_SPARSE is the correct thing to do with this framework
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I am just wondering how to represent sparse matrices correct
@sonney2k	so you have a vector of sparse
@HeikoS	yes, thats CT_SCALAR and ST_SPARSE
@sonney2k	yeah
@HeikoS	and now I want sparse matrix, which seems to be CT_MATRIX and ST_SPARSE
 thoralf	I like the scipy compressed sparse matrices.
@sonney2k	no and no
@sonney2k	shogun sparse vector === CT_SCALAR + ST_SPARSE
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I found this:
@sonney2k	shogun sparse matrix == CT_VECTOR + ST_SPARSE
@HeikoS	void Parameter::add(SGSparseMatrix<bool>* param,
@HeikoS	const char* name, const char* description)
@HeikoS	{
@HeikoS	TSGDataType type(CT_SGMATRIX, ST_SPARSE, PT_BOOL, &param->num_vectors,
@HeikoS	&param->num_features);
@HeikoS	add_type(&type, &param->sparse_matrix, name, description);
@HeikoS	}
@sonney2k	thoralf, heh they have 3 formats - so which one?
@HeikoS	whats that?
 thoralf	sonney2k: compressed row/columns
@sonney2k	LIL, CSC, CRS
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I see, whats this code snippet doing the?
@sonney2k	thoralf, they are static though...
@HeikoS	there
@HeikoS	sonney2k: any ideas?
@sonney2k	thoralf, I mean no way to add a vector / insert
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yeah, that's right.
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ohh I see an issue - with CT_VECTOR you cannot say how many dims the sparse matrix has
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so thats might be the reason why it is CT_MATRIX?
 thoralf	sonney2k: Nobody wants to change sparse matrices... I always treat them as if they were read-only ;)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: that makes sense
 thoralf	sonney2k: Btw: Appending vectors works well.
@sonney2k	thoralf, I mean for dense matrix types it totally makes sense to use just one big array (lapack & friends are optimized for that like hell) no idea if sparse libs have similiar optimiaztions
 thoralf	sonney2k: At least for CSR
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah I guess but it is totally crap
@HeikoS	sonney2k: how would be the best way?
@HeikoS	just have container types only I guess: SCALAR, VECTOR, MATRIX, SPARSE_VECTOR, SPARSE_MATRIX?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, doing it with CT_SGSPARSEMATRIX
@HeikoS	and drop ST?
@sonney2k	and CT_SGSPARSEVECTOR
@sonney2k	yeah I would love to drop ST_*
@HeikoS	how to do strings then?
@HeikoS	vectors of chars?
@sonney2k	but I guess we can only drop it once strings are gone
 thoralf	sonney2k: Hmm, I think sparse matrices are hard to optimize.  I'm just thinking of dot products.
 thoralf	sonney2k: So many conditions.  I'd like to know how sparse a vector needs to be for that to pay.
@sonney2k	strings would be CT_SGSTRINGLIST
@HeikoS	I see, so no strings of matrices etc?
@sonney2k	thoralf, I guess people like the one doing gotblas would do that
@HeikoS	only SGObject
@HeikoS	sonney2k: man, this should have been done before clone/equals
 thoralf	gotblas
 thoralf	gotblas?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I admittedly would prefer doing a new type for that when it happens
@HeikoS	soooo much refactoring now
@sonney2k	thoralf, gotoblas
 thoralf	Oh, damn.  Gotta got.  See you!
@HeikoS	thoralf: bye!
@sonney2k	thoralf, cu!!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: parameter framework could be redone somehow then
@HeikoS	most classes dont interact that much
@sonney2k	I suspect it woudl be much easier this way
 lambday	HeikoS: I'll be back later
 lambday	see you
@HeikoS	sonney2k: mmh, so we would have to rewritte: adding/storing/registering and then load/save, and migrate(useless anyway in its current state)
@HeikoS	lambday: bye!
-!- lambday [67157e4f@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.79] has quit []
@HeikoS	sonney2k: equals/clone once more
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sorry is it really that much?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: dont know
@HeikoS	trying to find out :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I mean ST_* exisits only for NONE and STRING
@sonney2k	so it cannot be
@sonney2k	I think just string needs to be done differently
@sonney2k	then all good
@HeikoS	sonney2k: save/load/migrate/equals/clone are all totally dependent on the structure CT/ST
@HeikoS	if we drop one, these basically have to be re-done
@HeikoS	and when we do this, we can also change the TSGDataType
@HeikoS	because its totally annoying
@HeikoS	and then we can also do things in a way that migration is easier
@sonney2k	sure just drop this parameter but then all the rest will still work
@HeikoS	(allocating paramters from scratch etc)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: dont know whether all that is feasible for someone doing other things ....
@HeikoS	might be a good GSoC project
@HeikoS	but ultra hard
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you are the expert with migration / modsel / parameters
@sonney2k	who would know if not you
@HeikoS	sonney2k: you :D
@sonney2k	but just removing SG_* seems very easy!
@sonney2k	ST_*
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok, maybe thats a good start
@sonney2k	simply stuff later is a different problem
@HeikoS	sonney2k: what do you think about all those types that are blowing up Parameter.h?
@HeikoS	uint16_t?
@HeikoS	I never used that
@HeikoS	rather float64, float32, int32, int64, char
@HeikoS	not even unsigned
@HeikoS	sonney2k: oh on another thing:
@HeikoS	sonney2k: the spectrum kernel currently is done via those obtain_from_* method of string features
@HeikoS	which then generates this sparse representation of the k-mer counts
@HeikoS	and those are given to a kernel
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so no model-selection of k-mer length
@HeikoS	since one cannot do model-selection over features
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I am only using unsigned stuff like uint16_t / 32_t 64_t for strings
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I did some other spectrum features using all k=1...max_K
@sonney2k	with weights
@sonney2k	forgot what the name was
@sonney2k	but maybe it has the same problem
@HeikoS	sonney2k: can the kernel select the weights?
@sonney2k	don't remember
@HeikoS	ok
@sonney2k	IMHO it is not that much of a problem
@HeikoS	sonney2k: no problem, but no automated model selection
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hey I just checked andreas mail
@HeikoS	sonney2k: btw model selection framework might be a bit useless anyway
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I've been working on this today
@HeikoS	sonney2k: what counts more is cross-validation
@HeikoS	since grid-search is just a loop
 pickle27	lisitsyn: Im actually about to send an reply
@HeikoS	which users could easily set up themselved
@HeikoS	s
 lisitsyn	pickle27: okay sure!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: but is very hard to maintain
@HeikoS	if we offer it
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I am on vacations still so I'd try to do my best to get into algorithms and help with further planning
@HeikoS	sonney2k: at least for grid-search
@HeikoS	sonney2k: gradient based things are different
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah no prob, I have still got a bunch of things I want to get done before getting fully into example mode
 lisitsyn	pickle27: is everything alright with your masters thesis?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah I submitted and my defence is on Aug 1!
 lisitsyn	oh I see
 pickle27	I meant shogun things to get done!
 lisitsyn	what do you mean? by aug 1?
 pickle27	I mean there is a few more techniques I want to finish coding for shogun before I start putting all my attention to the final examples
 pickle27	Aug 1 is when I present my thesis
 lisitsyn	ahh alright

@sonney2k	hey iglesiasg - back home?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: hi! yeah, I got here yesterday at night
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: are you already in holiday?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: hi!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: thanks for setting up the doodle!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah watching the sun set over the sea currently
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes, good to have the meeting soon
@HeikoS	sonney2k: nice :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: it sounds nice
@sonney2k	doing (late) nips reviews
@sonney2k	all rejects IMHO :/
@iglesiasg	haha
@sonney2k	HeikoS, never get yourself's paper reviewed by me
@sonney2k	I don't remember accepting papers
@iglesiasg	we better hope for our papers not to be reviewed by you :P
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  maybe you have mine :)
@HeikoS	kameleon
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: did you submit sth to NIPS?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: yes
@HeikoS	some kernel mcmc stuff
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: interesting, I wish you luck with it!
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well we all have seen HeikoS talks so we can be pretty sure that this gets accepted
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: thanks!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: writing is different ;)
@HeikoS	but I think it will be fine
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: btw, I was gladly surprised with Berlin. I found it an amazing place
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah I like it too :)
@HeikoS	it is amazing :) I would find it hard to work here though - so many other nice things to do :)
@HeikoS	going now, see you!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sonney2k: BTW, could any of you take a quick look at thoralf PR when you get some time?
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I did, I think its ok, but I dont know enough of makefiles t omerge it, sonney2k, wiking, or lisitsyn should have a look
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: all right
@iglesiasg	we are in the same boat about Makefiles hehe
@iglesiasg	bye HeikoS
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah had a look - not in mergeable state yet
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: because of the crash in travis build?
@iglesiasg	I think that may actually be my fault, it seems to be something is CustomMahalanobisDistance
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no not because of that

 gsomix	refactoring, refactoring, refactoring
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, wrt the PR I have to discuss a couple of things ...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: the LMNN PR, right? Tell me about it.
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: after Saturday's conversation I realized there is no need to make the methods static to avoid including LMNNImpl.h in LMNN.h, just need to do this forward declaration of the class CLMNNImpl. So I was thinking of doing that and make the methods non-static
