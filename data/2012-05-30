 sonne|work	heiko: whats up?
 heiko	sonne|work, hi
 sonne|work	hey ...
 heiko	currently: NIPS, exam on friday, (so far: exam yesterday)
 sonne|work	crazy
 sonne|work	hope you survive this
 heiko	but also reading stuff to implement eigenspectrum based threshold estimate for quadratic MMD
 heiko	yeah me too :)
 sonne|work	you did ping me yesterday?
 heiko	yes, I was just asking whether shogun had eigenvalue methods, but then I found them myself
 heiko	I added this little convienience methods using SGVectors though
 heiko	whats up in Berlin?
 sonne|work	heiko: yeah I wanted to move more functions from CMath -> SGVector etc
 sonne|work	so you patch is very welcome
 heiko	so all of them should be converted?
 sonne|work	heiko: in two days I will be on paternal leave
 heiko	I would love to see the display methods
 sonne|work	so just finishing up stuff
 sonne|work	heiko: yes exactly
 heiko	paternal leave?
 sonne|work	you know play time with kids ;-)
 heiko	sonne|work, ok then Ill convert all methods I touch
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	nice
 heiko	dont forget to do that over all the coding :D
 sonne|work	heiko: no worries will be on holidays too so no time for coding next week
 heiko	sonne|work, nice!
 heiko	sonne|work, I really like these director classes, havent tried them yet though, but its awesome
 sonne|work	yeah I think so too
 sonne|work	only problem is speed penalty
 sonne|work	so factor 10 slower...
 sonne|work	but hey could be worse
 heiko	yes, but I mean
 heiko	sometimes people that dont want to get involved into internals just want a new kernel
 heiko	or a new other thing
 heiko	and now thats possible
 blackburn	heiko: do you need full spectrum?
 sonne|work	yeah. but we have to enable that one by one
 heiko	blackburn, no, eigenvalues are fine so far, still experimenting a bit
 sonne|work	it will only be possible case by case
 blackburn	heiko: all eigenvalues?
 heiko	sonne|work, but thats fine
 sonne|work	we need to figure out for which cases we need this stuff...
 heiko	blackburn, yes, so far, although I will sort them and only use most numerically stable ones
 blackburn	for max/min you can use arpack I mean
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	currently using the lapack based compute_eigenvalues thingi
 blackburn	a lot of options
 blackburn	heiko: dsyev?
 heiko	yes that one
 heiko	isnt arpack more for sparse matrices?
 heiko	will be back in 5 mins ...
 blackburn	heiko: no - reverse interface - it is like COFFIN for eigenstuff
 blackburn	it depends on structure of matrix
 blackburn	basically it is pretty related to krylov subspace method
 blackburn	which require span of [ Ax A^2 x .... ]
 blackburn	so for example like in power method for largest eigenvalue it would require only few matrix vector products
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw I was thinking about getting DirectorDOTFeatures to work
 blackburn	what do you have in mind
 blackburn	?
 sonne|work	and I think one way to do it is to define all these add/dense_dot etc operations again but based on SGVector
 sonne|work	so then the low-level functions would call the sgvector ones
 sonne|work	and these are the ones that via typemaps etc are nicely exposed to python and other langs
 blackburn	yes obvious
 blackburn	hmm while you are available
 blackburn	what do you think about openmping it gradually?
 blackburn	I attempted to openmp everything but it needs to be rebased now totally
 heiko	re
 sonne|work	blackburn: regarding openmp - maybe you can openmp the most difficult part, e.g. dotfeatures first. if this works then I think it will work for all stuff
 sonne|work	(works == same speed as w/ pthreads)
 blackburn	yes but shall I commit it then?
 blackburn	really hard to track one more branch
 heiko	blackburn, I will just have a look how it works and compare against my matlab implementation and then get back to you
 blackburn	ok
 heiko	have to study kernel covariance operator now :)

 blackburn	n4nd0: did you finish your exams?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah!
 blackburn	I just came with cool game - everyone say some math word and I have to put some sentence with it to my thesis :D
 gsomix	blackburn, topology
 blackburn	easy
 blackburn	n4nd0: your turn
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me think...
 gsomix	blackburn, ok. then I think I need to consult with Verbitsky, hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: curl
 blackburn	n4nd0: hah ok!
 blackburn	ok currently diffeomorphism, curl, Darboux sum, topology (gsomix want to change?)
 blackburn	puffin444: surprise me
 blackburn	sonney2k: and you :)
 puffin444	Noetherian Rings
 gsomix	blackburn, nope.
 blackburn	oh sh
 puffin444	Did I break your thesis?
 blackburn	yes probably it is not about svms anymore
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	however one guy said Klein group already
 blackburn	uh I asked him to change :D
 blackburn	affinity now
 blackburn	puffin444: could you please change? :D
 blackburn	sounds like a bit of hardcore to put rings to svms :D
 puffin444	Uhh... Dense Set
 blackburn	hah ok!
 blackburn	thanks :)
 blackburn	in summary, I need to add affinity, curl, dense set, topology, diffeomorphism, darboux sum
 blackburn	okk sounds crazy :D

 puffin444	Anybody here an expert in blas?
 blackburn	well not expert but have some experience
 blackburn	what is the issue?
 puffin444	So I am calling cblas_dposv, Solves Ax=B where A is a positive symmetric matrix
 blackburn	right
-!- cwidmer [~chris@HSI-KBW-046-005-237-106.hsi8.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de] has joined #shogun
 puffin444	It is somehow possible that the contents of A get modified during the function?
 blackburn	yes it modifies A
 blackburn	stores cholesky upper triangular L
 puffin444	Should I be calling clapack_dposv or dposv_?
 blackburn	clapack_dposv
 blackburn	puffin444: in mathematics/lapack.h we provide impl of clapack_dposv that calls usually fortran extern dposv_
 blackburn	if atlas is available no need to define clapack_dposv so it will be used from atlas with the same interface
 puffin444	I think I have been just using the wrong function all along
 blackburn	where?
 puffin444	There got it now. I should have been using clapack_dpotrs as I already had the factorization
 blackburn	ah yes
 blackburn	dpotrf and dpotrs
 blackburn	dposv is dpotrf and dpotrs basically
 blackburn	however multiple calls of dposv make no sense
 blackburn	it would factor factors
 puffin444	Exactly
 puffin444	Yay! I can calculate the gradients now!
 blackburn	heh cool
 puffin444	Ok. I think its time to take a break. See you later.
 blackburn	cu

 n4nd0	blackburn: hey, I got one question
 n4nd0	blackburn: why is it that we cannot have modular interface for matlab?
 blackburn	easy question - swig does not support it :D
 n4nd0	aham I see
 n4nd0	my friend is using shogun for his thesis
 n4nd0	he started with octave and it was all right
 n4nd0	but he needed some OOP and it looks like octave is somewhat limited there
 blackburn	python is the key to everything
 n4nd0	so he's now in matlab but found that there's no modular interface there
 n4nd0	I think he will manage with static in any case

 gsomix	good night guys
 gsomix	exam is tomorrow... networks
 blackburn	good luck
 heiko	good luck
 gsomix	tnx
 blackburn	heiko: are you busy right now?
 heiko	no, resting :)
 heiko	blackburn, but in generell yes
 heiko	NIPS till friday
 heiko	and I got an exam on friday also
 blackburn	I have one ML question
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	what is it is about?
 heiko	exam or nips?
 heiko	I mean, I if I can help you, I will enjoy doing it :) whats the question?
 blackburn	heiko: do you know what is L1/Lq norm?
 blackburn	both exam and nips
 heiko	blackburn, exam is about kernel theory: RKHS theory, some kernel algorithms, distributions in feature space, MMD, a bit of convex optimisation
 blackburn	heh cool
 heiko	nips working title is kernel selection for large scale two sample tests
 heiko	yes the course was pretty cool
 heiko	I know Lq norm
 blackburn	I have troubles deriving dual of some special task
 heiko	using Lagrangian?
 blackburn	L1/Lq is basically if you divide your vector to some cells and compute Lq of it
 blackburn	summarizing it with L1
 blackburn	L1/L2 of [1 2 3 4] = (1+4) + (9+16)
 blackburn	if groups are first twos and second
 heiko	oh that is used in the group lasso right?
 blackburn	heh exactly
 blackburn	the problem is I do not understand how ||w||^2 would looks like in terms of alphas :)
 blackburn	would look*
 heiko	do you have like a formal description of the problem?
 blackburn	no but let me try to latex it a little
 heiko	you can use gmailtex
 heiko	(thats faster /easier than whole latex procedure)
 blackburn	http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?||w||_{1/2}%20=%20\sum_{g%20\in%20G}%20||w_g||_2
 blackburn	heiko: is that idea clear for you?
 blackburn	let G some indices space :)
 heiko	mmh that graphic isnt properly displayed here
 blackburn	why??
 blackburn	wait I start to think my question is stupid
 heiko	I cannot read it :(
 blackburn	argh
 heiko	background is black instead of white
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	and font is also black
 blackburn	heiko: ok nevermind I have to think about it a little more
 heiko	I am only seeing the antialiased pixels
 blackburn	the thing I was confused is how to compute derivate of dual lagrangian by w
 blackburn	if norm is complicated
 heiko	ah ok
 heiko	derivatives of norms
 heiko	I always do it component wise if this happens
 heiko	and the re-assemble the result later once I understand whats going on
 blackburn	in case of 2 norm it is pretty basic
 blackburn	just like scalars
 heiko	are you talking about the SVM dual?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	just want to get liblinear easy patched
 blackburn	it is based on gradient so I think if I had it I would patch it
 heiko	mmh, I dont really get it, but nevermind, have you solved it though?
 blackburn	solved what?
 blackburn	I think I have to formulate questions more precisely :D
 blackburn	just confused you
 heiko	yes :)
 heiko	well, I gotta go to  bed anyway
 heiko	We can discuss tomorrow if you want
 blackburn	ok :)
 heiko	I will be st
 heiko	I will be online during the day since I have to study :)
 heiko	good night

 blackburn	good night
