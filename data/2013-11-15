@sonney2k	besser82, so how is your .spec progressing?
@sonney2k	or in other words will I win?
 besser82	sonney2k: I dunno...  I'm pretty @ finish, but I'm on travel for today and tomorrow ---> Lit-Oldenburg
 besser82	sonney2k: meeting with some of me FC, RH and Heise buddies...
 besser82	sonney2k: nerd-social :-P   btw. Are you better today?
@sonney2k	besser82, looks like I did catch some additional cold but so lala
@sonney2k	wiking, should we release some 3.0.1 with what we have now?
-!- zxtx [~zv@64.134.67.0] has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
@wiking	soon yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, actually we cannot until hushell's notebook works again
@sonney2k	wiking, can I with cmake somehow enable building of libshogun.a ?

@sonney2k	wiking, I am close to having the .deb ready - another question related to that - how can I say I don't want optimized code with -march=native but just wiht -O3?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hey moin
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hey
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, any news about markdown?
@iglesiasg	I didn't have time to do anything new yet
@iglesiasg	I should be able to do it during the weekend
@sonney2k	ok...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it is not something I can do right away, because I don't know how to do it. So I need to sit down for a couple of hours read the doc and do it :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, it is not a 10 min sort of thin, at least for me ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, well it is ... sth like markdown.render('string')
@sonney2k	done
@iglesiasg	arrgh man, not really
@sonney2k	actually if you use the markdown templatetags it is even simpler
@iglesiasg	if it was only that line, I guess you would do it without asking me in one minute
@sonney2k	you can just write {{text|markdown:"safe"}}
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, look at how I this is in the mloss.org source code ...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I am asking you because I am working on the .deb package
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, where is the markdown rendered in mloss?
 shogun-buildbot_	build #318 of FCRH - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FCRH%20-%20libshogun/builds/318  blamelist: Roman Votyakov <votjakovr@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, is it in the Shogun entry of mloss or somewhere else in the mloss webpage?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, all pages are markdown
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes changelog and shogun entry all of it
@iglesiasg	all right, I am looking into it right now (just postponed my thesis stuff I was doing...)
@iglesiasg	let's see if it takes 10 mins
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, e.g http://www.dominicrodger.com/django-markdown.html
 shogun-buildbot_	build #319 of FCRH - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FCRH%20-%20libshogun/builds/319  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am very likely doing something terrible: http://pastebin.com/ET5sRDVH
@iglesiasg	I hard coded the file to fetch, README.md, just to get a first test working
@iglesiasg	but the markdown is still not rendered on the website :/
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hardcode a string there for your test
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and later yes we will probably have to add some list with *.md's that we could pre-read into memory and even already keep prerendered in memory
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, didn't work out with a string in readme instead of response.read()
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, err no you are defining a templatetag - a filter
@sonney2k	so you have to write things like
@sonney2k	{{ object | get_readme }}
@sonney2k	and object is then containing the string
@sonney2k	or you just define a url hook with the readme
@sonney2k	and do it without a template tag
-!- hushell [~hushell@c-50-188-141-210.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 268 seconds]
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, how can I put a string into object?
@iglesiasg	to do {{  object | get_readme }}
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just make object a string
@iglesiasg	I don't know the syntax
@sonney2k	I mean object='foo bar' and pass it in the context of the template
@iglesiasg	{% object = 'foo bar' %} didn't really work out
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no on the python side!
@iglesiasg	aham! Now that makes more sense
@iglesiasg	let's deal with an invalid filter error now
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, any idea why  the get_readme above can raise an invalid filter error?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just don't do it with a filter now please
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just do some
@sonney2k	def foo(request):
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, should that still go on the templatetags?
 shogun-buildbot_	build #2023 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test ruby modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2023  blamelist: Roman Votyakov <votjakovr@gmail.com>
@sonney2k	  markdown2.markdown("*boo!*")
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2#readme
@sonney2k	or the normal markdown (not the 2)
@iglesiasg	it does not really display it nicely right away
@iglesiasg	the table is not formatted
@iglesiasg	and the quick links to the file fail as well
@iglesiasg	but I find it weird because in markdown2's readme it is stated that it supports tables
@iglesiasg	ah and the same thing happens with markdown (the module without the 2)

 sonne|osx	only nlopt
