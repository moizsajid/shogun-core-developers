 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb73b2c1 / (7 files in 5 dirs):
 CIA-3	shogun: add some helper functions like clear vector, fill vector etc to SGVector
 CIA-3	shogun: This unfortunately causes conflicts w/ modelselection that using
 CIA-3	shogun: SGVector<void>. Until ms is resolved to use sth else it will remain broken. - http://git.io/Lnpp6g
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rdd4e99f / (10 files): add new .cs examples from daniel - http://git.io/qok8NQ

 blackburn	sonney2k: heh did you broke modelselection?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	it is using SGVector<void>
@sonney2k	that clashes with any of the new functions like zero()
@sonney2k	fill()
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	so MS has to be done differently
@sonney2k	not exactly sure how though - need to talk/chat to heiko
 blackburn	will you fix it?
@sonney2k	I am not sure I can
 blackburn	I don't have a clue about his impls
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the next release date?
 blackburn	I'd say december is perfect
@sonney2k	blackburn, whenever we have sth ready
@sonney2k	currently I am only moving stuff from .h -> .cpp
@sonney2k	and will hopefully be able to remove Array*
@sonney2k	(not easy)
 blackburn	I did superlu integration and continuing with auto-dim-reduction techniques
@sonney2k	then I would wish to have all the platforms, osx, cygwin, linux working and being integration tested in the buildbot
@sonney2k	and hopefully heiko's migration stuff and nicer modelselection ...
@sonney2k	and other bugfixes of course
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you think about CUDA, etc?
@sonney2k	opencl you mean?
@sonney2k	for which algorithms?
 blackburn	yeah techs of this kind
 blackburn	no idea
@sonney2k	I played around with this some time ago - it didn't help for strings
 blackburn	I will be involved with some cuda svms
@sonney2k	it might for other simpler applications
 blackburn	probably
 blackburn	well I will be do images
@sonney2k	there is already one which is OSS
 blackburn	OSS?
 blackburn	well nor me or you do string kernel learning right now
 blackburn	no chance I will do with next two years :)
 blackburn	but I will be working with images
@sonney2k	http://code.google.com/p/multisvm/
 blackburn	and why not to create branch of gpu accelerated shogun
 blackburn	sure but we could have many more things
 blackburn	not only svm
 blackburn	it would be impressive to use any advantages of machines
 blackburn	no idea where to get so much time to get it done :D
@sonney2k	and the hardware that uses it...
@sonney2k	I don't even have any serious graphics adapter
@sonney2k	so *I* cannot do this
 blackburn	me too
@sonney2k	I don't mind it being done
@sonney2k	though
 blackburn	okay we will see
 blackburn	I guess if I will need some cuda svms I will do it standalone first
 blackburn	hmm I won't do svms I guess
@sonney2k	so I would continue to parallelize other code for multicore before attempting this
 blackburn	but may be something useful
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	and then merge if possibel
