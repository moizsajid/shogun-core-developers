 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hi, there?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: about t-SNE interface task, do I remember the steps correctly: 1. Add include in modular/Converter_includes.i . 2. Add rename in modular/Converter.i. 3. Add some graphical example in examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: better not graphical but simple in examples/undocumented/python_modular first

 vivekn	Hi, I am interested in implementing the Hashing Trick for GSoC, as I have used it for reducing memory usage with n-grams in one of my previous projects on sentiment classification. What are the specific features the shogun project is expecting for this?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok. Something like converter_factoranalysis_modular.py (with FactorAnalysis replaced by t-SNE class) should work, shouldn't it?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: exactly like that
 vivekn	How can I start contributing and are there any entrance tasks pertaining to this idea?
@lisitsyn	vivekn: no there is no particular task for this idea so feel free to contribute with anything you like
 deerishi	@lisitsyn :i am having some problem with the integration test
 deerishi	https://github.com/deerishi/KernelPCA-test-check/commit/743d3d9bc373aa36b0ea4bb7065ed36ba8706a93
 deerishi	could you check it?
@lisitsyn	deerishi: let me check
@lisitsyn	deerishi: looks like exactly like heiko said
@lisitsyn	the name of the function should be the same with the filename
 deerishi	which function are we talking about?
 deerishi	def generator?
 deerishi	or def get_fname?
@lisitsyn	deerishi: the function in the preprocessor_kpca.py
-!- vivekn [318aa50a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.49.138.165.10] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 deerishi	i renames the function in preprocessor_kpca as the same, but it still gives the same error
 deerishi	@lisitsyn any comments?
@lisitsyn	deerishi: I haven't seen the file
 deerishi	i had sent a pull request https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1014
@lisitsyn	deerishi: the function and the file have different names here
 deerishi	this is the old pr.i tried renaming the function in the file preprocessor_kpca just now
@lisitsyn	then it should work please carefully check they are the same
 deerishi	one more thing,should i add the name preprocessor_kpca.py to the backlist of the file generator.py
 deerishi	?
@lisitsyn	deerishi: only if it fails :)
 deerishi	i added that,which removed the error,but the 2 text files being created are broken

@iglesiasg	deerishi_: have you tried tracking the line where this fails?
 deerishi_	yes,
 deerishi_	in the generator.py
@iglesiasg	Heiko said that ir worked in his machine after renaming thoug
@iglesiasg	though*
 deerishi_	i tried that too.
 deerishi_	i submited a pr after changing the function name

 alibezz	hey yall
@iglesiasg	hi alibezz
 alibezz	I'm interested in working as an intern at GSoC 2013
 alibezz	just sent my introduction to the mail list yesterday (Aline Bessa)
@iglesiasg	alibezz: yeah, I read your mails :) welcome around here
 alibezz	iglesiasg: thanks!
-!- sids_aquarius [~sidi_@14.139.122.114] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	alibezz: I am also applying for a GSoC project
 alibezz	iglesiasg: Is it necessary to solve a bug to be able to participate?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: yes. You should submit a patch; that can be a bug fix, a new feature,...
 alibezz	iglesiasg: ok, any ideas about how I can find a good yet simple one?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: there are some tasks in github issues
@iglesiasg	alibezz: see for the ones labelled as entrance
 alibezz	iglesiasg: thanks! i have a paper deadline for Thursday, but will do my best to accomplish that. =)
@iglesiasg	alibezz: cool, also you are free to submit patches after the application deadline
@iglesiasg	IMHO, the more contributions you have, the stronger applicant you are
 alibezz	iglesiasg: chill, thanks for the advice. but it is important to have something **before** the application deadline, right? it's a pity I just became aware of GSoC late this year.
@iglesiasg	alibezz: mmm I don't think it is specially important to have something **before**
 alibezz	iglesiasg: I'll try to figure it out. ;) thanks, iglesiasg!
@iglesiasg	it is important to have it before the mentors make their decision
@iglesiasg	alibezz: you are welcome :)

 alibezz	iglesiasg: are you aware of any that is specifically related to dimensionality reduction?
@iglesiasg	alibezz: mmm not really
 alibezz	iglesiasg: k ;)
@iglesiasg	alibezz: I know some DR methods that we are missing and the matlab DR toolbox has
@iglesiasg	such as maximum variance unfolding IIRC
 alibezz	iglesiasg: maybe that could be a starting point
 alibezz	iglesiasg: like, integrating these.
@iglesiasg	alibezz: in my opinion it could be indeed
@iglesiasg	alibezz: lisitsyn (mentor of the project) may be around and give his opinion about this
 alibezz	iglesiasg: k, i'm currently finishing my formal application. once i'm done, can i ping you to discuss it in further detail?
 alibezz	iglesiasg: oh cool, i'll ping him
 alibezz	iglesiasg: which project are you applying to?

 alibezz	iglesiasg: chill. were you at NIPS last year?
@lisitsyn	re
@lisitsyn	alibezz: answering your mail: the sooner the better I think
 alibezz	lisitsyn: you mean the patch?
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	we will have a pressure to decide rather fast after the deadline

@lisitsyn	alibezz: just fyi you currently have one competitor for the dimension reduction idea :)
 alibezz	chill. iglesiasg suggested me to try integrating some DM matlab algorithms to the shogun framework. do you think this is simple enough giving the time constraints? I'd like to send something until Thursday or Friday. Thing is: I have a conference deadline as well, so my time will be rather small.
 mikhailBelous	Hello, I would like to know, do you need some students who intrested in machine learning and have a huge c++ optimization expirience. Is some mentor for this task now online?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: I'm also interested in the mldata project, given that I have some background with accessibility
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: huge is like?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: but seriously, if you could suggest me a task that you think that can be accomplished until Friday?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: no "if you" haha just "could..."
@lisitsyn	alibezz: I'll come with something and let you know
 alibezz	lisitsyn: thank you VERY much! i am really interested in this project!

@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: so if you have such optimization skills just optimize something in shogun ;)
 alibezz	lisitsyn: is there anything in the Issues entry at github related to the DimRed project?
 alibezz	lisitsyn: I was thinking of starting today ;)
@lisitsyn	alibezz: I am thinking if some of them are still left
 alibezz	lisitsyn: yay #figerscrossed
@iglesiasg	alibezz: nah, no NIPS nor any other conference/journal for me yet :(
@iglesiasg	alibezz: what about you?
 alibezz	alibezz: I've been in NIPS once. but not because of a paper. haha I submitted a project to Women in Machine Learning and it got approved. It was co-located with NIPS so I went to both
 alibezz	iglesiasg: DUH i wrote alibezz instead of your name. haha
@iglesiasg	alibezz: nice!
@iglesiasg	yeah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: you see? I am not the only one around here talking to himself now :D
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: haha
@lisitsyn	nice
 alibezz	lolz
@lisitsyn	alibezz: okay what about sammon mapping?
@lisitsyn	I can describe it quite detailed
 alibezz	lisitsyn: woot go for it please ;)
@lisitsyn	alibezz: matlab code is available
 alibezz	lisitsyn: where's this issue? the sammon mapping one? on github?
@lisitsyn	alibezz: writing it
@iglesiasg	alibezz: just out of curiosity, what's about the paper you are preparing for this upcoming conference?
 alibezz	iglesiasg: according to the field of behavioral economics, everytime one looks at a list of items and is supposed to choose one of them, it does not depend only on the individual properties of each one of the items, but also on the universe of presented alternatives. so i model this mutual influence items exert on each other as pairwise factors, and individual qualities as individual factors. one can see it as a markov network, and then perform MAP inferenc
@iglesiasg	alibezz: it sounds interesting
 alibezz	iglesiasg: thx!
@iglesiasg	alibezz: do you have to perform parameter learning for the MRF too or are they given by some expert knowledge?
 alibezz	iglesiasg: actually, all factors are either spit out from a individual-item recommender learner, such as SVD++, and all pairwise factors are computed in a rather naive way so far, via maximum likelihood. I didn't go too far with the MRF anyways because it was too costly. I just show some experiments that illustrate that and show how the bayesian approximation is way faster, and also rather good, in practice.

@lisitsyn	no idea about erasmo carlos though
 alibezz	gonna think of something good to show ya. bout to eat something now. it's lunch time here. lemme know where you guys are from!

 alibezz	ok!
@lisitsyn	I can't assign it to arbitrary person
@HeikoS	deerishi: so if the generator worked, try the tester.py with the same argument, if this passes, commit the test data and the data version in the development repository
@lisitsyn	only shogun-toolbox members are available there unfortunately

 mikhailBelous	Can you suggest any library that should be optimized?
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: what do you mean?
 mikhailBelous	I wanna to do some contribution in optimization field, can you suggested something
@iglesiasg	within Shogun, or are you talking in general?
 mikhailBelous	Shogun
@iglesiasg	ah ok so math optimization I guess you are talking about
 mikhailBelous	Or worktime optimization
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: I implemented a method that you can find in structure/PrimalMosekSOSVM
 deerishi	@HeikoS : i am having some problem in pushing the repo
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: which needs Mosek
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: it would be nice if we could drop this requirement by adding a QP solver with box contraints
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  how does it work if someone who is not core dev wants to push to data?
 deerishi	i could not clone the repository,so i downloaded the  as zip folder and installed shogun
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: I can let you know more about the QP it needs to solve if you are interested
 deerishi	now how do  i push the entire thing into a particular branch of the repository i had forked
 mikhailBelous	It will be nice
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: I wrote a bit about it here http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/second-weekly-report-gsoc-2012/
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: PR
@lisitsyn	as usual
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so push to the forked data repo?
@HeikoS	and then PR the data?
@lisitsyn	yes
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: in that post there is some application dependent information on structured learning
@lisitsyn	the data PR should be merged first HeikoS
@HeikoS	well thats easy, deerishi, see above
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: but the idea is basically to get a solver like http://docs.mosek.com/6.0/capi/node007.html#250330792
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thanks for the tip!
@HeikoS	indeed thats a good idea .)
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: however I have just used that as a black box, I have no idea how complex can it be to implement that. It might even a better idea to find some open source code able to do that and integrate it
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: you may just learn any linear machine and benchmark how it computes the output on the test data
@lisitsyn	and make it faster if you have any ideas
@lisitsyn	without the loss of flexibility and crazy refactoring
 mikhailBelous	It looks simplier than qp realization
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: It may be a good idea to start off with something simpler ;)
@lisitsyn	I wouldn't expect it is feasible to come up with something much better than libqp in a reasonable time
 deerishi	@HeikoS: will do that ,and let you know soon
 mikhailBelous	But I think that QP can be solved by simple gradient method. But I may be wrong
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: the problem with libqp and this problem are the constraints
@iglesiasg	for box constraints, it only handles an equlity contrainst
@lisitsyn	all these libqp, mosek etc have been under development for a long long time
@iglesiasg	while this problem needs inequalities
@iglesiasg	IRRC
@lisitsyn	so no that's not simple at all
@iglesiasg	indeed
@HeikoS	deerishi: nice, Ill have a look tomorrow though since got some friends now visiting, see you!
 mikhailBelous	We have convex function on compact space, why it would be solved by gradient method?
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@90.219.232.242] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 mikhailBelous	*would not
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: they are all gradient based but they are not simple at all
 mikhailBelous	Okay, let me suggest this solution.
@lisitsyn	it matters a lot how general the problem you solve is
@lisitsyn	libqp is quite general, liblinear optimizer is less general
 mikhailBelous	Do you or do you not have a solution for this problem(math not code)?
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: which problem?
 mikhailBelous	Quadratic optimization with inequalities boundaries
@lisitsyn	in libqp this method is implemented if you are interested: http://www.recognition.mccme.ru/pub/papers/SVM/keerthi00convergence.pdf
@lisitsyn	I am not sure what the method the mosek stuff implements
@iglesiasg	me neither actually
@lisitsyn	it depends on the formulation
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: is the qp problem in SO the same as in basic svm?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: no, I don't think so. Let me ensure it
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: this version achieved with the cutting plane problem it is I think
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: the problem with SO is that you have a pretty large number of constraints, using a cutting plane algorithm you select the active ones and then you need to solve a QP
@iglesiasg	this QP is pretty much like Crammer-Singer with the margin scaled
@lisitsyn	oh yes yes
@lisitsyn	C-S is the thing that made SO
@lisitsyn	:)
@iglesiasg	:)
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: what is the function which gradient you would use there btw?
 mikhailBelous	To target function
@lisitsyn	but this doesn't handle the constraints right?
@lisitsyn	I mean we have to use the lagrange function there as we have constraints
 mikhailBelous	We go along gradient vector until we reach boundary
 mikhailBelous	What is lagrange fucnction when we use inequalities?
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: please check the paper I send to you - QP is usually formulated through its dual form

 alibezz	lisitsyn: I just submitted my GSoC proposal. If you could take a look at it when you have time and tell me if it's ok, I'd be glad!!

@iglesiasg	alibezz: I think that if you want to apply for two different ideas you need to submit two proposals
@iglesiasg	even if it is for the same org
@iglesiasg	just mentioning because I saw this Idea 1 and Idea 2, sorry if you already knew that :)
 alibezz	iglesiasg: I think I'll just apply for the DimRed project. I'm much more interested in this one!
 alibezz	iglesiasg: ok, I'll fix this later
 alibezz	;)
 alibezz	later today.
 mikhailBelous	Please, give me an advise how to watch project in some using linux?
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: what do you mean?
 mikhailBelous	I need IDE in order to read code, what do you use in linux?
 gsomix	mikhailBelous: vim
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: ah ok. I am not an IDE guy, I use terminal and vim as editor
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: eclipse of code::blocks might be a choice
 mikhailBelous	And how do you find function declaration and implementation?
@iglesiasg	mikhailBelous: I grep all the way :D
@lisitsyn	mikhailBelous: ctags + vim supports that quite ok
@lisitsyn	eclipse supports that natively so feel free to use it

 alibezz	iglesiasg: lisitsyn: fixed! this is the current version of my application http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/alibezz/1 if you guys have any suggestions, please let me know
@lisitsyn	alibezz: bahh you need a new notebook ;)
@iglesiasg	hehe
 alibezz	lisitsyn: seriously? well, I can always ssh a better machine in my university
@lisitsyn	alibezz: just kidding
@lisitsyn	I mean it is pretty old :)
 alibezz	lisitsyn: lolz YEAH IT IS hahaha my newer one broke.
@iglesiasg	too bad
 alibezz	lisitsyn: and now i myself am super low on cash... hahaha
 alibezz	lisitsyn: gonna buy a new one, maybe a mac-os, when I make some dough. ;)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hi there. So I implemented all the steps, also run generator.py on the created examle (it succeeded). But, when I run tests, my new example gives an 'EXCEPTION No module named modshogun', what is kind a strange, regarding that all other tests work ok. Any suggestions what this can be related to?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: hey
@lisitsyn	not really
 gsomix	alibezz: interesting proposal :)
@lisitsyn	alibezz: vgorbati: fight! :D
@lisitsyn	you are the competitors
@lisitsyn	*mortal kombat theme*
 alibezz	hahahahah well i might be losing already because I just arrived.
@iglesiasg	so epic one
@lisitsyn	alibezz: you submitted the proposal first though
 alibezz	well, no I'm gonna work on my paper, and then on the issue! ;)
 alibezz	see yall later!
@lisitsyn	see you
@iglesiasg	bye bye

@lisitsyn	what is the C++ idiom here in lines 20-31?

@iglesiasg	the dummy pattern
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	no

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: my mind is wrecked:) The purpose of this code is to determine whether a type T has a 'dummy' inside it, isn't it?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: that is why I do not like C++)
@lisitsyn	why?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: there are too much possibilities to shoot yourself in the foot:)
@lisitsyn	it is important that it is compile-time
@lisitsyn	TBH I am not in the trend of C++ haters :D
* sonney2k qualifies to be a java hater
@lisitsyn	hahah
@lisitsyn	well C++ sucks when you don't get it
@lisitsyn	that's for sure
@lisitsyn	sucks much more than everything else probably
 gsomix	sonney2k: hey!
@iglesiasg	we are all matlab haters, aren't we? :D
 gsomix	iglesiasg: nope
 gsomix	:3
@iglesiasg	gsomix: but.. but, python!
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: maybe it is like a very sophisticated tool, but personally I prefer understandable tools
 gsomix	iglesiasg: there is not python in my lab.
 gsomix	*no
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: what is understandable for you?
@iglesiasg	gsomix: wow so the pay for matlab licenses but don't download python? funny
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hard to explain:) python is understandable tool, pure C is understandable:)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: pay? I don't think so :D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: the only thing that I miss in pure C is templates
@iglesiasg	hehe
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: what else is left? classes/
 gsomix	iglesiasg: so, such is the objective reality
 gsomix	lisitsyn: tsssss
@sonney2k	gsomix, hey
 gsomix	sonney2k: yay! glad to see you
 gsomix	sonney2k: have a minute?
 gsomix	or second...
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: personally I do not see a big difference between calling myVector.sort() and sort(myVector).
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: for big projects it matters a lot
 gsomix	lisitsyn: vgorbati: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6knCdiUBz4
@sonney2k	gsomix, ask
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: maybe, maybe:) btw, have you seen the fake Stroustrup interview?:)
 gsomix	sonney2k: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19029407/ideas%20for%20gsoc%202013.txt
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: which?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: http://www.snopes.com/computer/program/stroustrup.asp this one:)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: even though it is fake, it is kind a interesting:)_
@sonney2k	gsomix, all certainly valid problems
@sonney2k	gsomix, but might be too difficult
@sonney2k	gsomix, e.g. r-modular is not sth I think you can fix nor the swig -> multiple modules
@lisitsyn	hah vgorbati I do not get the point of hating C++ a lot
@lisitsyn	I always hear things like 'I do not like pointers'
@lisitsyn	or 'it is very complex'
@lisitsyn	but nobody forces to use it, right? :D

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: well, I do not actually hate it, I just think that some thing could be done better, that's all:) Like in python (and when you will need the speed - just implement this part in C and use it as a linked library)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: do you really have any improvement to C++?
@lisitsyn	some things do feel wrong (like syntax)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: you mean python vs C++?
 gsomix	sonney2k: sad. are there another ideas for project?
@lisitsyn	but I do not have any suggestion at all
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: actually yes, I guess I am mainly concerned about syntax - after python I always fill that I write too much code when in C++)
@sonney2k	vgorbati, I totally agree
@sonney2k	gsomix, well we need file i/o stuff
@sonney2k	not sure if this is of interest to you
@lisitsyn	well that's not the intrinsic property of C++
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, c'mon it is
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: example?
@sonney2k	python is like 10 characters and c++ would be 1000 lines
@lisitsyn	if you avoid libraries or what?
 gsomix	sonney2k: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2013_ideas#fastio this?
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, sure I am exaggerating but its like it
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: usually people just do not exploit capabilities and write C+- instead of C++
 gsomix	sonney2k: hm, nice project
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: for example people keep writing inner loops to say compute vector norm
@lisitsyn	it is not only eigen that provides such things but blitz++ and armadillo and etc
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess, I've just lost one point as a GSoC applicant :)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: furthermore you are assuming stl is wrong - but it does reduce the # of LoC
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: no, why?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: because I do not like C++ as much as you do:) just kidding)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: am I stalin or what? :D
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I do like all the languages they are all cool
 gsomix	sonney2k: I think it's interesting idea. should/can I add something in it from my list of ideas?
@iglesiasg	ok, one more application to the batch :)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: let's stop the holywar on this point:)
@lisitsyn	haha
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we with iglesiasg do need a quick idea for some conference paper :D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: coffin is structured svm is the way :)
@lisitsyn	I do not get how it can help it though
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: http://cs409823.vk.me/v409823955/1836/D_Ps3YSxsak.jpg new photo from the city of accident black holes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, it looks like I've managed to finish the task - the test passes. Is it ok if I submit a PR now?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: btw t-sne has local minima so I'd blacklist it for now
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: wtf
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: but then we need a totally different test:)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: you could help in lot of stuff for it. You understand coffin, you are a coding master, etc :)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes - all converters are blacklisted IIRC
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: it is only PCA that produces the same result and even it can vary a little
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: :D yes, I guess some tests are 'blacklisted' in interesting manner - they call 'converter.apply(features)' and then 'return features' - that's how the result will be similar every time:)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: but at list they are checking, whether the apply method does not call an exception
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: is it ok if my test will be 'black-listed' in a similar manner?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: just blacklist it for real
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok
@lisitsyn	however
@lisitsyn	no idea
@lisitsyn	rather do a PR now
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	but yes, probably blacklisting it from the very beginning is the way
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, but currently test works as I described - it return original features - that is how it passes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: no, it produces the same result then
@lisitsyn	returned features are serialized with generator.py
@lisitsyn	then de-serialized and checked
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes, and the test passes (if only the apply method throws an exception)
@lisitsyn	if it was producing the different result
@lisitsyn	it would fail
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: does not throw*
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: the thing is, that calling 'converter.apply(features)' does not change the 'features' itself - it returns the embedding. So, 'return features' will just return original data every time - that's why the test won't fail
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: anyway, I got it - I will add it to blacklist and send a PR
@lisitsyn	ahhh
@lisitsyn	got it
@lisitsyn	yes you right
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: it came from the old time when it did change the feautres
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: so this tests should probably be refactored?
@lisitsyn	well they won't start working as tests anyway
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: even for say LLE
@lisitsyn	all the features in the embedded space
@lisitsyn	can be both multiplied by +1 or -1
@lisitsyn	and it will be correct
@lisitsyn	I mean sign of the eigenvector doesn't matter
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I meant that they should be gradually refactored so that they actually do return an embedding instead of original data + that they will be tested 'the right way'
@lisitsyn	yes but sounds like a long way
@lisitsyn	and it actually could become a unit test instead of integration test :D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: So the integration test can only test for equality of results, right?
@lisitsyn	no but it is supposed to do something like that
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, I got to go now - will submit a blacklisted test tomorrow
@lisitsyn	alright
 vgorbati	see you
