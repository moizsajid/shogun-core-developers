@wiking	lisitsyn: \o/
@wiking	did u disable stuff
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I require swig 3.0.7 now so we have bad situation on buildbot
 lisitsyn	wiking: do you have some access to reconfigure it a bit?
 lisitsyn	wiking: we need to disable csharp modular on deb3
@wiking	why?
@wiking	i mean i can add swig 3.0.7 for it
 lisitsyn	ah if you can
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: they now support some substitution
 lisitsyn	so we just use
 lisitsyn	size_1, size_2
 lisitsyn	no conflict
@wiking	wooohoo
@wiking	great
@wiking	ok lemme try to find a way to upgrade swig on that machine
