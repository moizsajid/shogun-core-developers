 blackburn	55k$ per year?! the default salary in ohloh.net calculator rocks
 blackburn	sonney2k: lets sell shogun :D
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	currently my salary is 3k/year ahaha
 blackburn	sonney2k: make in examples currently requires doc for .class files
 blackburn	in java
@sonney2k	what?
 blackburn	documentation for "MatrixTest.class" (file "descriptions/modular/MatrixTest.txt") missing
 blackburn	documentation for "MatrixTest.java" (file "descriptions/modular/MatrixTest.txt") missing
@sonney2k	erase the class files before doing make doc or fix the generate_documented.sh to exclude .exe  / .class files
@sonney2k	matrix/vector test should be removed btw

 serialhex	HA!!! blackburn GOT BLAMED!!!!!  IT'S UR FAULT!!!!!!
 serialhex	btw, is sonney2k around still??
 serialhex	hmm, asleep probably, i'll e-mail ya the problem i'm getting (same problem, 2 files)
 blackburn	serialhex: definitely not my fault ;)
 serialhex	no?? shogun-buildbot says different: "blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com"
 blackburn	yeah but take a look on log
 blackburn	compiler got segfault hah
 serialhex	ooh, lovely!
 serialhex	you just got blamed b/c you were the last to commit, and with a bunch of textfiles
 blackburn	yeah
 serialhex	i would think it would blame everyone who commited between the time it last built & the time it compiled
 serialhex	hey, do you have python modular compiled & installed??
 serialhex	^ blackburn
 blackburn	serialhex: I could compile now
 serialhex	well i want to test something, if it's not too much of a pain for you
 serialhex	though the ruby would be better
 shogun-buildbot	build #163 of octave_modular is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/octave_modular/builds/163  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 serialhex	cause then i could give you the code thats bein a pain for me
 blackburn	so what to install?
 blackburn	ruby-modular?
 shogun-buildbot	build #147 of ruby_modular is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/ruby_modular/builds/147  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	buildbot goes crazy
 blackburn	serialhex: got python installed, what to do?
 serialhex	see if distribution_histogram_modular.py in examples/undoc.../pyth_mod works
 serialhex	(yes, ui'm lazy)
 serialhex	when i run the ruby version iget a wonky error, and i'm not sure if it's just ruby or if it's shogun in general
 blackburn	serialhex: yeah it works
 blackburn	what is the error you get?
 serialhex	...i'll gist it
 serialhex	https://gist.github.com/1fe53c321c001132e6c4
 serialhex	maybe it's soemthing silly i'm missing in the translation between python & ruby....
 serialhex	^ blackburn

 shogun-buildbot	build #152 of python_modular is complete: Exception [exception git]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/python_modular/builds/152  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	serialhex: yeah I know what the error is
 serialhex	??? please tell!!!
 blackburn	serialhex: check if your load_dna removes '\n' char
 blackburn	if yes so it could be typemap error
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	serialhex: there are 120 lines in fm_test_dna.dat
 blackburn	err
 blackburn	92 in train_dna
 serialhex	hmm, it was joining them nto an array, each line a new element in the array
 blackburn	so hist[0]=92
 blackburn	is number of '\n's
 blackburn	does it remove \n char?
 serialhex	yes, it did, but then i changed it to put the entire file into the array, or just use the entire file, nothing :(
 blackburn	serialhex: try to cut lines
 serialhex	hmm... something wonky is going on...
 blackburn	e.g. take half of all of them
 serialhex	oh, derr....
 blackburn	if it is still failing - I suspect only typemap
 blackburn	serialhex: so how?
 serialhex	i forgot, the version of modshogun.rb i'm using is *not* being loaded, so nothing i do in it will fix anything, but i'm going to copy it over and see if i can fix the problem...
 blackburn	serialhex: but it is ruby load
 blackburn	not modshogun.rb related
 serialhex	well the modshogun.rb has the load_whatever functions in it
 blackburn	ahhhh
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	serialhex: just make a try with some not loaded data but ACTG
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	you can be sure in this way there are no '\n'
 serialhex	hmm... with or w/o the \n i get a new error with this: traindna = "ACTG"
 serialhex	distribution_histogram_modular.rb:16:in `set_features': Wrong arguments for overloaded method 'StringCharFeatures.set_features'.
 serialhex	^ is trhe new error :P
 blackburn	serialhex: try array of "ACTG" "TCGA"
 blackburn	[] or so don't know how it is in ruby
 blackburn	:)
 serialhex	nope, same error as before with traindna = ["ACTG\n", "TGCA\n"]
 blackburn	wrong number??
 blackburn	hmm
 serialhex	also w/o the newlines it dosnt work...
 serialhex	so i'm thinking the typemap...
 blackburn	serialhex: so [] things doesn't work anyhow?
 serialhex	nope, apparently not
 blackburn	serialhex: so what returns load_dna ?
 blackburn	[] too
 blackburn	serialhex: okay sorry but it is 4-35 there already :) I have to sleep
 serialhex	["GAGACGGACCGTATGGGCAGGAT",
 serialhex	 "GCGCATATTGTAGAGTATGGAGG",
 serialhex	... and so on
 blackburn	hmm wait
 serialhex	ok, np... i'll e-mail sonney2k & sploving
 blackburn	so how can ["ACTG", "TACG"] doesn't
 blackburn	work
 blackburn	but ^ do?
 serialhex	it dosnt
 serialhex	none of them work
 blackburn	serialhex: I mean when you use load_dna it have different error about alphabet?
 blackburn	but if shorter ACTG version it says about wrong num of argz
 serialhex	nope, when it's not in an array i get a different error, but when it's in an array i get the: [ERROR] ALPHABET too small to contain all symbols in histogram
 blackburn	can't understand the difference between load_dna result and []
 serialhex	with or without newlines
 serialhex	load_dna result is a longer array
 blackburn	serialhex: so will ["ACTG", "TACG"] produce alphabet error?
 serialhex	yes
 serialhex	and so will ["ACTG\n", "TGCA\n"]
 blackburn	serialhex: how many histogram elements there are with "ACTG" ?
 blackburn	5?
 serialhex	2 it says
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	hist[] =
 blackburn	how many records of this form ^
 blackburn	?
 serialhex	hist[0]=2
 serialhex	hist[65]=2
 serialhex	hist[67]=2
 serialhex	hist[71]=2
 serialhex	hist[84]=2
 blackburn	5
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	and with ACTG\n?
 serialhex	hist[0]=2
 serialhex	hist[10]=2
 serialhex	hist[65]=2
 serialhex	hist[67]=2
 serialhex	hist[71]=2
 serialhex	hist[84]=2
 blackburn	serialhex: I have a fix but you probably have to recompile
 serialhex	ok... i should prob do that anyway with the latest :P
 blackburn	serialhex: can you please gist script you used for ^?
 serialhex	yes
 serialhex	https://gist.github.com/1fe53c321c001132e6c4
 serialhex	thats the latest v of the file & error
 blackburn	compiling
 blackburn	serialhex: the problem is for some *STRANGE* reason baozeng copies len+1 of string chars
 blackburn	in "in" typemap
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	serialhex: so ACTG is something 6567718400
 serialhex	ok, sounds like a fun error :P

 blackburn	serialhex: got wrong number of args..
 serialhex	hmm... really?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	strange
 serialhex	yes, it is :-/
 blackburn	serialhex: w/o \n produces wrong number of args
 blackburn	w/ - alphabet error
 serialhex	well, get to bed, i'll e-mail sonney2k & sploving about it and maybe we can come up with something?
 serialhex	huh...
 serialhex	i dunno :(
 blackburn	serialhex: let they know that string takes *one* char more than needed
 blackburn	it is pretty certain
 serialhex	ok, will do
 blackburn	but no fix yet
 blackburn	okay 5-06 time to sleep ahah

@sonney2k	serialhex, seems like the NULL is in the string
 serialhex	ahh, ok
@sonney2k	guess the fix is trivial
@sonney2k	just not use len+1 in the typemap but len
 serialhex	ok cool

@sonney2k	serialhex, did you make some progress on examples?
 serialhex	i've got a bunch... i think like10-20 or something?  a lot of them just won't work though
 serialhex	...like the preprocesor examples, i can't find the modules :-/
@sonney2k	serialhex, what happens?
 serialhex	well, like preprocessor_hessianlocallylinearembedding_modular.rb, i can't find a Modshogun::Hessian* anything....
@sonney2k	serialhex, then you don't have atlas/blas/lapack installed
 serialhex	ahh, ok
 serialhex	where is that in debian?  just apt-get atlas??
@sonney2k	do apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev
@sonney2k	then recompile and then it will work
 serialhex	ok, recompiling...  my machine is slow so i'll know later in the am
@sonney2k	serialhex, btw we had the same issue w/ '\0' being in the string in other $LANG
@sonney2k	so I am pretty sure that this fixes
@sonney2k	it
 serialhex	ahh, ok...
 serialhex	i'll let you know tomorrow
 serialhex	or later today :P
@sonney2k	the script you had first should work - the one where you add '\n' won't
 serialhex	ok

@sonney2k	heiko, hi!
 heiko	sonney2k, hi
 heiko	dont worry I will finish the migration soon
@sonney2k	how is it going?
 heiko	fine here, what about you?
@sonney2k	ok, so soon means hours or days?
 heiko	It is already working, I am trying out some more examples to eliminate some possible bugs
 heiko	One thing sucks: I forgot my Laptop power cable at home and my remaining time is only 30mins
 heiko	I think I will send a pull request tomorrow
@sonney2k	it would be optimal if we could try to work on the migrations this evening
@sonney2k	uh
 heiko	then we will have to add the migraion methods to each class that has a changed parameter
@sonney2k	yes - I would have wished to start that tonight if you are that far already
@sonney2k	we have only 2 days before the intended release data so time is pressing a bit now
 heiko	yes true
 heiko	mmh, I have some urgent stuff to do this evening, I will move out of my flat on friday and nothing is done yet
 heiko	Lets do it like this
@sonney2k	so if you have an example that shows how to use migrations and your migrations don't break anything I would like to merge even sooner
 heiko	I will go home now and work there offline
@sonney2k	ok
 heiko	then I will put a "pull"-able  patch together
 heiko	and come to university this evening to send it
@sonney2k	or internet cafe or so
 heiko	yes, but its not far away from here
@sonney2k	k
 heiko	I think it should work pretty fine
 heiko	at least for numerical stuff
@sonney2k	would be great - we have everything running now http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/waterfall
@sonney2k	(all examples work)
 heiko	the most important parts are the actual migrate methods, which have to be written by hand for each changed parameter
 heiko	cool
@sonney2k	and documentations is also updated http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah but we didn't do *huge* changes
@sonney2k	mostly additions
@sonney2k	or sgvector replacement
 heiko	yes, I am trying that out in the moment
@sonney2k	so if you have an example on how to ignore new things / sgvector stuff then we should be able to get the old test suite to work
 heiko	the map stuff works and also recursively replacing parameters using the migrate method
 heiko	ok, I will do that now and then send a patch this evening
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	thanks
 heiko	I will be here working on it tomorrow before noon also
 heiko	Ok then, see you this evening
@sonney2k	so there is a chance we can do it

 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	in the evening already
 blackburn	any other news?
@sonney2k	so we might give the transitions a shot
@sonney2k	more c# examples
@sonney2k	from daniel
 blackburn	I'm pretty busy today with all the moving to samara from my home
@sonney2k	when are you leaving?
 blackburn	already in samar
 blackburn	a
@sonney2k	ahh
 blackburn	so now unpacking aha
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	gzip -d
 blackburn	will do something with examples or so this night
@sonney2k	blackburn, hopefully you have some time tonight - maybe we can get the first few migration related things to work
@sonney2k	if things run smoothly - then we are good
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw octave is broken on the buildbot (still) so tests related to it might be a bit unreliable...

 heiko	argh found another error
@sonney2k	kk
 heiko	ok scalars work now

 heiko	remeber that "treated in the same way as scalar variables" thing?

 heiko	i got problems with these new container types
 heiko	CT_SGVECTOR etc
 heiko	but I just thought of a way how to handle it
@sonney2k	ok
 heiko	it will do it for SGVector for now
 heiko	then you can have a look before i do the other ones
 heiko	this is getting more and more complicated
 heiko	but at least: scalars work :)
 heiko	type changes, name changes, no changes - everything

 heiko	sonney2k, sorry the sgvector migration leads to a bunch of new problems
 heiko	i will not finish this today
@sonney2k	 what problems?
 heiko	copying Tparameter instances (with their data) is complicated with these types
 heiko	every time, an SGVector has to be allocated, along with its data
 heiko	and this has to be done when migrating
 heiko	I am currently changing the migration method to be able to use already allocated data
 heiko	sorry that this takes so long, but the stuff is even more complicated than the model selection stuff
 heiko	sonney2k, I gotta go now, my girlfriend is killing me already, we have to clear up our flat. I will be back tomorrow morning and continue
@sonney2k	hmmhh seems like the problem is more w/ this SGVector stuff
 heiko	yes
 heiko	normaly it is easy to create a new TParameter instance
 heiko	simply copy the m_parameter memory
@sonney2k	if we 'just' had double* stuff it would work I guess
 heiko	but with SGVector this is not possible like this
@sonney2k	but can't you do the same thing with the SGVector stuff?
@sonney2k	you just say a=b
 heiko	no, the m_parameter field contains a vector
 heiko	this has to be copied
 heiko	but also the ->vector field
@sonney2k	the vector has to be copied too?
@sonney2k	not just the ptr?
 heiko	currently, yes
 heiko	but i will change this
 heiko	also, a=b only works if the types are clear
@sonney2k	ptr should be sufficient
@sonney2k	a=b is the same like memccpy in our case
@sonney2k	do you copy the double* ptr's or do you copy memory for that too?
 heiko	memory too
 heiko	but i will change it
@sonney2k	ok that definitely needs to be changed
 heiko	when a parameter does not change from one version to next one
 heiko	yes
@sonney2k	doesn't make sense to copy memory around
 heiko	work in progress...
 heiko	it is there because of this:
 heiko	when a migration is performed, a type may change or something else may happen with the data
 heiko	so that is cannot be used, but has to be converted somehow
 heiko	in this case, migrate returns a new TParameter instance (with allocated memory) with the converted data
 heiko	and this data has to be deleted afterwards (because of multiple migration steps)
 heiko	i did this as a first step
 heiko	and then noticed that sometimes, data does not get changed
@sonney2k	I would say one should assume that things that are migrated from have to stay constant
 heiko	in this case, no copy has to be returned, but also this stuff must not be deleted afterwords
@sonney2k	and the things we migrate to might have to be clones
 heiko	yes, thats how i want to do it
 heiko	but just realised it
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	yeah it seems really much more involved than I ever imagined
 heiko	yes, its complicated stuff
@sonney2k	what is important now is that we get something to work good enough for the initial migration
 heiko	yes
@sonney2k	we can polish this later on I would say
@sonney2k	current migrations aren't too difficult - so it shouldn't be too hard
 heiko	yes, but the infrastructure has to be capable of more complex migrations so that we avoid doing all this stuff all over again in the next release
@sonney2k	that is true
 heiko	but is has not to be implemented yet
 heiko	sonney2k, I will go for it tomorrow and hopefully it will go then, I have the feeling that "it will work soon" for quite some time now
@sonney2k	yeah that's not goo
@sonney2k	d
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	thanks!
@sonney2k	apologies to your gf
 heiko	 :) thanks
 heiko	so cu
