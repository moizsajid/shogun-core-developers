@wiking	any blockers?

 OXPHOS	wiking: so
 OXPHOS	wiking: I did http://pastebin.com/KK4TLJNU in init.h
 OXPHOS	wiking: theoretically all macros are redefined right?
 OXPHOS	wiking: I mean I can just use cereal_save instead of save across shogun right?
@wiking	common.h
@wiking	but
@wiking	#ifdef CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME
@wiking	#undef CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME
@wiking	#define CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME cereal_save
@wiking	#endif
@wiking	i would do
@wiking	#ifdef CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME
@wiking	#undef CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME
@wiking	#endif
@wiking	#define CEREAL_SAVE_FUNCTION_NAME cereal_save
@wiking	because you always want to define that macro
@wiking	no?
 OXPHOS	you're right
 OXPHOS	I just found out I need to include the file in unittest to enable the macro
 OXPHOS	or actually macros.hpp is undefined in unittest

@wiking	HeikoS, yo
@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@wiking	HeikoS, have you seen the new feature branch
@wiking	?:)
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yolo
 lisitsyn	yolo
 lisitsyn	yolo
 sanuj	lisitsyn, got time ??
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yolo
 sanuj	:D
 lisitsyn	a bit
 sanuj	did you see the PR?
 lisitsyn	noah yet
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i need to talk about what to do next?
@wiking	y0000000000000000LO
@wiking	lisitsyn, the yolo is this
@wiking	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/feature/javascript
@wiking	:)
@wiking	sanuj, dont you wanna spend some time with clang-format ? :)
 lisitsyn	JAVASCRIPT?
 lisitsyn	lol
@wiking	since the indentation of you code is usually messed up... that way you would get the autoformatting
@wiking	lisitsyn, javascript modular interface
 lisitsyn	ok why not
 lisitsyn	wiking: nodjes?
@wiking	already have a shogun-ml npm package
@wiking	:)))
 lisitsyn	oh why fucking not
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn, because think about it
@wiking	lisitsyn, runtime speed of python vs v8
@wiking	?
@wiking	what's your guess?
 lisitsyn	v8 is like
 lisitsyn	C++
@wiking	so dont you think that actually it would make much more sense
@wiking	to do data science in JS (or ecma6) instead of python?
@wiking	i mean it's a scripting language
@wiking	easy to prototype etc
@wiking	but still the runtime is much better...
@wiking	and with ecmascript6 you have a lot of nice abstractions
@wiking	or with typescript you have even types :)
@wiking	HeikoS, ^
@wiking	i'm trying to reach out to #scijs people
@wiking	to have the array/features mapping defined nicely with ndarray that they are maitaining
 lisitsyn	sanuj: do tests work now?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i have commented in the PR
 sanuj	wait
 sanuj	wiking, okay
@wiking	sanuj, i can give you something as a starter
 sanuj	lisitsyn, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3370#discussion-diff-72404899R124
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I don't really see how can it compare them
 lisitsyn	they're slightly different in implementations
 sanuj	okay, i'll remove this test
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i can take care of the rest of the tests then
 lisitsyn	yupp
 sanuj	lisitsyn,  I think we should establish a way to add plugins in shogun and think of how to start migrating.
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so what do you think?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, wiking suggested that a shogun plugin can be an entirely new repository also
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i had mailed you about this a few days before
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I don't think we need to split repositories now
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so what should be the next step here for the plugins PR?
 sanuj	do we need anything else before we merge this?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: make tests work and fix indentation ;)
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	wiking: checking
@HeikoS	+1 fore js
@HeikoS	Is that a lot of work?
@wiking	mmm slowly steadily
@wiking	why?
@wiking	now it at least compiles
@HeikoS	just wondering
@wiking	needs some tests etc
@wiking	for optimal version of course it needs some work
@HeikoS	typemaps yet missing
@wiking	(having the proper memory wrappers, so not to copy mem etc)
@wiking	yep
@wiking	exactely
@wiking	wanna talk first with the #scijs guys
@wiking	before jumping on that
@wiking	anyhow wondering how to extend the metastuff :)
@HeikoS	okok
@HeikoS	meta examples?
@HeikoS	thats easy
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	just need a new target.json
@HeikoS	that is the dictionary that maps a syntax tree to the target language
@HeikoS	simple text replacement
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	ok i'll try to look into it
 sanuj	i'm getting github unicorn
@wiking	sanuj, check status.github.com
@wiking	maybe it has a hiccup now
@wiking	seems like
@HeikoS	wiking: I can help with that,
@wiking	HeikoS, would be cool
@HeikoS	but we need typemaps first otherwise it will just fail
@wiking	HeikoS, i've put together an npm package even
@HeikoS	nice one
@wiking	nono it's ok
@wiking	i mean the typemap i'm working on
@wiking	but dunno when i can finish
@wiking	but imagine on the end
@wiking	having nodejs running this
@wiking	with the d3js frontend
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	Ill do the meta ones then
@wiking	cool
@wiking	as that way i can even test stuff
@HeikoS	yeah exactly
@HeikoS	though!
@HeikoS	we currently only do integration testing from cpp meta examples
@HeikoS	would be cool to make that work for all of them
@HeikoS	since then we implicitly test typemaps
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	wiking: gs
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jo!
@wiking	HeikoS, i'm there
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: jolo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jo
@HeikoS	so what about meta integration testing across all modular targets?
@HeikoS	not just cpp
@HeikoS	remember the issue?
@wiking	lisitsyn, elixir-lang.org/

 OXPHOS	leagoetz: hey lea! sorry I cannot reply PM somehow
 leagoetz	oh hey
 leagoetz	just wanted to remind you that you need to wrap up this week, as from next week the focus should be on polishing/merging PRs
 leagoetz	also ... have you updated your timeline?
 leagoetz	;P
 sanuj	link to the meeting: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/irclogs/%23shogun.2016-07-18.log.html
 leagoetz	yes, yes sanuj, it's all there and the time to do it has come :)
 sanuj	leagoetz, sure sure
 OXPHOS	leagoetz: sure thanks! yes I did around midterm
 leagoetz	and it's staying like this?
 leagoetz	that's fine then - make sure you can achieve everything that's on there.
 sanuj	leagoetz, you work on neurons stuff? :D
 leagoetz	yes, neurons stuff
 leagoetz	haha
 sanuj	leagoetz, so what exactly?
 sanuj	i like to chat with phds about their research
 leagoetz	I try to understand what computation individual neurons are performing
 sanuj	leagoetz, how do you do it?
 sanuj	with fMRI?
 lisitsyn	STACK MORE LAYERS %))))
 sanuj	some other imaging technique
 leagoetz	no, fMRI does not have high enough resolution
 sanuj	lisitsyn, that's for deep learning
 lisitsyn	yes just stack more layers!
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, haha
 leagoetz	I do a combination of experiments and biophysical modelling
 sanuj	lisitsyn, residual networks
 lisitsyn	more layers
 leagoetz	well, in some sense individual neurons also stack more layers
 lisitsyn	more more layers
 sanuj	lisitsyn, need some time to discuss about my timeline
 lisitsyn	relu relu layer norm
* lisitsyn away
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	when does gsoc end?
 leagoetz	internal deadline 16 aug
 lisitsyn	sanuj: I think you have to stay a few more years to complete plugins
 leagoetz	external 23
 lisitsyn	sorry about that! :D
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	i won't be able to do gsoc
 sanuj	as i won't be a student
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but i'll stay ;)
 leagoetz	yes, nice! :)
 lisitsyn	yeah you have to
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	leagoetz, do you have a blog or something for your research?
 leagoetz	nope, too lazy
 leagoetz	you can check out our lab website
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	https://www.ucl.ac.uk/wibr/research/circuit-neuroscience
 leagoetz	http://michael-hausser.squarespace.com
 lisitsyn	train more linear models on hadoop
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i'm telling you, deep learning will eat everything
 sanuj	:D
 lisitsyn	no chance
 lisitsyn	we gonna drop that sheatz at some point :P
 sanuj	only the umbrella term "deep learning" will have more techniques under it
 lisitsyn	the winter is coming
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	it is I feel the breeze
 leagoetz	oh dear, it's finally summer here and you talk about winter coming
 sanuj	leagoetz, thanks for the website link
 lisitsyn	summer, is it like +15C there in uk?
 lisitsyn	and 90% cloudy?
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	it was 40C here a few days ago
 sanuj	not it's 28C due to monsoon
 leagoetz	yes, exact description ;D
 sanuj	haha
 leagoetz	summer means, I don't wear my winter coat for clycling to uni
 lisitsyn	I wouldn't be able to move if it is 40C outside
 leagoetz	there is only about 2 months of the year where this is possible
 leagoetz	July is one of them
 sanuj	lisitsyn, haha, it's not good
 leagoetz	28 due to monsoon is still a bit crazy
 sanuj	leagoetz, what is summer temp in london?
 sanuj	18-19C
 leagoetz	anything over 15 deg celsius
 lisitsyn	I've seen some british people in spain
 sanuj	i see
 lisitsyn	they get really crazy
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	I guess that's how they feel about > +15C
 sanuj	haha
 leagoetz	British people abroad ... the only thing worse than British people in Britain ;)
 lisitsyn	I had so much fun they're watching football all the time :D
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you like football?
 lisitsyn	well it is fun to play but not really fun to watch
 sanuj	i used to watch
 sanuj	now stopped
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so here is the deal
 lisitsyn	yeah at some age you stop that
 sanuj	i need to open all new PRs this week
 lisitsyn	I guess because you realize you can't spend your life on such bs
 lisitsyn	:D
 sanuj	from next week i can only improve them and get them merge
 lisitsyn	sanuj: uhm ok
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	lets merge
 lisitsyn	this thing
 lisitsyn	make tests work and indents!
 sanuj	yeah, i'm adding more tests
 sanuj	will be done before tonight
 sanuj	lisitsyn, but what else do you think i can work on
 sanuj	like open new PRs this week
 lisitsyn	sanuj: we also need to merge Jinja
 sanuj	yeah but get() bug is messy
 lisitsyn	with swig
 sanuj	if the function has get(), i think it errors
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ok lets think of other name maybe
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	fetch is not good i guess :P
 lisitsyn	no
 sanuj	leagoetz, one of the brain related blogs i read sometimes, https://neuroconscience.com/
 sanuj	this guy is also at UCL i guess
 lisitsyn	sanuj: set is also bad
 lisitsyn	uhmm we need better pair
 sanuj	ooohkayy
 sanuj	lisitsyn, set is too common
 leagoetz	looks like it
 lisitsyn	leagoetz: help us
 lisitsyn	;)
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and HeikoS suggested to hack SG_ADD
 lisitsyn	we need alternative to set/get
 sanuj	these are function names ^
 leagoetz	put/gut
 leagoetz	:)
 lisitsyn	lol
 lisitsyn	put
 lisitsyn	hmm
 lisitsyn	pull/put
 lisitsyn	not good for api
 lisitsyn	I'd get mad
 leagoetz	take/make
 leagoetz	but I guess make is not the best either
 lisitsyn	ok we can use some suffix/prefix for set/get
 lisitsyn	aset aget
 lisitsyn	sets gets
 lisitsyn	set_ get_
 leagoetz	doset doget
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i think get* will error with SWIG
 lisitsyn	why?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, will have to try
 lisitsyn	aset/aget is actually used
 lisitsyn	in clojurescript
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	crazy
 sanuj	haha
 lisitsyn	setr/getr
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i will try set/get suffix and prefix names
 lisitsyn	I like setr getr most at the moment
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, what about hacking SG_ADD or something else
 lisitsyn	we need to do that
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	may be I'll try to get some time on weekend
 sanuj	i think we should have an example for how to convert old shogun class to support tags-parameters
 lisitsyn	sanuj: if we have SG_ADD all of them are already converted
 lisitsyn	sanuj: sets gets is better!
 lisitsyn	lets go with sets/gets
 lisitsyn	wiking: HeikoS: ho
 lisitsyn	we have tough decision there!
 sanuj	okay....
 lisitsyn	sanuj: a few reasons
 lisitsyn	1) it would work with set<Tab>
 lisitsyn	2) it looks like a bit of proper english
 sanuj	lisitsyn, set<Tab>
 lisitsyn	autocompletino
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	yes, it's proper english
 sanuj	lisitsyn, if we hack SG_ADD and merge it, will we be able to delete Parameter.h etc
 lisitsyn	not sure
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-210-120.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so shall i try to change a shogun class to use tags-parameter with old parameter framework
 sanuj	and then move on to hacking sg_add
 lisitsyn	which shogun class?
 sanuj	any class
 sanuj	just to see if it works (it should work)
 lisitsyn	yeah it makes sense to try
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-210-120.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	not sure we should commit that tho
 sanuj	yeah, won't commit
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so i'll start these two PRs tomorrow
 sanuj	do we need to start any new PR apart from these two for tags?
 lisitsyn	probably no
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and for plugins?
 sanuj	new PR after the current one?
 lisitsyn	the deadline is quite soon so lets just polish these
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and how do we add classes in the jinja template
 sanuj	for base-shogun
 lisitsyn	don't get it
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-210-120.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we need to list the base-shogun in jinja template
 sanuj	lisitsyn, i mean, we need to list the classes for base-shogun in jinja template
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	so?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, so we need to decide what classes to list in that
 lisitsyn	oh ok
 sanuj	or will we merge without the full list?
 lisitsyn	impossible
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	yeah merge w/o full list
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, thanks!
 sanuj	leaving for dinner now
 lisitsyn	okk
@wiking	?

-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-210-120.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	wiking: gets/sets
 lisitsyn	how do you like it
 lisitsyn	instead of get/set
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-210-120.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Client Quit]
@wiking	lisitsyn, why the diff?
@wiking	i mean i dont really think there's an awful big diff
@wiking	so if it's easier to have gets/sets instead of get/set
@wiking	then lets' have it like that
@wiking	because actually semantically speaking (+english grammar) dictates gets/sets :D
 lisitsyn	wiking: no actually it is get set
 lisitsyn	like wiking set x to 3
 lisitsyn	but yeah
@wiking	no
 lisitsyn	if it solves the problem
@wiking	wiking sets x to 3
@wiking	in english :)
@wiking	but if set is easier
@wiking	then let's go with that
@wiking	either way
@wiking	i dont see it as a big problem
@wiking	both 'makes' sense
@wiking	or you can sell the idea :D
