 Hieronymous	How do I edit the public wiki ?
 Hieronymous	When I make changes to the wiki on my local machine, I'm unable to push it on GitHub.
 Hieronymous	The doc/wiki folder is untracked.
 Saurabh7	Hieronymous: maybe here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-wiki
 Hieronymous	Saurabh7: The wiki has its own separate fork. Weird.
 Hieronymous	I was unable to edit the markdown files that were in the SHOGUN repo.

@HeikoS	Hieronymous: see that issue 3542
@HeikoS	other people have the same issue so a readme would be great

 Hieronymous	It is "untracked".
@HeikoS	untracked?
 Hieronymous	I made the changes in the Developer wiki.
@HeikoS	ah cool, send a pull request
 Hieronymous	But I can't seem to push it, since its untracked.
 Hieronymous	modified:   doc/wiki (modified content, untracked content)
 Hieronymous	This is what I get, while trying to push it.
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	you need to fork the wiki repo
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-wiki
@HeikoS	then clone your fork
@HeikoS	make changes
@HeikoS	push to your fork, send a pull request
 Hieronymous	Oh, Okay. Great, Got it :)
@HeikoS	you cannot push to the  submodule , only devs can
 Hieronymous	You can review the other PRs till then :) Great, got it.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: So you want me to add this somehow to the Tapkee notebook then ?
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: yes
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: no need to create a new one
 Hieronymous	Sure, I will add them in the end then.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: check out some of the more sophisticated notebooks for inspiration on how to structure it
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: needs some polishing, some love in the presentation
@HeikoS	otherwise its good
@HeikoS	ill comment more
 Hieronymous	I would, I actually saw the Tapkee notebook. Meanwhile, can you suggest me some issue other than "doc fix/notebook".
 Hieronymous	I will keep adding docs and notebooks, but something to better understand SHOGUN would be great ?
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: depends on what you are after
@HeikoS	shogun has  a lot of stuff
@HeikoS	framework design, numerical algos, cmake build, docs, examples
@HeikoS	maybe port a meta example
@HeikoS	thats nice
@HeikoS	we had our gsoc students do twice a week
 Hieronymous	C++ coding would be nice. "Port a meta example". Any discussion thread etc on this.
 Hieronymous	I will take a look then.
@HeikoS	Read the readme of the cookbook
@HeikoS	doc/cookbook
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20cookbook
@HeikoS	examle cookbook patches that are merged
@HeikoS	you can do this in two ways
@HeikoS	either your just port a python example to the meta language (easy and quick)
@HeikoS	and optionally you can write a cookbook page, like in the example patches
@HeikoS	this way you learn about our integration testing
@HeikoS	and about multiple interfaces shogun has
@HeikoS	and how to execute things
@HeikoS	as usual: any contribution to the readme is really welcome, especially since you have an outsiders view and can very easily point out what is confusing
@HeikoS	the cookbooks are quite cool btw
@HeikoS	see "examples" on shogun.ml
 Hieronymous	Perfect, I will go through these then. Yep one thing which is intimidating in SHOGUN for noobs is "lack of docs"
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: yeah, so thats the most useful thing to do then :)
 Hieronymous	Apart from that the fact that C++ isn't really beginner friendly like Python

 Hieronymous	HeikoS: I see that there isn't a cookbook example for MultiTaskLogistic Regression.
 Hieronymous	So I will add one then.

 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Any hints ? Just the general procedure on how should I go about adding cookbook examples.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: thanks for the wiki patch, I commented
@HeikoS	really useful
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: just take any python example, and translate it to meta
@HeikoS	doing it similar to those example that are already there (naming, style etc)
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: as the cookbook readme says, porting an example is just creating one file
@HeikoS	and adding a cookbook page on the website requires a second file
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: The cookbook actually doesn't have a README. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/doc/cookbook
 Hieronymous	Any details on how to create the ".sg" example. I am assuming that is how you create the meta example.

 Hieronymous	HeikoS: There aren't any docs in the doc/cookbook. Should I add one, explaining how to go about creating one ?
 Hieronymous	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/doc/cookbook
 Hieronymous	*creating a cookbook that is.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: hi again
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: still questions?
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Having dinner. You available for the next few hours ?
 Hieronymous	Yep, The cookbook actually doesn't have a README. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/develop/doc/cookbook
@HeikoS	I wil be here for another hour or so
 Hieronymous	I am thinking I will create a cookbook for ID3 decision tree of thats fine.
@HeikoS	There is one
@HeikoS	in doc/readme
@HeikoS	EXAMPLES.MD
 Hieronymous	Oh, I will take a look then.
 Hieronymous	ID3 decision tree cookbook fine ? There isn't one last I checked .
@HeikoS	There might be an open PR
@HeikoS	cooler would be one of the other algos
@HeikoS	metric learning for example
@HeikoS	ICA
@HeikoS	PCA
@HeikoS	sparse GPs
@HeikoS	you know
@HeikoS	the cool stuff
@HeikoS	not id3, that's a bit lame ;)
 Hieronymous	Haha, HeikoS: Sure , I am aware of PCA, yep ID3 is pretty simple, hence my reason for choosing. I will do one of the ones you mentioned.
@HeikoS	I mean
@HeikoS	even if you dont understand what is going on
@HeikoS	porting the example itself
@HeikoS	is copy paste kind of work
@HeikoS	so you dont need a lot for that
@HeikoS	for writing the text, maybe a bit more
@HeikoS	but I can help with that
