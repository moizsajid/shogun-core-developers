 yorkerlin	 I guess the issue is realted to the linear algebra lib.
 yorkerlin	according to the travis' report 95 - unit-GaussianProcessRegression (Failed)  218 - unit-FITCInferenceMethod (Failed)  228 - unit-SingleFITCLaplacianInferenceMethod (Failed)
 yorkerlin	I re-run the test. I am sure that the failed tests are NOT that same because last time the failed tests were 28,218, and 228.
 yorkerlin	the bug may come from the GaussianARDKernel.

 pickle27	heyo
 pickle27	@sonney2k are you around?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: hey!
 pickle27	hey!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: how is it going?
 pickle27	not too bad, you?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: got back from your country a week ago ;)
 lisitsyn	so fine
 pickle27	oh yeah? where were ya?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I guess you need sonney2k for the website?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: we've (heiko, soeren) been to montreal
 lisitsyn	to visit nips
 pickle27	yeah Heiko wants to ship it
 pickle27	ahh I didn't realize that was in Montreal
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	pickle27: so iirc you had some access issue?
 lisitsyn	like it is running in other user?
 pickle27	I dont really know how the server is setup and I don't really want to mess with it
 pickle27	I'd rather whoever owns it sets up my process and copy access to I can update the site when I need to
 lisitsyn	okay I see
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I am a fan of git deployment
 pickle27	its not that much work I just need to sync up with him
 lisitsyn	do you think we can just set up a remote
 pickle27	yeah thats how I would like it
 lisitsyn	like in heroku
 lisitsyn	ah you also have procfile
 lisitsyn	ahhh you're running it on heroku indeed
 pickle27	yeah thats where it is now
 pickle27	but I think we want it moved to our server
 lisitsyn	yes sure
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ok as you're a bit rare at irc I'll try to catch up with soeren for that
 pickle27	yeah if you catch him that would be great
 lisitsyn	I actually can do that by myself but I guess I don't have access now
 lisitsyn	pickle27: does it work locally?
 pickle27	yeah the site works locally
 pickle27	there is no db so its pretty easy
 pickle27	run ./scriptserver
 pickle27	err /script/server
 lisitsyn	yeah got it
 lisitsyn	installing things atm
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ImportError: No module named github
 lisitsyn	what's the pip for that?
 lisitsyn	ahh you have requirements sorry
 lisitsyn	nvm
 lisitsyn	:)
 pickle27	there is /script/setup as well
 pickle27	cause I always forget how to actually use requirements
 lisitsyn	pip install -r!
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	KeyError: 'DEV'
 lisitsyn	oops
 lisitsyn	I guess we need to check
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web2/pull/30/files
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ^
 lisitsyn	ok good I've run it
 pickle27	do you have merge or do you need me to?
 lisitsyn	pickle27: just merged
 pickle27	sweet!
 lisitsyn	pickle27: ok so we want
 lisitsyn	git-based pushing
 lisitsyn	so it deploys on shogun-toolbox.org
 pickle27	the dev flag is there to toggle between reading notebooks in the web repo or outside it like our current site does
 lisitsyn	yeah
 pickle27	but honestly I think it might be better if we purposely include notebooks in the site instead
 pickle27	cause I remember a few times that notebook creation was broken and it affected the site
 pickle27	there might be a flask deploy lib
 lisitsyn	hmm what does it do?
 lisitsyn	I think we can just add something to post-commit hook or whatever
 pickle27	yeah essentially that
 pickle27	this post looks decent
 pickle27	https://realpython.com/blog/python/kickstarting-flask-on-ubuntu-setup-and-deployment/
 lisitsyn	pickle27: is fabric the thing?
 lisitsyn	you're talking about
 pickle27	nah - I just meant look into what is out there as someone may have made something for this.
 lisitsyn	ah ok ok
 pickle27	so it might be
 lisitsyn	pickle27: so I think I can take care of that
 pickle27	awesome
 lisitsyn	pickle27: I will try to ping soeren tomorrow so he can give me enough access
