 alesis-novik	Good day

 VojtechFranc	hi alesis
 alesis-novik	Hello VojtechFranc
 VojtechFranc	I prepared Matlab implementation of the GMM-EM algorithm plus some examples.
 alesis-novik	can you send it over email? I'll have a look at it
 VojtechFranc	It is a small Matlab toolbox. you can install it from SVN: svn co http://ptak.felk.cvut.cz/datagrid/svn/stprtool/
 VojtechFranc	username is stprtool, no pasword
 VojtechFranc	the algorithms relevant to your work are in the folder "probab"
 VojtechFranc	there are functions for deadling with the GMM and the EM algorithm itself
 VojtechFranc	there are also few examples of usage on systhetical 1d and 2d data
 VojtechFranc	in addition there is one example using the GMM-EM algorithm to train OCR classifier on USPS database
 alesis-novik	I'll have a look at it then.
 VojtechFranc	Great! Do not hasiate to ask questions.
 VojtechFranc	Curently there is a basic implementation of the EM which you shoul re-implement to C++.
 VojtechFranc	There a few differneces compared to textbook implementaion of GMM-EM.
 VojtechFranc	1) the covariance matrix is represented in decomposed form which is uself fo several reasons (speed, numerical stability, ...)
 VojtechFranc	2) Most of the computations are done in log domain which is more robust
 VojtechFranc	3) there is a kind of regularization (namely, bound on the minimal variance) which makes the log-likelihood problem well posed
 VojtechFranc	In the time before you start implementing, you could try to get familiar with the code.
 alesis-novik	so log domain deals with high/low numbers and regularization deals with singular Gaussians then?
 VojtechFranc	Do you need to recomend some literature on EM ? I think it would be necessary only if you are not familiar with the EM
 VojtechFranc	yes, exactly
 VojtechFranc	if we have time, I'd like you to implement other imporvements: like merge/split rules etc.
 alesis-novik	I've studied EM from C. M. Bishops "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", so I think I know the general theory behind it
 VojtechFranc	yes, this should be enough
 VojtechFranc	you can ask me if you find something strange in the code
 VojtechFranc	but it should not be difficult
 alesis-novik	merge/split would be dynamically changing number of components?
 VojtechFranc	exactly
 VojtechFranc	it is useful to avoid some "bad" local maxima of the log-likelihood
 VojtechFranc	and to remove gaussian components not supported by enough data
 alesis-novik	So it would be a more robust way of dealing with singular Gaussians than minimal variance as well
 VojtechFranc	No, it does not improve robustness.
 VojtechFranc	It makes the model more meaningfull (by removing the singular components) and helps to escape some local maxima
 alesis-novik	I think I should have time to implement that
 VojtechFranc	it would be nice. However, let us proceed gradually: i) implementing the basic version, ii) testing/ debuggin and iii) implementing other improvements
 alesis-novik	well, I guess the *very* basic version is already there
 VojtechFranc	by basic I mean the one I sent you
 VojtechFranc	it would be also nice if you implement some demosntation scripts
 VojtechFranc	both toy examples and close to some real application
 VojtechFranc	this will require some graphical output
 VojtechFranc	do you prefer Matlab to Python or something else?
 alesis-novik	I think I would prefer Matlab, though I can't really use it from home. I'm not really that good at Python though.
 VojtechFranc	great, I also prefer Matlab
 alesis-novik	Like I said, the only problem is that I can't really do Matlab because I can only use it in the University
 VojtechFranc	Then decide what is better for you. I can use Python as well.
 alesis-novik	I assume I can do the demonstration scripts at the end, after doing the implementation?
 VojtechFranc	Yes, but it is useful to have at least some simple example which you can used during development
 VojtechFranc	like some synthetic data where you can visualized the found model to see whether the estimate makes a sense ...
 VojtechFranc	the code I sent you contains such examples
 alesis-novik	I wonder if R could be used for this?
 VojtechFranc	no idea, I know nothing about R.
 VojtechFranc	As I said I would prefer i) Matlab or ii) Python or iii) Octave
 VojtechFranc	So, that's it from my side. I'll have to disconnect soon.
 VojtechFranc	Please, go though the code and don't hasitate to send me an email if you meet any problem.
 alesis-novik	Hmm, Octave looks quite similar to Matlab, and given that it's not going to be used for computation, just visualization, it might port to Matlab easily
 alesis-novik	So the implementation should also have an input parameter where you can specify if the cov is "full" "diag" or "spherical"?
 VojtechFranc	I thing the same holds for Matlab and python - they will be used just for visualization
 VojtechFranc	the code will be in C++
 VojtechFranc	in the shogun library linked to the corresponding environment
 alesis-novik	But I can't really use Matlab from where I'll be developing this and I'm not too comfortable with Python. I think I'll deal with this issue when time comes
 VojtechFranc	ok, think about other alternatives
 alesis-novik	so about the covariance types, I should use the 3 used in the Matlab code, correct?
 VojtechFranc	for now yes, in the future I'd like to ask other options lake the Factor Analysis Decomposition etc
 VojtechFranc	it sould not be problem to add other representations if the code is well implemented
 alesis-novik	I'll think about separating different parts so they can be expanded on later
 VojtechFranc	great, the code I sent you might give you an inspiration beause it allows simple extensions
 VojtechFranc	unfortunatelly, I need to go now. Shell we agree on another chat (besides emails) ?
 alesis-novik	I think we can agree on it over the emails. I'll probably only have time to analyse the Matlab code during the next 2 weeks because of my exams
 VojtechFranc	yes, of course. Let's communicate via emails.
 alesis-novik	When the actual coding starts we could have weekly talks or so
 VojtechFranc	yes, sure.
 VojtechFranc	So, I wish you succesful examination period.
 alesis-novik	Thanks. 4 exams to go.
 VojtechFranc	then good luck!
 VojtechFranc	bye
@bettyboo	VojtechFranc, back to real-life?
 alesis-novik	See you
 VojtechFranc	bettyboo, sorry don't know who is hiding behind this nice nickname
@bettyboo	VojtechFranc: most however try to improve kpca in terms of robustness and not run-time performance
 VojtechFranc	bettyboo, I concentrate on the EM becasue KPCA doesn't seem to be very practical algorithm
@bettyboo	VojtechFranc: Going to discuss details of EM with Vojtech tomorrow
 alesis-novik	A bot that is now saying scary relevant things
 VojtechFranc	battyboo, sorry have to disconnect now. See you

@sonney2k	So Blackburn you are now the one to take over my job
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh..
 blackburn	sonney2k: your baby is born?
@sonney2k	Yes exactly
 blackburn	sonney2k: congrats!
@sonney2k	Sleeping next to me currently.
@sonney2k	Thanks.
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it a boy or girl?
@sonney2k	Boy
 blackburn	nice, did you chose a name?
@sonney2k	Yes Jan
 blackburn	nice! congrats to you again and pass congrats to your wife from cold russia :)
@bettyboo	:Q blackburn
@sonney2k	I am still full of adrenaline so cannot sleep.
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll try to take some your work
@sonney2k	Thanks ... I hope we can leave the hospital this week then I also have my computer plus kbd back
@sonney2k	Anyways good night
 blackburn	sonney2k: no problem, I will just react on some things there will be
 blackburn	sonney2k: good night! let you have some sleep
