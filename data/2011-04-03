@knrrrd	;)
@bettyboo	hihi
@sonney2k	bettyboo, are you always smiling?
@bettyboo	sonney2k: but you are interested in shogun?
@sonney2k	bettyboo, yes of course - now I understand the reason why you are smiling.
@bettyboo	sonney2k: input set of strings, output n-dimensional representation
@sonney2k	bettyboo, You are talkng about kPCA or KFA right?
@bettyboo	sonney2k: shogun: Implement snappy compression support (http://code.google.com/p/snappy/).
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k some of the preprocessing methods for example norm won't it be better to use GSL's code
 Tanmoy	especially BLAS

@sonney2k	Tanmoy, I am not sure I understand: Did you mean we should use blas whenever possible?
@sonney2k	because - that is what we are trying
@sonney2k	(though the preproc code is probably among the oldest parts of shogun and not yet utilizing all of that)
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k yes thts wat i mean
 Tanmoy	for example why would this be required http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/classshogun_1_1CNormOne.html
 Tanmoy	http://www.gnu.org/softhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Level-1-GSL-BLAS-Interface.html
 Tanmoy	when already implemented as a norm in BLAS
 Tanmoy	@sonney2k however for the missing algorithms part i think the desgn issues needs to be a bit better sorted out
@sonney2k	Tanmoy, well one is a preprocessor that you can attach to features and one is just the method to compute the norm of a vector
 Tanmoy	but i belive the work is to find norm right ?
@sonney2k	no, it is that when you have a set of vectors to ensure that they all have norm one.
@sonney2k	so divide each vector by its norm
@sonney2k	it is actually using blas already...
 Tanmoy	yup
 Tanmoy	the link i sent was for norm
 Tanmoy	maybe i shld have said divide by norm :)
@bettyboo	rahaha

 mank	@sonney2k, Hi. I had sent you an email regarding GSoC Project ( i/o in .hdf5 format )
@sonney2k	mank, I recall answering :)
 mank	yeah, I wanted to discuss more about it.
@knrrrd	woah, truecrypt really improved in terms of GUI and usability
@knrrrd	generating a encrypted harddisk is really easy now
@knrrrd	and its cross-platform (in contrast to linux and osx specific drivers)
 mank	@sonney2k, Is it a good time to discuss ?
@sonney2k	mank, if it does not take too long - ask!
 mank	Ok, couple of quick questions.
 mank	1. Are we going to use HDF5 Api's for i/o ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have implemented a fast nearest neighbor classification (in case of k=1) in CKNN class. what should I do after cleaning and commenting to get it commited?
 mank	2. where should i start from ?
-!- siddharth__ [~siddharth@117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	mank, hdf5 api's are already used for i/o look at CHDF5File and the CSerializableHDF5File classes
@sonney2k	mank, look at the CFile API
@sonney2k	blackburn, submit a patch to the mailing list (attach what git format-patch produces )
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay, thank you
 mank	@sonney2k: Thank you. I am really interested in working on this. I will have a look at this and maybe discuss more after going through these resources.
@sonney2k	mank, it would really make sense to do the octave / and older matlab binary formats too... for that look also at the source of octave (it's linked to at the gsoc page)
 mank	ok. I will have a look at that too.
 mank	@sonney2k, Thanks for your time!

 siddharth__	sonney2k, hi
@bettyboo	siddharth__, hey
 siddharth__	hey
@bettyboo	ho
 siddharth__	Dimensionality reduction methods like LLE,ISOMAP not implemented in Shogun right?
 blackburn	I will send a proposal about it
 siddharth__	you working on this?
 blackburn	not working, want to
 siddharth__	so can two people do and divide the work?
 blackburn	I don't know, even don't know any chances to get into this program :)
@bettyboo	funny ;>
 siddharth__	:P
@bettyboo	lol ;D
 blackburn	btw, there is a kernel pca not implemented
 siddharth__	actually there are many Dimensionality Reduction methods yet to be implemented
 blackburn	or implemented.. I forgot
 blackburn	I'll try to send a proposal about LLE, SNE, ISOMAP and MDS
 siddharth__	well lets see...I am also interested in this
 siddharth__	what about boosting algorithms?
 blackburn	what is the question? :)
@bettyboo	:>
 siddharth__	I mean they are also not implemented right?
 blackburn	I don't pretty sure, but there is an classifier/boosting
 siddharth__	yeah that i went through
 siddharth__	most of them implemented
 blackburn	I thought you already chose idea to work with
 siddharth__	yeah I am interested in implementing primal SVM solver...though if this finishes quickly,I want to do work on Dim Red
 blackburn	ah, I see
@knrrrd	there is also the kfa task.
@knrrrd	if you are interested.
 siddharth__	ok I will look into that
@knrrrd	lle, sne and isomap would also be interesting, as they all require a knn backend
-!- serialhex is now known as gsoc_serialhex
@knrrrd	where mds can be build ontop of pca easily
 blackburn	isomap is very similar to mds too
@knrrrd	blackburn: yes? how that?
@knrrrd	ah. yes, isomap employs mds is the last step
@knrrrd	i recall
 blackburn	knrrrd: it is like mds, but with graph distance
 blackburn	yeap
