 cheng	Hi guys, anybody awake yet? As usual, I have a noob question about compilation on OSX.
 cheng	2 issues: First, for some reason the variational_approx_example.cpp doesn't compile. It dies asking for a _main symbol. After removing it from CMakeLists.txt, compilation completes.
 cheng	Second: with the python modular interface, import modshogun gives a segmentation fault.
 cheng	I'm guessing it is some sort of path problem, but I've looked at a few standard things, but nothing seems to help.
 cheng	I'm compiling the develop branch from github
@wiking	mmm hey
@wiking	cheng: what is your swig versio?
 cheng	Swig version 3.0.2
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	:<
@wiking	i have a bad nes for you
@wiking	*news
 cheng	I need some special swig version?
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2313
@wiking	yeah unfortunately until we dont find out what's happening
@wiking	you would need swig2
@wiking	if you want modular interface
 cheng	I see. I'll try to downgrade.
@wiking	sorry for the inconvenience...
 cheng	Price for being bleeding edge. :-)
@wiking	hehehe
 cheng	Downgraded to swig 2.0.12. Still segfaulting. What's the right environment variable to set for lib on OSX?
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	you need to set PYTHONPATH
@wiking	and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
 cheng	Hmm.. I have those environment variables right.
 cheng	make install puts my python code into site-packages and not dist-packages, but I assume that with PYTHONPATH pointing to site-packages, then it should be ok.
@wiking	yes
@wiking	cheng: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9387928/whats-the-difference-between-dist-packages-and-site-packages
@wiking	i.e. dist-packages = debian stuff
@wiking	everywhere else it's site-packages
 cheng	by using python -v, it seems that I'm calling dlopen("./_modshogun.so", 2);
@wiking	where's your PYTHONPATH pointing exactly?
 cheng	PYTHONPATH=/Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/Users/cong/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:
@wiking	how do you import shogun?
 cheng	fresh python terminal.
@wiking	cheng: can you plz paste the output of this: ls /Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 cheng	_modshogun.so is in /Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages
@wiking	btw how's winter over there? :)
 cheng	$ ls /Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ Cartopy-0.11.x-py2.7.egg-infomodshogun.py OptWok-0.4-py2.7.egg-infomodshogun.pyc _modshogun.sooptwok cartopyshogun
@wiking	mmmhm
 cheng	Winter is pretty good in Australia. Temperature is 16C at the moment here in Canberra.
@wiking	is there anything in /Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages/shogun ?
@wiking	cheng: what the heck r u doing in canberra again? :)
 cheng	$ ls /Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages/shogun/ ClassifierDistributionKernelMathematicsStatistics ClusteringEvaluationLatentModelSelectionStructure ConverterFeaturesLibraryPreprocessor__init__.py DistanceIOLossRegression
@wiking	okok that's the old shogun stuff...
 cheng	They closed the lab down in Melbourne. Tough story...
@wiking	damn
@wiking	so you r in nicta on london circuit?
 cheng	Basically, bioinformatics was not that popular in NICTA.
@wiking	:<<<
 cheng	So, now I'm back in the machine learning group.
 cheng	The same one.
@wiking	that was always pretty good @ nicta in canberra
@wiking	i've just relocated to singapore... if you happend to b around drop me a msg
 cheng	Oh where to?
@wiking	ah i'm just nowhere now
@wiking	i've come here coz of my wife
 cheng	I lived there for two years ages ago.
@wiking	so i'm now just hanging around... till i find something
 cheng	What type of job are you looking for?
@wiking	mmm anything :)
 cheng	I know a few people there.
 cheng	Academic?
@wiking	happy to do anything if it's interesting
@wiking	you know ML (possibly shogun) :P
@wiking	usual stuff :>
 cheng	Send me your resume: cheng-soon.ong@nicta.com.au
@wiking	ehehh cool will do
@wiking	thnx heaps!
@wiking	let's see your problem though
 cheng	These path craziness is killing me. /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages does not contain shogun.
@wiking	ok
@wiking	PYTHONPATH=/Users/wiking/shogun-latest-build/lib/python2.7/site-packages DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/wiking/shogun-latest-build/lib ipython
@wiking	import modshogun
@wiking	that does it for me
@wiking	so i would say
@wiking	in your case
@wiking	PYTHONPATH=<the same one you've just pasted> DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/cong/lib python
@wiking	i assume the libshogun.16.1.dylib is in /Users/cong/lib
@wiking	irght?
 cheng	yes.
@wiking	ok  then try that
 cheng	Huh, that works!
@wiking	great
 cheng	What in the world is wrong with my path?
@wiking	nothing
 cheng	Maybe dist-packages?
@wiking	it's just that you haven't installed shogun
@wiking	to a default path
@wiking	that's why you have to do these tricks
@wiking	you can set -DDCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
 cheng	All those exports in .profile doesn't do it??
@wiking	i mean cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
@wiking	..
@wiking	and that will then isntall shogun under /usr/local/lib...
 cheng	I did set INSTALL_PREFIX to /Users/cong/lib
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	then you have to set the right env variables
@wiking	;)
@wiking	.profiles?
@wiking	ah yeah
 cheng	I set environment variables in .profile
@wiking	you can set then there
 cheng	cong:~ cong$ env | grep DYLD DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/cong/lib: cong:~ cong$ env | grep PYTHONPATH PYTHONPATH=/Users/cong/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages: cong:~ cong$ python Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 27 2014, 09:59:51)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang-503.0.38)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import modshogun Segmentation fault: 11 
 cheng	Oops, sorry for the lack of newlines.
 cheng	maybe my python is not reading the environment variables?
 cheng	which python
 cheng	gives /usr/local/bin/python
 cheng	Red herring! Sorry, In the window with the paths set before calling python, I accidentally imported shogun, *not* modshogun.
 cheng	That still segfaults.
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	damn
@wiking	whats your osx version?
 cheng	10.9.4
@wiking	same here :S
 cheng	cmake version 3.0.0
@wiking	gotta run out for 30 mins
@wiking	if u r still around
@wiking	we can debug it
 cheng	Thanks for your patience @wiking!

@wiking	thoralf: hey morning
@thoralf	Hey.
@wiking	thoralf: yeh i was wondering about your idea about protobuf
@thoralf	wiking: Well, HeikoS said he wants to get rid of out home-grown serialization stuff and wants to use boost for it.  I suggested to use protobuf, because we already have this dependency.
@thoralf	I discussed boost vs. protobuf once and I've been told that protobuf is more lightweight and less overengineered.
@thoralf	But I don't have *strong* emotions on this.
@thoralf	My main point was not to talk about boost as long as we don't know why to not use protobuf.
@thoralf	I also like the boost API.
@thoralf	In any case... we have to check how to integrate this to shogun without writing each mapping by hand.
@thoralf	wiking: What do you think about this?
@wiking	just a sec i had a call
@wiking	couldn't read till now
@wiking	yeah but the thing is that it was till now a really good thing that having our own serialization engine
@wiking	we could produce different outputs
@wiking	i.e. json, xml, protobuf
@wiking	etc
@wiking	and there are far better serialization libraries out there than protobuf
@wiking	check this for example: http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/
@wiking	or avro for that matter
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'deb1 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 5m11s]

@thoralf	wiking: I like avro a lot.
@thoralf	wiking: Still we have to see how to integrate all this stuff.
@thoralf	wiking: Anyway, I shouldn't put my opinion on this because I never used this serialization.  The whole discussion started with things to throw out with serialization as one example.
@thoralf	wiking: Then HeikoS said he wants to use boost serialization.
@thoralf	wiking: Then I said why not protobuf, because we already depend on this one.
@thoralf	Now we're here. ;)
@thoralf	Am, btw., the first point on our list was to put promote the nightly images so that we can offer "easy" installation of shogun for various distributions.

@HeikoS	besser82:  not your fault
@besser82	HeikoS, *phew* then i'm a a bit released, now! ^^
@besser82	HeikoS, do we want to share them by bittorrent, too?
@besser82	HeikoS, I have enconded all vids with ogg/theora in CATV airing quali;  yt somehow reprocesses them with a lousier quali...
@HeikoS	besser82: could you share the raw data?
@besser82	HeikoS, you mean the disk_img from the sdcards?
@besser82	HeikoS, files on it isn't touched and are encoded as MPEG-2-streams...
@besser82	HeikoS, vids on yt are mainly untouched; just cut a bit at the beginning and the end...

 PirosB3	Hi all, I have a list of 10 parameters of a function. Each parameter is a boolean value. As the function needs to be very performant, I need to find an intelligent way of caching. Each set of paramenters has a unique output that can be cached. Said this, it probabily is better to cached the most used common parameters first, and the less common used latest (I'm thinking of a sort of decision tree). Is there any algorithm you can suggest to handle this
 PirosB3	problem? thanks!
@lisitsyn	PirosB3: hey, it looks like something similar to tree in huffman coding
@lisitsyn	so its like decision tree yes
 PirosB3	but how can I encode it?
 PirosB3	how can I find the best split
 PirosB3	I have a list of all occurrancies for each parameter
@lisitsyn	ok let me think
@lisitsyn	so you have like 1010101010
 PirosB3	ex: ('(False, False, False, True, False, True, True, True, True, False)', called 9398 times),
@lisitsyn	ahh ok
 PirosB3	('(False, True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, True)', 6020),
 PirosB3	called 6020 times
@lisitsyn	yeah got it so you need to optimize for this frequent cases
 PirosB3	exactly
 PirosB3	it's a cool problem, and probably an overkill for what I'm doing
@lisitsyn	then you need some kind of prefix tree but still not clear how to split it
 PirosB3	what about if I write a cost fn
 PirosB3	where cost == number of times called
 PirosB3	but then, once I write that, I still don't know how to split :D
@lisitsyn	PirosB3: what's pretty clear is that you'd need some kind of tree each node of which checks multiple bits at the moment
@lisitsyn	I mean basic tree won't make it faster for you
 PirosB3	what I could do
 PirosB3	is actually encode the "cost" in between transitions
 PirosB3	from one state to another state
 PirosB3	each decision makes a split
 PirosB3	then just use some optimizer
