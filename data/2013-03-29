@sonney2k	it is 24:00 :)
@sonney2k	thought my phone crashed when it displayed 00:00
@sonney2k	blackburn, how shall we do it about the proposal?
 blackburn	sonney2k: do whatever you want to do with it
@sonney2k	shall I directly edit the proposal gdoc document?
@sonney2k	and you fill in the stuff tomorrow?
 blackburn	sonney2k: if you want to do it not solely - yes
@sonney2k	not sure what you mean
@sonney2k	It would be best to have another iteration
 blackburn	sonney2k: if you want help from fernando or heiko side
 blackburn	you'd have to put it in gdocs
 blackburn	as they can't see the real application
 blackburn	sonney2k: sent a mail
@sonney2k	blackburn, I did too :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what for?
 blackburn	okay whatever I am off for today
 n4nd0	blackburn: ook, good night! and good job :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: good night

 zhuoran	Hi, is anyone online?
 n4nd0	zhuoran: Yep
 zhuoran	I am a newbie here, trying to do a program solving a graph problem
 n4nd0	zhuoran: It sounds fun
 zhuoran	Is there any general common graph class or structure in shogun?
 n4nd0	zhuoran: not explicitly
 n4nd0	but you could use SGMatrix for dense representation or also something for sparse
 n4nd0	SGSparseMatrix
 zhuoran	Or I should write my own adjacency list in program
 zhuoran	SGSparseMatrix
 n4nd0	zhuoran: as you wish :)
 zhuoran	That seems what I want.
 zhuoran	Let me have a glance.
 zhuoran	Thanks!!!
 n4nd0	zhuoran: You are welcome
 n4nd0	zhuoran: What are you working on btw?
 zhuoran	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/873
 zhuoran	Issue 873
 zhuoran	I have already wrote my own program to solve this problem.
 n4nd0	aham cool!
 zhuoran	However, I really not familiar with SHOGUN. I am trying to merge it in.
 n4nd0	zhuoran: Ok, just ask away stuck
 n4nd0	if* stuck
 zhuoran	Thanks :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, fighting w/ the application
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you think it needs that much improvement??
@sonney2k	some parts yes
 n4nd0	I thought it was ok..
 n4nd0	mm I see
 n4nd0	I am going to open the gdocs
 n4nd0	sonney2k: are you modifying it there?
@sonney2k	for example first part was asking about the organizaton
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	but we told only about shogun
@sonney2k	not so much about us
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	I see a much longer description now there
@sonney2k	but it is not much more work
@sonney2k	yes mostly from previous year with adjustments
@sonney2k	what you are marking is what I am working on currenlty
 n4nd0	hehe ok :)
 n4nd0	I tend to highlight things as I read them
@sonney2k	what also will need improvemnt is 6)
@sonney2k	we have to explicitly say why we choose which mentor
@sonney2k	doing that will leave no room for confusion
 n4nd0	I understand
@sonney2k	e.g. vojtech -> libqp expert, shogun mentor me shogun expert etc
 n4nd0	let me write a list with the mentors in there
@sonney2k	yes please I will continue with 2
@sonney2k	the rest likely needs not much polishing
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I just realized - Christian is not mentoring this year? Nor Alex Binder?
@sonney2k	no one asked them I guess?
 n4nd0	too bad
@sonney2k	well we can still add to the ideas list next week

@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah well
@sonney2k	jsut put their names there and I will write more details
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	there are some TODOs together with their names
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, somehow the questions in the gdoc don't match the one in melange
 n4nd0	ouch
@sonney2k	anyway please read 1 & 2
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	shit idk how to make proper comments
 n4nd0	got it now
 n4nd0	you established the JMLR software track? wow
@sonney2k	yeah, mloss.org, mldata.org too
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please read 3-6 now too
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I wrote a couple of minor comments
 n4nd0	if you agree I can modify
@sonney2k	arg I am tired
@sonney2k	so what is missing
 n4nd0	write sth about this 4 guys
@sonney2k	7-11
@sonney2k	let me start from the end
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	please read 11
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	please read 10
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ^
 n4nd0	parsing...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: should we put in 10) that students are also encourage to "idle" at IRC and the communication between students and some mentors is daily there?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes please!
@sonney2k	[;ease do
@sonney2k	pl
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do you know what blackburn meant in 8 with  Second, we do coordinate plans and schedule before GSoC as much as possible and chances are low for busy students.?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: since it is required to write an schedule for the application, students who will be busy during the summer with other occupations are detected??
 n4nd0	I didn't express myself well either TBH...
@sonney2k	so this is about overloaded students!
 n4nd0	I think so
@sonney2k	you can read 9 and 8
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I hope 8 is better now
 n4nd0	yes, I think it is good
 n4nd0	7 and we are done then
@sonney2k	I am dying
@sonney2k	please read the first paragraph of 7
 n4nd0	hehe tomorrow is holiday :)
 n4nd0	yeah I am reading on the way
 n4nd0	hehe hardcore machine learners? :)
@sonney2k	kids wake up in a few hours they won't understand why I waste time on randomly hitting keystrokes at night
 n4nd0	in a few hours?! what time do they normally wake up?
 n4nd0	my gf will wake me up latest at 9h saying, I am hungry, frukost! :D
 n4nd0	Fr?hst?ck
@sonney2k	well I have 4 hours max before being woken up
 n4nd0	wow they really wake up early then
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok done
@sonney2k	please check
@sonney2k	7
 n4nd0	we are good then I think
 n4nd0	sonney2k: are you going to put it in melange right away?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, let me try
@sonney2k	alright submitted
 n4nd0	yaay!

@sonney2k	blackburn, yes indeed :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, please check whether you are OK with the proposal now
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah why not
 blackburn	I am ok with everything
 blackburn	I see you filled in a lot of stuff there
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am thinking about removing dimension reduction thing as it is a separate developed module - would be a bad thing
 blackburn	moving code back and forth is an idiot thing
@sonney2k	remove from where?
 blackburn	sonney2k: from the ideas list
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, I thought you do that in tapkee only anyways and only write wrappers to make it work in shogun?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes and it sounds like a bad idea for *shogun*
@sonney2k	why?
 blackburn	because student would work on tapkee directly and can tend to avoid learning shogun
@sonney2k	we did the same with some other libs and have libqp similarly in the proposal
@sonney2k	blackburn, well you mentor him right?
 blackburn	yes that's why vojtech student didn't know about shogun at all
@sonney2k	so you can make sure he gets it right
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but he did integrate the stuff
 blackburn	ok whatever lets keep it then
@sonney2k	there can be synergies
 blackburn	yeah if I didn't develop a standalone library I wouldn't manage to learn a lot things
@sonney2k	i.e. the external lib profits, shogun profits from the external lib (less code directly maintained in shogun, interfaceses to all $LANG)
 blackburn	yes that was my point too but you didn't like that before?
@sonney2k	blackburn, so what is missing now is to get shogun's build back to green
 blackburn	I have no idea what is missing
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course not in your case
@sonney2k	it is like 1 shogun developer less
@sonney2k	the stuff with vojtech scales as in he continues to develop libqp
@sonney2k	same with libvw
 blackburn	I see nothing different
 blackburn	if you'd rather keep my skills low - yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh you did remove VW ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I didn't yet write an description
@sonney2k	I thought you wanted to have it in the ideas list?
-!- lambday [3ba2174d@gateway/web/freenode/ip.59.162.23.77] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	I have no plan about it yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, the difference is that john langford / vojtech will never work on shogun but their library
 blackburn	may be I'll will write it this weekend
 blackburn	sonney2k: and?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you are very active w/ shogun. when develop a separate library your shogun activity decreases
@sonney2k	that is the difference
 blackburn	but we are not striving for producing a noise but quality right?
@sonney2k	sure why?
 blackburn	what do you mean by decreasing activity then?
@sonney2k	blackburn, one core shogun developer less
@sonney2k	in contrast to an indirect win of one shogun developer when libvw and libqp are improved
@sonney2k	n4nd0, good morning! I will go to bed now to get some more sleep. If you have time please fix the dead link on the front page (middle more button).
 n4nd0	sonney2k: good afternoon :P
 n4nd0	let me see what link is wrong

 n4nd0	thanks!
 n4nd0	I don't really know how it works for shogun-web when one merges things
 n4nd0	if they go directly to the webpage or one should do something else

-!- heiko [~heiko@nat-180-131.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 lambday	hi heiko
 lambday	just saw your comments..
 lambday	fixing the unittest..
 heiko	lambday: these are just minor comments
 heiko	good work otherwise
 lambday	heiko: thanks :)
 lambday	and you mean fixed matrix of 100x100?
 heiko	lambday: yes
 heiko	and do not use log(det(M))
 heiko	but use matlab or something to compute the number to compare to
 lambday	heiko: okay..
 heiko	use the log(det(M)) for the small one
 heiko	should be safe
 lambday	okay..
 lambday	hmmm..
 heiko	in facts, its better to use the number
 heiko	to leave it :)
 heiko	no need for randomness
 heiko	fixed tests are better
 lambday	okay.. will be updating asap..
 heiko	if you want more than one test, what you could do is to introduce some "difficult" matrices with a large condition number, but I think thats not really needed
 lambday	one more thing.. I was working on the sparse case...
 heiko	lambday: yes I saw the mail, let me read it :)
 lambday	heiko: okay.. so I have to manually enter 100,000 numbers, in the test? will be using matlab rand for generating one though.. :(
 lambday	alright :)
 heiko	lambday:
 heiko	no
 heiko	create some matrix with structure and then use that one
 heiko	let me think of an example ...
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 heiko	lambday: just do A=1:100
 heiko	(as col vector)
 heiko	and then A=A*A'
 heiko	and then add some number to the diagonal
 lambday	oh
 lambday	got it
 heiko	to make prevent problems
 lambday	hmmm...
 heiko	you have to add something otherwise smalles Eigenvalue will be zero
 heiko	sum(log(diag(chol(A*A'+eye(size(A,1)))))) =  6.365919548592109
 heiko	on my machine
 heiko	with 1:100
 lambday	testing...
 lambday	yes, same result
 heiko	nice
 lambday	okay.. using that in the test then
 heiko	maybe for the small test, use the log(det(M)) thing and the number
 heiko	lambday: btw you can assert high accuracy floating point results with EXPECT_EQ(CMath::abs(number - expected), 1E-15)
 heiko	ehm
 heiko	EXPECT_LE (less or equal)
 heiko	thats how I usually do it
 lambday	heiko: okay..
 lambday	with floating points this really sounds the best way to check I guess.. I had to fight with it for quite a long time that day..
 heiko	yes the google test one only checks a few digits, which is not enough for us
 lambday	yes..
 blackburn	heiko: ???
 blackburn	heiko: EXPECT_NEAR
 lambday	i tried with expect double eq but that failed
 heiko	blackburn: same thing
 heiko	but yes, actually less to write :)
 heiko	lambday: so check EXPECT_NEAR
 heiko	EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error);  the difference between val1 and val2 doesn't exceed the given absolute error
 lambday	heiko: alright...
 blackburn	heiko: but if there is a bug in cmath::abs?
 heiko	sometimes one has to play with the error tolerances a bit ...
 heiko	blackburn: well we should have a test :)
 blackburn	heiko: and if you don't cover a bug?
 heiko	blackburn: I think its possible to cover all cases for CMath::abs
 heiko	in fact, for this one, I can even prove that it works correctly with some hoare calculus or whatever ;)
 blackburn	heiko: you can't prove that
 heiko	blackburn: I can
 heiko	I learned that at university
 blackburn	heiko: I don't think you can prove that code will work on any compiler/machine
 blackburn	that's why people stick with other tools rather than writing their own
 heiko	blackburn, well wrt to some conditions
 heiko	blackburn: but the same holds for gtest right?
 blackburn	heiko: of course but it is a duty of gtest to write that
 blackburn	heiko: it is sonney2k-like approach to rewrite all the shit and pray
 blackburn	I don't like that
 blackburn	I don't believe my code more than any other code
 heiko	blackburn: so it is the duty of any compiler to check if then else right?
 heiko	from our perspective, it doesnt matter whether we use CMath::abs or gtest since for both to be correct, we have to assume that either compiler or gtest work correct
 heiko	but under the assumption that compiler works correct, the abs code is fine
 blackburn	yes but you have to stick to testing framework when checking invariants
 heiko	blackburn: well what happens if there is a bug in abs?
 heiko	test fails
 blackburn	it is not about that abs thing but in general
 heiko	so with my test I also test abs
 heiko	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	testing through untested
 heiko	agreed
 blackburn	it cascades bugs
 heiko	yes
-!- sumit [73f91219@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.249.18.25] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko: btw the same principle applies to the test coverage thing
 heiko	blackburn: what do you mean?
 blackburn	if we use a lot of CMath etc
 blackburn	it is marked as covered
 blackburn	giving a false feeling of safety
 heiko	test coverage is always a fals feeling of safety right?
 heiko	test coverage can only be used to create feelings of non-safety
 heiko	namely if its low
 blackburn	heiko: yes but the more things you avoid the better that estimate is
 heiko	true
 heiko	blackburn: but this is also a hard problem right?
 blackburn	of course
 heiko	you cannot always check everything from scratch in your tests
 blackburn	heiko: that's why you should not use code you don't test there if possible
 blackburn	and that's why I don't like using any of abs or etc there
 heiko	blackburn: well I agree, but I would say for abs it is not important due to the simplicity of it
 heiko	blackburn: but will avoid in the future
 blackburn	feel free heiko I just warned
 blackburn	heiko: about the proposal - have you checked?
 blackburn	it now contains a lot of stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k rewrote the whole thing or so
 heiko	blackburn: no thats why I am here in fact
 heiko	is it still in the google thingi?
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 heiko	blackburn: btw I read your paper draft.
 heiko	I dont have anything to complain except for a few typos /grammar things
 heiko	will send you a scan of my notes soon
 blackburn	heiko: cool! thanks for reading it
 blackburn	heiko: I owe you a beer :)
 heiko	also like it!
 heiko	beer or bear? :)
 blackburn	heiko: bear hmm I am not sure they live there
 heiko	haha :)
 blackburn	heiko: if you go with me a little eastern
 blackburn	I could find you some bear
 heiko	hehe :)
 heiko	so when is deadline?
 blackburn	deadline for?
 blackburn	heiko: gsoc?
 heiko	jlmr
 heiko	jmlr
 blackburn	heiko: I don't know - is there any deadline? :)
 blackburn	I mean it is not even submitted yet
 heiko	blackburn: ok I see, so no stress in sending you the feedback
 blackburn	yeah a month is ok
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	my parents are here thats why I ask , so I do this afterwards :D
 lambday	heiko: I made the changes, it seems that 1E-15 is not working... I've kept it 1E-10
 heiko	lambday, thats fine - go as accurate as you can
 blackburn	heiko: yeah you should rather get to your parents :)
 blackburn	lambday: 1e-15 is too tight
 lambday	hmmm...
 heiko	blackburn: I sent them to the british museum which is 5 mins from here :)
 heiko	blackburn: I sometimes use 1E-15
 heiko	but 10 should also be fine
 lambday	I'm committing then
 heiko	lambday: nice
 blackburn	heiko: it should be ok for small numbers
 heiko	I have to leave soon, so if you hurry, I will merge before :)
 blackburn	heiko: but 1 != 1 with 1e-15 I think?
 blackburn	may be 1==1 but could be that 3!=3 :)
 heiko	blackburn, lambday, just go maximum that gets accepted :)
 heiko	just more than 6 that was my point
 lambday	heiko: okay.. :)
 lambday	and I need a good tutorial for git I guess :( 80% of the time I am wondering about git..
 lambday	I git a git add Statistics_unittest.cc and then git commit...
 heiko	lambday: haha, I totally know that and have that too from time to time :)
 heiko	best is ask blackburn
 heiko	lambday: thats fine --- add/commit for new files
 lambday	heiko: :( :( ...
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zRIbf6JqkNc
 heiko	blackburn: the application is very good I think
 heiko	blackburn: so not changing anything - you should commit :)
 heiko	I have to leave in 2 mins
 blackburn	heiko: boss made the deal already I thnik
 lambday	blackburn: :D
 heiko	blackburn: I see, nice then, should be no problems
 lambday	how to do the git pull --rebase thing? git pull --rebase upstream master... here shall I put upstream as "https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun" or my forked repo?
 heiko	lambday, from your master branch you do
 heiko	git fetch upstream
 heiko	git pull --rebase upstream master
 heiko	the you change to your feature branch and do
 blackburn	fetch is redundant here
 heiko	git rebase master
 heiko	then you go to master  again and do
 lambday	heiko: alright..
 heiko	git merge feature_branch_name
 heiko	then you do git push
 lambday	okay..
 heiko	lambday: and if you have changes you have to stash or commit them first
 heiko	and a good tip is:
 heiko	never modify the master branch
 heiko	only for pushing :)
 heiko	otherwise you can create a mess easily
 heiko	had that often
 heiko	but might be my stupidity :)
 heiko	lambday: ok sorry, gotta go now, will check tonight
 heiko	blackburn,lambday  bye!
 lambday	heiko: okay... thanks :) ciao

@sonney2k	lambday, I just realize that your PR did contain all the previous commits - please for next time use git commit --amend or git reset <version> and commit a single clean version
@sonney2k	lambday, this way the buildbot will not fail for the old broken commits (it builds every commit...).
 lambday	sonney2k: yes.. sorry for messing it up this time..
@sonney2k	n4nd0, thanks for fixing the link
@sonney2k	lambday, don't worry we are no better in all that
 lambday	sonney2k: next time onwards I'll be more careful before sending a PR..
@sonney2k	lambday, btw please also set a proper user name for your git stuff
@sonney2k	lambday, don't worry it is our mistake not to tell you upfront
 n4nd0	is it fixed now?
@sonney2k	we do / did the same stuff
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I didn't put it to the website yet
 n4nd0	I tried but it goes still to the old link!
 lambday	sonney2k: I have been struggling with git... hope to get better asap :(
@sonney2k	I was thinking that maybe we should put the workshop instead of the demos to the front page
 n4nd0	all right
@sonney2k	lambday, we still struggle with git too so welcome to the team :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, would you agree?
 n4nd0	writing on the phone here - 5 keystrokes per minute :)
@sonney2k	I mean it does help a lot
@sonney2k	n4nd0, pretty fast you are then :D
 lambday	sonney2k: everyone around here is so helpful.. :) thanks for being so patient
 n4nd0	git yeah... our eternal archienemy/best friend :D

 n4nd0	I agree with the workshop idea, probably lot of people will visit the page soon
 n4nd0	the more visible the better I think
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok then we should do it rather now. If you have time please write up sth. I am trying to find /ask for a nice c-base figure to put on the front page
 n4nd0	I am not at home now unfortunately
 n4nd0	no computer around to work, maybe tonight when I get back
@sonney2k	ahh true
@sonney2k	phone :D
 n4nd0	yeah
* sonney2k is asking for a pic at #c-base
 n4nd0	what kind of pic you have in mind?
 n4nd0	the spaceship one is fancy hehe
@sonney2k	http://gallery.c-base.org/
@sonney2k	the logo on top would be cool
@sonney2k	or the starshop
@sonney2k	looks cool for sure
 n4nd0	so you have to ask them for the permission to use it I understand
@sonney2k	or this one http://vimeo.com/cbase
@sonney2k	I think so
 n4nd0	I like these ones better than the spaceship
 n4nd0	but any is fine I think
 lambday	sonney2k: one stupid question - why did you named this project shogun? I mean, what does "sho gun" mean?
 n4nd0	soeren sonnenburg and gunnar raetsch I think - main original authors
 n4nd0	sort of acronym of their names
@sonney2k	lambday, yes indeed what n4nd0 said
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I will just fix the website as is - please when you have time write some text for the middle block
 lambday	n4nd0: hmmm.. :)
@sonney2k	it seems it takes some time to get permission to use a c-base logo
@sonney2k	lambday, we had other ideas like Reason/ Raeson / but in some survey people did prefer shogun :D
 lambday	sonney2k: shogun sounds cool.. I put that in google translator from japanese to english and it showed "military treatment" :D
 n4nd0	ok will do tonight probably
 n4nd0	tomorrow afternoon I am going to travel and I will be until Tuesday eveningn completely off so I will do it before going
@sonney2k	n4nd0, thanks. I will fix the website now and then we still have this burning issue with tests not being all passing :/
@sonney2k	I could use some help for that...
 n4nd0	any clue what is wrong?
 n4nd0	I can spend some time tonight

@sonney2k	n4nd0, thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have time to help fixing the buildbot errors?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 wiking	sonney2k: what's the bug that holds back switching to dev branch?
@sonney2k	wiking, I've made tests / example failures critical
 blackburn	wiking: something is wrong
@sonney2k	i.e. when one fails -> boom
@sonney2k	buildbot fails
@sonney2k	before that we didn't enable this stuff
 wiking	ah ok
@sonney2k	and because of that we saw lots of breakage recently
 wiking	yeah i know that examples were not critical eariler
@sonney2k	so we didn't detect the issues
 wiking	sonney2k: some of the code always core dumped on the fbsd bot i saw that in dmesg always
@sonney2k	wiking, I am still not sure I really enabled all of them
 blackburn	sonney2k: we've got to ignore these 3 kernels
 blackburn	and hmm
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah some examples generate random data
 blackburn	that's not possible to solve
@sonney2k	and so they fail only sometimes (well did fail - I've set the seed now)
 wiking	ok, where's the list of failures? :)
@sonney2k	wiking, buildbot
 wiking	blackburn: u have your visa for july workshop? :)
@sonney2k	but caution
 wiking	sonney2k: just checking
 blackburn	wiking: no
@sonney2k	we only see python failures for now
 wiking	blackburn: :( get it!
 blackburn	wiking: yeah I should
@sonney2k	the other stuff will only become visible once python failures are fixed
@sonney2k	wiking, and once we fixed that all I still don't know what we do with buildbots
 wiking	blackburn: is the tsn or what the hell in tapkee now?
@sonney2k	I've checked config and we explicitly run the buildbot for master branch only
 blackburn	wiking: yes t-sne is in
 wiking	blackburn: mmm i ought to test that
 wiking	blackburn: in shogun as well? or only tapkee for now?
 blackburn	wiking: no I didn't manage to write a wrapper class yet
 wiking	blackburn: so tapkee only cool i'll hae to check that tonight then
 blackburn	wiking: if your data is dense you may use that simple app that comes with tapkee
@sonney2k	wiking, you know there was more important stuff to do gsoc application!
 wiking	blackburn: yeah it is so then i can test it out of box

 blackburn	wiking: it reads ascii and outputs ascii
 blackburn	wiking: one row = one feature
 wiking	blackburn: cool
 wiking	blackburn: csv?
 blackburn	wiking: no I am lazy
 blackburn	just ascii
 wiking	blackburn: space?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	ok
 wiking	blackburn: i'll test it then soonish and let you know what did it do with my stuff
 blackburn	wiking: ./bin/tapkee -m t-sne -i input.dat -o output.dat
 blackburn	wiking: ./bin/tapkee -m t-sne -i input.dat -o output.dat --sne-perplexity 50 --sne-theta 0.5
 blackburn	wiking: two params
 wiking	blackburn: where's more info about those two params
 wiking	blackburn: and what's the output btw? clustered vectors?
 blackburn	wiking: I have to admit I don't know the exact meaning
 blackburn	wiking: clustered??
 blackburn	wiking: ./bin/tapkee -m t-sne -i input.dat -o output.dat -td 2 --sne-perplexity 50 --sne-theta 0.5
 blackburn	-td is target dimension
 blackburn	2 by default
 blackburn	http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3342 that's the paper on barnes-hut-sne
 wiking	well okeeey
 wiking	i guess i'll need a bit bigger -td :P
 blackburn	wiking: why?
 wiking	i have a feeling
 wiking	but then again no idea
 wiking	so i'll just test it
 blackburn	wiking: 3?
 blackburn	do you see through multidimensional spaces?
 blackburn	:D
* wiking haz magic eyez
 wiking	blackburn: http://animalsbeingdicks.com/
 wiking	blackburn: just for those hours when u give a fuck
 wiking	;P
 blackburn	wiking: t-SNE is purposed for visualization (d=2,3)
 blackburn	that's why I am surprised
 blackburn	wiking: furthermore barnes hut is *specialized* to support only 2 IIRC
 wiking	mmmmhm
 blackburn	wiking: yeah you can't set it to 3 even :D
 wiking	ahhaha ok
 blackburn	wiking: I can check if I can extend it
 blackburn	wiking: alrightt should work with other valuesto
 blackburn	too*
 blackburn	wiking: PARAMETER(ScalarType, perplexity,        SNE_PERPLEXITY,    IN_RANGE(perplexity,0,(N-1)/3));
 blackburn	wiking: last parameter tells you about possible range of perplexity :)
 blackburn	wiking: and theta=0 means t-SNE while theta>0 means barnes-hut-sne

 blackburn	lets check basic t-sne
 blackburn	without barnes-hut
 blackburn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/959 what do you think?
@sonney2k	blackburn, looks nice? gsoc idea?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think a week of work
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't remember whether you responded to my comment to this: one can do this all in c++
@sonney2k	with some kind of builder pattern and then it should immediately work from all *modular interfaces like that
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is not a pure builder pattern
 blackburn	it is a builder without need to call build()
@sonney2k	but you are right thinking about it it should be very easy. would even say just 1 day of work
 blackburn	sonney2k: not a day - we do not support list of sgobjects
@sonney2k	true woudl need a new typemap
 blackburn	sonney2k: with proper design it could be heavily advertised
@sonney2k	what I don't understand with this syntax though is how one would do nested things
@sonney2k	like in your example try out gaussian_kernel with certain params and then linear kernel with other params etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: how does it work now?
@sonney2k	I don't recall exactly - heiko would know
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually I see it like that
@sonney2k	I had this bracket based solution that supports that
@sonney2k	but it would require typemaps all over
 blackburn	gaussian_kernel.parameter("width").as(ExponentialRange).from(-10).to(10)
 blackburn	my_kernel.parameter("happiness").as(LinearRange).from(0).to(10)
 blackburn	svm.parameter("kernels").as(ValuesSet).values([my_kernel,gaussian_kernel])
 blackburn	that's all
 blackburn	when you are done
 blackburn	svm.deactivate_parameters()
 blackburn	no tree messing at all
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	blackburn, I totally swapped out how that works internally
 blackburn	sonney2k: step by step
@sonney2k	might work I am not sure
 blackburn	gaussian_kernel.parameter("width").as(ExponentialRange).from(-10).to(10)
@sonney2k	I mean this syntax is certainly powerful enough
 blackburn	1) gaussian_kernel.parameter("width") returns an instance of some class parameter (not parameter we have)
@sonney2k	I just don't know if we can easily map it to the structure we have
 blackburn	2) it sets default parameters to that parameter
 blackburn	3) as(ExponentialRange) pushes the parameter to the exponential state
 blackburn	4) from(-10) sets lower bound
 blackburn	5) to(10) sets upper bound
@sonney2k	blackburn, I've committed the submitted proposal to publicity & updated the website
 blackburn	okay a few issues more
 blackburn	1.1) each parameter("width") call marks parameter inside a class as *to-be-modelselected*
 blackburn	3.1) as(ExponentialRange) has some default thing too
 blackburn	sonney2k: the only flaw
 blackburn	if we call wrong order or wrong methods
 blackburn	it is runtime error
 blackburn	not a compile-time error
 blackburn	but that's default tradeoff
 blackburn	I am totally sure people would get excited about that
@sonney2k	blackburn, I just checked modelselection_grid_search_kernel.cpp ?
@sonney2k	and I think your idea would work if one includes a
@sonney2k	CModelSelectionParameters* in SGObject
@sonney2k	only issue is that the complete tree has to be constructed somehow
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not know exactly but I see it constructing each time parameter() method is called
@sonney2k	ModelSelectionParameters can handle nested stuff
@sonney2k	so I guess simplest soluton would be to have non-nested stuff inside each class
 blackburn	sonney2k: there should be major changes in the framework to support that
@sonney2k	I don't think so
@sonney2k	then when the whole object to be model selected is ready
@sonney2k	one creates the tree by going top->down
@sonney2k	creating the nested CModelSelectionParameters
@sonney2k	I think that's all
 blackburn	sonney2k: no it should not be top to down in final
 blackburn	I'd vote for magic
@sonney2k	what magic?
 blackburn	each time parameter() of some sgobject is activated
 blackburn	the tree is reconstructed etc
 blackburn	or may be it is constructed only when doing model selection
 blackburn	that makes sense to me as well
@sonney2k	that is what I meant
@sonney2k	(the latter idea)
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	I have two major ideas now
 blackburn	client server and that
@sonney2k	but no time to do either one
 blackburn	haha
@sonney2k	that is why I am saying -> gsoc idea!
 blackburn	that's a tough idea
 blackburn	basically one has to be a shogun developer to understand what to change
 blackburn	I imagine if I would be asked to do that 2 years ago
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh btw yesterday was the day I joined #shogun
 blackburn	2 years ago
 blackburn	I feel youth is slipping away haha
@sonney2k	habby 2nd b'day
@sonney2k	blackburn, well heiko did the whole model selection framework in his first gsoc
@sonney2k	so what is more tough?
 blackburn	sonney2k: his current idea
@sonney2k	yes indeed *lol*
 blackburn	develop a new machine learning paradigm
 blackburn	abstract
 blackburn	structured risk minimization was developed by vapnik in the end of 20th century. we need a new framework
@sonney2k	structured output on general graphs & large scale is already sufficient
 blackburn	sonney2k: but it is not heiko thing?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no but if you have some idea how to even do that - there is a workshop at this years icml about it :D
 blackburn	I don't know about machine learning
 blackburn	so no
@sonney2k	yeah and you don't drink vodka all day

@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	just mentions changes

@sonney2k	n4nd0, well you could program some simple solution easily - just add a revision to each object

@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes but this is (not yet) a problem
