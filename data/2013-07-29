 pickle27	sonney2k: right, I don't see anything about RealFeatures in here though
@sonney2k	> library(modshogun)
@sonney2k	Welcome! This is SHOGUN version 2.2.0
@sonney2k	> x=GaussianKernel()
@sonney2k	> x
@sonney2k	An object of class "_p_shogun__CGaussianKernel"
@sonney2k	Slot "ref":
@sonney2k	Error in slot(object, what) :
@sonney2k	  no slot of name "ref" for this object of class "_p_shogun__CGaussianKernel"
 pickle27	just SGVector and SGMatrix
@sonney2k	the question is what is this ref slot
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I guess that's lispy name for method
 lisitsyn	they follow some scheme-like thing inside R
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, for what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: for ref()
 lisitsyn	member function
 lisitsyn	whatever
@sonney2k	what method do we need?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I guess it tries to call ref()
@sonney2k	pickle27, ahh sure typemaps are just SGVector/SGMatrix stuff
@sonney2k	pickle27, so whenever you have a function signature
@sonney2k	foo(SGVector<double> x)
@sonney2k	you can write foo(c(1,2,3)) from R
@sonney2k	similar for output
@sonney2k	(in and out typemaps!)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, IDK I tried some minimal R example where I used ref/unref and they *were* called
@sonney2k	no issues
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no I was just guessing so everything can happen
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay - so then where do I need to be looking for figuring out the RealFeatures problem
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, bah slotNames(x)
@sonney2k	[1] "ref"
@sonney2k	wtf?
@sonney2k	pickle27, well lets start with some simple example first
@sonney2k	x=RealLabels(c(1.0,2.2))
@sonney2k	when this is called
@sonney2k	pickle27, go to line 36 in swig_typemaps.i
@sonney2k	you will see a typecheck typemap
@sonney2k	and a in typemap
@sonney2k	for SGVector types
 pickle27	yeah Im there
@sonney2k	the typecheck typemap well test if the type matches
@sonney2k	if it does it returns the equiv of true (1) otherwise 0
@sonney2k	so my first guess is that this always returns 0
@sonney2k	maybe add some SG_SPRINT there to see the result
@sonney2k	pickle27, if the typecheck typemap returns 1
@sonney2k	the in typemap will be reached
@sonney2k	and that one then just has to assign an appropriate SGVector to $1
@sonney2k	currently it doesn't  copy the memory and so the simple example (if it would pass the typecheck typemap) woudl just crash
@sonney2k	since SGVector will at some point deallocate the memory when you exit R
@sonney2k	and R likely too

 pickle27	sonney2k: so bascially print the result of line 49
@sonney2k	pickle27, questions?
 pickle27	i mean 40
 pickle27	(TYPEOF($input) == r_type && Rf_ncols($input)==1 )
@sonney2k	pickle27, I am just trying this with all fields

-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-243-23-104.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has left #shogun []
@sonney2k	pickle27, but then the big issue is to figure out why refcounting doesn't work
@sonney2k	pickle27, I am not even getting towards the typecheck
@sonney2k	so one now would have to debug the generated R code
@sonney2k	pickle27, hmm
@sonney2k	if I do
@sonney2k	x=RegressionLabels()
@sonney2k	> x$set_labels(c(1.0,2.3))
@sonney2k	> x$get_label(0)
@sonney2k	[1] 1
@sonney2k	> x$get_label(1)
@sonney2k	[1] 2.3
@sonney2k	it seems alright
@sonney2k	maybe it `just' doesn't work in the constructor style syntax
 pickle27	hmm
@sonney2k	yeah seems like
@sonney2k	with RealFeatures I get the (expected) crasher when I do
@sonney2k	> x=RealFeatures()
@sonney2k	> x$set_features(matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),2,3))
 pickle27	sonney2k: I get this when I run that
 pickle27	Error: evaluation nested too deeply: infinite recursion / options(expressions=)?
@sonney2k	pickle27, there are certainly more issues but maybe it is a start
* sonney2k Zzzzz.
 pickle27	wierd this time I got a backtrace
 pickle27	ahg I hate when I accidently ctrl-l irc

@sonney2k	foulwall`, hey there - any news on the README?
 foulwall`	Hey sonney2k, already finished, and now working on migration for tapkee demos.
-!- iglesiasg [~Fernando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@sonney2k	foulwall`, please send a PR then
 foulwall`	ok sonney2k
 van51	heh I thought that the ` after foulwall` was dust on my screen :p
@sonney2k	van51, heh!
@sonney2k	van51, so how is it going now?
 van51	sonney2k: well first of all, the CHashedDocDotFeatures and the converter have identical results
@sonney2k	van51, btw regarding benoits email - we already use bitmasks right?
 van51	sonney2k: in the doc features
@sonney2k	van51, excellent!
@sonney2k	van51, and speed?
 van51	sonney2k: in dense/sparse I had switched to just mod
 van51	sonney2k: for speed I'm not sure, it depends on the normalization
 van51	sonney2k: I mean unnormalized dot features take a lot time
@sonney2k	van51, well of course with same normalization
 van51	sonney2k: but the sparsefeatures returned from the converter are not normalized
@sonney2k	van51, oh you should add that to the converter too!
 van51	sonney2k: I tried but it would be the same normalziation. In the dot features we normalize the result, while there we create the entire vector so we would normalize each feature
 van51	wouldn't
 van51	dot product result*
@sonney2k	van51, parse error
 van51	sonney2k: heh
 van51	sonney2k: in the dot features we compute the dense dot for instance
 van51	sonney2k: and we normalize it
@sonney2k	van51, you jsut normalize each feature by dividing with 1/sqrt(count)
@sonney2k	van51, sure but in dotfeatures add_to_dense_vec you do the same normalization per feature
 van51	sonney2k: I tried it with 1/sqrt(doc.size()) and it was giving poor results
 van51	sonney2k: maybe I missed something
 van51	sonney2k: I can try it again though
 van51	sonney2k: btw I wanted to ask you about the CCommUlongKernel with svmLight that you had told me
 van51	sonney2k: I tried to compare their speed first, but when I used the kernel it segfaulted in a radix_sort method
 van51	sonney2k: I'm guessing it ran out of memory
@sonney2k	van51, maybe forgot that you need to use a double?
@sonney2k	van51, it should give the exact same results
@sonney2k	van51, hmmhh radix sort should work just fine (at least it did)
 van51	sonney2k: I'll reproduce it now

 votjakovr	sonney2k: hi! i've found, that since doxygen 1.7.2 we can use MathJax instead of using prerendered bitmaps for rendering formulas. I think, that with MathJax formulas will be prettier. What do you think about using it?
@sonney2k	votjakovr, sure!
@sonney2k	votjakovr, that would speed up things too
@sonney2k	votjakovr, only issue is that it won't detect errors in the file - I mean if any of us screws up a formula

 lisitsyn	largely marginal

 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ja this one
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg, is it better performance wise now?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so so. My implementation currently sucks a bit compared to the author's (and it is in Matlab, although with some parts in C)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, no, not yet
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I realized I have to change a sort of big thing now
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, well, not that big actually

@iglesiasg	let me show you then, on moment

@iglesiasg	one*
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/feature/lmnn/src/shogun/metric/LMNNImpl.cpp#L135
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so I have that method right now that is computing the difference between every pair of feature vectors, and then computing the outer product of the diff vector with itself
@sonney2k	foulwall, and where is the README PR ?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, right now that computes N^2 matrices of D^2 elements each one
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, it is possible to make that smaller
 foulwall	sonney2k: sending
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, since (x_i-x_j)*(x_i-x_j)' is the same as (x_j-x_i)*(x_j-x_i)'
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, but I think that even if I take that into account, it is still something too big to keep in memory (it will still be the order of N^2 matrices)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah quite big thing
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so I think that it is better to compute the outer products on demand; every time one is needed I compute it, even if that migh entail computing the same outer product more than once
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what do you think of doing it on demand?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think the author's implementation does it in this way
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg, would be slower I guess but takes less memory
 lisitsyn	if you dont have any N2 matrices more it totally makes sense
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, then the bottleneck is this method https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/feature/lmnn/src/shogun/metric/LMNNImpl.cpp#L316
 lisitsyn	are there any more N2 matrices?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, sounds like kernel caching
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, yeah, I thought that caching could help
@iglesiasg	so I think that for the moment I will modify the code to compute outer products on demand, and later we can see if it pays off to have caching
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, what do you mean if there are more N2 matrices?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I think caching makes sense here
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: if thats the only NxN matrix here
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aah ok got it. Yes it is
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, but note that it is not only a NxN matrix
 lisitsyn	then kill it yeah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, it is NxN matrices of DxD elements each (N=number of vectors, D=feature dimension)
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	heh
@iglesiasg	because you compute the outer product of the difference of feature vectors
@iglesiasg	for each pair of feature vectors, you make its difference, and compute the outer product of the difference with itself
 lisitsyn	yeah thats not something to be in memory

 lisitsyn	by outer product you mean dger from blas
 lisitsyn	eight?
 lisitsyn	right?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, no idea :D
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, there are two ways you can multiply a vector with itself
 lisitsyn	yeah heard sth
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, inner product -> you get an scalar (something like x'*x)
 lisitsyn	this one produces matrix
@iglesiasg	outer product -> you get a matrix (x*x')
@iglesiasg	exactly
 lisitsyn	dger :p
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I am checking dger
 lisitsyn	ddot and dger
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, yeah it seems to be like that
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, although they same in the doc that it is x*y' where x has m elements and n elements
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg, eigen has symmetric rank update
 lisitsyn	i used that thing in tapkees pca
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, symmetric rank update? Do you think that could help me to make it faster?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, right now I get two eigen vectors, make their difference, and then the outer product
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/feature/lmnn/src/shogun/metric/LMNNImpl.cpp#L154
@iglesiasg	that line and the next one
 lisitsyn	no probably wont help here
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aham. Why do you think so?
@iglesiasg	just trying to understand it better :)
 lisitsyn	iirc that rank update is better for multiple calls
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I guess it is a matter of testing it anyway, so I will keep in mind that there is another way of getting the outer product

@sonney2k	van51, minimalchange: https://gist.github.com/sonney2k/6106780
 pickle27	hahaha I do that too
 pickle27	except I have this thing where I like to clear my terminals using ctrl-l all the time
 van51	sonney2k: hey sorry I was helping my grandmother with something
 pickle27	and then I clear IRC and its annoying
@iglesiasg	hehe
 van51	sonney2k: what did you change?
 van51	the 8-1?
@sonney2k	van51, yeah
@sonney2k	like in the python example
 van51	sonney2k: what is the meaning of start then?
@sonney2k	van51, where to start
 van51	sonney2k: :p
@sonney2k	van51, well this is doing some bitheavy stuff
@sonney2k	and basically it goes back 8 chars from the start so starting at index 7 is what you want to get 7...0
 van51	sonney2k: ah I see
 van51	sonney2k: well I'm going to get some food and work on some stuff later and overnight
 van51	sonney2k: btw I've also started the document example
 van51	sonney2k: and I was thinking of making a simple web ui, just to be able to write some lines and test it
@sonney2k	van51, use the python_modular interface instead and some simple input or so and foulwall can later nicely integrate this
 van51	sonney2k: ok
 van51	sonney2k: so I'm off for about an hour
 van51	cu later
@sonney2k	van51, btw it might be good to do that for your example too. prototyping with python really is much faster (and debugging too!)
 van51	sonney2k: I don't know python so I'm trying to avoid it
 van51	sonney2k: but I guess it's a good time to get to know as well :0

 pickle27	sonney2k: I tried the new R modular and I ran those samples you posted and they work for me
 pickle27	sonney2k: it still seams like none of the methods are "binding" though
 pickle27	whenever I try and use a method I get a not found error
@sonney2k	pickle27, that must be some swig issue - we have ton's of constructors
 pickle27	yeah
@sonney2k	so figuring out which one to use is the task of swig

@sonney2k	pickle27, back then I totally understood how that R stuff worked but I forgot
@sonney2k	pickle27, the only thing I remember is that from the R code there are some tests run selecting the appropriate constructor
 pickle27	sonney2k: and I have no idea how it works
 pickle27	it sounds like its pretty tough to fix - maybe I'll just push an r_static example for now

@sonney2k	foulwall`, please put them again under shogun-data/tapkee
 foulwall`	ok sonney2k , I'll resend
@sonney2k	foulwall`, it might make sense to not have >1000 files too btw
@sonney2k	foulwall`, maybe better use a single .zip file with the images in there
@sonney2k	like faces.zip
@sonney2k	and mnist.zip
 foulwall`	I see
@sonney2k	foulwall`, btw do you have a live demo already for that?

 gsomix	sonney2k, forgot it. =___= today was little holiday, sorry.
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw I haven't any warnings related to format on my machine.
@sonney2k	gsomix, I need to merge yours before I can start to convert examples
@sonney2k	gsomix, yeah sure 32bit vs 64bit
@sonney2k	gsomix, so use the 'standard' ones and we will be fine
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha, indeed.
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, can I help with examples&
 gsomix	*?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, wiking, votjakovr, pickle27 anyone here up to doing a doc sprint at google in october?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sure!
@sonney2k	gsomix, well sure but we are quite a bit behind schedule :/
 pickle27	probably no for me because I'm hoping to be doing some travelling in Oct
@sonney2k	it is during oct14-18 http://www.booksprints.net/2013/07/2013-doc-camp-announced/
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what should we do to raise our odds of getting in?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, IDK
@sonney2k	we certainly need 4 people that can do a stunt
 pickle27	sonney2k: looks very cool though, I'd be happy to help I just won
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, would you be in?
 pickle27	't be able to be there
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, HeikoS, me + ??
@iglesiasg	let's see if wiking and lisitsyn could make it

@sonney2k	copy & pasting parts from people's thesis would not be that easy then
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, lol
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think that is our only chance to *finish* a book in 4 days

@iglesiasg	to me that looks like a nice real book
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what do you think?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, looks *very* cool
@iglesiasg	indeed, we agree :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, can this be converted to some epub /pdf etc?
@sonney2k	or is it 'just' web?

@iglesiasg	let me have a quick look
@sonney2k	van51, hey again
 van51	sonney2k: hi
@iglesiasg	they say so in the page, no idea how it looks like, let's see
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, ok then it is pretty clear how to increase our chances - we should have some ideas what our target audience is, structure, running examples and methods we want to use
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, but issue still remains that we are just a very small org (compared to e.g. KDE)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, when is the deadline?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, in 3 days
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I am thinking, if it is after GSoC ends
@iglesiasg	shit...
@sonney2k	or 5?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, last year it was like this
@iglesiasg	I drop the idea then
@sonney2k	before august 7!
@sonney2k	if heiko is not around for discussion yeah then indeed
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11020840/June82013.pdf
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, pdf version of the book
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, IMHO it looks nicer in the browser, but it is still cool I think
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I think we have a chance this year
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, jsut because big data etc is such a big hype
 gsomix	sonney2k, compiling...
@sonney2k	so we should try!

@sonney2k	gsomix, maybe we should talk how to continue in general?
@sonney2k	gsomix, it would be nice to have the other ascii formats working
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
@sonney2k	gsomix, and the stringfeatures/sparsefeatures/densefeatures/matrixfeatures etc cleaned up / supported
 gsomix	sonney2k, so I'm working on libsvm file format now.
@sonney2k	I mean this is the first and most important thing to finish
@sonney2k	gsomix, sounds like I should rather convert the examples
@sonney2k	while you continue your work
@sonney2k	gsomix, afterwards I would like us to have some binary format based on protobuf and well there still is reading / writing matlab files
@sonney2k	which likely is most important for users

 gsomix	sonney2k, aha
@sonney2k	gsomix, but seriously I think most people will just use ascii and matlab format
 gsomix	sonney2k, other ascii formats. which?
@iglesiasg	matlab format please!
@iglesiasg	gsomix, when are we getting this? Really looking forward to it
 gsomix	sonney2k, matlab7 file format is last version, right?
@sonney2k	gsomix, arff then van51 would say vw
@sonney2k	gsomix, no
@sonney2k	gsomix, matlab has a couple of formats
 gsomix	sonney2k, not compatible?
@sonney2k	gsomix, as I wrote on the ideas page octave supports reading IIRC up to 7.2
@sonney2k	afterwards they switched to sth hdf5 based
@sonney2k	so you it would take some time
@sonney2k	to do this
 gsomix	sonney2k, I should look into octave source? or there is specs on 7.2?
 gsomix	I found only 7.0.1
@sonney2k	gsomix, http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/matlab/matfile_format.pdf
 gsomix	sonney2k, huh! I never imagined that I could find it on mathworks site.
 gsomix	I mean MATLAB very closed and have not many docs about how it works inside.
 gsomix	*is very
@sonney2k	gsomix, it seems not to be the latest format for sure

@sonney2k	gsomix, maybe you can use octave's reader somehow
@sonney2k	gsomix, only issue is we cannot test this
@sonney2k	we have no matlab
@sonney2k	so maybe we just get some .mat file from sb.
@sonney2k	and also the ascii representation or sth
@sonney2k	and then you can read/compare
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, I can test it on my local machine.
 gsomix	and I can make .mat with ascii representation too
 gsomix	I have licensed matlab 2013a at lab.
 gsomix	sonney2k, I'm not full clear with protobuf now.
 gsomix	sonney2k, we plan to develop our file format based on protobuf? or so?
