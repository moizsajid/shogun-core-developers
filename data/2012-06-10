 n4nd0	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	need matlab to test slep :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham
 n4nd0	do you need a copy of matlab?
 blackburn	no I have one
 n4nd0	all right then :)
 blackburn	and I dooo nooot have crack for that
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	ooh I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: still there?
 blackburn	I am searching for a conference where I can present shogun :D
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	in Russia, or you don't mind where?
 blackburn	better far away :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: just let me know if you want some help with it
 n4nd0	I would love to participate in any way
 blackburn	sure

@sonney2k	gsomix, yes - whats up?
 gsomix	sonney2k, machines
 gsomix	can you look at director machines?

@sonney2k	gsomix, looks fine - now we only need some example
 gsomix	sonney2k, have any ideas?
 blackburn	I see one problem here
 blackburn	train_machine is a) protected b) have default parameter
@sonney2k	gsomix, you could do parzen windows with gaussian kernel (equation 55 in   https://www.cs.utah.edu/~suyash/Dissertation_html/node11.html )
@sonney2k	for the directorkernelmachine
 blackburn	haha parzen finally
 blackburn	or with Epanechnikov kernel!
@sonney2k	sounds like a disease
 blackburn	sonney2k: no typical kernel in atypical kernel mean :)
 blackburn	statistic kernel I mean
 blackburn	is there anyone to describe me what is advantage having sparse inverse covariance estimator?
@sonney2k	gsomix, and for linearmachine - you could implement a linear perceptron algorithm is here (page 2 on top https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/ML09/lect0126.pdf)
 gsomix	ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, but for the very first test just do something as simple as using alpha=-1 for negatively labeled examples and +1 otherwise for the directorkernelmachine
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. what about dotfeatures?
@sonney2k	and some random w vector in linear machines (b=0)
@sonney2k	gsomix, for directordotfeatures - best example would be to just implement all the required operations for some numpy double matrix
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.168.3.9] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
@sonney2k	gsomix, then you can run the code once using your director features and once using shogun's densefeatures
@sonney2k	and result should be the same
@sonney2k	gsomix, I started a directordotfeatures example - but it is not totally there yet
@sonney2k	gsomix, it might need some new operators in SGVector ( overload * / - + etc)
@sonney2k	+= / -= ...
@sonney2k	gsomix, got disconnected
@sonney2k	not sure if you've seen this
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> gsomix, then you can run the code once using your director features and once using shogun's densefeatures
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> and result should be the same
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> gsomix, I started a directordotfeatures example - but it is not totally there yet
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> gsomix, it might need some new operators in SGVector ( overload * / - + etc)
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> += / -= ...
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha
@sonney2k	gsomix, first line was gsomix, for directordotfeatures - best example would be to just implement all the required operations for some numpy double matrix
@sonney2k	gsomix, does that make sense?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. I think I'll start with dotfeatures.
@sonney2k	gsomix, can you fix the return 0 -> return false in your pull request
@sonney2k	I would then merge these
 gsomix	ah ^__^''
 gsomix	sonney2k, done

@sonney2k	gsomix, btw please use git commit --amend next time
@sonney2k	then push --force
 gsomix	sonney2k, mmm? why?
@sonney2k	gsomix, to avoid the useless fix
 gsomix	a, ok
@sonney2k	so one just has one OK commit
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey! can I double check with you an issue about the cutting plane algorithm we are using for SO??
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ask
 n4nd0	sonney2k: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/finley_joachims_08a.pdf take a look here to second page
 n4nd0	the algorithm, line 10
 n4nd0	and the gist here https://gist.github.com/2634487
 n4nd0	line 41
 n4nd0	in the paper it seems that they solve the QP each time they add a new constraint
 n4nd0	inside the for loop
 n4nd0	while in the gist it's outside the for loop
 n4nd0	I wonder if both are equivalent
 n4nd0	I am checking in some HMSVM code that Nico sent me and it seems to be done outside the for loop as well, like in the gist
 n4nd0	this may be the right solution then
@sonney2k	n4nd0, both will converge to the same solution
@sonney2k	n4nd0, only difference is speed
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and that really depends on the optimizer speed / argmax speed
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but it is clear - if you have zero costs for doing the optimization inside the loop then do it :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, and actually with cplex at least ( I guess mosek too) one can use the dual simplex method and 'hotstarts'
 n4nd0	n4nd0: I am still debugging, I think I have a bug somewhere since the weight vector learned is all zeros
 n4nd0	and I think that must be an error even if the dataset is so simply as the one I am using
 n4nd0	oh I am back to black ... talking to myself ^ :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well the trivial solution might mean that your example is too hard :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :) I think there's no way for that to happen, I have 17 training examples of two classes, data distributed as Gaussians
@sonney2k	n4nd0, why so many?
@sonney2k	why not 2 examples - one in each class?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I am going to try with that
 n4nd0	it seems funny though
@sonney2k	n4nd0, rule #1 try with the simplest possible case first
