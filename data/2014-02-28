 pranet	How do i invoke the tests after writing them?
@wiking	pranet: add the source to ./tests/unit/<whichever dir fits the best>/<classname>_unittest.cc
@wiking	and then just re-run cmake
@wiking	make sure u have -DENABLE_TESTING=ON given for cmake
@wiking	and after that just run make && ctest
 pranet	CMake Error at GoogleMock-stamp/download-GoogleMock.cmake:9 (file):   file DOWNLOAD HASH mismatch      for file: [/home/pranet/Desktop/shogun/third_party/GoogleMock/gmock-1.7.0.zip]       expected hash: [073b984d8798ea1594f5e44d85b20d66]         actual hash: [ceaac066cbd0538f22a32ceda8ab4e2e]    make[2]: *** [GoogleMock/src/GoogleMock-stamp/GoogleMock-download] Error 1 make[1]: *** [tests/unit/CMakeFiles/GoogleMock.dir/all] Error 2

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	ok, so lets go
 lisitsyn	sure lets go
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so could you quickly go over the contents? and add stuff if you have something in mind?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: sure I am on it now
@HeikoS	haha I can see you typing :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats a research fund by the EU
@HeikoS	http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: haha your part is soo materialistic :D
 lisitsyn	no communism at all
 lisitsyn	all about money
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	jk
@HeikoS	why is that?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: this part about poor students get money
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay I actually like the idea of an two-side interview
 lisitsyn	it would be pretty cool if we manage to find right words
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: lets collect ideas then just talk
 lisitsyn	'talk'
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I agree, first content, then red line then Ill write it up!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: will you write 'my' words as well? ;)
 lisitsyn	I don't mind though
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats fine :)
 lisitsyn	I am ok to build it up together
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I'll remove vodka part - I like whiskey :D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	indeed
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe let us write down the questions together
@HeikoS	and then each of us can answer seperately
@HeikoS	this way we will be faster :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay about mentoring
 lisitsyn	we can just say we are so busy we can't remember
 lisitsyn	what each other of us did
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	Ok, while you go over it, I will write up some questions
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  yes

@HeikoS	lambday: half :)
@HeikoS	lambday: how are things?
 lambday	HeikoS: surveying the code...
@HeikoS	lambday: how horrible is it? :)
 lambday	HeikoS: umm.. too soon to tell.. :) at a first glance, HSIC bootstrap_null uses its kernel-independence-test-statistic's bootstrap_null and that permutes the whole thing over p and q... so trying to think how to fit things when I split its parent class
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah the split basically implements the bootstrap_null (realy should be called l sample_null) differently
 lambday	HeikoS: let me check, I will get back with some queries..
@HeikoS	lambday: sure!
@HeikoS	lambday: btw dino and I have big plans for this project
@HeikoS	with paper and loads of experiments being done with the implementation etc :)
 lambday	HeikoS: great! :D the topic is really appealing - so much to learn! will work hard!

 ahcorde	Hello, i'm working in the integration of Opencv and Shogun. I'm making a basic facial recognition example, as an entrance task (eigenfaces).  I have a SGMatrix<float64_t> featuresVector and I would like o use PCA, but when I execute     shogun::CPCA* pca = new shogun::CPCA(); pca->init(featuresVector) takes a long time. Any ideas? thank you
-!- lambday [67157d4e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.78] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 ahcorde	the featuresVector have two vector and 10304 features Images size ( 92x112)
-!- HeikoS1 [~heiko@nat-177-195.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 ahcorde	featureVector is CDenseFeatures sorry
 HeikoS1	ahcorde: ?

 ahcorde	I have a     CDenseFeatures<float64_t>*  and would like to use PCA with this matrix,   but when I execute CPCA::init takes a long time.
 HeikoS1	ahcorde: how big is your matrix?
 HeikoS1	what are the dimensions?
 ahcorde	10304 features x 2 vectors
 HeikoS1	just two vectors?
 HeikoS1	PCA cannot help you with 2 vectors
 HeikoS1	or do you do that for a test only?
 HeikoS1	ahcorde: we actually will soon update our PCA implementation to deal with D>>N problems efficiently, the current one takes a long time for such a problem
 HeikoS1	ahcorde: there is an GSoC entry task on that in our github issue list, have a look

 HeikoS1	ahcorde: what do you mean?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS1: hey it looks ready
 lisitsyn1	okay I am powering off
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS1: thanks a lot!
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn1:  ok sleep well  Ill take care of the rest
 HeikoS1	thanks for helping!
