@wiking	besser82: ping? do you have maybe mint linux chroot ? :)
@besser82	wiking, nope :(
@besser82	wiking, but i think debootstrap might be able to generate some...
@wiking	besser82: mmm how can i get buildbot for centos7?
@wiking	pip install?
@besser82	lemme check...
@wiking	since it doesn't seem to have a package for it
@besser82	wiking, I'll take care of it...  There is currently no branch for build bot in EPEL7...  I'll request one, but it might take up until Tue for the rpms to show up in the repos...
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	python pip will just make me one :)
@besser82	wiking, thats the other possiblility...
@besser82	wiking, but installing from rpm seems to be better intergrated...

 khalednasr	lisitsyn, hey
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: so did you talk to theo?
@lisitsyn	anything you've decided I don't know about?
@lisitsyn	:)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, yeah, nothing new, I just updated him on what I did in the last period :)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, I'm adding convolutional autoencoders to the autoencoder notebook now, gonna send a PR soon
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: alright cool
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: what else has to be done?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, not sure, maybe some c++ examples?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: probably
@lisitsyn	though I don't know
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I mean is there anything theo wants to see before the project ends?
@lisitsyn	or we are ok already?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn, nope, no new algorithms. Although getting neuralnets to work with gpus would be good, but I'm not sure if there's time for that
