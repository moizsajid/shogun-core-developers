 lisitsyn	sanuj: hey there
 sanuj	lisitsyn, hi
 sanuj	ssup
 lisitsyn	any news? :)
 sanuj	nothing new :(
 sanuj	i was trying to train a CNN.....will start working on plugins in a while
 lisitsyn	ok I see
 sanuj	lisitsyn, you interested in quantum computers?
 sanuj	:)
 lisitsyn	sanuj: not really :D

@wiking	leagoetz: wazzawazza
@wiking	leagoetz: we should create some fancy queries for github
@wiking	to monitor the health of our students ;)
@wiking	submitted + merged prs
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	wiking, mine https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC%202016%20project%20%20%20New%20Parameter%20Framework%20and%20Plugin%20Architecture
@wiking	sanuj: ?
@wiking	ok 50% of the 4.2.0 release tickets are closed/fixed :)
 leagoetz	wiking: hello
 sanuj	wiking, stuff that i'm supposed to complete before coding period starts
 sanuj	which reminds me.....
 leagoetz	I kind of like the idea but we don't really want to micromanage them ... self-initiative is better
 sanuj	wiking, lisitsyn i need to plan a precise timeline for my project
 leagoetz	sanuj: aha, someone actually reads my emails :)
 sanuj	leagoetz, :D
 lisitsyn	ok yeah
@wiking	leagoetz: is Heiko or Rahul around you?
@wiking	if so plz kick their chair and tell them to respond to my pings
 sanuj	we have a shogun club brewing in UCL
 sanuj	haha
 leagoetz	wiking: I think they're in a talk (just met them for lunch, haha)
 leagoetz	that said, probably means Heiko has time now ;P
@wiking	leagoetz: ok so tell him to ping merge and reply
@wiking	:>
@wiking	thnx
 leagoetz	done
@wiking	thnx thnx

@wiking	yep
@wiking	:)
 lisitsyn	good
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: but checking spam as a regular folder of your mail

@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@HeikoS	my chair apparently was kicked ;)
@HeikoS	leagoetz is quite violent
 sanuj	lol
 sanuj	li
 sanuj	lisitsyn,
 sanuj	what's this
 sanuj	template <typename T>
 sanuj	T call(const std::string& name)
 sanuj	{
 sanuj	T (*fm)();
 sanuj	*(void**)(&fm) = dlsym(handle, name.c_str());
 sanuj	if (!fm)
 sanuj	throw std::logic_error("Haven't found method " + name);
 sanuj	return fm();
 sanuj	}
 sanuj	lisitsyn, dlsym gives pointer to name in the loaded plugin lib?
 lisitsyn	pointer to function
 sanuj	yeah
 lisitsyn	sanuj: it calls it then
 sanuj	lisitsyn, why void**
 lisitsyn	sanuj: well that's how dlsym works
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	returns void*
 sanuj	i see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  jojo
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: did you see rahuls email on openmp?
@HeikoS	any ideas?
 sanuj	HeikoS, what are you guys upto?
@HeikoS	sanuj: hi there
 sanuj	hello :)
@HeikoS	there is issues with eigen3 inside openmp loops
@HeikoS	sanuj: how is the planning going?
@HeikoS	all ready to get coding?
 sanuj	yep
 sanuj	swig interface is working for my tags prototype
 sanuj	playing with plugins now
@HeikoS	great
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	how do you register parameters in there?
 sanuj	i save it in an unordered_map
 sanuj	i have a draft
@HeikoS	sanuj: very excited to see this in action, recently started using shogun for a research project and cant wait to only compile my own plugin during development
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool!
 sanuj	https://gist.github.com/sanuj/3a343c8a31c4e9a4c657
@HeikoS	sanuj: how do you represent data type etc?

@HeikoS	sanuj: this prototype is for simple parameters
@HeikoS	how will you do it for arrays?
@HeikoS	btw you should talk to OXPHOS as well for her ersialization
@HeikoS	which is based on smart pointers
 sanuj	oh
 sanuj	haven't thought about arrays
 sanuj	should ask lisitsyn about that
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	what
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have
 lisitsyn	let me check it again
 lisitsyn	a bit later
 lisitsyn	what's about arrays?
@HeikoS	sanuj: SGVector, SGMAtrix, SGString, SGSparseVector
 lisitsyn	I see no difference
 sanuj	yeah
 lisitsyn	but yes
 shogun-buildbot	build #6 of xenial - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/xenial%20-%20libshogun/builds/6  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>
 lisitsyn	please add it
 sanuj	it should work for objects also
 lisitsyn	just export a few more types
 sanuj	i'll add
@HeikoS	sanuj: cool
@HeikoS	would be great to get OXPHOS ceral demo working within this
@HeikoS	can you push her a bit to do that with you prototype?
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'll get in touch with OXPHOS
 sanuj	when she is here
@HeikoS	sanuj: can we have obtain_from_generic for every class using your framewokr btw?
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-239-147.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 sanuj	whats obtain_from_generic
@HeikoS	using your as<T>
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	think you have a base class that has a method
 sanuj	i need to add it in the draft
@HeikoS	CKernel* CBase::learn_kernel
 sanuj	its working in my repo
@HeikoS	and then it retunrs a GaussianKernel
@HeikoS	in python
@HeikoS	that will be under CKernel interface
@HeikoS	so need to "cast"
@HeikoS	CGaussianKernel::obtain_from_generic(ckernel_instance)
@HeikoS	which gives an object under CGaussianKernel interface (if possible)
@HeikoS	see what I mean?
@HeikoS	check CGaussianKernel for example
@HeikoS	then you see
@HeikoS	it is a cast like operation
@HeikoS	but it works from SWIG
 sanuj	HeikoS,  obj.get("num").asInt()
 sanuj	^ it's working
 sanuj	i haven't added it to my draft yet
@HeikoS	base.get("learnt_kernel").asObject("CGaussianKernel")
@HeikoS	?
 sanuj	should work
@HeikoS	cool, yeah add it, would be curious to see
@HeikoS	would be good to add an example to your swig code for that
 sanuj	only have swig bindings for asInt asFloat and asString currently
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	would be cool to add then :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, yes :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'm trying to understand the plugin part in lisitsyn's aer
@HeikoS	I see
 lisitsyn	NO
 lisitsyn	base.get("learnt_kernel").asObject("CGaussianKernel")
 lisitsyn	not possible
 sanuj	oh
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: can we ge tit?
 lisitsyn	base.get("learnt_kernel").asKernel()
 lisitsyn	this way
 lisitsyn	no cgaussiankernel
@HeikoS	what does this return?
@HeikoS	which interface when I do from Python?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: when are you coming to London?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: whats with the website
@HeikoS	>:-D
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: asKernel returns CKernel
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you use CKernel interface
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not sure yet
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: out of time, trying to get some
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but how to get CGaussianKernel?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no worries
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: not possible
@HeikoS	joking
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but how to we mimic the obtain_From_generic thne?
 lisitsyn	you can't operate on cgaussiankernel
 lisitsyn	there is no such thing as gaussian kernel for you
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
 lisitsyn	you just know it is a kerel
@HeikoS	so it would be
 lisitsyn	kernel
 lisitsyn	you can get a list of its parameters
@HeikoS	base.get("learnt_kernel").asKernel().get("width")
@HeikoS	ah great, that is even better
@HeikoS	user doesnt need to know about classes
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	exactly
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool sorry I remember we talked about this
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok one more question
 lisitsyn	no worries
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ^also to you
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	the shogun ML interface
@HeikoS	should better be better than the current one
@HeikoS	needs a lot of iterations
@HeikoS	whats the state of that?
@HeikoS	sanuj: I added some comments in a gist that sergey put up a while ago
 sanuj	okay the shogun-base class list
@HeikoS	sanuj: needs some mining of what we have in shogun and what there should be
@HeikoS	classes of algos
@HeikoS	features
@HeikoS	etc etc
@HeikoS	thats quite tricly
@HeikoS	tricky
 sanuj	wiking told me to find abstract classes( and their parents) and add them to the list
@HeikoS	so better start a discussion on that soon as I expect this will cause quite a headache
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	exactly
@HeikoS	a nice class hierarchy
@HeikoS	with basic methods
 sanuj	that gist is a .i file...we were planning to have renames of all classes in base-shogun
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	but before we can write this class interace list
@HeikoS	we need a list of algorithm classes
@HeikoS	this comes first
 sanuj	yeah i saw your comments
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	make sure to get that going soon
 sanuj	will work on that tonight
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	looking forward to see
@HeikoS	wow big changes
@HeikoS	scary
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	sure
 sanuj	how come lisitsyn's all ideas fall into place for the new shogun interface
@HeikoS	sanuj: btw, also want to add another cookbook entry? :D
 sanuj	HeikoS, yeah
@HeikoS	(sorry for asking all these things, but feeling demandy today)
 sanuj	GMMs before coding begins
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	GMM is good
 sanuj	i asked about it before and you replied
@HeikoS	also a good example of how the base interface is important
@HeikoS	since GMM is a mixture distribution
 sanuj	haven't started writing it but will do soon....will take some iterations to merge
@HeikoS	that takes Gaussians as input
@HeikoS	and we need like log_pdf, grad, log_pdf_multiple
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	meta example is first step
@HeikoS	sanuj: was it you who added the linear ridge regression back then?
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	i added SVM too
 sanuj	3 in total
@HeikoS	sanuj: check my last commit
 sanuj	okay
@HeikoS	I think that might be needed for gmm too
@HeikoS	i.e. guarding the meta examples in the test build if some requirement is not met
 sanuj	ohkay
@HeikoS	minor thing, I also added it to the readme
@HeikoS	just to keep the buildbot happy
@HeikoS	sanuj: ok it is looking good then
@HeikoS	thanks for the updates
 sanuj	okay :)
 sanuj	cool
@HeikoS	sanuj: oh another thin
 sanuj	yeah tell :)
@HeikoS	you can think a bit about whether the meta example grammar has to be changed for plugins
 sanuj	hmm
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	gotta run, see you later
 sanuj	but that is later when we have the new interface
 sanuj	?
 sanuj	HeikoS, ^

 sanuj	have you also written any plugin for this arch?
 sanuj	yes
 lisitsyn	no
 sanuj	okay

 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	how shall i proceed now from here
 sanuj	if i take your plugin arch
 lisitsyn	well take any algo
 lisitsyn	liblinear
 lisitsyn	or anything
 sanuj	and make plugin for that?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, heiko was also saying to add objects in my tag prototype
 sanuj	like SGVector etc
 sanuj	shall i take those classes from shogun and add them?
