 bb	hi does any one have issues importing modshogun module in spyder python editor
 bb	spyder python interpretor is not able to execute the from modshogun import * line and fails
 lisitsyn2	bb: does that work in 'pure' python?
 lisitsyn2	w/o any ide?
 bb	lisitsyn yes it does on mac terminal
 lisitsyn2	bb: has to be something with paths or may be virtualenv
 lisitsyn2	don't know whether spyder uses it but it could be the culprit
 bb	lisitsyn i am adding the path to the spyder editor using PYTHONPATH manager to the following location "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 bb	lisitsyn is this the correct location
 lisitsyn2	bb: not sure! it is correct for linux but not sure about mac
 bb	lisitsyn2 this is the place i added and it works natively on macs shell
