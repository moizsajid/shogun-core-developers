@wiking	ok	12:45
@wiking	org.shogun-toolbox.* or ml.shogun.*	12:45
@wiking	as java pkgs?	12:45

CaBa	wiking: heya	12:57
CaBa	oh	12:57
CaBa	HeikoS: hey, you happen to be around?	12:58
@HeikoS	CaBa: hi yes	12:58
CaBa	HeikoS: remember when we were talking the other day about kernel functions that depend not only on something that cannot be plugged into a CFeature class, but for example index structures and things to speed up the computation of K(x_1, x_2)? And you said one solution would be to precalc the kernel matrix and use CCustomKernel but that that would not support e.g. normalizers?	13:00
@HeikoS	yes	13:00
@HeikoS	i remember	13:00
@wiking	CaBa, yes	13:00
@wiking	hi	13:01
@HeikoS	wiking:  my plan for today: write GSoc projects	13:01
@HeikoS	wiking: you got some bullet points on that?	13:01
@HeikoS	same projects as last year more or less? ;)	13:01
CaBa	HeikoS: i know this is dirty, but would this work: use CDenseFeatures<size_t>, 1-dimensional, the size_t value actually being an index for a feature vector... then derive from CKernel, override ::compute(), which then performs lookups according to the size_t feature in the "real" kernel matrix and returns the value. that would be a fully functional kernel, wouldnt it? one that supports subsetting and therefor	13:04
CaBa	e x-val, normalization during x-val, MKL, etc? no restrictions?	13:04
@HeikoS	yes that would work	13:06
@HeikoS	but it is a hack	13:06
@HeikoS	as your kernel would only work with this very specialized features	13:06
@HeikoS	generally, if you implement subsetting on kernel and features, then you can do anything you like and it will work	13:07
@HeikoS	"anything you like" as in override methods in a weird way	13:07
CaBa	HeikoS: well the features wouldn't be visible to the user - just like in CCustomKernel. The kernel would just take a precomputed matrix in it's constructor.	13:07
@HeikoS	sure	13:07
CaBa	HeikoS: it would be kind of a hacky replacement for CCustomKernel that supports normalization	13:08
@HeikoS	what I mean is that you have the inheritance diagram, and there two leafs (i.e. specialized classes) depend on one another	13:08
@HeikoS	which is against OOP paradigma	13:08
@HeikoS	but yeah	13:08
@HeikoS	I see your need for hacks ;)	13:08
@HeikoS	would be a cool thing to do as part of a GSoC project on x-validation and modelselection	13:09
CaBa	my need for hacks? ^^	13:09
@HeikoS	you seem to have this complicated kernel	13:10
@HeikoS	btw did you ever think about just not normalising the x-validation kernel matrices?	13:10
@HeikoS	i.e. just normalise your precomputed kernel matrix?	13:10
CaBa	sure, but it's a different thing	13:10
@HeikoS	or is it really crucial?	13:11
CaBa	i don't know if it's relevant	13:11
@HeikoS	I could also btw imagine some on-the-fly normalisation that works with custom kernels	13:11
@wiking	HeikoS, ah man	13:11
@wiking	i have to remember all those good ideas	13:11
@wiking	we have in the parking lot	13:11
@wiking	:D	13:11
@HeikoS	wiking: yes that is what I am asking :)	13:11
@HeikoS	wiking: I have a few things	13:11
@HeikoS	but before I tell them, I wanted to ask to get more coverage	13:11
@wiking	HeikoS, btw we need to rename our java package... it's either org.shogun-toolbox.* or ml.shogun.*	13:12
@wiking	as we do not own org.shogun	13:12
@wiking	i mean shogun.org	13:12
@HeikoS	uh, nice	13:12
CaBa	btw - do you know whether per-kernel sqrt-diag normalization is sufficient in MKL to get interpretable subkernel weights? or if other means of normalization are necessary?	13:12
@wiking	HeikoS, so we need to make a decision here...	13:12
@HeikoS	CaBa: for xvalidation, you dont need interpretable weights or do you?	13:12
@HeikoS	wiking: ml.shogun	13:13
@wiking	ok	13:13
@HeikoS	CaBa: or just with the final model	13:13
@wiking	i'll register	13:13
@wiking	lisitsyn, ^	13:13
@HeikoS	wiking: cool!	13:13
@HeikoS	CaBa: because if you just tune parameters using xvalidation, then maybe it is not that important	13:13
CaBa	HeikoS: that's what i'm wondering - will i just get different betas if i normalize afterwards but the subkernel parameters remain optimal?	13:14
@HeikoS	CaBa: probably it is worth a try	13:14
@HeikoS	but I dont know much about MKL	13:15
@HeikoS	and sonney2k who is the only one who knows, is busy with life	13:15
CaBa	HeikoS: life is a cool thing to be busy with ;)	13:18
@HeikoS	CaBa: so just to get you right	13:18
@HeikoS	CaBa: you want	13:18
@HeikoS	to use	13:18
@HeikoS	custom kernel + mkl + cross-validation + kernel normaliser	13:19
@HeikoS	maybe we can just make this an entrance task	13:19
@HeikoS	we got some students incoming for GSoC	13:19
@HeikoS	and this might be a nice non-trivial thing to work out	13:19
CaBa	that sounds about right	13:19
@HeikoS	so what we need here is that the kernel normalisation works with the subsetting and the mkl, all on the fly	13:20
CaBa	well... they hacky replacement for CCustomKernel I had in mind is a 30 min job I guess. But I'm sure you had something clean in mind :D	13:20
@HeikoS	yes sure, I mean for your purposes, the 30min hack might be ok	13:20
@HeikoS	but It is good for us to get such things done properly, in case somebody else also wants to use this kind of thing	13:21
CaBa	The only ting CCustomKernel lacks in that respect might be the normalization. Last time we spoke you said x-val and mkl might just work.	13:21
CaBa	But I didn't check that I must admit	13:21
lisitsyn	wiking: ml.shogun if we don't lost it again	13:24
lisitsyn	:)	13:24
@wiking	lisitsyn, i've bought it for 5 years :)	13:25
lisitsyn	org.shogun-toolbox is impossible	13:25
lisitsyn	would be	13:25
lisitsyn	org.shogun_toolbox	13:25
lisitsyn	superfuckingugly	13:25
@wiking	yes	13:26
CaBa	SG_REF checks for nullptr, right?	13:31
@HeikoS	yes	13:32
@HeikoS	but best read the def	13:32
CaBa	what's that deprecated info in the wiki? is there a replacement?	13:32
@HeikoS	?	13:33
@HeikoS	ah	13:33
@HeikoS	no :)	13:33
CaBa	^^	13:33
@sukey	Pull Request #3608 "Clean up KNN"  synchronized by MikeLing - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608	14:10
mikeling	hi, i got a bunch of undocument warning and failed to build python modular https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8974089	14:41
-!- praisethemoon [~praisethe@197.3.11.178] has joined #shogun	14:56
mikeling	wiking: ping	15:20
@wiking	pong	15:22
mikeling	wiking: after I pull docker image, how could I use python interface?	15:22
mikeling	on the image i mean	15:23
@wiking	- docker run -t -d -P -e "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle" -e "CC=$CC" -e "CXX=$CXX" --name devenv -v $PWD:/opt/shogun shogun/shogun-dev /bin/sh -c "mkdir /opt/shogun/build;bash"	15:23
@wiking	- docker exec -t devenv /bin/sh -c "cd /opt/shogun/build; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/shogun-build -DENABLE_TESTING=ON $CMAKE_OPTIONS .."	15:23
@wiking	where CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DPythonModular=ON -DTRAVIS_DISABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON -DTRAVIS_DISABLE_LIBSHOGUN_TESTS=ON"	15:23
mikeling	and pip install shogun-ml doesn't work, it looks like there is no package named  shogun-ml?	15:24
@wiking	pip install?	15:26
@wiking	why do you want pip install when you try a local development	15:26
mikeling	i just see that on document and want to have a try	15:26
@wiking	ah forget it	15:27
@wiking	it needs further fixing	15:27
@wiking	hopefully 5.1.0 will have it	15:27
mikeling	ok ;)	15:27
mikeling	wiking: It says "CMake Error: The source directory "/opt/shogun" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt. Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI."	15:50
@wiking	ok	15:50
@wiking	look i'll write this the one time	15:50
@wiking	docker run -t -i -v <the path to your checked out source>:/opt/shogun shogun/shogun-dev /bin/bash	15:51
@wiking	(now you are in docker)	15:51
@wiking	cd /opt/shogun	15:51
@wiking	mkdir build	15:51
@wiking	cd build	15:51
@wiking	cmake .... (all the stuff above)	15:51
@wiking	make	15:51
@HeikoS	mikeling: is there anything that is not documented?	15:54
mikeling	HeikoS: yep, part of warning is in https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8974116	15:55
@HeikoS	I mean as in documented installation process on our website	15:56
@HeikoS	these are just warnings	15:56
mikeling	HeikoS: oh, the pip install shogun-ml doesn't work	15:56
mikeling	it seems like shogun package is missing	15:56
@HeikoS	mikeling: I think I dont understands what you are actually doing there. these were just 3 very unrelated things (docker, pip install, cmake)	15:59
mikeling	HeikoS: because I would like to install the python interface of shogun, after I failed to build it from source code locally, I switch to the pip install but it looks like missing shogun-ml package for it	16:01
mikeling	and now, I want to use docker to solver my problem	16:01
mikeling	BTW, the error message is /bin/sh: line 1: 13156 Segmentation fault: 11  /usr/local/bin/doxygen modshogun.doxy when I build python interface locally	16:04
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@untrust-out.swc.ucl.ac.uk] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]	16:05
mikeling	And here is the Cmake I used " cmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib  -DPythonModular=ON ../"	16:05
@wiking	mikeling, ?	16:08
@wiking	wtf	16:08
@wiking	i told you how you can do it with the dokcer	16:08
@wiking	but you can do the same way on your osx	16:08
@wiking	cmake -DPythonModular=ON  ..	16:09
@wiking	make	16:09
@wiking	either way works	16:09
mikeling	wiking: yeah, I can do the same thing on osx, but it doesn't work for me, at least it failed on locally without docker	16:12
@wiking	what's the failure?	16:12
@wiking	btw without your patches	16:12
@wiking	or with your patches?	16:12
mikeling	without my pr	16:13
mikeling	s /bin/sh: line 1: 13156 Segmentation fault: 11  /usr/local/bin/doxygen modshogun.doxy	16:13
mikeling	without the "s", sorry	16:13
@wiking	brew info doxygen	16:13
mikeling	doxygen: stable 1.8.13 (bottled), HEAD	16:14
@wiking	git git rev-parse HEAD	16:16
@wiking	?	16:16
@wiking	but in worst case you can disable doxygen and do it without that	16:17
mikeling	you mean git rev-parse HEAD?	16:17
@wiking	yes	16:18
mikeling	it's 9673755bdb345b3c10fe447425394e4813f06dd8	16:18
@wiking	mmm i've just ran on my osx	16:18
@wiking	and i dont get segfault	16:18
mikeling	and here is my cmake output https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8974123	16:18
@wiking	-- Found NumPy: version "1.12.0" /usr/local/Cellar/matplotlib/2.0.0/libexec/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include?	16:18
@wiking	this doesn't look too good	16:19
mikeling	hmmm, so you think it may case a segfault?	16:20
@wiking	noup	16:20
@wiking	bu ti dont understand	16:20
@wiking	why the numpy is part of matplotlib	16:20
@wiking	pip list|grep numpy	16:20
@wiking	?	16:20
mikeling	it return numpy (1.12.0)	16:20
@wiking	pip show numpy	16:21
@wiking	?	16:21
mikeling	do you think docker can help me solve that segfault?	16:22
@wiking	with docker you would get exactly the same thing	16:22
@wiking	what happens on travis	16:22
@wiking	as it's the same env	16:22
mikeling	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/keyKp2ID/	16:22
@wiking	yeah i have no idea why it is landing in Location: /usr/local/Cellar/matplotlib/2.0.0/libexec/lib/python2.7/site-packages	16:23
@wiking	but ok...	16:23
mikeling	so I just working around this segfault for whole day and no idea why it happened and how to fix it	16:24
@wiking	brew uninstall doxygen	16:26
@wiking	and try it w/o that	16:26
mikeling	ok, let me have a try	16:26
mikeling	wiking: Oh my mine, it works.......	16:36
mikeling	after remove doxygen	16:36
mikeling	thank you very much	16:39
