 sonney2k	yoh, around?
 yoh	now - yes
 yoh	sonney2k: above ;)
 yoh	but my screen with IRC is burried deep - so do not get surprised if I do not respond immediately

 sonney2k	yoh, *sigh* my machine froze - in case you answered please pong again
 yoh	sonney2k: answered to what? that I am here? yes I am ;)
 sonney2k	yes
 sonney2k	I am trying to do the git conversion https://github.com/shogun-toolbox
 sonney2k	I've split out data and source code to actually not waste to much hard disk space /bandwith
 sonney2k	yoh, would be great if you could check it out and give comments
 sonney2k	(I will now have to fix all the many scripts / makefile etc to work with git)
-!- sonney2k [~sonney2k@no.ml.tu-berlin.de] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 yoh	ok -- will check it in 30mins, ok?
 yoh	for some reason github became slow on my in the last few days
 yoh	I saw their recent blog only on 'improved' performance.
 yoh	initial throughput is high but then it drops considerably :-/
-!- Tanmoy [75d35896@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun
 yoh	btw -- not sure if that would matter if pushed back to github: if I repack local clone -- size of .git goes from 200MB to 118MB
 yoh	have you repacked it before pushing to github?

 yoh	what is that really dangling tag for genefinder_0_1_0?
 sonney2k	yoh, the mighty roots of shogun
 sonney2k	we started out to write yet another genefinder
 yoh	but it seems to be without a tree ;) (no files etc) -- why to keep it?
 sonney2k	but for some reason we are taking looong shortcuts :)
 sonney2k	yoh, it has files here!?
 yoh	1 sec
 sonney2k	however I don't really know how to access the tag...
 yoh	ah sorry -- yes
 yoh	files are there
 yoh	the same way -- you can check it out
 sonney2k	beyond my git skills
 yoh	I just got confused in gitk a bit ;)
 sonney2k	well git checkout <tag> makes me git tell me that I am in detached head state
 yoh	you might have rewritten that commit though with some useful message ;)
 yoh	yes- - because tag is not a branch
 yoh	if you like  to get it into branch, just do "git checkout -b branch-for-tagX tagX"
 sonney2k	then it is a local branch right?
 sonney2k	yoh, ahh how do I get rid of untracked files?
* sonney2k *sigh* once again /me is a newbie
 sonney2k	cool stuff https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/graphs/impact
 yoh	sonney2k: you mean in the local checkout?
 sonney2k	yoh, yes
 yoh	most oopportunistic 'git clean -dfx'
 yoh	and I would recommend to have data not as a symlink but as a git submodule
 sonney2k	yoh, did you find anything suspicious otherwise?
 sonney2k	how to do that?
 yoh	it does take a bit to get used to but it is the correct way to bind tw o repositories together e.g. so you could assure specific revision of data for specific release of shogun
 yoh	git rm data
 yoh	mkdir data
 yoh	actually let me just do it and then give you a list of commands ;)
 sonney2k	k
 yoh	damn... need to leave atm (help doing MRI scanning)... will do later today
 sonney2k	yoh, enjoy
 sonney2k	l8r

 yoh	btw -- wanna see big tree of your git: *** "mod:pickle/cPickle modules" doesn't render nicely ;)
 yoh	oops -- wrong paste
 yoh	http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/big.pdf
 yoh	sonney2k: eh -- you are offline again so no reason for me to type on instructions with gitsubmodules -- will send you an email with the log

 sonney2k	yoh, I was riding the train back home again and had to switch to a bike...
 sonney2k	(it is still hard for me to stay online while biking ;)
 yoh	I would recommend running some console base IRC client (e.g. irssi) in a screen on some always-online box, so you could always be omnipresent and get all the messages pepople write to you while you are physically offline
 sonney2k	yoh, that is what shogun-toolbox is...
 sonney2k	yoh, I did the submodule thing
 sonney2k	not sure if I like it that much though
 sonney2k	it forces people to get the data submodule
 sonney2k	whcih is pretty big compared to the src
 yoh	no -- if they just clone shogun repo -- nobody forces them to do submodule update ;)
 yoh	src is as big atm
 yoh	wanted to test either pushing repacked repository to github would reduce the size on github .... but will need to go offline soon, so will check later
 sonney2k	yoh, you mean git gc?
 yoh	no
 yoh	git repack
 yoh	in particular I usually do git repack -a -d -f --window=100
 sonney2k	OK running
 yoh	git gc should not hurt either ;) especially if you removed any unneeded branches
 sonney2k	however I did that already after svn2git
 yoh	ah
 sonney2k	I didn't
 sonney2k	but hey I am happy that the tags are there just fine
 sonney2k	and the branches too
 yoh	;-)
 sonney2k	your git repack brings it down 80MB
 yoh	ok -- need to go now -- TTYL ... play with submodule idea -- you might like it at the end ;)
 yoh	;)
 sonney2k	now 480MB in checkout
 sonney2k	yoh, it is already commited like this
 yoh	told ya ... well -- it should not impact checkout. but only size of .git
 sonney2k	yeah but how do I upload the repacked thing to github?
 yoh	;) that is the question... I asked on github irc but no asnwer yet if it would be of effect:  remove old one, init it, push a new one
 yoh	since shasums are the same -- no one should mention anything if they already cloned it ;)
 yoh	now I am gone

 sploving	sorry to boter you
 sploving	bother
 sonney2k	sploving, check www.shogun-toolbox.org

 sonney2k	alternatively I am in the process of moving things to git https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 sonney2k	so you could use that as well
 sploving	ok i know. thx
 Tanmoy	moving to github is pretty cool
 sonney2k	yeah... much easier for gsoc
 sonney2k	but it is quite some effort ...

 Tanmoy	off to sleep
 yoh	sonney2k: btw -- have you considered pruning data files from the history of the repository entirely?
 yoh	sonney2k: btw -- tested upload of the repacked repository -- cloning became faster and size remained at 118MB -- coolio
