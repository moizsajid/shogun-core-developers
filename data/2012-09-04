@sonney2k	blackburn, morning
 blackburn	sonney2k: morgen
 blackburn	sonney2k: or even ?????? ????!
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	so we are ready right? all that is left is run the make release script
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you take a look on content_sensor.py in msplicer?
@sonney2k	blackburn, unfixable...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't manage to get it back to work
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah okay then we should be ready
@sonney2k	jonas/gunnar did hardcore changes but never cared to update msplicer (actually model retraining needed...)
@sonney2k	blackburn, make release is running...
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: what are working hours for you?
 blackburn	8.00 - 17.00?
@sonney2k	about that
@sonney2k	not before 8:30 though
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	I now understand why you get tired so 'early'
 blackburn	here most of developers get to job not before than 10.30 :D
@sonney2k	argh out of mem error compiling octave...
@sonney2k	do they have kids?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, 70% of them have
@sonney2k	*argh* I have to run make release from home... that just takes too long. so feel free to craft some announcement email etc
@sonney2k	or even edit the website :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is ETA?
 blackburn	I will kruft an announcement

 sonne|work	when I am home... not so early today
 blackburn	sonne|work: want to read announcement?
 sonne|work	blackburn: I don't mind
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw did you fix static tests yet?
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	completely missed
 blackburn	sonne|work: draft of an announcement is in your mail
 sonne|work	I would then say I run make release tonight once you fixed the static tests :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes makes senes
 blackburn	it is easy to fix
 blackburn	sonne|work: ahh we were asked to update features table
 sonne|work	we don't have it
 sonne|work	on the new website
 sonne|work	actually they should edit the google document and we need to tweak our script...
 blackburn	sonne|work: did you like the announcement? :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: I didn't receive anything yet
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	my gmail went crazy
 sonne|work	?
 sonne|work	ok received
 sonne|work	will send you  an update
-!- yoo [2eda6d52@gateway/web/freenode/ip.46.218.109.82] has joined #shogun
 yoo	hi all
 blackburn	hi
 yoo	how are you
 yoo	it has been a week almost !
 blackburn	heh fine, what about you?
 blackburn	yoo: we are preparing for release btw
 yoo	blackburn: nice
 yoo	blackburn: last week I came here to report a bug with MKL. With basic example, it seems that with p-norm >= 1, somthg wrong appended. Did som1 reproduce it ?
 blackburn	yoo: no not really
 yoo	could it be usefull that I re-share the code to reproduce the bug ?
 sonne|work	yoo: what happens?
 blackburn	yoo: yes please
 blackburn	okay I have to go to university
 yoo	sonne|work: hi. here is a sample code http://pastebin.com/E8rvpVPx
 sonne|work	yoo: what is the problem?
 yoo	sonne|work: the problem is when p-norm is >= 1. then depending on the order you call the cker->append(kernel) method then the results chenge and are wrong
 sonne|work	yoo: which solver?
 yoo	for example, in this case poly kernel should be assign to a small weight but placing it at the first place give 80% of the weights
 yoo	MKLMulticlass (based on GMNPSVM Multiclass SVM ?)
 sonne|work	yoo - does that happen with p-norm = 2 too?
 yoo	sonne|work: yes
 yoo	what other mkl solver can I test ?
 sonne|work	you don't happen to have cplex?
 yoo	no I dont have cplex
 yoo	could it be a normalization step missing ?
 sonne|work	yoo: well try with 3 gaussian kernels first
 sonne|work	(instead of your linear / poly)
 sonne|work	then you will know
 yoo	p=1 weights=[0.689040809888890382,0,0.310959190111109618]
 yoo	p=1.5 weights=[0.807664115129075988,0.372230937235915327,0.130329256359283385]
 yoo	p=1.5 (again and changing the order) weights=[0.760197211045205989,0.350354701974430915,0.256375284234867218]
 sonne|work	please use p=2 for testing here
 yoo	p=2 weights=[0.920187257990366603,0.347798092036156359,0.179699464128804831] (3 gaussian kernels)
 yoo	p=2 weights=[0.882496058989740262,0.333552157868777399,0.33157753821490854] (another run, changing kernels order)
 sonne|work	yoo: so what worries you is that changing order of kernels doesn't change weights in the same way right?
 yoo	yes, and first kernel always get almost 0.9
 sonne|work	yoo: it may happen though that weights change - however objective should not change. so either run things with debug output
 sonne|work	or print the objective at the end
 yoo	objective ?
 sonne|work	yoo: if you put that first kernel last?
 yoo	that's what I have done in the previous example (p=2)
 yoo	I tried also with 20 kernels and the first one get 0.8 and all the others 0.01
 yoo	even when I place the last kernel in the first place, he get 0.8%
 sonne|work	yoo: please run
 sonne|work	compute_mkl_primal_objective()
 sonne|work	compute_mkl_dual_objective()
 sonne|work	and print these numbers (after mkl got trained)
 yoo	compute_mkl_primal_objective() or compute_mkl_dual_objective() are not in the MKLMulticlass class ?
 sonne|work	ah mkl multiclass...
 yoo	yea (..) testing things on digits
 sonne|work	yoo: then no idea - you should ask alex when he is around (or directly per mail + cc mailinglist)
 yoo	allright. thx.
 yoo	could you give me his mail ?

@sonney2k	blackburn, back!
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay last things to do
 blackburn	do not make release yet - I am checking tester ow
@sonney2k	blackburn, hurry up...
 blackburn	just a few minutes
 blackburn	I am done with mail though
 blackburn	okay octave static
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok 5 minutes then we start no matter what
 blackburn	sonney2k: strangely it works here
 blackburn	but not on buildbot
@sonney2k	blackburn, what does not work
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/518/steps/test%20octave_modular/logs/stdio
 blackburn	cannot create instance, etc
 blackburn	no errors like that here
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is octave modular or?
 blackburn	sonney2k: static
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	modular
@sonney2k	running tests
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	blackburn, well fix it - but I am running make prepare release again......
 blackburn	sonney2k: nevermind it is a developer stuff
 blackburn	and only two developers care about that actually
 blackburn	so just do it

 blackburn	sonney2k: when?
 blackburn	no commits today
@sonney2k	blackburn, so it is the state of yesterday?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, no fixes in static interfaces right?
@sonney2k	nah whatever - it won't get better than that.
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think modular octave is broken at all?
 blackburn	I thought only tester
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	make check-examples works it seems
 blackburn	then I don't care
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you give me twitter acc?
@sonney2k	hmmhh my make release script is still b0rken
@sonney2k	yes (not from here though)

@sonney2k	n4nd0, and you too!
 n4nd0	sonney2k: all right
@sonney2k	try to download shogun etc this stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: news are old still
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how do I update the NEWS thing?
@sonney2k	heh
 n4nd0	weblog doesn't show anything here but I think that is normal, the draft page was like that too
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you remove mobile version thing?
 bern4rd	write the xml with the new in the folder and the next time someone uses /home url will be loaded
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how?
@sonney2k	blackburn, bern4rd any idea where that mobile version thing is?

 blackburn	oh
 bern4rd	the search box was also in nuvio template

 bern4rd	I didnt change them because i didnt know if you want to do anything with that or can be removed from the html
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is rpm1? it fails
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no it is new buidbot for redhat (we just set up!)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the link is called "available", it was not clear ^
 n4nd0	sonney2k: better then :)
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how do I create the XML for the news file?
 blackburn	sonney2k: !!! release!
 blackburn	:D
 bern4rd	you have several models in /data/news/
 bern4rd	this is the last new : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web/blob/master/news/2012/2012-09-01
@sonney2k	bern4rd, yeah but how do I create that file?
 bern4rd	Is just a text file
@sonney2k	bern4rd, so?
 bern4rd	you dont need special names, but anyway i am using the date
@sonney2k	bern4rd, I thought this is generated from the NEWS file?
 bern4rd	you mean the news file with all the news that is in github?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, did you say anything?
 n4nd0	I was just joking :)
 blackburn	I am sending it!
 blackburn	you have last seconds to answer
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	bern4rd, how did you create all the files in news/ ?
 bern4rd	I have created the files in shogun-web with your NEWS file. But I did it manually.
@sonney2k	bern4rd :(
@sonney2k	that is what I was looking for
@sonney2k	*manually*
@sonney2k	not a good thing
@sonney2k	we need this automatically...
@sonney2k	anyway will do it manually now too
@sonney2k	bern4rd, when I just update the 2012-09-01 file - will it work?
 bern4rd	Yes, I understand now what you mean. When I arrive to Stockholm (Friday) I will try to change it to do it automatically. But I remember not all the news had the same format, and is better to parse something with xml format for example that parse from normal text files
 bern4rd	yes
@sonney2k	bern4rd, hmmhh they should all have the same format
@sonney2k	at least for the last years they should have the same
 bern4rd	I saw that you changed the time-zone to Berlin zone, I hope it wont be a problem
@sonney2k	why?
 bern4rd	yes the last years yes, the problem in the format is at the beginning
@sonney2k	bern4rd, well then just parse the first ones...
 bern4rd	oks.
 blackburn	okay I can't wait longer
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	hmmh website broken
 blackburn	gott!
 blackburn	wtf?
@sonney2k	hmmhh http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/information works
@sonney2k	but not the / url

@sonney2k	and one likely situation is that I visit him in NY
@sonney2k	he likes it
@sonney2k	heiko, question is - do we need some notar or something at the meeting?
 heiko	no
 heiko	we dont
@sonney2k	I mean we can easily get >7 people in a room and decide about the satzung etc
 heiko	one thing that nobody is sure about is if the meeting can be done online
@sonney2k	bern4rd, btw download links are not available for shogun-data!
 heiko	physically in a room?
@sonney2k	only for shogun src code
@sonney2k	heiko, yes... gunnar said there are quite a bit of shogun users in NY :D
 heiko	sonney2k, well this is nice then
 heiko	If you want, I can set up a document once I am finished with uni stuff here
 bern4rd	true, i'll add it
 heiko	sonney2k, what do you think about the email of the KDE president?
@sonney2k	heiko btw when did you edit NEWS?
@sonney2k	just now?
 heiko	he kind of said they usually discourage people from starting a e.V. because of the workload
 heiko	sonney2k, just tried a few minutes ago
@sonney2k	heiko, yeah seen that
@sonney2k	heiko, please try again...
@sonney2k	(though it is automatically updated...)
@sonney2k	heiko, how much work is it really?
@sonney2k	I thought one needs 'just' yearly rechenschaftsbericht?
 heiko	sonney2k, the documents are easy, yes that yearly thing
@sonney2k	I mean writing the satzung is a one time thing
 heiko	and we need to take care of money and stuff
@sonney2k	but then?
@sonney2k	what does one have to do?
 heiko	and getting the "geminn?tzig" from the finanzamt is kind of hard
 heiko	gemeinn?tzig
@sonney2k	heiko, which is not a burning topic though
@sonney2k	heiko, for this year we should route the money through you -
 heiko	true
@sonney2k	is that OK?
 heiko	yeah thats fine
@sonney2k	heiko, I will need you bank account, address and everthing...
@sonney2k	for google
@sonney2k	otherwise that won't work out
 heiko	I think its fine, I will check with my ensurance but I think its ok
@sonney2k	heiko, please do ASAP ... I am not even sure if it is not too late yet
 heiko	well, ok
 heiko	tomorrow then
 n4nd0	sonney2k: can we upload photos to twitter?

@sonney2k	heiko, regarding e.V. we need to find out what one has to do...

@sonney2k	heiko, ok that one is clear
