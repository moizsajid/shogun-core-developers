 wiking	sonne|osx: serialize all the possible objects into a file
 wiking	reads it
 sonne|osx	wiking: we really need a gdb trace
 wiking	and checks if it's equal
 wiking	sonne|osx: couldn't find such option for ctest yet
 sonne|osx	I have no clue how to debug this
 sonne|osx	wiking: no we can do it when running our test
 sonne|osx	wiking: like this
 wiking	sonne|osx: how... do u know the ctest command for it?
 sonne|osx	test
 wiking	btw: do you know how to create a tmpfs?
 sonne|osx	test || gdb test
 sonne|osx	wiking: isn't ctest just calling some commands
 sonne|osx	?
 wiking	afaik yes
 sonne|osx	so then it is easy
 sonne|osx	a test returns 0 if it worked fine
 sonne|osx	if not we can re-run the test with gdb
 sonne|osx	and voila!
 sonne|osx	this is how I did this when we had configure running
 sonne|osx	maybe you can do it a bit more beautiful by defining some cmake function that is encapsulating this?

 wiking	lambday: or u would need SparseFeatures<complex64_t> wrapper as well?
 wiking	lambday: plz comment what you've find out about the mapping (works/does work) at: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1493
 lambday	wiking: seems like I needed to add the sparse features thing after all, although it says features it actually works on sparse matrix
 lambday	earlier I couldn't make it work
 lambday	I added it
 lambday	and now it works
 lambday	SGVector<complex64_t> works perfectly by the way :) :)
 lambday	thanks a lot man :)
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so u need sparsefeatures as well?
 lambday	wiking: I will send a PR, with a few of my wrappers
 lambday	wiking: actually, no.. I only needed SGSparseMatrix<complex64_t> to work
 lambday	wiking: just a sec
 wiking	lambday: that should work
 wiking	although i have not tested it
 wiking	ComplexSparseMatrix
 lambday	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/interfaces/python_modular/swig_typemaps.i#L1216
 wiking	?
 lambday	when I added TYPEMAP_SPARSEFEATURES_OUT(complex64_t,     NPY_CDOUBLE), then it worked
 wiking	before that?
 lambday	didn't :(
 lambday	the macro is for SGSparseMatrix
 lambday	not CSparseFeatures
 lambday	:(
 wiking	In [1]: from modshogun import ComplexSparseMatrix
 wiking	In [2]: x = ComplexSparseMatrix()
 wiking	this works for me
 wiking	w/o that line
 wiking	make up your mind
 wiking	do u need SparseMatrix
 wiking	or SparseFeatures
 lambday	wiking: but I tried to pass a csc_matrix(complex) as an argument to a class which takes SGSparseMatrix<complex64_t> it didn't work
 lambday	I need sparse matrix
 wiking	csc_matrix(complex)?
 wiking	what's this?
 lambday	that's scipy.sparse matrix...
 lambday	for real types, I can seamlessly pass a csc_matrix to a shogun method that takes SGSparseMatrix<float64_t>
 lambday	for complex, I needed the same
 wiking	ok tell me the code that i can generate this scipy.sparse
 wiking	csc_matrix(complex
 lambday	wiking: wait..
 wiking	as you are talking way out of context

 lambday	its in numpy
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i have b now
 lambday	yeah
 wiking	what now?
 lambday	wiking: now what I needed was I needed to construct one of my class CSparseMatrixOperator<complex64_t> that takes a SGSparseMatrix<complex64_t> as an arg
 lambday	shit
 lambday	I added it locally you won't be able to access it
 lambday	what I need is that, I need to pass that csc_matrix to my class
 lambday	in the constructor
 lambday	locally it works now
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	CSparseMatrixOperator needs a mapping as well
 wiking	:)
 lambday	wiking: yeah I added that locally
 lambday	sending PR :)
 wiking	but i dont know how you can set the values of ComplexSparseMatrix
 wiking	:<
 wiking	in fact i dont know how u do that with ComplexMatrix either
 lambday	no idea!
 wiking	:P
 wiking	or RealMatrix
 wiking	how do you convert a numpy.matrix -> RealMatrix
 lambday	but if I pass a csc_matrix to a method that takes SGSparseMatrix as an arg, it works :D
 wiking	or RealSparseMatrix
 wiking	iglesiasg: btw i think it would be a good thing to enable director classes on that shogun install in the notebook server
@iglesiasg	wiking: using the image I guess, right?
 lambday	wiking: I am using wrappers for these, so in the constructor I pass csc_matrix, works fine
 wiking	iglesiasg: image?
 wiking	iglesiasg: what image do you mean?
@iglesiasg	wiking: to test the notebooks
 wiking	no comprende
@iglesiasg	haha
 wiking	elaborate plz
 wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	wiking: 11:41 < wiking> iglesiasg: well test it
 wiking	iglesiasg: ah no
 wiking	iglesiasg: haven't u received my email to shogun-team@ ?
@iglesiasg	nope
 wiking	weeeeird
@iglesiasg	that was the part of
@iglesiasg	developers have been sent blah blah I did not get
@iglesiasg	but it might have missed it
@iglesiasg	let me double check...
 wiking	ok let me know
 wiking	maybe it's still in greylist
 wiking	oooor i've sent from an address from which i'm not allowed to that list
 wiking	oh ok
 wiking	that's what happend
 wiking	let me resend it
 wiking	iglesiasg: sent again... let me know if u received now
@iglesiasg	wiking: received
 wiking	cool
 wiking	sorry about the fuckup
@iglesiasg	wiking: aah np
@iglesiasg	I love struggling with these little things :D
 wiking	ah shiiit
 wiking	we would need this
 wiking	Magics for temporary workspace
 wiking	https://github.com/tkf/ipython-tempmagic
@iglesiasg	testing the notebooks atm...
@iglesiasg	cool stuff
@iglesiasg	wiking: to ensure, so every time I run a cell
@iglesiasg	wiking: it is being executed in 7nn, right?
 wiking	yesp
 wiking	*yeps
@iglesiasg	sweet!
 wiking	the problem is that currently
 wiking	or not the problem
 wiking	but the fact is
@iglesiasg	it is saved
 wiking	that the directory where you enter (where the notebooks are)
 wiking	is readonly
@iglesiasg	why problem?
@iglesiasg	drawback?
 wiking	well
 wiking	can u add a new notebook now?

 wiking	so i suspect that u cannot add a new notebook
@iglesiasg	no.. I cant
 wiking	see
 wiking	that's the thing
@iglesiasg	400: Bad Request
 wiking	you can run the ones that are there
@iglesiasg	but hold on
 wiking	but you cannot add a new one
@iglesiasg	how do we want to handle that?
@iglesiasg	I mean
 wiking	well this magic shit
 wiking	should be able to do that
 wiking	creates a temp location
 wiking	and there you can write whatever
@iglesiasg	do we want people coming in creating notebooks and keeping them in our server?
 wiking	but then as soon as u log out
@iglesiasg	or just keeping them while they are logged in?
 wiking	it's cleaned up
 wiking	well
@iglesiasg	all right
 wiking	it'd be interesting to keep some
 wiking	i would say
@iglesiasg	that makes sense then
@iglesiasg	do you think so?
 wiking	maybe somebody does some interesting stuff
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	that person can send it to us
@iglesiasg	mmm yeah it could be
 wiking	since one can download the notebooks
@iglesiasg	we could train a classifier to keep the interesting ones :)
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	but anyhow i think 2013-09-20 09:50:58.338 [tornado.general] WARNING | 400 GET /new (91.64.72.127): Unexpected error while autosaving notebook: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: u'/home/notebook/notebooks/Untitled0.ipynb'
 wiking	so
 wiking	i think that we should try to use this magic shit
 wiking	but yeah test it and then send some feedbacks (this is not for you but *all*) and then i'll do the changes stilll
@iglesiasg	well I just realized that I need to update my notebook...
@iglesiasg	we deffs need to get custom data to the notebook somehow
@iglesiasg	wiking: btw, the first mail ipython notebook test mail you sent just arrived here xD

 iglesiasg	sonne|work: hi!
 sonne|work	hi
 iglesiasg	have you checked the notebooks?
 sonne|work	a bit
 iglesiasg	wiking did some stuff and we can already execute them
 iglesiasg	cool
 iglesiasg	sonne|work: any thought regarding getting data into the notebook?
 iglesiasg	I think we really need to provide that
 iglesiasg	the API could look like
 iglesiasg	features = RealFeatures(LocalFile('path/to/file/in/client/machine'))
 iglesiasg	and the same for the labels
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: we have that already
 iglesiasg	oh really?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: see examples RealFeatures(CSVFile('/path/to/file'))
 sonne|work	same with .h5
 sonne|work	and libsvm files
 iglesiasg	sonne|work: yeah yeah
 sonne|work	etc
 iglesiasg	but the ipython runs in 7nn!
 iglesiasg	so CSVFile('path/blahblah')
 iglesiasg	would look in 7nn's FS
 sonne|work	sure
 iglesiasg	what I am thinking about is that someone using the notebook
 iglesiasg	can choose what data to use from her machine
 sonne|work	and then?
 iglesiasg	?
 iglesiasg	well then she can do stuff in the notebook with that data
 sonne|work	what does he do if he has chosen some data
 sonne|work	that doesn't explain how to get the data
 sonne|work	to fatbot
 iglesiasg	yeah that's why I said API :)
 sonne|work	no idea what you say :/
 sonne|work	what does  features = RealFeatures(LocalFile('path/to/file/in/client/machine')) do
 sonne|work	where is this run?
 iglesiasg	LocalFile does stuff under the hood
 iglesiasg	sends the file
 iglesiasg	makes security checks
 iglesiasg	cheks for format
 iglesiasg	and finally load it in numpy array if everthing went fine
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well this is maybe 2 lines python then
 iglesiasg	sonne|work: even better then

@HeikoS	wiking: nice! just tried the could shogun :) aweseom!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: so in the example evaluation_cross_validation_classification.py
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: it says that StratifiedCrossValidation is better
@HeikoS	yes
@iglesiasg	but standard StratifiedCrossValidatoinSplitting is also available
@iglesiasg	I don't quite a get it
@HeikoS	you mean CrossValidationSplitting
@iglesiasg	ok
@HeikoS	sometimes one cannot do stratified
@iglesiasg	then you meant that :P
@HeikoS	for example in regression
@iglesiasg	I will update the example
@HeikoS	stratified should always be used with classification
@HeikoS	actually, we could think about doing something similar to stratified for regression, (grouping y values) but that would be later
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cool thanks!
@iglesiasg	oh I see
@iglesiasg	I guess this regression thing is related (though not limited) to GPs, right?

 votjakovr	HeikoS: i've used some trick there to make it possible to call SG_ADD with multiply arguments

@HeikoS	lambday: ok let me know
@HeikoS	nothing there yet
 lambday	HeikoS: just a few things.. incorporating the rest of the things
@HeikoS	lambday: okay, keep in mind that these are just suggestions :)
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah but this will make it look cool :)
 lambday	HeikoS: how do I display the cholesky factors? using cholmod?
 lambday	using shogun I cannot do that
@HeikoS	lambday: turn the matrix into dense and compute dense cholesky
@HeikoS	for the small one, that should work
 lambday	HeikoS: so, for west0479 I can do that
 lambday	and you want the putting it all together part pulled above
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah exactly
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah I think so
@HeikoS	all these solvers are not crucial for using the method
 lambday	nah
@HeikoS	more like an illustration how to use the tools you created
 lambday	yes
 lambday	alright..
@HeikoS	you can introduce that as "All the methods needed to estimate the log-determinants in the above way can also be used on their own
 lambday	ah that sounds great'
 lambday	HeikoS: oh one thing.. I didn't get that part when you said that the matrix I used for CG may not be psd
 lambday	I already did m^Tm+I
 lambday	and applied cg on that one
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	maybe I missed that
@HeikoS	sorry then
 lambday	where m is randomly generated
 lambday	HeikoS: np.. oh and where would these notebooks go? (so that I can put a relative path to the data, gotta add apache2 and ozone though)
@HeikoS	there is a directory for them ...
@HeikoS	in doc
 lambday	HeikoS: doc/ipython-notebooks
 lambday	found it
 lambday	LD
 lambday	:D
@HeikoS	lambday: just respect the directory structure for yours
 lambday	alright
 lambday	HeikoS: I wanted to add something for the ozone mcmc
 lambday	HeikoS: oh and one more thing... combining the normal and probing samplers is exactly what I did earlier
 lambday	HeikoS: but probing samplers have so less variance,that when I put it with Normal, it almost looks aligned with the actual logdet
@HeikoS	lambday: I see
 lambday	that's why kept these two separate
 lambday	:-/
@HeikoS	then do subplot(121) #plot normal subplot(122) #plot probing
@HeikoS	just do have them next to each other
@HeikoS	and plot histograms on top of each other
@HeikoS	would be cool to have a histogram like on the poster
@HeikoS	with both samples and the true value
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
 lambday	still new to this matplotlib, fighting a bit :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: can I add external images (that are not generated plots from the code) in the notebook?
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, but why do you want to do that?
@HeikoS	lambday: ask me if you have problems with plotting
 lambday	HeikoS: I wanted to put a CG-M convergence plot based on the residuals
@HeikoS	lambday: can you actually access the residuals?
@HeikoS	lambday: thats a nice idea in fact
@HeikoS	Cant you do that for a small matrix, extract the residuals and then just plot?
 lambday	HeikoS: externally, run the c++ in debug more, collect the residuals (thanks to you)
 lambday	HeikoS: how can I externally insert an image to a notebook.. it works locally, but while uploading it in the gist to the nbviewer, I don't find an option to upload any image
@HeikoS	lambday: I dont like this so much with the external picture
@HeikoS	lambday: though I like the idea about plotting convergence
 lambday	HeikoS: then I have to add something in the solvers itself to store the residuals :-/
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, in fact that is useful
@HeikoS	lambday: but it should be off by default
 lambday	HeikoS: is it :-/
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, in cases one is interested in acessing residuals
 besser82	HeikoS, wiking, sonne|work: Anyone of you interested in adding ViennaCL-support to SHOGUN?
@HeikoS	lambday: can this be done once? and then used form all solvers?
 lambday	HeikoS: alright then
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe do other things first
@HeikoS	lambday: its not too important
@HeikoS	lambday: but the external picture is not really useful if there is not code how to generate it
 lambday	HeikoS: could you please explain a bit regarding the ozone model
@HeikoS	and since convergence diagnostics are always useful, should be in there
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah I understand
@HeikoS	lambday: ok, what to explain?
 lambday	HeikoS: I didn't get what these matrices represent?
 lambday	GiCG, C0, G A
@HeikoS	besser82: maybe at some point :)
@HeikoS	besser82: would be cool to have these kind of backend
@HeikoS	besser82: though we are currently heavily using eigen3
@HeikoS	lambday: ah
@HeikoS	lambday: thats not too important, it is the model
@HeikoS	so A is a piecewise linear triangulation of a sphere (the globe)
 lambday	(with Q, we are not even using A, right?)
@HeikoS	it takes the latent gaussian field of the model (which lives on a sphere) and maps it to a plane
@HeikoS	lambday: there are two log-dets in the log likelihood
@HeikoS	once involves A^T A

@HeikoS	if eigen3 had a backend like that, that would be coo
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	and is rather the way to go
@HeikoS	ah I just see there is eigen stuff in there
 besser82	HeikoS: wouldn't be much for eigen3 --> ViennaCL.  ViennaCL has interface for eigen3  :)

 lambday	what's ViennaCL?
@HeikoS	lambday: dont worry for now :)  but here http://viennacl.sourceforge.net/viennacl-about.html
 besser82	lambday: ViennaCL is BLAS, LAPACK/ATLAS, eigen3 on OpenCL/CUDA :)
 lambday	HeikoS: just curious :D
@HeikoS	lambday: so you could add a little section before or after the tools section
@HeikoS	which states the ozone model
 lambday	HeikoS: tools?
@HeikoS	solvers etc
@HeikoS	and kind of motivates why we need the log-determinants
@HeikoS	and then runs the thing with very low max iterations
@HeikoS	to illustrate that it works on desktop computers
 lambday	HeikoS: why we need log-determinants --- is coming from the requirement of computing the log-likelihood itself, right?

@HeikoS	you can point to the Aune et al paper
@HeikoS	or even to this one
 lambday	besser82: sounds really interesting
 lambday	:D
 lambday	besser82: I have no clue regarding the last two OpenCL/.CUDA :D
 lambday	HeikoS: :-/
@HeikoS	http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.3436.pdf
@HeikoS	page 22 bottom
@HeikoS	you could reference this
 besser82	lambday: it surely is. openCL / CUDA is distributed computing using your GPU for performing.
 lambday	HeikoS: checking
 besser82	lambday: CUDA is sth. specific to nvidia-cards
@HeikoS	besser82: this stuff is only interesting if existing libraries do this in the back
@HeikoS	besser82: otherwise its way too technical to use
@HeikoS	besser82: i played with GPUs a bit a few years ago
@HeikoS	and without std libs this is pure horror ;=
 besser82	HeikoS: ViennaCL should give simple interfaces to use for sci-tech tasks :)
@HeikoS	besser82: so if we can keep our eigen3 calls as they are and just do some magic in the background, I am really up for this!
 besser82	HeikoS: http://viennacl.sourceforge.net/viennacl-examples-eigen.html
 besser82	HeikoS: nothing much to change :)
 lambday	HeikoS: I need to study :-/ what are these parameters :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: I thought giving only your paper as reference for ozone
@HeikoS	lambday: so, what I suggest, is just to state the model (as in the poster), mention the log-likelihood, and then show that one can compute the likelihood using shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: https://github.com/karlnapf/ozone-roulette/blob/master/ozone/distribution/OzonePosterior.py
@HeikoS	just take the log_likelihood method and use log_det_estimate_shogun and solve_sparse_linear_system_shogun
 lambday	HeikoS: and the outputs/images?
 lambday	oh okay
@HeikoS	and say that for illustration, you only estimate the log-det but solve the linear system with cholesky
 besser82	HeikoS: so just copying in/out eigen3-datatypes and performing tasks on them.
@HeikoS	lambday: images would be nice
@HeikoS	lambday: the plotting code is in matlab though, let me check how we can get the map
 lambday	HeikoS: no no.. I only want to put that much part that I myself understand :(
@HeikoS	lambday: ok then, just state the model, it has an easy form since it is a std model, it just looks technical
@HeikoS	so if you tell the distributions of x, y|y, tau, kappa, and then state the log-likelihood that is ok
@HeikoS	and then you can plot y if you want
@HeikoS	lambday: just if you want of course
@HeikoS	lambday: ill send you code to plot the observations of the ozone model
 lambday	HeikoS: ah thanks.. :)
@HeikoS	lambday: the idea here is that you just say: "Here is a sparse Gaussian model for which this stuff is useful"
 lambday	yes
@HeikoS	and the likelihood function in the file I sent you is just directly turning the log-likelihood math into numbers, no tricks there

 lambday	HeikoS: the log_likelihood method in the OzonePosterior?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lambday: check it, it just computes the log-likelihood on the poster
@HeikoS	lambday: I have not plotting code in python and its non-trivial to plot
@HeikoS	lambday: thinking on what to do ....
 lambday	HeikoS: let's chuck it
 lambday	HeikoS: I'll add these things later on this notebook when I'll work on more on this..
@HeikoS	lambday: okay
 lambday	HeikoS: I really liked the issues that you posted, parallel computation engine and one other
 lambday	HeikoS: I would like to work on that
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah we can work on that
 lambday	HeikoS: plus there are many many tricks that the paper suggested, I'd like to explore these too
 shogun-buildbot	build #165 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/165
@HeikoS	lambday: but I think it still would be nice to say: Here is a std GMRF model and its log likelihood. Here we load some ozone data, see reference paper, and here we can compute the log-likelihood
@HeikoS	lambday: its ultra cool even without images
@HeikoS	so I would totally suggest to add that
 lambday	HeikoS: so, computing the likelihood thing, I can use your code? :D
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah sure
@HeikoS	its GPL :)
 lambday	hehe
 lambday	alright
 lambday	yeah it would be really cool
 lambday	so, the structure would be ---intro --- log-det on apache2, walking through the components --- ozone --reference
 lambday	not just apache2, but also west0479
 lambday	with fill-in
 lambday	I really want to put apache2 fill in cause as per source that shows worst fill-in

@iglesiasg	sonney2k, lisitsyn ping ping
 lisitsyn	ja
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hello
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, how are you?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: fine
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what about you?
@iglesiasg	LMNN is giving headache :D
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what's with it?
@iglesiasg	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/11599254#L4772
@iglesiasg	integration test
@iglesiasg	the 16th decimal or so is different :D
 lisitsyn	hah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, can that be Eigen related?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no clue :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: is that ok accuracy?
 lisitsyn	I mean 16th sign is a bit too much
 lisitsyn	but who knows
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, a bit too much?
@iglesiasg	I think the difference is insignificant
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: looks too precise
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I have just run it more than 100 times here in my machine and it is always OK.
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I guess I could just deactivate de integration test
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I am not sure what to do about it
@iglesiasg	some of the parts are already tested in unit tests
@iglesiasg	it is fine in the  buildbot as well
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: please disable integration tests on travis
 sonne|osx	it is sufficient to have this on the buildbots
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx:
 lisitsyn	ok
@iglesiasg	I like that initiative!
@iglesiasg	thank you guys
 lisitsyn	I like to disable/delete
 lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: can you do the gdb thing?
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: yes
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1643
 lisitsyn	I am on it just after integration tests
 sonne|osx	this would help *a lot* to fix e.g. cyg1

 lisitsyn	oh gosh wiking you have done crazy amount of work with cmake
 besser82	lisitsyn: araound?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yes what's up?
 besser82	lisitsyn: I've seen you're adding ViennaCL to tapkee...
 lisitsyn	besser82: I've made some experiments
 besser82	lisitsyn: Any motivation to bring this up to SHOGN?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well I should update tapkee in shogun yeah
 lisitsyn	besser82: the problem is that speedup is not really worth the game
 besser82	lisitsyn: for tapkee or shogun?
 lisitsyn	besser82: the only thing I have seen is some 1.5x speedup with diffusion maps
 lisitsyn	besser82: for shogun it makes sense
 lisitsyn	but needs proper design
 besser82	lisitsyn: eigenvectors do get really fast with it :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: dense?
 besser82	lisitsyn: both sparse and dense
 lisitsyn	besser82: full eigendecomposition?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  not tried yet
 lisitsyn	besser82: I mean is it full or partial?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  should be full
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's the critical point because in tapkee full eigendecomposition is never used
 lisitsyn	say you are computing LLE embedding
 lisitsyn	you have N x N sparse matrix
 lisitsyn	but to compute 2d embedding you need *only* 3 smallest eigenvectors

 besser82	lisitsyn: so partial...
 lisitsyn	yeah so I need partial
 lisitsyn	that's why I am tied to arpack :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: but ViennaCL should support both
 lisitsyn	let me check
 lisitsyn	I don't mind to put it if it is here
 lisitsyn	I tried to make it modular
 lisitsyn	besser82: true, lanczos is here
 besser82	lisitsyn: :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: ah one more problem - I don't have any gpu ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: pocl is your freind :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: pocl is openCL on cpu only :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: well no, my cpu supports opencl natively
 lisitsyn	that's sandy bridge
 lisitsyn	but hey that's essentially the same
 lisitsyn	I mean I can't see the speedup
 besser82	lisitsyn: because of no GPU :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: GTX285 SLI nearly oupterforms recent XEON !!!
 besser82	lisitsyn: and is really affordable $
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay thanks for the tip, I'll try to put lanczos to tapkee
 besser82	lisitsyn: :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: well I am kind of mobile so I used to use notebook
 lisitsyn	I am switching cities sometimes :D
 lisitsyn	like today
 besser82	lisitsyn: me, too. But mine has GTX580 SLI :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: in notebook :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: .. and your notebook weights like 8 kg I guess ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: nope ~5 kg  :)
 lisitsyn	oh damn
 besser82	but with 17" screen :D
 besser82	and 3 HDD
 besser82	if i need ultra-mobility i use my old q45 from samsung  ---> ~1.5 kg
 lisitsyn	well you can save some money on fitness carrying tihs bag of potato
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	sure :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: anyway I just don't need gpu computing
 lisitsyn	that's the main reason
 lisitsyn	:)
 besser82	if you don't need then all is fine :)
 lisitsyn	I played with it out of curiousity but it doesn't look I need it
 besser82	but in shogun
 besser82	it would be a real option :D
 lisitsyn	I don't mind to spend some time on that if there is real demand
 besser82	combined with sth. like openShift I it would be great...

 lisitsyn	besser82: I see a few problems there
 besser82	lisitsyn: which?
 lisitsyn	1) I don't know how to design heterogeneous software
 lisitsyn	2) I don't know how to deal with limited memory here
 lisitsyn	I mean say you have kernel svm
 lisitsyn	you need to have all the features in gpu memory
 lisitsyn	otherwise you'll spend most of the time copying stuff back and forth
 besser82	won't 1.5 Gbytes be enough?
 lisitsyn	besser82: 1.5gb seem to be enough yeah

 besser82	lisitsyn: any recent gtx285+ has at least 1gig
 lisitsyn	oh I have no clue about these numbers ;)
 lisitsyn	well yeah 1gb should be ok
 besser82	lisitsyn: gtx285 is from ~ 4years ago ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: today's GTX{5,6,7,8}** are all <= 2Bytes of mem
 lisitsyn	besser82: I haven't had any non-notebook computer nearly the same time
 besser82	lisitsyn: today's GTX{5,6,7,8}** are all >= 2Bytes of mem
 lisitsyn	like once I started my studies
 lisitsyn	heh
 besser82	desktops have these specs as well
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have to get back to the fact I don't need it :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: ok, ok :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: but if I get some hardware like that I'll try it for sure
 lisitsyn	besser82: we should employ gpu to compile shogun to make it fast :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: using gpu on compiling or compiling with support for gpu-use?
 lisitsyn	besser82: jk :) it is so slow
 besser82	lisitsyn: jk?
 lisitsyn	besser82: just kidding
 besser82	lisitsyn: kk
 besser82	lisitsyn: but compiling isn't that slow takes ~7 minutes
 besser82	lisitsyn: try compiling Mahout :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: will run ~40 minutes on i7
 lisitsyn	besser82: really?
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes
 lisitsyn	besser82: but its java, how can it be that slow?
 lisitsyn	I am totally surprised
 besser82	lisitsyn: because of maven
 besser82	lisitsyn: hadoop takes ~1h
 lisitsyn	besser82: what makes it that slow with maven?
 besser82	lisitsyn: not sure...
 besser82	lisitsyn: no idea
 lisitsyn	besser82: sounds so weird!
 lisitsyn	I am really surprised because I was used to think java = rather fast compilation
 besser82	lisitsyn: not even close :D
 lisitsyn	C++ is terribly slow when it comes to expression templates like in eigen3
 besser82	lisitsyn: that's true, but java is always slow :)
 lisitsyn	well at my job we have quite good performance with java
 lisitsyn	we are heavily using message passing with akka and I can't say it is slow
 lisitsyn	well and I used to compile terribly big modules at my previous job and it was ok too
 lisitsyn	that's why I am surprised
 besser82	lisitsyn: I really don't know what the apache-people did to it, making it that slow :(
 lisitsyn	besser82: when I hear apache I think of cemetary
 lisitsyn	like they have zillions of dead projects
 besser82	lisitsyn: but Mahout is one of the recent ones :) still in beta
 besser82	lisitsyn: or RC now
 lisitsyn	yeah that's not dead
 lisitsyn	I have used http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/
 lisitsyn	but I didn't know what to think with last commit in ~2007
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: did you mean both integration and unit tests?
