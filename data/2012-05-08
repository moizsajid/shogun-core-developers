 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/508
 wiking	now it's good... no leak with xval
 CIA-113	shogun: Viktor Gal master * rc132e97 / src/shogun/machine/MulticlassMachine.cpp :
 CIA-113	shogun: Fix mem-leak in MulticlassMachine
 CIA-113	shogun: apply() had an extra SG_REF on the returned CLables - http://git.io/-iQ12g
 CIA-113	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r9d6bd98 / (35 files in 15 dirs): introduce ref counted SGMatrix - http://git.io/ivMJSQ
 wiking	mmm classifier_multiclasslinearmachine.cpp is not leaking anymore
@sonney2k	the madness continues
 PhilTillet	madness ? This is spartaaaaaa
 PhilTillet	Oh hi everybody :P
 blackburn	:D
 PhilTillet	I have found a magic paper for SVM on CUDA, which provides also GPL code !
@sonney2k	PhilTillet, hehe
@sonney2k	did you try it yet?
 PhilTillet	as soon as my robot competition is over i'll probably start from that, port that code to OpenCL and integrate it into Shogun (and also integrate the CUDA version)
 wiking	sonney2k: http://pastebin.com/qaGqMmyX
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, not yet, my laptop has some problems :p
 PhilTillet	http://nagoya.uchicago.edu/~cotter/projects/gtsvm/
 PhilTillet	but the benchmarks are encouraging :p
 PhilTillet	and it's only one year old, so very recent
@sonney2k	hmmh tiny data sets though
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah fixes welcome ... it will take another few days to fix them I guess
 PhilTillet	well, true, but bigger size should not cause any issue
@sonney2k	but probably not as long as SGVector
 wiking	"Google breached Oracle's Java copyright, US jury finds"
 wiking	yeeeeeey
 wiking	API is copyrightable.:DDDDD
@sonney2k	sparse* / stringlist shold be no problem
@sonney2k	OMFG
 wiking	welcome to hell :>
 PhilTillet	omg
 PhilTillet	:o
@sonney2k	ok bed time
 wiking	"Oracle's lawyers compared the creation of APIs to writing a piece of music, going further to say that API's are not just "ideas," but creative, copyrightable works that require significant expertise and time to develop"
 wiking	wooohooooo
 wiking	we are writing here music apparently
 wiking	\o/
 PhilTillet	X-D
 PhilTillet	gn sonney2k
 wiking	holycow these lawyers are idiots
 blackburn	I really hate oracle
 wiking	it'll be really funny now
 blackburn	everything is so cumbersome
 blackburn	and a lot of lawyers
 wiking	seeing all kinds of cases when they start to sue each other by using the same api
 blackburn	phew
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	so i just wonder
 blackburn	wiking: what is API they are so proud of?
 wiking	if i can copyright
 wiking	print (string a)
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	yeah that's crazy expertise-requiring pattern
 wiking	because as soon as i can can acquire the copyright for thaaaat!!!
 wiking	i'm gonna sue each and every motherfucker trying to print :D
 blackburn	wiking: I believe it took a few years to come up with this api
 wiking	blackburn: :>>>
 wiking	i wonder if this would be the same
 wiking	print (string a)
 wiking	print (char* a)
 wiking	:P

 blackburn	I need money too :D
 blackburn	totally different API
 wiking	ahahhahaa
 wiking	ok
 wiking	deal
 blackburn	wiking: you can take all the print API market
 blackburn	can't*
 blackburn	small companies need they own print API
 PhilTillet	I take the operator= market
 wiking	i think after a while technological companies will have to move out of the USA
 PhilTillet	:D
 wiking	i mean like this there's not much thing u can actually use
 wiking	without license
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	hmm my brain is low-power
 wiking	need store_model_features nooow :D

 sonne|work	wiking: the rationale is: when you return a newly created SGObject but don't need it internally you should *NOT* SG_REF it!
* sonne|work sigh
 sonne|work	the biggest consumer of SGMatrix is SimpleFeatures
 sonne|work	and that one doesn't internally use it yet
 sonne|work	so it needs a BIG effort to convert it to use these things
-!- cronor [~cronor@g225030209.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	wiking: btw shouldn't we rename CSimpleFeatures to CDenseFeatures
 sonne|work	?
 wiking	yep
 sonne|work	we are breaking too much anyways so we can aswell fix legacy naming bugs
 wiking	that would be more appropriate
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@190.Red-2-137-59.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: ideas for the store model features in case of kernelMC?
 sonne|work	wiking: same way as in KernelMachine
 wiking	well yeah that's the problem
 wiking	svs
 sonne|work	but you should try to avoid storing them more than once
 wiking	currently we don't store svs within the clas
 wiking	s
 sonne|work	wiking: but we should...
 sonne|work	more work but I guess pluskid can help here too
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll see about it then
 sonne|work	it will need some discussion how to do it most efficiently
 sonne|work	as in no / little code duplication
 wiking	and as i can see we can suppose that any kernelMC machine will have SVs
 wiking	just like in binary case
 sonne|work	and no memory overhead
 sonne|work	yeah but there are different schemes
 sonne|work	one vs one
 sonne|work	one vs rest
 sonne|work	etc
 wiking	yep
 sonne|work	and general ECOC
 wiking	maybe then
 sonne|work	so we need a way to store only the required SVs - but *once*
 wiking	implementing the data_lock mechanism would be faster? :)
 sonne|work	don't see how it is related
 wiking	well i want to have xval for kernelMC
 wiking	that's it
 wiking	it's either via implementing data_lock et al or doing the store_model_features
 sonne|work	hehe it is clear that we need both
 wiking	heheh in a long run yeah
 wiking	but i just want to have xval support for MC kernel machines kind of like now

-!- n4nd0 [~nando@190.Red-2-137-59.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 272 seconds]
 wiking	sonne|work: you mean by splitting the dataset by hand? :)
 sonne|work	how big is it?
 wiking	200k examples
 wiking	with 20+ labels
 sonne|work	then data lock won't help you
 sonne|work	IIRC that will precompute the kernel matrix
 sonne|work	-> boom boom
 sonne|work	but I would rather use a linear method for that...
-!- abn_ [av3ngr@nat/redhat/x-sjdrwpxzkatjgopq] has quit [Quit: That's all folks!]
 wiking	btw i was thinking to extend CrossValidationResult for MC case
 wiking	so that we'll be able to print as well not just the mean accuracy
 wiking	but lets say mean accuracy per class
 wiking	any objetions
 wiking	?
 wiking	and actually have the possibility for per class precision, recall, F1 for mc as well... that could be done today imho
 sonne|work	wiking: feel free... maybe add some flag or so to dis/enable to. not sure exactly whether this should not be sth in evaluation
 sonne|work	I mean like we have contingencytable evaluation
 wiking	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	with f1/accuracty/.. for binary classification
 sonne|work	you could do the same for mc
 wiking	yep
 wiking	that's what i thought
 wiking	follow the same idea
 wiking	for MC
 sonne|work	yeah
 wiking	ok i'm off for 2 hours for a meeting
 wiking	and i'll be doing these after that
 wiking	and help u out as well in the leaking of matrix
 wiking	and i guess i should rather write an email about store_models_feature on the mailing list
 wiking	since pluskid is not around
 wiking	i guess he is still sick or something
 sonne|work	yeah - lets hope he recovers soon
 wiking	ok email sent to the mailing list
 wiking	lets see the reactions

 cronor	Would somebody check my code (20 lines) for CombinedKernel? If I use one Kernel in MKL everything works fine, if I add the same kernel again, the results become really bad.

 blackburn	sonne|work: densefeatures
 cronor	blackburn: do I have to use CombinedFeatures, too?
 blackburn	cronor: ok looks ok..
 blackburn	I am not sure while you use custom kernels
 cronor	hm
 blackburn	cronor: but why do you attach *same* kernels?
 cronor	blackburn: just for testing. if it works with one kernel and i attach the same kernel again, the results should be exactly the same. but they are not
 cronor	so i know there is something wrong with the code and not with features
 blackburn	cronor: it seems to be a little confusing for me
 blackburn	what should be weights then?
 cronor	the weights should be 0.7 and 0.7 for 2-norm. this works, shogun gets this
 blackburn	cronor: so weight are correct?
 cronor	blackburn: yes weight's are correct. but i don't think this is relevant. the results for using 2 kernels should not be worse than for using 1 kernel
 blackburn	but apply is wrong?
 blackburn	cronor: what do you compare, accuracy?
 cronor	blackburn: relative absolute error
 cronor	the error with one kernel is 0.12, with two kernels 0.8, there must be something wrong
 blackburn	ah regression
 blackburn	mse?
 cronor	no i take abs(truth-pred)/max(abs(truth), abs(pred))
 cronor	but mse has the same problem
 blackburn	cronor: what if you manually set weights to 1.0, 0.0?
 cronor	how do you set manually?
 cronor	i can't find a function for that
 blackburn	cronor: set_subkernel_weights in kernel
 cronor	blackburn: ah were do i set that? after mkl.train()?
 blackburn	cronor: yeah you can try it before apply just to check whether with two kernels but one zero-weighted you have the same result
 cronor	blackburn: ok, i'm a little confused as to how the test kernel would get to know about the weights for example. maybe there is more wrong, can you check the added lines? http://pastebin.com/MvcseVwC
 blackburn	cronor: btw are your kernels proper normalized?
 cronor	i use the same kernel twice, so i don't need to worry about that here, right? in general i do generalize
 cronor	s/generalize/normalize
 cronor	blackburn: i have to leave for lunch, but i'll be back in 30 min. then i'll try the manuel setting of sub kernel weights

-!- cronor [~cronor@fb.ml.tu-berlin.de] has joined #shogun
 cronor	blackburn: when i set the kernel weight in K_tr, does it affect the kernel weight in K_te?
 blackburn	how do they relate?
 cronor	I do mkl.set_kernel(K_tr), mkl.train(), mkl.set_kernel(K_te), mkl.apply().get_labels(). I can imagine that the kernel weights that where learned for combined kernel K_tr do not affect the kernel weights for K_te
 blackburn	yeah makes no sense to train one kernel and set another one later
 cronor	so how could i do this? use test and train kernel in MKL?
 sonne|work	cronor: well you can check this - just get the kernel weight and compare if it is differnt
 cronor	sonne|work: yes, i'll try

 wiking	pluskid: hey how are you? any better?
 pluskid	wiking: hmm, better, maybe :)
 pluskid	wiking: reading the email
 wiking	pluskid: yeah we need you :)
 pluskid	why do we need to store the features in store_model_features?
 wiking	so take your time, get better first!
 wiking	pluskid: xval
 wiking	w/o that function we cannot do cross validation now
 wiking	on MC kernel machines
 pluskid	I mean, why not store index into the big kernel matrix?
 pluskid	we have the kernel for all data, don't we?
 wiking	honestly this is not really my 'genre', so i guess you should rather talk about this with heiko or sonne|work
 sonne|work	pluskid: let me explain
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.165.215] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 wiking	i just want xval support :)
 sonne|work	for kernel machines we have the vectors and their coefficients
 sonne|work	so that is what in the end makes up the machine
 sonne|work	so if you did a training you in the end need both for a functioning machine
 pluskid	yeah
 sonne|work	we started with having just the indices into training data
 pluskid	so why can't we do this in cross validation?
 sonne|work	but that is no good in most common cases
 sonne|work	for multiclass the picture is different
 sonne|work	it is much more efficient to just store the relevant support vectors once and indices into them
 pluskid	I see
 sonne|work	or keep the training set and the index if there are too many
 pluskid	I mean, if we forget about cross-validation for a moment
 sonne|work	however currently we have several SVMs
 sonne|work	which are the result of a multiclass training
 pluskid	for multiclass kernel machine
 sonne|work	and all of them store the features
 sonne|work	and that is not efficient
 pluskid	sonne|work: so we need to make it efficient
 pluskid	isn't it?
 sonne|work	so we need a general scheme to only store the indices and the training data as union of all SVs (or as a whole)
 sonne|work	pluskid: well it is not implemented because of this
 pluskid	so this is not (only) relevant to cross validation, am I correct?
 sonne|work	and this should work with general ecoc schemes then ...
 sonne|work	yes
 pluskid	OK, I see
 sonne|work	in x-val it is more important though because you modify training data all the time
 sonne|work	(by setting different subsets)
 pluskid	we are using a single copy of features, and subset to index into them in MC training
 sonne|work	yes
 pluskid	can we do this for support vectors?
 sonne|work	?
 pluskid	I mean only store the SV as subset into the training data, instead of making a copy
 sonne|work	pluskid: no because when the subset is changed the indices become invalid
 sonne|work	we would need support for multiple subsets (aka views) for data
 pluskid	I guess I saw something like subset_stack somewhere?
 pluskid	sonne|work: why subset changes? do you re-train the model?
 sonne|work	pluskid: yeah but that is just one subset consisting of a couple of stacked subsets
 pluskid	sonne|work: oh, I see, we need two subset, one for features, one for SVs, right?
 pluskid	currently they can't exist at the same time
 sonne|work	one for cross validation subset
 pluskid	hmm
 sonne|work	on top of it we have just some int32_t* into the subset
 pluskid	we need something like feature_views ?
 pluskid	brb
 sonne|work	pluskid: or we just store all SVs in the trained mc machine as copy
 sonne|work	and all good
 blackburn	sonne|work: as is?
 blackburn	or indices?
 sonne|work	as is
 blackburn	sonne|work: 100000 svs?
 sonne|work	plus indices for each ecoc scheme
 sonne|work	sure
 sonne|work	blackburn: that is the way we do it for binary now
 sonne|work	if data gets bigger no one will use x-val anyways
 blackburn	hmm right
 blackburn	but still can be more efficient
 sonne|work	yeah but in the end the trained model is: all SVs, + their coefficient
 sonne|work	s
 blackburn	sonne|work: do we need to unref matrix members?
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	sonne|work: in case we have m_matrix in class
 blackburn	do we need to unref it on destruction of class?
 sonne|work	no
 blackburn	ok
 sonne|work	same for sgvector
 blackburn	magic
 blackburn	sonne|work: so dense features are b0rken right now?
 blackburn	everything fails..
 sonne|work	blackburn: we need to convert simple features to use SGMatrix internally
 sonne|work	otherwise everything fails
 blackburn	I can try
 blackburn	if you didnot start yet
 blackburn	however I got almost no sleep tonight - can be powered off anytime :D
 sonne|work	I know what you mean...
 pluskid	I'll look at some of current code first, not quite familiar with our current way
 blackburn	I invented sleep study method :D read lecture notes - sleep - read lecture notes - sleep
 sonne|work	blackburn: or do some simple thing first please and remove SG_VUNREF and replace it with vec.unref()
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	I think this only appears in simple features and at some point we don't really need it :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: I should try to help as much as I can next days because it really breaks workflow
-!- emrecelikten [~Anubis@92.44.117.75] has joined #shogun

 sonne|work	hah

 sonne|work	SGStroika :)
 emrecelikten	hi all
 blackburn	sonne|work: ah btw
 blackburn	in kernels I believe we need to change compute
 blackburn	I think to reduce code it would be nice to redefine method that works in vectors context already
 pluskid	sonne|work> pluskid: or we just store all SVs in the trained mc machine as copy
 pluskid	^^^^^^ this is our current impl, right?
 pluskid	for both binary and mc
 blackburn	pluskid: yes for binary
 sonne|work	pluskid: no we don't have anything for mc
 blackburn	for mc notimplemented you know
 blackburn	for linear mc you don't need to store any model in means of vectors

 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	for kernel mc, store for each binary machine
 blackburn	uuhhhh
 sonne|work	no better store all required SVs once
 sonne|work	and in the binary submachines just the indices
 blackburn	makes sense
 blackburn	but pretty complex thing
 pluskid	might have to store an extra copy of Features
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	one would need to collect all indexes of SVs
 sonne|work	requires an extra copy
 blackburn	copy these vectors from lhs features
 blackburn	and setup indices in each machine
 gsomix	karlnapf, hey.
 karlnapf	hey gsomix
 sonne|work	you could use gsomix' CSet to obtain the features
 sonne|work	the indices
 sonne|work	and then just create the copy
 blackburn	no cset anymore? :D
 sonne|work	?
 blackburn	it is map :D
 sonne|work	nah it will come back
 pluskid	maybe need to make a whole copy, because we don't know which features are needed at first
 blackburn	to obtain features std's set is ok ;)
 gsomix	sonne|work, it will come back | ok.
 blackburn	sonne|work: to make you feel more comfortable

 sonne|work	pluskid: ?
 sonne|work	pluskid: you know after training which vectors are needed
 gsomix	karlnapf, what about trace? it works?
 sonne|work	you have the indices
 karlnapf	gsomix, trace?
 sonne|work	trace-mallocs
 pluskid	sonne|work: need to do union for all cross-valid trains
 karlnapf	ah
 sonne|work	pluskid: no
 sonne|work	per machine
 pluskid	per mc-machine?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: right? x-val stores model features per trained machine?
 sonne|work	yes
 karlnapf	gsomix, havent checked yesterday, will try now
 sonne|work	karlnapf: beware of SGMatrix transition
 karlnapf	sonne|work, yes model features per trained machine
 sonne|work	pluskid: see ^
 karlnapf	sonne|work, oh this will get messy :) There arent all memory leaks yet fixed, the SGVector transition kind of fucked up the migration parameter stuff, Ill have to get into it again :(
 sonne|work	karlnapf: would it be possible to drop the trained machine?
 karlnapf	gsomix, yes trace -mallocs works
 karlnapf	at least there are less errors
 karlnapf	but still lots of
 pluskid	ok
 blackburn	karlnapf: can you please formulate algorithm requiring store model features?
 blackburn	step by step :D
 blackburn	to clarify that
 karlnapf	yes sure, give me a second
 sonne|work	karlnapf: I mean then you could determine optimal parameters
 sonne|work	but don't have the machine afterwards
 sonne|work	but you could get it by training again
 karlnapf	ehm, you lost me ;)
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.181.73] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 sonne|work	woudl be useful if you don't have enough memory to store machines for 1000 parameter settings
 karlnapf	gsomix, seems like trace-mallocs gives the same number of errors as without it :) nice
 gsomix	karlnapf, which tests?
 karlnapf	libshogun
 karlnapf	sonne|work, blackburn could you summarize the problem once more for me?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: there is no problem
 sonne|work	at least from my side
 sonne|work	we just need store model features for mc
 karlnapf	and store_model_features basically has to make sure that the data that represents the model is stored internally, so kernel machine stores all features corresponding to SV in the LHS of the kernel
 karlnapf	ah ok
 sonne|work	and to do that efficiently we need to store all SVs once
 sonne|work	and indices for each sub machine
 karlnapf	what about the way I suggested in the mail this morning?
 sonne|work	I am just asking if one could avoid storing the machine at all
 karlnapf	yes fo course, but then x-val vanishes
 sonne|work	karlnapf: isn't your mail the same I suggested
 sonne|work	except that it doesn't use subsets?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: why?
 sonne|work	x-val could compute output score and good
 karlnapf	yes, might be
 sonne|work	so you know the best parameter setting
 karlnapf	x-val needs to use a trained model to apply
 karlnapf	which is done by subsetted features
 karlnapf	when you then switch to another subset and apply this doesnt work
 karlnapf	unless you store the data
 sonne|work	karlnapf: ahh you mean because of train/test data split?
 karlnapf	yes
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	but do you drop the machine afterwards?
 karlnapf	you can only apply on training data if store_model_features is not implemented
 sonne|work	I mean SG_UNREF ?
 karlnapf	after training?
 sonne|work	training -> evalution -> SGUNREF ?
 karlnapf	mmh, not sure, let me check
 blackburn	simple -> dense
 sonne|work	blackburn: ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: doing ;)
 sonne|work	blackburn: did you remove the VUNREF first?
 sonne|work	(and commit?)
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes I removed the only VUNREF
 sonne|work	and the macro too I hope
 karlnapf	sonne|work, the machine is stored in the X-Val class
 blackburn	yes
 karlnapf	so not, its not dropped
 karlnapf	only if you drop x-val class by hand
 sonne|work	karlnapf: so what I am saying is that we need an option
 sonne|work	to automagically drop it
 sonne|work	things might get to big otherwise
 karlnapf	I dont get this
 sonne|work	karlnapf: think of training on 10k examples with several classes 1000 times :)
 blackburn	oops I was editing shogun on different machine :D
 sonne|work	(1000 parameter combinations)
 sonne|work	so we don't want to store the 3000 SVs 1000 times
 karlnapf	but only the current SV set is stored
 sonne|work	?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: so only a single machine is kept?
 karlnapf	I am not sure if I get the problem though
 sonne|work	not one for each parameter setting
 karlnapf	ah wait
 karlnapf	so you mean you have multiclass with 1000 machines
 karlnapf	and each stores the SVs
 karlnapf	and we dont want that
 sonne|work	lets talk binary class for simplicity
* pluskid starts to understand what to be done after scanning some code of cmachine and crossvalidation
 sonne|work	yes we cannot store them all because they don't fit in memory
 pluskid	sonne|work: I think only "current" and "best" machines are stored along model selection
 karlnapf	but if we cannot store the SVs in memory, we were not able to store data in memory before right?
 sonne|work	karlnapf: is it true what pluskid says - because that is what I am asking
 CIA-113	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r3abc1ea / (2 files in 2 dirs): Removed vunref - http://git.io/sTevmQ
 sonne|work	if yes then all good
 karlnapf	are we talking about model-selection or cross-validation?
 blackburn	I am completely fucking lost with it
 sonne|work	model selection
 karlnapf	ah ok, sorry then
 sonne|work	with grid search
 karlnapf	there is only one machine
 karlnapf	parameters are applied to machine
 sonne|work	ok then all good
 karlnapf	evaluation
 karlnapf	results are stored
 sonne|work	\o/
 karlnapf	next parameter combination
 karlnapf	see CGridSearchModelSelection::select_model
 karlnapf	btw store_model_features is related to x-val
 karlnapf	not to model selection
 sonne|work	pluskid: ok but then I would say we collect all indices, store the needed vectors as copy in memory and in submachines the adjusted indices
 sonne|work	and then all good
 karlnapf	sonne|work, gsomix, yes, I think thats the best way :)
 pluskid	sonne|work: ok, I'll do this now
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	we have an agreement? :)
 pluskid	wiking: as heiko's solution in the mailing list
 sonne|work	looks like :)
 wiking	yeeeey
 wiking	pluskid: r u implementing it now?
 sonne|work	pluskid: but w/o subsets right?
 pluskid	wiking: yes
 blackburn	the most painful thing to come in a hour!
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	I mean we have individual kernel machines anyways
 wiking	pluskid: awesome!!!
 pluskid	sonne|work: no subset, an extra copy of features
 sonne|work	so we can use their set_support_vecvtor stuff
 blackburn	prepare to change all your C++ shogun scripts :D
 sonne|work	pluskid: err but only in MulticlassKErnelMachien
 wiking	:>>
 pluskid	sonne|work: yes, he will then adjust index for sub-machines
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	blackburn: DenseFeatures are coming?
 blackburn	sonne|work: can I remove align_char_feautreS?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	pluskid: i've already prepared a libshogun example for MC kernel machine xval
 sonne|work	blackburn: is this uses anywaher
 wiking	so i'm waiting for your commit :)
 sonne|work	wiking: is the latent svm ready?
 sonne|work	:P
 blackburn	sonne|work: no it is uflly ommcented
 wiking	sonne|work: oh yeah !
 wiking	sonne|work: it works :>
 wiking	sonne|work: but only for this one and only example :)))
 wiking	and i need to reflect on your email about PSI
 sonne|work	like the xval for mc here
 wiking	since i have a request there to do
 pluskid	wiking: haha, cool!
 blackburn	sonne|work: so ok to remove?
 blackburn	simple preprocessor goes to dense too
 sonne|work	yes
 blackburn	blood
 wiking	sonne|work: now it's time for some extra evaluation statistics for MC

 sonne|work	no but actually that would be when I start to like std:: crap
 blackburn	sonne|work: today could be a great day to defeat and start to like std ;)

 wiking	mmm shit i cannot set a topic ;P
 wiking	sonne|work: can u just append to the topic: | some of us hates std namespace here so don't even try ;)
 blackburn	any sed expert here?
 wiking	blackburn: what do u need?
 blackburn	qdrgsm@qdrgsm-laptop:~/Shogun/shogun/src$ find shogun/converter | sed 's/<shogun/features/SimpleFeatures.h>/<shogun/features/DenseFeatures.h>/g'
 blackburn	sed: -e expression #1, char 20: unknown option to `s'
 blackburn	wiking: ^ what is wrong?
 wiking	i would say
 wiking	u need to escape <  and >
 wiking	and /
 wiking	r | sed 's/\<shogun\/features\/SimpleFeatures.h\>/\<shogun\/features\/DenseFeatures.h\>/g'
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	wiking: hmm how to replace in each file?
 wiking	well first of all use -i
 sonne|work	blackburn: find ./ -type f -exec sed -i ... {} \;
 wiking	so that u do inplace replacement
 blackburn	o!
 wiking	and yeah that should be fine what sonne|work says
 blackburn	what does he say?
 wiking	that do exec with find
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I did not mention it was sonne|work
 blackburn	errr
 blackburn	noticed
 blackburn	ok my brain is damaged
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	but u could do first a grep
 blackburn	yeah I did
 wiking	so that run the sed command only on the necessary files ;)
 blackburn	sonne|work: thanks
 wiking	but that makes it a little more complicated so just go with applying that on every file
 wiking	blackburn: but why don't u simply do sed -i -e 's/SimpleFeatures/DenseFeatures/g' ?
 blackburn	yes I did it
 blackburn	wanted to start with includes for some reason :D
 wiking	well this way u do the replacement everywhere not only with includes... ;P
 blackburn	yes

 pluskid	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/509
 pluskid	I hate SG_UNREF as much as sonne|work hate stl
 wiking	hahahahah
 pluskid	compiled but not tested
 wiking	pluskid: checking
 wiking	ahhahahah
 wiking	pluskid: went with std::set
 wiking	:D
 pluskid	didn't find CSet
 wiking	heheh it has become CMap ;P
 wiking	pluskid: commented
 pluskid	wiking: got it
 wiking	and added about includes as well
 wiking	i don't see u using std::vector anywhere
 wiking	but yeah i see u using map
 pluskid	wiking: was using vector, but later find copy_subset requires a SGVector, so replaced
 pluskid	I'll fix the include
 wiking	okey
 wiking	no worries i'm just saying
 wiking	sonne|work: i think this goes against the policy about SG_REF that u were mentioning in the morning: inline CFeatures* get_rhs() { SG_REF(rhs); return rhs; }
 wiking	or not...
 wiking	:D
 wiking	sorry
 wiking	sonne|work: btw: what has been the outcome of the conversation with vojtech about libqp?
 wiking	pluskid: anyhow i'll download the patch and test it here locally
 pluskid	wiking: tell me sth about SG_REF policy, I'm always confusing at this. Each time I have to open the source of the function I'm calling to see whether it did SG_REF or not, to determine whether I have to do SG_UNREF or not
 wiking	how can i download this commit as a raw file?
 pluskid	wiking: maybe you can create a local branch and merge this
 pluskid	this might be easier
 pluskid	git remote add ...; git pull ...
 wiking	pluskid: can u do this for me
 wiking	git format-patch -3
 pluskid	ok
 wiking	and send the three 000* files to me
 wiking	wiking@maeth.com
 pluskid	send you an email?
 wiking	thnx a lot

 wiking	got it i'll do the tests now

 blackburn	gsomix: bloody task?
 pluskid	wiking: when I call kernel->init(lhs, rhs), lhs and rhs are SG_REF-ed, so I don't have to SG_REF them manually right?
 blackburn	pluskid: right
 wiking	pluskid: imho yes you shouldn't
 gsomix	blackburn, not now, but you may talk about it.
 sonne|work	pluskid: yes
 blackburn	when?
 pluskid	wiking: I think I fixed this
 wiking	ok
 wiking	send me the patch
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	pluskid: only ever call SG_REF when you later want to use the object
 pluskid	though it is still crashing, but everything is crashing now ...
 pluskid	crashing somewhere else
 sonne|work	blackburn: done with DenseMatrix?
 sonne|work	blackburn: please commit...
 blackburn	sonne|work: almost..
 pluskid	sonne|work: I see
 sonne|work	pluskid: we are in SGMatrix transition... in case you use latest git everything crashes
 pluskid	sonne|work: yes, I'm using latest git
 pluskid	so survived SGVector hell and enters SGMatrix hell? Haha
 sonne|work	pluskid: then don't use simplefeatures ...
 wiking	pluskid: oh i see ok i'll just apply these changes manually :)
 sonne|work	pluskid: and then the remaining SGString/StringList/SparseVector/SparseMatrix
 pluskid	wiking: I can send you patch, a minute
 wiking	that's alright i see it in the pull request :)
 pluskid	wiking: ah, OK
 pluskid	sonne|work: and then SGObject :D :D :D
 pluskid	wiking: if I do SG_REF(sv_features) manually, a crash can be avoided, but yet another crash will occur
 pluskid	so I guess it is related to SGMatrix
 blackburn	sonne|work: almost done
 blackburn	it seems to be compileable at least
 blackburn	gsomix: pluskid: sonne|work: wiking: recall we planned doc weeks?
 pluskid	blackburn: yeah

 wiking	on
 blackburn	wiking: config.h
 blackburn	lib/config.h
 wiking	thnx
 wiking	letseewhatcouldbe
 wiking	sonne|work: so what's the idea with the referenced object, should i call SG_UNREF on it or we assume that it automagical?
 wiking	since now i have a double free on an SGMatrix...
 blackburn	wiking: what do you mean?
 wiking	so the thing is that i have malloc: *** error for object 0x10207c800: pointer being freed was not allocated
 wiking	so for sure i have a double free
 wiking	and it's with an SGMatrix
 blackburn	wiking: do you use simplefeatures?
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	it will fail
 blackburn	unconditional
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	let me try to fix it
 wiking	so the thing here is
 blackburn	wiking: dense features should use sgmatrix internally
 blackburn	so after get feature matrix is called
 wiking	so if i comment out
 wiking	the SG_UNREF for the simple features
 wiking	then the whole thing runs ok
 wiking	so this is why i think that the unreferencing/deleting is done automagically via the destructor
 wiking	so i don't need to explicitly call sg_unref on the features
 blackburn	wiking: no it is related to matrix
 wiking	so i'm creating the simplefeautres like this: CSimpleFeatures< float64_t >* features = new CSimpleFeatures< float64_t >(mat.matrix, num_feats, num_vectors);
 wiking	and the mat is an SGMatrix that has been allocated in the same function call before
 wiking	so that's why i think i should not call an SG_UNREF (features)
 blackburn	wiking: you should after this issue is fixed
 wiking	i should??/
 wiking	lol
 wiking	ok
 wiking	let me grab the last commits
 blackburn	wiking: no it is not fixed yet
 wiking	ok anyhow i want to see what's happening
 blackburn	wiking: the problem is that after gotten feature matrix
 blackburn	is destroyed
 blackburn	it destroys matrix in features
 blackburn	and features destroy it once again

 wiking	the rents must be higher than in the downtown
 blackburn	that would be crazy difficult to swim 2km for me :D
 wiking	i mean the last time i was in berlin (2010) the rent was ridicolous
 sonney2k_	blackburn, you know I am doing all kinds of long distance swimming
 sonney2k_	so not for me
 sonney2k_	I think I am developing into a whale
 wiking	i mean compared to other cities in EU or in germany...
 blackburn	I heard something about it once :)
 sonney2k_	slow once on land
 blackburn	wiking: what is life costs in belgium then? ;)
 wiking	a lot
 wiking	it's really insane here
 blackburn	wiking: is phd well paid?
 wiking	the shittiest studio in a smaller town (not brussels) is around 500 euros/month
 wiking	+ utilities
 wiking	blackburn: not really...
 blackburn	wiking: small one room flat in moscow costs ~1000$ per month :D
 wiking	but i wonder where it is well paid :)
 wiking	blackburn: hahahah yeah that's moscow...
 wiking	it's fucking insane there
 blackburn	here it is 300-400$
 wiking	i've heard that it's getting more expensive than tokyo
 blackburn	wiking: I am happy to live here almost for free :D 40$ per month
 puffin444	That much in Moscow?
 blackburn	puffin444: yes, avg salary is about 2-2.5K$
 blackburn	and rent can take 50% of it :D
 puffin444	How does that economics of that work if rent is .5 of salary?
 wiking	blackburn: ahahahaha 40$ :)
 blackburn	puffin444: no idea I never lived there and do not want to :D
 wiking	blackburn: but for example back in serbia i know people renting a 300 sqrmeter house for 80 euros
 puffin444	It seems that enough people want to though to drive up the rent.
 blackburn	wiking: yeah it just depends on local insanity
 sonney2k_	rent in berlin used to be cheap - I used to live in a 85sqm flat for 450 EUR
 blackburn	I have 12 sqm room here :D :D
 sonney2k_	but last year prizes went up quite a bit
 sonney2k_	they basically doubled
 wiking	sonney2k_: heheh that's insane. i knew people paying the double price for the same size in wien
 wiking	and that was about 6 years ago
 wiking	and wien is a shittier place than berlin in my opinion
 sonney2k_	I guess someone should continue sgmatrix bugfixing
 puffin444	Are people just coming in droves to live in these cities? I wonder whats driving up the rent.

 wiking	ok i don't get this
 wiking	WTF is the concept here please somebody enlighten me
 sonney2k_	wiking, ???
 wiking	well
 wiking	i use an SGMatrix for a densefeature
 wiking	if i SG_UNREF the densefeatures
 sonney2k_	yes
 wiking	then i get a double free error
 wiking	if i don't SG_UNREF
 wiking	then valgrind says that there's a leak
 wiking	with DenseFeatures
 sonney2k_	you should unref
 wiking	ok unref kills it
 wiking	error for object 0x7ffe9c07c800: pointer being freed was not allocated
 wiking	and it's because if i call SG_UNREF on the features
 wiking	then it'll free the sgmatrix
 sonney2k_	blackburn1, you missed a couple of SimpleFeatures
 wiking	but then on the end when the function ends the SGMatrix's
 wiking	dstor is being called
 wiking	and that tries to free as well
 blackburn1	sonney2k_: hmm where?
 sonney2k_	blackburn1, in libshogun examples ... fixing
 sonney2k_	wiking, sounds impossible
 blackburn1	how can that be.. I replaced Simple->Dense
 sonney2k_	wiking, check with valgrind

 wiking	ok so in DenseFeatures.cpp:275 ::set_feature_matrix, shouldn't there be a SG_REF(matrix) somewhere within that function?
 sonney2k_	wiking, no why?
 wiking	sonney2k_: well then it'll happen what i'm having now
 wiking	you'll have a double free
 sonney2k_	the copy constructor/assignment operator take care of that..
 wiking	i mean if u pass a matrix to a feature that will use the matrix
 wiking	imho if we follow what ref counting means
 blackburn	ref is +1 on copy
 blackburn	so set feature matrix increases ref count
 wiking	then we should increment the reference counter on the matrix
 wiking	well yeah let's say it should take care of it
 wiking	it does not
 sonney2k_	wiking SGMatrix a,b
 sonney2k_	a=b
 sonney2k_	will destroy a
 sonney2k_	and inc refcoutn of b
 sonney2k_	same with sgvector
 wiking	moreover if i use new CDenseFeatures< float64_t >(mat);
 wiking	mat is an SGMatrix
 wiking	the whole thing crashes
 sonney2k_	trace it down!
 wiking	trying
 blackburn	fixing converters
 sonney2k_	wiking, please paste your minimal example
 wiking	i'm tracing
 wiking	so now i've ended up currently
 wiking	that the matrix's ref counter is 1
 wiking	before it's dtor is being called
 wiking	and that should be the ideal case
 sonney2k_	except if someone else still has a ptr to the object and wants to destroy it
 wiking	well not anymore...
 wiking	since the dtor is being called because the function returns

 blackburn	sonney2k_: I reuse matrices => double frees

 sonney2k_	wiking, calling matrix.unref()
 sonney2k_	will set the matrix ptr and everything to NULL
 blackburn	my ccache cache is not filling up
 blackburn	sonney2k_: how did you config it?
 sonney2k_	so calling unref() again is not a problem
 sonney2k_	blackburn, we have to move code back to .cpp (in sgvectr/matrix ...)
 blackburn	sonney2k_: why?
 sonney2k_	wiking, except if the refcount ptr is not set to NULL
 sonney2k_	then unref could be done twice

 sonney2k_	wiking, seems like I didn't set m_refcount to NULL
 sonney2k_	so an x.unref() followed by another x.unref() will decr. the counter twice
 sonney2k_	which doesn't make sense
 sonney2k_	x should have no content/refcount after calling x.unref()
 sonney2k_	other y=x ' should
 sonney2k_	I guess we should make the ref function private to indicate that it is not necessary to use it
 sonney2k_	from the outside
 sonney2k_	nice
