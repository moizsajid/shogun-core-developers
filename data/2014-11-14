 USC	hi all
 USC	anybody online?
 USC	hey wiking ? are you there?
 USC	I returned back to shogun :)
@lisitsyn	welcome back :D
 USC	thx
 USC	after all linux advantures, I now started to learn Python
 USC	on windows ofcourse
 USC	and when I go to shogun-3.2.0\src\interfaces\python_modular, I see and not surprized that there is no Python files there,
 USC	python is really fast when working with large data files
 USC	so please tell me what should I do to use MKL feature of Shogun on windows + python environment
 USC	from tools.load import LoadMatrix from sg import sg from numpy import *
 USC	where is and what is tools.load? LoadMatrix
 USC	>>> from tools.load import LoadMatrix Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ImportError: No module named tools.load >>> from sg import sg Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> ImportError: No module named sg >>> from numpy import * >>>
 USC	No module named tools.load
 USC	so how do I make shogun work on python?
 USC	lisitsyn: ? will you help?
@lisitsyn	ehmm
@lisitsyn	where do you call python
@lisitsyn	?
@lisitsyn	I mean you try to import tools.load
 USC	spyder
@lisitsyn	this means that you'd have to have a folder tools
@lisitsyn	somewhere in your PYTHONPATH
 USC	I run Python on WinPython-32bit-2.7.6.3
@lisitsyn	then you won't be able to import shogun
@lisitsyn	that's why you were suggested to use linux
 USC	why I won't be able to import shogun?
 USC	is it impossible?
 USC	I have Cygwin64 Terminal on windows
 USC	will this help?
 USC	I already have python on Ubuntu
 USC	this is great
@lisitsyn	USC: if you run python under cygwin/ubuntu that's ok
 USC	I run python on cygwin, and tried the example code, it didn't work
 USC	$ python cygwin warning:   MS-DOS style path detected: \Python34\LIBSVM   Preferred POSIX equivalent is: /cygdrive/c/Python34/LIBSVM   CYGWIN environment variable option "nodosfilewarning" turns off this warning.   Consult the user's guide for more details about POSIX paths:     http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using.html#using-pathnames Python 2.7.8 (default, Jul 25 2014, 14:04:36) [GCC 4.8.3] on cygwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits

 USC	this is on cygwin python
 USC	lisitsyn: ?
@lisitsyn	tools.load is not a part of shogun
@lisitsyn	it is a helper module to load data
@lisitsyn	it is located in examples folder
 USC	ok
 USC	what do I need to do to import all shogun capabilities into python on cygwin
 USC	what about from modshogun import RealFeatures, RegressionLabels, GaussianKernel, Math
 USC	it says there is no modshogun
 USC	...

@lisitsyn	just try to run some example
@lisitsyn	and you will se
@lisitsyn	see*

 USC	lisit
 USC	lisitsyn: I tried many examples
 USC	and posted the error messages here
@lisitsyn	ehmm
@lisitsyn	did they work?
@lisitsyn	say you go to the examples/undocumented/python_modular
@lisitsyn	and do python *some file*
@lisitsyn	what happens?
@HeikoS	USC: yes happy to help
@HeikoS	USC: try this
@HeikoS	USC: python -c "import modshogun"
@HeikoS	if this works, then any of the examples in python_modular will work
 USC	HeikoS: >>> python -c "import modshogun"   File "<stdin>", line 1     python -c "import modshogun"                                ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax >>>
 USC	it didn't work
@HeikoS	what is this file <stdin> doing there?
@HeikoS	python -c "import modshogun"
@HeikoS	is all you type into your terminal
@HeikoS	which starts python and runs the command "import modshogun"
 USC	it is the result of the command
@HeikoS	then exits
@HeikoS	within python or your terminal?
 USC	terminal
 USC	sorry python
@HeikoS	in python, just do the import modshogun
 USC	ok I did it, I will paste the result
 USC	,,
 USC	>>> import modshogun
@HeikoS	sure
 USC	Traceback (most recent call last):
 USC	File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
 USC	ImportError: No module named modshogun
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	so python does not know about the file
@HeikoS	how did you install shogun?
 USC	I can't remember the codes, but I did it on the terminal
@HeikoS	i.e. where is your modshogun.py located
 USC	it took long
@HeikoS	check the build folder
@HeikoS	its usually
@HeikoS	build/src/interfaces/python_modular/
@HeikoS	whereever your build folder is
@HeikoS	is the file in there?
 USC	no it's not in there, after compiling it created a new folder  shogun-install, and there a 3 subfolders in it, include, lib and share
 USC	under shogun/build/src/ there is just one folder named shogun
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	this means you did not compile the python modular bindings
@HeikoS	you need to tell cmake to enable them, see the installation readme
@HeikoS	there are examples in there
@HeikoS	something like -DPythonModular=On or similar
@HeikoS	or quickstart readme also should contain this
 USC	ok I will try it
@HeikoS	basically, you have to run cmake again, and then run make and make install again
 USC	on the terminal, I will go to shogun\src\interfaces\python_modular directory and run these commands there, right?
@HeikoS	nono
@HeikoS	go to your build directory
@HeikoS	run cmake with the appropriate flags
@HeikoS	(will only be the python modular one for you)
@HeikoS	as said, see installation readme
@HeikoS	and then run make again
@HeikoS	and make install
 USC	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/installation.html
 USC	here?
@HeikoS	that is old
@HeikoS	which version of shogun do you have?
@HeikoS	there are two readmes in the source directory
@HeikoS	but you can also see them here
 USC	3.2.0
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
@HeikoS	USC: works?
@HeikoS	USC btw
@HeikoS	we have a binary ppa
 USC	I did all of these before, but I will delete old shogun I compiled, and download new shogun toolbox
@HeikoS	you can install from there if you have ubuntu 14.04
 USC	and will do all again
 USC	I have ubuntu 14.04
@HeikoS	maybe try this first then
@HeikoS	https://launchpad.net/~shogun-daily/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
@HeikoS	ah not sure whether python is in there
@HeikoS	may compile from source
@HeikoS	let me know how things go
 USC	ok thank you very much
 USC	HeikoS:
 USC	I couldn't figure out how to download ppa
 USC	so I started the whole process again
 USC	here in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
 USC	mkdir build
 USC	cd build
 USC	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 USC	that's why it created shogun-install directory
 USC	is this correct to create python files?
 USC	this was what I did last time
 USC	HeikoS:
 USC	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 USC	I will do this again cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" ..
 USC	Result is:

 wiking	but i reckon you should just read better the manuals
 wiking	yeah i know  i closed that bug
 USC	I do exactly what your manuals say
 USC	when?
 wiking	because that issue does not make any sense
 wiking	just now
 USC	why doesn't it make any sense? on your tutorial, you suggest to use the codes, when I type the codes, it is the result
 wiking	USC: maybe you should just not use shogun
 wiking	it's just not for you i think
 USC	I will use it
 USC	it is simply written on https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART

 USC	if you look at the errors there, you will see what is wrong
 USC	then tell me what to do
 wiking	USC:  iguess you too see it
 USC	I really would like to see it
 USC	but I can't
 USC	honestly
 USC	come on
 USC	tell me what to do
 wiking	USC: look there are like 1000 cases that shogun was compiled w/o any problems on ubuntu trusty
 wiking	so honestly i really dont know what's happening
 wiking	maybe u miss a package
 wiking	try installing it from the ppa
 wiking	that's 10000x easier
 USC	is there a list of packages should be installed on the machine?
 wiking	than compiling your own
 wiking	USC: yes it is writting in the manual
 USC	where?

@HeikoS	wiking: depedns on some other things
@wiking	okie
@HeikoS	wiking: subset of things: release, foundation, binary package & cloud
@HeikoS	wiking: but yes good point to push
@HeikoS	wiking: but I suggest to focus getting the release out soon
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	i'm still on the c# fix
@HeikoS	wiking: me on the blog post
@HeikoS	and some doc fixes
@HeikoS	for doxygen
@wiking	as i want to get the osx modular bot to work
@HeikoS	wiking: yes would be good
@wiking	btw we should work on docstring
@HeikoS	wiking: ellaborate pls
@wiking	or wtf is the name of the python documentation format
@wiking	well you know doxygen -> python doc format
@wiking	e.g. output http://packman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
@HeikoS	you suggest to replace doxygen by that?
@wiking	nono
@wiking	doxygen is a good thing
@wiking	i dont know when
@wiking	but swig will have a way to autogenerate
@wiking	docstring from doxygen
@HeikoS	ah i see
@wiking	currently we have some home made hack
@HeikoS	to get a python doc size
@HeikoS	site
@HeikoS	for explicit python methods
@HeikoS	?
@wiking	but that's never ever published anywhere
@HeikoS	wiking: yep I agree that would be good
@wiking	how's the new website coming aong?
@HeikoS	wiking: btw do you still need access on my machine?
@HeikoS	wiking: kevin is on it
@HeikoS	wiking: but still many things missing
@wiking	HeikoS: haven't managed to finish up the matlab thingy
@wiking	but i dont know when i will be able
@HeikoS	wiking: lets postpone to after release?
@wiking	i mean it seem pretty fucking straightforward
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	we would need to work on the typemaps
@wiking	and i dont think we should do this for this release
@wiking	we can do a quickrelease around jan
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	agreed
@HeikoS	we really should release soon and then to a tidy up release before gsoc
@wiking	i need to fix as well the nightly stuff
@HeikoS	yeah would be good
@HeikoS	wiking: how much work to get a binary ppa upload every night?
@wiking	it's some script hacking though
@wiking	HeikoS: pffff
@HeikoS	wiking: and nightly cloud update?
@HeikoS	wiking: both important when I talk to people
@wiking	yeah i know
@wiking	well once there's ppa
@HeikoS	wiking: does this mean a lot?
@wiking	there's docker
@HeikoS	:D
@HeikoS	ok cool
@wiking	ppa is the most importnat
@HeikoS	and pffff=ridiculus? ;)
@wiking	the thing is that i can generate easy the libshogun stuff
@wiking	as soeren did there the most part
@wiking	but
@wiking	python-shogun
@wiking	and we need that
@HeikoS	yes at least
@wiking	for the docker image right?
@wiking	since we want ipython notebooks
@HeikoS	yes thats also a good start point for distributing binaries
@HeikoS	libshogun+python_modular
@wiking	yeah and that's the tricky part
@HeikoS	wiking: that would be good to have before release, but not too bad if thats not in
@wiking	python-modular
@wiking	package
@HeikoS	wiking: so maybe also postpone to after release (soon after release?)

 huska	ok
@wiking	nono
@wiking	send it in
 huska	I'll probably split it into two, there is one mapping that is a bit dodgy
 huska	R has no unsigned integer type, so I try to squeeze the results into a double and fail if the unsigned int is too big... not sure if there's anything better that can be done

@wiking	that's a bit hacky
 huska	yes it's the dirtiest thing I've ever written
 huska	I can leave that out, but I needed it for my work
 huska	I don't have much hope that R will ever have unsigned longs though, they don't have any unsigned types at all
