 Saurabh7	saisiddhant, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Getting-involved
 Saurabh7	OXPHOS, Hi !
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7, Hey! Just saw your comments. Thanks!
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7: Seems I have more basic problem to tackle first..but I don't have a clue why. Missing stdint.h?
 Saurabh7	OXPHOS, uhm whats that :)
 Saurabh7	in what context is that
 Saurabh7	gotta run brb 15 min
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7: I had error "Exception: Failed to obtain include path for int32_t or Cint32_t or int32_t or Cint32_t" when compiling [all] meta examples but they were not there the first time.
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7: Don't know whether it is also caused by the ctags issue lisitsyn metioned.
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7: I'll be around. Thanks.

 Saurabh7	OXPHOS, not sure i havent worked with cookbook yet, but looks like its possibly due to the ctags thing
 OXPHOS	Saurabh7: I'll take that! Thx. It is quite fun working on cookbook/meta-language
 Saurabh7	yup its been a pretty good addition
