 heiko	sonney2k, are you there?
-!- in3xes__ [~in3xes@180.149.49.227] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 heiko	i have a suggestion for the lists in shogun
 heiko	currently there is this CList class
 heiko	which is for CSGObjects
 heiko	but i need a list for different types
 heiko	so my suggestion:
 heiko	build a base class CList, which just implements a list for any type without any SG_REF stuff
 heiko	then inherit from this class CObjectList, which does the same as the current CList (SG_REF stuff and only SGObjects)
 heiko	and then: (what I actually need): inherit from this class to have a sorted list for any type
 heiko	even, there could be an abstract class serving as interface collection for lists, like this is done in java
 heiko	the alternatic to this (quite a lot of work) is to implement CSortedList directly without touching everything else. most methods (inserting etc) have to be overwritten anyways so only the get methods are redundant to the current CList
 heiko	then on top of the CSortedList, I want to implement the map
 heiko	or even simpler:
 heiko	directly implement the map
 heiko	use a DynArray internally and sort on the fly
 heiko	and put structs with old and new name in this DynArray
 heiko	will go for lunch now, tell me what you think :)
-!- in3xes_ is now known as in3xes
@sonney2k	heiko, yes use a dynarray - that is waht I would have suggested anyways :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm still worried if ACML things in lapack.cpp are not working, how can we test it
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know - someone contributed these - isn't he mentioned in the credits?
 blackburn	ain't you?
 blackburn	I did it too in new wrappers
 blackburn	I just don't sure it will be working in the right way

 blackburn	yup!
 blackburn	laplacian eigenmaps is almost ready

@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean all you did plan for GSoC?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah seems so
@sonney2k	blackburn, code wise you mean right? or did you do documentation / examples too?
 blackburn	sonney2k: english/russian doc to go
@sonney2k	not a lot - great. I hope you have some time to do java then
@sonney2k	btw
@sonney2k	I got an answer on the swig mailinglist
 blackburn	bout?
@sonney2k	I now know how to derive swig wrapped classes from Serializable
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, and look how simple this is
@sonney2k	%typemap(javainterfaces)       SWIGTYPE "Serializable"
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	blackburn, to you recall what functions need to be implemented in java for this to implement the Serializable interface?
 blackburn	writeObject and readObject IIRC
 blackburn	well Serializable is not a interface with methods
 blackburn	but we need to implement write and read
@sonney2k	private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream out)
@sonney2k	     throws IOException
@sonney2k	 private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream in)
@sonney2k	     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	it is used automagically then we are e.g. using ObjectOutputStream
 blackburn	SHOGUN is mainly developed by
 blackburn	\li Soeren Sonnenburg <Soeren.Sonnenburg@tuebingen.mpg.de>
 blackburn	\li Gunnar Raetsch <Gunnar.Raetsch@tuebingen.mpg.de>
 blackburn	\li Sebastian Henschel <shogun@kodeaffe.de>
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^ not actual, right?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	but these 3 did a lot of work :)
@bettyboo	:>
@sonney2k	(at some point at least)
 blackburn	hmhmh
 blackburn	I have absolutely no idea about what to do in doc..
@sonney2k	blackburn, just translate it - or?
 blackburn	english one is pretty outdated
@sonney2k	not that much I would say
@sonney2k	so if you find outdated stuff fix it please
@sonney2k	you really are best suited for this because you are carefully reading the doc
 blackburn	yes I'm trying to get comprehension what to fix
