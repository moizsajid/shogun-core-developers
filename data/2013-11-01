@wiking	sonne|osx: ok i'll have to work quite some time on being able to make a distributed webapp for cloud... ;P
@wiking	sonne|osx: as we'll need to be able to share the user instances<->container id mapping between the instances that can run docker
 sonne|osx	wiking: well it would be cool. I guess we can get some sponsorship by our friends at google / amazon/ microsoft
 sonne|osx	wiking: so some system that works transparently across those would be nice
@wiking	sonne|osx: well what we need basically is a webapp that serves the docker instances across various nodes
@wiking	taking in account the load on a given nodee
@wiking	*node
@wiking	that i guess could be a simple weighted round robin :P
 sonne|osx	wiking: btw with HeikoS we discussed about the distributed stuff we wanted to do and it might be a GSoC project to do e.g. modelselection using azure/ec2/gcloud
@wiking	sonne|osx: well instances are now easy to setup
 sonne|osx	wiking: only problem I see is how to get user data back and forth
@wiking	if one has docker
@wiking	sonne|osx: well hdfs
 sonne|osx	wiking: so it writes to fatbot's hd?
@wiking	mmm wait
 sonne|osx	wiking: errm and we should really do some backup of fatbot now
@wiking	sonne|osx: i thought you are speaking about distributed shogun stuff
@wiking	sonne|osx: because there the easiest is that u do a hdfs kind of stuff and there the nodes are r/w to hdfs
 sonne|osx	wiking: no your cloud stuff but indeed hdfs would also fix things but no idea how this can work when your connection is rather limited (firewall?)
@wiking	sonne|osx: but with cloud it's not that big a deal
@wiking	sonne|osx: each node has it's own docker manager
@wiking	and the master node is just talking with these managers
 sonne|osx	wiking: I am thinking about scenarios where you have a cluster and an entrance node
 sonne|osx	and only the entrance node has direct network access
@wiking	and the master node is taking care between the userid<->docker instance id mapping
 sonne|osx	everything else goes via the cluster
@wiking	sonne|osx: this is for distributed shogun? or cloud now? :)
 sonne|osx	wiking: but how is stuff written then?
 sonne|osx	haha
 sonne|osx	that was for distributed shogun but what I just said about your stuff
@wiking	sonne|osx: what do you mean how is it written?
 sonne|osx	sry gtg
 sonne|osx	brb

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Fix overflow of 32-bit signed integers when multiplying two 32-bit integers: cast to 64-bit integers first, otherwise matrices with number of elements > 2^31 (e.g. a 48,000x48,000 custom kernel matrix) will not work.

 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: increadible
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: could you please make the video page the default for the workshop?
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: if I click here http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, mm I think we talked already about that. You mean to click on Workshop 2013 and that videos appear directly
 sonne|osx	it doesn't select videos
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: yes
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: you did it in a way that when you click on events that the workshop & videos are activated
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, ok but then, when is the stuff that is currently shown in in that page shown?
 sonne|osx	but not the rest
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: ahh true
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, one possibility is to show one video in the current small article called video recordings
@iglesiasg	just so that the thumbnail is directly seen when clicking on Workshop 2013
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: yeah these certainly need *PICTURES*
 sonne|osx	boring to watch
 sonne|osx	wiking: about the cloud thing - is all of that in the shogun-cloud repo?
 sonne|osx	wiking: I mean templates too?
