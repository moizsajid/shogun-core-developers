-!- blackburn [~blackburn@185.6.239.191] has joined #shogun
 heiko	blackburn: I have done all my stuff for release
 heiko	blackburn: there are some bugs open, but I think it would more sense if other people fixed then since they are more into the framework at that point
 heiko	blackburn: I have details about the problems in the issues
 nando	heiko: I will have a look to the issues and see if there is something for me there
-!- nando [~nando@n145-p185.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 blackburn	heiko: okay I see
 heiko	nadn0, cool, I think its just a point of how much time one is going to spend on these bugs, and someone who has written the code will probably be faster in doing this
 heiko	blackburn: what do you think of adding this automatic example description? we could have some meta tags in the files for this
 blackburn	heiko: reading your mail
 blackburn	heiko: well we have something (recall we have documentation in examples)
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :master * a499fcd / src/shogun/statistics/LinearTimeMMD.h: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/a499fcd75ccbb3b0939760a5800bc1524b28d1b8
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: removed warnings by adding documentation
 blackburn	heiko: like that http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/python_modular_examples.html#python_modular_kernel_examples
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :master * 6bc71bb / src/shogun/statistics/LinearTimeMMD.h: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/6bc71bb61422fa361079a55986d047a7789762c7
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #909 from karlnapf/master
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: more warnings removed
 heiko	blackburn:  I know, but this just pastes the code into the website
 blackburn	heiko: doc + code
 heiko	where is that?
 heiko	blackburn: so I had some kind of list in mind which one can easily browse through
 blackburn	heiko: http://shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/python_modular_examples.html#python_modular_classifier_examples
 blackburn	# This example shows how to use a custom defined kernel function for training a # two class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a randomly generated # examples. The SVM regularization constant is set to C=1.
 blackburn	# In this example we demonstrate how to use SVMs in a domain adaptation # scenario. Here, we assume that we have two problem domains, one with # an abundance of training data (source domain) and one with only a few # training examples (target domain).
 blackburn	blablba
 heiko	I see
 heiko	so just comments
 heiko	cool
 heiko	I never saw that :)
 heiko	maybe I will just add comments to the existing examples in that case
 heiko	sorry for always not knowing about things :D
 heiko	blackburn:  syntax highlighting would be cool :)
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 blackburn	heiko: ipython notebooks actually
 blackburn	is the thing I would like to see
 heiko	blackburn, this would be ultra cool
 blackburn	heiko: takes time and work..
 heiko	true
 heiko	I mean just having a few scentences is already worth more than nothing
 heiko	since once can search that
 heiko	like: custom kernel
 heiko	or similar
 shogun-buildbot	build #866 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/866  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 blackburn	heiko: about active subset stack
 blackburn	heiko: it failed in GPs
 blackburn	heiko: I added a NULL check in some method a few weeks ago

 heiko	blackburn, I think this should be fine
 heiko	if the parameter is null, it just wont build a parameter dictionary
 heiko	but parameters need to be allowed to be null
 heiko	I actually dont really know that jacob did with these parameter dictionaries
 heiko	blackburn: Perceptron algorithm did not converge after 1000 iterations.
 heiko	what about this thing
 heiko	that happens from time to time
 blackburn	heiko: it is random iirc
 heiko	yes, probably
 blackburn	heiko: our test data is not linearly separable
 blackburn	or not easy sepeerable
 blackburn	:)
