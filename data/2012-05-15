 sonne|work	gsomix: or can you finish the dynarray stuff?
 gsomix	sonne|work, exams will be in June. I just studied yesterday material for future research.
 sonne|work	I see
 gsomix	sonne|work, about dynarray. I need only add some doc's in code.
 sonne|work	gsomix: so you finished the dynamicobjectarray stuff too?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep, yep.
 sonne|work	great!
 sonne|work	I would rather merge it now and you add the doc during the day or so
 gsomix	sonne|work, ok, just a sec.
 gsomix	sonne|work, please, check it.
 gsomix	need to go at uni

 sonne|work	n4nd0: regarding dotfeatures - so you would derive from dot features and just put the labels inside them and implement new dense_dot etc operations using labels, input features and whatever Phi is wanted - right?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: hey! sorry I didn't notice the bell rang
 n4nd0	yes, that's exactly my idea
 n4nd0	sonne|work: do you think it is ok?
-!- Marty28 [~marty@cable-158-181-77-81.cust.telecolumbus.net] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes - makes a lot of sense though I would derive 'StructuredDotFeatures' or so first (that have a StructuredLabel) and then from that the other classes
 n4nd0	sonne|work: all right
 n4nd0	sonne|work: thank you, by the way, did you have time to take a look to the PR?
 sonne|work	no not yet
 n4nd0	ok :)
 n4nd0	maybe someone can help me to make a decision, I need to select a course for next Fall
 n4nd0	I was looking into optimization courses
 n4nd0	and there is this one, Applied Linear Optimization, I don't know if the methods they teach there are interesting in machine learning
 n4nd0	some of these methods are simplex, interior methods, stochastic programming, Lagrangian relaxation, integer programming, subgradient
 n4nd0	any idea??
 sonne|work	yes they are...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: cool, thank you :)
 n4nd0	I will take that course then

 n4nd0	is that right?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	this week
 n4nd0	where is it?
 wiking	in baltimore
 n4nd0	nice
 n4nd0	are you presenting something there?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	one of my paper
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.54.38] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	hey, hey
 n4nd0	wiking: I wish you luck with it ;)
 n4nd0	hey gsomix
 gsomix	I got the first primitive task related to research.
 n4nd0	wiking: I pushed some SO stuff to the repo, let me know if you have any comment related to your latent features part
 n4nd0	gsomix: cool! what is it about?
 wiking	aaah cool
 wiking	i'll take a look at it now thnx for mentioning
 n4nd0	wiking: I think we could provide another type of pointer function in StructuredModel for the latent features part
 n4nd0	wiking: what do you think?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ahh btw would it be possible to not use function pointers?
 sonne|work	but instead some say CArgMax class or so
 gsomix	n4nd0, optics. calculation of the optical element that gives a uniformly illuminated circle.
 gsomix	sonne|work, what about patch?
 sonne|work	gsomix: did you fix the SG_ADD stuff?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm we could do it like that but I liked the idea that wiking suggested since in that way the user that wants to use SO wouldn't need to create any class but rather just define some functions
 gsomix	sonne|work, give me five minutes
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I don't see the difference...
 sonne|work	except that I don't like function ptrs...
 gsomix	sonney2k, what about add_vector?
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@141.23.65.251] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	gsomix: IIRC that should work too
 n4nd0	sonne|work: so your plan would be to provide a CArgMax base class and extend it for every different argmax method?
 gsomix	sonne|work, ok. but add_vector have num_of_elements argument. just another SG_ADD for num?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes like CLossFunction
 sonne|work	gsomix: errm I don't know by heart
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok ... why don't you like function pointers? :)
 sonne|work	gsomix: if it doesn't work we stick with SG_ADD
 sonne|work	n4nd0: hard to read
 gsomix	sonne|work, I see.
 gsomix	sorry
 sonne|work	n4nd0: have a look at Lossfunction - it is very easy to understand - have a function ptr somewhere and you need heavy documentation...
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@141.23.65.251] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 sonne|work	n4nd0: in addition, some argmax functions are *very* hefty so you want to split them up into several small functions
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think you have just saved me some work with the CLossFunction class :)
 sonne|work	heh
 n4nd0	I defined a new one for that but it looks like that one is the same we need in SO
 wiking	sonney2k: the difference is huge
 wiking	sonney2k: a lot of code duplication for no use
 wiking	sonney2k: if u take a class inheritance then you already have to take care of ctors, dtors
 wiking	and of course the actual implementation of the overridden function
 wiking	and all this because you want a different way to calculate a given function
 wiking	n4nd0: just checking your commits
 sonne|work	wiking: but that is not just a small function
 wiking	well for me an argmax function in case of latent variable is about 5 lines
 wiking	and PSI is quite the same
 sonne|work	it is sth. like viterbi etc
 sonne|work	so it can be HUGE
 wiking	and?
 wiking	i still don't see the point that depending on a size of a function
 sonne|work	wiking: you will need ~5 helper functions to keep it tractable
 wiking	that would justify to wrap the whole thing into a class
 sonne|work	and these are better suited to be in a class
 sonne|work	wiking: it is the same rationale why we have CLossFunction as class
 wiking	n4nd0: commented
 n4nd0	wiking: thank you

@sonney2k	gsomix, btw what else did we have in the queue?
@sonney2k	I mean on your TODO list?
 gsomix	sonney2k, save/loads, titled features with CMap and consts for methods in features.
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, blackburn have some bloody task for me.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh load/save... it seems like we need them sometimes
@sonney2k	gsomix, ignore him :D
@sonney2k	gsomix, so the load/save stuff is on hold until further notice
@sonney2k	we realized that it is nice to be able to load e.g. old svm light ascii files etc
@sonney2k	or ascii features etc
@sonney2k	however usually not any other Machine - so removing the functions there was ok
@sonney2k	gsomix, what is consts for methods in features?
 gsomix	sonney2k, just add 'const' keywords.
 gsomix	for methods, that should be const.
* sonney2k considers const useless
@sonney2k	anyway
@sonney2k	feel free
@sonney2k	gsomix, I think after this we should do some bigger task
@sonney2k	gsomix, what do you prefer the swig director classes stuff?
@sonney2k	or the x-validation typemaps?
@sonney2k	all heavy stuff...
 gsomix	sonney2k, director classes, I think.
@sonney2k	I attempted the first one but failed
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	so in this case I would suggest you
@sonney2k	1) write some small example C++ class with just one virtual set/get method for some integer
@sonney2k	2) wrap this class with swig to python
@sonney2k	3) test if you can get/set stuff from python
@sonney2k	4) enable directors
@sonney2k	5) overload the C++ set function within python
@sonney2k	6) test if it works :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, does that make sense to you?
@sonney2k	if it works you have to figure out why it crashes when done from shogun....
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep. I would do it anyway.
@sonney2k	gsomix, the x-validation task is probably easier
@sonney2k	it would mean to create typemaps for some more complex python objects and to construct some model selection stuff based on this
@sonney2k	gsomix, I have to talk to heiko how we want it to look like but it will be some list/dictionaries/tuples to parse no more
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh note I will be away for some time in june so we need sth where you know what to do
@sonney2k	gsomix, in worst case you have to start to remove ASSERT() and replace them with meaningful error msgs (SG_ERROR("...")) when you get stuck :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, the director stuff is probably most interesting/difficult, the x-validation typemaps most useful for shogun people
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. I need some time for planning.
 gsomix	because I have exams in early June.
@sonney2k	got to leave train

 puffin444	Hey
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	puffin444: how is it going?
 puffin444	It's going well so far. I hope to make a presentation about my project next Wednesday.
 n4nd0	puffin444: the diagrams in your mail look nice by the way ;)
 puffin444	Thanks! I hope the design makes sense.
 puffin444	blackburn, do you have any advice on presenting shogun?
 blackburn	in general?
 n4nd0	puffin444: have you seen some of the videolectures of shogun?
 n4nd0	they could be a source of inspiration
 puffin444	blackburn: Yes. I seem to recall that you once made a similar presentation, yes?
 puffin444	n4ndo: Sure. Where are these videolectures?
 blackburn	no I didn't :)
 puffin444	blackburn: Maybe it was sonney2k then.
 blackburn	yes probably
 n4nd0	puffin444: there is one here by master S?ren http://videolectures.net/icml2010_sonnenburg_shog/
 n4nd0	I think there are other videos as well in videolectures.net
 blackburn	I have some suggestions though
 puffin444	n4ndo: Thanks, this looks helpful
 n4nd0	puffin444: and there are some other links at shogun's homepage, just look for videolecture
 n4nd0	puffin444: no problem, just take into account that some of the things there may be a bit outdated
 n4nd0	blackburn: right ^?
 puffin444	What are your suggestions?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes can be outdate
 blackburn	d
 blackburn	puffin444: stress that we have a lot of interfaces and we still tend to be largescale
 puffin444	blackburn: Will do.
 blackburn	you can also claim it is used not only for bioinf
 blackburn	I use it for kind of computer vision task (traffic sign recognition)
 puffin444	I still don't have a time length for the presentation though. They call them "lightning talks", so I suspect they are short.
 puffin444	Absolutely. I will mention examples of applications.
 blackburn	it is important because for a while shogun was really biased to bioinf
 blackburn	but for now we have no active bioinformatician developers
 puffin444	I'll try to come up with a rough collection of slides in the next few days or so and put them on the mailing list for review.
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	another idea could be to describe how cool shogun will be after this gsoc :)
 puffin444	I'll definitely emphasize that :)
 blackburn	puffin444: I can clarify what are our tasks about if you need it

 puffin444	I am also unsure about my audience. I don't know how much they know about Statistics/Machine Learning vs. Computer Programming.
 blackburn	I would rather assume they are totally lame in ML
 puffin444	Frankly the host hasn't given me much information yet, so it looks like I'll have to pry it out of him :)
 puffin444	Oh and I have a question about the ModelSelection framework
 blackburn	so what is the question? ;)
 puffin444	For hyperparameter learning I'm trying to minimize a log negative marginal likelihood function
 puffin444	But it appears that modelselection uses a crossvalidation class to optimize quantites such as accuracy, precision, etc.
 puffin444	My fear is that right now it would not make sense to use the ModelSelection framework for hyperparameter learning. Should I modify the framework to incorporate more general evalution?
 blackburn	puffin444: so you need no xval here?
 puffin444	I do not believe so. I am not sure it makes sense to use cross validation to minimize the lnml function.
 puffin444	I'll see what Oliver says about too.
 blackburn	puffin444: it looks like you can implement your own modelselection interface based class w/o using crossvalidation
 puffin444	Are you suggesting a separate interface for use only with GPs?
 blackburn	puffin444: no I mean all you need is to implement a class with your own select_model()
 blackburn	under this ModelSelection interface
 blackburn	wouldn't it work?
 puffin444	Yes. I'll take a look at doing that.
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.2.22] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	it could be a little confusing that we have null crossvalidation here but I think it is ok
 puffin444	I'll try to update the diagrams then with an addtional modelselection interface.

 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok I will take a look into how to do this now
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw I hope you get more feedback
 n4nd0	sonney2k: thank you very much for asking the others about it :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: about the function pointers thing, after the discussion with wiking, are you sure that you want the argmax following the strategy used in CLoss?
-!- Marty28 [~marty@cable-158-181-77-81.cust.telecolumbus.net] has quit [Quit: Colloquy for iPad - http://colloquy.mobi]
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	look at structure/DynProg.{cpp,h} for an argmax for segmentations
@sonney2k	it is ~2.5kLoC
 n4nd0	a lot
 n4nd0	it looks reasonable to have classes for that yeah, fut I king of liked the other idea too
 n4nd0	look comfortable
 n4nd0	it looks*
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so I guess that for the delta loss the same, no function pointers
 n4nd0	I will ask Nico about that tomorrow, but I think that there is no need for StructuredLoss, I understand that its functionality is the same of the CLoss you pointed out before for me
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah nico is not so familiar with shogun internals
@sonney2k	...though an SO expert
 n4nd0	he's helping me a lot with his indications
 n4nd0	I make backups of the IRC conversations just in case :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, too bad that you are not discussing here on the channel...
@sonney2k	you really should...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I thought of it but wouldn't that be a little like spamming the chat? I mean we would take over control of it for a while
 n4nd0	but for me it is ok to do it ...
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no it is what this channel is for
 n4nd0	all right
@sonney2k	I also only discuss things with gsomix in public here...
@sonney2k	so all my screwups are documented :D
@sonney2k	so I highly prefer many people to screw up here such that I can hide mine in the mass of others :)
* gsomix woke up.
 gsomix	sonney2k, I prefer a director classes as next task.
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I like your strategy to hide screw ups :P
@sonney2k	gsomix, all right then director classes it is
@sonney2k	gsomix, just make sure you have some result within the next week - otherwise I won't be able to help if this all fails...
@sonney2k	that means attempted 1-6)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that is why no one wanted to post on mloss.org initially :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, >> that means attempted 1-6) | could not parse. what do you mean?
 gsomix	good night guys
@sonney2k	gsomix, the plan I outlined above
 n4nd0	good night gsomix
@sonney2k	<sonney2k> 1) write some small example C++ class with just one virtual set/get method for some integer
