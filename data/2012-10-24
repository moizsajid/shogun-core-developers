 n4nd0	atm I am checking the reference Cheng sent to the mailing list
 n4nd0	wiking: do you know something about image segmentation using something similar to our so-svm?
 wiking	n4nd0: heheheh
 wiking	n4nd0: yeah i've checked that paper as well
 wiking	i've seen some paper afaik
 wiking	but i have no fucking clue about img segmentation on the other hand
 wiking	i know graph cuts :)
 wiking	and that's it :>
 n4nd0	hehe ok :)
 wiking	fing help
 wiking	i mean hell
 wiking	who the fuck creates big-endian formated images
 wiking	:D

@sonney2k	n4nd0, up early?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah! :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, why that?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am trying to find out what can I prepare using the SO framework for Christian's talk
@sonney2k	n4nd0, good excuse :D

 wiking	blackburn: any clearcases today? :D
 blackburn	wiking: SURE
 blackburn	my life is empty without CC
 wiking	blackburn: btw how do u like travis' message ?:) specially designed it for u
 wiking	;)P
 blackburn	yeah I like it
 wiking	ls -la
 wiking	wrong window
 blackburn	good you didn't wrongmessaged sth like 'cd porno/hard/german'
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	wiking: what are you working on lately? a lot of sparse stuff, where is it used?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n183-p114.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
 wiking	blackburn: i'd like to use it
 wiking	blackburn: in my so-svm/latent sosvm implementation
 blackburn	wiking: I just wojnder what is the problem you solve
 blackburn	I mean sparse presentations are not so often used in case of local descriptors or anything like that
 wiking	ah malignant cell detection in xray chest images
 wiking	but it's not about the descriptors
 wiking	it's about the representation of PSI features
 wiking	in so-svm and latent sosvm
 wiking	a lot of times you have like [0,...,0]_n [nnz]_m [0,...,0]_k like spi vectors
 wiking	*psi
 wiking	so you have zero padding before and after the nnz values
 wiking	in the generated psi vector
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	so i want to be able to represent psi both as dense and sparse vectors
 wiking	and for that i have this dotfeatures story
 wiking	but it's a pain in the ass
 blackburn	sonney2k: it seems that SLEP problem is finally solved
@sonney2k	n4nd0: blackburn shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclogs/
 blackburn	ha
 n4nd0	oh your widget application is ready
 n4nd0	nice!
@sonney2k	the calendar arrived
 n4nd0	only 2011 visible so far?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: any new about the doc sprint, are we applying finally?
@sonney2k	ugh bug :-!
@sonney2k	n4nd0: sure ! we are
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :)
 n4nd0	so you take care of the application?
@sonney2k	n4nd0: btw 2012 is in chatlogs but at the very bottom.
@sonney2k	yeah I have to do it
@sonney2k	maybe we should reverse the order
 n4nd0	oh yes 2012 is there
 n4nd0	I scrolled down too fast :S sorry
 n4nd0	probably from newest date to oldest is more useful, I think
@sonney2k	ptizoom: did you checkout git master?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, now it is reversely ordered http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/contact/irclogs/
 n4nd0	wiking: ping
 n4nd0	wiking: do you happen to know why I get this error ERROR MSK_RES_ERR_SPACE - 'Out of space.' in a problem that I could solve before?
 n4nd0	wiking: I have just downloaded a new license in case it was that
 n4nd0	but the error remains
 n4nd0	sonney2k: nice!
@sonney2k	blackburn, the website is still confusing to me
@sonney2k	I think we should move http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/contribute
@sonney2k	to the dev page
@sonney2k	blackburn, and look here http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/ourteam
@sonney2k	nothing on it
 blackburn	I'll put my drunk photo out there
@sonney2k	maybe we better remove it
@sonney2k	this info is under contacts anyways
 blackburn	not really I'd like it to stay
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok then write some longer content about it
 blackburn	with our photos and things like
@sonney2k	like list of all developers with coordinates etc
@sonney2k	please do
@sonney2k	highly needed
 blackburn	'ich bin sergej ich liebe das vodka'
 blackburn	not now I am at job :D
@sonney2k	later then
* sonney2k is moving contribute over to dev
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think the references should be some subpage of about
@sonney2k	it is not really helpful for users...

 blackburn	KAWABANGA
 blackburn	BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH
 blackburn	<3 shindows
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	hehe
@sonney2k	n4nd0, blackburn http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/contributions
@sonney2k	is this better?
@sonney2k	(as in more useful?)
@sonney2k	question is where should the 'we participate in gsoc2012' from http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/information go?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am ok with place it is now
 blackburn	it is a good advertisement :D
@sonney2k	no it is basically hidden too deep
@sonney2k	hard to find...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: maybe we should include the HMSVM toolbox http://mloss.org/software/view/250/ in acknowledgements?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please do it
@sonney2k	actually also the GP toolbox
@sonney2k	still a long way to go...
@sonney2k	the dev page becomes useful
@sonney2k	btw, I realize we have no explicit download page
@sonney2k	maybe we should rename news to something else
 n4nd0	sonney2k: shogun-toolbox.org/admin to login and after edit?
 ptizoom	sonney2k: I have not rebased for a while....
@sonney2k	ptizoom, well don't rebase but just check it out
 ptizoom	 sonney2k: do I need to?
 blackburn	ich mochte schlafen
 blackburn	!!
 ptizoom	ihren Sie erm?den
@sonney2k	n4nd0, admin/ sure
 n4nd0	sonney2k: contributions updated
@sonney2k	ptizoom, please test a clean git master and then try ./configure --interfaces=perl_modular
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah ... I was missing the slash at the end, blackburn pointed it out :)
 ptizoom	sonney2k: I see...
 n4nd0	blackburn: what about the chef port?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you please add http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code
@sonney2k	are GP stuff is based on theirs
 n4nd0	I just closed the window but yes I can do that
@sonney2k	please do
@sonney2k	ptizoom, we should get that to work in master
@sonney2k	then we can add examples etc from your stuff
 n4nd0	sonney2k: done
 n4nd0	I am adding the matlab DR toolbox too
 ptizoom	sonney2k: I have not much to test thy perl_modular, excepted my humoungus  batch  I put in tests/integration/pdl_modular
@sonney2k	ptizoom, well test if it compiles!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, thx
@sonney2k	ptizoom, then some example - if that works we can continue
 blackburn	n4nd0: chef is a long run project sure
 blackburn	we are in design phase
 blackburn	we've got to estimate impact and regressions
 blackburn	i.e. how much money we can earn from that :D
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	need a break, see you later!

 blackburn	n4nd0: got any ideas for example?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yep
 n4nd0	I am working hard on it since this afternoon
 blackburn	can I help you?
 n4nd0	let's see if I get sth cool in time
 n4nd0	mmm I don't know
 n4nd0	brb in a minute
 n4nd0	blackburn: I tell you the idea
 n4nd0	so in this pattern recognition course I finished last week we developed an isolated word recognizer using HMMs
 n4nd0	let's say you want to recognize numbers from 1-5
 n4nd0	then you train 5 HMMs, each HMM models a number (the word)
 n4nd0	for new examples, you just run an algorithm in every HMM and recognize with the HMM that gives highest score
 n4nd0	I aim at doing exactly the same thing, but training HM-SVMs instead of HMMs
 blackburn	can you describe example of data?
 blackburn	so it is a text?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	it is speech
 blackburn	image?
 blackburn	ahh
 n4nd0	you record your voice saying 'one'
 n4nd0	saying 'two'
 n4nd0	etc
 n4nd0	do you see what I mean?
 blackburn	yes probably
 n4nd0	I just need to implement a new StateModel
 n4nd0	so far we've got in shogun the twoState
 n4nd0	for speech recognition you use other kind of state models
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you think it sounds ok?
 n4nd0	I think it is something I should be able to do for tomorrow and prepare a couple of slides with fancy pictures

@sonney2k	ptizoom, ahh in SGBase.i
@sonney2k	hmmhh quite cluttered - lemme try
 n4nd0	sonney2k: can I ask you a question regarding PLiFs?
@sonney2k	I have to enter the airplane now
