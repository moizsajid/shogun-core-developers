 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm sometimes it takes a bit to receive @shogun-toolbox.org mails
 n4nd0	I don't really know why
 sonne|work	n4nd0: greylisting
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	sonne|work: has it appeared in your mailbox already?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes for quite some time it is sitting there
 sonne|work	n4nd0: It is a bit difficult for me to give proper feedback. In the end it is christoph who should decide what he considers most important...

 ankkitta	So You mean essentially its all those three commands , ./configure make sudo make install ? isn't it??
 ankkitta	Am I working in the right dir ?
 blackburn	ankkitta: you placed a space after /

 annkitta	sorry for the internet problem :/ Blackburn Should it work no..?according to you?
 annkitta	hae I chosen the right folder?I tried ls it containes/shows only INSTALL file in there
 annkitta	blackburn:there?
 n4nd0	hey annkitta
 annkitta	yeah!help :P
 n4nd0	first, why not to use the latest version? 2.1.0 was released a few days ago
 n4nd0	annkitta: http://shogun-toolbox.org/
 annkitta	yeah I am downloading this very version now
 annkitta	:)
 n4nd0	and second, you should extract the archive, change to the src directory
 n4nd0	and then you should be able to run configure without problems
 annkitta	oh cool!lemme see,,but i ll be needing those packages right?atlas/lapack/lua/octave/r?and direstory?src right?
 n4nd0	annkitta: it depends on what parts of shogun you want to use
 n4nd0	annkitta: you need lua if you are going to use the lua interface
 n4nd0	the same applies for octave
 n4nd0	atlas, lapack and eigen3 are required for many features of shogun
 annkitta	ok lemme check!thanks for the help ,I shall let you know in case,dear :)
 annkitta	src as in /src rite?
 n4nd0	src inside the root directory of the extracted archive
 n4nd0	issue pwd and paste the output here if you are in doubt

 n4nd0	sonne|work: Christoph said he cannot make it unfortunately :(
 n4nd0	he suggested me to contact Sebastian Nowozin or Dhruv Batra
 n4nd0	I already contacted Sebastian and he couldn't either so I will try with Dhruv
 blackburn	whoo searching for a mentor

 blackburn	bang
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ^
 n4nd0	blackburn: you ok? :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: what about georg idea?
 n4nd0	blackburn: Georg idea is cool, but he said he could co-mentor the project
 blackburn	n4nd0: co-mentor what?
 n4nd0	someone who could give support in CRF and inference in PGMs would be very useful
 n4nd0	blackburn: co-mentor a project in structured learning
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: let me forward you the mail I wrote to Christoph and Soeren this morning
 n4nd0	blackburn: I put together some of the ideas Georg suggested and some of the stuff I think would be cool to have with learning CRFs (or graphs for that matter)
 blackburn	n4nd0: I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will ask Andreas Mueller too xD
 blackburn	hahaha
 n4nd0	actually, for everything I am doing with CRFs now his pystruct is turning out to be terribly useful
 blackburn	n4nd0: would be nice to be terribly useful too
 blackburn	competition is what makes world go round :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: indeed
 n4nd0	blackburn: but hey, he doesn't have bundle methods
 n4nd0	blackburn: my CRF director should be able to use them ;)
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: directors could be pretty slow though
 sonne|work	n4nd0: did you ask sebastian nowozin?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, I asked him before Christoph
 sonne|work	he said no?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yes, he couldn't make it. He said being microsoft research puts commitments to what he is able to do outside the company
 n4nd0	whatever that means (time constraint or something else)
 sonne|work	yeah I guess he is busy...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I am going to ask Patrick Pletscher too I think
 n4nd0	http://www.pletscher.org/
 n4nd0	he has some structured learning stuff in github and does research on that
 sonne|work	yeah I don't know him though
 sonne|work	but jobu :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I will CC you again, sorry for the spam, but it probably makes it look more serious :)
 sonne|work	just do
 blackburn	n4nd0: CC marissa mayer and corinna cortes ;)
 blackburn	I usually CC larry page
 n4nd0	hahaha
 n4nd0	blackburn: nothing compared to CC-ing the captain :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: in case you don't know captain blueberry here he is http://www.wdrmaus.de/kaeptnblaubaerseite/
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have no clue!
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	no word I understand :D
 blackburn	I have no idea what I am clicking to

 blackburn	n4nd0: add a .git folder to repo

 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	n4nd0: I commited sutff
 blackburn	n4nd0: any progress on d3.js?
 n4nd0	blackburn: that is what someone has done when github is down

 n4nd0	sonney2k: both of them answered being interested hehe
@sonney2k	n4nd0, difficult situation
@sonney2k	the graphlab guy might be more suited though but you could ask if he would be OK with a co-mentor...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: for the moment I will send Patrick a similar mail to the other one
 n4nd0	and let's see what they think once they know responsabilities and project more in detail
 n4nd0	sonney2k: what would you say for a mentor's workload time estimate?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well you know it exactly
 n4nd0	sonney2k: mm I am not sure, it gets difficult when trying to get a #hours
 n4nd0	roughly I would say less than 10hr per week, I am not sure though
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you think ^?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, even less I would say. Maybe initial week 10 but then 1-2 hours no more
@sonney2k	but it depends on the student of course
