 wiking	duuuude
 blackburn_	wiking: who's that for? :)
 wiking	well it's about streaming features
 blackburn_	first rule of streaming features
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@194.78.35.195] has joined #shogun
 wiking	no wonder it leaks
 blackburn_	no, first rule is never talk about streaming features obviously ;)
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	better leaks than GC :)
 blackburn_	really?
 wiking	who's Shashwat Lal Das?
 blackburn_	our former gsoc
 blackburn_	I'd say alumni
 blackburn_	:D
 wiking	:>
 sonne|work	wiking: btw you can find the git tag in any shogun 2.0 .tar.bz2 in src/lib/versionstring.h
 blackburn_	wiking: if you have any questions to shashwatted code ask heiko
 blackburn_	he is shashwat now
 wiking	:D
 wiking	sonne|work: do u have it hand?
 sonne|work	no
 wiking	downloading ...
 wiking	stay tuned
 blackburn_	wiking: okay joking - shashwat code is ok
 blackburn_	baozeng is not :D
 blackburn_	the-guy-who-allocates-data-on-stack
 wiking	well yeah
 wiking	that's another story
 blackburn_	okay time to get hooome

 wiking	sonne|work: i've downloaded tar.bz2
 wiking	sonne|work: should i build it inorder to have that src/lib/versionstring.h?
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	it is there already
 wiking	i've just downloaded the tar.bz2 from the shogun site
 wiking	and there's no such thing there
 sonne|work	src/shogun/lib/versionstring.h
 wiking	0x9c8012f
 wiking	the revision
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	git show --pretty='format:%h'|head -1
 wiking	how do u convert that into a git commit number?
 sonne|work	that's how it is created
 sonne|work	just do git show 9c8012f
 wiking	fatal: ambiguous argument '9c8012f': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
 sonne|work	excellent
 sonne|work	something went wrong.
 wiking	:(
 sonne|work	wiking: does it work in your current checkout?
 wiking	git show --pretty='format:%h'|head -1 ?
 sonne|work	I mean the id from your current build
 sonne|work	that you find in your git-master src/shogun/lib/versionstring.h
 sonne|work	?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	that works
 sonne|work	looking at the logs I think we released 15ed29239e2f83e7cd8c5097d9180999cffeab56
 wiking	ok
 wiking	let's tag that then
 wiking	:D
 wiking	and make a branch of it
 sonne|work	we should compare it to the stuff in the tar.bz2 before we do it
 sonne|work	I have no idea what could have happened ...
 sonne|work	well release script needed a rewrite to work with new layout / git and we didn't release that often since then
 sonne|work	so it probably still has issues
 wiking	we should test it before the next release then
 wiking	btw
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/features/streaming/StreamingFeatures.h#L88
 wiking	can we agree to throw this ctor out?
 wiking	as it doesn't do anything
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/features/streaming/StreamingFeatures.cpp#L28
 wiking	sonne|work: ^
 sonne|work	huh?!
 wiking	same for https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/features/streaming/StreamingDotFeatures.h
 wiking	sonne|work: check it out
 wiking	 :)
 sonne|work	that oen used to do sth
 sonne|work	one
 sonne|work	needs more inspection - maybe some code got removed
 wiking	ok i'm not going to go into that then now
 sonne|work	it was used to read in files that have a label and features
 wiking	sonne|work: yes but now that is moved
 wiking	sonne|work: to StreamingSparseFeatures
 wiking	and DenseFeatures
 sonne|work	ahh ok
 sonne|work	then it certainly makes sense yes
 wiking	sonne|work: ok then i'll prepare now a fix

 wiking	there you go fixes
 wiking	ooooh
 wiking	we have a nice bug in CMulticlassLibSVM
 wiking	or at least there's a problem with ./classifier_multiclasslibsvm
 wiking	btw anyone tested shogun with python3.0?
 wiking	:)

 wiking	17:25 < wiking> btw anyone tested shogun with python3.0?
 wiking	17:25 < wiking> :)
 blackburn	wiking: what is da bug?
 wiking	blackburn: try running ./classifier_multiclasslibsvm with HEAD
 wiking	it fails here
 wiking	multiclass/MulticlassLibSVM.cpp:190
 wiking	190REQUIRE(set_svm(idx, svm),"SVM set failed");
 wiking	that's line 190
 wiking	idx value there is -2
 blackburn	woopie doopie
 blackburn	2 classes
 blackburn	okayyyyy
 blackburn	wiking: here you go
 wiking	waiting :)
 wiking	where r u shogungit?! :)

 wiking	cwidmer: hey
 cwidmer	hi there
 wiking	cwidmer: do you happen to have any DNA/gene dataset where one has to find motifs?
 cwidmer	well, I can give you some splice site data... another one would be gene starts
 cwidmer	what are you trying to do?#
 wiking	i'm really not into this topic but
 cwidmer	but?
 cwidmer	you got interested ;)?
 wiking	Motifs are repeated patterns in DNA sequences that are believed to have biological significance. Our dataset consists of ARSs (autonomously replicating se- quences) screened in two yeast species S. kluyveri and S. cerevisiae. Our task is to predict whether a par- ticular sequence is functional (i.e., whether they start the replication process) in S. cerevisiae and to find out the motif responsible. All the native ARSs in S. cerevisiae are labeled as pos
 wiking	this is in a paper
 wiking	i was wondering whether there's a similar dataset available
 wiking	anywhere
 cwidmer	which paper is that?
 wiking	cwidmer: www.cs.cornell.edu/~cnyu/papers/icml09_latentssvm.pdf
 cwidmer	I see, and i guess you've checked if their data set is available (website, supplement, ask authors)?
 wiking	cwidmer: yeps
 wiking	unfortunately it's not
 wiking	but basically any similar problem for me would be good
 wiking	cwidmer: i mean yeah i've contacted them but unfortunately this dataset in particular cannot be handed out... private etc..
 cwidmer	hmm, too bad
 wiking	i've just seen your pull request
 cwidmer	so they do some labeled sequence learning on motifs?
 wiking	that's why i thought i give a shot to ask u something
 cwidmer	heh, sure
 wiking	well as much one can find out from their paper/code
 wiking	their data looks something like this: some_seq:1:1:ACGTACGT
 wiking	and then they try to find the starting position of the motif as well as classify it
 cwidmer	I have to read the data part in detail to see what's going on
 cwidmer	from glancing over it, it seems like a binary classification task
 cwidmer	with latent variables
 wiking	yes
 cwidmer	where label is, if functional or not
 cwidmer	and latent variable is motiv position
 cwidmer	motif
 wiking	indeed
 cwidmer	I was expecting SO
 wiking	yeah they didn't go that deep :)
 cwidmer	hmm, ok
 cwidmer	also, are they only looking for one particular motif?
 wiking	yes
 cwidmer	well
 cwidmer	and the sequences can be of variable length?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	if u have anything at hand that u could share for testing shogun's machine
 wiking	let me know :)
 cwidmer	so you're saying all those 'autonomously replicating sequences' are of identical length?
 wiking	cwidmer: well as far as i can see from the code
 cwidmer	well, there is something that a colleague of mine, sebi, worked on: KIRMES
 cwidmer	he is also looking at motifs in promoter sequences
 cwidmer	but several
 cwidmer	and he encodes their relative distances etc as features
 cwidmer	and learns on that
 cwidmer	http://raetschlab.org//suppl/kirmes/
 cwidmer	possibly, you can take a look at that
 cwidmer	but I suspect the problem is much harder than the latent svm paper one
 wiking	ok i'll check that one out
 wiking	get at least an idea :)
 cwidmer	just curious, what method do you want to test on this data?
 wiking	simple latent svm and latent so svm
 cwidmer	is the code in shogun ported from thorstens's tool or do we have a from scratch implementation?
 cwidmer	it is based on the same paper at least, right?
 wiking	cwidmer: we have both
 wiking	i mean i have it for so
 cwidmer	but what's in shogun is based on the "Learning Structural SVMs with Latent Variables" paper or something else?
 wiking	cwidmer: both
 wiking	cwidmer: i've tested on one dataset and the one i have from scratch implemented performs better than the algo in ""Learning Structural SVMs with Latent Variables"
 cwidmer	ah nice
 wiking	but i need more tests
 wiking	:>
 cwidmer	so what you've implemented from scratch is in libocas?
 wiking	the simple latent svm is based on libocas
 wiking	the latent so is based on the BMRM in shogun
 wiking	and i've made it possible to work with the primal mosek solver as well
 cwidmer	cool
 cwidmer	i'll check it out some time, seems interesting
 wiking	cwidmer: the latent so is not commited yet
 wiking	it's in my git stash for a long time now
