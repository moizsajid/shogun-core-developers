@lisitsyn	damn
@lisitsyn	damn!
@besser82	lisitsyn, lemme hear you say: What?!?

@lisitsyn	somehow I managed to fsck up rebase
@lisitsyn	besser82: is it safe to push force on feature branch?

@besser82	lisitsyn, the co-workers on that branch should know how to handle that :P
@lisitsyn	thankfully no co-workers
@besser82	lisitsyn, lucky ass!  XD
@lisitsyn	besser82: I messed up my PR
@besser82	lisitsyn, what? why?
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2675
@besser82	so which are the commits you wanted to push?
@besser82	and on what did you rebase?
@lisitsyn	besser82: on develop
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	I have no idea how I managed to do that
@lisitsyn	seemed normal thing to do
@besser82	lisitsyn, try to fix that by "git fetch --all"
@lisitsyn	besser82: I pushed these commits to the feature already
@lisitsyn	so I guess I have to cherry-pick them into different branch
@lisitsyn	and then reset and push back
@besser82	lisitsyn, nope
@lisitsyn	hmm what would you suggest?
@besser82	lisitsyn, which commits are wanted by you then?
@besser82	lisitsyn, gimme commit-sha plz...  I'll fix that f*cking mess ;)
@lisitsyn	besser82: hmm

@lisitsyn	+ e12a7f986d6c1524be62847fec3972a404cb5f70 Updated doc for some
@lisitsyn	then tell me how to fix that :)

@lisitsyn	how the fsck
@besser82	lisitsyn, ^ there it is done :D
@lisitsyn	besser82: what did you do?
@besser82	lisitsyn, fscking git-blackmagic  =)
@lisitsyn	tell me!
@lisitsyn	reset and cherry-pick?
@besser82	lisitsyn, i have shogun checkout
@besser82	lisitsyn, git fetch --all
@lisitsyn	ah so you created feature/some
@lisitsyn	checkouted I mean
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes
@lisitsyn	and pulled commits
@lisitsyn	and push force?
@besser82	lisitsyn, checkout already was present
@lisitsyn	ok cool
@besser82	lisitsyn, not pulled  ;)  just fetched from remote
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	fetched then applied
@besser82	lisitsyn, nope
@lisitsyn	??
@lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	lisitsyn, git fetch --all
@lisitsyn	what's the state of feature/some you had?
@besser82	lisitsyn, git rebase -i upstream/develop
@besser82	lisitsyn, d0e76e8~1
@lisitsyn	so interactive rebase?
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes on recent fetch of develop ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, not on local branch  :P
@lisitsyn	besser82: yeah you knew what you were doing
@lisitsyn	:D
@besser82	lisitsyn, as I said:  I have PhD in Git  :P
@besser82	stuff is not easy to tell...  If I would show you live, you'd say: damn, that freaking easy!  ;)
