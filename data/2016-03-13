 mizari	heya guys. wanna join GSoC, sorry for being late :s
 mizari	I'm interested in following ideas:
 mizari	linux part of https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_project_installation
 mizari	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_clean_up_infrastructure
 mizari	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2015_cluster_shogun if or when time's left
 mizari	I have little to none knowledge of ML, but I really wanna get into it
 mizari	so from shogun's GSoC I expect myself to improve my C++ skills and ML, so I can help after :p
 mizari	can I get someone to talk about it and pick up some tasks?

 BurningBear	hello, mizari. I am new here and I wanna join GSoC too.I am a student in China. maybe we can study and make progress together!
 mizari	thats nice, what is the idea you want to work on?
 BurningBear	I am interested in "Fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms"
 BurningBear	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/GSoC_2016_project_fundamental_usual_suspects
 mizari	two students could be there, sounds like a good idea
 mizari	I also like the project itself
 BurningBear	:) haha, I have little knowledge of ML too, so I think we must try our best to learn it!
 BurningBear	may I get your E-mail?
 mizari	PM'ed

 sanuj	HeikoS: how to generate least_squares_regression.dat?
@HeikoS	sanuj: hi
@HeikoS	run `make test`
 sanuj	oh
@HeikoS	and then check build/examples/meta/cpp/classifier/knn.dat
@HeikoS	if this is not clear from the Readme, please add it :)
 sanuj	HeikoS: i tried generate.py
@HeikoS	this file has to go to data/testsuite/meta/classifier/knn.dat
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool
@HeikoS	sanuj: no thats old
@HeikoS	the meta examples use something else
@HeikoS	please update any readme if you find something outdated
 sanuj	HeikoS:
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: great that you are using it, I am looking forward to see these cookpage example tests in action
 sanuj	i'll send a PR to shogun data for this
 sanuj	start a new PR for linear ridge regression cookbook
@HeikoS	sanuj: yes you have to update data
@HeikoS	and then use this updated data revision in your PR where you send the example, it will be two PRs
@HeikoS	sanuj: and please update the readme if you think it is not clear, so we dont have to explain this to 100 people again and again ;)
 sanuj	HeikoS: sure i'll update the readme
@HeikoS	sanuj: great thanks a lot
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	HeikoS: In this wiki https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Example_Generation

 sanuj	'real' is not mentioned. it was used at some point of time in knn.sg
@HeikoS	sanuj: this is not relevant fot the meta examples
@HeikoS	I see
 sanuj	HeikoS: using 'float' gives an error
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	good catch
@HeikoS	sanuj: that is in fact defined in the target jsons
@HeikoS	if you want to re-add this, check cpp.json, csharp.json and java.json
@HeikoS	they tell how the convertion works
@HeikoS	I just put in real for now
@HeikoS	could put in float as well
 sanuj	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	sanuj: but not important for now
@HeikoS	ill take care of it later
 sanuj	HeikoS: cool

 sanuj	HeikoS: can you review the content in updated lsr cookbook page? I'll put almost the same content in LinearRidgeRegression page also.
@HeikoS	sanuj: will do, but I have to fix the integration test file first. Not sure what the problem there is
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3064
@HeikoS	sanuj: I am currently preparing a talk for tomorrow, but will have a look a bit later
 sanuj	HeikoS: sure :)
@HeikoS	http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6006-learning-structured-densities-via-infinite-dimensional-exponential-families.pdf
@HeikoS	in case you like kernels ;)

@HeikoS	sanuj: I sent a fix for the integration text
@HeikoS	test
@HeikoS	once it is merged, you can use the example as inspiration again
@HeikoS	sanuj: note I changed my mind on evaluation, a sinmple case should be in there
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah i saw
@HeikoS	all real valued results are stored to file
@HeikoS	the problem was a wrong method call on the labels
@HeikoS	get_values rather than get_labels
@HeikoS	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/cookbook_pr/fed6c4075a52028fb11206ce2aafcdbf09411bce/examples/classifier/knn.html
 sanuj	HeikoS: how do you get the links to the buildbot cookbook builds? :P
 sanuj	HeikoS: and why do we have a buildbot when we have travis?
@HeikoS	sanuj: wiking did soem magic
@HeikoS	sanuj: we now generate the html output of the cookbook on the buildbot for every PR sent
@HeikoS	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun%20-%20PR
 sanuj	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	sanuj: and we have the buildbot because travis does not give us unlimited computation time or architectures
@HeikoS	we run shogun build and tests in all sorts of flavours, update the notebooks and doc online, etc
@HeikoS	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/waterfall
@HeikoS	you can see all the differnt OS there
@HeikoS	the cookbook feature is the best, since I can read the patches in rendered html rather than the source file itself
 sanuj	HeikoS: yeah i have seen those before.....
 sanuj	HeikoS: agreed about the cookbook build features
 sanuj	HeikoS: it's sweet
 sanuj	buildbot looks vast
 sanuj	HeikoS: i will have to update the PR before you review it....add back mean squared error etc

 sanuj	HeikoS: cool, i'll rebase and update my pR
 lisitsyn	hey
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no news yet
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi!
@HeikoS	news on website you mean?
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok
@HeikoS	about to merge first PR for cookbook
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hey just also wanted to follow up on this "show" listing thing
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh I could focus on that now
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: but!
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: need your advice ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's best short GP introduction you know?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the rasmussen book
@HeikoS	it is wonderful
@HeikoS	chapter 3
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	2
@HeikoS	the one on regression
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah that's true
 lisitsyn	so nothing better you know?
@HeikoS	3 is classification
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: i dont think one can do this better
 lisitsyn	hah I see cool
 lisitsyn	ok will use it then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: let me know if you have questions
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have to put GPs in a max 3 hour long lecture
@HeikoS	thats fine
@HeikoS	you need 3 slides
@HeikoS	http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf
@lambday	lisitsyn: you're giving lectures? where?
@HeikoS	figure 2.2
@lambday	I might use some of the slides to get introduced to GPs
@HeikoS	figure 2.5
 lisitsyn	lambday: yes, hse
@HeikoS	and one slide with the math
@HeikoS	eq 2.21
@HeikoS	thats all people need to know ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hah
@HeikoS	we also have this wonderful video lecture from the shogun workshop ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw my student is currently researching this spectral mixture kernel
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
@HeikoS	and?
@HeikoS	did he already realise it is crap? :)
 lisitsyn	its working but
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	I don't want it to be crap
@HeikoS	btw esben hopefully soon fixes his PR on that
@HeikoS	he impoemented it in shogun
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we had some daily activity dataset
 lisitsyn	and this thing made good enough regression
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: it is impossible to optimise the parameters
@HeikoS	other approaches are way more stable
 lisitsyn	what other approaches you could mention?
@HeikoS	1.) hand chosen kernel composition
@HeikoS	check the rassmussen bok
@HeikoS	http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW5.pdf
@HeikoS	section 5.4.3
@HeikoS	this is easier to tune
@HeikoS	or do something like they do in the automated statistician
@HeikoS	http://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/
@HeikoS	they have a grammar of kernel functions and automatically compose them
@HeikoS	http://www.automaticstatistician.com/static/abcdoutput/01-airline.pdf
@HeikoS	interpretable
@HeikoS	and automatic
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh but that's still kernel
 sanuj	HeikoS: I'm still getting empty least_squares_regression.dat
 lisitsyn	this makes me happy enough
 sanuj	HeikoS: using get_labels()
@HeikoS	sanuj: run make meta_examples
 sanuj	i did make examples
 sanuj	and make test
@HeikoS	sanuj: is the cpp code updated?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: the thing is that these standard models like ARMA don't do this kool enough
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: if you wanna be kool choose the SM kernel and witness it failing ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no honestly, I dont reccomend using it
@HeikoS	sanuj: its works here
 sanuj	HeikoS: this is what i have in cpp => auto output = labels_test->get_labels();
@HeikoS	and you are checking the correct .dat file?
 sanuj	HeikoS: okay, i'll see
@HeikoS	it is generated in the build dir
@HeikoS	not in data
@HeikoS	check build/tests/meta/generated_results/cpp/classifier
 sanuj	HeikoS: /home/sanuj/Projects/shogun/build_new/examples/meta/cpp/regression/least_squares_regression.dat
 sanuj	i deleted the old one just to make sure
@HeikoS	and still empty?
 sanuj	HeikoS: knn.dat is also empty
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	not for me
@HeikoS	git pull?
 sanuj	yeah i did git pull
 sanuj	i'll build a fresh build
@HeikoS	and make test fails?
@HeikoS	because the data file is NOT empty
 sanuj	HeikoS: all the generated tests passed
@HeikoS	and the knn.dat in data/testsuite/meta/classifier/?
 sanuj	HeikoS: is empty
@HeikoS	you have to do git pull in data then
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data/blob/master/testsuite/meta/classifier/knn.dat
 sanuj	oh wait
 sanuj	HeikoS: 160 - integration_meta_cpp-classifier_knn (Failed)
@HeikoS	you missed some git pull, pretty sure
@HeikoS	I gotta run now
@HeikoS	see you later :)
