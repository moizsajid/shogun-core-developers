 Guest23074	The original LibSVM has support for class weights (to compensate for unbalanced problems). Can Shogun also do that? Couldn't find anything in the documentation though..
 Guest23074	svm.set_C(c_neg,c_pos)  -- nice :)
 Guest23074	thx

 wiking	somebody review my PR and possibly apply: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/794
 sonne|work	wiking: Operators berween?
 wiking	sonne|work: yep
 wiking	but yeah i'll do some extra codes soon
 wiking	sonne|work: you reckon that SGSparseVectorEntry<T>* is sorted in SGSparsevector by feat_index?
 wiking	sonne|work: or should we add an option into SGSparseVector to do a sorting....
 wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: we should assume it is *always* sorted
 sonne|work	but document that we assume this!
 wiking	sonne|work: oke

 Guest88873	Is it correct that there's no CEvaluation subclass that allows setting specific losses for TP,TF,FP and FP ?
 blackburn	Guest88873: hey, could you please elaborate?
 blackburn	what do you mean by specific losses?
 Guest88873	I' like to parameters of an SVM based on its 'loss', where e.g. a false negative is considered 10 times worse than a false positive
 Guest88873	That would be: Loss = 10*FN +1*FP
 blackburn	Guest88873: oh got it, unfortunately that wasn't coded yet
 Guest88873	ok, thx
 blackburn	Guest88873: we have class computing all fps,tps,fns,tns so it could be easy to combine
 Guest88873	related question, could I add such a class on the run-time using Python (I think not, but I hope I'm wrong:) )
 Guest88873	No indeed, it wouldn't be that in C, but adding it in Python would be handier for experiments
 blackburn	Guest88873: yeah you could but it would require some C++ code again
 blackburn	Guest88873: we have such classes for structured risk models and kernels
 blackburn	it is called 'director' classes
 blackburn	i.e. it has a virtual method in C++ that may be overloaded by python code
 blackburn	and then used together with all the rest C++ code
 Guest88873	sounds perfect, I'll check it out
 Guest88873	thanks!
 blackburn	Guest88873: I'll add such class and example a little later today
 Guest88873	Thanks blackburn, that would be nice, since - for the moment - I don't get which classes this concerns and how to do it..
 wiking	blackburn: when u have time check out https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/794 ;)
 blackburn	wiking: yeah wanted to
 blackburn	will do in 5 mins
 wiking	okok cool thnx
 wiking	oh yeah i have a warning supresser fix
 wiking	blackburn: http://pastebin.com/afyeSf6N
 wiking	anything against it?
 blackburn	no, looks ok
 blackburn	what is the warning?
 wiking	well clang constantly giving me the warning
 wiking	when i compile SpareFeatures.cpp
 blackburn	ohh
 blackburn	that won't work!
 wiking	why not?
 blackburn	I mean it is broken already
 blackburn	one cannot simply copy array of referenced data
 wiking	well it's a copy constructor :)
 wiking	aaah ok
 wiking	i see
 wiking	because we store reference counter there in the beginning of that array
 wiking	right?
 wiking	orig.sparse_feature_matrix
 wiking	or why?
 blackburn	I mean we have to increase ref count of each vector
 blackburn	here comes da fix
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	CIA passed away again
 wiking	:(
 wiking	eh
 wiking	new (&sparse_feature_matrix[i]) SGSparseVector<ST>();
 wiking	i don't get this :D
 blackburn	wiking: in-place new shit
 wiking	so this is equivalent of sparse_feature_matrix[i] = new SGSparseVector<ST>();
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: calloc doesn't call constructors
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	sparse_feature_matrix[i] is not a pointer it is a memory area already
 blackburn	wiking: new creates object using memory provided by something, here we provide where to store the object
 blackburn	another hardcore option to cut off a leg
 blackburn	we like such things here for a reason I do not understand :D
 wiking	:>
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	so you basically have this "placement new"
 blackburn	some of shogun's code should be posted in some pornhub or whatever like that
 wiking	i.e. to just run a ctor on the already allocated memory
 blackburn	category 'extreme hardcore'
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/placement-new.html
 wiking	:D
 wiking	:DDD
 wiking	 // Line #3 (see "DANGER" below)
 wiking	:>
 wiking	lol "(if you don't know what "alignment" means, please don't use the placement new syntax). You have been warned."
 blackburn	// here your leg is being cutted off
 wiking	well yeah
 wiking	and is it aligned? :)
 wiking	on all the possible os/arch variations :)
 blackburn	good question
 wiking	as i know that osx malloc will give always give u an aligned memory
 blackburn	does sizeof takes alignment into account?
 blackburn	I hope it does
 wiking	but afaik that's only true for osx
 wiking	i remember when i had troubles with alignment (3 years ago)
 wiking	aligned memory by malloc was only true for osx
 wiking	linux and win did not do that
 blackburn	well actually I know it works now
 blackburn	on linux :)
 wiking	good :)
 blackburn	but better way is to use new[] here
 wiking	btw
 wiking	do u know why does it only work (clang_complete)
 wiking	if u do the include <eigen3/Eigen/Dense>
 wiking	?
 blackburn	oh some paths issue
 wiking	mmm yeah i guess so but why
 blackburn	well
 wiking	i cannot get any error out of vim
 blackburn	/usr/include/eigen3/
 blackburn	that's the path on my machine IIRC
 blackburn	not /usr/include/Eigen/
 wiking	for me it's /opt/local/include/eigen3
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but if you put
 wiking	-I/usr/include/eigen3
 wiking	in your clang_complete?
 wiking	.clang_complete
 blackburn	I didn't try
 blackburn	did you?
 wiking	does it work for you
 wiking	because i've tried
 wiking	and i get NO errors
 blackburn	so works seamless?
 wiking	but still clang complete doesn't want to work with SGVector or SGSparseVector for that matter
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	crazy
 wiking	could u try plz?
 blackburn	okay let me try
 shogun-buildbot	build #555 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/555  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 blackburn	boom
 blackburn	wiking: where to put .clang_complete?
 wiking	blackburn: hahaha have u seen that ? :)
 wiking	i mean the error
 wiking	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/555/steps/test%20libshogun/logs/stdio
 wiking	it's some crazy shit
 blackburn	heiko's thing
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	then i ignore
 blackburn	he got into that forest with an axe
 wiking	i put .clang_complete right in the root of shogun
 wiking	shogun/.clang_complete
 blackburn	in a root or src?
 blackburn	cause I work from src
 blackburn	usually
 wiking	-I./src
 wiking	-I/Users/wiking/mosek/6/tools/platform/osx64x86/h
 wiking	-I/opt/local/include
 wiking	-I/opt/local/include/eigen3
 wiking	-std=c++11
 wiking	-stdlib=libc++
 wiking	it looks like this for me
 wiking	in the root
 wiking	not the src
 wiking	since this way it works as well
 wiking	for examples
 wiking	as well
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	but u can put it in ./src
 wiking	the only difference would be then the first -I
 wiking	and i guess u don't need the last two flags
 wiking	as that's for c++11 support in clang
 blackburn	wiking: works
 wiking	no fucking way :D
 wiking	so you can do a this->
 wiking	in SGVector.cpp
 wiking	and it gives u the list
 wiking	w/o errors
 wiking	?
 blackburn	this-> doesn't work
 blackburn	hmm
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	then i guess it's the same for u as well
 blackburn	wiking: some things work
 wiking	in SGVector.cpp:123
 wiking	add a line
 wiking	and put
 wiking	x.
 blackburn	no, doesn't work
 wiking	and u should be able to get a list for SGSparseVector<T>
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	and what does
 wiking	:copen
 wiking	say
 wiking	?
 blackburn	clapack not found
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	i get
 wiking	the usual pattern not found
 wiking	but when i do :copen
 wiking	there's noooo error at all
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	do u have?
 blackburn	yeah clapack thing
 blackburn	may be it is the cause
 wiking	mmmm
 blackburn	let me fix that
 wiking	hehehe why don't i get any errors :D
 blackburn	sitll
 blackburn	still
 wiking	yep
 wiking	same here :)
 wiking	ok there's a python scrupt
 wiking	bin/cc_args.py
 wiking	in clang_complete
 wiking	it suppose to generate u the right .clang_complete
 wiking	:)
 wiking	now i'm gonna try that
 blackburn	hmm
 shogun-buildbot	build #556 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/556  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	ok i have to change that
 wiking	i mean in configure script
 wiking	streaming_vw_createcache_modular.py was broken before me right?
 blackburn	yeah I think so
 wiking	ok
 wiking	that python script doesn't help me at all
 wiking	:(
 shogun-buildbot	build #557 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/557  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 wiking	mm
 wiking	let g:clang_use_library = 1
 wiking	the completion is faster for me
 wiking	i wonder how can one debug clang_complete
 wiking	ah ok this is why
 wiking	"Instead of calling the clang/clang++ tool use libclang directly. This gives
 wiking	access to many more clang features. Furthermore it automatically caches all
 wiking	includes in memory. Updates after changes in the same file will therefore be a
 wiking	lot faster."

 blackburn	wiking: that option is killing my vim :)
 wiking	blackburn: does it have python support compiled?
 wiking	w/o that it won't work
 blackburn	how can I?
 blackburn	do tha
 wiking	i don't know how u can check it if it has python support added
 wiking	but for the configure of vim you should add something like this
 wiking	--enable-pythoninterp --with-python=${prefix}/bin/python2.7
 wiking	or wherever your python interpreter is
 wiking	can u do this in your vim
 wiking	:python print "helo"
 wiking	?
 wiking	if not then pythoninterp is not enabled
 wiking	that's why the  g:clang_use_library = 1 does not work
 wiking	otherwise i have no idea
 wiking	i had this problem but my vim didn't crash just got an error msg
 blackburn	I see thanks
 blackburn	it works
 wiking	heheh :)
 wiking	faster? :)
 blackburn	not yet
 blackburn	I meant python thing
 blackburn	oh works
 blackburn	okay let me try
 blackburn	argh -> doesn't work for me no matter where
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	maybe you need to set the library path
 wiking	where's your libclang.so?
 wiking	moreover, do you have one? :)
 blackburn	I think I have to compile shogun now
 wiking	no
 wiking	libclang.so should deal with it
 wiking	afaik
 wiking	but try
 wiking	i might be really wrong ehre :)
 blackburn	my installed headers are quite different from actual
 blackburn	so I have to install I think
-!- mode/#shogun [+o sonney2k] by ChanServ
 wiking	dude
 wiking	blackburn: still here?
 blackburn	wiking: yeao
 blackburn	yeap
 blackburn	wiking: I'm watching my parents' flight via flightradar24 :D
 wiking	blackburn: ehehe
 wiking	blackburn: i think the new latent so-svm just overexceeds any previously published solver's performance on one of the benchmark datasets :)
 wiking	both in training time and precision :)
 blackburn	O_O
 wiking	nyappp
 wiking	\o/
