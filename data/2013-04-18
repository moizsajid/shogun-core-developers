 sonne|work	saket: no there is no function like that
 sonne|work	so this would be a first small welcome patch
 saket	actaully, I needed that function for another patch ;p
 saket	I see that load(CFile) is also not implemented ..Can you please guide me on where (which code) to read about accessing reals from CFeatures
 saket	I see methods like "get_feature_matrix" and "get_feature_vector(index)" as functions in the python interface
 saket	but am i unable to locate them in the src folder
 saket	please help me out with this ..

@iglesiasg	sonne|work: I guess it is fine if I send the mail of the workshop around in the department where I am doing my master thesis?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: encouraged even!
@iglesiasg	cool, I will do it soon then
 sonne|work	wiking: so what do we do about the failing serialization_complex_example.py 1/2 ?
 sonne|work	I have absolutely no idea how to address that
 sonne|work	the only thing we can do is print the objects...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: let me know if I can help with this somehow, I don't really know how the serialization works but maybe I could prepare some tests or sth

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: the problem really is that this test works on all our machines but it does not on the travis buildbot
 sonne|work	absolutely no idea why not
@iglesiasg	aham I see
 Yanglittle	is there any body?
@iglesiasg	idd
 Yanglittle	 I have a problem , mkl.getsubkernelweights(numkernel), and it always say type error, and what is "int32_t &"  is there any body can help me
-!- abinash [75ef5e6e@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.117.239.94.110] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	Yanglittle: as I said in my mail try it without any parameter
@lisitsyn	Yanglittle: depends on what mkl here is though
 Yanglittle	i tried , it expected a argument.
@iglesiasg	Yanglittle: so you are using python_modular, don't you?
 Yanglittle	yes.
@iglesiasg	Yanglittle: I think it can be a problem with the type, that you have to say explicitily that what you are giving is an int32_t
@iglesiasg	but it is hard to tell if I cannot see the code you are using and the exact error
 Yanglittle	yeah ,ok  I run the mkl_multiclass_modualr and add the code "mkl.getsubkernelweights(3)" after mkl.train()
 Yanglittle	it says:  The debugged program raised the exception TypeError "in method 'MKLMulticlass_getsubkernelweights', argument 2 of type 'int32_t &'" File: /home/liyang/shogun/examples/documented/python_modular/mkl_multiclass_modular.py, Line: 75
@iglesiasg	Yanglittle: ok let me try it here
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	Yanglittle: try mkl.get_kernel().get_subkernel_weights()
@lisitsyn	Yanglittle: or rather
@lisitsyn	just call get_subkernel_weights() on your combined kernel
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: it is because of the & thing, no way to do that in python I think
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it is legacy from the days we had no sgvector
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: mmm why to use & when there is no sgvector?
@iglesiasg	it is not  like passing a pointer, int32_t*
@iglesiasg	probably I am getting something wrong
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes there should be a pointer too but the spirit is the same :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: mmm I don't understand
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: before sgvector getters were like
@lisitsyn	(float64_t**, int32_t&)
@iglesiasg	I understood the int32_t numweights as an int by reference
 Yanglittle	ok, now it can works, thanks very much!
@iglesiasg	ah ok I see it now
@iglesiasg	the int32_t& is to output the size of the float64_t* returned
@lisitsyn	yes

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is there any difference between berlin airports?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: better ask sonney2k
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: ^
 HeikoS	Dont know
 HeikoS	always go there by car :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where are you going to stay btw?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: dont know, probably friends
 HeikoS	or a hostel
 HeikoS	I can let you know places, but again, sonney2k probably knows the place a bit better
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: any estimate on cost of staying there?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: I never stayed in a hotel there
 HeikoS	oh yes once
@lisitsyn	heh
 HeikoS	a very nice hostel
 HeikoS	but I forgot the price ;)
 HeikoS	not too much
@lisitsyn	yay germany visa is >200$ for me
@lisitsyn	:D
 HeikoS	wow
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I should also prove I have enough money to get back :D
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha .)
 HeikoS	do you? :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I hope so!
 wiking	sonne|work: yo
 wiking	sonne|work: i have no idea why that python example fails
 wiking	lisitsyn: you need sponsors? :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: like sponsor that would take care of me?
@lisitsyn	for visa?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	for visa
 wiking	or you are going with an agency?
@lisitsyn	wiking: I am undecided - will take care of this in next few days
 wiking	lisitsyn: if u need an invitation letter let me know
@lisitsyn	wiking: but you can't invite me to germany right? :)
 wiking	i can
 wiking	i mean not to germany
 wiking	but to EU
 wiking	i mean schengen
 wiking	which is pretty much the same

@lisitsyn	wiking: I just checked - I have to have some place to stay to get visa
 wiking	i mean if u get the visa (schengen) you would be able to travel within schengen zone
@lisitsyn	yes I know
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	well i dont know if sonne|work can offer you a place
 wiking	but if that's too complicated
@lisitsyn	hah I guess no
 wiking	we can tell that you are going to stay at my place in budapest
 wiking	and that's all
 wiking	you get the visa for hungary, which is basically a visa for germany as well
 wiking	and then it should be all good
@lisitsyn	I see
 wiking	if u want one of these days i can call the russian embassy in budapest
 wiking	to ask them for most of the things...
@lisitsyn	you are helpful! thanks :)
 wiking	but maybe - if u decide to go this way - you should call the hungarian embassy in russia
 wiking	just to be sure about the papers we need to provide them
@lisitsyn	I'll reach some agency and ask them
 wiking	lisitsyn: +7-495-796-9370
@lisitsyn	wiking: where are you going to stay in berlin btw?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking isn't it easier to do all this in Germany? I mean get a place to stay there?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: Once you booked a hostel you have a place to stay
 wiking	HeikoS: hehe it's not that easy
 wiking	;)
 HeikoS	sonney2k can give you a list
 wiking	HeikoS: it's much better if he can tell to the embassy
 HeikoS	ok
 wiking	that he is staying at some persons private place
 HeikoS	well then, go ahead :)
 HeikoS	why?
 wiking	well
 wiking	because EU is an asshole
 wiking	..? :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes - but I just don't know if they provide proper papers for german visa
 wiking	and they are even more assholes with russians...? :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: haha
 HeikoS	annoying
 wiking	sorry but this is the truth
 wiking	once we had to apply for a schengen zone visa for a friend of mine
 wiking	who was from middle-east
 wiking	it was hell
 wiking	i was waiting when are they going to ask for a dna sample of my friend
@lisitsyn	hahah
 wiking	and on the end by 'their mistake' they refused to give him the visa
 wiking	...
 wiking	lisitsyn: if the hungarian embassy in russia
 wiking	can provide schengen visa
 wiking	then you are afaik much better off than germans
 wiking	just because of the history between the 2 countries
@lisitsyn	wiking: heh
@lisitsyn	yeah may be
 wiking	you know old communist comrades ;)
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	in some countries they cannot issue schengen visas
 wiking	and it's done by another embassy
 wiking	lisitsyn: so if u can please call these guys in moscow
 wiking	and ask them
@lisitsyn	wiking: HeikoS: I am asking where you are going to stay as we may book the same hotel?
 wiking	lisitsyn: i have 0 ideas yet
 wiking	i think i'm going to fix this in may some time
@lisitsyn	wiking: my plan is to check about direct -> germany thing and then compare
@lisitsyn	wiking: so you have hungarian citizenship rite?
 wiking	lisitsyn: as well, yes
@lisitsyn	wiking: you have some more? :)
 wiking	lisitsyn: yes seribna
@lisitsyn	ahh
 wiking	*serbian
 wiking	so yeah for the hungarians we can provide all stuff like: i am a 'sponsor' of your stay during your visit and that you can stay at my flat during the time your visit
 wiking	anyhow somebody has any ideas with the serialization issue on travis?
@lisitsyn	that's cool
 wiking	i saw it once failed on buildbot as well
@lisitsyn	wiking: thanks! let us consider that if germany deny me :D
 wiking	lisitsyn: okok just be on time
 wiking	lisitsyn: it does take them some fair amount of time to decide anything
@lisitsyn	yeah I should take care of that next 2 weeks or I could get out of time
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i really advise you to start it latest next week
@lisitsyn	I wanted to start early but postponed postponed postponed
 wiking	for my friend it took them ages to do anything
 wiking	and then on the end they denied
 wiking	and 1.5 week before his trip
@lisitsyn	wiking: some agencies here say they can make a german visa for 7500 roubles
 wiking	they told him that 'aaaahh we made a mistake'....
 wiking	but it was too late
 wiking	and he couldnt do the trip anymore
 wiking	lisitsyn: how much is that in usd?
@lisitsyn	divide by 30
 wiking	ohh shiiiiiit
 wiking	that's craaazy expensive
@lisitsyn	wiking: but I wouldn't have to go to moscos
@lisitsyn	moscow
 wiking	aaah otherwise you *have* to?
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah may be
 wiking	sure?
 wiking	i mean i know this friend of mine did it via mail
@lisitsyn	wiking: german embassy says they want an interview
 wiking	btw: any of these places are nearer to you than moscow: http://hungary.visahq.com/embassy/Russia/
@lisitsyn	wiking: I am just like a cluster in k-means
@lisitsyn	all of these are ~1000 km :D
 wiking	shitfuckers
 wiking	ah yeah you are in samara
 wiking	ok
 wiking	call that number i gave you
@lisitsyn	wiking: yes, toliatty currently
 wiking	just to ask them
 wiking	what are their requirements
 wiking	maybe they dont want an interview with you
@lisitsyn	wiking: alright
 wiking	lisitsyn: as far as i understood from some papers
 wiking	you as a russian citizen
 wiking	have some 'light' criterions for getting the schengen visa
@lisitsyn	yeah it must be much easier than for your friend from middle east
 wiking	heheheh
 wiking	HeikoS: ping
 HeikoS	wiking:
 wiking	HeikoS: wtf is happening in that serialization script?
 HeikoS	wiking:  which one?
 wiking	complex serialization...py
 HeikoS	wiking: dont know, did I write that?
 wiking	dunno
 HeikoS	this one keeps on failing on my local  machine
 HeikoS	sonney2k recently did some fixes for serialization
 HeikoS	haven't looked into it for a while
 wiking	btw: anybody knows what's the hard limit for a repository size on github
 wiking	?
@lisitsyn	wiking: I have seen some info where they say 1gb is soft limit
@lisitsyn	and when you reach 1gb they ask you to reduce the size
 wiking	aho

 wiking	btw we should have unit testing as well on travis i guess
 HeikoS	wiking: yes, that would be very cool!
 wiking	HeikoS: it's not complicated
 wiking	the only problem is that somehow it shoudl be done
 HeikoS	yeah as always :)
 wiking	only once
 HeikoS	I like this travis stuff
 wiking	so only for the libshogun run
 wiking	not for all the modular cases
 HeikoS	yes of course
 wiking	which makes it of course a bit more complex :P
 HeikoS	we have the modular examples, that should be fine
 HeikoS	unit tests with valgrind would also be nice :)
 wiking	HeikoS: well that's only one more package :P
 HeikoS	yeah :)
 wiking	HeikoS: what's the command for running that? :)))
 wiking	HeikoS: i know i've written it but still

 HeikoS	no idea

 HeikoS	okay
 foulwall	sonne|work: I am trying to make the code as most as reusable as I can.
 sonne|work	foulwall: I guess the three parts: getting  input / shogun learning / applying & output should be enough?
 foulwall	I wrote a base class called train&learn model
 foulwall	clustering and svr is  derived  from the train&learn
 foulwall	but the split up is not easy to do. I'm trying to find a general method.

 wiking	btw i might need to test as well liblinear + HKM :P
@lisitsyn	it depends of course but I'd expect svmlight could be faster

 sonne|work	wiking: it really depends... in my experience if you have lots of data from one class and not so much from the other svmlight is faster
 wiking	sonne|work: it's kind of like equaly distributed
 sonne|work	svm light better benefits multiple cores
 sonne|work	but otherwise libsvm might be a bit faster
 sonne|work	maybe more stable too
 deerishi	HeikoS: u told me to implement a scik it example on KPCA,could you guide me a bit on how to go about it.i have been trying the shogun KPCA library,but so far did not get anything good
 HeikoS	deerishi: hi!
 HeikoS	deerishi: what I meant is just to use the data in the scikit learn and produce similar looking plots
 HeikoS	using shogun's KPCA implementation
 HeikoS	your code is fine
 HeikoS	but I would use a different example
 HeikoS	the scikit example is very nice since it illustrates the method very nicely
 deerishi	just one quick question : shogun's does explicitly gives back the modified data KPCA ?the code i wrote gave back the densities of the data on a line
 deerishi	ohh.i think i have an idea,will try it out and let you know
 deerishi	HeikoS:thanks
 HeikoS	deerishi: no
 HeikoS	it gives you a  matrix
 HeikoS	which is DxN where D are the number of eigevectors you use
 HeikoS	you just have to plot carefully
 HeikoS	pairs of points
 HeikoS	deerishi: you should be almost there! :)
 deerishi	i hv an idea,will work on it tonight.thanks!!

 wiking	lisitsyn: svmsgd seems to be cool ;)
 wiking	i mean much faster for my dataset :P
 sonne|work	wiking: well it just does x passes over the data
 sonne|work	so no wonder
 wiking	mmmm but unfortunately all the options
 wiking	are way worse than random forest :(
 wiking	i guess we dont have random forest, yet :P
 wiking	woah
 wiking	pnorm preprocessor segfaults
 sonne|work	thoralf: better chat in the channel :)
 sonne|work	yeah I know I did write the hashing stuff in shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: backtrace?
 sonne|work	hard to believe since it is so simple
 wiking	doh
 wiking	something is really weird
 wiking	i have an SGMatrix
 wiking	and with memcpy i fill it up
 wiking	and right away after memcpy i can even print out the right values
 wiking	but then when i do on the whole matrix
 wiking	a display_matrix()
 wiking	it's a full 0 matrix
 wiking	i mean the output
 wiking	any ideas?
-!- sids_aquarius [~sidi_@li400-124.members.linode.com] has joined #shogun
 wiking	ok seem display_matrix is aint working
 sonne|work	huh?
 sonne|work	I used that and it worked
 wiking	coz it perfectly works if i put that matrix into a densefeatures class and then do a 1-by-1 feats->get_feature_vector(i); display_vector()
 wiking	but if i just do a display_matrix it's like as if the matrix is a big 0
 sonne|work	wiking: please put some test code somewhere in a github issue and mark it entrance...
 wiking	sonne|work: ok will do
 vgorbati	hi all, I am a student wisihing to participate in GSoC 2013. To get familiar with shogun I have forked, cloned the shogun-git workspace and compiled it. To continue, I want to try working on the issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/968. Can anyone talk with me about it?
 wiking	now more the question is
 wiking	that why pnorm dies
 wiking	:)
 wiking	sonne|work: it works fine with a small SGMatrix
 wiking	and it dies with a big one
 sonne|work	big == ?
 wiking	380000x18
 wiking	on a 19*18
 wiking	it works fine
 thoralf	sonne: Yes, I was wondering... since your name appears in the copyright notice of all the hashing kernels. ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: hahaha i think i know why, although not 100%
 wiking	sonne|work: u reckon this could happen when i apply PNorm (which works with fixed float64_t) on a DenseFeatures<float32_t> ?
 wiking	i mean memory access problems
 wiking	imo PNorm should be templated as well

 thoralf	I am trying to process text data with shogun, but the examples I found only deal with DNA data, producing one feature per CHAR.
 thoralf	Can anyone give a pointer to a piece of code with WORD features? :)
 thoralf	The class StringWordFeatures pretends to be the right one, but I did not find out how to use it.
 thoralf	(The class name within the python bindings.)

 sonne|work	the word in there just denotes 2 bytes
 thoralf	sonne: Thanks - at least I don't need to search any more.
 thoralf	sonne: A preprocessing using NLTK wouldn't be hard, so I think this might be the way to go.

 foulwall	Hello dudes.
 wiking	sonne|work: the only thing is that in this case i cannot get SG_ADD working
 sonne|work	foulwall: hello
 sonne|work	thoralf: yes indeed but I guess there is no way around this
 foulwall	sonney2k: I've pulled a request. check it pls. I'm wondering the reliability of the code.
 sonne|work	wiking: why do you need the templated thing?
 wiking	sonne|work: well this is the thing
 wiking	sonne|work: i've got segfault
 wiking	sonne|work: when i applied the current PNorm on a DenseFeatures<float32_t>
 wiking	sonne|work: since of course sizeof(float32_t) < sizeof(float64_t)
 wiking	sonne|work: of course the best would be that the user doesn't have to give
 wiking	the PNorm<T>
 wiking	as it should be known where it's applied
 wiking	i mean the T type in the Features
 wiking	right?
 wiking	so this should be somehow detected runtime :P
 sonne|work	foulwall: looks much more readable now
@lisitsyn	why do we need templated features/preprocessors/etc exposed to the interfaces?
 wiking	lisitsyn: any idea how to solve this in case of PNorm?
 foulwall	sonne|work: I'm looking for a way to hide the related but not public method in the class.
@lisitsyn	wiking: no - I am ok with that change but we are going bad
 sonne|work	wiking: it is quite weird already that you were able to attach this processor to your float32_t data
 sonne|work	there should be a check in there
 wiking	lisitsyn: indeed
 thoralf	sonne: Mapping all text features (unigrams, n-grams) to numbers and storing them in sparse feature files would be a good start.
@lisitsyn	wiking: have you seen my crazy ideas on API?
 sonne|work	foulwall: my suggestion would be to split up the file - I mean the svr and clustering class could be in some other class or so
 foulwall	Oh, I see.
 thoralf	sonne: Since you probably want to implement all this text-processing-stuff (like stopword removal, stemming) in shogun, this could easily be outsourced to existing tools.
 foulwall	I'm fixing that.
 sonne|work	thoralf: but then what would you need shogun for?
 sonne|work	I mean computing a hash is what you could outsource too
 thoralf	sonne: MKL, Hashing?
 thoralf	sonne: Yes and no: When outsourcing the hash, you don't hav influence to the hashing function any more.
 thoralf	while learning.
 sonne|work	computing hash on n-grams is easy to do in C++ at least
 thoralf	Ack.
 sonne|work	computing hashes on words (with some stop tokens) too
 sonne|work	stopword removal / stemming is a different story
 sonne|work	foulwall: remove the old pull request then and create just one pull request with the split up code
 foulwall	sonne|work: ok.
 sonne|work	wiking: look at shogun/features/DenseFeatures.cpp - it uses SG_ADD
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: we indeed mostly only have preprocessors for double/float
 sonne|work	wiking: I would suggest to have this p-norm preproc just for double & float
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I tend to think we should get rid of templates here
@lisitsyn	it is not possible to get rid of them at all but they should go deeper
@lisitsyn	like in policy-based design (scnr)

 wiking	../shogun/base/SGObject.h:67:4: note: expanded from macro 'SG_ADD'
 wiking	                        m_model_selection_parameters->add(param, name, description);\
 wiking	using SG_ADD
 wiking	sonne|work: if i don't define template class CPNorm<bool>; etc.
 wiking	sonne|work: linker starts to cry that it cannot find
 wiking	the reference on those
 wiking	and for some reaseon they are referenced from class_list.cpp.o
 wiking	any magic tricks to to avoid this error?
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah you are deriving from a templated class
 sonne|work	it is a massacre
 sonne|work	so just create another PNorm preproc for floats
 sonne|work	and relax
 wiking	sonne|work: hahhahaha
 wiking	sonne|work: or have a PNorm preproc now for all?
 sonne|work	otherwise IIRC you have to specify which type of the base class you are referring to
 wiking	because that's pretty fast
 wiking	i mean implementation wise
 wiking	as it's already ready on my machine
 wiking	anyways i have this
 wiking	in init
 wiking	ASSERT(features->get_feature_class()==C_DENSE) ASSERT(features->get_feature_type()==F_DREAL)
 wiking	so it won't run on any other type of features
 wiking	just floats
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	double
 sonne|work	!
 wiking	float and double yeah
 wiking	the only question now is that why's that error for SG_ADD
 wiking	ok it's funny if i specify like this the function: template <class ST> void CPNorm<ST>::register_param ()
 wiking	i mean template <> void CPNorm<float32_t>::register_param ()
 wiking	then it works but of course it'll cry that for the other possible template paramaters this function (register_param) does not exist
 wiking	but at least it doesn't cry for not having m_parameters and m_model_selection_parameters variables
 wiking	i have to leave if you guys have a sane soluation for this problem please write it here i'll read the logs and then commit this fix
 sonne|work	wiking: yes as I said it needs the actual type
 wiking	sonne|work: so i should put there by hand all the type? :)
 wiking	ok i see
 sonne|work	so it will work in the specialization
 wiking	will do when i'm online again
 wiking	bbl
 sonne|work	that is why I dont' like deriving templated classes from templated classes

 wiking	iglesiasg: i'm trying to do binary classification on a quite simple dataset
 wiking	but for some reason weka beats by a big margin any shogun classifier until now
@iglesiasg	wiking: mmm not good
 wiking	mmm we don't have a possibility to standardize a dataset right?
@lisitsyn	wiking: PruneVarSubMean
@sonney2k	wiking, what do I hear weka works better?
@sonney2k	what does that mean?
@iglesiasg	this is a sad day for all of us :(
@lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	haha
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, it is user error
@iglesiasg	haha
@sonney2k	no idea what wiking does but I am pretty sure that this is not a shogun bug
@sonney2k	training with poly kernel needs a couple of tweaks to get the data behave well
@sonney2k	the svm I mean
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what are the tricks?
@sonney2k	there a lots of factors like kernel normalizer, or features normalization or inhomogeneous poly kernel or homogeneous...
@sonney2k	everything can make a big difference
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: use weka *lol*
@sonney2k	depending on the data
@sonney2k	that weka trains a lot faster indicates that the data is better normalized
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i'm trying with different normalization
 wiking	kernel and simple norm of the vectors
@sonney2k	wiking, why do you use poly kernel?
@sonney2k	why not gaussian?
 wiking	sonney2k: well i've tried different
 wiking	until now this is the best
@sonney2k	gaussian is much easier to get good results with
@sonney2k	wiking, just to understand - which parameters did you use for poly kernel?
 wiking	sonney2k: for polykernel itself i used the same cache size and degree as in weka
 wiking	degree only 1
@sonney2k	wiking, linear kernel?
@lisitsyn	wait
@lisitsyn	degree =1?
@sonney2k	you mean with linear kernel you get good results?
@sonney2k	why don't you use liblinear / svmocas then?
@sonney2k	wiking, which kernel normalizer?
 wiking	sonney2k: not even near
 wiking	sonney2k: sqrtdiag
@lisitsyn	wiking: what is the difference between linear and poly d=1?
@sonney2k	for linear it doesn't make much sense
@sonney2k	to put things on a hypersphere
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, normalization
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ahh
@sonney2k	otherwise nothing
@lisitsyn	but I wouldn't go for that just because of normalization
@sonney2k	wiking, do not compare accuracy - compare with something bias independent
@sonney2k	like area under ROC curve
 wiking	sonney2k: lemme check
@sonney2k	bias is very very sensitive
@sonney2k	(might be...)
@sonney2k	better plot both ROC curves even
 wiking	what is the the macro?
* sonney2k leaving train
 wiking	in contingencytable?
@sonney2k	back in a few mins
@lisitsyn	wiking: ROCEvaluation
@lisitsyn	use it
 wiking	ah lol
 wiking	lol [ERROR] assertion m_current_values.vector && idx<get_num_labels() failed in file labels/Labels.cpp line 57
 wiking	i wonder what's happening
@lisitsyn	wiking: what did you do?
 wiking	just added CROCEvaluation roc; roc.evaluate(pred, gt);
@lisitsyn	wiking: debug please :D
@sonney2k	wiking, seems like your labels & predictions don't have the same size
 wiking	i wonder why dont we have such assert in contingencytable :S
@lisitsyn	wiking: I am not sure it is the reason - did you check call stack?
 wiking	not yet

@sonney2k	wiking, so did you check now?

@lisitsyn	sonney2k: different lights in west/east berlin - really?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you know the east :)
@sonney2k	we can be lucky to even have electricity here
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: hah why?
