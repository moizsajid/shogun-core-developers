 bb_	besser82 still stuck at the hdf5 issue and not being able to install on ubuntu
 bb_	besser82 this is the error http://pastebin.com/TsmpHKXg
 besser82	bb_:  Could you please start compilation from a clean build-dir and use cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON and paste me the full build-procedure, please?
 bb_	besser82 sure doing this now
 besser82	bb_: thanks a lot!  Having a verbose build makes tracing the problems much easier  ;)
 bb_	besser82 beenish@beenishU:~/shogun-3.0.0/build$ sudo cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON CMake Error: The source directory "/home/beenish/shogun-3.0.0/build" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt. Specify --help for usage, or press the help button on the CMake GUI.
 besser82	bb_: you forgot to append some `..`  :-P
 bb_	besser82 here is the output of cmake http://pastebin.com/aMt4Zxud
 besser82	bb_: did you already start the compilation?!?
 bb_	besser82 yes
 bb_	besser82 do you want anything specific from me or abort
 besser82	bb_: the output from the linker stage of libshogun would be the most important...

 besser82	bb_: looks like hdf5 doesn't get passed to the linker flags...
 besser82	bb_: try this:
 besser82	bb_: export LDFLAGS="/usr/lib/libhdf5.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so"
 besser82	bb_: and do same i told you above afterwards, but DON'T use that sudo; it's needed for make install only  ;)
 bb_	besser82 just in the build direcotre
 besser82	bb_: yes just in build-tree  ;)

 besser82	HeikoS:  HEY!!!!!!
@HeikoS	besser82: hi! :)
 besser82	HeikoS: Wasup?!?  How are studies going?
@HeikoS	besser82: just got back from NIPS
@HeikoS	now trying to not fall asleep
 besser82	HeikoS: some CafPow may help, for sure  ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: I dont know wheather that confuses the body not even more
@HeikoS	but yeah for sure will do that ;)
@HeikoS	just sent another controversial mail to the list :)
 besser82	HeikoS: Lemme see...  ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: Nuthing there, yet :(
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.200.185.80] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	besser82: should be
@HeikoS	cced you
 besser82	HeikoS: you actually started a religous discussion about  ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: the main problem is some stuff we link against
 besser82	HeikoS: you may NOT link BSD-code against GPL'ed code  ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: That actually is a copyright-infringement  :(
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah I know, just a discussion and a suggestion
 besser82	HeikoS: the other problem is:  Many companies aviod GPL'ed code, because then they can't hide the fact they stole 99% to put together their brand-new shit-based oriented solution (tm)  :-P
@HeikoS	besser82: so what software does shogun link against that is GPL?
@HeikoS	maybe we can do a GPL and BSD version
 besser82	HeikoS: lemme look
@HeikoS	where the GPL stuff is excluded via some preprocessing magic
@HeikoS	besser82: you recently checked all libs right?
@HeikoS	I know I took some parts of ALGLIB which are GPL
@HeikoS	and some stuff of vojtech is GPL, but s?ren knows him
@HeikoS	etc etc
 besser82	HeikoS: not yet, but there are some for sure...
@HeikoS	besser82:  and main thing: I dont want to be religious but just pragmatic
@HeikoS	and this would definitely increase our impact, at least it does not decrease it
 besser82	HeikoS: The question is do we (and mostly S?ren) want Shogun to be shipped in some $$$-shit without getting credit?!?
 besser82	HeikoS: That's the main problem with BSD / MIT style licenses....
@HeikoS	besser82: thats what I want to discuss
@HeikoS	s?ren told me last time: it is too late
@HeikoS	so lets see
 besser82	HeikoS: kk  ;)
@HeikoS	the full python environment is bsd btw
@HeikoS	scikit learn and all those
@HeikoS	ipython
 bb_	bessser82 it is still giving the same error
@HeikoS	and they still get support from $$$
 besser82	bb_: linker stage output?!?
 besser82	HeikoS: ColPack, e.g. is LGPL, not compat with BSD
 bb_	besser82 http://pastebin.com/2Y77cjRr
 besser82	HeikoS: glpk is GPLv3+, too
 bb_	besser82 did not compile ith with verbose
@HeikoS	besser82: what do you think about this modular approach of having a BSD core and some GPL extensions?
@HeikoS	colpack is only used for a single algorithm
@HeikoS	things like eigen3 and lapack are fine
 besser82	HeikoS: a bsd core with GPL'ed plugins / extension might be a solution...
@HeikoS	besser82: then the challenge is to ask most of the authors
 besser82	HeikoS: although LGPL would be somehow better thant BSD
@HeikoS	besser82: I actually would prefer a "do what you like" license
@HeikoS	not put any stones in the way
@HeikoS	I want people to use my stuff
@HeikoS	but anyway, lets see what the others say
 besser82	HeikoS: LGPL is a do what you like license, mainly....
 besser82	HeikoS: It doesn't imply any inheritage of license like GPL would do...
 besser82	bb_: please recompile with verbose and WITHOUT using sudo...
 bb_	besser82 okay
 bb_	besser82 verbose without sudo http://pastebin.com/KQTca8r2
 besser82	bb_: strange which version of ubuntu you are using?!?
 bb_	besser82 Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS
 besser82	bb_: lemme setup a vm and try to reproduce, please be patient...
 bb_	besser82 sure
 bb_	besser82 what do you think is the issue
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.200.185.80] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 besser82	bb_: not sure,  my current suspect is the version of hdf5 being used....
 bb_	besser82 okay
 besser82	bb_: but as i said not completely sure...  need to do some deeper investigation on that...
 bb_	besser82 will wait, who is the expert regarding installation of shogun on osx... that installation crashed at the very beginning
 besser82	bb_: try sonney2k or wiking.  They do have a mac...
 besser82	bb_: i'm actually the Linux hacker ;)  Mainly Fedora && RedHat
 bb_	besser82 thats good. i am just a basic user of linux and mac
 bb_	besser82 shouldn't ubuntu behave very much similar to fedora and redhat
 besser82	bb_: in it's basics, yes  ;)
 besser82	bb_: but not by the means of binary-compat and such  ;)
 besser82	bb_: installing ubuntu is so damn slow  :(
 besser82	bb: btw. why are you using ubuntu?!?  There is much better alternatives ;)
 besser82	bb_: btw. why are you using ubuntu?!?  There is much better alternatives ;)
 bb_	besser82 i am little use to it with my little experience plus when i used shogun couple of years ago that was the easiest platform to install on
 besser82	bb_: i see
 besser82	bb_: Try out Fedora  ;)
 bb_	besser82 what are the alternatives
 besser82	bb_: Much better from usability && user-expirience compared to ubuntu  ;)
 bb_	besser82 i was fedora user before i switched to ubuntu
 besser82	bb_: How long ago?!?
 besser82	bb_: Within the last 1.5 years there has been much improvements to Fedora ;)
 bb_	besser82 6-7 years
 besser82	bb_: That says all  ;)  Fedora was something very hard to use back then  ;)
 besser82	bb_: recent fedora performs out all other desktop-linux by means of simplicity and expirience  ;)
 bb_	besser82 does shogun install well on fedora
 besser82	bb_: I'm currently preparing an rpm for fedora  ;)  So you can install from packages  ;)
 besser82	bb_: no need to self build  ;)
 besser82	bb_: and yes it works quite out of the box  ;)
 besser82	bb_: even if you build yourself
 besser82	bb_: ... brb ... 10 minutes
 bb_	besser82 okay which version of fedora are you using
 besser82	bb_: I'm on Fedora 20 pre-release
 besser82	bb_: Relase will be 17th Dec
 besser82	bb_: but I can give you some download url;  just a minute...
 besser82	bb_: http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease
 besser82	bb_: Pretty stable, no real issues in there
 bb_	besser82
 bb_	lets see if i have the time i will try it again one day
 besser82	bb_: +1  :D
 bb_	besser82 are fedore and ubunut still competing i thought ubuntu had won that battle
 besser82	bb_: not really  :(  It's far to commecial  ;)
 besser82	bb_: And yes, Fedora folks are still working on being #1  :-P
 besser82	bb_: like me  ;)  ---> https://badges.fedoraproject.org/leaderboard
 bb_	besser82 oh good now i get it i better stick with ubunut
 bb_	besser82 lol
 besser82	bb_: Just can trust me.  I'm totally unbiased  :-P
 besser82	bb_: I don't want to say other distros are bad...
 besser82	bb_: but Canonical actually doesn't make Ubuntu a good community and all...
 besser82	bb_: In fact Cannonical isn't even interessted in community  :(
 bb_	besser82 to you minute differences matter, when i was on fedore i had some network issues and had to restart it everytime from the command line and would freeze

 besser82	lisitsyn: * LOL *
 besser82	lisitsyn: To be honest: I'm a one-man-band-freelancer and need this skill to survive  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I wonder what do you do exactly
 lisitsyn	I mean what is that you are paid for :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: Risk-analysis for individual Insurance-contracts...
 lisitsyn	for example I sit in the office and pretend I code
 besser82	lisitsyn: in cases like: JLo want an insurance for her bum-bum, I come into play  ;)
 lisitsyn	hmm interesting
 lisitsyn	so you estimate what is the risk JLo loses her ass
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes, some like that
 lisitsyn	but how do you manage to do that as a freelancer?
 lisitsyn	I was sure it is matter of big insurance companies
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: you should work for Shogun! :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: no money no honey :D :D
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: then help on getting some :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes, but they need someone who has the information and stuff...
 besser82	lisitsyn: so, I'm selling this as-a-service
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm mining data, use it and sell the result, not the data  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: uh I see, interesting
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: how?
 lisitsyn	besser82: is that just common cases or you handle some interesting stuff?
 lisitsyn	I mean don't they have anything for routine insurance
 besser82	lisitsyn: only extra-ordinary stuff
 besser82	lisitsyn: routine stuff they handle thier selves
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm just called for special things
 lisitsyn	besser82: lala I just called to say I love you
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn: but they pay da godd $$$  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: so you are kind of rich man? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: Let's say so: I can afford to eat meat every day  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: what can say better is that you have your own real estate
 lisitsyn	if you do oh la la I see :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: I do  ;)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: help gunnar to justify to give us money, make Shogun core BSD to be able to ask companies for collaborations/support, blablabla!
 besser82	lisitsyn: find some girls, tell them they'll be models and pimp them  :-P
 lisitsyn	hahah that's the plan B
 besser82	lisitsyn: * rofl *
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: however besser82's suggestion looks a bit better
 lisitsyn	how do you beat it?
 HeikoS1	 lisitsyn, whatever you think helps ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: oh I know who is from amazon berlin :)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn:  I met about 10 people who work there last week
 HeikoS1	even some of the institute I am currently at went there after phd
 HeikoS1	the guy was called andreas m?ller
 HeikoS1	scikit learn coder
 lisitsyn	yes I talked to him a few times
 HeikoS1	nice guy
 lisitsyn	he is like the main guy there
 HeikoS1	we should talk to them more
 HeikoS1	there is lots to learn from each other
 HeikoS1	they have some really nice ideas that we could borrow and vice versa
 besser82	bb_: there is really some trouble with your installation  :(
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I would be much better to avoid spending our lives to do the same thing somehow
 lisitsyn	no idea what's the way around that
 besser82	bb_: I CANNOT reproduce your problem on a fresh install && updated ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS...
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn:  I know, but diversity is also good
 HeikoS1	no way to unify
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: we could talk to naywhayare to join us though ;)
 HeikoS1	he is very close to what we are doing
 bb_	besser82 this was fresh vm i installed a month
 lisitsyn	I think he believes our codebase is sick in bad meaning of that word :D
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: well he is correct
 besser82	bb_: Just build successfull on freshly installed vm  ;)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: still the re-write word is in my head, although I dont really believe in that
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: but if we could modularise things more, it is easier to replace things
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah I am damn crazy about that stuff too
 HeikoS1	like parameter framework
 HeikoS1	thats a nice start
 HeikoS1	you could go ahead with that
 lisitsyn	I am having troubles with time :D
 HeikoS1	would be happy to join and try to integrate that into shogun
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: I know that
 HeikoS1	but will be better for me soon
 lisitsyn	not really time though
 HeikoS1	after jan
 lisitsyn	I am having troubles with like being overwhelmed
 lisitsyn	sometimes I do have time but I am emotionally dead
 bb_	besser82 so does it install cleanly with out any issues
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: change job, come to europe ! :)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: ah speaking of having no time, I got to do some reading
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I will consider some cases once I get my msc
 HeikoS1	way behind stuff due to last week
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: yeah totally do :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: in minimal case I change city
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: yeah!
 lisitsyn	in maximal change country :D

 bb_	besser82 that is strange did you have  to install all the libraries that shogun requires after you installed ubuntu
 lisitsyn	besser82: I should consider some job that is not that usual as programmer :D

 lisitsyn	software engineering is boring stuff

 lisitsyn	I wish I built aircrafts
 lisitsyn	or may be feed polar bears

 besser82	bb_: I actually installed all libs from ubuntu repos, but eigen3
 besser82	bb_: and appended `-DBUNDLE_EIGEN=ON` to cmake-cmd
 besser82	bb_: because eigen3 from repos is way too old

 lisitsyn	good advice
 besser82	lisitsyn: you just need to find connection  to the right people...
 besser82	lisitsyn: and everything will go instant :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: and learn some entprise marketing skills  :-P
 lisitsyn	haha way too much already
 besser82	lisitsyn: three little steps, actually, like with agent oso  :-P
 bb_	besser82 okay do you all the libraries from cmake and just the 4 missing are mosek, arprec, colpack and cplex
 besser82	bb_: yes, all libs, but the named ones
 bb_	besser82 that is strange
 besser82	bb_: and all runs smooth
 besser82	bb_: at least on my vm, which may detect it's running on a Fedora host and therefore uses the-no-errors-possible mode  :-P
 besser82	bb_: dumb joke, I know :(
 bb_	besser82 haha i dont know what is the issue should i try new ubuntu as i need to do a fresh install anyways
 besser82	bb_: either newer ubuntu or try Fedora in the vm  ;(
 besser82	bb_: For fedora I can supply you with will-work-for-sure prebuild rpms
 bb_	besser82 that is a lot of investment new fedora
 besser82	bb_: reinstall is reinstall, isn't it?
 bb_	besser82 all i want is shogun to work properly
 besser82	bb_: Use Fedora and I have proven to work rpms  ;)
 besser82	bb_: which version of fedora is no matter you can take F18+
 besser82	bb_: with ubuntu i could try to get it working on 13.10 or such
 bb_	besser82 what about osx if i can get shogun working on it i dont need vm at all
 besser82	bb_: and give you pre-build binaries, hopefully
 besser82	bb_: I really have no idea how to get that working on OSX...
 besser82	bb_: The only ones who may help you with OSX are sonney2k or wiking
 besser82	sonney2k: Are you there?!? ^^
 bb_	besser82 how many sonne's are there
 besser82	bb_: sonney2k, sonne|osx, sonne|work --> all the same  ;)
 besser82	bb_: If can catch sonne on irc, you can write him a email: sonne@debian.org
 bb_	besser82 okay wiking said he can install yesterday
 besser82	bb_: read it... but I cannot confirm nor deny
 besser82	bb_: I'm on Linux, only
 besser82	bb_: Nor do I own any product with a bitten fruit
 bb_	besser82 what should i read.....
 besser82	bb_: not you  :)  I read it.  sry for confusion
 bb_	besser82 what if we disable hdf5 while cmake as iglesias had suggested
 bb_	besser82 will it compile then
 besser82	bb_: then a f*cking bunch of fetaures will not be avail  :(
 besser82	bb_: and I'm not sure whether hdf5 is needed for your use-case....
 bb_	besser82 like what kind i am thinking whether i need them
 besser82	bb_: I dunno exactly, actually i didn't write any code of shogun
 bb_	besser82  as i told you earlier i would like it to work natively on mac if not for the time being i can go without those features
 bb_	besser82 can you help in compiling wihout those features
 besser82	bb_: one thing that sparks my mind....
 besser82	bb_: which version of hdf5 you installed on ubuntu vm?
 bb_	besser82 how to check for it
 besser82	bb_: try `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev`
 besser82	bb_: that should install the version i used
 besser82	bb_: I actually don't know how to search for installed pkgs on ubuntu...
 bb_	besser82 sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev [sudo] password for beenish:  Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done libhdf5-serial-dev is already the newest version. 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 18 not upgraded.
 bb_	besser82 it is the same version and says the newest version
 besser82	bb_: 18 pkgs not upgraded?!?
 besser82	bb_: sudo yum upgrade
 besser82	bb_: sudo apt-get upgrade
 bb_	besser82 all it means is hdf5 library is the current version and you dont need to to anything
 besser82	bb_: but there might be some other pkg which are never on my vm which get interfaced by shogun, possibly...
 besser82	bb_: I want to purge all possible errors
 bb_	besser82 i can remove and reinstall hdf5 library
 besser82	bb_: might help and don't forget update the other pkgs
 bb_	besser82 it is able to see the hdf5 library but not able to find the functions..
 bb_	besser82 that is not typical
 besser82	bb_: yes, but the reason is why?!?
 besser82	bb_: do you use a custom $ENV or such, like LD_PATH or so?
 bb_	besser82 where
 besser82	bb_: in your shell environment
 bb_	besser82 no may be you hdf5 which are openmpi capable like https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/libhdf5-openmpi-dev/
 bb_	besser82 as the gcc compiler is openmpi capable
 besser82	bb_: no, my vm has the serial-ver installed
 besser82	bb_: the openmpi-version is sth very different from compilers openmp feature
 bb_	besser82 is openmpi package installed in your vm
 besser82	bb_: no
 besser82	bb_: openmpi != openmp-from-gcc
 bb_	it is on my vm
 besser82	bb_: but that shouldn't give interferrence, otherwise that is a bug in ubuntu...
 bb_	besser82 see this http://pastebin.com/Dye6RDLm
 bb_	besser82 does you hdf5 installation give this kind or mesage
 besser82	bb_: no, but i guess your install / vm is broken then  :(  Not a problem with shogun...
 besser82	bb_: which doesn't mean i want to help  :D
 besser82	bb_: s/to help$/no &/
 bb_	besser82 what is that

 besser82	bb_: What? that s///
 besser82	bb_: a regex
 lisitsyn	besser82: speak people english or deutsch not regexpressions :D
 besser82	bb_: it actually told you to insert a "not" before the "to help" in my previous sentence
 besser82	lisitsyn: regex actually should be worldlanguage  ;)
 bb_	besser82 with that command what are we trying to see
 lisitsyn	besser82: how hello you are
 lisitsyn	besser82: reorder words to obtain correct sentence please
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn: may I use that awk ?
 besser82	bb_: the output of you paste?
 lisitsyn	besser82: stimmt
 lisitsyn	no idea if that's correct
 lisitsyn	my mind says that word fits there
 besser82	lisitsyn: stimmt would be a positive answer for some statement, like "I agree" or "right"  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: das stimmt?
 besser82	lisitsyn: "Ja" would fit better here  ;)
 lisitsyn	haha okay
 besser82	lisitsyn: "das stimmt" would fall in cases of my first explaination  ;)
 besser82	bb_: your paste tells me there is some trouble with the ownerships and / or permissions of the basic-folders of your system...
 besser82	bb_: but unfortunately not which and why  :(
 bb_	besser82 i am the owner of the this computer and all the folders inside it lol
 lisitsyn	I AM DA BOSS OBEY
 besser82	bb_: actually I meant from the system's pov  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: You might be superman (tm), but i got that kryptonite(tm)  ;-P
 besser82	sonney2k: We can haz #shogun-social channel for such stuff, plz?!?
 besser82	sonney2k: I mean that OT chit-chat...
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha
 besser82	lisitsyn: let get it back serious...
 besser82	lisitsyn: You want to make some serious $$$?
 lisitsyn	besser82: am I looking crazy to NOT want $$$? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: You always complain about stuff being too enterprise  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: hah well yes enterprise software is like bad software you know
 besser82	lisitsyn: +1  :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: but RedHat  ;)  They do it the right way(tm)
 lisitsyn	haha except their website
 besser82	lisitsyn: everywhere is something to so good  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn: I have some thoughts about Forex...
 besser82	lisitsyn: There is lots of Binary brokers around....
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have some forex experience
 lisitsyn	as like 'player' haha
 besser82	lisitsyn: +1
 besser82	lisitsyn: :-P
 lisitsyn	I'd say it is some game when you do that with emotions
 besser82	lisitsyn: How about trying to predict forex movements?!?
 besser82	lisitsyn: like USD/EUR will be 1.2345 in ~15 Minutes or such?
 besser82	lisitsyn: and writing some GPL'ed app to do that prediction
 lisitsyn	besser82: well it is not that easy
 besser82	lisitsyn: c'mon SHOGUN::predict_forex_movement("USD/EUR", "15 Minutes")  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: if that was that easy.. I'd get rich :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: Me, too
 besser82	lisitsyn: but unfortunately i'm just half-rich...
 lisitsyn	haha I am rather poor then
 besser82	lisitsyn: I wanted to be a millie with 30
 besser82	lisitsyn: but then the EUR came and made all 1/2
 lisitsyn	besser82: I have 7 more years to make your dream come true (but for me) :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: that sounds great!
 besser82	lisitsyn: that sounds great!
 besser82	lisitsyn: So how do we want to get it done?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well become a gangster
 besser82	lisitsyn: Youre connected?!?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Or do we need to aquire the proper people first?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Let's get it sane...
 besser82	lisitsyn: Would like to work on such?
 besser82	lisitsyn: an app to milk-off all binary-brokers...
 lisitsyn	besser82: well
 lisitsyn	IDK ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I do have good tick-data
 besser82	lisitsyn: from ~2007 to present
 lisitsyn	it doesn't work
 lisitsyn	patterns evolve
 lisitsyn	signals worked before don't work now
 besser82	lisitsyn: We have enough sources to train evolving patterns
 lisitsyn	AFAIK
 besser82	lisitsyn: partially true...
 besser82	lisitsyn: We just need 70% positive predicton
 lisitsyn	well yes
 lisitsyn	but that's already dead hard problem :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: c'mon  we can doooooooooooooooo it!
 lisitsyn	no I don't mind to try just takes time
 besser82	lisitsyn: So I'm alone with that, I suppose....
 lisitsyn	besser82: not really, I don't mind ;) and wiking wanted to go finance
 lisitsyn	it sounds like easiest way haha
 besser82	lisitsyn: which is the easiest way?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: get money from the field related to money
 besser82	lisitsyn: as i am talking...
 besser82	lisitsyn: we need an app to milk those bin brokers...
 besser82	lisitsyn: the easiest way (tm)
 lisitsyn	besser82: one should know the trick to milk them
 lisitsyn	:)
 besser82	lisitsyn: predict forex prices
 lisitsyn	everybody does that right?
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure  :D
 lisitsyn	how do you beat them? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: asking you to help with developing an app  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: easy if you have idea ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: we just need to classify the tick ffrom past...

 lisitsyn	sounds oversimplified
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	X -> Y
 besser82	lisitsyn: look for matching in current ticks
 besser82	lisitsyn: and classify those, find simlar patterns in past and look what happened there
 besser82	lisitsyn: that needs to be done for all pair influencing oneanother and *BOOM*
 besser82	lisitsyn: we shoud be rich
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's like millions of people worked already right? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: not exactly..
 besser82	lisitsyn: they didn't mind the influence of other pairs and such
 lisitsyn	well how many guys already tried to apply ML (you speak about multitask learning I guess)
 besser82	lisitsyn: not so much i guess
 besser82	lisitsyn: Which usual-guy(tm) has knowledge about that ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: we just need some network for training the evolving patterns and such...
 besser82	lisitsyn: make classifaction of current evolvement and try to find some closest matches of past
 besser82	lisitsyn: r u still there?
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 besser82	lisitsyn: i'm trying to sell you some idea  :-P
 lisitsyn	hahaha
 lisitsyn	I have no money to buy it haha
 besser82	lisitsyn: need no money
 lisitsyn	just kidding ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: just need some guys helping with that
 besser82	lisitsyn: with that thing we can rule the world  ;)
 lisitsyn	I am quite sceptic ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: money, fat-ass tv, girls
 besser82	lisitsyn: You don't want that?
 lisitsyn	haha
 besser82	lisitsyn: buying Microsoft and retire Wincrap...
 lisitsyn	no that's not the thing - I just know it is dangerous to treat people in field X as idiots
 lisitsyn	because once you get into you realize you are getting there too
 besser82	lisitsyn: c'mon! What would convince you?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well no need to convince

 bb	besser82 can we install shogun without hdf5
 bb	besser82 that would be the best for now
 besser82	bb: lemme check...
@wiking	bb ping
 bb	@wiking
@wiking	bb: what i really dont get is why you cannot compile as it really works for me
@wiking	bb: but then again i've realised
@wiking	bb: if u use 10.9 and try to use shogun 3.0.0 you'll have problems with libc++ being the default for llvm
@wiking	bb: so i suggest u to try to check out the develop branch of the shogun repository
@wiking	and that should really work for you
@wiking	bb: i use macports libraries with shogun w/o any particular problems
@wiking	bb: and i really compile every week at least twice shogun on my osx
 bb	@wiking okay when you say developer version how do i get that
@wiking	bb: git clone https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 bb	@wiking okay i am try that now
 bb	@wiking this is the error i get http://pastebin.com/Vpy318Mm
 bb	@wiking when i compile do you want to look at the output of cmake
 bb	@wiking here is the output http://pastebin.com/fZhUYV28
@wiking	WTF is with your system ?!
@wiking	why does it try to find pthread_spinlock_t?!
 bb	@wiking can we do something to fix it
@wiking	-- Looking for C++ include unordered_map - not found
@wiking	this is weird
@wiking	bb: what's the output for uname -a
@wiking	?
@wiking	Darwin welitron.local 13.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.0.0: Thu Sep 19 22:22:27 PDT 2013; root:xnu-2422.1.72~6/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
@wiking	for me

 bb	@wiking looks identical to me
@wiking	mmm there's majorly fucked up something
@wiking	bb: how did u install developer tools?
 bb	x-code select install
 bb	@wiking from the command line
@wiking	bb: mmmm i really do wonder as i really did almost the same
@wiking	and for me it works flawlessly
 bb	xcode-select --install
@wiking	bb: http://pastebin.com/8UL3zy6p
@wiking	this is my cmake output
@wiking	ah ok wait
@wiking	it is different when i enable python modular interface
 bb	@wiking ok are you able to compile with python modular enable
@wiking	bb: yeah i'm just doing it
@wiking	bb: it was actually me who fixed python modular compilation on 10.9 osx
 bb	@wiking okay so you should be able to fix it my case
 bb	@wiking did it compile on your computer
@wiking	bb: yeah w/o any problems
 bb	@wiking so what do you think is the problem
 bb	@wiking see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8177031/does-mac-os-x-have-pthread-spinlock-t-type it says pthread_spinlock_t is not supported on osx
 bb	@wiking and should be using https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/spinlock.3.html
 bb	@wiking do you have special library which handles the pthread_spinlock_t issue
 bb	besser82 any luck with installing it without hdf5
 besser82	bb: not yet  :(
 bb	besser82 looks like i am stuck. i am not sure how wiking got it working on mac osx with pthread not captiple on it
 besser82	bb: that's his secret possibly or he has some not yet publish patch or such...
 bb	besser82 need to be able to install shogun to work on the project..
 besser82	bb: I know we are working on it, I suppose, at least me is trying to to my best...
 bb	besser82 thanks for the help....
