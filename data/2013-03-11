 heiko	blackburn: I think I will add a data generator for this one
 heiko	the toy multiclass data problem seems to be weird, but I dont know what it is
 heiko	blackburn: I will update the example so that you can see whats going on in there
 blackburn	heiko: okay
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Heiko Strathmann :master * 5131bb5 / examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_larank.cpp: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/5131bb50ee2e46d9965f21d94a68c4e6557c3f2c
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: made example way better (random input data means non-sense output) and prepared for unit-test

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: added unit-test for LaRank which asserts basic functionality of classifier

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: used a more sensible data set to actually see whether the method works

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: empty line to make things look nicer

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: new easy toy data data for example

 blackburn	heiko1: what's up with mds?
 blackburn	heiko1: there is a unit-test alrady
 heiko1	blackburn:  mds?
 heiko1	I am currently trying to fix the GPs
 heiko1	simplest cases dont work
 blackburn	heiko1: multidimensional_scaling
 heiko1	crash/return nonsense
 heiko1	blackburn: just check whether it does the correct thing
 heiko1	I cannot do that
 heiko1	and integration test fails
 blackburn	heiko1: all converter examples would fail with integration tests though
 heiko1	blackburn: yeah, can you do something against this? :)
 blackburn	heiko1: no idea..
 heiko1	I will try to fix the gps since this is something that should work
 heiko1	at least the part without model selection
 heiko1	blackburn: sonney2k, sonne|work next gsoc, we should really force people to use valgrind. Some of the gsoc examples from last year massively leak, depend on uninitialised memory etc. This is a hell to fix
 heiko1	maybe we could make make tests mandatory with valgrind
 heiko1	and also always require a proper examples AND a proper test
 heiko1	so example illustrates and ensures memory stuff is clean
 heiko1	unit test makes sure that all modules work
 heiko1	integration test ensures that the method works on toy data
 blackburn	heiko1: gtest has some stuff to replace new and count memory leaks
 heiko1	blackburn: we have that already with trace-mallocs
 heiko1	and valgrind
 heiko1	just have to use it
 heiko1	or more specific:make other people use it
 blackburn	heiko1: I just mean we could automate that with gtest too
 heiko1	the gp stuff is a mess, I get a few hundred memory errors when doing it
 blackburn	be back in 20 mins
 heiko1	blackburn:  we could, but why use a new system when the old one works
 heiko1	I wont be here in 20, see you later then!
 blackburn	heiko1: yes makes sense
 blackburn	heiko1: I'll check mds and ocas
 heiko1	blackburn:  lol now I see why gp return nonsense: it is uninitialised memory what they return :)
 heiko1	or depends on it

@sonney2k	n4nd0, could you put your menu stuff somewhere (even emailing is enough...)
@sonney2k	thanks!
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey!
 n4nd0	I can make a PR if you prefer??
 n4nd0	nah mail is probably better
@sonney2k	n4nd0, i don't care how you do it :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I will send it to you by mail soon
