@sonney2k	gsomix, good morning! how was your night shift?
 gsomix	sonney2k, nice. things are almost done. now I'm writing docs (most difficult part for me) and trying to fix small memory leaks.
 gsomix	sonney2k, how are you? "day off"?
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, I removed "chunk_size". it's not really needed, you're right.

 Yanglittle	when i ./configure --interfaces=python_modular and then make, there's an error gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp:  no such file.. but it can continue to make , what's this error?

@iglesiasg	sonney2k: I am taking a look at the LDA issue, checking the arg_max at the moment
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: are you sure it is ok, it doesn't look ok to tme
@iglesiasg	I mean for inc other than 1, arg_max should be wrong since there is not check for j being less than len in the loop
@iglesiasg	should -> must :)
@iglesiasg	and the ASSERT in the first line should probably be && instead of || as well

 HeikoS	Test
 HeikoS	Ha!
 HeikoS	Check out my handwritten text
 HeikoS	Samsung Tablet
 gsomix	HeikoS, cool. so, now you can make soulful handwritten code? :)
 HeikoS	Noo
 HeikoS	Programming is probably a pain
 HeikoS	but jnit writing is awesome

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Renamed liblinear structures to avoid name clashes in future
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I am dead though...
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: why that?
@lisitsyn	git stash pop
@lisitsyn	oops
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, HeikoS we should probably do this https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bfuIJ_U76rznjfqBYdRKfFlfmvhqrmtpR_SUgTHwif0/viewform
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh all righ
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: who's going to attend from our side?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I haven't received any emails from people interested
@sonney2k	So I think lisitsyn HeikoS and me?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: so heiko and ich?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: except to you of course
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	well should not be a great issue for google I hope
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: did you submit to that form too?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no.
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: so the extra one should?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I just submitted so I am that one I guess :D
@lisitsyn	oh damn I broke the build

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you recall whether anyone else wants to go who I should contact?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: some usa located mentor?
@lisitsyn	someone said sth on that
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: one of van51's mentors?
 HeikoS	sonney2k, Should I fill the form?

@lisitsyn	oh damn

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well you authored some you can't touch this
 HeikoS	lain is a very good guy. He also was here at the Gatsby for his phd
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what task is it for?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn, Inference
 HeikoS	or more general for solving nasty integrals
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what is circumstances you need exactly it?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ahh so like these crazy integrals with gaussian stuff?
 HeikoS	eg. GPs
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so anything else fails?
 HeikoS	for exact inference when you don't want to use approximations or when there are none
 HeikoS	lisitsyn, yeah its the last option that always works in theory
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see
 HeikoS	But might be slow
 HeikoS	we will soon have this in shogun:)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: and is it better than say some other svm or so?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: for your problem I mean
 HeikoS	its something diff event
 HeikoS	diff erent
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: haha
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what makes it special?
 HeikoS	you can do exact inference
 HeikoS	in particular Bayes.
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am fascinated with sampling bayes nets - never thought about that
 HeikoS	Anything Bayesian can be done
 HeikoS	just think of an integral rather than integrating a density
 HeikoS	you can sample from it and compute the empirical estimate of it
 HeikoS	an example is the empincal mean
 HeikoS	which is an estimate for the true expected value
 HeikoS	ah handwriting all this is very exhausting
 HeikoS	phew!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: haha
 HeikoS	lisitsyn, gotta go now. See you later
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you should get a brain - phone interface!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: and do your inference to write text ;) see you
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: they do send visa invitations! that's nice for me
@lisitsyn	let's hope they allocate me too :D
