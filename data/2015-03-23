@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@lisitsyn	need explanation
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	hi
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: shoot
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: why do you think we don't need custom html?
@lisitsyn	I didn't see alternatives want to know

@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: because docutils should contain a node type for simple <div> container, ?
@HeikoS	we then just have to nest them?
@HeikoS	have a look at the page.html layout
@HeikoS	its all just dics
@HeikoS	divs
@lisitsyn	hmm
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: how to set up classes?
@HeikoS	check the file
@HeikoS	nodes.py
@HeikoS	of docutils
@HeikoS	there is a function called container_wrapper
@HeikoS	or so
@HeikoS	there they do something similar
@HeikoS	one can set the class of the div
@HeikoS	but I couldnt figure it out
@HeikoS	so maybe custom html is better
@HeikoS	any idea how to do it?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@59.177.201.71] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	ok let me know
@HeikoS	we are close, lisitsyn :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: sorry I am randomly distracted
@HeikoS	then we can do some templating of the .rst files
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where is that nodes.py?
@HeikoS	locate nodes.py | grep docutils
@lisitsyn	haha ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: see the function?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I have no container_wrapper
@lisitsyn	there is class container
@lisitsyn	I tried that
@lisitsyn	it adds <div> around this stuff
@lisitsyn	but class if 'container'
@HeikoS	container should do it?
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	thats the one I meant
@HeikoS	the function is in
@HeikoS	/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sphinx/directives/code.py
@HeikoS	container_wrapper
@HeikoS	it creates a docutils.nodes.container, and wraps the given node in it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: see?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh
@lisitsyn	let me try that just now
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we should do similar thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yep
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I tried to adapt but I think there is a problem with this hack of modifying the current node
@HeikoS	name clashes or so
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok I managed to add a class
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	push
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: with this, we can just nest them and add the tabs this way
@HeikoS	see page.html
@HeikoS	just need to mimic that
@HeikoS	just leave the tab definitions in page.html for now so that they are for the whole page
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: we need to add 'role'
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok pushed
@lisitsyn	but we still need 'role' attribute
@HeikoS	<div class="tab-content">
@HeikoS	    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane active" id="python">
@HeikoS	      <div class="contents">
@HeikoS	      {{ body }}
@HeikoS	      </div>
@HeikoS	    </div>
@HeikoS	yep
@lisitsyn	class="tab-content container"
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^ that's how outer div looks like
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I am currently busy, will check later
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but should not be too hard to add attributes to containers?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am trying to find how
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: great!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: almost there!
@lisitsyn	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13168702/how-to-add-rel-attribute-to-docutils-sphinx-reference-in-html-output
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ^
@lisitsyn	we need to override visit thing I guess
