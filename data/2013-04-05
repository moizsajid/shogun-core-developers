 n4nd0	sonne|work: hi!
 n4nd0	I checked how this history of changes for the webpage could be added
 n4nd0	It looks like this could be a good star: https://bitbucket.org/dwatkinsweb/django-simple-history
 n4nd0	I reached it from this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/987669/tying-in-to-django-admins-model-history

 sonne|work	n4nd0: hey!
 sonne|work	n4nd0: looks quite promising
 sonne|work	n4nd0: is this then already integrated in the admin view somehow?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I don't think so
 sonne|work	I mean what I don't understand is how one can put an old revision live
 n4nd0	the admin view is customizable
 n4nd0	so I think the idea would be to use this django-simple-history to automatically create revisions of the articles every time they are updated
 n4nd0	or created
 n4nd0	and then modify the admin view as we like to show these old versions
 sonne|work	n4nd0: ok - the only thing that would not work with this is that we cannot select the version to be shown on the website
 sonne|work	it would be nice if we just edit
 sonne|work	and then at some point tag a publish flag
 n4nd0	sonne|work: aham. Yes, that is an even better idea
 n4nd0	That could be done adding a new model probably
 n4nd0	I don't know if it would be the best solution though
 sonne|work	no idea what is best but certainly adding just an integer for the revision and a boolean flag 'published' would do
 sonne|work	ohh no
 sonne|work	it is snowing again!
 blackburn	sonne|work: ha-ha
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw congrats: http://investors.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=754227
 blackburn	sonne|work: oh everybody hates moscow :D
 blackburn	especially its citizens
 blackburn	they basically live in jams
 blackburn	sonne|work: one more thing is that it is crazy expensive to live there and people live outside of the city - then they have to say move 2 hours by train and stay 2 hours in jams
 blackburn	I have absolutely no idea how do they live :D
 blackburn	but I know quite a few that live that way
 sonne|work	doesn't sound nice..
 blackburn	sonne|work: but it is believed that there is no life outside moscow so 10% of russia lives there :D
 sonne|work	hehe
 blackburn	sonne|work: 20M of 140M totally - crazy isn't it?
 sonne|work	its big
 wiking	blackburn: does that mean that we can directly commit to shogun-toolbox/shogun.git?
 blackburn	wiking: yes I think so
 blackburn	not to master though
 wiking	yeah sure thing
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you mind commits to develop without branches?
 blackburn	I don't know if we really should use that hotfix stuff
 wiking	n4nd0: i saw the emails.. sorry but i'm away atm but i'll answer asap
 n4nd0	wiking: sure, no problem
 n4nd0	wiking: I think that he can find what he asked for in the doc of latent svm though
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes - use hotfix?
 sonne|work	that too yes

 blackburn	:D
 heiko	yeee! :)
* sonne|work relaxes :D
-!- sonne|work is now known as sonne|nowork
 heiko	sonne|nowork, blackburn as I said, I probably need some help. I would be up for creating a howto on this and update on the way
 heiko	lets discuss later, got a huge pile of work lying here :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: oh we've got vi{c,k}tors
 blackburn	ZeThomas: hey
 ZeThomas	blackburn: hi
 blackburn	let me get back to your thing
 blackburn	is it still failing?
 ZeThomas	yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe yeah :D
 blackburn	ZeThomas: error 139?
 ZeThomas	indeed
 ZeThomas	happens in the init step apparently
 ZeThomas	line 83 in http://pastebin.com/567TrTnx
 ZeThomas	within the init in line 38: sg.DirectorKernel.init(self, l_features, r_features)
 ZeThomas	I can't dig deeper than that :)
 blackburn	ZeThomas: so 38
 ZeThomas	yep
 blackburn	ZeThomas: can you please run gdb on it?
 ZeThomas	ok, you might have to talk me through this, how do I gdb a python prog?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: gdb --args python yourscript.py
 blackburn	then start
 blackburn	then c
 ZeThomas	ok, I get this: http://pastebin.com/4Bc4dfij
 blackburn	ZeThomas: 'back'
 ZeThomas	http://pastebin.com/0Dw1msdr
 blackburn	ZeThomas: quite interesting heh
 ZeThomas	blackburn: I'm not getting very much out of this... :)
 blackburn	I expect it fails on to->name
 ZeThomas	you mean in the typecheck (is that for the (dummy)features?)
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yeah that's crazy
 ZeThomas	could it be because I have these variables l and r as attributes?
 blackburn	no shouldnot be
 ZeThomas	(renamed them all, to no avail)
 blackburn	ohhh
 blackburn	why do you call init(self, l_features, r_features)
 blackburn	it should be (l_features, r_features) just
 blackburn	sonne|nowork: another trick of python
 blackburn	sonne|nowork: method with 2 parameters is called with 3 parameters and no error (??)
 blackburn	*args, **kwargs probably
 blackburn	ZeThomas: ^
 ZeThomas	blackburn: because DirectorKernel.init is a method with 3 params
 blackburn	ZeThomas: no thats __init__
 blackburn	virtual bool init(CFeatures* l, CFeatures* r)
 ZeThomas	every instance of it automatically fills in itself as first argument
 ZeThomas	no, every class method is like that
 blackburn	yes I know what you mean but I am not sure it is the case
 ZeThomas	blackburn: ok yeah, every python class method
 blackburn	hmm let me think
 ZeThomas	I don't know how CPython then handles this
 blackburn	ZeThomas: cpython?
 ZeThomas	blackburn: scrap that last remark
 blackburn	ZeThomas: yes you are right self is needed here
 blackburn	ZeThomas: could you try to name it custom_init or whatever?
 blackburn	I am worried about name clash
 ZeThomas	blackburn: I tried this: http://pastebin.com/DsP4ka0z and this works fine
 blackburn	true
 ZeThomas	but wait
 blackburn	do you see any difference?
 ZeThomas	I get this warning with this toy example, which I don't get in the other case
 ZeThomas	RuntimeWarning: [WARN] Enforcing to use only one thread due to restrictions of directors
 blackburn	ZeThomas: that's ok
 ZeThomas	why is that?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: director kernel can be called only from one thread
 ZeThomas	yeah, I know, but why is it that in the crashing case I don't get this warning?
 blackburn	your code is not getting to that line
 blackburn	it fails before
 ZeThomas	could it be because I called init already once, in my __init__ ?
 blackburn	but it worked back when?
 blackburn	then*
 ZeThomas	ok there's some stupid stuff in there, I don't know why (I think my lacking vim-fu)
 ZeThomas	like the real __init__ in another one in the abstract class?
 ZeThomas	I'm fixing that first
 blackburn	you mean that __init__ inside __init__?
 ZeThomas	yeah, don't really know why that's there...
 ZeThomas	ok, I seems to work now, this was weird
 ZeThomas	training that svm seems to take ages though
 blackburn	that's strange

 blackburn	ZeThomas: is data big?
 blackburn	the one you work on
 ZeThomas	3500 of these objects I defined my kernel on
 ZeThomas	ok, now it's done training :)

 ZeThomas	dammit
 ZeThomas	after about two iterations, I get that damned 139 again
 ZeThomas	I'll gdb it
 blackburn	ehmm
 ZeThomas	blackburn: ok, here we go: http://pastebin.com/z8fp64VC
 blackburn	ZeThomas: no info at all :)
 ZeThomas	and http://pastebin.com/GZZa4naM
 blackburn	ZeThomas: what happened after the first iteration?
 ZeThomas	this is the code: http://pastebin.com/F9n3GLTy ; iterations are at line 123
 ZeThomas	so it must segfault before the second iteration starts, seeing the output
 ZeThomas	however, that's not a constant, since the previous time it segfaulted after 2 iterations

 ZeThomas	yes, still that one

 blackburn	ZeThomas: can't see anything really wrong
 blackburn	ZeThomas: any idea what is changing?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: which line it fails?
 ZeThomas	blackburn: is there anything else I can type in gdb to give you more info?
 blackburn	ZeThomas: no not really -  what is the line in your python script it fails?
 ZeThomas	blackburn: sec, I'm finding it out
-!- sumit [73f91219@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.249.18.25] has joined #shogun
 ZeThomas	haha I just added some print statements to localise, and it gets further than before
 ZeThomas	gotta love computers
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: are you using all the time the same data?
 ZeThomas	n4nd0: it's randomised, but I set a fixed seed for consistency in testing... If I'm not mistaken this takes all 'randomness' away
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: ok, I think for debuggin you should fix the data
 n4nd0	otherwise it could be completely fine that the code crashes in different parts for each execution
 ZeThomas	well, but that's what setting a seed does, right
 n4nd0	if I were you, I would ensure it :)
 ZeThomas	you're making me curious... checking right now
 ZeThomas	yep, that's good
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: is there any randomness anywhere else in your method?
 ZeThomas	blackburn, n4nd0: it's in the loop at line 87 (this time...); http://pastebin.com/F9n3GLTy
 ZeThomas	and n4nd0: nope, no randomness, as far as I'm aware
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: my point is:
 ZeThomas	the gdb crash location seems now consistent though with how it was outside of it...
 n4nd0	if there is no randomness in the input to your program or on the task it does
 n4nd0	then there must be some invalid memory access
 ZeThomas	that's what I was thinking as well
 n4nd0	since I believe you cannot do this in python, I believe it must be in the C++ code
 n4nd0	valgrind may help you to find it out
 n4nd0	but if you are going to valgrind some python program, you better use a suppression file. Otherwise you will see lot of junk
 ZeThomas	ok, this sounds very vague to me
 n4nd0	hehe ok, sorry
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: so the data you are using, is it big?
 n4nd0	you could for example input minimal data
 n4nd0	print what's going on every few steps on your algorithm
 n4nd0	and make sure it happens as you expect
 ZeThomas	ok, i'll try that
 n4nd0	ok gtg now, see you later
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n186-p150.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 ZeThomas	blackburn: I tried with a smaller dataset now (like a 100 something), and it fails at line 102...
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	102??
 blackburn	what about deeper?
 ZeThomas	it's very weird, because with other kernels this part of the code never fails, and is very unrelated to any shogun code

 heiko	lambday: hi
 lambday	heiko: hey
 lambday	more git stuffs :(
 heiko	git?
 heiko	ah the new dev model you mean?
 lambday	sergey's mail
 lambday	yes...
 heiko	lambday: this is actually gonna help us a lot :)
 lambday	heiko: hmmm... i still haven't checked it..
 heiko	basically you develop new stuff in feature branches
 heiko	which are then committed/merged
 heiko	and eventually merged into thedevelopment branch
 lambday	hmm...
 lambday	I need to check this gitflow thing...
 n4nd0	heiko: btw, we still need to do the PR through github, don't we?
 lambday	and in my system, all I need to do is to change the upstream to "features", right?
 heiko	n4nd0: I think yet, but I haven't comitted anything since then
 n4nd0	heiko: ok
 heiko	lambday, n4nd0 I did not yet have time to check out the details, but check
 heiko	http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow
 heiko	http://labs.grupow.com/blog/2011/07/05/getting-started-with-git-flow
 heiko	and sergey's mail
 heiko	lambday: yes
 heiko	and then
 heiko	http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
 lambday	heiko: hmmm...
 n4nd0	nice, I like videolectures
 lambday	me too me too :D
 heiko	me too :)
 lambday	heiko: by the way, on a different topic, for classification using svm, n train and m test points, the train kernel should be nxn, right? then we train the svm, and then we fit the test kernel nxm in it after training, and use it to get labels.. right?
 heiko	lambday:  let me think ...
 heiko	lambday: yes, thats how it works
 heiko	in shogun we have this lhs rhs thing on the kernel
 lambday	heiko: just a sec, be right back
 heiko	lhs is always training, rhs is first training, then test
 heiko	so exactly training matrix is nxn, test matrix is nxm
