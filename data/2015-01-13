 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
@HeikoS	lambday:  hey man
@HeikoS	long time :)
@HeikoS	how are things
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah really long time
 lambday	HeikoS: things are nice - done with defence and now again back to job
 lambday	HeikoS: I should push the developer readme for linalg before the release
 lambday	24 hrs left now :P
 lambday	HeikoS: how was your trip?
@HeikoS	lambday: cool congrats, so you are now graduated=
@HeikoS	24hrs left? :)
 lambday	HeikoS: hehe thanks.. yes
 lambday	HeikoS: for the release (as per wiking )
@HeikoS	lambday: I see
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah readme would be good
@HeikoS	and cleanups everywhere where possible
@HeikoS	notebook also
@HeikoS	I will be back to Shogun a bit more from next Monday and even more after Feb 6
@HeikoS	lambday: did you see the cool exampl estuff?
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. meanwhile I'll try to carry on with new functionalities for linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah thats also super useful
 lambday	HeikoS: the new shogun example language project?
 lambday	haven't checked yet
@HeikoS	lambday: https://github.com/sorig/shogun.git
@HeikoS	check the branch
@HeikoS	prototyping_meta_language
@HeikoS	and then there is a readme
@HeikoS	that generates modular examples from meta language
@HeikoS	1 example translated to all languages
 lambday	HeikoS: man cool!!!
 lambday	we have our new filetype now... .sg :D
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah text file
@HeikoS	lambday: works for java octave python so far
@HeikoS	and extending is easy
@HeikoS	lambday: oh also matlab swig is there, we might be able to add this soon
@HeikoS	lambday: which means dropping static interfaces is ok
@HeikoS	which is a great cleanup
 lambday	HeikoS: really cool stuff... hats off to sorig and you
 lambday	so translate.py takes care of all these translation
 lambday	or just to python
@HeikoS	lambday: there are two pars: parsing and translating
@HeikoS	parsing outputs a parse tree
@HeikoS	and translating takes a dictionary and the parse tree and generates a listing
@HeikoS	to all languages
@HeikoS	see examples
@HeikoS	or readme
 lambday	HeikoS: this is pure magic :)
 lambday	when will this be merged with main branch?
