@sonney2k	blackburn, so you don't want gsoc to happen this year?
 blackburn	sonney2k: why so?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I didn't see any emails...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I wanted to discuss with you
 blackburn	sonney2k: wrote in jabber actually :D
@sonney2k	I am not at work...
@sonney2k	so no jabber
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am convincing igor carron now
 blackburn	to mentor something
 blackburn	http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.ru/ his blog
@sonney2k	blackburn, that comes later
@sonney2k	first announce our interest
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	look at what I did last year...
@sonney2k	(email archives to the list)
 blackburn	sonney2k: should I ask to do everything in public?
@sonney2k	blackburn, but yes cool
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
@sonney2k	HEAD^^ igor
 blackburn	well for example should I ask possible mentors to announce their interest
 blackburn	in public
 blackburn	or it is ok to contact me
 blackburn	I don't mind any
@sonney2k	blackburn, what I did:
 blackburn	yeah I am searching that mail
@sonney2k	1) tell everyone on the mailinglist we want to participate in gsoc
@sonney2k	2) give them a list of old ideas
@sonney2k	3) mention the new ideas url that we want to update
@sonney2k	4) talk to everyone (phone/chat but in private) who could potentially mentor and what exactly
@sonney2k	5) update the ideas list
@sonney2k	6) apply for gsoc (write proposal)
@sonney2k	7) announce that we are in or not
 blackburn	sounds like an algorithm, thanks :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so it seems I should take it over completely in any case?
 blackburn	like I should say I am responsible for all the stuff about that?
 blackburn	okay I'll write some big mail tonight
@sonney2k	get stuff done man
@sonney2k	not like helping me to fix this bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well I asked that cause if I don't say anything - you will get mails
 blackburn	which you'd need to redirect anyway then
@sonney2k	blackburn, recall the bug about failing GPs?
@sonney2k	blackburn, just post it publicly on the    mailinglist - people will know what to do
@sonney2k	and draft the gsoc2013 ideas list website
 blackburn	sonney2k: ahh that was irony meaning I didn't help you to fix the bug ;D
 blackburn	sonney2k: quite acid!
@sonney2k	blackburn, which it was...
 blackburn	I keep not getting what you mean
@sonney2k	blackburn, recall that you said you will have a look at the bug?
 blackburn	whatever
 blackburn	I said I tried to fix that but didn't managed
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need admin rights in shogun-toolbox org at github
@sonney2k	the compute incremental hash function was called on elements of an empty array (a check was missing...)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what for?
 blackburn	sonney2k: at least to control service hooks
@sonney2k	which hook is missing?
 blackburn	haha okay

 wiking	fl.mmmm
 blackburn	wiking: hello to you too
 wiking	sonney2k: here?
 wiking	hellobello
 wiking	:>
@sonney2k	wiking, wassup god of the north?
 wiking	sonney2k: unittesting
 wiking	sonney2k: have u seen somewhere that stuff explained?
* sonney2k wants - check
 wiking	sonney2k: ok
 wiking	sonney2k:  i'll try to see how we can do it
 wiking	but afaik it'll only work with ubuntu/debian systems
 wiking	as i have no clue how the others are handling those
 wiking	i mean the gtest+gmock package
@sonney2k	wiking, perfectly ok with me - IMHO none of the devs uses anything els
@sonney2k	e
 wiking	sonney2k: meeee
 wiking	sonney2k:  i use os
 wiking	osx
@sonney2k	yeah but you can take care of yourself :D
 wiking	good
 n4nd0	I am using arch
 wiking	n4nd0: hehehe ok then you can help me
 n4nd0	but I can try to care of me too :D
 wiking	n4nd0: can u check if you have google unit test package?
 wiking	n4nd0: and google mock package?
 n4nd0	wiking: I installed gtest this morning actually, I needed it for ROS - uni work
 wiking	n4nd0: ehehhe u use ROS? cool
 n4nd0	wiking: I have started today
 wiking	n4nd0: ok can you send me in pastebin or somewhere what is the package content for gtest?
 n4nd0	I am going to use it for my thesis
 wiking	n4nd0: when r u finishing?
 n4nd0	wiking: http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ enough?
 n4nd0	wiking: I have started this week :D
 wiking	n4nd0: mmmm yeah that one
 n4nd0	I plan to be finished by August - September
 wiking	but do you have that in package on arch?
 wiking	or you installed it from src/svn?
 n4nd0	wiking: yep, it is in arch
 n4nd0	it can be installed with pacman
 n4nd0	I believe it was only available through AUR not so long ago
 wiking	ok
 wiking	can u give me the content of package?
 wiking	sonney2k: have u heard of this: google-glog
 n4nd0	wiking: let me see
 wiking	sonney2k: but imho log4cxx is more mature
 wiking	n4nd0: thnx just put the whole file list into pastebin or something
 wiking	n4nd0: with debian you would do dpkg -L <package name>
@sonney2k	wiking, if I would switch then to log4cxx but there is no urgent need to do it
 wiking	but i don't know for arch
 n4nd0	I had to installed that one too before log4cxx, it seems that people from ROS the same tools
 wiking	sonney2k: k
 blackburn	wiking: what can you mentor?
 n4nd0	wiking: I have a few files here under /usr/include/gtest, I am not sure which one you need
 n4nd0	stupid question probably hehe ^
 wiking	blackburn: mmm well i'd happily mentor either a full redesign of optimization. to finally have a good general interface for optimizers
 wiking	blackburn: or continue working with SO or latent stuff
 n4nd0	I'd really like to continue with SO!
 blackburn	wiking: can you please try to describe these ideas next week
 blackburn	?
 n4nd0	atm I am reading the tutorial that Cheng posted on the mailing list regarding SO in CV
@sonney2k	hmmh does anyone know what special stuff happened on february 1st? we had >600 new visitors that day
 n4nd0	sonney2k: something workshop related maybe?
 wiking	sonney2k: i guess it's because they've realised from last year
@sonney2k	n4nd0, your email?
 wiking	sonney2k: that they need to have a PR before doing anything with shogun in gsoc ;)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I just checked and I sent it February the 2nd, 01:12 am CET
 wiking	sonney2k: you thaught them well ;)
 wiking	blackburn: till next week?
 wiking	n4nd0: ok so nothing else just /usr/include/gtest ?
 wiking	n4nd0: do you maybe have something under /usr/src?
 wiking	n4nd0: or maybe /usr/lib
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: till end of next week I think
@sonney2k	all these new visitors came from china!
 blackburn	oh sh
 wiking	blackburn: okey
 blackburn	n4nd0: we'd need a mentor for you
 wiking	n4nd0: wantme? :)
 n4nd0	wiking: I have stuff in /usr/src/gtest
 wiking	i mean as a mentor :)
 n4nd0	wiking: sure :)
 wiking	n4nd0: ooooh COOOL
 blackburn	coupling you with wiking would be not so good I think - we need fresh people
 wiking	blackburn: :D
 wiking	blackburn: fresh meat :)
 blackburn	yeah in means of mentoring too
 wiking	n4nd0: ok then it's the same as in debian
 wiking	n4nd0: can u check if there's google mock package for arch?
 blackburn	however if you want it so much we'd think about it
 n4nd0	wiking: these files are under /usr/src/gtest/src
 n4nd0	wiking: gtest-all.cc   gtest.h        gtest_main.cc
 wiking	n4nd0: yep that's cool
 n4nd0	wiking: I have not found it in pacman repos
 wiking	n4nd0: aha ok!
 n4nd0	there should be sth in AUR I guess
 n4nd0	let me see
 wiking	thnx
@sonney2k	wiking, n4nd0, blackburn once we have some more tests active we should really release 2.1
 n4nd0	wiking: here you go https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gmock/
@sonney2k	not like last year

 n4nd0	I was thinking these days
@sonney2k	last year we failed to release before n4nd0 made us drown in patches
 n4nd0	what about a project just focused on examples??
 n4nd0	:(
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: hey there - good time to visit us
@sonney2k	and so we had no more time to release
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: want student this year?
 wiking	sonney2k: yep
 n4nd0	I think Georg Zeller did great last year helping me, we could ask him too
 wiking	n4nd0: thnx
 n4nd0	wiking: do you need me to install it?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, then please ask him if he has anything
 wiking	n4nd0: well i'm just checking now whether i can find out what's the content of this package... i guess from the tarball i can get that info
 n4nd0	wiking: ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, I am mailing him right now
@sonney2k	wiking, well make it work for debian / ubuntu first then one step at a time...
 n4nd0	blackburn: what is your @hsogun-toolbox.org address, I'll CC you
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah i'm on it now
 blackburn	n4nd0: sergey.lisitsyn@
 n4nd0	blackburn: ty
@sonney2k	does anyone know what http://www.weibo.com/ is?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ??????????????
 blackburn	how can you don't understand?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	if I press translate in my chrome it says it is microblogging
@sonney2k	so someone blogged about shogun there I guess
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, did you ask about rooms at TU for the after workshop party?
 blackburn	http://qing.weibo.com/1653362857/628c50a9330015y2.html
 blackburn	may be that
 n4nd0	published 2012-04-24 I think
@sonney2k	blackburn, rather not yeah exactly^
 blackburn	hah yeah
 blackburn	wrong
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw if you want to know how shogun is used - check this http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=shogun+toolbox&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=
@sonney2k	A food image recognition system with multiple kernel learning :D
@sonney2k	How far can you get with a modern face recognition test set using only simple features?
 alexlovesdata	student for what, blackburn?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: gsoc
@sonney2k	Geotagged photo recognition using corresponding aerial photos with multiple kernel learning
 blackburn	sonney2k: old.. - just nothing from 2012
@sonney2k	A surf-based spatio-temporal feature for feature-fusion-based action recognition
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2k ... not yet ... I want to check that mean assert but now
 alexlovesdata	that mean assert bug now
@sonney2k	look there are you :) ????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????????
 blackburn	sonney2k: lol
 blackburn	you scary people with these words
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you translate it?
 blackburn	with your mind I mean
@sonney2k	almost
@sonney2k	some words are missing
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, please put this next on the list then
 blackburn	sonney2k: which?
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, about the assertion failure
@sonney2k	it assumes that 0.9 accuracy on that data set is possible
@sonney2k	did anyone test if this is reasonable?
@sonney2k	I mean what does KNN get on this dataset?
 alexlovesdata	it has to do with traffic sign detection
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2K: i finmd this non reasonable
 blackburn	sonney2k: alexlovesdata: may be some student polishing mkl?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ????????????? ????????
 alexlovesdata	because we use some data and some kernels and non-sparse MKL
 blackburn	sonney2k: recognition, road
 alexlovesdata	Hogs for traffic sign detection
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: bingo
 alexlovesdata	but i do not know opornyi vektor
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: stupid to write about that, isn't it? :D
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, support vector
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: support vector
 alexlovesdata	ohh, thx blackburn
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2k: I want to check the performance of that example
 blackburn	original vapnik's name :D
 alexlovesdata	and then if it is reasonably high with good kernels remove that assertion
 blackburn	not the name of vapnik I mean - but the method's name
 alexlovesdata	hehehe, I got it blackburn ... opornyi vektor ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, why did you say there is nothing from 2012 in the scholar list: Predicting the outcome of renal transplantation, Forensic identification with environmental samples ...
@sonney2k	lots of
 blackburn	sonney2k: hm well there are some
 blackburn	top matches are from other libraries though
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2k: I will take care of the room question, ... for how many people and what days?
 alexlovesdata	aboutl iterature and things using shogun: my Plos ONE paper, my CVIU paper
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, I guess <20 people for the weekend sat/sunday
 alexlovesdata	@ sonney2k thanks! I willask andrea about our room first ... why not?
@sonney2k	blackburn, let me guess weka and libsvm/liblinear?
 alexlovesdata	andrea = Klaus secretary
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean other libraries that publish mention us
 blackburn	like 'toolbox for doing all the shit'
 blackburn	and they say there is other toolbox, shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure they have to compare against
 alexlovesdata	@blackburn: about Gsoc 2013 ... not sure yet ... too many things now above my head

 alexlovesdata	question: where is data in the sgonu git?
 alexlovesdata	in the shogun git?
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: it is in a git submodule
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: do you want to get it locally?
 alexlovesdata	yes, exactly nando
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: go to the root of your git repo and run
 n4nd0	git submodule update --init
 alexlovesdata	ahh ok, ... it is cloning data
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: :)
-!- FSCV_ [~FSCV@173.254.212.46] has joined #shogun
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2k: the example works fine  with me with errors > 0.93
 alexlovesdata	but the results are non-deterministic
 alexlovesdata	so it can happen that sometimes it drops < 0.9
 alexlovesdata	I suggestion to lower the assertion to 0.75
 alexlovesdata	as a fix
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, ohh I see
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, maybe we better initialize the random number generator
 alexlovesdata	I will try to push a commit ... i must learn that anyway :)
 alexlovesdata	@sonney2k ... good idea
-!- FSCV [~FSCV@173.254.212.46] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, I guess it is due to the way the x-validation split is chosen?
 alexlovesdata	I will try to init the random number generator and check whether this is deterministic then
@sonney2k	kthx
 alexlovesdata	good! : CMath::init_random(1); yields a reproducible result
 alexlovesdata	above 0.9
 alexlovesdata	I will push a whatever fix
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, that will be your first pull request right? did it just take 2 years to convince you github is not your enemy ;)
 alexlovesdata	hahaha, sonne, no ... I just needed some hours of time without haste ... nothing can be really appreciated when running too fast
 alexlovesdata	I will chekc how to init a pull request from my remote to shogun ...

@sonney2k	pending valgrind runs this should bring us back to normal.
@sonney2k	Zzzz...
 alexlovesdata	do we have Kernel fisher discriminant in shogun?
 blackburn	no
 alexlovesdata	should be easy to implement ... ten lines in matlab when we use spectral regression
 blackburn	if you give matlab code to me I can implement that using eigen3
 blackburn	or you can :)
 n4nd0	or maybe it is a good patch for someone who wants to get involved in gsoc ;)
 blackburn	n4nd0: you?
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha why not
 n4nd0	but I was thinking of new-comers
 blackburn	n4nd0: if you want to do some monotone work - feel free to check for some code in .h
 blackburn	you know what to do with that code ;)
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	are we purifying the code from those things?
 n4nd0	online inline methods to survive?
 n4nd0	s/online/only
 blackburn	I don't see much help from inline methods
 alexlovesdata	what is .h ?
 n4nd0	I did in my head only inline -> online
 n4nd0	lol
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: extension, header :)
 alexlovesdata	ye ... but what has that t odo with monotone work?
 blackburn	the more code we have in .h the slower compilation is
 alexlovesdata	I know .h is a C header
 n4nd0	exactly
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: we need to get all the code to .cpp
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: yes apparently .hpp is a proper extension
 alexlovesdata	I never code routines in .h
 alexlovesdata	not even inits ...
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: that's gut :)
 blackburn	I am the guilty who did that I think
 alexlovesdata	I could also try to  fight with eigen3 myself ... but thanks you for the offer
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: feel free to ask me about eigen3 as well - I spent a lot of nights having luv time with eigen3
 blackburn	there are some issues when you don't understand how to do something - it takes time to google
 alexlovesdata	ye ... true
 alexlovesdata	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/methods.html preprocessors lacks http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/classshogun_1_1CRandomFourierGaussPreproc.html

 wiking	n4nd0: what is the make/configure env for ROS? cmake?
 n4nd0	wiking: they use cmake yes
 wiking	n4nd0: ok
 wiking	n4nd0: thnx
 n4nd0	np
 n4nd0	wiking: what is it you are working on?
 n4nd0	just curious
 wiking	n4nd0: trying to integrate into shogun to compile the gtest with the same flags as shogun is build with
 wiking	as that's the proper way to use gtest
 n4nd0	aham I see

 blackburn	I am trying to replace one pointer field in kernel with shared_ptr
 heiko	sonney2k, sonne|work, blackburn around?
 blackburn	it goes ok actually - a few changes
 blackburn	heiko: ja
 heiko	hi :)
 heiko	I just saw a cool talk
 blackburn	about love?
 heiko	on a hybrid cholesky algorithm which works on multiple core cpus and GPU
 blackburn	nerd
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	 :)
 heiko	I talked the author into integrating that into shogun
 n4nd0	hi heiko
 n4nd0	is it CUDA?
 heiko	n4nd0, hi :)
 heiko	yes
 n4nd0	nice
 wiking	mmm
 blackburn	heiko: may be he should rather integrate it to eigen
 heiko	quite interesting thing he did
 blackburn	heiko: cholesky is needed in gps, right?
 heiko	cholesky is needed everywhere where there is the word "Gaussian"
 blackburn	eigen has pretty nice cholesky anyway
 blackburn	are there such big matrices?
 heiko	blackburn, the GPU is used
 heiko	this changes things
 heiko	with eigen, you are right, but eigen has no cuda dependecies :)
 blackburn	heiko: how does he code gpu? it is a great matter
 heiko	cuda c
 blackburn	heiko: eigen runs on cuda
 heiko	really?
 heiko	mmh
 heiko	maybe then this would be a better idea you are right
 heiko	but you know what?
 blackburn	yeah gael works on some port
 heiko	it will be exclusive to shogun otherwise :D
 n4nd0	haha
 heiko	*and* he could try to make it mature in a safe environment
 n4nd0	SHOGUN - Machine learning and linear algebra toolbox :D
 heiko	and then once its working fine, put it into eigen
 heiko	n4nd0, well :)
 blackburn	cuda is nvidia property I am not the biggest fan of it
 n4nd0	blackburn: why not?
 heiko	blackburn, agreed, but everyone has a GPU
 heiko	so one should use them
 blackburn	I don't
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	its like 20 times faster on 10000 matrices
 blackburn	HD4000 is not a gpu :D
 heiko	blackburn, doesnt it have opencl bindings?
 heiko	it is a gpu for sure
 blackburn	heiko: kind of useless
 blackburn	heiko: but we need gpu desperately - can't say anything against it
 n4nd0	isn't any graphics card a GPU?
 heiko	blackburn, so what about the argument, that all the people were very interested in it
 heiko	n4nd0 I think yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: well sure but compare some nvidia board in big computer
 heiko	but cuda does only work on nvidia
 blackburn	and hd4000 in my notebook :D

 blackburn	heiko: I am not against that
 heiko	http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/events/76
 heiko	have a look, it also depends whether the guy is willing to port it to shogun (requires at least some work)
 blackburn	heiko: we all need new technologies to have more freedom
 heiko	blackburn, indeed
 n4nd0	blackburn: you made me think when you said the nvidia thing
 n4nd0	I assumed that CUDA must be used if one wants to use GPU
 blackburn	n4nd0: no there is opencl
 blackburn	which is powerful as well
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	and *open* :)
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	I don't like to be stallman but still
 n4nd0	from wikipedia
 n4nd0	"if the OpenCL implementation is correctly tweaked to suit the target architecture, it performs no worse than CUDA"
 n4nd0	it sounds like CUDA tends to perform better :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes that's natural
 n4nd0	but limited to nvidia
 n4nd0	yes, I continued reading and it's true
 blackburn	you pay for generality
 heiko	cuda is completely closed
 heiko	the used to give away source code
 heiko	but not anymore
 heiko	the guy just told me
 heiko	so this is a bad thing in general, I agree with blackburn
 blackburn	I can't run cuda on my machine
 heiko	blackburn, the guy also talked about opencl, seems to be not too complicated to port it from cude to opencl
 n4nd0	how different is to program in OpenCL and CUDA?
 heiko	maybe we can convince him
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	quite different I think - it depends on the complexity
 heiko	n4nd0, I think its very similar, though opencl may not have all the features
 blackburn	hah
 heiko	blackburn, lol :)
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	if it is matrix algorithm
 blackburn	shoudl be similar I believe
 heiko	yes, this is what I meant
 blackburn	in case of something with kernels - it could get worse
 heiko	kernels on gpus?
 heiko	this is crazy :)
 blackburn	heiko: gpu kernels
 heiko	haha :)
 heiko	I see
 blackburn	you can tailor some code to run on gpu
 blackburn	using C
 n4nd0	blackburn: both cuda and opencl use the concept of kernels right?
 blackburn	I think so n4nd0
 heiko	Metropolis-Hasting-Kernel, Gaussian Kernel, Covariance Kernek, GPU-kernel, Linux-kernel, Kernel of a linear map
 heiko	aaaaaah
 n4nd0	haha people seem to like that word
 blackburn	heiko: epanechnikov kernel
 blackburn	heiko: in density estimation
 heiko	that sound too Russian for me :)
 heiko	bb in 5 mins
 blackburn	heiko: it is
 n4nd0	blackburn: AFAIK you need kernels to use the GPU at least in CUDA
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes but you don't have to write complex stuff if you do something with matrices I think
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	n4nd0: however as I see you'd need to write kernel anyway yes
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	there is an idea that keep me nervous
 n4nd0	which one?
 blackburn	I am curious if it is possible to write algorithms using some 'workers'
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me more :)
 blackburn	so you want to train svm which means you run a few workers that do that
 blackburn	they should be kind of actors or os
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	that idea is so simple but I can't understand how to do that in general
 n4nd0	workers are to be run in parallel I understand
 blackburn	not only parallel but also distributed
 blackburn	proablby mahout works somehow like that
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	what is it that you don't understand how to make it general?
 blackburn	would be so cool to have something like general principle of doing that
 heiko	re
 blackburn	probably I am talking about map-reduce :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe maybe
 blackburn	I wouldn't like to write map-reduce code - it is mahout stuff
 n4nd0	blackburn: you can use frameworks like hadoop for the map/rduce part
 heiko	btw I advertised the workshop a bit here
 blackburn	n4nd0: that's what mahout does
 heiko	few people said they might come
 n4nd0	heiko: that's cool :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: true
 heiko	all the kernel people are here in London, so we might already have two of them :) I will also harass the others
 n4nd0	heiko: what kernel are we talking about now? :D
 heiko	haha :D
 heiko	linux-kernel
 blackburn	so, heiko, all mercer cult fellows?
 heiko	blackburn, yes, more the RKHS guys with characteristic kernels, distribution embeddings, kernels on MDPs
 heiko	etc
 blackburn	hare krishna hare RKHS
 heiko	I will also invite John-Shawe-Taylor  :)
 heiko	but he is ever busy
 blackburn	no idea who it is
 heiko	made them popular for ML
 blackburn	nice
 heiko	blackburn, I also have some other ideas on things to integrate into shogun
 heiko	one being the computation of determinants of very large matrices
 blackburn	heiko: what about this year gsoc?
 heiko	blackburn, what do you mean?
 blackburn	heiko: student/mentor? :)
 heiko	blackburn, I can do a mentor this year
 blackburn	you probably have two choices only
 heiko	since I have a job finally :)
 blackburn	yeah same here
 heiko	nice
 heiko	Could also implement stuff myself, but maybe its less stressful to tell others what to do
 blackburn	gsoc have the same monetary value for me now
 blackburn	so I wouldn't like to left my job because of gsoc :)
 heiko	yeah, I mean are you even a student now?
 blackburn	heiko: I am
 heiko	I am not, would have to become one in order to participate
 heiko	oh, ok
 heiko	hopefully we can manage the gsoc this year
 blackburn	and will be for an year more after that
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	but I will have a bit more time from spring on
 blackburn	I could participate twice more
 n4nd0	heiko: but you are phd student now right?
 heiko	n4nd0, not yet
 heiko	hopefully in sept
 n4nd0	heiko: aaaah ok
 heiko	just had my interview last week
 n4nd0	oh, I wish you good luck with the selection then!
 heiko	thanks :)
 n4nd0	aiming at UCL?
 heiko	yes, http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/
 blackburn	heiko: I will announce gsoc initiative tonight
 heiko	but its quite competetive, the alternative is here: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/heiko-strathmann
 heiko	blackburn, initiative? like ideas etc?
 heiko	when do we have to apply?
 blackburn	heiko: gsoc is not yet announced :)
 heiko	n4nd0, how are your studies going?
 heiko	blackburn, so what will you announce?
 blackburn	heiko: that we are going to apply
 heiko	isn't it better to wait until it is announced?
 n4nd0	heiko: fine, I started this week my master thesis at KTH finally
 blackburn	heiko: sonney2k doesn't think so
 heiko	n4nd0, nice master in? CS?
 heiko	blackburn, well ok, actually I would agree
 n4nd0	heiko: the plan is to be done with the few things I have left for Spain by May-June and finish the master thesis by August-September
 heiko	since we are currently slow with everything
 blackburn	heiko: but I am checking for mentorship  already
 n4nd0	heiko: half way between CS and EE, it is a robotics master
 heiko	n4nd0, very cool!
 n4nd0	heiko: but I do CS stuff
 heiko	you have to show some cool robot videos
 n4nd0	heiko: I have something from a course I did a couple of years ago
 heiko	n4nd0, are you using your special svms somewhere in that?
 n4nd0	heiko: no hehe
 blackburn	heiko: I wanted to talk about GPs :D
 blackburn	heiko: just in a few words - why?
 blackburn	what makes it special?
 heiko	n4nd0, show me, I also have one cool video of an AR-drone
 heiko	blackburn, what?
 blackburn	heiko: why should I choose GP and when?
 n4nd0	heiko: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqfwsNfYS8A
 n4nd0	heiko: this is very crappy compared to a drone hehe
 n4nd0	but we built it from scratch
 blackburn	n4nd0: you never showed that to me - it was a mistake I married you!
 heiko	n4nd0, cool! :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha
 n4nd0	I think I had posted that video around here before!
 n4nd0	heiko: this is the lab where I am at KTH http://www.kth.se/en/csc/forskning/cvap
 heiko	cool stuff
 n4nd0	I want to become a phd here too
 heiko	blackburn, well you can use them to model complex functions
 heiko	within a probabilistic framework
 heiko	so quite flexible, they are used everywhere
 heiko	and fully Bayesian, which is sometimes very useful
 blackburn	heiko: my gf is working with hyperspectral images (d ~80) - should I recommend to try GPs?
 blackburn	task is classification mostly
 heiko	what is the goal?
 blackburn	heiko: top accuracy I think
 heiko	to obtain high-accuracy predictions?
 heiko	then better use an SVM
 heiko	although they are similar
 blackburn	but training samples are very noised
 heiko	but if you are interested in predictive distributions, Bayesian kernel selecton or similar, use GPs
 blackburn	heiko: so it is still kind of theoretical?
 heiko	blackburn, no, just depends on what you want
 heiko	predictive distributions can be very useful
 blackburn	heiko: how can one use it?
 heiko	since you for example have probabilities for multiclass problems
 heiko	very useful
 heiko	but not so much for binary decisions
 heiko	and kernel selection also, you can have a posterior distribution over Gaussian kernel sizes in every dimension for example
 blackburn	heiko: predictions are multiclass in that case (water, asphalt, ...)
 heiko	blackburn, use svms, much easier if you just want to predict :)
 blackburn	heiko: well her supervisor wants to promote some method so they use it yet
 heiko	blackburn, probabilitites can be useful
 heiko	since you can add a decision "dont know"
 blackburn	yes that's clear
 n4nd0	heiko: wow the drone is following his face?
 heiko	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	heiko: that's pretty cool
 heiko	using opencv
 heiko	this ar drone is really cool
 blackburn	heiko: is it you on the video with long hair? :)
 heiko	yeh with the red trousers, thats me :)
 heiko	about 1,5 yrs ago
 blackburn	looks pink :D
 heiko	now I look more exhausted ;)
 blackburn	heiko: even more?
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	hah
 blackburn	on the 0006 it detected your groin heiko
 heiko	that was a cool thing, this printer company, oce, bought us a few of those drones and sponsored us playing with them for one week - in holland
 n4nd0	oh that's nice!
 blackburn	heiko: did you implement that?
 blackburn	it looks like you were kinda presenting it
 heiko	blackburn, yes
 heiko	used opencv to track the face
 heiko	then generated movement commands from that
 blackburn	heiko: typical VJ stuff?
 heiko	where the difficulty was to estimate the distance to the face with one camera
 heiko	since face size is not linear to distance
 blackburn	heiko: yes d^2
 heiko	did a power-regression
 heiko	blackburn, no interestingly not
 heiko	another function
 blackburn	hmm yes sure
 blackburn	I am wrong
 heiko	and with that we got a +-10cm estimate
 blackburn	it looks like something else
 heiko	which can be used to move back and forth
 blackburn	I can imagine a plot of that function
 alexlovesdata	hey n4ndo ... you are also a computer vision guy ...
 heiko	very simple, but looks cool
 blackburn	well when it comes to say 5 meters
 blackburn	5.5 and 4.5 - no matter
 blackburn	size won't change at all :D
 heiko	blackburn, yes also the camera resolution is horrible as you can see
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: what to do if not CV
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	but our "data" (measured distance by hand) was explained with almost no error
 heiko	guys, I gotta do some work now, see you later!
 blackburn	cu
 n4nd0	bye!
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: I am more into robotics localization, mapping, SLAM and that stuff
 n4nd0	but yeah there is lot of CV used in that too
 n4nd0	kinect sensors, kinect sensors eveywhere :)
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, I just git pull'd and guess what I still have the issue plus a couple more due to blackburn's arpack removal
@sonney2k	and fibonaccyheap and convertree
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?
 blackburn	shit
 n4nd0	what happens with them?
 blackburn	sonney2k: 2 mins
 alexlovesdata	you still have that assertion error, sonney2k ??
 alexlovesdata	what accuracy is printed before the assert fails?
 alexlovesdata	I get a 0.94 ...

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Removed fibheap and arpack examples
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, 0.76
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw why did you remove arpack / fibheap?
 blackburn	sonney2k: why are not needed anymore
 blackburn	duplicated
 blackburn	sonney2k: I strongly don't expect we use it somewhere out of tapkee
@sonney2k	I see ok
 blackburn	so the only reason they appeared in shogun was dimred
 blackburn	fibonacci heap stayed in tapkee
 blackburn	arpack wrapper was replaced with better one
 wiking	ok here comes a semi-working google unit tester
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, did you git pull and have > 0.9 accuracy?
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata, look the buildbot is also not happy http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/655/steps/test%20libshogun/logs/stdio

@sonney2k	wiking, ar is hardcoded - just found it line 576 in Makefile.template
@sonney2k	wiking, feel free to introduce a variable for it
 blackburn	sonney2k: would you like if we put shared_ptr from boost to our lib?
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha have you hear yandex is more popular than bing :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually it looks like changing internal (class field) pointers to shared_ptrs is not that difficult
@sonney2k	blackburn, this is something we cannot do inside gsoc
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, really? bing sucks I knew that
 blackburn	but I don't use yandex at all
@sonney2k	I am afraid this might be much more work
 blackburn	sonney2k: it could introduce bugs - that's I am more afraid of - but I changed one field in CKernel to shared_ptr and just had to change a few casts in siblings

 wiking	heiko: ok
 heiko	have some time on the weekend, nice work
 wiking	heiko: note that you'lll need google mock source... the package in ubuntu is not good

 wiking	Checking for Google C++ Mocking Framework ... yes
 wiking	if it's not yes then plz copy-paste here the error line
 blackburn	check da announcement
 wiking	which?
 blackburn	at mailing list
@sonney2k	wiking, it just says
@sonney2k	============ Checking for Google C++ Mocking Framework ============
@sonney2k	Result is: no
@sonney2k	you could have made it a little more verbose :-]
@sonney2k	wiking, can I split it up in separate gmock/ gtest tests?
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmhh afk? then let me just do it
 blackburn	http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013 hah google can't suggest another theme this time
@sonney2k	blackburn, so they are running out of money?
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's a great implication out of my mind
 blackburn	too complex for me :)
 blackburn	may be it feels ok for them to keep old graphics
* sonney2k continous the gmock/gtest endeavor
 blackburn	sonney2k: we should name shogun versions by bacterias
 blackburn	sonney2k: escherichia coli
@sonney2k	blackburn, or virii
@sonney2k	but only the very bad bad ones
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, may be 3.0 should be called HIV
@sonney2k	blackburn, when we introduce self modifying codes and template meta programming then it surely will be!
 blackburn	sonney2k: we should take some bacteria branch with increasing complexity
 blackburn	and then put next name each time we release :)
 wiking	sonney2k: i've tried that
 wiking	sonney2k: i mean splitting
@sonney2k	wiking, give a a few more minutes...
 wiking	sonney2k: but one without the ohter is useless
 wiking	sonney2k: but not in configure.log
 wiking	sonney2k: the simple output of configure

@sonney2k	wiking, please try if it works ^

@sonney2k	blackburn, just copy it from last year for now
 wiking	sonney2k: works
@sonney2k	recall everyone can edit now so it is a good start
@sonney2k	in particular the optimization thing is still valid
@sonney2k	and I want someone to code examples and write d3js / django interactive code
@sonney2k	for some show down
@sonney2k	let me ask Mr. ICA
 blackburn	sonney2k: please cc me if that's ok
@sonney2k	if he would be interested in getting ICA in
 blackburn	sonney2k: ICA is pretty small
 blackburn	even fastICA is not that much code
@sonney2k	there are tons of algorithms for that
@sonney2k	a. ziehe - tdsep
 blackburn	sonney2k: haha I didn't expect you write in that lang
@sonney2k	blackburn, I can hardly talk in $OTHERLANG to a friend :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: google translate helped me a little
@sonney2k	blackburn, lets hope AZ is in. he did some cool stuff on that matter and has some nice examples too!
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, if I wasn't afraid of multiboost I would ask them
 blackburn	sonney2k: why you are afraid?
@sonney2k	mission impossible
@sonney2k	we also need some small ideas to be implemented for potential candidates...
@sonney2k	wiking, ok nice
@sonney2k	wiking, how do I run a test now?
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is impossible in multiboost?
 wiking	sonney2k: in ./tests/unit run make
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh gosh that's a list!
@sonney2k	blackburn, https://www.ohloh.net/p/shogun
 blackburn	by gunnar
 blackburn	that's THE LIST
@sonney2k	notice the peak?
@sonney2k	at ~2010
 blackburn	of code?
@sonney2k	that is when I merged and removed their code
 blackburn	of commits?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	code
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	LoC
@sonney2k	blackburn, which list?
@sonney2k	boosting list?
 blackburn	sonney2k: gunnar forwarded my mail
@sonney2k	heh :)
 wiking	sonney2k: works?
 wiking	sonney2k: should get some errors
 blackburn	sonney2k: 'das Programm announced noch' is that german or you switched lang accidentally?
 blackburn	I am just curious
@sonney2k	blackburn, my german is ruined :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I feel inspired when trying to read deutsch
 blackburn	looks so fancy :)
 blackburn	noch wissen! wir ob wir! aus berline!
 blackburn	berlin*
 blackburn	machinnes lernen
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	Un?berwachtes Lernen!
 blackburn	oh correct is maschinelles lernen
 n4nd0	wiking: do you think gtest/gmock should work fine here?
 n4nd0	I can test it if so

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Removed shameful not stable mark from Local Alignment string kernel
@sonney2k	n4nd0, please try
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 n4nd0	just need to configure for it and build I guess
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0, wiking - what does ./evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl give you when you run it?
 blackburn	oh well let me compile latest
@sonney2k	*lol* http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/02/04/chinas-photoshop-experts-will-fix-your-bad-photos-but-be-careful-what-you-wish-for/

 blackburn	and http://images.webpark.ru/uploads54/120913/Photoshop_13.jpg
@sonney2k	wiking, can you please fix the 2 failing gtests ? I want to enable them in the builds!
@sonney2k	buildbots taht is
@sonney2k	otherwise we will never have them
@sonney2k	blackburn, *lol*

@sonney2k	*megarotflbtc*
 wiking	n4nd0: try
 wiking	sonney2k: btw make unit-tests in ./shogun/src should work as well
 wiking	hopefully
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can't compile examples here
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	yeah your thing with ;
 blackburn	sonney2k: why did you do that? it is better to have ;
@sonney2k	wiking, there is no make unit-tests?
@sonney2k	blackburn, was not possible
 blackburn	sonney2k: mean assert failed here
 blackburn	0.76
 blackburn	hah well setting seed won't work
@sonney2k	blackburn, issue is that when you have a more complex macro that includes if (cond) { sth; }
 blackburn	it is not machine independent
 n4nd0	wiking: moment please
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah you added unlikely
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it fails everywhere I tried
 blackburn	good
@sonney2k	so I wonder if someone here gets a 0.9
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you still have a 32bit system?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am using 64 OS
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah and I need these extra { } brackets
 blackburn	sonney2k: you could put it to { } block
@sonney2k	so only fix would be to change coding style to require
@sonney2k	if ()
 blackburn	then ; would work
@sonney2k	{
@sonney2k	}
@sonney2k	else
@sonney2k	{
@sonney2k	}
@sonney2k	alwyas
 blackburn	ah it is already in
 blackburn	sh
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure long tiem
@sonney2k	time
 blackburn	so { ... }; is not possible?
@sonney2k	it is but not
@sonney2k	if () {}; else {}
@sonney2k	the else is then out of context
 blackburn	no I mean
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	but if we had if () { {}; } else {} all good
 blackburn	okay got it
@sonney2k	so that is why maybe we should change it to using {} always
 blackburn	macro w/o ; in the end is bad
@sonney2k	blackburn, log4cxx does that too...
 blackburn	sonney2k: if we get igor we could get some factorizations/sparse stuff
 blackburn	I don't give a fuck what they are doing but sounds magical
@sonney2k	blackburn, watch your language...
 blackburn	pooo
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you getting too old for such language? :)
 blackburn	anyway sonney2k not only ICA but some NMF or so would be nice
 blackburn	it is really cool as we are now learning features not only classifiers
 blackburn	desperately need group lasso specialist
@sonney2k	wiking, haha you unit tests found an error in SGVector::max - the function you introduced utilizing atlas to find the max :)
@sonney2k	scary!
@sonney2k	all hail unit tests!
 blackburn	sonney2k: does shogun pass unit tests?
@sonney2k	you mean the 8 we have :D
 blackburn	yes still
@sonney2k	6/8 currently
@sonney2k	but I think I fixed the max issue now
 blackburn	sonney2k: we need code coverage computation
 blackburn	to understand how it is covered
@sonney2k	0.000001 % :D
 blackburn	it is so nice for python but I don't know about C++
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	but if we see now it is 0.1% we are happy
@sonney2k	heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: lol, gcov
 blackburn	it is already here
@sonney2k	so what is it?
 blackburn	something gnu to compute coverage
 wiking	sonney2k: :D
@sonney2k	looks like this is more like grof
@sonney2k	alright 1 test fails now :)
 blackburn	yeah I don't understand how to use it
@sonney2k	wiking, good boy, bad boy!
 wiking	sonney2k: well then good that we have unit test finally :P
 blackburn	wiking: any idea?
 wiking	sonney2k: heheh i wonder what was happening there with the max thing :)
 blackburn	about coverage
 wiking	blackburn: about.... sorry i was showering till now
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah we need them with programmers like you ;-)
* wiking hides
 wiking	sonney2k: but actually what happened in that max calculation?
 blackburn	we need to know what is tested and what is not
 wiking	blackburn: ah that's easy
 blackburn	wiking: how?
 wiking	blackburn: almost nothing is tested :D
 blackburn	wiking: I will find you
 wiking	blackburn: and kill me? :)
 blackburn	ja!
 wiking	blackburn: ok you want it per object or per object per function?
 blackburn	I want it somehow
 wiking	because the per obj is quite easy
 wiking	as you can see for each .cc you need a _unittest.cc
 wiking	so that's quite easy
 blackburn	no that's not interesting
 wiking	but i reckon that's not so nice
 wiking	i think we need an obj->func coverage
 blackburn	I found that gconv can be used with google test
 blackburn	http://meekrosoft.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/continuous-code-coverage-with-gcc-googletest-and-hudson/
@sonney2k	wiking, the cblas_idamax compute argmax_i(abs(x[i]))
 wiking	blackburn: mmm
@sonney2k	wiking, but we used it to compute max
 blackburn	blas is pure evil
@sonney2k	dangerous for negative numbers...
 wiking	sonney2k: i was totaly convinced from some doc that it's a simple max for double
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but it is not
 blackburn	http://www.netlib.org/blas/idamax.f
 blackburn	IDAMAX finds the index of element having max. absolute value.
 blackburn	wiking: never trust anything but netlib
 wiking	blackburn: yep
 wiking	i can see that now
 wiking	ok well it's good for abs_max :)
 wiking	if we'd have that
 wiking	btw: blackburn well i guess we could use that
 blackburn	wiking: yes, I'd like to try
 wiking	blackburn: but i guess some simple ctags hack could do it as well no?
@sonney2k	interestingly we use it in arg_max too
@sonney2k	but we have no test for that that could fail
* sonney2k runs away screaming
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	sonney2k: well at least we can be sure iranian missile will fail
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure of that? anything south of the equator will be mapped to north of it
@sonney2k	same east of  the null meridian -> west
@sonney2k	west <-> east
@sonney2k	scary no?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm
 blackburn	interesting what it will reach then
 blackburn	have you all seen new iranian aircraft?
@sonney2k	indeed some drones attempting to land on berlins new airport ;^)
 blackburn	http://c.img22.rian.ru/images/92138/00/921380064.jpg
 wiking	blackburn: the plastic mockup?
 blackburn	wiking: !
 blackburn	exactly
 wiking	:D
 wiking	no i haven't seen it :D
 wiking	blackburn: well let's try that gconv thingy then
 blackburn	wiking: I am trying it now
 blackburn	wiking: sonney2k: this way we can accept any patches that increase coverage
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you mean tasks for gsoc applicants?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	how demotivating :/
 blackburn	well may be
@sonney2k	porting examples over from python_modualr to other $LANG would also be valuable
 wiking	:>>>>
 blackburn	sonney2k: isn't that demotivating?
@sonney2k	blackburn, at least you see that stuff runs some real thing
@sonney2k	and maybe even with fance gfx
@sonney2k	fancy
@sonney2k	ohh boy
@sonney2k	look svm ocas is working again...
@sonney2k	all due to that isamax thing
 wiking	sonney2k: \o/
 wiking	sonney2k: megafail by me
 wiking	:(
 n4nd0	wiking, sonney2k : sorry, I had an issue with my python, but now it is fine :)
 n4nd0	wiking: Checking for Google C++ Testing Framework ... unit testing framework not detected, for unit testing please install it
 wiking	but seems not many people use shogun as nobody complained
 n4nd0	Checking for Google C++ Mocking Framework ... unit testing framework not detected, for unit testing please install it
 n4nd0	let me check configure too
 wiking	n4nd0: ok i guess it cannot find the src dir for either of those libraries
 wiking	it tries to find it under /usr/src/{gtest,gmock} by default
 wiking	if the src is somewhere else you have to specify it for the ./configure by --gmock=PATH --gtest=PATH
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :master * 0017902 / / (5 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/001790288e12ada4bd2d4956007b4f87834d84c7
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix argmax/max in sgvector
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: for float/double: isamax computes the argmax of abs(vector)
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: not the max! introduce new max_abs / arg_max_abs functions for that and
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add tests for these too.
 n4nd0	wiking: /usr/src/gtest is there
 wiking	n4nd0: where's your gmock src?
 wiking	if you dont have that you'll have to download it
 wiking	n4nd0: but still i wonder why it cannot find gtest src
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah that was weird
 n4nd0	gmock is in...
 n4nd0	/usr/include/gmock
 wiking	n4nd0: but the src?
 wiking	because those are only the headers
 wiking	n4nd0: but still need to figure out why gtest fails for u
 wiking	n4nd0: anything informative in the configure.log?
 n4nd0	wiking: does gmock dir look fine? http://pastebin.com/Vs0Da84e
 n4nd0	checking configure.log now
 wiking	n4nd0: yeah headers looks great
 n4nd0	wiking: nothing apart from what I pasted before, in the configure.log
 wiking	but you would need the src files as well: gmock-all.cc  gmock-cardinalities.cc  gmock.cc  gmock-internal-utils.cc  gmock_main.cc  gmock-matchers.cc  gmock-spec-builders.cc
 wiking	if u dont have those
 wiking	download gmock src somewhere
 wiking	and give the path for the configure script
@sonney2k	wiking, please install gmock on your buildslaves...
 wiking	sonney2k: mmm letmecheck what freebsd has
 wiking	sonney2k: i have gtest installed on ubuntu
@sonney2k	I hope I find the time to do it on all the rest and then we enable this thing
@sonney2k	but for now
@sonney2k	ZZZZZzzzz...
 wiking	but as said earlier on ubuntu
 wiking	gmock package is fucked
 wiking	so i cannot enable it :S
 blackburn	watch your language! :D
@sonney2k	wiking, then put the files manually somewhere
 blackburn	ah soeren is sleeping
 blackburn	now we can say bad words
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	jk
 wiking	sonney2k: /home/wiking/gmock-1.6.0
 wiking	sonney2k: for the ubuntu buildbot
 wiking	sonney2k: but afaik you should not run make unit-tests there
 n4nd0	wiking: I've got some python files in /usr/shar/gmock too
 wiking	sonney2k: as its doing static analyzer there
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zfc8x0NWtIE songs of sonney2k's youth
 n4nd0	no clue of cc files though
 n4nd0	wiking: ok gtest detected now
 wiking	n4nd0: cool now i think u should download gmock for yourself
 wiking	n4nd0: if the package doesn't have the src installed somewhere
 wiking	i mean the c++ src
 n4nd0	wiking: I have found the sources in a zip in AUR
 wiking	of gmock that is
 n4nd0	wiking: take a look at it
 n4nd0	http://googlemock.googlecode.com/files/gmock-1.6.0.zip
 wiking	yep
 wiking	that's what u need
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	wiking: complete install or just point in the configure to the .src files?
 wiking	n4nd0: the former one... just point to the root dir of what you've got extracted from that zip
 wiking	i mean latter
 wiking	:P
 wiking	the compilation will be done by shogun
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	wiking: let's try it out
 blackburn	what do you guys think if we make shogun a browser?
 wiking	if the ./configure finds both
 wiking	blackburn: most def :)
 wiking	n4nd0: just run make unit-tests
 wiking	that should both compile the shogun lib and try to execute the unit tests
 blackburn	we will get a lot of users by a matter of seconds
 blackburn	people would like to see how ML library changed to browser
 wiking	blackburn: i guess we'll compile it for all the mobile platforms as well :P
 n4nd0	wiking: gmock no detected still
 wiking	n4nd0: ok how do you run ./configure?
 n4nd0	wiking: a sec I think I know what it might be
 n4nd0	mmm nothing it didn't work out
 n4nd0	so I have
 n4nd0	oh shit I am idiot
 n4nd0	I still had the /usr/include/gmock from before...
 wiking	ok just paste here your ./configure line :)
 n4nd0	got it detected :)
 n4nd0	./configure --disable-optimization --interfaces=python_modular --gtest=/usr/src/gtest/ --python=python2 --gmock=/usr/src/gmock
 wiking	mm and you extracted your gmock zip to /usr/src/gmock ?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	but it is working now
 n4nd0	Checking for Google C++ Testing Framework ... yes
 n4nd0	Checking for Google C++ Mocking Framework ... yes
 wiking	heheh then you can just remove both --gtest=/usr/src/gtest/ and --gmock=/usr/src/gmock
 wiking	as it's by default looking for it at that location
 n4nd0	hehe I like to type :P
 wiking	ok well now type
 wiking	make unit-tests
 wiking	and it should do the whole thing
 wiking	and on the end see the unit test running
 n4nd0	make unit-tests is a gmock thing?
 n4nd0	make unit-tests
 n4nd0	make: Nothing to be done for `unit-tests'.
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i wonder
 wiking	ok then just do this
 wiking	cd ../tests/unit && make
 n4nd0	but I didn't make yet
 n4nd0	maybe it needs to be done
 wiking	dont worry about that
 wiking	it should invoke automatically the compilation of shogun library
 n4nd0	making in tests/unit ...
 wiking	yep
 wiking	so that'll make everything that u need for unit testing
 wiking	and then run the unit tests
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	wiking: successful make
