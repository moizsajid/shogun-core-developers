 tom__	Hi all
@wiking	hey
 tom__	A question about: HistogramIntersection Kernel
 tom__	What type of features can I use with that ?
 tom__	HashDocDot feats are derived from dot feats, does it match ?
 tom__	HistogramIntersection should use dense features, is there any way to convert string feats, (or hashdocdot feats) into dense feats ?
@wiking	tom__: mmm well maybe it'd be better to convert HistogramIntersectionKernel to support other features
 tom__	When StringFeatures refers to occurence histograms (of ngram etc ..), is it possbile to convert to dense features ?
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	haven't been working with stringFeats ...
@wiking	maybe somebody else would have an opinion on this...?

 [paladin]	Hey. I'm interested in discussing about participating in GSoC 2014. Who do I get in touch with ?
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: hey
 [paladin]	hey.
 lisitsyn	I can talk about it I think :)
 lisitsyn	is there anything you want to ask?
 [paladin]	Yeah.
 [paladin]	One. I haven't seen any official ideas page for GSoC 2014. So I was wondering what you guys had planned ?
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: we are working on possible ideas these days
 [paladin]	Two: do you guys have benchmarking methods implemented ?
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: examples of ideas are GPs, random forests, MCMC and some frameworks
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: no not really
 lisitsyn	we had one in dotfeatures iirc
 [paladin]	What about an automatic benchmarking tool ?
 lisitsyn	but not as a general practice
 lisitsyn	if you want to propose such an idea it would be welcome if we are accepted :)
 lisitsyn	however we need to think what is it and how should it be done

-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 [paladin]	Okay so should I approach when you have a page out to officially discuss ? Later ?
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: well some kind of
 lisitsyn	although it would be cool if you propose your idea in the mailing list
 lisitsyn	so we can comment etc
 [paladin]	okay. I think that would give me more time to sort of formalise it
 lisitsyn	[paladin]: sure!
 [paladin]	great. thanks.

@sonney2k	thoralf, heh
 lisitsyn	are we in that stamstststsich state?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I am
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but I only have 20 minutes before being kicked out
@sonney2k	internet here sucks big time
 lisitsyn	heh
@HeikoS	sonney2k: hi!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  hi!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I have two projects, talking to a guy about a third one
@HeikoS	I could do another one, but thats out of my time constraints ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so it seems we have enough projects ...
@HeikoS	sonney2k: thats good!
@HeikoS	I will add two descriptions soon end of weekish

@sonney2k	HeikoS, I cannot start doing stuff before next week
@sonney2k	HeikoS, internet sucks here so I am basically offline
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: where you at? ;)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, btw regarding funding - we had a paid developer at some stage. So I know that money is not the key to a OSS project's success
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, Oberwiesenthal
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: is it dirk who is a paid developer?
 lisitsyn	:P
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok no worries there is still time
 lisitsyn	ahh sonney2k having ski time?
 lisitsyn	I am zero-experienced but I tend to agree it is not about money, HeikoS sonney2k
@HeikoS	sonney2k: funding would still be nice, but yeah, money is not the thing
@HeikoS	but continuity :)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, indeed but he wasn't the only one
@HeikoS	so if we could pay sergey, that would be cool
@sonney2k	HeikoS, money != continuity
@HeikoS	sonney2k: well up to some point it is
@HeikoS	just hour wise
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: even in this case I could fail :D
@sonney2k	yes for a few months
 shogun-buildbot	build #449 of FC19 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FC19%20-%20libshogun/builds/449  blamelist: Parijat Mazumdar <mazumdarparijat@gmail.com>
@sonney2k	but then it is just work
@sonney2k	and you loose interest in doing it the way you did...
@sonney2k	but of course there are exceptions
@HeikoS	sonney2k: its worth a try
@HeikoS	but yeah, as you said, gsoc first
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you are mr. chaos(tm) anywas :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes indeed
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: isn't it the way everything should work?
 lisitsyn	chaotic!
@sonney2k	GSoC gave use much more continuity :)
 lisitsyn	I have to admit I don't get continuity word here
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, that is how our team works :D
@sonney2k	all entropy maximizers!
@HeikoS	haha
 lisitsyn	yeah sure I thought max ent is the way
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	sonney2k: still would be good to have some less new-algorithm based person working on stuff
@sonney2k	yeah we had that - it is boring and at some point you wish you would do sth else
@sonney2k	but of course this helped
@HeikoS	yeah one needs a good mix
@sonney2k	but not regarding continuity
@sonney2k	difficult
@HeikoS	and change targets every now and then
@HeikoS	I think we can only win by this :)
@sonney2k	ML people don't like non-new-algorithm stuff
@HeikoS	wiking does :)
@HeikoS	sergey too
@sonney2k	and hardcore coders get bored with lowlevel stuff
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we are not ml people ;)
@HeikoS	I dont see this so pessimistic and would see its good to try things,
@sonney2k	HeikoS, one pressing thing is getting the money btw
@HeikoS	every now and then
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sure do it
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah just reading your email
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you just should not be 100% away
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I need that money too, fincance is pressing here
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I was 100% away from everything over the last months
@HeikoS	but that wont happen anymore in the near/middle future
@HeikoS	(I hope at least)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I know
@HeikoS	kind of crazy period here
@sonney2k	just after the summit
 lisitsyn	you must feel good now
@sonney2k	pretty bad :(
@HeikoS	did not do anything else than working and sleeping
@HeikoS	I do feel free :)
@sonney2k	btw guys we have this buildbot here showing very critical valgrind errors
@sonney2k	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/165
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: how did you manage to concentrate? :D
@HeikoS	but now there is all the postponed stuff waiting  ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: well focus on one thing rather than many
@sonney2k	it is unfortunately green all the time
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I constantly fail in this
@HeikoS	sonney2k: whats the problem with that?

@HeikoS	bad bad
 lisitsyn	oh I think I have a new idea to propose
@sonney2k	they will kick me out of this lounge here in 1 min...
 lisitsyn	dictionary learning
 lisitsyn	the problme is I am not an expert in that at all
 lisitsyn	is it a problem for any of you?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: whats the most important stuff to discuss for now
 shogun-buildbot	build #450 of FC19 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FC19%20-%20libshogun/builds/450
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well get the money from previous gsoc
@sonney2k	get into this years gsoc
@sonney2k	so proposal needs to be written
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok, so we dont need more projects? just proposals?
@sonney2k	and ideas list in shape
@HeikoS	if I add two, we have some things?
@HeikoS	new mentors?
@HeikoS	neural net? variational learning?
@sonney2k	I asked many people and some of them said yes so we should be fine
@sonney2k	we have to finish it though but one thing at a time
@sonney2k	then I would say
@sonney2k	get builbots to green
@sonney2k	and criticals fixed
@sonney2k	and then release...
@HeikoS	sonney2k: did you submit an amount along with the pdf invoices you sent?
@sonney2k	and then gsoc students Q/A as usual
@sonney2k	ohh btw
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I thought I CC'ed you?!
@sonney2k	but he actually did
@sonney2k	ohh an btw workshop - > before eurypython in berlin
@sonney2k	Europython
@wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	sonney2k: phew load sof stuff
@wiking	stamtisch :)
@HeikoS	Ill try to do something little every day ;)
@wiking	or wtf :> woah i've managed :>
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sure
@HeikoS	sonney2k: no you did not, do you still find the email?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the guy attached the bill in his email
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so you have it too
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I don tknow whether I have to put a number
@HeikoS	or just the scans and they already have the sum
@sonney2k	IIRC all he wanted is that we prepend some bill to google
@HeikoS	wiking: hi there! how are things?
@wiking	HeikoS: pfff
@sonney2k	HeikoS, they have everything
@wiking	HeikoS: but thanks for asking :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, wiking is in his final phase of phd
@sonney2k	so closer to suicide as usual ;)
 lisitsyn	oh shit I should write my masters thesis
 lisitsyn	good you recalled
@sonney2k	(every phd student knows what I am talking about)
@HeikoS	oh
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	wiking: haha ;) I share your pain
@wiking	HeikoS: thnx
@sonney2k	HeikoS, then I think I should try to get shogun properly into debian
@sonney2k	we have sth in now
@sonney2k	but no python etc
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I agree
@sonney2k	HeikoS, besser82 already gave us nice fedora packages
@sonney2k	so we are in much better shape than the years before
@sonney2k	HeikoS, would be nice if wiking could take care of osx stuff like brew / macports
@sonney2k	and we need our binary packages on the website somewhere
@sonney2k	alrighty
@sonney2k	I am being kicked out
@sonney2k	see you guys
@wiking	cya
 lisitsyn	okay now people would notice my messages again :D
@wiking	:D
 thoralf	lisitsyn ;)
@wiking	lisitsyn: go and work on msc :)
@wiking	so what's with the licensing on the end
 lisitsyn	wiking: I don't know what is it about
@wiking	do we have a conclusion, or the conclusion is that we have no conclusion :)
@wiking	okok i see
 lisitsyn	okay guys any suggestions for masters thesis? :D
@HeikoS	sonney2k: see you!
 lisitsyn	I have 3 months essentially :D
@wiking	well then we should really think that if we get accepted for gsoc this year
@HeikoS	man deep mind just got bought by google
@wiking	that maybe the students should send in their stuff with different license
@wiking	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	another scary bit in their puzzle
 lisitsyn	wiking: I vote for BSD/MIT
 lisitsyn	for new code
@wiking	no it's scary how much they paid for it
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	wiking: deep mind is next door here and most people from the institute go there after phd
@wiking	lisitsyn: could go with it
@wiking	HeikoS: hehe thought so
@HeikoS	pretty cool caompany, would have wanted to go there
@HeikoS	but now....aaargh
@HeikoS	wiking: whats with this bsd change?
@HeikoS	wiking: how much work is that?
-!- zxtx [~zv@129-79-241-148.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu] has joined #shogun
 besser82	HeikoS:  a f*cking bunch
@wiking	HeikoS: well it's more waiting than
 lisitsyn	hah
@HeikoS	if we could do this kind of on the fly every now and then continously that would be great
@wiking	work actually
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah thats what I mean
@HeikoS	and we can ask all code from now to be bsd
@HeikoS	or mit
@HeikoS	or whatever
@wiking	that's not an issue
 besser82	HeikoS, lisitsyn, wiking, adrin, iglesiasg, thoralf: Hey Folks!!!
@wiking	the past code and their writers has to be contacted
@wiking	yoyo
@HeikoS	besser82: hi! :)
 thoralf	Hey Bj?rn
 lisitsyn	is there anyone else (but HeikoS) who thinks we should kinda split up to a few smaller libraries?
@HeikoS	wiking: how much automatic would that be
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: is that a gsoc project?
@wiking	HeikoS: well i've done some basic stats by git
@wiking	it's doable
 lisitsyn	this should solve licensing problem a bit
 lisitsyn	I mean we just replace parts
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, so maybe I will write an email and put it to disciussion this week
 lisitsyn	do we need massive -> bsd conversion?
@wiking	i mean the core developers can right away assign to the right license
@wiking	the problem is with contributors
@wiking	who are gone
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah I would just try things first and then see how it goes
@HeikoS	wiking: yep
@wiking	but in worst case
@HeikoS	would be good to have a map of things
@wiking	we can do a rewrite of that code
@wiking	or let's say this is a good way to throw out code
@wiking	HeikoS: mindmap? :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: what's with berlin universitaet copyrights?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah maybe later, I would first change everything thats possible and start changing new stuff
@wiking	lisitsyn: mmm has to be followed up
@HeikoS	and then discuss what to do with the rest
@HeikoS	but guys, what about gsoc, whats your status on that? project ideas? ideas page, proposals? application, who manages?
 lisitsyn	wiking: is it enough to have author will to change anything?
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes
 lisitsyn	u sure?
@wiking	lisitsyn: but of course if there's an institution connected
@wiking	lisitsyn: then u have to get the institution to sign of the change as well
 lisitsyn	haha
 lisitsyn	then gsoc 2011 work is kind of lost
@wiking	HeikoS: i've promised to write the proposal
@wiking	lisitsyn: y?
@HeikoS	wiking: on what?
 besser82	lisitsyn:  several smaller libs / plugin-stuff 4 sure!
@wiking	HeikoS: for gsoc... and put in shape the whole project ideas
 lisitsyn	besser82: good to have people on your side :D
@wiking	HeikoS: will do this till wednesday
 besser82	HeikoS:  me is mentoring SVM^bright && some cmake-based stuff
@wiking	lisitsyn: what's the problem with 2011 contribs?
@HeikoS	besser82: cool!
 lisitsyn	wiking: I mean they are all signed as berlin stuff
 lisitsyn	as soeren was in TU at the moment
@wiking	lisitsyn: well we can get somebody in berlin to sign it off
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah but there's alex and some other guys still there
 lisitsyn	ah okay if it works I don't mind
-!- benibadman [~benibadma@port-92-206-75-57.dynamic.qsc.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
@wiking	so i dont really think that we cannot get somebody in TU to sign of a piece of paper
 lisitsyn	I have absolutely no clue how this works
@wiking	lisitsyn: i've checked up
 lisitsyn	cool
 lisitsyn	then we are ok
 lisitsyn	:)
@wiking	we need basically a statement
@wiking	from the parties that they are ok with the licensing change
@wiking	that's all
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking we can just ask and see then
@wiking	it's not rocket science
@wiking	ok
@wiking	so fucking let's go with BSD 2 liners
@HeikoS	naywhayare: are you interested in having another project on this inter project comparison stuff?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah I agree on that
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'll scetch up the statement for that
@wiking	that we can send around to license holders in shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: cool, maybe use the vlc stuff as inspiration
@wiking	and then we are good
@wiking	HeikoS: indeed
@wiking	HeikoS: get funding :)
@HeikoS	wiking: important part would be to maintain answers decisions and what parts are missing
@wiking	if docker got 15M usd...
@wiking	fuck man that pissed me off :)

@wiking	lisitsyn: it's money that i have to spend for associations/fundation, i.e. nonprofit
@wiking	otherwise it's lost money
@HeikoS	wiking: wherefrom?
 lisitsyn	heh yeah interesting ;)
@wiking	because then the state will eat that money
@wiking	so i rather give that money for something i know...
@wiking	HeikoS: have a small company that has to do taxes
@HeikoS	wiking: I see
@HeikoS	very cool!
@wiking	HeikoS: and i can assign freely 1% of my tax to nonprofit shiatz
@HeikoS	hopefully next month we are set
@wiking	as said if i dont assign it to somebody
@wiking	then it's just lost in the big state budget
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	let's hope we are still in time
@wiking	i've talked with vojtech
@wiking	about some qp project
@wiking	it'll be a huge project
@wiking	i dont know if anybody will be up for that task
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	that would be cool
@wiking	btw i could do gsoc this year (apparently i still have student status :DDD
@HeikoS	haha :)
@HeikoS	you should rather mentor two students ;)
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	figured
@wiking	ok so lisitsyn r u going to lead the modularization ? :)
@wiking	i mean if we get into gsoc
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah I think it would work for me
@wiking	cool
@wiking	that should have a prio among the slots
@wiking	imho
@wiking	if there's a good student up for that task
 lisitsyn	wiking: I realized I am rather a gay^W^W a software developer than machine learning guy
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: :D
@wiking	btw the whole story with dptrs would be still required even if we do modularization?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I think d-ptr stuff is useful anyways
 besser82	wiking:  dtpr would be good in some parts, yes  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn:  :D
@wiking	i guess we would still benefit a lot from it
 lisitsyn	I believe once we get better compile time
@wiking	for the swig interfaces
@wiking	or?
 lisitsyn	wiking: don't know
 lisitsyn	we will see
 besser82	wiking:  yes, swig would be a cleaner solution  then
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah i think the generated cxx would be heaps smaller
@wiking	HeikoS: wha't swith that view thing atm?
 besser82	wiking: and generation of them cxx wouldn't take 1.5GBytes each anymore  :-P

 lisitsyn	oh guys guys
@HeikoS	wiking: the guy did not finish it unfortunately
 lisitsyn	I have an idea
@wiking	HeikoS: what's missing?
@HeikoS	wiking: the solution was nice though
@HeikoS	should not be hard to finish it
 lisitsyn	lets put whole shogun code to one .h
@wiking	HeikoS: if u tell me what's missing i could give it a go
@HeikoS	wiking: some playing around with it to see it works and fix copy constructors of some feature classes
@wiking	lisitsyn: !!!
 lisitsyn	what's your bet on required RAM?
@wiking	HeikoS: indeed
@HeikoS	wiking: have a look at the current PR of the guy
@wiking	HeikoS: will do
@HeikoS	wiking: and then change the x-validation class to use it as a test case (and write unit tests :)
@HeikoS	and then it should be ready to be used by others
 lisitsyn	I think 30gb should be the number :D
@HeikoS	and if you dont change the copy-by-reference objects, it is threadsafe
@wiking	HeikoS: ok so not muc :)
@wiking	HeikoS: well i might just skip xvalidation
@wiking	HeikoS: but test it in other places :PPP

 lisitsyn	may be I could mentor it somehow
 lisitsyn	at least some ksvd
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	lisitsyn: we can steal the code :)
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	everything is already implemented
@wiking	'steal' = opensource
@wiking	yeah so that shouldn't be a biggie
@wiking	i mean we can put together such a slot as well
@wiking	where u dont need too much of a haxor skill
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	rather just do fast integration of some crucial basic algo
 lisitsyn	cause plugins is a hardcore thing
@wiking	that are atm missing from shogun
@wiking	yeah that's like pretty fucking crayz
 lisitsyn	we ain't gonna have a student for that
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	i can come as a student as i told :DDD
@wiking	but imo i wont have time
@wiking	:<
@wiking	thoralf: i see it's rather a longer fix
@wiking	thoralf: there were a lot of code redundancy in the lib* implementation
@wiking	and as it's a matlab -> c port
@wiking	i wouldn't be too surprised of such 'little' bug

 thoralf	wiking: Let me look to the other classes if they have similar issues...
@wiking	thoralf: lib*bmrm are quite having the same codebase
@wiking	they only have minor differences
 thoralf	Hmm, handling of beta is quite different in libp3bm and libncbm.
 thoralf	But libppbm.cpp seems to suffer the same issue.
 thoralf	line 265
 naywhayare	HeikoS: sure; we have the framework in place and it could definitely be improved
 naywhayare	oh, he's not even here.  I should check first ...
 thoralf	wiking: Thanks for pointing that out.
@wiking	naywhayare: which/what fw?
@wiking	thoralf: nw... in the past i've hacked a bit that code
@wiking	to make it a bit more shogun
@wiking	ready
@wiking	:P
 naywhayare	wiking: last year as a GSoC project mlpack had a student who made an automatic benchmarking system
 naywhayare	I met HeikoS at the mentor summit and we talked about how it would be useful for both of our libraries -- or really all ML libraries in general
 naywhayare	here's the last run of benchmarks we had... http://www.mlpack.org/benchmark.html
 naywhayare	anyway, it needs better documentation, better details, probably a better interface
 naywhayare	I think HeikoS was interested in adapting the system so it could be used by shogun
@wiking	oh cool
@wiking	naywhayare: is it hardwired with mlpack ?
 naywhayare	I also need to rebuild the benchmarks for your latest release but a paper deadline is on the 31st so it won't be done until after that...
 naywhayare	no, it's library-agnostic
@wiking	great
 naywhayare	what the framework really is is just a big python script that runs things and compares how long they take
 naywhayare	it has a configuration file that defines what to run, what datasets to use, and how to run it
 naywhayare	and then it has little python scripts individually written for each library's implementation of each method
-!- iglesiasg [~iglesiasg@524AE0A7.cm-4-3d.dynamic.ziggo.nl] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@wiking	naywhayare: and python runs like a binary or if there's a python interface u use that?
@wiking	naywhayare: cool it seems there'a lot of stuff we need to fix :P
@wiking	in shogun
@wiking	i'm just checking GMM results
@wiking	naywhayare: do u have somewhere the code released?
 naywhayare	wiking: yeah, here's the repo link...
 naywhayare	http://svn.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/mlpack/conf/jenkins-conf/benchmark/
 naywhayare	it wasn't really part of mlpack so we put it in our configuration directory for our build server
 naywhayare	and we have it all integrated with the build server so that it's easy to run tests
 naywhayare	here's some further documentation
 naywhayare	http://www.mlpack.org/trac/wiki/AutomaticBenchmark
@wiking	ok cool
@wiking	i'll try to run this myself
 naywhayare	like I said it's not completely polished
 naywhayare	we did our best to write the scripts for other libraries to use them as well as possible
@wiking	no worries
 thoralf	wiking: libppbm has the same issue - just proven it in a unit test.
@wiking	thoralf: \o/
 naywhayare	the cover tree is not used for shogun k-nearest-neighbors because john langford's code has a bug he has yet to fix and it returns incorrect results (I think I mentioned this in here a while back; he still hasn't fixed it)
@wiking	naywhayare: maybe we could start a separate repo for this on github?
 naywhayare	also, when you see '-' instead of 'failure' for the results, it means the test wasn't run for that particular dataset
@wiking	naywhayare: and then we can get travis to do all the testing? :P
 naywhayare	that's just a configuration file issue and I'm in the process of fixing them little by little...
@wiking	naywhayare: how long did it take for u to run the benchmark
 naywhayare	heh.  the mlpack one takes two weeks
 naywhayare	the other libraries tend to take 3-5 days
@wiking	oh woah :D
 naywhayare	with mlpack we do memory profiling too
@wiking	naywhayare: with?
 naywhayare	massif/valgrind
@wiking	naywhayare: do u use some fancy malloc library or the base system?
 naywhayare	just valgrind, I'm not 100% sure on the details
@wiking	ok
 naywhayare	if you click the rightmost button for a method, then you can open up the 'memory results'
 naywhayare	and it shows you memory usage for mlpack during the run of the algorithm
@wiking	i see
@wiking	cool
@wiking	would be great to have that for all the libraries of coursE :P
 naywhayare	yeah; we did what we could, but time is so little that it's really hard to keep the effort going
@wiking	but then again that's future
 naywhayare	I have enough trouble just keeping up to date with the five or six libraries we do test
@wiking	naywhayare: totally understand
 naywhayare	because every time a new release happens I have to recompile it on my test system, then ensure the python scripts still work
 naywhayare	...then wait 3-5 days for the results to be done :)
@wiking	naywhayare: do u think we could get a separate repo for this
@wiking	?
@wiking	so that anybody can contribute easily
 naywhayare	yeah, I mean, it's open-source.  =)
@wiking	i'm sure ppl here in shogun would be keen to contribute into it
 naywhayare	ideally the student should own the github repo, since it was his work and he knows the most about it
@wiking	naywhayare: yeah no i mean that we could say that we create an official repo at github for it
 naywhayare	definitely
@wiking	and then jsut have collaborators for the same repo
@wiking	and then PRs can be sent etc
@wiking	naywhayare: r u still in touch with the student?
 naywhayare	I'm getting in touch with him about it (his irc nick is 'marcus_zoq' and he hangs out in #mlpack or you can pm him); I'll let you know what he says
 naywhayare	yeah, we still talk regularly, which is good
@wiking	great
@wiking	could u please ask him if he would do this?
 shogun-buildbot	build #46 of deb4 - python3 is complete: Failure [failed test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb4%20-%20python3/builds/46  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 naywhayare	I just did, don't worry =)
@wiking	cool great!
 naywhayare	really github is a better place anyway than hidden somewhere inside our jenkins configuration
@wiking	heheh yeah
@wiking	just with a small link to that page in README.md
@wiking	and that's all
@wiking	after that issues and PRs will fly anyways
 naywhayare	we submitted the project to the MLOSS workshop but the reviewers bashed it because they were more interested in comparing the accuracy of algorithms instead of the runtime
 naywhayare	whereas for the most part we try to ensure that we are benchmarking the exact same algorithms against each other
@wiking	hehehh yeah man
@wiking	i mean reviewers are like a joke sometimes
@wiking	i mean there's like 8 out of 10 papers
 naywhayare	nah, it wasn't a bad review, his points were valid, but sort of missed the point of what we were doing a bit
@wiking	where they compare algos
@wiking	but then u know that they fine tuned the last bit of their algo in the paper
@wiking	while the ones they used for comparison
@wiking	just used as is (default parameters etc)
 naywhayare	yeah, naturally.  it's really difficult to get a clear picture like that
@wiking	so really a thing like this would be great to have
@wiking	jsut would be great to automate a lot of part of it
@wiking	i mean the test generation
 naywhayare	so you can use kernel PCA for denoising and alex smola's big paper on it from 1999 has some awesome results... but that paper doesn't mention that when you do image denoising with kpca you still end up with outliers that have incredibly poor quality
@wiking	:P
@wiking	alex alex
@wiking	i wonder where's he now
 naywhayare	that was a thing I learned this weekend.  overall, the average reconstructed image quality is great!  but there are just some terrible outliers sometimes.  I wonder if anyone's investigated that
@wiking	used to be in canberra
 naywhayare	either CMU or Google or Yahoo
 naywhayare	I met him at ICML... his poster was next to mine
 naywhayare	I thought that would be great for the publicity of my poster
 naywhayare	but actually everyone just talked to him and not me :(
@wiking	heheheheheh
@wiking	yeah usual
@wiking	sorry to hear that though
@wiking	btw how to u store the results?
@wiking	i mean is it stored in a db or something?
 naywhayare	yeah, sqlite db
@wiking	ok cool
@wiking	so basically on the end u can generate historical data as well
@wiking	right?
 naywhayare	yeah, although I don't think we have the support to do that well
 naywhayare	not right now at least
@wiking	yeah sure
 naywhayare	but it can be done; there's just nothing in there that will generate those graphs
@wiking	but if it's stored with a timestamp
@wiking	it's really just up to a php/python script to do that
 naywhayare	http://big.cc.gt.atl.ga.us/ there's our build server.  if you open the 'z benchmark' category then you can see each job that we run
 naywhayare	so when a new release happens, I update it on the system that will be running on the benchmarks (compile with -O3 and whatever), then click 'start job' on jenkins
@wiking	cool
@wiking	great stuff
@wiking	i think there's a lot of great stuff that can be done with this
@wiking	i mean on the end if u think about it... if this benchmark gets more wide
@wiking	library releasers will themselves generate the output
@wiking	of their new release
 naywhayare	yeah, I agree
 naywhayare	but again it gets really difficult to compare algorithms sometimes
 naywhayare	I can compare nearest-neighbor pretty easily because it's exact, but... do I compare it with kd-trees, or with the library's default trees?
@wiking	well of course
 naywhayare	is the goal of the benchmark to show what a typical user might actually write in code, or to show the actual capabilities of the library?  it gets difficult to answer the question cleanly
@wiking	but there's always going to be problems like that
 naywhayare	because it may be that while I can use mlpack's AllkNN object, it's 5x as fast if I write a far more complex use of some other class
@wiking	but we dont want to solve everything with this benchmark
@wiking	rather to show at least basic stuff
@wiking	and compare them
 naywhayare	yeah.  I see those types of problems as a potential source of arguments that I really want to avoid.  I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings :)
@wiking	nono i mean i think everybody understands this
 naywhayare	there definitely needs to be a lot of clarification on what exactly each benchmark is doing, because it's unclear right now (for instance it just says "ALLKNN")
@wiking	but this is good for everybody both users and library developers
@wiking	at least get the bigger picture
 naywhayare	it's super useful for an internal mlpack development tool, though
 naywhayare	true
@wiking	so it's really good ... only that we need to get some more people on board
@wiking	but i think that will not be a problem
 naywhayare	yeah.  I haven't had the time that I really need to put into this to make it as nice as I'd like it to be
 naywhayare	anyway a few good GSoC students can get a lot done :)
@wiking	well dont try to do all yourselves :)
@wiking	just put together a repo for it
@wiking	and fire up the issues
 naywhayare	yeah
@wiking	i think things will get started
 naywhayare	my hope is that Marcus will want to run that
 naywhayare	after all, it's his work :)
@wiking	heheh yeah
@wiking	naywhayare: the good thing would be to generate a standard API where u can submit your results
@wiking	via http
 naywhayare	I haven't yet approached the scikit-learn guys.  I told myself I'd do that when I had time but it looks like I'll never actually have time ever again
 naywhayare	yeah, but the benchmarks aren't useful if they're not run on the same system
@wiking	yeah
 naywhayare	which is why we limit our runs to one specific system
@wiking	but one can run the whole test
@wiking	on another system
 naywhayare	ah, yeah
@wiking	that's useful as well
@wiking	then u see what's the difference between machine A and machine B
@wiking	there's tons of things that could be done with this
@wiking	so let's get marcus on board :)
 naywhayare	yeah.  making a good interface to be able to actually parse all that data is the really tricky part
 naywhayare	or, I'm bad at interfaces :)
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	i mean honestly it'll be a great thing if this gets picked up around 2015
@wiking	that's my optimistic opinion :P
 naywhayare	:)
@wiking	there's still a lot to work on, but i believe everybody would be interested in this if it would get a little bit more attention
@wiking	:P
 naywhayare	sonney2k pointed out that they tried a similar thing some years ago with http://www.mldata.org but did not see widespread adoption
@wiking	one never knows when things go haywire :P

@wiking	ehehhe
@wiking	naywhayare: yeah like with obama and change, right? :D
@wiking	in retrospect that was like one of the biggest scam of the states :)
 naywhayare	in a country as big as ours (or really any big country) it's very easy to be cynical about politics because a single person's opinions can't really effect any change.  which is very frustrating
@wiking	ehheheh
 naywhayare	on a very local level, though, like a neighborhood / city level, I've had good interactions with local politicians
@wiking	well things are everywhere the same...
@wiking	i bet there's no one single person here who could tell the opposite
 naywhayare	hah, probably
@wiking	whenever i meet somebody from another country
@wiking	there's one single thing that everybody has in common
@wiking	things are not going well in politics :)
 naywhayare	hah
@wiking	i remember meeting this guy from brasil tell me stories of his own politicans, and in the meanwhile i was like 'yeah i know the story, they did the same...'
@wiking	so it's all the same imo
@wiking	i bet iglesiasg could share some very positive stuff from the royal family of spain :PPPPP
 naywhayare	I was in spain recently, I thought it was really nice :)

 thoralf	wiking: Err.  I found a funny bug, that actually has no effect, but maybe you've got an idea how to fix it:
 thoralf	every lib*bm defines a BufSize
 thoralf	When calling any solver, the "local" version is used.
 thoralf	But when calling libbmrm::clean_icp() and adding an assertion there, the libbmrm-version is used, no matter from which solver it's been called.
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	that's most probably a bug introduced by me
@wiking	because before that the code was just copy pasted among the 3 .cpp
 thoralf	lol
@wiking	so i wanted to remove some redundancy
@wiking	but then i guess i've made there a mistake
 thoralf	Actually is has no effect, but it's irritating as soon as you use BufSize from somewhere else. ;)
@wiking	sorry for that
