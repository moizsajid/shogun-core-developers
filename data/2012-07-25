 yoo	dense, string, any ..
 blackburn	well in case of dense
 blackburn	features->get_feature_matrix().display_matrix("feature_matrix");
 yoo	allright
 yoo	thanks
 yoo	I have my own function then for printing string features
 blackburn	string is a little more complex - you iterate from 0 to features->get_num_vectors() and get and print strings inside
 yoo	yes I have that
 yoo	just wanna to understand to way iterator works but I loosing my french in that
 yoo	by the way .. can you explain me the purpose of CMulticlassMultipleOutput ?
 blackburn	yoo: heh
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	to support top k outputs
 blackburn	i.e. if you have 50 classes and you want to store top 5 predictions
 yoo	allright
 yoo	I am suffering of the lack of c++ example towards to python modular ^^
 blackburn	yoo: feel free to contribute ;)
 blackburn	yoo: it is much easier to use shogun from python
 yoo	sure I did a little  bit with mkl and cross valid example :p
 yoo	blackburn: yes but lots of little modification have to be made on c++
 blackburn	I am open for good ideas
 yoo	blackburn: for example in crossvalid and multiclass: cannot get the average confusion matrix after many crossvalid runs ..
 yoo	I tried to add this but thats not trivial to consider multiclasslabels for base crossvalidation object
 yoo	see what I mean ?
 blackburn	yeah
 yoo	sorry its late my english is going down ..
 blackburn	isn't it native for you?
 yoo	no
 blackburn	I thought it is :)
 yoo	I would like to ass more evaluation for multiclass
 yoo	-ss +dd :p
 blackburn	yeah we can ass some
 yoo	=)
 blackburn	as for confusion matrix
 yoo	confusion matrix after Xvalidation and EER for intra class could be fun )?
 blackburn	I think one way is to extend it using msoutput
 blackburn	what is EER?
 yoo	equal error rate

 yoo	for each class in multiclass evaluation

 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	yoo: how to compute it?
-!- needsch175 [~user@ip-176-198-229-75.unitymediagroup.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 yoo	the same way you compute ROC curve
 blackburn	so ROC one vs rest?
 yoo	yep
 blackburn	I wanted to add that too
 yoo	=)
 yoo	nice
 yoo	I ll be back tommorow to discuss this if you want some help
 yoo	msoutput should be the right way
 blackburn	it is pretty easy actually
 blackburn	I think
 blackburn	I'll do that a little later
 blackburn	ahhh
 yoo	I will follow this to better understand shougunlib
 blackburn	one problem is here though
 blackburn	let me check
 yoo	btw I never succeed in passing msoutput in evaluate function without strange outputs ...
 yoo	and seg fault but maybe I mentioned it already before
 blackburn	do you have that example still?
 yoo	which one ?
 blackburn	segfaulting one
 yoo	ah
 yoo	let me check
 yoo	I just use this one http://pastebin.com/c7wKje0H
 yoo	and add msoutput object in evaluate
 yoo	think to change the inputs
 blackburn	yoo: hmm it works here
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	okay my bad probably
 blackburn	yoo: will commit a fix in a few mins
 yoo	)
 yoo	good night then, see you tomorrow
 blackburn	yoo: what is you are applying shogun for?
 yoo	machine learning =)
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	okay good night
 yoo	school project in action recognition
 yoo	apply to face expression mostly
 blackburn	school like high school?
 blackburn	:)
 yoo	yes I am 13 y old
 blackburn	no way
 yoo	coded my first neural nets at 11
 yoo	=)
 yoo	see ya, good night
 blackburn	hard to believe but you would become youngest shogun user ever :D
 yoo	just joking
 yoo	+
 blackburn	exactly

 n4nd0	someone available to help me out?
 koen-shogun	the question would be... with what?
 n4nd0	koen-shogun: no idea about why this seg fault happens http://pastebin.com/t6vPxi9T
 pluskid	n4nd0: it might be caused by some memory error, wild pointers or anything terrible... maybe run with valgrind might give some hint?
 n4nd0	pluskid: it doesn't seg fault with valgrind
 n4nd0	pluskid: do you think that reading valgrind's trace can give me a clue about it in any case?
 pluskid	does valgrind report any memory leak or something?
 pluskid	if valgrind says some pointers are used before initialized, or some memory are written out of bound, etc. it might be the cause of the problem
 n4nd0	I have some Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) and Invalid write of size ...
 n4nd0	I am going to investigate
 pluskid	n4nd0: good luck then, I'll be right back (for supper :))
 n4nd0	pluskid: thank you! I don't have the habit to use valgrind to check seg faults, but to look for memory leaks
-!- needsch [~user@ip-176-198-229-75.unitymediagroup.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 n4nd0	pluskid: problem detected and solved :)
 droopy	cool :^)
 n4nd0	a couple of errors doing arithmetic with indices
 n4nd0	pluskid: thank you again!
 pluskid	n4nd0: cool!
 koen-shogun	what you can do to find uninitialized memory: during compilation define -DMALLOC_PERTURB_=69
 koen-shogun	this will initialize all memory allocated using malloc with 69, instead of being uninitialized
 koen-shogun	can shake out some memory bugs quite easily
 n4nd0	koen-shogun: thank you for that
 n4nd0	this one was a problem related to writing out of bounds though
 n4nd0	I will be back later, bye!

 wiking	blackburn: why wouldn't it throw
 wiking	it throws :)
 blackburn	wiking: well at least it works ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you run your blas benchmark on optimized blas?
 blackburn	sonney2k: atlas
@sonney2k	or just the crap that gets installed?
@sonney2k	well atlas selfcompiled?
 blackburn	sonney2k: installed atlas
@sonney2k	or the standard atlas
@sonney2k	ok then
@sonney2k	then it is the same as basic loop
 blackburn	sonney2k: let me share code
@sonney2k	you need to compile blas
@sonney2k	yes let me try this
 blackburn	furthermore may be you will fix something in test that can be unfair
@sonney2k	what did you compute btw?
 blackburn	sonney2k: dot
 blackburn	https://gist.github.com/3178664
 blackburn	sonney2k: first one is to power up my cpu :D :D
 blackburn	we have no step back actually - I already told eigen team we use they stuff :D
 blackburn	#define EIGEN_YES_I_KNOW_SPARSE_MODULE_IS_NOT_STABLE_YET
 blackburn	lol
@sonney2k	blackburn, arg I recently updated atlas and don't will have to compile it again...
@sonney2k	that can take ages
@sonney2k	blackburn, current output
@sonney2k	 elapsed 2973.500000 clocks
@sonney2k	blas elapsed 3006.500000 clocks
@sonney2k	loop elapsed 3031.500000 clocks
@sonney2k	eigen elapsed 3006.000000 clocks
 blackburn	well pretty same
 blackburn	they all are
@sonney2k	yeah no difference
@sonney2k	I think dot is not the best op
 blackburn	sonney2k: I measured it because we heavy rely on it
@sonney2k	sth like matrix matrix mul or vector woudl be better
@sonney2k	blackburn, but measuring time diff with clock() is also not so good
 blackburn	matrix matrix is rare here in shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: gettimeofday?
@sonney2k	true
 blackburn	I failed to recall the best way
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	ahh I totally forgot about renameing Ctime functions
 blackburn	sonney2k: after we add -I/usr/include/eigen3 I have a lot of warnings
 blackburn	any idea why they haven't been there before?
