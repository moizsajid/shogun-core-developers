@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah I know (you switch topics every 5 minutes so it must be you :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: well, sorry :)
 blackburn	http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L(w,\xi)%20=%20\frac{1}{2}%20\sum_m%20\|w_m\|^2%20+%20C%20\sum_i%20\xi_i%20+%20\sum_m%20\sum_i%20\alpha_i^m%20(\langle%20w_{y_i},x_i\rangle%20-%20\langle%20w_m,x_i%20\rangle%20-%201%20-%20\delta_{y_i,m}%20-%20\xi_i\rangle)%20+%20\sum_i%20\beta_i%20\xi_i
@sonney2k	gsomix, submit what you have then I will try to have a look at the remaining examples tomorrow
@sonney2k	gsomix, always note that you are not alone - when you get stuck ask!
 blackburn	sonney2k: is d/d(w_m) of \sum_m ||w_m||^2 actually equal to 2 \sum_m ||w_m||?
 blackburn	a bit tricky
@sonney2k	blackburn, no b in that formula?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, C-S makes no use of B
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw did you know that there are really strong relations between crammer-singer and SO svm?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	I was happy to know it
@sonney2k	same idea
@sonney2k	or better SO extends this idea...
 gsomix	sonney2k, thx. of course, I'm not alone. blackburn  lives just on one floor above. :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: is it what we discussed yesterday a bit?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes you made me think about it
@sonney2k	gsomix, he doesn't need much sleep so feel free to wake him up at any time ;-)
 shogun-buildbot	build #390 of ruby_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/ruby_modular/builds/390
 blackburn	LOL
@sonney2k	blackburn, 2 || w_m|| you mean
 blackburn	actually it is rather difficult to catch me there
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: where is sum?
@sonney2k	derivative?
 blackburn	I am confused with derivative of sum
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	shouldn't it be zero for all w_i  i!=m
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	hahaha
 blackburn	haha
@sonney2k	maybe you choose some other sub index
 blackburn	I got it
 blackburn	sonney2k: remember I told you about ECOC SVM?
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think it could be a great idea
 blackburn	I asked vojtech and he agreed
 blackburn	idea is to extend any MC formulation
 blackburn	in means of ECOC
@sonney2k	now I don't know what you are talking about
 blackburn	yes, yes, I'll describe
 blackburn	sonney2k: recall s.t. in structural svm
@sonney2k	we just received the first student application!
@sonney2k	(officially submitted via gsoc melange)
 blackburn	F is the same as in C-S, but \delta(y_i,y) is code distance (say hamming)
 blackburn	<w_yi,xi> - <w_m,x_i> >= hamming distance - \xi_i
 blackburn	sonney2k: crazy, is it someone you know already?
 n4nd0	harshit said he was planning to start quite early with it ...
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
@sonney2k	you all should - this way you can get feedback
 n4nd0	but not directly to submit via melange right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: maybe mail it to you or something?
 blackburn	n4nd0: why not?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you can alwasy update until the deadline
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	ah ok, forgot about that!
 n4nd0	then I think it is the most comfortable thing for all
 blackburn	sonney2k: last thing before I leave - is my idea clear for you?
@sonney2k	and we (mentors) are being spammed like hell too :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes - I have no feeling though how it will change the learned result and if it will be useful
 blackburn	sonney2k: no serious change
 blackburn	but something similar to GMNPSVM
 blackburn	scaling mostly
 blackburn	while ECOC is more disbalanced than OvR it may impact
 blackburn	sonney2k: I gave this idea to my gf to derive dual task and stucked myself :D
 blackburn	that's why I asked
@sonney2k	poor gf :)
@sonney2k	weird way of showing appreciation
 blackburn	hahahah
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn	well she has to come up with some great bachelor work, right? ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: my paper on sign recognition is almost ready btw http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/rsr_paper.pdf
 blackburn	take a look on that funny characters lol
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok so what you would hope for is that e.g. hamming code is more robust than ovr code above?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: first shogun mentioning paper in russian ever
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is so funny that this is pure russian :)
@sonney2k	ahh english abstract :)
@sonney2k	let me try to decipher how much I understand from the russian one :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I bet not much ;)
@sonney2k	haha maschina opornich vectorow :)
 blackburn	yes that is svm
@sonney2k	never heard of anyone translating 'SVM' to german
@sonney2k	it would be Stuetzvektormaschine
 blackburn	hahahah
@sonney2k	which sounds incredibly funny
@sonney2k	blackburn, why do you publish in russian?
 blackburn	sonney2k: cause it is a useless crap
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	when I came last year to Spain after studying some machine learning at KTH I herad a professor talking about MVS
@sonney2k	n4nd0, MVS?
 n4nd0	I think he said it like three times until I realized it was the short for SVM in Spanish :)
@sonney2k	SVMs?
 n4nd0	M?quinas de Vectores Soporte
 blackburn	ohohhoh
 blackburn	oloooooool
@sonney2k	bahh
 n4nd0	I really didn't know what they were talking about when the said it
@sonney2k	I guess wikipedia has it all
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's the difficult question why I publish in russian
@sonney2k	https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1quinas_de_vectores_de_soporte
@sonney2k	https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2

@sonney2k	???????????
 blackburn	sonney2k: chervonenkis used to call SVM as it is in wiki
 blackburn	V-C one you know
@sonney2k	well I guess russians have a good reason
 n4nd0	hahaha it is even in Swedish
@sonney2k	:)
 n4nd0	I bet the people in the department here have not heard it either
@sonney2k	anyway seriously bed time for me now
@sonney2k	cu all
 blackburn	see you
 n4nd0	good night
 blackburn	for me too probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess main answer is this paper just supports my bachelor's work and contains nothing really new
 blackburn	so it would fit only to some paid journals or local russian journal like this one

 blackburn	good night
 gsomix	blackburn, "Hey you" is the Pink Floyd's song.

 gsomix	sorry for commit "Merge branch 'master'..."
 gsomix	good night, guys
 n4nd0	good night!
 gsomix	tomorrow I will have a day full of theoretical mechanics. =____=
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	good luck with that ;)

 gsomix	hi
 n4nd0	gsomix: hey!
 n4nd0	gsomix: do you think you can help me a moment with git?
 gsomix	n4nd0, let's try. however, i sometimes experience problems with it.
 n4nd0	gsomix: so I was on the point of doing a pull request
 n4nd0	but it didn't allow me to push before pulling first
 n4nd0	so I fetched shogun's repo and rebased it
 n4nd0	and later I pushed
 n4nd0	and it has turned out to be like this
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/commits/multiclass_1vs1?page=1
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@59.177.203.139] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	you can see that lot of the commits are done twice :(
 n4nd0	one authored by me and the other the original
 n4nd0	and now if I try to pull request
 n4nd0	it understands that I am pushing all that stuff as new
 n4nd0	not just the changes I have done but also the changes I got when I rebased
 n4nd0	do you see what I mean?
 gsomix	hmm
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.230] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	harshit_: hey! yesterday we spoke a bit with sonney2k about deep learning and stuff, I suggest you to check the irclogs
 n4nd0	if you have not already done so of course :)
 harshit_	okay i'll have a look at it
 harshit_	actually i am in my class right now, so i'll look at it in an hour or so..
 n4nd0	sure, no problem, they will remain there ;)
 harshit_	and thanks for talking dude
 harshit_	:)
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.230] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 gsomix	n4nd0, unfortunately, I have no ideas about it.
 gsomix	i will try to appeal to blackburn.
 n4nd0	gsomix: no worries man! I just fixed it :)
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/commits/multiclass_1vs1 so nice again :)
 n4nd0	gsomix: thank you very much anyway for taking a look to it ;)
 gsomix	n4nd0, oh, ok.
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.128.91] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	n4nd0, tell me what you did, please.
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	what's up
 gsomix	blackburn, hi
 blackburn	hi
 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: yo
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	:>>
 blackburn	gsomix: please rebase your pull request up to latest master
 blackburn	and push it again
 blackburn	git push --force origin if needed
 n4nd0	blackburn: that was the trick I had to use git push --force
 n4nd0	blackburn: why does that happen?
 blackburn	n4nd0: what exactly?
 n4nd0	blackburn: that we need to use --force after rebasing
 blackburn	n4nd0: origin at github becomes unsynchronized with your local git
 n4nd0	n4nd0: aham, I see
 blackburn	actually it shouldn't require force anytime
 n4nd0	blackburn: fuck, talking to me again
 n4nd0	I had to do it before, at the beginning I avoided it but I almost screwed my branch
 blackburn	I don't get why it can't fast-forward it though
 wiking	blackburn: don't force it
 wiking	n4nd0: don't force it
 wiking	you'll fuck up your commit history...
 wiking	and then people following you will have problems
 wiking	so rather try a rebase
 wiking	and if that does not work
 n4nd0	wiking: how should we do it then?
 wiking	do a merge
 n4nd0	wiking: ok I see
 n4nd0	wiking: I did the rebase but later it didn't allow me to push to my branch because of this non-fast-forward not allowed
 n4nd0	wiking: so when that happens, better to merge?
 wiking	well
 wiking	first try a git pull
 wiking	so if you did rebase and it did not allow you to have a git push after that
 wiking	try a git pull
 wiking	it'll try to do a simple merge
 wiking	and then after that try a git push
 blackburn	hah, that makes more sense, agree
 n4nd0	ok, thank you guys :)
 wiking	no worries
 blackburn	actually I think force is required only in case of wrong rebasing
 blackburn	it should work as fast-forward thing..
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have new news about one-vs-one
 blackburn	yes?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I had to change a couple of things more because the seg faults persisted https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/commit/b0d1a28229aba6604bc325a4fec3aab6bf5900bc
 n4nd0	the features in m_machines were NULL at training
 n4nd0	I fixed that with the changes in MulticlassMachine:89
 blackburn	hmm
 n4nd0	and the other thing I had to do, I don't like that much how it's though is MulticlassMachine:68
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am afraid line 90 is wrong
 blackburn	consider case data=NULL and m_features was set before
 blackburn	and train() is called
 blackburn	it will init train machine with NULL
 n4nd0	but init train machine doesn't set anything if data is NULL
 n4nd0	it just refreshes the las set features for m_machines

 romovpa	hi there, I want to participate in gsoc. I should demonstrate my familiarity with git and ability to build the sources
 romovpa	is there somebody who tell me how to do that?
 romovpa	hmm..?
 n4nd0	hey romovpa
 n4nd0	first you should fork the repo in github, checkout the source, get a bit used to it ...
 n4nd0	so you can work on something and submit a small patch to the project! :)
 n4nd0	if you and idea you'd like to do for this patch, it is ok then
 romovpa	I have already forked and touched it
 n4nd0	romovpa: good!
 n4nd0	so would you like to contribute with something in special?
 romovpa	here is my small patch: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/331
 n4nd0	that one is already merged
 n4nd0	good then
 romovpa	hmm... should I do anything more?
 n4nd0	should??
 n4nd0	I mean it's up to you :)
 romovpa	ok, =) thanks
 romovpa	Let it be my success report (I'm filling up my application now)
 n4nd0	romovpa: I hope you didn't take that wrong
 n4nd0	good luck with it
 n4nd0	may I ask what project are you applying for?
 gsomix	romovpa, hello from Russia.
 romovpa	I am going to implement a bundle method solver for SO-SVM
 romovpa	gsomix: hello, could we know each other?
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok lets check
 gsomix	romovpa, i do not think so.
 n4nd0	blackburn: so what did you say before that could go wrong? something that was getting null
 blackburn	ok let me describe logic
 blackburn	m_features/m_kernel is always a state
 blackburn	so then you set features/kernel and call train() it should train machine and prepare for applying to exactly these ones
 blackburn	when apply(CFeatures) is called it sets features for machines and applies
 n4nd0	ok, I understand
 n4nd0	the problem here is that somehow if we just do init_machines_for_applly before starting to train; it seg faults
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	sh
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	init_machines_for_apply should be called AFTER train
 n4nd0	aham I see
 n4nd0	just before the return?
 blackburn	yes probably
 blackburn	did you get this logic?
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	yeah, I think so
 n4nd0	I think that solution is better
 blackburn	3 cases
 blackburn	machine.set_features(train_features)
 blackburn	machine.train()
 blackburn	machine.apply()
 blackburn	next
 n4nd0	but still I don't know what may be wrond doing init_machines_for_train(NULL) in apply()
 blackburn	machine.train(features)
 blackburn	machine.apply()
 blackburn	in apply?
 blackburn	wait
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	damn this naming is pretty hard to understand
 n4nd0	at it's right now in MulticlassMachine.cpp:68
 blackburn	n4nd0: could you please rename it?
 blackburn	init_training_machine or so
 blackburn	init_apply_machines
 blackburn	may be tihs way?
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	machine and machines look confusing
 blackburn	lemme check the source
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok let me describe a wrong case
 blackburn	machine.apply(features)
 n4nd0	blackburn: that was one issue, there is another to look at
 n4nd0	blackburn: sorry, continue
 blackburn	when you call it
 blackburn	it sets features
 blackburn	and calls apply()
 blackburn	this time apply() sets features with NULL
 blackburn	and BADDABOOM
 n4nd0	I don't think so
 n4nd0	because init_machines_for_apply
 n4nd0	(init_apply_machines)
 n4nd0	doesn't set the features if they're NULL
 blackburn	really?
 n4nd0	if will skip the set features and reload the ones for m_machines
 n4nd0	the latter is what we are interested in
 blackburn	it was beyond my intention
 blackburn	oh really
 blackburn	I got wrong with my own logic
 n4nd0	idk, maybe init_machines_for_apply doesn't do the right thing in LinearMulticlassClassifier
 n4nd0	but it does so this far I think
 blackburn	damn I've got some doubts
 blackburn	anyway
 blackburn	use cases are
 blackburn	set features / set kernel
 blackburn	train()
 blackburn	apply()
 n4nd0	in any case I think that to do init_machines_for_apply at the end of train is better
 blackburn	set features / set kernel
 blackburn	train()
 blackburn	apply(features)
 blackburn	and
 blackburn	train(features)
 blackburn	apply(other_features)
 blackburn	no more cases I guess
 n4nd0	I will check if they're ok
 n4nd0	apart from that
 n4nd0	I also changed MulticlassMachine::train_machine
 n4nd0	the very beginning
 n4nd0	lines 87 - 90
 n4nd0	it's a similar idea, but the thing is that if it is not done this way, it seg faults in training
 blackburn	it should fail if it !is_ready()
 n4nd0	I am thinking now that maybe it is appropriate to do init_train_machines at the end of the constructor that takes features as argument
 blackburn	and there is no data
 blackburn	if there is no data*
 n4nd0	yeah I think that it's true, if features was not initialized in the constructor
 n4nd0	then the constructor with features must call init_machines_for_train
 n4nd0	do you see my point?
 blackburn	yes!
 blackburn	that was forgotten probably
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	machine_for_train
 blackburn	not machines :D
 blackburn	yeah embarrasing naming
 n4nd0	haha yeah I noted that
 blackburn	feel free to change it
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	it is in guts of these classes so ok to change
 blackburn	no API
 n4nd0	can we impose somehow that class that inherit from MulticlassMachine
 n4nd0	are compulsed to do these init_training_machine
 n4nd0	in the constructor that accepts Features?
 blackburn	it calls constructor of base class
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I think I need to implement that constructor then
 blackburn	so while init_training_machine is virtual
 blackburn	oh wait
 n4nd0	what happened?
 blackburn	hmm no way to do that probably
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	then it shouldn't be in the constructor
 n4nd0	wait I don't see it
 n4nd0	why no way?
 blackburn	well multiclass machine constructor can't get any features
 n4nd0	why not?
 blackburn	currently I mean
 n4nd0	even if features is not a member
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	why not to init_training_machine in train_machine?
 blackburn	in case of NULL data and is_ready()?
 blackburn	isn't it exactly what we need?
 n4nd0	yes ... I think so at least
 n4nd0	then we will call init_training_machine with NULL
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	I hope this all makes sense
 n4nd0	we'll see
 n4nd0	one thing about the doc, where should I put it? this might what S?ren told me yesterday but I might have not understood
 n4nd0	I mean for example, for LDA
 n4nd0	I would like to do sth similar for QDA
 n4nd0	as it appears in doxygen doc
 n4nd0	but I have not found that documentation in the code
 n4nd0	wait, I said nothing
 n4nd0	it is in the code ...
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah @brief part in .h
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am working in the code, in the train_machine part
 n4nd0	I really think that if ( !is_read() && !data ) then SG_ERROR
 n4nd0	in any other case init_training_machine
 n4nd0	init_training_machine(data) simply
 n4nd0	i.e. as it is in my branch right now
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	is it normal that LibLinear doesn't always give the same results?
 blackburn	n4nd0: multiclass?
 n4nd0	the example I am using for MulticlassMachine uses LinearMulticlassMachine with LibLinear
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	yes it is a little random
 blackburn	results shouldn't be *very* different though
 n4nd0	:O
 n4nd0	every once in a while
 blackburn	what kind of random you've got?
 n4nd0	I get a bunch of class 3 detected for what it is class 0
 blackburn	random labels?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	normally it classifies good
 n4nd0	but every 1 out 4 or 5 let's say, that happens
 blackburn	that's strange
 n4nd0	possible bug you think?
 blackburn	yes it should be almost equal..
 n4nd0	it happens just with ONE_VS_ONE actually :S
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	what?
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ah
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	what's going on?
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	I thought you mean MulticlassLibLinear
 blackburn	and was very afraid of it
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	no no
 n4nd0	so what do you think then?
 n4nd0	bad result?
 blackburn	n4nd0: well depends on data actually but strange anyway

 wiking	?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	ok so now it's starting to be ready
 wiking	just one more commit
 blackburn	wiking: what exactly? ;)
 wiking	latent svm
 wiking	api
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	lets see
 wiking	ok
 wiking	check this
 wiking	https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/commits/latent
 wiking	last two commits
 wiking	or rather
 wiking	https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/blob/6fef385b84ea003f398c32338337ae73ca06293f/src/shogun/classifier/svm/LatentLinearMachine.h
 blackburn	I'd suggest to move these things to shogun'/latent
 wiking	?
 blackburn	i think it is ok to move all latent domain specific things to shogun/latent
 blackburn	new dir
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	but why?
 wiking	anyhow here you go a new stupid pull request for shogun :))
 wiking	sent
 blackburn	wiking: I think domain specific separation is ok
 blackburn	I actually plan to move ready multitask things to shogun/multitask
 blackburn	and multiclass things to shogun/multiclass
 wiking	aha
 wiking	btw is this your email adds: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 wiking	?
 blackburn	wiking: yes both works
 blackburn	blackburn91 at gmail
 blackburn	and lisitsyn.s.o
 wiking	ok i'll send there now the email to you as well
 wiking	that goes for alex as well
 blackburn	ah ok sure
 wiking	ok email sent... apply my pull request :D
 blackburn	wiking: can't right now
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	hmm didn't received your mail
 blackburn	would be funny if it was considered as spam
 wiking	ahhahahahah
 wiking	maybe it is
 blackburn	ah it is ok

@sonney2k	except for missing rebase it looks very valid to me and should be merged...!

 flxb	I saved a classifier with pickle.dump() and then loaded it. When I do apply it throws "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'shogun::ShogunException'". Is there a way to get a more meaningful error or what could this be?
 blackburn	flxb: try to add init_shogun_with_defaults() once you import shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, he is using python already (pickle...)
@sonney2k	flxb, well you could do bla.io.set_loglevel(0)
 flxb	sonney2k: ok i don't know what effect init_shogun_with_defaults has. i'll try bla io log level 0
 flxb	sonney2k: ha, but what is bla? it's not in modshogun
 blackburn	flxb: any shogun object you use
@sonney2k	flxb, some shogun object :-)
 flxb	amusing, i'll give it a try
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hi! I have a doubt related to solving SVM optimization with the primal
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so can it be solved directly using a QP solver (let's say CPLEX or libqp)?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is there no need in using an specific SVM solver for that?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, svm's can be solved (in primal or dual) with off-the-shelve QP solvers
@sonney2k	but that's slow and memory demanding
@sonney2k	so tuned solutions are much faster / require less memory
 n4nd0	sonney2k: aha, I understand
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is there something already in shogun to solve the SVM in primal?
 blackburn	hey any crazy guy wanting to implement sparse matrix class?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, liblinear / libocas
@sonney2k	SGD
 n4nd0	blackburn: aren't CSparseFeatures for that?
@sonney2k	SGD-QN
 blackburn	n4nd0: I need pretty specific one
@sonney2k	probably more :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what's wrong with CSparseFeatures?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: oh all these can be used for primal? cool!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, primal (with no kernel!)
 blackburn	sonney2k: nothing but I need dymamic CSC matrix
 blackburn	dynamic
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I thought ocas is dual :(
 blackburn	my bad
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hmm I have to check if they could be used for the problem I am thinking of, for SO-SVM optimization
@sonney2k	blackburn, it uses cutting planes...
 blackburn	hmm true
 blackburn	I do not understand it thoroughly but I know it stands for s.t. part in primal ;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I suspect you would need sth like libqp but ask nico
 n4nd0	sonney2k: no way to do it with OCAS because of the kernel issue?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actually vojtech has an extension to ocas idea for SO
@sonney2k	that is the other SO task btw
@sonney2k	n4nd0, one is more the framework and some baseline algorithms, the other SO one would be one application of the framework but bleeding edge and potentially even better than svm struct
 n4nd0	sonney2k: mmm but this idea other talks about libqp and not OCAS
 gsomix	sonney2k, I had some problems with repo.
@sonney2k	gsomix, so can you open a new pull request?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, this idea http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html#bmrm
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
@sonney2k	hmmhh we have 5 student submissions by now - but none is from any of the active students here...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: oh sorry, I'm kind of retarded ... I was checking another one
 gsomix	sonney2k, but only tomorrow. I have some changes and I will complete it tomorrow.
 n4nd0	we have to get hands on to work with the application guys
 blackburn	oh not now
 n4nd0	I think I am going to start tonight with it :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: would you mind I attach a list of my commits?
 n4nd0	blackburn: :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, the post gsoc ones only please :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok, I've commited about 200 after gsoc :D
* gsomix was trying to do home work today. But he did little. (tag: whining.)
 n4nd0	blackburn: so should we attach the commits as well? I mean, isn't enough to give a brief description about what have we done?
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	that was joke!
 n4nd0	haha ok
 n4nd0	at first I took it like that
 n4nd0	but after the post gsoc comment
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you know if Nico has access to the applications? I'd like to ask him for feedback on the timeline for my application
 blackburn	well sonney2k is a great joker ;)
 n4nd0	I wonder if I should send it to him directly
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes - he is a mentor but it doesn't hurt to explicitly ask him
 n4nd0	thank you :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is it important to write some references (e.g. professors we have interactuated with)? or not really that much
@sonney2k	n4nd0, everything that separates you from other students helps!
 blackburn	e.g. if you've got three legs
 n4nd0	blackburn: :D
 blackburn	n4nd0: want to try dimensionality reduction?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	gsomix: want to try dimensionality reduction?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah! sure
 n4nd0	blackburn: what do you have in mind?
 blackburn	n4nd0: examples, I lack examples
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes, I like the idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: have you thought anything in particular?
 blackburn	ok simplest
 blackburn	download a few images somewhere
 blackburn	compute hue histograms
 blackburn	embed it with isomap/mds
 blackburn	will be a nice picture :)
 blackburn	check applications/edrt/faces.py to see how to place images on plot with matplotlib
 blackburn	oh actually I had a script somewhere
 blackburn	btw it is my gf ;)
 blackburn	(faces.py)
 n4nd0	blackburn: http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DD2427/bik12/DownloadMaterial/Lectures/Lecture1_part1.pdf
 n4nd0	check the previous to last page
 n4nd0	sth like that would be nice?
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	I'll give you some code in a min
 n4nd0	blackburn: so these slides are from one of the courses I told you the other day
 blackburn	aha I got it
 n4nd0	blackburn: we could prepare an example like this one we are talking about
 n4nd0	blackburn: and I can mail the professor and show her
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/pics.png
 n4nd0	blackburn: maybe that way we can start some shogun-university courses contact
 blackburn	why not :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: ^ that's how it worked
 n4nd0	blackburn: looks nice
 n4nd0	blackburn: you have the code for that right?
 blackburn	yeah let me find it
 gsomix	blackburn, dimensional reduction? no, I do not want to live in two-dimensional world.
 gsomix	if seriously, i will work on python3 and covertee.
 blackburn	remember I always have tasks
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok it is pretty crappy but here it goes
 blackburn	http://pastebin.com/QzBwcph5
 blackburn	there is even a hog function I borrowed somewhere
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rc375b8f / (5 files in 3 dirs): make director based classes optional - http://git.io/sXQslA
 blackburn	n4nd0: all you need is to get some pictures
 blackburn	ideally retrieve from google.. but it seems they do not provide such api
 n4nd0	mmm not good
 blackburn	n4nd0: any other options are welcome
 blackburn	haha I just realized all the pictures are upside down
 n4nd0	I will make a search about how to do get images, if it doesn't work, I'll pick some manually
 n4nd0	probably we don't need that many to make a nice-looking example
 n4nd0	any suggestion/preference of the class of pictures?
 blackburn	no, it is totally up to you
 blackburn	ah yes
 blackburn	install libsuperlu3
 blackburn	and libarpack
 blackburn	to make this feasible
 blackburn	in case of 3k-5k images it would be slow w/o superlu+arpack
 blackburn	however I can hardly imagine that
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: have you checked applications/edrt btw?
 blackburn	there are words embedding example as well
 n4nd0	I have not executed it
 n4nd0	which one is it?
 blackburn	words.py
 n4nd0	... I feel stupid sometimes I ask :O
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	words_embedding.py
 n4nd0	blackburn: libarpack2 is ok I guess
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	haha nice example
 blackburn	try faces_embedding.py as well
 n4nd0	fun one :)
 n4nd0	isn't she sad a couple of times but very separated on the plane :P?
 blackburn	too complex for any dim reduction algorithm
 blackburn	actually I should prepare data somehow
 n4nd0	I see
 blackburn	with centering at leat
 blackburn	least*
 blackburn	http://shogun-toolbox.org/edrt/
 blackburn	there are two more examples
 blackburn	with ORL and swissroll
 n4nd0	I like swissroll
 blackburn	yes it is easy but not real
 blackburn	local tangent space alignment is ideal with swissroll
 blackburn	but not as good with real data
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I want pictures of giraffes, zebras, horses etc :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I'll look for those then ;)
 n4nd0	oh, didn't understand anything in that last mail :S
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	heiko wrote in german oh lol
 blackburn	I shall answer him in russian
 n4nd0	can you read it?
 blackburn	no, how can I
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	haha don't know ... maybe you know German man
 blackburn	I wish I knew
 blackburn	ok sent
 blackburn	n4nd0: one more mail you won't understand ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: hahaha you are fun man
 n4nd0	blackburn: wanna do a guess what google translate tells me?
 blackburn	something reasonable I think
 n4nd0	quite reasonable actually
 n4nd0	Heiko,
 n4nd0	I generally do not understand what you wrote here! But to keep the conversation going write some thing about LibSVM too :)
 n4nd0	Sergey
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	right
 n4nd0	so the reverser R in Russian is I
 n4nd0	reversed*
 n4nd0	or flipped
 blackburn	n4nd0: ya
 blackburn	not i
 blackburn	like in young
 blackburn	ah you mean "I"
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I thought of sound
 n4nd0	ah ok
 blackburn	yes it is "I"
 n4nd0	I was like ... there is no i in young so I lost sth probably
 blackburn	hahh
@sonney2k	blackburn, heikos mail was a private mail to me ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: why did he CC shogun list then?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think he accidentally sent it to shogun list
@sonney2k	in the end it says 'migration business is complex'
 blackburn	sonney2k: well why not to joke ;)
@sonney2k	he managed to fix things but it took quite long
@sonney2k	and he is going to submit a patch ...
 blackburn	yes I did make use of google translate already
 gsomix	good night, guys
 n4nd0	gsomix: good night
@sonney2k	yeah good night
