@wiking	arghfuck
@wiking	anybody here?
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: here
 lisitsyn	sup
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	i hate to ask this
@wiking	but do you think it's ok that we'll require extra header flags to be able to compile external tools that depends on shogun
@wiking	?
@wiking	say you write something that uses shogun
@wiking	i would expect that the only shit you wanna be dependent on
@wiking	is
@wiking	-I<prefix>/include/shogun
@wiking	but since currently
@wiking	we have some class defintions
@wiking	that depends on third party libs
@wiking	like xml and json
 lisitsyn	oh
 lisitsyn	we need -I/xml
@wiking	it's not possible
@wiking	oooor
@wiking	we start opaque-ing?
@wiking	or just simply do
@wiking	extern...
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am all for opaquing stuff
 lisitsyn	externing is monkey job I am afraid
 lisitsyn	wiking: uhh that's a good thing
 lisitsyn	wiking: here at my job we are using static stuff heavily
 lisitsyn	maybe we can build stuff in that fashion
 lisitsyn	and put all the libs into
 lisitsyn	-Iinclude/shogun/libs
@wiking	ah you mean
@wiking	include all the headers?
@wiking	under our prefix?
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	cmake hackery
 lisitsyn	but simplifies life
 lisitsyn	for users
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	i mean now i already managed to get to a point
@wiking	where you can actually compile the modular interface
@wiking	to an installed libshogun
@wiking	cutting a lot of fucking shitty cmake stuff
@wiking	there was a point
@wiking	where i said
@wiking	bazer
@wiking	:D
@wiking	but no... not gonna rewrite this one
@wiking	i was meaning to write bazel
@wiking	https://bazel.build/
@wiking	the cmake i wrote in this shit almost cost my phd :)
 lisitsyn	bazel
 lisitsyn	hmm
 lisitsyn	it may be pretty good idea
@wiking	tf uses that
@wiking	if i could finish this shit
 lisitsyn	well google uses
 lisitsyn	so tf does
@wiking	we are golden with all the debian packages
@wiking	:)
@wiking	i mean now only libshogun is available in our ppa
@wiking	if this is done we can haz again shogun-python,ruby...
 lisitsyn	wiking: ok so ew can consider static stuff with bazel?
@wiking	lol
@wiking	i'm not gonna be part of a recreate
@wiking	of build
@wiking	we can do it when we slice up this shit
@wiking	to add bazel
@wiking	until then i dont wanna touch this more than necessary
@wiking	but man
@wiking	can u believe that swig is so inactive
@wiking	that nobody answers my email on the mailing list...
