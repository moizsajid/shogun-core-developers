 wiking	blackburn: https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/builds/2851675
 wiking	so basically it's working now... apart from having troubles in the examples.. but that's not the setup's fault :P
 wiking	i guess sonney2k is away atm :)
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	blackburn i'll fix now still clang compilation problems and i'll send in a PR about this travis thing, see if u/soeren likes it
 wiking	btw
 wiking	i wonder why does regression_gaussian_process_ard fail there
 wiking	and not on my machine :)
 wiking	and same goes with base_map_parameters
 wiking	that fails on my machine but not on travis
 wiking	as well as converter_localitypreservingprojections
 blackburn	it requires nlopt ?? ??
 blackburn	oops
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	it needs an IFDEF then somewhere
 wiking	:))
 blackburn	about LPP
 blackburn	no idea
 wiking	blackburn: [ERROR] Failed to solve eigenproblem (6)
 wiking	this is what i get vrom LPP
 blackburn	wiking: bad data is used..
 blackburn	it should not appear on the daily basis actually :D
 wiking	my data repo is up-to-date
 wiking	so i dont knwo how can it get bad data
 wiking	nevermind
 wiking	here's a fix for the regression shit
 blackburn	wiking: no, normally it is bad data
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	that fm_train_real is a little bad for dim reduction
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n175-p42.kthopen.kth.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	a few linear dependent vectors in there
 n4nd0	wiking: hey
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey n4nd0 it's been a while :)
 wiking	n4nd0: hey ! just a sec
 wiking	be right back
 blackburn	did your exam take place?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 blackburn	how was it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I finished it barely half an hour ago
 n4nd0	psee... just fine
 wiking	blackburn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/796
 wiking	btw lol check out the PR's description bottom :D
 wiking	it'll actually show now whether this really fixed it :DDD
 wiking	cool
 wiking	n4nd0: so here?
 n4nd0	wiking: yes
 wiking	lolface wtf is this https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/builds/2852006
 wiking	aaah ok
 wiking	i know
 wiking	n4nd0: so the thing is that i'm trying to use your mosek solver
 wiking	but it's giving me bad results
 wiking	thus i think the formulation is wrong
 wiking	but then yesterday you've sent me the formula
 wiking	and that's what i want to solve
 wiking	soooo
 wiking	actually i have a code for you
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	so what does that but mean?
 n4nd0	do you still think the formulation is wrong or not? :)
 wiking	nono
 wiking	it's good
 wiking	it's what i want
 wiking	blackburn: can u plz merge it?
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	n4nd0: so here's the thing http://pastebin.com/hPSimMdA
 wiking	n4nd0: this way of using mosek
 wiking	for the same problem
 wiking	i get much better results
 wiking	you were using mosek more
 wiking	so you might be able to tell me
 wiking	where i'm going wrong :)
 n4nd0	mmm but if you get better results
 blackburn	wiking: merged
 wiking	blackburn: thnx
 n4nd0	shouldn't that be that your way is better?
 n4nd0	hehe
 wiking	n4nd0: i dont have a fuking clue
 n4nd0	mmm ok
 n4nd0	so what have you seen different from my implementation and that file you've sent me?
 n4nd0	and I am no expert in mosek :P
 wiking	well the Q0
 wiking	how it looks like
 wiking	it's tootaly different
 wiking	with your implementation
 wiking	Q0 = I
 wiking	for me
 n4nd0	mmm but Q0 = I is not something general
 n4nd0	I might have used it for one of the models
 wiking	yes
 n4nd0	but you should be able to use any other Q if you wish
 wiking	but i need to solve this
 wiking	i know
 n4nd0	for example the HM-SVM uses another one
 wiking	but the thing is
 wiking	that C = Q0
 wiking	more or less
 n4nd0	well yes ... more or less
 n4nd0	part of it
 wiking	so because
 wiking	my equation and constraint looks like this
 wiking	http://www.centrale-ponts.fr/personnel/pawan/publications/MKPGK-AISTATS2012.pdf
 wiking	page 3
 wiking	Algo. 1
 wiking	sorry page 4
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	C = 1 in my case
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	i mean in Algo 1 C = 1
 n4nd0	yes, I understand
 wiking	and thus i though C matrix to be I
 n4nd0	what about 1/n?
 wiking	i scale PSI() vectors with that
 wiking	so dont worry
 wiking	that's solved
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	then it should be identity matrix for Q
 n4nd0	well sorry
 n4nd0	the part 1/2 w' * C * w of the formulation I use
 n4nd0	should be n/C in algorithm 1 IIRC
 wiking	?
 n4nd0	since you say that C = 1 and you are accounting for n somewhere else then it should be ok with the identity
 wiking	yeah that's what i thought
 n4nd0	I am not sure if you can actually account for n in the PSI() but I trust you have done that right :)
 wiking	but then using that code with different Q
 wiking	i get much better result
 wiking	but everything else is the same
 n4nd0	what is the different Q?
 n4nd0	maybe you are actually encoding another value for C there
 wiking	it's a Gramm matrix
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	why don't you just show the matrices and vectors given to mosek in both cases?
 n4nd0	if they are the same, then you must get the same result
 shogun-buildbot	build #453 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test libshogun]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/453  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	if they are different, well then it may be normal that you get other results
 wiking	how can i debug that part?
 wiking	i mean within mosek
 n4nd0	you shouldn't need to debug in mosek
 wiking	is there a func for that?
 n4nd0	use it as a black box
 n4nd0	I already put some methods to print the matrices and vectors given to mosek
 n4nd0	let me check the name
 n4nd0	I think it was display_problem
 wiking	but that code i've given u
 wiking	on pastebin
 wiking	it's not part of shogun
 wiking	but none the less
 wiking	i'll print it
 n4nd0	well.. use the same I used in the method I am telling you
 wiking	but i just wonder
 wiking	whether that mosek_qp_opt
 wiking	code uses some differnt parts of mosek?
 wiking	i mean different solver?
 n4nd0	it could be
 n4nd0	but that shouldn't give you a different answer
 n4nd0	since the problem I solved is convex
 n4nd0	so let's do this
 n4nd0	display the problem
 n4nd0	https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/mathematics/Mosek.cpp
 n4nd0	see CMosek::display_problem ^
 wiking	ok lemme check
 n4nd0	do that in shogun and in your code
 n4nd0	and compare
 wiking	ok
 wiking	cool
 n4nd0	let me know ;)
 wiking	woooohooo
 wiking	https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/builds/2852182
 wiking	works finally
 n4nd0	what's that?
 wiking	n4nd0: it's like buildbot
 wiking	n4nd0: but it's nicely integrated with github
 n4nd0	cool
 wiking	n4nd0: so for example when somebody sends a PR
 wiking	to the project
 wiking	automatically tries to compile the code with that patch
 wiking	and will tell on the PR page
 wiking	whether that PR breaks the code or not
 n4nd0	cool, it looks like something useful
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	wanna convince blackburn and sonney2k to use it
 wiking	but there's still some shit with clang
 wiking	so i have to fix that before sending in the PR about this
 wiking	but i'll just go and get now some food/coffee
 wiking	and try this mosek thingy
 wiking	as it's more interesting now for me

 wiking	n4nd0: still here?
 n4nd0	wiking: yep
 wiking	||w||^2 = dot product right?
 wiking	i mean this is completely unrelated
 n4nd0	what is unrelated?
 wiking	this question
 wiking	from mosek
 wiking	:D
 wiking	l2-norm = dot prddcoduct
 wiking	product
 n4nd0	and yes ||w||^2 w'*w that is the dot product
 n4nd0	I meant that the l2-norm squared is also w'*w
 wiking	ok here it goes
 wiking	printing out the problem :)
 wiking	first compiling
 n4nd0	looking forward :)
 wiking	n4nd0: should i display it after each iteration?
 n4nd0	wiking: the idea is to compare why you don't get the same results
 n4nd0	so do it every time the optimization problem is to be solved
 wiking	heh
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	then i have to dump it into a log file :)
 n4nd0	hehe yeah
 n4nd0	I did that for testing even for small problem instances
 wiking	-rw-r--r-- 1 wiking staff 101M Oct 19 15:38 primal.mosek.log
 wiking	:>
 wiking	still growing
 n4nd0	wtf ...
 n4nd0	can't you make a smaller instance of the problem?
 n4nd0	if they are different it should actually be possible to see it in a toy example
 wiking	ok
 wiking	it's pretty different
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	you mean the Q, A etc matrices?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	while in your case as we defined
 wiking	Q = I
 n4nd0	then it's no wonder that the results were different ;)
 wiking	Q = I*2191523.16
 wiking	and the A vector is like
 wiking	0,: = 1
 n4nd0	maybe they are multiplying Q by n or a factor of some sense
 n4nd0	to solve min ||w||^2 + C/n sum_i \xi_i
 n4nd0	is equivalent to solve
 wiking	here's en example
 wiking	in your case
 wiking	Variable Bounds, vectors lb and ub:
 wiking	-1000000000000000019884624838656.00 1000000000000000019884624838656.00
 wiking	Variable Bounds, vectors lb and ub: 0.00 1000000000000000019884624838656.00
 wiking	so there's a similarity at least :DD
 n4nd0	hehe
 n4nd0	read that as -inf
 n4nd0	the first one is not bounded
 n4nd0	while the second one is forced to be positive
 n4nd0	the second type is normally used for \xi_i
 n4nd0	the first one for the elements in w
 wiking	and the A is like this
 wiking	atrix A:
 wiking	(0,0)   1.00
 wiking	(0,1)   1.00
 wiking	whie in your case
 wiking	Matrix A:
 wiking	(0,0)   2.00
 wiking	(0,1)   0.10
 wiking	(0,2)   -0.07
 wiking	pretty random numbers :)
 wiking	in this other solver Matrix A is not even a matrix
 wiking	it's just a vector
 wiking	with about 56 elements that are exactly equal to 1.0
 wiking	or that varies
 wiking	so the number of element in matrix a grows after each iteration
 n4nd0	they are not random numbers
 wiking	and they are equal to 1.0
 wiking	but in your case
 n4nd0	take a look to the formulation to understand their meaning
 wiking	Matrix A is a full-blown n*n matrix where n = dim(n)
 wiking	n=dim(w)
 wiking	and they are not 1.0
 wiking	so i guess the formulation is just different :D
 n4nd0	but if you want to solve the same problem
 n4nd0	then the formulation cannot be different
 wiking	hehehe
 n4nd0	I am coming back later
 wiking	okey
 wiking	i should put this solver into shogun :)))
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	SVMLight.cpp
 wiking	how's this related to svm^light?
 wiking	:>
 wiking	blackburn: here?
 n4nd0	wiking: what solver?
 n4nd0	the pastebin snippet?
 wiking	n4nd0: no the whole thing around it
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I think that actually you should do an StructuredModel
 wiking	this is a latent struct svm solver
 wiking	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cnyu/latentssvm/latentssvm_v0.11.mosek.tar.gz
 wiking	based on mosek
 wiking	yeah i thought about the same that maaaybe with a very custom init_ops function
 wiking	i could mimic it
 n4nd0	we have that method already
 n4nd0	init_opt
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	that's what i mean
 wiking	because now it's very simple
 wiking	Q = I
 wiking	and that's i
 wiking	it
 wiking	but the problem is
 wiking	that for example in this solver
 n4nd0	so why don't you just re-implement the model and do what you need?
 wiking	because as i was about to say
 wiking	in this solver
 wiking	after each iteration
 wiking	Q changes
 wiking	hence init_opt is not really a thign for me
 wiking	as that only init-ed in the beginning
 n4nd0	aham so Q changes
 wiking	before the optimization cycle
 wiking	cycles for that matter...
 wiking	yeah
 n4nd0	I don't think I took that into account
 wiking	and A as well
 n4nd0	that is taken into account
 n4nd0	to put more constraints
 wiking	within iterations?
 wiking	ah ok yeah
 wiking	yeah yeah i see that now
 wiking	in primalmoseksosvm
 wiking	and now i was just wondering how is svm^light included in shogun (really cannot figure it out with the original package)
 wiking	as there's a version based on svm^light as well
 wiking	as well as
 wiking	mosek
 wiking	and the other question here is of course
 wiking	can this be used for simple structural learning
 wiking	but afaik yeas
 wiking	because the inner loop of a latent sosvm = a simple sosvm
 wiking	so for that matter it would be good to port the svm^light based sosvm into shogun as well
 n4nd0	sounds reasonable
 wiking	and there basically it's just a simple switch between svm^light and mosek solver
 wiking	basically it's a oneliner :)
 wiking	anyhow i have no fucking clue how is svm^light integrated into shogun
 wiking	as checking SVMLight.h/cpp
 wiking	it seems pretty different from the original one :)
 wiking	blackburn: where are u? :D
 wiking	i mean the funny thing here all in all
 wiking	that when i use your solver
 wiking	primalmoseksosvm
 wiking	i get very good PO
 wiking	meaning it's better than the one i find with P3BMRM
 wiking	but the performance on the test set is significantly worse
 wiking	than P3BMRM
 blackburn	wiking: here
 blackburn	what's up?
 wiking	sssblacksvmlight
 wiking	information i need
 wiking	do you know anything about it?
 wiking	i mean how is it ported into shogun?
 blackburn	wtf is with your message :D
 wiking	hehehe i dont know :)))
 wiking	i think mosh fscked it up
 blackburn	well it is not a base svmlight
 blackburn	see header

 blackburn	uh it is 1999 when sonney2k was young :D
 blackburn	and I was 8
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	hahahah 8 :)
 blackburn	wiking: I can be sure I didn't patch it because when I was 8 I preferred to ride a bike or to read some books about rome or to play some games
 wiking	dman it :)
 blackburn	hmm one can not simply close skype in ubuntu
 wiking	i hoped you wee already hacking some svms :P
 wiking	at tat age i mean :)
 wiking	man i have one char per minute on this stupid mobile net on the train
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	where are you moving to?
 blackburn	finally decided to visit bryansk?
 wiking	nowhere
 wiking	going home
 blackburn	ah I can't get used you use trains to get home :D
 blackburn	you and sonney2k at least
 wiking	i was visiting a uni today for some collaborations
 blackburn	I usually use trams and buses :D
 wiking	yeah stupid westerneuropean thing.... they haven't heard of internetz "DDD
 wiking	yah i'm taking a train for 50kms :)
 blackburn	do you live 50 km far away from that uni?
 blackburn	use bike!
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	soon my cell coverage is going to die :))
 blackburn	so you joked and you are going to bryansk
 blackburn	I can hardly believe there is no coverage
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	usually around half way to home there's a blind spot for about 20kms :D
 wiking	2the ;ast two sentence took about 2.5 mins to be sent :)))
 blackburn	huh and last one was corrupted
 wiking	hehehe yeah :)))
 wiking	crc :P
 wiking	crc error
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn	we've got 3g internet all the 100km way from toliatti to samara
 blackburn	you third world country
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	hehehehe seems so :D
 wiking	and it's even expensive
 wiking	they ask freaking 10 euros for 500megs
 wiking	can u believe that ? :D
 blackburn	even here it is cheapier :D
 wiking	yeah i think  everywher lese is cheaper
 blackburn	are you sure it is belgium not nigeria or somalia?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	*else
 wiking	dude i'm really not so shure
 blackburn	I should be banned from visiting belgium after all these jokes :D
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@n175-p42.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 blackburn	and the last one before ban :D "EU doesn't deserve the Nobel prize! You participate in wars!"
 wiking	yeyeah i'm looking forward to the day whe i can lift of from here :)
 blackburn	to belarus?
 blackburn	may be kyrgyzstan? it is like borat's country from the borat movie but worse :D

 wiking	CopyCatSOSVM
 wiking	:)
 wiking	since this is going to be the copy-cat of the so-svm of joachim's implementation
 blackburn	it fails on that line?
 blackburn	that's kinds strange
 blackburn	didn't you forget about namespace or anything?
 wiking	yeah maybe
 wiking	no
 wiking	i don't
 blackburn	show me the code then :D
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/GkwpXxyT
 wiking	this is the definition
 wiking	very very basic :))))
 wiking	as i've just started to implemt it
 wiking	i used have this problem before
 wiking	but i cannot recall how i solved this
 blackburn	can't see nothing wrong out there
 wiking	ohcomeonwtf :D
 blackburn	what?
 wiking	i dont know why isnt' it working: D
 wiking	i already did a make clean && make
 wiking	nada
 wiking	HELP!
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	not yet?
 wiking	nothing
 wiking	it's the same
 wiking	let's try another make clean && make
 wiking	combo
 blackburn	in hope it could be a combo breaker, yeah
 wiking	so travis go/no-go?
 wiking	btw heiko has some funky commits
 wiking	'n instantiation of member function 'shogun::SGMatrix<unsigned long long>::operator==' requested here'
 wiking	control may reach end of non-void function
 blackburn	wiking: I am ok with travis
 wiking	i meant that
 wiking	should i PR the .travis.yaml?
 blackburn	feel free :)
 wiking	do you have admin right for the shogun repo?
 blackburn	I am not sure
 wiking	since the thing is
 wiking	that imho
 blackburn	probably not
 wiking	that main repo should be linked with travis
 blackburn	I mean I could push but not sure I can set up things
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	can u try this
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 wiking	do you have there an Admin tab?
 wiking	and i have still the same rror

 blackburn	I do not
 blackburn	wiking: is your .h included in classlist?
 wiking	ok then you don't have admin access
 wiking	so then only sonney2k can fix this
 blackburn	yeah then we would have to wait
 wiking	classlist?
 wiking	shogun/base/class_list.cpp
 wiking	?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	damnfuck
 wiking	it's not
 wiking	where how? :)
 wiking	hah lol
 wiking	i renamed it to CCCSOSVM
 wiking	and now it works
 wiking	WHYYYY
 wiking	nevermind i give a fuck
 wiking	it compiles
 blackburn	he
 blackburn	we assume C*
 wiking	still it was CCSOSVM
 wiking	:)
 wiking	so there was enough C in the beginning :D
 blackburn	but header was CCSOSVM too?
 wiking	you mean the header file?
 wiking	yeah it was called CCSOSVM.h
 wiking	so i guess then it was looking for CSOSVM.h
 wiking	or something like that
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	exactly
 wiking	ok let's shogunize 2 functions :)
 wiking	s/double/float64_t/g
 wiking	:D
 wiking	what's long
 wiking	int64_t?
 blackburn	I have no idea actually
 blackburn	long int long
 blackburn	long long int
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	what is long :)
 blackburn	long is kind of
 blackburn	it is like a hint
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I don't like 64/32 thing actually
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	I am ok to have only 'double'
 blackburn	or 'float'
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	where the fuck are the types defined ? :)
 wiking	hahah
 wiking	converter/Isomap.cpp:   inline double distance(const ISOMAP_COVERTREE_POINT& p) const
 wiking	still some doubles left in the repo
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	#define double float64_t okay

 wiking	wtf is DOC
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	DOC is DOC
 wiking	heehhe
 wiking	i guess :>
 blackburn	why that inplace new fucks up!
 blackburn	:(
 blackburn	Y U CANT SIMPLY allocate
 wiking	:)
 wiking	BUUUUURN
 wiking	lets FORK shogun :)))
 wiking	and add STL and openmp
 wiking	and all the funkiest shit eeeveeer!
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn	boost
 wiking	and boost
 wiking	!!!
 wiking	yes
 wiking	i was just about to write it
 blackburn	a lot of boost
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	boost the motherfucker up!
 blackburn	well actually there could be funny things
 blackburn	with boost parsers we could parse kernels
 wiking	nyamm
 wiking	btw: what was the 'standard' parallel execution in shogun
 blackburn	so one writes say ParsedKernel('exp(||x-y||^2)')
 wiking	using simply posix pthread calls?
 blackburn	pthreads
 wiking	yooohoooo
 wiking	funkyshiiiit!
 wiking	http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTIwNjE
 wiking	6 days old news
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: shogun gave us a lot of lessons learnt
 blackburn	at least design-wise
 blackburn	I'd say implementing such library with all these lessons *learnt* could take much less time
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	what's in a library
 wiking	just take it
 wiking	:)
 wiking	and dont include it
 wiking	:))
 wiking	libsvm
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	suppose that we have libsvm
 wiking	liblinear
 wiking	same
 blackburn	I thought about linking to it
 wiking	#include <liblinear....MOTHERFUCKA"
 wiking	if u don't have it
 blackburn	but no, it doesn't work
 wiking	fuck UUU
 wiking	if u dont have boost
 wiking	fuck uuu
 blackburn	haha
 wiking	if you dont have STL
 wiking	then well
 blackburn	hahah no stl?
 wiking	u dont have anythign to start with
 blackburn	is that gcc 1.0?
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	go for lua lesson
 wiking	:)
 wiking	and FUCK U
 wiking	of course
 wiking	:)
 wiking	no openmp
 blackburn	wiking: actually about solvers I am really saddened we can't just include it
 wiking	FUCK UUU
 wiking	in fact
 wiking	one would have to work really really hard
 blackburn	because developers of such libraries are idiot savants
 wiking	not to get fucked
 wiking	:D
 wiking	buut
 wiking	that would be an awesome lightweight library :)
 wiking	yeah i know
 wiking	i mean fuck man
 wiking	when u can segfault svmlight
 wiking	with simply not giving enough arguments
 wiking	then i say
 wiking	FUCK U
 blackburn	liblinear is unusable without our patches
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	we sshould have FUCK_YOU  macro
 wiking	hehehe
 blackburn	#define REQUIRE(x) if (!x) FUCK_YOU;
 wiking	:>>>
 blackburn	most intolerant library ever
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	it's good enough though
 wiking	to rely already on some basic stuff
 wiking	like lapack
 wiking	and eigen
 wiking	but yeah
 blackburn	no lapack
 wiking	for that matter
 blackburn	no more lapack
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	just eigen
 wiking	and no SGVector
 wiking	there's eigen
 wiking	it's goodenough
 wiking	:)
 wiking	has everything
 wiking	matrices
 wiking	vectors
 wiking	whaaateeeveeeeer
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	no more lapack in 21st century
 wiking	no eigne
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	FUCK UUUUU
 blackburn	eigen can be installed even on ARM
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	it has some nice neon optimized code
 wiking	so it's really cool
 wiking	mm
 wiking	that would be an interesting thing
 wiking	to try to replace SGMatrix with eigen's matrix
 wiking	wonder how much time would it need :)
 blackburn	sounds pretty tricky
 wiking	but i guess the most pain would be
 wiking	the interfaces part
 wiking	:)
 wiking	but as a first step
 wiking	let's have c++11 STL and boost
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	fork shogun -> fucku
 blackburn	fuckun
 wiking	fucku branch
 wiking	:)
 wiking	where's gsomix?
 blackburn	somewhere in my room
 wiking	maaaan it's amazing how everybody disappeared after the money has gone (~ gsoc)
 blackburn	hah did you ever think it won't happen?
 wiking	no not really
 wiking	i remember when i've joined the channel last february
 blackburn	it was me and soeren
 wiking	that there was like the 2 of you and the bots
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	and some accidental guests
 wiking	and then suddenly
 wiking	around march/april is it?
 blackburn	yeah
 wiking	when the gsoc people started like flooding
 wiking	we had like contantly 11 people around
 wiking	i bet it's going to be the same in 2013
 blackburn	sure
 wiking	but no more gsoc for me
 wiking	although i'd like to mentor
 blackburn	I will be eligible twice more but not sure it is a good idea
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	why not
 wiking	i mean if u can do it?
 wiking	meaning you have time
 wiking	then do it
 blackburn	it probably makes more sense to find a similar money job now (what I am trying to do)
 blackburn	and mentor
 wiking	:>>
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	one of next year gsoc project should be
 wiking	boost+stl
 wiking	:DDD
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	i mean shogun+boost+stl
 wiking	:>
 wiking	that'd be totally worth it
 blackburn	big project
 wiking	ok
 wiking	back to copy-cat solver
 wiking	:>>>
 wiking	let's see how i can hackdizshit together before i fall asleep
 blackburn	just for experiment I want to develop templated CS liblinear solver
 wiking	hahahaha
 blackburn	with eigen
 wiking	the reason i've asked about openmp
 wiking	because p3bmrm is totally paralizable
 wiking	or how the fuck u spell that shiat
 blackburn	parallelizable yeah idiot word
 wiking	parallelizible :)
 blackburn	???????????????
 blackburn	even more idiot in russian
 wiking	you can fuckin even
 wiking	distribute that
 wiking	so basically that svm
 wiking	is totallly map-reduceable
 wiking	:)
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	this is a call for a mahout patch
 wiking	:))))
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	seriously
 blackburn	they seem to be not mature enough to use such complex methods :D
 wiking	ahhaha lolface
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	may be you rather choose k-means
 wiking	yeah i mean i love opensource projects
 blackburn	or nearest centroid :D
 wiking	where u send in a bug report + patch for fixing it
 wiking	and then it takes about 4-5 months
 wiking	to apply it
 blackburn	yeah it is cool
 wiking	BUT
 wiking	not your patch
 wiking	but the header rewritten patch
 wiking	i.e. that they dont' even fucking give credit nowhere in the commit log
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	that's like totally fucking great :)
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	ok recoding
 wiking	i feel like a fucking parser/translator
 wiking	this thing could be totally done by a fucking LL(k) parser
 wiking	blackburn: sgvector::resize does the whole reallocation thingy?
 blackburn	no idea
 blackburn	realloc probably
 wiking	let'show
 wiking	hop
 wiking	e
 wiking	:>
 wiking	is there a good vim plugin
 wiking	that can jump to the implementation and definition of a function?
 blackburn	yes it is already in
 blackburn	it works using ctags
 blackburn	http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/C%2B%2B_code_completion for example
 blackburn	or that
