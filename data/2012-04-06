 pluskid	n4nd0: I'm officially graduated now
 pluskid	finished all the busy stuff
 n4nd0	pluskid: oh that's really cool, congrats :)
 pluskid	Thanks!
 n4nd0	is your major in computer science or already sth more particular?
 pluskid	Now I started to read some related papers
 pluskid	CS :)
 pluskid	how about you?
 n4nd0	I am fine
 n4nd0	having my personal battle with cover trees for KNN :P
 pluskid	what is a cover tree?
 n4nd0	is a tree structure that can be used for fast nearest neighbors
 pluskid	KDTree?
 n4nd0	not sure if they're the same
 pluskid	OK, I see
 n4nd0	I don't think so
 n4nd0	it seems that KDTrees are binary trees right?
 pluskid	yes, IIRC
 n4nd0	cover trees are not
 n4nd0	the results people have got with them for KNN are nice
 pluskid	Then how it works? Do a hierarchical clustering and use that clustering tree to search?
 n4nd0	check it out if interested
 n4nd0	http://hunch.net/~beygel/cover-tree.pdf
 pluskid	Ah, hunch.net is a famous site :D
 n4nd0	if you mean with hierarchical that the nodes in the tree are stored depending on their distances between each other, yes
 pluskid	So you are implementing this in shogun?
 n4nd0	the cover tree is already there
 n4nd0	is ported from an open source implementation
 n4nd0	I am integrating it with KNN
 pluskid	OK, I see, you are using this to speed up KNN
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	I have it integrated already, just polishing details
 pluskid	Cool!
 n4nd0	but it would be nice to have examples for speedup like the ones in the paper
 pluskid	Yes, some benchmark test on some standard dataset
 pluskid	Cover tree looks cool. the limitation of KDTree is that it becomes slow when the dimension is high
 n4nd0	I see, are they use for speedup as well?
 pluskid	yes
 pluskid	For speed up NN Search
 pluskid	or do approximate NN search
 pluskid	(not sure whether cover tree can do approximate NN search)
 n4nd0	I have seen cool figures related to kd trees, but didn't really know about them http://www.google.se/imgres?um=1&hl=sv&biw=1366&bih=654&tbm=isch&tbnid=oAvpRgWrcLE9VM:&imgrefurl=http://docs.pointclouds.org/trunk/group__kdtree.html&docid=vLhvyDzQfouQKM&imgurl=http://www.pointclouds.org/assets/images/contents/documentation/kdtree_mug.png&w=525&h=465&ei=v4Z-T8H3I8eM4gTutODsBw&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=182&vpy=172&dur=1633&hovh=211&hovw=239&tx=88&ty
 pluskid	basically, it split the searching for neighbors along each dimension
 pluskid	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree
 pluskid	The 2D example is good for understanding
 pluskid	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Kdtree_2d.svg/300px-Kdtree_2d.svg.png
 pluskid	But when the data dimension grows, the depth of the tree grows, and searching becomes slow
 n4nd0	oh wait, yeah I did hear about this kd-trees in a course :P
 pluskid	:)
 pluskid	I think kd tree is widely used in practice
 pluskid	another related interesting (more theory or algorithm oriented) work is random projection tree
 pluskid	by Sanjoy Dusgupta: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/papers/rptree-stoc.pdf
 pluskid	IIRC, it has the advantage over KDTree that
 pluskid	when the *intrinsic dimension* of the data is low, its performance do not degenerate even when the extrinsic data dimension is very high (like KDTree)
 n4nd0	aham, interesting
 pluskid	but I do not know whether it is already used in some real-world projects already
 pluskid	n4nd0: have you worked on structured learning before?
 n4nd0	pluskid: no, just the stuff I have been reading when I got to know the project in shogun
 pluskid	me too
 n4nd0	it looks really nice though
 pluskid	yes, got applied in lots of practical problems
 n4nd0	you are mainly interested in computer vision, aren't you?
 pluskid	actually, I heard someone else in my lab is using structured SVM to do human detection
 pluskid	actually, I'm mainly in machine learning :D
 n4nd0	ok
 pluskid	how about you, what's your interest?
 n4nd0	robotics
 pluskid	that's cool!
 n4nd0	my master is on that
 pluskid	what kind of robots do you work with?
 n4nd0	we don't get that much in contact with real robots to tell the truth :S
 n4nd0	but my focus is on autonomous systems
 pluskid	so, the software part?
 n4nd0	I am interested in localization, mapping, navigation
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	I am a CS guy :)
 pluskid	Aha! :D
 pluskid	I have some very limited knowledge of reinforcement learning
 pluskid	do you use RL in your work?
 n4nd0	I would like to learn more about it
 n4nd0	SO is applied in RL according to what I have heard
 pluskid	oh?
 pluskid	for example?
 n4nd0	for navigation
 n4nd0	like in order to optimize the best sequence of actions
 n4nd0	but I have not found more stuff beyond mentions like that one
 pluskid	ok, I see
 n4nd0	pluskid: thinking of doing a new patch for shogun or already working on sth?
 pluskid	reading papers
 n4nd0	ok
 pluskid	you have done a lot of improvements to shogun these days! :D
 n4nd0	not that many
 pluskid	I'm trying to figure out some basic stuffs related to SO implementations
 pluskid	and what is already there in shogun
 n4nd0	I see

 karlnapf	sonney2k, blackburn, around?
 blackburn	karlnapf: yeap
 karlnapf	Just working on subsets and thinking of the case when the subset is larger than the number of features
 karlnapf	should we allow this?
 karlnapf	then people could kind of "duplicate" features
 karlnapf	but I dont know if that might kill something else
 blackburn	something like
 blackburn	1 2 1?
 karlnapf	yes
 blackburn	do you think it makes sense?
 karlnapf	if you want to have duplicate features for some reason
 karlnapf	mmh
 karlnapf	no it makes no sense i guess
 karlnapf	:D
 blackburn	if there was at least one use case of that..
 blackburn	for training NNs probably
 karlnapf	MMh I think I will put an error message and if people complain I will allow it
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	they didn't yet, right?

 pluskid	repetition sometimes can be used as poor man's way of doing re-weighting of samples
 pluskid	but not all algorithm can work with duplicated data
 pluskid	for re-weighting, I mean, for example, you have 1000 positive samples but only 10 negative samples
 blackburn	yeah but it is rather poor
 pluskid	sure
@sonney2k	karlnapf, don't try to solve a problem we don't have yet :D
@sonney2k	pluskid, yeah I used that too :D
 pluskid	haha
 karlnapf	sonney2k, yeah, sounds like a good idea :)
 karlnapf	pluskid, I also did that at some -late night bugfixing and not knowing wheres the error-point
 karlnapf	 :)
 pluskid	you mean duplication of data was causing errors? :p
 karlnapf	no I was searching why my methos did not work and duplicated data to check if the results were consistent
 pluskid	Ah, I see
 karlnapf	so it finally helped my finding the error ;)
 pluskid	cool
 karlnapf	but this is all not how it should be I guess
 pluskid	maybe only work for some particular case/algor

@sonney2k	38
 blackburn	huh
 PhilTillet	hi sonney2k :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I get about 8 emails about updated/new proposals per hour now...
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I guess it will be 16 this evening
 blackburn	I have to update my proposal as well
 blackburn	sonney2k: things stay the same, right? you said last year there were a lot of proposal before deadline

-!- n4nd0 [~nando@h121n3-ksg-a11.ias.bredband.telia.com] has joined #shogun
 emrecelikten	38 proposals... So, the probability of being accepted for a candidate is roughly 0.1316 then
 emrecelikten	assuming 5 slots
 emrecelikten	and equal chance for everybody
 n4nd0	38 proposals! that's a good number I guess
 wiking	n4nd0: you were looking for me
 n4nd0	wiking: I needed git support a moment
 wiking	n4nd0: sure shoot
 n4nd0	wiking: I did a pull request without rebasing master, later I rebase in my master and in my branch but when I wanted to push I got the error of non-fast forward allowed
 n4nd0	wiking: they suggested me to pull
 n4nd0	wiking: I asked blackburn and he told me that pulling was the best option probably

 wiking	n4nd0: yep you'll need to do a pull first in order to do the sync with your remote repo on github
 n4nd0	wiking: idk if that would make a problem related to the pull request though, like sending commits done by other people
 wiking	well
 wiking	it won't include the other commits
@sonney2k	last year we had more than 70 though
 wiking	of other people.... just yours and the merging
 n4nd0	wiking: I am going to try now, let's see
 pluskid	n4nd0: delete your remote branch and push again
 n4nd0	pluskid: no need to do that :)
 emrecelikten	I'm looking for ideas to make a patch about. Suggestions are welcome :)
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: yes
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: so I have recently added CoverTree support for KNN
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: a CoverTree if just an structure that allows to do faster k-neares neighbors, just in case you didn't hear about it (it was new for me too a couple of weeks ago)
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: I would like to see some examples of benchmarking, that shows that CoverTree is actually faster than the KNN we had before
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/cover_tree/cover_tree.html
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: something like that ^
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k: do you think guys that could be a good idea for a patch?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: I admit you become as lazy as me haha
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha :P I was planning to start with LARS or other thing then ;)
 blackburn	ah yeah
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw probably I can suggest you some other way of obtaining lasso pathwise solution
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me
 blackburn	from the SLEP that was referred by pluskid before
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, I took a look to the page
 pluskid	n4nd0: so you solved with a git pull? :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: which one do you like?
 emrecelikten	Okay, thanks. So I need to make some benchmarking tests then? How am I going to do it? Sample Octave programs?
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: the good thing here is that you may have freedom to select the language you want to use, if you like octave, octave would be cool
 n4nd0	pluskid: yeah, it add an empty merge but fixed it :)
 emrecelikten	Okay, good
 emrecelikten	n4nd0: Thanks! :)
 n4nd0	the only issue is that this is not yet in the central repository
 blackburn	n4nd0: actually group/tree/etc lasso are my task
 n4nd0	I have submitted the pull request this morning
 blackburn	n4nd0: but you can do simple L1
 n4nd0	blackburn: how could we fix this? so emrecelikten can do some benchmarking with cover tree even if it is not yet merged?
 blackburn	n4nd0: he can git pull git://github.com/iglesias/shogun yourbranchwithcovertree
* emrecelikten is taking notes
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: then that is probably the best to do
 pluskid	n4nd0: cool. I also got similar problem, I solved by deleting the remote branch on my github and push the new local branch there again -- an alternative solution :p
 n4nd0	pluskid: good to know :)
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: you can create a new branch locally and pull mine's
 emrecelikten	Okay, I will do this then. Maybe tonight or tomorrow, it will definitely be done until Sunday
 n4nd0	emrecelikten: ok, probably to use a famous dataset like iris, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris, for the benchmarking would be interesting
@sonney2k	n4nd0, look at mldata.org
@sonney2k	:D
 emrecelikten	Will do
@sonney2k	<ad>enough datasets all in a format easy to read </ad>

 emrecelikten	Especially in Shogun's 1-5 scale
 blackburn	I put a 4 to shogun actually
 blackburn	can it be an artifact of that effect? :)
 emrecelikten	Depends :P
 emrecelikten	but seriously, I know people that could put 4 to their C++ skills although they have used it less than half the amount
 emrecelikten	I said 2
 emrecelikten	half the amount that I used it*
 n4nd0	that's probably why it is always better to show one's skills and let others assess them
 n4nd0	at least in my opinion of course ;)
 emrecelikten	That's true, but if a student has no way of/time for showing it and the organization thinks that self-assessed scores are important then it's risky
 blackburn	I don't think it is the case
 emrecelikten	You might end up with a Dunning-Kruger'ed 2 while rejecting a Dunning-Kruger'ed 4 :P
 emrecelikten	Well not in here, of course
 emrecelikten	since you have to submit a patch :)
 blackburn	we have a lot of students there that showed their skills :)
* n4nd0 is looking up what Dunning-Kruger means ...

 emrecelikten	n4nd0: It's a cognitive bias
 emrecelikten	n4nd0: Unskilled people over-estimate their abilities while skilled people do the exact opposite
 emrecelikten	It's really interesting

 PhilTillet	sonney2k, did you have some time to try my patch?
 blackburn	sonney2k: libsvm was released on April,1st, I will diff it and update accordingly

 emrecelikten	sonney2k: I had a question about C5.0
 emrecelikten	sonney2k: How long do you think that project will take?
 emrecelikten	sonney2k: I don't think it will be longer than 5 weeks for a student working full time
-!- n4nd0 [~androirc@h121n3-ksg-a11.ias.bredband.telia.com] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	emrecelikten, hopefully not - I had in mind other tree implementations then
@sonney2k	e.g. port j45 / id3 ...
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am sorry if you get mails for every update :S
@sonney2k	no worries you will be busy
@sonney2k	were just a couple of hundred today
 emrecelikten	sonney2k: Very good. But I have prepared my proposal assuming that I will only be working on C5.0 for 10 weeks, I hope that's okay? I included that I thought it would be over much sooner and I would be able to take additional tasks in it though

@sonney2k	from 38 students
@sonney2k	last years acceptance rate of students was rather high (almost 30% http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2011/05/google-summer-of-code-where-are.html )
 n4nd0	Pie charts rock!
 PhilTillet	sonney2k, is there any other patch I can work on until next week, or are you already overwhelmed with patches? :p

 n4nd0_	sonney2k: apart from that, do you think it is ok?
@sonney2k	n4nd0_, as usual yes - and don't worry.
 n4nd0_	sonney2k: :) do you have any suggestion to work on after this?
 n4nd0_	sonney2k: is LARS ok or any other algorithm for lasso path? any other thing of interest?

@sonney2k	n4nd0_, what would help us most is to fix the test suite
@sonney2k	n4nd0_, so run tester.py and determine the examples that don't work
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.94.221] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	then figure out why by running tester.py -d filename.py
@sonney2k	to enter debug mode when sth is not the same
@sonney2k	p a will print object a
@sonney2k	p b will print object b
@sonney2k	and then one can check where they differ /how
 n4nd0_	ok, I will take a look to that then

 gsomix	sonney2k, can I switch to work with octave modular (sparse matrix typemap)? what else is needed for the python3 interface?
@sonney2k	gsomix, I don't know - I assume all examples run again?
@sonney2k	if so go ahead and do the octave modular sparse typemap.
@sonney2k	ask if you want a hint :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, hint? :]
@sonney2k	gsomix, help or so
 gsomix	sonney2k, I see. I thought that you have special hint for this.
@sonney2k	btw you should also fix the python_static examples' print stuff
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
@sonney2k	gsomix, well look at how it is done in interfaces/octave_static/OctaveInterface.cpp
@sonney2k	function COctaveInterface::get_sparse_matrix
@sonney2k	set_sparse_matrix
@sonney2k	basically copy and paste and rename this stuff and you are done
@sonney2k	ah and note that sparse matrices can only be of double type in octave
 gsomix	sonney2k, tnx. you make my life easier. :)
 gsomix	good night, guys
