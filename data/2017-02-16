 CaBa	HeikoS: i'm writing that quick and dirty version of the customkernel that we were talking about the other day right now ;)
@sukey	Wiki page: GSoC_2017_low_hanging_fruit edited on shogun-toolbox/shogun by karlnapf
@HeikoS	CaBa: hi
@HeikoS	yes
 CaBa	HeikoS: and i guess i'm running into problems that already came up with CustomKernel, so i thought to ask l)
 CaBa	HeikoS: for one, what is the scenario where lhs != rhs in a kernel? i guess that cannot be covered with precalculated kernels, right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	this is when you want to apply the method to a new datapoint
@HeikoS	i.e. you trained on X and then want to apply to Y that you havent seen when computing the kernel matrix for X
@HeikoS	so in that case you need to precompute the kernel between X and Y before you can predict
 CaBa	HeikoS: so how's that handled in the case of CCustomKernel? I saw some C++ code where ->set_kernel() was called with the testing precalc matrix...
@HeikoS	you need to provide the kernel if you want to predict on new data
@HeikoS	as f(x) = \sum_i alpha_i k(x_new, x_i)
@HeikoS	wiking: jo around?
@HeikoS	I got back from gunnar! finally :)
@wiking	HeikoS, yes
@wiking	sup?
@HeikoS	- Feb 21, 2 or 3pm- Feb 22, 10 or 11am
@HeikoS	whats better=?
@HeikoS	the 11am I guess?
@wiking	11 yes
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	let me reply
@wiking	but i can do 3 if need be
@HeikoS	10 is better?
@HeikoS	because it is 10 or 11
@wiking	either is fine
@HeikoS	ok then 11 better for me
@HeikoS	wiking: cool
@HeikoS	Ill write a little plan until then so we can present concrete things to gunnar and he just has to yes/no them
@HeikoS	wiking: saw this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3534#issuecomment-280154766
@HeikoS	is that the one you warn about in cmake?
@HeikoS	could do that as well and disable the test for that version?
@wiking	dunno yet
@wiking	i have to finish somethng
@HeikoS	kk
 CaBa	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_svmlight_string_features_precomputed_kernel.cpp#L110
 CaBa	HeikoS: so that's the training / testing scheme for custom kernel?

@HeikoS	CaBa: kind of
@HeikoS	just here all data is known at training time
@HeikoS	do you can precompute the test kernel matri xas well
@HeikoS	but yeah
@HeikoS	you see below that the precomputed test kernel matrices are passed
@HeikoS	so it is that
 CaBa	ah, so one approach is to concat training + testing data, then subset for training and subset for testing?
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	that is just one way to do it
@HeikoS	but you could also imagine
@HeikoS	you traing your model on all data
-!- goksinen [~goksinen@rrcs-50-75-193-138.nyc.biz.rr.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
@HeikoS	and then, afterwards, you get new test data
@HeikoS	and then you compute the kernel between train and test (no subsetting)
@HeikoS	and then prediuct
@HeikoS	here it is done with the subsetting since all data is known from the start
 CaBa	yes. which will be the case for my usecase, too. sure, generally it is desirable to be able to work with new data at a later time
 CaBa	HeikoS: is there a code snippet for "solution 1" somewhere?
@HeikoS	CaBa: no dont think so
@HeikoS	but it is easy
@HeikoS	you just need to create the km_test matrix in your snippet above manually
@HeikoS	without subsetting

 CaBa	HeikoS: when CCustomKernel is initialized with a matrix, it creates CIndexFeatures somewhere internally?
-!- goksinen [~goksinen@rrcs-50-75-193-138.nyc.biz.rr.com] has joined #shogun
 mikeling	hi HeikoS: I found there are several sub-projects for Shogun detox 2, is that mean I need to pick some sub-projects from them if I want to work on Shogun detox 2 as GSoC project?
@HeikoS	CaBa: I think so
@HeikoS	mikeling: hi!
 CaBa	HeikoS: i can't find that anywhere...
@HeikoS	mikeling: yeah we will probably not be able to do them all
@HeikoS	mikeling: this list will need to be made much more concrete
 mikeling	Sp, is Shogun detox 2 an independent project ? is that possible more than one students work on it?
@HeikoS	mikeling: it also depends on how much of the last years projects we manage to fully integrate until gsoc 2016 starts
@HeikoS	mikeling: I think it will be independent, but maybe a small subproject will be soved by another student, like the efficiency one or others
@HeikoS	CaBa: why?
 CaBa	HeikoS: well i'm currently using 1-dimensional CDenseFeatures<uint32_t> for my own custom kernel hack, was wondering if CIndexFeatures would be more straight forward to use. so i was looking whether i can see them in action somewher
@HeikoS	CaBa: I currently dont have a good idea in my head what the IndexFeatures do, but I did not write that stuff initially
 CaBa	^^
 mikeling	HeikoS: great! Thank you for your kindly explanation :)
 CaBa	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/kernel/CustomKernel.cpp#L105
@HeikoS	mikeling: no worries, looking forward to your application
 CaBa	HeikoS: looks as if CDummyFeatures are used and not CIndexFeatures
@HeikoS	mikeling: definitely have a look at the cereal / tags / linalg branch from last years gsoc
 mikeling	HeikoS: great! Thank you for your kindly explanation :)
 CaBa	HeikoS: whereas i don't understand why this is initialized with 2 dummy features, one for kmatrix rows and one for cols... it should reflect the number of feature vectors, right? O.o

@wiking	ok this was a big one
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	subsetting... is that a kernel thing or a feature thing?
 CaBa	feature it seems. and seems like dummyfeatures don't really support it but indexfeatures do. in a rather expensive fashion O.o
