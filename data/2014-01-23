@sonney2k	iglesiasg, heya!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hola holita
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, any news from heiko? I thought he had his last exam yesterday...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, haven't heard from him at all
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, if he did have it yesterday, maybe he is relaxing a little bit
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, about the KMeans PR
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, Parijat created a couple of files with a couple of functions that are not inside any class or so
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, do you think that is fine?
@iglesiasg	I would rather see it in something similar to the LMNNImpl class, but it might be just a matter of taste
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yeah please put it into some class - even some utility class if it is generic stuff
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw have you seen cwidmers push attempt to master?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I have seen something weird there yeah
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, I better check who has write permissions
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I was wondering if it was a pull request or sth
@sonney2k	and drop all but the core team members
@iglesiasg	hehe
@sonney2k	I mean PRs are just fine
@iglesiasg	indeed
@iglesiasg	many times I even prefer to do a PR and wait for someone else to see it and merge it
@iglesiasg	providing they are not pretty obvious things
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, actually it is just us with push rights
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so what was it that chris did?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, seems like nothing: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/818#issuecomment-33133535
@sonney2k	wiking, is this coveralls running??! https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/818#issuecomment-33133535
@iglesiasg	hehe funny thing this one
@sonney2k	totally weird imho!
@wiking	sonney2k: heheh yeah i have no idea why that came today
@sonney2k	wiking, totally confusing...
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=shogun
@sonney2k	I think we should all subscribe to stackoverflow and answer Q's there
@wiking	i did answer one
@wiking	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17305470/libsvm-file-format-for-shogun/18915042#18915042
@iglesiasg	is there a way to get mails when people ask about Shogun?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, there must be...
@sonney2k	wiking, I answered one too
@sonney2k	wiking, a year ago and then forgot how I logged in...
@sonney2k	I guess that is me - but wtf is this http://stackoverflow.com/users/1883021/soeren-sonnenburg?tab=activity ?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, what???! isn't it that your user?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, no idea I don't know which email I used or anything...
