 Ram108	hi..... thr?
 sonne|work	Good morning...
 Ram108	hi mr sonnenburg
 Ram108	Mr Lisitsyn helped me to set up some classifiers but i could not get it to work
 Ram108	i was wondering if either of u could aid me a little more
 sonne|work	please be more specific - just directly ask the question
 blackburn	Ram108: how can I help you?
 Ram108	sorry for the delay
 Ram108	well i have created the RealFeatures and Labels and KNN requires  train and test vector sets..... how do i generate them from the dataset
 Ram108	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data is the data set he asked me to classify

 Ram108	hi
 Ram108	Mr. Lisitsyn can u help me out with the rest of the implementation
 blackburn	yes, but call me more informal, I'm too young to be mr :D
 Ram108	lo, :) okay sure :)
 blackburn	how can i help you?
 Ram108	well i have created the RealFeatures and Labels. KNN requires  train and test vector sets
 Ram108	are test and train vectors created by handpicking some out of the data set
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	so?
 blackburn	ah, it is a question? :)
 Ram108	so shill i create that...... and then use KNN
 Ram108	?
 blackburn	yes, you have to create RealFeatures and Labels for train vectors and RealFeatures for test vectors
 blackburn	example:
 blackburn	[1,2,3] label 0
 blackburn	[3,4,5] label 0
 blackburn	[9,8,7] label 1
 blackburn	and test set
 blackburn	[0,1,2]
 blackburn	[7,8,6]
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 blackburn	feature matrix for train set is
 blackburn	[[1,3,9],
 blackburn	 [2,4,8]
 blackburn	 [3,5,7]]
 blackburn	then labels are [0,0,1]
 blackburn	same for test set
 blackburn	it should be done in this fashion
 Ram108	hmmm :)
 Ram108	thanks :)
 blackburn	then after applying you will get probably [0,1] for this data
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 blackburn	after that you can compare labels that you've got with classifier and 'ground truth' labels
 Ram108	well i have created Real features bu calling the RealFeatures() and labels by invoking the Label() method
 blackburn	and?
 Ram108	and now i ll have to create a seperate test and train set by spooling a few samples and making then into the form vector1=[5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2] and label 0 for Iris-setosa
 Ram108	likewise for all the other test and train examples
 blackburn	separate it before creating RealFeatures
 Ram108	[[vec1],[vec2],[vec3]......] and labels [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.... ]
 Ram108	yeah i think i got it
 blackburn	ok
 Ram108	i ll code it to u and email u the file
 blackburn	okay
 Ram108	its just a simple modification to the old file i sent yesterday right?
 blackburn	something like that
 Ram108	hmmm :)
 Ram108	thanks a lot..... am i bugging u?
 Ram108	sorry if i am....

 puneetgoyal	hello :) can you please tell RealFeatures function?
 Ram108	hi puneet
 puneetgoyal	what all datatype are handled in RealFeatures function?
 puneetgoyal	hello Ram :)
 Ram108	heard u r another guy wanting to learn this toolbox out
 Ram108	:P
 puneetgoyal	yeah...I guess you have already done this...can you please help me out with this
 Ram108	well all i did was....
 Ram108	can i email u my code?
 Ram108	do u have skype or sumthn?
 puneetgoyal	check out the other window
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.96.211.205] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
 blackburn	RealFeatures is not a function, it is a class
 puneetgoyal	yeah..I mean to ask what arguments does it take? blackburn ?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: numpy matrix
 puneetgoyal	I have seen the class...it says some dotfeatures
 blackburn	RealFeatures is a SimpleFeatures<float64_t>
 blackburn	and SimpleFeatures is inherited from DotFeatures
 puneetgoyal	ok...but float64 is only for floating variable right? so how do we let it work for strings?
 blackburn	StringFeatures
 puneetgoyal	but it says StringFeatures is not defined...do I have to import some another file for this?
 sonne|work	StringCharFeatures ...
 puneetgoyal	ok..thank you :)
 puneetgoyal	and while creating a numpy matrix again we have to define a datatype...what if we have both float and character variables inside the data? we can use the object datatype..but I guess there is no class for it to convert it into feature matrix

 Ram108	puneeth r u thr?
 puneetgoyal	yup Ram108
 Ram108	call me ram
 puneetgoyal	oh thats just to give you a notification
 Ram108	:)
 Ram108	well do u want me to email u my code?
 Ram108	its pretty shoddy though
 puneetgoyal	thanks... I figured it out...there was a silly error in my data file :P
 Ram108	hmmm did u figure out the whole classification thinge?
 Ram108	i havent reached till that yet
 Ram108	having trouble
 puneetgoyal	I just needed the realfeature matrix to get going for svm classification for now
 Ram108	well? could u help me out with that?
 puneetgoyal	yeah..sure...tell me
 Ram108	well i guess i formed the RealFeature matrix and label
 Ram108	and now i am supposed to generate test and train vectors
 Ram108	well do u have an example for that?
 puneetgoyal	ok and what's the problem?
 Ram108	well i am nt really clear hw that shld look like
 Ram108	if i had an example i could follow it easily :)
 puneetgoyal	have you seen the undocumented examples?

 Ram108	yeah but i really want to classify http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
 puneetgoyal	using what classifier?
 puneetgoyal	which classifier?
 Ram108	KNN
 puneetgoyal	there is an example classifier_knn
 Ram108	yeah k thanks
 puneetgoyal	just replace your matrix with its matrix
 Ram108	k thanks :)
 Ram108	were did u exactly find it?
 puneetgoyal	undocumented examples

 puneetgoyal	hey ....can I have these data files... fm_train_real.dat, fm_test_real.dat and label_train_twoclass.dat
 blackburn	git submodule update
@sonney2k	git submodule update --init
 blackburn	second is better hehe
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you have a chance to pack a .deb?
@sonney2k	hmmhh sth went wrong - the .tar.bz2 is >300M
 puneetgoyal	thanks :)
 blackburn	heh
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.240.38.83] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@sonney2k	blackburn, mind preparing release notes that you can send out to the shogun mailinglist when I give you the go
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: you mean some announcement on release of 1.1.0?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	well I could
@sonney2k	just copy what is on the website/ what I posted and add some brief summary - I guess this time it is mostly compile fixes, speedup compilation + your preproc/converter stuff
 blackburn	website?
 blackburn	what did you posted?
@sonney2k	check the 1.0.0 announcement on the mailinglist
 blackburn	hmm ok
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.240.38.83] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: should I send it?
@sonney2k	not yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you please have a look at the .tar.bz2 I generated?
@sonney2k	I had to redo it manually...
@sonney2k	seems like my release script still has a bug
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm sure, where can I find it?
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://www.shogun-toolbox.org :-)
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you had experience of linking shogun and MKL?
@sonney2k	I have no time for that now
 blackburn	I tried this morning and failed :)
@sonney2k	lets get the release out and then I have to sleep ASAP
 blackburn	heh sure, I'm just asked whether you had
@sonney2k	have to get up in ~5 hrs
@sonney2k	flying to granada / nips tomorrow
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	ehm
@sonney2k	blackburn, so does it compile?
 blackburn	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `.depend', needed by `libshogun.so.11.0'.  Stop.
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	blackburn, well did you run configure??
 blackburn	I'm not an idiot yet :D
 blackburn	does it compile smoothly on your machine?
@sonney2k	great then sth went wrong
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know the problem?
@sonney2k	no I don't understand what is going on
 blackburn	I faced this error before but do not know how to solve it
 blackburn	what is .depend?
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw make called in / leads to 'fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git'
@sonney2k	why didn't you tell me?
 blackburn	sonney2k: did not tell what?
@sonney2k	that you have seen this error at some point
 blackburn	well it disappeared and I faced it I guess 10000 years ago
 blackburn	don't you have this problem?
@sonney2k	never had
@sonney2k	but now I do
 blackburn	haah
@sonney2k	I cannot easily fix this problem...
 blackburn	why depend is not generated?
@sonney2k	I found the problem
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the problem? are you a sorcerer?
@sonney2k	please try again
@sonney2k	it should work now
 blackburn	again..
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	sonney2k: works
@sonney2k	great
@sonney2k	then send out this email

 blackburn	sonney2k: done
 blackburn	you can sleep with accomplished mood I guess :)
@sonney2k	well we should also announce on freshmeat / mloss.org / and I should write a blog entry / g+
@sonney2k	but otherwise yes
@sonney2k	I will do this tomorrow on the ride to the airport...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I can announce on G+
 blackburn	should I?
@sonney2k	so better get *some* hours of sleep now
 blackburn	sure, sleep well
@sonney2k	sure why not - it won't hurt if I do it too later :)
@sonney2k	nite
 blackburn	I will be short
 blackburn	Shogun 1.1.0 is out
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	see you
 puneetgoyal	awesome!
-!- alesis-novik [~alesis@5ac5713d.bb.sky.com] has joined #shogun
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, I was too distracted and forgot to reply to your e-mail
 alesis-novik	I use the vector in GMM just for storing separate Gaussians, not as a mathematical concept(?)
 alesis-novik	Was that what you were asking?
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, I was asking if you could change it to Dynarray or so
 shogun-buildbot	build #384 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_static/builds/384  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 alesis-novik	Congratulations on getting 1.1.0 out guys!
@sonney2k	alesis-novik, because I want to make vector a mathematical thing like v+u = w
@sonney2k	which won't work with your gaussians
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, well, you can technically add Gaussians, though it wouldn't make any sense in this context
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, so is that still an open problem?
@sonney2k	yes so please convert it then to Dynamic / Dynarray
@sonney2k	yes
 alesis-novik	I have some time now since it's close to Christmas and research has slowed down
 alesis-novik	sonney2k, I'll do it over the next few days then
@sonney2k	great!
@sonney2k	then I can continue my SGVector effort :)
 alesis-novik	I'd like to have more time to work on Shogun, but lately I've been working on my own topic, so not really enough time :/
