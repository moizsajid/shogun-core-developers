 n4nd0	blackburn: it was fine, no problem
 blackburn	hmm no idea there was some net split I guess
 n4nd0	the plne was half empty
 n4nd0	I had a full row (three seats) just for me :)
 n4nd0	you know, I had never really thought of it before
 n4nd0	but Spain is warm .... pretty warm

 blackburn	pluskid: I can add primal and dual formulation of crammer-singer (I derived it once) to the multiclass part
 pluskid	blackburn: cool!
 pluskid	I'm about to asking you about that :D
 blackburn	pluskid: do you think we should have detailed derivations of such stuff?
 pluskid	so a netsplit cause half of the plane into another space? :D
 blackburn	actually in papers and books they are usually do not derive it
 blackburn	yes probably
 pluskid	blackburn: I don't know the crammer-singer derivation, I think we'd better only add short derivations
 pluskid	blackburn: btw, I saw the skeleton of the "essentials" part, you are not going to finish all those before you die, haha :D
 blackburn	why? I am pretty interested in that stuff
 pluskid	blackburn: I mean there are soooooo many contents
 blackburn	well 10-20 pages :D
 pluskid	no, you should be able to write 600 pages for that part :D
 pluskid	like vapnik's book
 blackburn	lets see :)

 blackburn	pluskid: so yuo are going to MIT?
 pluskid	blackburn: right after GSoC
 blackburn	pluskid: what are you going to research there?
 pluskid	machine learning :D
 pluskid	specific topic not decided yet
 blackburn	I hope you will manage to use shogun and extend it through research
 pluskid	yeah, hope so :)

 blackburn	pluskid: I see you are interested in VC too :D
 pluskid	blackburn: VC you mean VC-theory?
 blackburn	yeah
 pluskid	blackburn: yeah, I'm pretty interested in that :D
 blackburn	pluskid: however google translates your blog pretty bad
 pluskid	blackburn: haha, let me try it
 blackburn	pluskid: well actually sometimes pretty well
 blackburn	but sometimes I find it hard to parse :)
 pluskid	oops, beautiful margin-notes and equations disappeared :D
 pluskid	one of my classmate actually use google translate literally for an assignment of paper translation (into chinese)
 pluskid	and the teacher didn't notice it
 pluskid	(though I guess the teacher never looked at the assignments)
 blackburn	heh
 pluskid	ahh... I tried to read some fragments, and feel completely unreadable...
 pluskid	but google translate is the state of the art, right?
 blackburn	no idea about that actually
 blackburn	CIA should has something better to translate secret chinese docs :D
 blackburn	argh have*
 pluskid	no no
 pluskid	they must have human translators

@sonney2k	blackburn, why did you remove size() from sgvector?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it conflicts with csharp stuff
 blackburn	I'd prefer not to touch csharp :)
 blackburn	could break things
 blackburn	but actually I'd like to have stl-like interface in vector
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw gmm is back
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok so we can just put it back and rename it for c# then
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but I don't want to touch csharp typemaps actually :)

@sonney2k	blackburn, seen that - nice work!
 blackburn	sonney2k: but with std::vector actually :D
 blackburn	instead of sgvector
 blackburn	however could be changed
@sonney2k	seen that too and I guess I will convert it to dynarray at some point :-]
 blackburn	should be easy actually
 blackburn	if dynarray supports []
@sonney2k	it does
@sonney2k	however std:: is a nogo certainly for header files - for the rest I guess I will have to live with whatever you do...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I hope the buildbot gets happy again...
 blackburn	sonney2k: why not to put into headers?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well for serialized fields yes for sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you want to write a makefile for tutorial? ;)
@sonney2k	compile time++
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	blackburn, why me?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am lame with it still (crying)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I first have to take care of the PRs
@sonney2k	blackburn, is n4nd0's PR OK?
@sonney2k	blackburn, but we shouldn't merge anything before we get the buildbot back to green
 blackburn	hmm let me check it again
 blackburn	isn't it all green now?
@sonney2k	nothing is
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, n4nd0  should get USE_MOSEK guards back
 blackburn	not to merge it right now
@sonney2k	blackburn, err? I think he did?
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	right
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	I was confused with no commit after
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/213/steps/test%20cmdline_static/logs/stdio that fails for no real reason
@sonney2k	blackburn, well due to the test restructuring of wiking/heiko
@sonney2k	I tried to fix it just now
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you understand the MatrixFeatures n4nd0 introduced?
@sonney2k	I dont' understand the doc
 blackburn	sonney2k: well yeah a little
 blackburn	sonney2k: feature vector = matrix
@sonney2k	why such a weird name?
 blackburn	sonney2k: because it contains a set of matrices
@sonney2k	I guess underneath it is treated as vector again
@sonney2k	blackburn, no I mean feature vector
@sonney2k	I think he should also rather use sth like NDArray to set the matrices
@sonney2k	no idea how to do it for matrices of different size though
@sonney2k	(and we have no typemaps to work with these features...)

@sonney2k	blackburn, there is this one typemap I have no idea how to fix for c#
@sonney2k	blackburn, when you have some method that gets >1 SGVector or so as argument
@sonney2k	then the build will fail for c#
 blackburn	oooh
 blackburn	interesting
@sonney2k	so the only fix I have is to %ignore that method for c#
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess you didn't revert that typemap %ignore thing...
@sonney2k	it should have been in interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i
@sonney2k	in the #ifdef SWIGCSHARP section
 blackburn	okay I see
 blackburn	will add it then
 blackburn	sonney2k: so I can get size back then
@sonney2k	hehe
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@114.Red-2-137-6.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	hi sonney2k
 n4nd0	let me ask you, how do you prefer that I introduce the changes you have commented in the pull request?
 n4nd0	new commit or ammending?
 n4nd0	I remember once you said something about amend better
@sonney2k	blackburn, please also have a look at pluskid's PR again - he explained why he needs a kernel factory
 n4nd0	however, that would require to force the push and I am not really confident whether it is good to do that
@sonney2k	blackburn, in principle he needs to *create* kernels of a certain type
@sonney2k	though I dont' really understand why
@sonney2k	n4nd0, amend is better ... there are certainly enough commits already in this PR
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw good that you are here
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I don't understand the matrix features doc
 blackburn	that kind of factory could be replaced by copy constructor I think
 blackburn	or some clone()
 n4nd0	sonney2k: probably the documentation about it is not very elaborated :S
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean if pluskid needs to create a new kernel then it will have no arguments set!
@sonney2k	so it cannot give reasonable results !?
@sonney2k	I must be missing sth
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so please explain again :D
 n4nd0	sonney2k: there is a type in the doc now that I read it again
@sonney2k	typo?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is caused by the first variable length matrix features I created, and later I went to MatrixFeatures
 n4nd0	yeah, typo, sorry
 n4nd0	sonney2k: however ammending you won't be able to note the new changes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, your PR is just too big

@sonney2k	why didn't you just send a PR for matrixfeautres?
 n4nd0	sorry about that :(
@sonney2k	and then others for isolated changes?
 n4nd0	because I couldn't develop first the whole MatrixFeatures and later the HM-SVM, etc

 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have introduced the changes you told me in github and modify the MatrixFeatures doc, please tell me if now is more comprehensible
 n4nd0	sonney2k: are you familiarized with hmsvm toolbox?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, no - I know the theory / concepts though
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, so the TwoState model is used for the state representation of the markov model
 n4nd0	sonney2k: the TwoState model is the simplest example
 n4nd0	sonney2k: it is needed because the labels do not represent directly the states in the model
 n4nd0	though the labels are strictly related with the states

 blackburn	:(
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so a toy example right?
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf513ae0 / src/interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i : Fixed syntax error in includes - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/f513ae0cc314956dc39a5a7f8b66639f062e44aa
 n4nd0	sonney2k: not really
 n4nd0	it covers any HM-SVM application where the labels can take two different values
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you understand what I mean?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so it could be used for sth like background vs. foreground in images etc right?
@sonney2k	image segmentation I mean
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, for example
 n4nd0	yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw everything currently only works with mosek right?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, but according to what wiking and uricamic told me yesterday
 n4nd0	if I define a risk function for the HMSVM model
 blackburn	explain! how can I represent image as markov model?
 n4nd0	I could use uricamic bundle methods, that is really cool
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is not really an image what you can represent as a markov model
 n4nd0	blackburn: because there is no time variance there
 n4nd0	blackburn: but for example imagine a video sequence
 blackburn	okay sequence, what's next?
 n4nd0	blackburn: take a window of the video sequence
 n4nd0	you could model that as an markov model
 blackburn	ehmmmmm
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that should really have a high priority then - otherwise the code you added cannot be used :/
 n4nd0	say I want to know whether this region is in foreground or backbround
 blackburn	window like some area of image right?
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure
 blackburn	so you just go through all image
 n4nd0	maybe you could do that to
 n4nd0	but what I was thinking is
 blackburn	hmm I see
 n4nd0	you fix your window
 n4nd0	and run the video sequence
 blackburn	but actually I agree with soeren we should make it usable not only with mosek
 n4nd0	for each frame (or image) you model if that window is in background or foreground
 n4nd0	blackburn, sonney2k: I agree with you guys
 blackburn	okay so you get something like
 blackburn	fore - back - fore - back - back
 blackburn	for frames
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	those would be the hidden states
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I still don't get the description
 n4nd0	sonney2k: of MatrixFeatures?
@sonney2k	for matrix feats
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, can you just explain here please?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure
 n4nd0	so with dot features we have things like
 n4nd0	x1 = [1, 0, -1, 4, 5]
 n4nd0	x2 = [-4, 9, 7, 6, 5]
 n4nd0	x3 = ...
 n4nd0	each xi is a feature vector
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok?
 n4nd0	the feature 1 of x1 takes the value 1, of x2 takes the value -4
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4ec77d8 / src/interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i : fix %ignore - SGVector is of type index_t not float... - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/4ec77d80012857ffdeb8eae2c6314699f160a683
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, I hope this commit fixes the build finally...
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	sure index t
 blackburn	thnask
 n4nd0	in matrix features each xi is a matrix
 n4nd0	x1 = [ 1,  0,  4;
 n4nd0	       2, -1,  3]
 n4nd0	x2 = [ 4, -3,  2,  5;
 n4nd0	      -6,  5,  0, -3]
 n4nd0	again each xi is a feature vector
 n4nd0	I don't really like to say feature vector because now they are represented as matrices
 n4nd0	I like to use more example
 n4nd0	anyway
 n4nd0	now
 n4nd0	the feature 1 of x1 is [1 0 4], and of x2 [4 -3 2 5]
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok so you basically have matrices as examples right?
@sonney2k	do they all have the same size?
 n4nd0	NOTE: in MatrixFeatures each of the features are the columns, while in this toy example they are the rows
@sonney2k	I mean same nr of rows/cols?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: now about the sizes
 n4nd0	they must have the same number of features
@sonney2k	features?
 n4nd0	BUT the features don't need to have the same length among examples
 n4nd0	yes
@sonney2k	== rows?
 n4nd0	in my example ^, the same number of rows
 n4nd0	in MatrixFeatures, the same number of columns
 n4nd0	but as you see above, the other dimension is not the same for all the examples
 n4nd0	sonney2k: am I making it clear or not?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, why do they have to have the same number of columns?
 n4nd0	there is another point of view that may make more sense
 n4nd0	sonney2k: where? in the example above or in MatrixFeatures?
@sonney2k	it is not crystal clear yet
@sonney2k	in MatrixFeatures
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I first thought it is basiclly an array of matrices of same size
 n4nd0	it is almost that
 shogun-buildbot_	build #261 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile csharp_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/261  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	it is an array of matrices with the same number of columns
@sonney2k	now you say it is basically an array of matrices where the matrices have the same number of columns
 n4nd0	yes, it is that
@sonney2k	that is much much easier to understand
@sonney2k	but still doesn't explain why this restriction is needed!
@sonney2k	and what one can do with this
 n4nd0	the restriction is needed because you need to have the same number of features for all the examples
 n4nd0	imagine dotfeatures where x1 has 4 elements and x2 three
@sonney2k	the term features creates a parse error for me here
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	features != feature vector
 n4nd0	so what I said
 n4nd0	in DotFeatures
 n4nd0	all the examples have the same number of features
 n4nd0	(otherwise we are talking about StringFeatures)
 n4nd0	in my MatrixFeatures this is still the same, same number of features
 n4nd0	therefore, the restriction of the same number of columns arises
 n4nd0	2) about what can one do with this: train HM-SVMs :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: closer to crystal clear?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, closer but what do the different nr of rows stand for?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am currently thinking if it would not be better to have a general matrix features type with that restriction removed (or at least optional)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: sure it could be
 n4nd0	I don't think that actually I coded this restriction in the MatrixFeatures
 n4nd0	although I use it in the HM-SVM
 n4nd0	because there the restriction exists
 n4nd0	but I am sure about this
 n4nd0	*not* sure
 n4nd0	sonney2k: so, are we ok now or should I explain something else?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I understand that now - though the doc is not too clear
@sonney2k	but I would really like to have these matrix features to be more general
@sonney2k	otherwise we need to have one more class
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, you are right
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I am opening an issue in github for me, ok?
@sonney2k	one thing that is not so easy to understand to me
 n4nd0	tell me
@sonney2k	momplz
@sonney2k	n4nd0, ok back
@sonney2k	n4nd0, how do we feed data into the matrixfeatures?
@sonney2k	I mean I could imagine we use SGNDArray to put in matrices of same size

 n4nd0	sonney2k: one way you can currently do is feeding matrix by matrix
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I guess you might not see the problem but it is related to how all the interfaces currently work - we have typemaps aka conversion routines that convert e.g. a numpy array into shogun's dense features
 n4nd0	sonney2k: if you don't want to restrict that the matrices are of the same size, then I think that an SGNDArray is not appropriate
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so I guess one way to do it would be to put in a list of numpy matrices
 n4nd0	yes
@sonney2k	but we could as well have a new SG* data type for that then
@sonney2k	e.g. for strings we have SGStringList
@sonney2k	so we could have SGMatrixList
 n4nd0	yeah, I think that makes sense
 shogun-buildbot_	build #262 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/262  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you think it would be better having an SGMatrixList <--- SGReferencedData rather than the SGMatrix*?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we do this already for SGSparseMatrix
@sonney2k	...and will do it for stringfeautres too so this would be the consistent way
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ seen the buildbot is still unhappy
@sonney2k	blackburn, new error though
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not understand it
 blackburn	tests related again as I can see
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah and wiking hides somewhere and doesn't want to fix the bugs he introduced :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, can you do these changes (introducing SGMatrixList?)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: is "in the long run" a valid answer? :-O
 n4nd0	I'd prefer to get the plifs, coffin, try uricamic's bundle methods first
@sonney2k	n4nd0, c'mon this will take you 4 hours max
@sonney2k	gtg now sry
