@HeikoS	lisitsyn: jo
@HeikoS	around?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: hi
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes but was heading to bed
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: whats up?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: quick question
@HeikoS	I got a friend who is interested in helping us during GSoC
 lisitsyn	oh cool
@HeikoS	mostly for community managment
@HeikoS	that is: polishing the wiki
@HeikoS	organising things
@HeikoS	making sure we communicate well
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: problem is
 lisitsyn	oh that's pretty good
@HeikoS	wiki access only can be gratned with full write access
@HeikoS	and everything else is annoying
@HeikoS	(sending changes per email, or other)
@HeikoS	as wiki doesnt allow for PRs
@HeikoS	other option is to make the wiki publicly editable
@HeikoS	but thats not good either
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: got any suggestion?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: she doesnt want to change code anyways, so I thought of just adding to the team and she only touches the wiki
@HeikoS	but not optimal
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see you created Wikiers team
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah
 lisitsyn	I was thinking if that's possible with teams
 lisitsyn	but not sure
@HeikoS	but no use
@HeikoS	no I dont think so
@HeikoS	since we dont have a seperate repo for the wiki
@HeikoS	or do we have that?
 lisitsyn	no
 lisitsyn	it's no repo I think
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so what to do?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: add with full push rights? do via email?
@HeikoS	I kind of want to give away polishing the wiki
 lisitsyn	actually not use github wiki :D
@HeikoS	not put every change in myself, then no time is saved
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how easy is it to migrate?
 lisitsyn	hard
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok then no
 lisitsyn	and no good alternative I can see
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	ok ok
 lisitsyn	just a second
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is write permission good?
 lisitsyn	or it is admin?
@HeikoS	I think write should be ok
@HeikoS	dont you think?
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	Restrict editing to users in teams with push access only.
 lisitsyn	Public wikis will still be readable by everyone.
 lisitsyn	ok write permission is more or less ok
 lisitsyn	admin is a bit more dangerous you know
@HeikoS	I know
@HeikoS	whole point why I ask ;)
 lisitsyn	ok then probably I don't mind..
@HeikoS	do you think I can just go ahead without chasing everyone first?
@HeikoS	asking for opinion?
 lisitsyn	yeah I think it is ok, not sure anyone is bothered a lot
 lisitsyn	oh have you seen they added protected branches
 lisitsyn	to avoid push force
@HeikoS	i invited
@HeikoS	can you help me with that?
 lisitsyn	I protected master and develop
@HeikoS	see the team page
@HeikoS	ok thats good
@HeikoS	so no push -f
 lisitsyn	yes this will not work
 lisitsyn	even if you're write accessed
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	ok
 lisitsyn	in teams we have
 lisitsyn	wikiers - write access
@HeikoS	any idea how to allow the wiki team write access
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	I just added that
@HeikoS	so anyone who I put in there will be able to write wiki
 lisitsyn	should work I believe
@HeikoS	and to push changes
@HeikoS	but no push -f
 lisitsyn	yeah
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	thanks
 lisitsyn	so even malicious thing won't happen
 lisitsyn	well some bad commit but no lost history
@HeikoS	push can still happen
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	see gunnar
@HeikoS	yeah agreed
 lisitsyn	easy to repair
 lisitsyn	ok easier
 lisitsyn	not that easy :)
 lisitsyn	ok so lea?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	lets see how that goes
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	I have the hope to outsource some of the million things I have to do during gsoc
@HeikoS	like someone to read the wiki pages and update
@HeikoS	or make sure they make sense
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is she going to be at irc?
@HeikoS	or actually play user for the GSoC projects
@HeikoS	yes Ill get her there
 lisitsyn	ok cool
 lisitsyn	it is still the main thing for me
@HeikoS	same here
@HeikoS	gunnars thing wasnt good
 lisitsyn	mailing list is slow and heere we can decide things
@HeikoS	push based
@HeikoS	I agree
 lisitsyn	ok lets see how it goes
@HeikoS	great
@HeikoS	thanks for you help and feedback
@HeikoS	looking good our application
@HeikoS	I will add one more project that sonney2k actually agreed to mentor
@HeikoS	on approximate kernel methods ;)
@HeikoS	haha
 lisitsyn	no worries
@HeikoS	and I might have  tensorflow project as well
 lisitsyn	yeah thats cool
 lisitsyn	tensorflow..
 lisitsyn	yeah we can use that
 lisitsyn	ok have to go
 lisitsyn	see you

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: got a minute?
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	sure
 lisitsyn	even a few
 lisitsyn	working day today but a bit more calm
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	nice
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok so cookbook
@HeikoS	I dont know if you saw this:
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Google%20Summer%20of%20Code%202016%20Projects
@HeikoS	I had the idea of making the cookbook an additionaal project that is tackled jointly
@HeikoS	so we need a few things
@HeikoS	first is a description (I will do that)
@HeikoS	but then we want the thing to get ready so that we can easily accept patches for it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so wanted to ask what we need for that in your eyes
@HeikoS	we kind of want to be careful that if we get 100 contributions for it, that we dont have to touch them again at some later pojnt
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how to ensure what?
 lisitsyn	ok let me check
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: cookbook is sphinx, right?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes
@HeikoS	feature branch also
 lisitsyn	ok ok
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: cross review?
 lisitsyn	like in coursera?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: we can ask for reviewers somewhere
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yoyo
@HeikoS	sorry door
 lisitsyn	np
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: review is just the same as last gsoc
@HeikoS	we ask them to try each others stuff and suggest improvements
@HeikoS	and we make pairs
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	but that is not the new thing
 lisitsyn	we can make not pairs
 lisitsyn	but 1-N
 lisitsyn	OvA
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah also possible
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	haha ;)
@HeikoS	If they know svm
@HeikoS	but about the cookbook
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: lea might prganise that one
 lisitsyn	ok so what do you want to ensure?
@HeikoS	so that someone tracks that people actually do stuff there
@HeikoS	And also for entrance task
@HeikoS	so it should be easy to add something and things shoudl be in place
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@host-92-0-162-192.as43234.net] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this is what I want to discuss
@HeikoS	ah speaking of the devil
@HeikoS	lisitsyn meet leagoetz who is the wiki mastermind now
 lisitsyn	leagoetz: nice to meet you
 lisitsyn	that's great you want to help because we are all too busy/lazy
 lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	haha, mostly lazy
 leagoetz	hi there
 leagoetz	lisitsyn: good to meet you :)
 lisitsyn	sooo HeikoS you want to enforce that they do this thing?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: if they dont do it, leagoetz fails them  ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no idea really
 leagoetz	I could do that :)
@HeikoS	more like encourage them to
@HeikoS	you know its actually a cool thing
 lisitsyn	yeap
@HeikoS	one can think about which methods to add, learn a bit, try things
@HeikoS	and then if we have some sort of weekly meetings on this, where we track things
@HeikoS	I think that should be motivation enough
@HeikoS	just need someone  to actually run after ppl
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: for me the question is more about actually making it easy to contribute to the cookbook
 lisitsyn	ah that's technical
@HeikoS	so that is feels exciting, rather than annoying
 lisitsyn	but should be a bit pushed forward
 lisitsyn	it works now but there is no instruction I think
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what about structuring things
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  there is a couple of things relevant here:
@HeikoS	meta-example dir structure
@HeikoS	the rst-pages should probably mimic that
@HeikoS	so maybe we can prepare that already
@HeikoS	it is just adding two files really to controbute
 lisitsyn	yes makes sense
@HeikoS	and really important to have all tags in place
@HeikoS	like the automatic links to shogun docs
@HeikoS	so that we dont have to touch 100 rst files after we added that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: same goes for links
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we should think what feature we want to put in cookbook
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what feature do you mean?
@HeikoS	e.g. plots?
 lisitsyn	ah ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: do we want that
 lisitsyn	plots are tough..
@HeikoS	or just plain API cookbook
@HeikoS	maybe we can keep the notebooks for that
 lisitsyn	I think it should be simplest possible thing
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	complex stuff goes to notebook
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what about links and shogun doc references
 lisitsyn	it can render tables and plots
 lisitsyn	I should integrate this ctags thing
 lisitsyn	but maybe we can enforce that explicitly
 lisitsyn	with some syntax to mention the class
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: is automatic maybe better?
@HeikoS	but then how to detect it
@HeikoS	so tag might be better
@HeikoS	same with link
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe you can focus on that?
@HeikoS	Ill do some re-structuring
 lisitsyn	yeah I can try to arrange some time for that
 lisitsyn	not sure yet when
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: you could go with creating some structure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah will do
@HeikoS	I will then try to write an example patch,
@HeikoS	will send an example PR
@HeikoS	and then we can use that as documentation how to add things ;)
 lisitsyn	yeap
 lisitsyn	sounds good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: the tags should be easy, no?
 lisitsyn	IIRC they are there
 lisitsyn	or there is some plugin
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and ..... ETA? :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it could be like a week
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: okok
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok I got one more thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: plan the GSoC projects
@HeikoS	so I have in mind:
@HeikoS	installation - s?ren
@HeikoS	plugin - sergey
@HeikoS	shogun detox - lambday, me
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	gp, tensorflow, autodiff - Wu
@HeikoS	the usual suspects - me
@HeikoS	and lambday
@HeikoS	these are base projects
@HeikoS	and then maybe:
@HeikoS	approx kernel stuff -- s?ren (he asked for that)
@HeikoS	but with this, he needs help in installation so depends
@HeikoS	and then fundamental ML2 -- LGSSMs
@HeikoS	not clear who mentors this though
@HeikoS	are you fine with the plugin project mentoring?
 lisitsyn	yes sure
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its a tough project
@HeikoS	needs good planinng
@HeikoS	and a good description
 lisitsyn	I would be happy to help with installation
@HeikoS	so that students feel they get help
@HeikoS	ah also good
@HeikoS	also fine with two projects?
@HeikoS	plugin requires intense mentoring I think
 lisitsyn	it depends
@HeikoS	I also dont want to take too many projects,
 lisitsyn	with a good plan it don't
@HeikoS	last GSoC we ran a bit out of breath
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	yeah also true
 lisitsyn	let me try to come up with a plan
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: see the wiki pages
@HeikoS	they contain a lot already
 lisitsyn	yes there is
 lisitsyn	but let me check if it matches
 lisitsyn	reality
 lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	I put a link to your draft I think
@HeikoS	but yeah have a look....
@HeikoS	maybe we can discuss a schedule a bit?
 lisitsyn	yes once I get through it again
 lisitsyn	somewhen next week?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but keep in mind
@HeikoS	deadline was yesterday
@HeikoS	so Google will check our list this week
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	which means we are judged based on the state it is in then
@HeikoS	that is why I want to do some polishing now
@HeikoS	and get some things going like the cookbook
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I will have some holidays three next days
 lisitsyn	lets see if I manage to push that
@HeikoS	nice
 leagoetz	lisitsyn: HeikoS: I just went through the Wiki for a first polish
 leagoetz	since what Heiko said, Google will look at it this week
 leagoetz	if you notice something Wiki-wise needs attention ->
 leagoetz	write me directly!
 leagoetz	(as can't guarantee I'll hit on it going through whole thing)
@HeikoS	leagoetz: nice, will do :)
