 CaBa	wiking: hi
@wiking	ho
 CaBa	wiking: ROC's are rather short on values after the patch ;)
@wiking	meaning?
 CaBa	wiking: i only get three points or so. no idea how this was before, didn't have a working version
@wiking	lol
@wiking	could you try it before the patch? :)
 CaBa	wiking: ... which is probably why the python example test fails
@wiking	yes
@wiking	i mean it was working before :)
@wiking	(before this patch)
 CaBa	wiking: did the shogun homebrew formula recently get a python dependency when using --with-python?
 CaBa	i don't want homebrew's python...
 CaBa	i need a coffee first...
@wiking	CaBa: u can compile yourself the whole thing :)

 sanuj	shogitter,
@wiking	sanuj ? :)
 sanuj	what is shogitter
 sanuj	shogun gitter bot
 sanuj	?
@wiking	yeah it's a mirror bot between gitter and irc
 sanuj	i see
 shogitter	(vigsterkr) so if people come around here you can react to it
@wiking	;)
 sanuj	awesome :D
@wiking	Saurabh7: ping?
@wiking	sukey: ping
 sukey	PONG
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but yeah i need to work more on sukey
 shogitter	(sanuj) oh i can chat from gitter too
@wiking	yes
 sanuj	it works :D
@wiking	cool :)
@wiking	marvelous
@wiking	what i've realised
@wiking	that our decision tree implementations
@wiking	are hilarious :)
@wiking	we dont support natively categoricals :)
 sanuj	what's sukey?
@wiking	sukey is a hubot
 sanuj	okay
@wiking	https://hubot.github.com/
@wiking	our tree implementations requires already some sorts of encoding
 sanuj	i haven't seen the decision tree implementation
@wiking	of the categoricals :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: nor sklearn does
 lisitsyn	(categoricals)
@wiking	lisitsyn, eh?
 lisitsyn	wiking: well they are still them to dense features
 lisitsyn	or sparse
@wiking	but i mean why not?
@wiking	a tree could easily support a categorical
 lisitsyn	I mean dummy encoding is not that rocket science
 lisitsyn	yeah because we're all dummy
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	but I mean
 lisitsyn	it is not that uncommon to not support these
 lisitsyn	xgboost is tree-based still doesn't work with categorical
 CaBa	wiking: so yeah, before the patch i get plenty of roc values in the example testcase (migrated it to c++) and after the patch there are only threee roc values (which is why the index is out of bounds)
 CaBa	whatever. lets just call it roc-polygon instead of roc-curve and move on?
 CaBa	*duck*
 CaBa	:)

@wiking	?
@wiking	what?
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	wiking: well with only three points it doesn't really look curvy anymore ;-)
 CaBa	more coffee...
@wiking	yeah but i dont understand
@wiking	what you want with a roc with 3 points? )
 CaBa	wiking: i wasn't serious...
@wiking	i guessed
@wiking	:)
 CaBa	probably the one point between (0,0) and (1,1) is even junk ;)
 CaBa	wiking: do you happen to know how to auth in lldb remotely via SSH?
@wiking	mmm good question
 CaBa	wiking: hmmm... i think for the *predicted* ones we need get_value() - the machine probably stores the label confidence in there?!
 CaBa	wiking: ok, at last. figured out what's going on here...
@wiking	CaBa, i thnk you dont need that PR then or?
 CaBa	wiking: i'm not sure
 CaBa	wiking: i'll drop a few lines in a comment
 CaBa	wiking: comment completed.
