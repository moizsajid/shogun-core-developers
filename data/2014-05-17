 abinash_panda	Wow :)
 thoralf	Just run as many single-threaded solvers in parallel.
 thoralf	So easy.  So chear.
 thoralf	cheap
 abinash_panda	Ok. I would try to implement it today :)
 abinash_panda	Regarding the transformation of label-vector and feature-vector to joint-feature-vector.
 abinash_panda	First, I would convert the label vector into sequence of labels. For example for a label of [1, 3] (there are 4 labels in total), I would transform it into [0, 1, 0, 1].
 thoralf	Yeah.
 thoralf	Good choice.
 abinash_panda	And then implement tensor product between these label sequence and feature-vector.
 thoralf	Yes.
 thoralf	But: I think if you implement the independent thing, then you maybe don't need to create the joined vector.
 thoralf	Just a side node.
 thoralf	Maybe you need this method() because the framework requires it; but if you think of independent classifiers, there's no need to explode the vector.
 thoralf	Keep this in mind when implementing... could be a good way to scale it up to thousands of labels.
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 abinash_panda	So, in the first week I would implement CMultilabelModel.
 abinash_panda	Do I need to know something else apart from the implementation of argmax() and get_joint_feature_vector() method.
 thoralf	I don't think so.
 thoralf	Let me check.
 thoralf	loss()
 thoralf	delta_loss()
 abinash_panda	I would be using max loss function.
 abinash_panda	as specified in Lampert CH (2011), Maximum margin multi-label structured prediction
 thoralf	Yeah.
 thoralf	But I think that's all.  joint_features(), argmax(), delta_loss().
 thoralf	Done.
 thoralf	:D
 abinash_panda	Ok. :)
 thoralf	I didn't check the google-doc.  Did you update it or created other documents?
 thoralf	Something I should check?  Or should I wait for new input?
 abinash_panda	Should I start working from today to get an early start.
 thoralf	As you like.
 thoralf	How far did you plan?
 thoralf	I forgot the link, please tell me again.
 abinash_panda	https://docs.google.com/a/itbhu.ac.in/document/d/1PnlKr_VRDS6QOxquZILP5BpPH9FgCtekxOKSz6Rq0l0/edit
 thoralf	Oh, this looks strange on this computer.  Can you unify layout a bit?
 thoralf	bullet points for all weeks, etc.
 abinash_panda	Ok.
 thoralf	And just check all weeks if the are complete and if they are realistic.
 thoralf	For all parts you should know which is already implemented (or prepared) in shogun and what is missing.
 thoralf	(missing: You will implement it. ;))
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	I see your cursor jumping.
