 serialhex_	evening all... how is everyone (whos awake :D )
-!- serialhex_ is now known as serialhex
 serialhex	hmm... i guess everyone is afk or asleep
* serialhex thinks it sucks that when he's awake everyone else is asleep, or vice versa

 blackburn	what I missed? which surprises? ;)
 josip	surprise = someone got into 10 projects ? :))

@sonney2k	blackburn, yes?
 blackburn	sonney2k: :) I think it is not necessary now
 josip	<3
 josip	fuck, wrong window.
-!- ameerkat [~ameerkat@184-98-140-155.phnx.qwest.net] has joined #shogun
 josip	lol.
 blackburn	we heart you too
 blackburn	sonney2k: hm.. but may be you can help me to grasp one thing in ROC
@sonney2k	blackburn, what was the problem (though I am loving it when questions resolve themselves)
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem was my not_understanding how to return matrix in modular, but it is solved now
@sonney2k	blackburn, great!
@sonney2k	so how can I help about ROC?
 blackburn	just looked to typemaps and now understand
-!- akhil__ [75d35896@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.88.150] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	in that algo (do you recall it?) there is if f_prev!=f of i-th example
 blackburn	so if there will be equal answers ROC will be 'shorter'
 josip	blackburn: it has as many points as there are unique thresholds + 1
 josip	in my understanding
 blackburn	josip: yes but why it should?
 blackburn	and the problem for me is how to determine it earlier
 josip	count the number of unique thresholds
@sonney2k	err, it should have the same number of points as you have predictions
 blackburn	some 'overhead' for counting it
 josip	sonney2k: then you'll copies of the same point
 josip	assume all of the points have the same likelihood. Then there is only one fp rate and only one tp rate
@sonney2k	josip, if you used the underestimate/overestimated ROC then yes but for expect ROC curve it is ok
* sonney2k is looking for the roc paper link
 blackburn	sonney2k: so may be I should remove that check?
 josip	blackburn: it depends on how you document it, the graph will look the asme and the integral will be the same
 josip	either way
 blackburn	josip: I see, thank you
 josip	but I'm not the ultimate authority, so I might be mistaken
@sonney2k	josip, page 14 on http://home.comcast.net/~tom.fawcett/public_html/papers/ROC101.pdf
 josip	yes, so the algorithm cramps all of them in one point
 josip	lemme recheck it
@sonney2k	josip, when you have multiple points with the same output then you can get into this problem - so you either have a jump to the right or use the expected curve
@sonney2k	then it is not just one point
@sonney2k	but a diagonal
 blackburn	hehe how silly I am.. it is described in fawcett's paper
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes he is the roc guru (gave tutorials etc on this)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so that check is necessary, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, he also has this nice algorithm (algorithm 2 in that paper)
 josip	but assume that you plot it by varying the threshold and not from the sample which you will do in "production". Then you will classify all points with the same threshold either +1 or -1
@sonney2k	not necessary no
 blackburn	I'm so ashamed with so late acknowledgement with ROC :)
@bettyboo	funny
 josip	blackburn: they're mostly used in medical stuff, because the classes are very disproportionate (i.e. 0.1% chance of having breast cancer)
 josip	s/in/for
@sonney2k	josip, yes when you apply in practise you give a point either +1 or -1
 josip	blackburn: and a classifier that just classifiers everyone as not sick, it will have a 99.9% accuracy on an iid sample from the distribution
 blackburn	josip: I see
@sonney2k	I can only recommend to always use ROC curves when comparing methods
 blackburn	thank you, it became clearer to me
@sonney2k	accuracy etc is a useless measure (if that is not exactly what counts latero on)
 josip	sonney2k: but most people do use only accuracy
@sonney2k	note that ROC curves are still not optimal when you have *really* unbalanced data sets
@sonney2k	then you shoudl use precision recall curves
 blackburn	PRC is my next work :)
@sonney2k	josip, that is bad.
@sonney2k	josip, the user should decide which fp-rate he can afford or how many tp's he needs.
 josip	yup
 josip	I agree
 josip	a single number (+ a CI maybe ..) is just not enough, unless classes are evenly distributed
* serialhex wishes he could matrix-style download some ML textbooks into his head :P
 josip	I got confused for a moment :) You mean The Matrix-style :D
 serialhex	yeah, that too
@sonney2k	blackburn, reading fawcetts description about the algorithm - he indeed suggests to drop points with same output and to draw a connecting line instead
@sonney2k	blackburn, so indeed output can be shorter
* serialhex will bbl, to learn some more...
 blackburn	sonney2k: will count different outputs for that
@sonney2k	blackburn, however I would just allocate an array #outputs
@sonney2k	doesn't matter
@sonney2k	I mean you can allocate a slightly bigger array and then just return the shortened size
 blackburn	hmm.. I can, but is it a good practice..?
@sonney2k	it rarely happens that you have 1e6 outputs that are all the same and so you only have (0,0) and (1,1) in the end
@sonney2k	I don't see a problem... it is wasting memory but that's all (no leaks no other side effects)
 blackburn	okay, just didn't know how you consider it ;)
 blackburn	thank you, sonney2k, josip
 blackburn	have to go now, will test that ROCEvaluation a bit later and will make a pull request
 blackburn	some wasting sounds better for me too, because checking will be another one O(n)
@sonney2k	josip, what I don't know though is how one treats duplicate outputs in PR-Curves
@sonney2k	I only know that each point in ROC space can be translated to a point in PR space
 josip	well the graph will look the same and also the integral
 josip	which is what you care about, right?
@sonney2k	josip, not true unfortunately
@sonney2k	if you don't skip points with same output you run into problems
 josip	that's true, I thought you meant something different
 josip	I gtg, ttyl
-!- sonney2k is now known as shogun|sonney2k
* shogun|sonney2k prepares for the dedup meeting
@shogun|sonney2k	bye josip
@shogun|sonney2k	it is a crazy amount of messages per minute in #gsoc
-!- warpy [~warpy@bzq-79-180-56-86.red.bezeqint.net] has joined #shogun
 warpy	anyone here developed a typemap before ?
@shogun|sonney2k	sure
@shogun|sonney2k	627 people in #gsoc - just crazy
 warpy	oh hey there, didnt see you
 warpy	long nick name
@shogun|sonney2k	great isn't it
@shogun|sonney2k	required in the dedup thing going on in #gsoc
 warpy	shogun|sonney2k, someone i work with is trying to figure out how to do a c# port
 warpy	i told him i'd ask a few questions, many things are still very much a blur to us
@shogun|sonney2k	ask ... but don't expect me to answer immediately - I have to check if we get any dupes due to the reshuffling going on in #gsoc
 warpy	would you mind explaining the core difference between the static and dynamic interfaces
@shogun|sonney2k	warpy, one is swig based and each C++ object will become an object in $LANGUAGE
@shogun|sonney2k	static is just some global variables with a few objects assigned.
 warpy	a c++ object is (a function, a class?)?
@shogun|sonney2k	class
@shogun|sonney2k	+ associated functions
 warpy	and $LANGUAGE is ?
@shogun|sonney2k	what you want C# or python or...
 warpy	so basically every c++ object will become another object in the designated language
@shogun|sonney2k	yes
 warpy	does it mean that we have to create the code of the $language's object that deals with the c++ object?
 warpy	for each and every one ?
@shogun|sonney2k	no
@shogun|sonney2k	swig does that for you
 warpy	can you explain a little on how, i am guessing it doesnt convert c++ to c#
@shogun|sonney2k	warpy, no I cannot - check the swig homepage...
-!- shogun|sonney2k is now known as sonney2k
@sonney2k	dedup meeting is over
@sonney2k	hurray
 warpy	regarding static interfaces. how do they work in concept. so you have global variables and a few classes. do you need a wrapper class to interface with a c++ class ?
 warpy	maybe we should take some class as an example
@sonney2k	warpy, we have set/get* interface functions for all kinds of things (scalars, vectors, matrices,...)
@sonney2k	and each $lang has to implement these
 warpy	okay so both interface types static and dynamic need to create new classes to deal with all the input types ?
@sonney2k	global variables are then for e.g. classifiers - so one can only have one classifier
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	in static interfaces you need these set/get functions (that we have defined in our SGInterface)
@sonney2k	in the modular ones you write typemaps
 warpy	so in the static one you would write your set get functions in the designated language, this is actually a wrapper for the c++ functions, correct ?
@sonney2k	warpy, no you write them in C++
@sonney2k	and utilize you native interface (e.g. in java JNI, in python c extensions etc)
-!- akhil__ [75d35896@gateway/web/freenode/ip.117.211.88.150] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 warpy	so the static interface is always written in c++ but uses libraries from the designated language  ?
@sonney2k	warpy, yes - but the typemaps are also C or C++ and utilize the libraries
@sonney2k	so in that respect it is similar though modular is more powerful as you really have access to all C++ objects in your $lang
 warpy	okay so the main difference between static and dynamic is that static is limited to functions and classes that you yourself predefined and dynamic by using swig has access to everything
@sonney2k	warpy, yes
 warpy	awesome, regarding the type map itself. the whole development process.
 warpy	basically what i would need is to load the project in a c++ ide and first be able to compile it
 warpy	so far so good ?
@sonney2k	yes
 warpy	is it possible to use vc++, or any windows based ide ?
@sonney2k	I've only ever compiled it onder posix platforms  + cygwin
@sonney2k	warpy, I suspect that will not work out of the box
@sonney2k	we use posix threads and signals for example
 warpy	sorry, posix ?
@sonney2k	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX
 warpy	cygwin i have used before
 warpy	okay so that the only way you have for windows so far
 warpy	so lets say it compiles under windows using cygwin etc
 warpy	i believe you have a tutorial on your site for windows compiling, correct ?
@sonney2k	warpy, just get all the dependencies... and compile
 warpy	alright
 warpy	if you remember, you prepared shogun to support c#. how does a typemap point to that. is it somekind of directive inside the code ?
@sonney2k	warpy, you need to write the file csharp/swig_typemaps.i
@sonney2k	warpy, sploving is the expert to ask here - he actually contributed to swig
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you had some activity with what dedup?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no dupes...
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	sonney2k: forgot one awful thing.. I have to know size of matrix because it is 2d
@sonney2k	blackburn, argh... you are right
 blackburn	seems I have to count num of different labels
 warpy	okay so lets imagine we wrote the typemap and recompiled shogun and everything works
 warpy	now for the interesting part
 warpy	how do i use it with in c# (vc# for example)
 warpy	is it a matter of doing "using shogun;"
 warpy	sonney2k, still there?
@sonney2k	warpy, yes - no idea. never used csharp berfore
 blackburn	such irritated with not having much time for finish issues with evaluation!
 warpy	what it would be like in other languages ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how do you use valgrind when running tests?
 blackburn	I mean when I ran it, there are many 'pythonic' errors, and I don't see any useful information
@sonney2k	warpy, you really should look at the examples http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/examples.html
@sonney2k	warpy, it is intuitive to say the least
@sonney2k	blackburn, you either use a reasonable suppressions file or you dump everything into a file and grep for shogun
@sonney2k	(later on)
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	thank you
 blackburn	*getting mad cause some memory allocation error*
 blackburn	rghhh
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	I'm such a fool :D
 warpy	okay looking thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: we both failed! I'm _not_ have to know the size of matrix if I will return first N columns..
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh you are right it is column first so UI#H@OI#UH@!!!!
* sonney2k 's brain is off
 blackburn	:D was?
 blackburn	sonney2k: you better kick me off cause I'm stupid :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yesterday (for you today) was the day shogun's github received no commits
@sonney2k	blackburn, hurray :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it? ;) do you like when we arent commiting?
 blackburn	oh, I finally find the error
@sonney2k	blackburn, well we had a screw up commit on that day and I had to force push ... so better no push/pull than such ones!
 blackburn	hahhaha
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the commit?
@sonney2k	you won't see it :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what it screwed?
@sonney2k	and I am too ashamed to disclose what we did :)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	I already had a proper ROC, but now it returned:
 blackburn	http://img823.imageshack.us/i/hehee.png/
 blackburn	sonney2k: seems to be a strange ROC :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, modern art
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, at least it is between 0 and 1
 blackburn	hehe, I screwed something when doing some 'refactoring'
 serialhex	blackburn: wtf is that image _supposed_ to be??? :P
 blackburn	serialhex: ROC curve :)
 blackburn	serialhex: may be like http://publications.csail.mit.edu/abstracts/abstracts07/patrycja/roc4.jpg
 serialhex	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic is this what your talking about???
 blackburn	yeap
 serialhex	ahh, ok cool
* serialhex goes and reads about roc's, and not this kind: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_(mythology)
@sonney2k	serialhex, cool bird :D
 serialhex	yes i know
 blackburn	someone is stealing my ROC
* serialhex has played too much D&D
 blackburn	serialhex: is it you?
 serialhex	i'm not stealing it :D
 blackburn	serialhex: I'm watching!
 serialhex	i'm sure you are
 blackburn	it draws some fantastic things :D
 serialhex	really? such as???
* serialhex waits to see some fantastic drawings
 blackburn	serialhex: http://img64.imageshack.us/f/hehek.png/
 blackburn	the only thing i'm pretty sure: it isn't ROC, it is some memory 'slice' :D
 serialhex	yeah... you can start a new form of art with it: abstract graph art :D
* serialhex loves wikipedia
* sonney2k yawns
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw wikipedia lists the other measures we have on the ROC page too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic
 dvevre	sonney2k: are the irc logs online somewhere?
@sonney2k	dvevre, not yet
@sonney2k	didn't find the time...
 dvevre	hmm.. okay..
 serialhex	dvevre: if i can figure out how to extract them from quassel i have a pretty complete log of the chat
* serialhex has logs since ~4 days after the channel opened
 dvevre	serialhex: you never disconnect? nice!
 serialhex	dvevre: yeah i almost never turn my computer off
@bettyboo	nite
 dvevre	serialhex: i'm mostly stuck with the webchat version here.. and that too on a lab computer
 serialhex	:-/ that kind of sucks dvevre!
 dvevre	hence have to miss out on much of the conversation..
 blackburn	sonney2k: eh.. they all are already implemented
 blackburn	except MCC
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think that one too - we just named it cross_correlation_coefficient or so
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	right
@sonney2k	I just meant to say - nice table :)
