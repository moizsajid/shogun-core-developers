 BrianC_	Hi
 BrianC_	Is 'src/shogun/kernel/Kernel.cpp : fix multithreading error w/ svr light - http://git.io/VVXcFA' a working fix?  I reran  regression_svrlight_modular.py with 10 threads and it still seems to be producing the 'success' warning
 BrianC_	(followed by a seg fault)

 Guest96150	blackburn, windows did it btw  - it destroyed my linux partition on the other harddrive
 blackburn	Guest96150: fantastisch
 Guest96150	and I was already wondering why I could install w7 at all
 Guest96150	superior technology
 Guest96150	so it will probably take me a few days before I am operational again
 blackburn	why you did install it?!
 Guest96150	wanted to get shogun running under cygwin
 blackburn	ah
 Guest96150	but hey - internet broke here today, our build machine crashed after > 1month of uptime with some kernel panik
 Guest96150	so yeah baby ...
 blackburn	BrianC_: sad news
 BrianC_	?
 blackburn	BrianC_: that our fix is not a fix :)
 BrianC_	ah
 BrianC_	btw Guest96150, you can restore the linux partition via grub on a live CD
 BrianC_	it just wipes the MBR, not the actual partition
 blackburn	agree
 Guest96150	unfortunately not
 Guest96150	it installed some few MB of boot loader crap
 blackburn	ooooh
 Guest96150	onto my linux partition
 Guest96150	so it is mostly gone
 BrianC_	o
 blackburn	rip
 blackburn	:D
 BrianC_	always best to sandbox windows in a virt, only exception is if you need drivers for games or something
 blackburn	BrianC_: all ok with regression_svrlight on my machine..
 BrianC_	odd
 BrianC_	hmm i manually incerted the fix into kernel.cpp
 BrianC_	and recompiled
 blackburn	why manually?
 BrianC_	version on git doesnt build correctly for me
 blackburn	what is the error?
 BrianC_	undefied method: StreamingSparseFeatures.get_feature apparently
 blackburn	?!
 blackburn	how it can be..
 BrianC_	not sure actually i did see the code for that method in StreamingSparseFeatures.cpp
 BrianC_	and modshogun.py has it defined as well
 BrianC_	well it cant find it in _modshogun.so
 BrianC_	build should have returned a link error, no?
 blackburn	that's really odd
 blackburn	Guest96150: any ideas?
 BrianC_	  File "/home/mike/brian/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/modshogun.py", line 26, in swig_import_helper     _mod = imp.load_module('_modshogun', fp, pathname, description) ImportError: /home/mike/brian/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/_modshogun.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun24CStreamingSparseFeaturesIiE11get_featureEi
 BrianC_	is the exact error if that helps
 blackburn	BrianC_: have you tried to 'git clean -dfx' and reconfig/rebuild?
 BrianC_	ive tried 'make clean' since I don't have git installed ont hat machine
 blackburn	try make distclean
 blackburn	it could be some junk left from wrong compilation or so
 BrianC_	k ill try that now and recomp
 BrianC_	ah, sysadmin rebooting!
 BrianC_	....20 second warning time
 blackburn	cruel
 blackburn	:D
