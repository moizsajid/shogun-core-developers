 serialhex	sonney2k, are you on?
 serialhex	hmm, ok, well when you get on there are 2 things:
 serialhex	1) Kernel needs to be renamed, as it's a top-level module in ruby (everything decends from object, and object mixes in kernel, so every object will add those methods & stuff to it when you require kernel)
 serialhex	it could be something as simple as Kernels, seeing as theres more than one...
 serialhex	2) how does one make the *.so files that are generated be lowercase, as rubyists expect to "require 'classifier'"  not "require 'Classifier'"  and with Classifier.so being capitalized the first wont find it
 serialhex	i noticed this can be done while looking at the java_modular stuff, i just dont know where it is (or if that's the default of how it outputs)

 blackburn	hehe just noticed mds has been accepted as is
 serialhex	cool cool
 serialhex	you doin alright blackburn?
 blackburn	serialhex: yeap, all day long was doing lecture notes for exam on parallel computations
 serialhex	cool, sounds like fun :P
 blackburn	I fckng hate teacher of that shit
 blackburn	and how are you today?
 serialhex	doing well, writing up some tests for the ruby modular stuff
 serialhex	basically making sure the libs load up properly & stuff
 blackburn	I have just read logs
 blackburn	you said there are kernel conflict :)
 blackburn	it is really strange they called some base object - kernel
 serialhex	yeah, it's not really an object, it's all the basic methods that are used throughout most of the objects
 serialhex	though object Object has it's own methods too :D
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	anyway strange naming
 blackburn	why not Base or sth like that
 serialhex	(yes, it is fun to talk about the object Object and how class Class's superclass is module or sth... :P )
 serialhex	idk, but that's what it is...
 serialhex	if we can rename it kernels then we're good, but i dunno if he'll want to name it that or sth else
 blackburn	hmm it is raining all day long
 serialhex	nice!  i wish it would rain here
 serialhex	SWEET!!! my test failed :D
 blackburn	may be it is possible to rename it in typemap?
 blackburn	serialhex: hmm if question starts with maybe is it ok to say 'it is' and not 'is it'?
 blackburn	voices in my head says it is ok but idk
 blackburn	:D
 serialhex	yeah, you're right
 serialhex	on both counts :D
 serialhex	i'm also hoping to find a way to rename all the files from "Foo.so" to "foo.so"
 blackburn	Foo.i should contain sth related to
 serialhex	hmm... i'll look there in a min...

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh your patch is suspicous ...
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	looks like you didn't do a git pull --rebase
 blackburn	I didn't
@sonney2k	so this means git took what you did as the master and applied everything I and others did on top of your stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: where is the difference?
 blackburn	sonney2k: but the diff is only for 4 files
@sonney2k	blackburn, one is using what I do as a master and apply your patch on top
 blackburn	ah so everything is ok now?
@sonney2k	and one is to use what you did and apply all the many patches on top
@sonney2k	and you should do the first by using git pull --rebase
 blackburn	sorry, I haven't knew it
@sonney2k	yeah too late now
@sonney2k	next time
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah it makes my branch 'branched' from the current master, right?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	you should rebase
@sonney2k	either you do git checkout master
@sonney2k	then git pull
@sonney2k	and then git checkout <nameofyourbranch>
@sonney2k	git rebase master
 blackburn	sonney2k: so if I want to keep my branch actual I should not git merge upstream/master but git rebase?
@sonney2k	yes of course !
 blackburn	damn
 blackburn	i'm useless hehe
@bettyboo	:*)
@sonney2k	I mean we could still undo the last change
@sonney2k	I just do some git reset --hard
@sonney2k	and then git push --force
@sonney2k	but no idea if someone else already git pull'd
@sonney2k	then it would go kaboom
* blackburn is crying :)

 serialhex	wow, it's been a LOOONG time since i've used windows... and i dont miss it!
 blackburn	sonney2k: but git pull is pulling only my local master
 blackburn	how to apply upstream master?
 serialhex	git pull upstream master
 serialhex	(if you've made an upstream)
 blackburn	oh damn
 serialhex	???
 blackburn	actually I was doing merging with upstream all the time
 blackburn	I just didn't know there is a human way to do it
 serialhex	HA!!!  thats wonky!!! :P
@bettyboo	*g*
 serialhex	wow windows is being slow!!!
 blackburn	sonney2k: well so what you will do?
 blackburn	serialhex: I'm a stupid monkey - I have pulled a request with all changes being before :D
 blackburn	because I had been doing merging all the time
@sonney2k	I suspect otherers will or have already made the same mistake and I just didn't notice because I cannot recognize this from the diff
@sonney2k	serialhex, I have no idea what we should do about kernel
@sonney2k	I mean adding an exception just for ruby will be confusing on the long run
@sonney2k	so we should have a consistent name
 serialhex	true... and breaking backwards compatibility is probably bad...
@sonney2k	the problem is that I was just about to de-pluralize things
@sonney2k	like distributions
 serialhex	ok
@sonney2k	-> distribution
* blackburn just found out that git have 'stash' cmd
@sonney2k	we are currently massively breaking things
 serialhex	HAHA!!! lol
@sonney2k	I mean recall the CClassifier -> CMachine change
@sonney2k	preproc -> preprocessors
@sonney2k	etc etc
 serialhex	true
 blackburn	next version of shogun will be surprising a lot
@sonney2k	after this GSoC we hopefully have sth stabalized
@sonney2k	stabelized
 blackburn	just imagine some guy using shogun from his ubuntu repo
 blackburn	and one day it is all changed :D
@bettyboo	smart
 serialhex	ZOMG WINDOWS IS SOOOO FSCKING SLOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!
 serialhex	blackburn, theres a free uber-git book @ http://progit.org/
 blackburn	ehh
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	serialhex: do you know how to completely replace my master to upstream master?
 blackburn	with*
 serialhex	wow, you sound like i told you that if you had sex with an ugly woman i'd give you $100
 serialhex	umm... hd on
 blackburn	no, ehh is about my issues with my master branch
 blackburn	I have commited something I should not
 serialhex	well you could do a git reset --hard HEAD^ if it was your last commit
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	it is ok now
 blackburn	I pushed --force it
 serialhex	you fixed it?
 blackburn	yeap
 serialhex	ahh... yeah that'll fix your github.com stuffz
 serialhex	FFS!!! i'm like 3 days late for the sale!!! dammit!
 serialhex	and i *REALLY* hate this font!!
 blackburn	for some reason I want to reinstall my ubuntu hehe
 blackburn	well why not
 blackburn	it was a mistake to update it
 serialhex	update what??
 blackburn	10.10 -> 11.04
 serialhex	oh, yeah, that's the reason why i moved to archlinux
 blackburn	arch? how it is?
 serialhex	i *LOVE* gentoo, but i dont have the time to install it
 blackburn	I was thinking about debian
 blackburn	i'm a paranoid sometimes and now when X.org falls down sometimes I'm even a bigger paranoid
 blackburn	well I think now I'll install ubuntu 11.04 and will remove unity :)
 serialhex	heh, yeah unity sucks afaik
 blackburn	when I had updated ubuntu I deleted unity in 1 min :D
* blackburn is saving cracked wolfram mathematica license
 serialhex	you think you might be able to get me in on the mathematica action?? :D
 blackburn	don't understand
 serialhex	cracked mathematica license + e-mail to me = a new toy!!
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I don't know if it will be working for you (there is a hardware key afaik)
 serialhex	yeah, i've never used mathematica... i heard it's pretty spiffy
 serialhex	ooh, thats not cool!
 blackburn	I can send you a crack anyway if you want :D
 blackburn	I just don't care if it bad
 serialhex	ok
 serialhex	OOH!!! i need a new computer!!!
 serialhex	i'll bbl!

@sonney2k	hmmhh
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r07b707b / (4 files in 3 dirs):
 CIA-18	shogun: Potentially work around the java_modular compile error.
 CIA-18	shogun: This commit *may* again cause issues with labels not being known in classifiers or
 CIA-18	shogun: kernels respectively in preprocs. - http://bit.ly/jsVLVK

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you use debian on your laptop?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am a debian developer...
@sonney2k	of course
@sonney2k	but I might have different focus
@sonney2k	I don't need the newest stuff just a stable system
@sonney2k	and I don't want to upgrade too often
@sonney2k	I just don't have time for this
@sonney2k	and ubuntu is just too unstable for me
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it very stable?
@sonney2k	and really has a lot of buggy software - since it uses random snapshot of debian packages for the release
 blackburn	may be I will change it to debian some day too :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, depends of course but I use it on 3 servers / all machines at work and on my notebooks.
 blackburn	I don't like unity and all these stuff
@sonney2k	no issues so far
