 chintak	hey anyone around?
 chintak	while trying to install shogun on OSX yosemite, I'm getting the following error - GPUMatrix.h:47:2: error: too many template parameters in template redeclaration
 chintak	The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:   * CCache  * GDB  * BLAS  * LAPACK  * GLPK  * Eigen3 (required version >= 3.1.2)  * ViennaCL (required version >= 1.5.0)  * OpenCV  * NLopt  * LpSolve  * ColPack  * Doxygen  * LibXml2  * HDF5  * CURL  * ZLIB  * BZip2  * LibLZMA  * SNAPPY  * LZO  * Spinlock  * Threads  * Protobuf
 chintak	pls help me out
 sonne|work	lambday: GPUMatrix.h  line 47? that's you?
 sonne|work	chintak: which viennacl version do you have?
 chintak	yes
 chintak	i have the latest one
 chintak	downloaded from their site and compiled
 sonne|work	IIRC they changed the matrix layout internally
 sonne|work	chintak: so uninstall viennacl until we fixed this
 chintak	ok
 chintak	http://sourceforge.net/projects/viennacl/ version 1.6.2
 sonne|work	chintak: yeah 1.6 won't work
 chintak	should i try and install 1.5 ?
 sonne|work	chintak: well shogun will work without but if you want viennacl then yes
 chintak	better off without it then
 chintak	thanks for hte help!
@lisitsyn	yes yes that's the reason
@lisitsyn	thanks sonne|work
@lisitsyn	chintak: you won't get much from viennacl yet anyway
 chintak	cool, installing without it :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: is the plan to use viennacl for GPU based NNs?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes
@lisitsyn	some kernels like convolution are already here
@lisitsyn	and rlu and sigm
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: and I guess you have blas /lapack / etc fallbacks right?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: mainly for (int i=0; fallbacks
@lisitsyn	some ops are quite specific
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: but yeah I don't want it to be removed
@lisitsyn	I still don't have gpu but playing with NNs is interesting sometimes

 chintak	sonne|work: are you there? while building modular python bindings, i get the following error - python_modular/modshogunPYTHON_wrap.cxx:8419:23: error: use of undeclared identifier '_seq'
 sonne|work	chintak: let me guess swig 3.0.3 ?
 chintak	3.0.4
 chintak	:)
 sonne|work	chintak: or that yes
 chintak	won't work?
 sonne|work	you need 3.0.5 now - they introduced a bug in some 3.0.X release that causes this issue
 chintak	so build from source, cool np

@lisitsyn	lambday: yeah sure I can co-mentor
@lambday	lisitsyn: great!
@lambday	lisitsyn: what's your plans for REST? :P
@lisitsyn	lambday: world domination
@lambday	lisitsyn: how would it work?
@lambday	lisitsyn: I mean, the data
@lisitsyn	lambday: but wiking's idea on mesos is also very very cool
@lambday	lisitsyn: works on docker?
@lisitsyn	lambday: no mesos is a way to go distributed
@lisitsyn	lambday: as for rest
@lisitsyn	well
@lisitsyn	remember some guys had some specification?
@lisitsyn	I should read it more but I think they had an idea
@lambday	what guys? shogun guys?
@lisitsyn	lambday: no, that guy from australia hmmm
@lisitsyn	mark reid!
@lambday	lol you lost me
@lisitsyn	hah
@lisitsyn	let me find that mail
@lambday	ah found it
-!- curiousguy13 [~curiousgu@122.162.89.78] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
@lisitsyn	lambday: ok then
@lisitsyn	so you see there is a spec
@lambday	MLAAS :/
@lisitsyn	lambday: well we can get support on that
@lisitsyn	:D
@lambday	lisitsyn: just from a quick glance - they already wrote some wrapper for scikit learn and they wanted to write one for shogun as well
@lambday	so yeah
@lisitsyn	lambday: we can improve that
@lisitsyn	anyway much easier to start with that
@lisitsyn	lambday: aaS is good
@lisitsyn	not just showcase but say in some companies like I am working in
@lisitsyn	I'd setup some rest to do some experiments I think
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah that's true
@lisitsyn	much easier
@lambday	lisitsyn: I'm working on REST here as well
 sonne|work	lambday & lisitsyn +1
 sonne|work	we wanted that in for last year's gsoc
@lisitsyn	lets just do it
 sonne|work	but didn't find a student for that
@lisitsyn	docker + mesos + rest
@lisitsyn	hah
@lisitsyn	that's like when you install shogun in one second
@lisitsyn	and you have distributed core with rest interface
@lambday	sonne|work: lisitsyn: I'm wondering how would it work - say we have data - we specify classification method, params and their values in http req param and get json/xml result
@lambday	how to send the data via http? which format?
@lisitsyn	a few possible formats I think
@lisitsyn	binary + sth like svmlight
@lambday	lisitsyn: what about binary data?
@lambday	hmm
@lisitsyn	I think it would be necessary to support storages
@lisitsyn	like S3 or whatever
@lisitsyn	so I just say
@lisitsyn	train on s3://mydataset
@lisitsyn	not just push all the data through http
@lisitsyn	as its inefficient
@lambday	ok gotcha provide the uri
 sonne|work	yeah or file://
@lisitsyn	yeah anything
@lambday	yep
@lisitsyn	file/http/s3/whatever
@lisitsyn	hdfs
@lisitsyn	hdfs is important
@lisitsyn	so you just say train on that thing
@lisitsyn	with all the details
@lisitsyn	lambday: what's very important is to have very compact core
@lisitsyn	that can apply your trained model
@lambday	lisitsyn: what do you mean by compact core?
@lisitsyn	not 100mb .so
@lisitsyn	but very very small thing
@lambday	lisitsyn: yeah
@lisitsyn	it has to be crazy fast
@lambday	lisitsyn: so it goes back to plugin thingi
@lambday	lisitsyn: without plugin framework it would be impossible to manage the size of shogun
@lisitsyn	so that one can really rely on shogun in production env
@lisitsyn	yeah but that's other thing
@lambday	lisitsyn: so about rest, we specify the data - where does the processing occurs?
@lambday	occur*
@lisitsyn	lambday: what kind of processing?
@lambday	lisitsyn: train/test - user's local system or some shogun server?
@lisitsyn	lambday: to be discussed I guess
@lisitsyn	some basic preproc can be done by shogun
@lisitsyn	but not much of it
@lambday	lisitsyn: okay
@lambday	sounds great :D let's do this
@lisitsyn	phew oil prices raise
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	+1
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: my salary vanished with these prices :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: maybe the evil strategist behind this is running out of money?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes and russia already ran out of money
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	the proxy war stuff is really running well! europe is suffering too :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I doubt that's serious, ain't it marginal?
@lisitsyn	we have inflation like 30% I think
 sonne|work	yeah compared to that it is marginal
@lambday	sonne|work: shall we add shogun's name in the ML section here http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/links/libs ? :D
 sonne|work	feel free!
@lisitsyn	we really need to get rid of pointers
@lisitsyn	I write modern C++ and there are no pointers, really cumbersome to use shogun
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: do it :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: waiting to be merged
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: what would it do?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: Some<CClassifier> classifier = some<CSVM>();
@lisitsyn	I believe it is very linguistic
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: so classifier is refcounted internally then or what?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: just another name for shared_ptr
@lisitsyn	so yes
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: but now it just SG_REF/UNREF it
@lisitsyn	on copy and delete
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I see - so the biggest issue is then to convert all the code to use that right?
@lisitsyn	yeah
 sonne|work	(a nightmare so to say)
@lisitsyn	well
@lisitsyn	not really that hard
 sonne|work	but certainly possible withing one GSOC
@lisitsyn	just remove all sg_ref and sg_unref and convert [a-b]*\* to Some<..>
 sonne|work	*food
@lisitsyn	should instantly work
@lisitsyn	or not
 chintak	sonne|work: i tried installing modular python interface with SWIG 3.05 but same error - _seq undeclared identifier
 chintak	the C++ code is nicely compiled
 chintak	*SWIG 3.0.5
@lambday	sonne|work: done! :D
@lambday	lisitsyn: shall we use a c++ sdk for rest?
@lambday	lisitsyn: or java/jersey-jackson
@lisitsyn	lambday: no idea
@lisitsyn	should not matter a lot actually
@lisitsyn	but I'd avoid java :D
@lisitsyn	for religious reasons
@lambday	lisitsyn: me too :D https://bitbucket.org/Corvusoft/restbed/wiki/Home
@lisitsyn	lambday: beta ;)
@lambday	lisitsyn: microsoft has one
@lambday	(!)
@lambday	but that doesn't support xml
@lisitsyn	we don't need xml I think
@lisitsyn	chintak: is there a chance wrong swig is used?
@lisitsyn	like if you have a few of them installed
 chintak	i removed the earlier version
 chintak	had brew installed it earlier
 chintak	just 3.0.5 now

 chintak	which swig version had you built it with last?
 chintak	lisitsyn
@lisitsyn	I don't remember whether I built it on mac recently
@lisitsyn	with swig
 chintak	ok
@lisitsyn	should be possible to fix
@lisitsyn	let me check
 chintak	cool
@lisitsyn	chintak: I think I know what's going on
@lisitsyn	it is clang issue
@lisitsyn	probably
 chintak	is it about the default std lib changing from libc++ to stdlibc++ ?
@lisitsyn	chintak: looks like apple's compiler is not really good at compiling static member functions
@lisitsyn	chintak: I am now trying to fix the source code of generated wrapper
@lisitsyn	once done you could do the same and get it working
 chintak	lisitsyn: I'm trying to compile using gcc-4.9/g++-4.9 instead of the default clang
@lisitsyn	chintak: good idea just to try
-!- Rahul21 [~Rahul@117.196.81.23] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	chintak: hah that's really cryptic what swig generates nowadays
 chintak	no problems
 chintak	60% done
 chintak	hopefully this goes through, else I'll stick to C++ only
 chintak	for some reason this compilation is way slower, in spite of using the usual -j8
@lisitsyn	chintak: gcc is slower
@lisitsyn	chintak: much more complex inside
 chintak	hmm
 chintak	lisitsyn: nope, it breaks at 84%
 chintak	Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ranlib: file: libshogun.a(PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp.o) has no symbol

 chintak	google::protobuf
@lisitsyn	chintak: I think I am quite close to solve this thing
@lisitsyn	chintak: it caused by 'check' word
 chintak	lisitsyn: how are you doing it?
@lisitsyn	they named a few functions 'check'
@lisitsyn	it conflicts with something
@lisitsyn	well I just edit the generated .cxx and try things
 chintak	cool
@lisitsyn	yeah I did that
@lisitsyn	chintak: it takes like 6-7 replaces
 chintak	awesome!
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: what happened?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: gonna patch swig now
@lisitsyn	:D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: I am tempted to let some version of shogun to always compile against latest swig
 chintak	sonne|work: error with the latest swig
* sonne|work sighs
 sonne|work	chintak: I meant so we can find swig bugs before they release
 chintak	oops my bad
@lisitsyn	chintak: ok the workflow is
@lisitsyn	you make
@lisitsyn	and get some error right near to the 'check' function
@lisitsyn	rename it to check_
 chintak	I get errors regarding undeclared identifier _seq
 chintak	lisitsyn
@lisitsyn	chintak: yeah
@lisitsyn	find the error about 'check'
@lisitsyn	this would solve it
 chintak	lisitsyn: i dont seem to get any error mentioning `check`
@lisitsyn	chintak: could you please paste errors somewhere?
 chintak	http://pastebin.com/y90dEECZ
@lisitsyn	1.error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
@lisitsyn	2.    static bool {
@lisitsyn	uhmm tihs error is quite strange
 chintak	yes
@lisitsyn	how did that happen to have static bool {
 chintak	static bool check(PyObject *obj) {
 chintak	should i replace this to `check_`?
 chintak	the line corresponding to one of the "error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers "
@lisitsyn	static bool check_(PyObject* obj) {
@lisitsyn	chintak: any help needed?
 chintak	4 matches?
@lisitsyn	chintak: yeah probably
@lisitsyn	and two calls iirc
 chintak	im sorry, iirc?
 chintak	bool check(bool set_err = true) const?
@lisitsyn	chintak: yes this thing as well
@lisitsyn	chintak: I am now going to commit these changes
 chintak	yep fixed
 chintak	:D
@lisitsyn	and do a pull request
 chintak	yes
@lisitsyn	for swig
@lisitsyn	but for now we can use patched swig from my branch

@lisitsyn	if you compile swig from that branch
@lisitsyn	you should get it working
 chintak	it makes correctly, but I get a seg fault on running `from modshogun import Classifier`
@lisitsyn	oh
@lisitsyn	hmm
 chintak	cool, ill try it out
 sonne|work	chintak: make sure you use the same python version you compiled with
 sonne|work	chintak: not that you have 2 different ones installed - you might get mixups and crashes
@lisitsyn	I didn't check to be honest
 chintak	just 1 version
@lisitsyn	let me check
 chintak	np
 sonne|work	chintak: not one from e.g. brew and one system python?
 chintak	brew installed one
 sonne|work	chintak: so there you have it
 sonne|work	so you have 2 different ones
 sonne|work	one in /usr/local/bin/python
 sonne|work	and one on /usr/bin
 chintak	yes
 sonne|work	chintak: well try to do the import modshogun
