 wiking	ok
 wiking	so it seems i can rebase now
 wiking	so what do i use instead of sg_realloc?
@sonney2k	SG_REALLOC /SG_MALLOC / SG_CALLOC everything as usual
 wiking	structure/CCSOSVM.cpp:294:7: error: use of undeclared identifier 'SG_REALLOC'
 wiking	after rebase
 wiking	structure/CCSOSVM.cpp:298:50: error: too few arguments provided to function-like macro invocation
 blackburn	wiking: it was working before?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	it was
 blackburn	baad
 wiking	before rebase to the memory magix
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	so what the fuck
 blackburn	can yuo show these 294 and 298?
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/823/files#L0R307
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/823/files#L0R311
 blackburn	wiking: you should provide old size
 wiking	LOLFACE?!
 blackburn	type,pointer,old_len,len
 wiking	comooone?!
 wiking	why?
 wiking	have any of you seen man realloc ? :D
 wiking	i mean sorry but why would u need the oldsize?
 blackburn	because there is not realloc for new/delete
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	wiking, that is new[
@sonney2k	]
@sonney2k	delete[]
@sonney2k	and copy
 wiking	well realloc shouldnt behave like that
@sonney2k	and no way to figure out how much to copy underneath
@sonney2k	wiking, there is no realloc for new[]
 blackburn	it is not realloc in case of sgvectors
 wiking	my 2 cents
@sonney2k	so that is why we need that
 wiking	fuck me in da face
 wiking	i mean if we want memory managment
 blackburn	see better solution?
 wiking	why u just don't take the fucking memory pool from kernel.org
 wiking	even better
 blackburn	how does it solve your problem?
 wiking	it was stupid of me to rebase
 blackburn	you don't know old size?
 wiking	well
 blackburn	wiking: put 0 here if you don't know
 wiking	yeah i have to maintain
 blackburn	it is not referenced anyway
 wiking	a new variable
 wiking	that like fucking tracks
 wiking	each fucking REALLOC's
 wiking	state
 wiking	fuckthishit
 blackburn	can't say adding zero is so much issue
 wiking	no but if i want to use it right
 wiking	that's what i should do
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	it is used only if you realloc array of vectors
 wiking	http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/pool/doc/index.html
 blackburn	wiking: so?
 wiking	i have 1000+ line of patch here
 wiking	and now trying to merge
 blackburn	so you want to change everything to use pool with one more 1000+ line patch? :D
 wiking	no i have some other patch
 wiking	and now i've rebased
 wiking	and now i'm broken
 wiking	so i have to merge now
 wiking	so that i can do anything
 wiking	like continue working
 wiking	libbm* shit has been minorly refactored
 wiking	but i have a feeling that that code should be rewriten in c++
 blackburn	which code?
 wiking	libbm*
 wiking	oh yeah
 wiking	code is breaking
 blackburn	well I agree it could be better to write in C++ everywhere
 wiking	well there's so much code redundancy in that one
 blackburn	but that's legacy - do you want to write and test it once again
 wiking	well i've clean it up
 wiking	as much as i can
 blackburn	does it make use of vector operations?
 wiking	got like /2 speedup
 blackburn	because of eigen used?
 wiking	so it's like 2* faster...
 blackburn	for dot
 wiking	well eigen and cblas
 wiking	within each iteration it does at least 5 dots
 blackburn	we should think about alignment actually
 wiking	and another 3 of vec1_plus_alpha_vec2 stuff...
 wiking	but then again
 blackburn	feature vectors should be aligned
 wiking	sgvector.h has to be refactored
 wiking	i fucking hate to call static functions for a dot product
 wiking	well alignement
 wiking	is os/arch dependent
 blackburn	no
 wiking	so some cases u are lucky
 wiking	that the mem is alloced
 blackburn	in case of 3d vectors
 blackburn	we are always unlucky
 blackburn	I mean for eigen
 blackburn	I don't care about cblas as it as old as sonney2k :D
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	I didn't suggest that guy eigen3
 blackburn	to not speed up nuclear weapons development
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	oh I should stop joking about that
 blackburn	wiking: where have you seen that distCum?
 wiking	ahahahah
 wiking	of course a matlab code
 wiking	academics ;)
 blackburn	what does it mean?
 blackburn	distance okay
 blackburn	but what cum stands for in code?
 wiking	cumulative distance
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	lol
 blackburn	wiking: I received math_anal.zip once
 wiking	dist-cum
 wiking	:D
 wiking	that's another great one
 blackburn	that was task for sth like 'mathematical analysis'
 wiking	calculs ;)
 wiking	calculus
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	calculus right
 wiking	math anal
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	wiking: just today my neighbor gsomix showed me their teacher sent zad.zip
 blackburn	must be 'zadanie' - task/problem
 blackburn	but zad is effectively ass you know probably

 sonne|work	wiking: heh
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea how the discussion yesterday night went on
 sonne|work	but what are your complaints exactly?
 blackburn	sonne|work: he is just like me :D
 sonne|work	blackburn: which means?
 wiking	that realloc api
 wiking	nonstandard
 blackburn	sonne|work: marvin
 sonne|work	I see
 wiking	ah shit
 sonne|work	wiking: yes I know. I couldn't come up with any standard solution. If you have an idea speak up
 wiking	i forgot to change sparsematrix
 sonne|work	wiking: fwiw I don't like it either but whenever we do realloc in shogun we know the old size so this is the least intrusive change
 wiking	mmm
 sonne|work	the only other option I see is to use new SGVector<int>[10]() and delete[] throughout the code
 sonne|work	etc
 blackburn	or restrict realloc for sgvectors
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah but then we cannot use DynArray for SGvector
 blackburn	bad
 sonne|work	blackburn: btw you said std::vector works for cases that need inplace constructors?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am curious would http://ustl.sourceforge.net/ work for you?
 blackburn	sonne|work: vector calls constructors yes
 blackburn	it has no chance to fail on that no matter what class it is
 sonne|work	blackburn: any idea how it know when to call constructors?
 blackburn	sonne|work: what do you mean 'when'?
 sonne|work	I mean vector of double works too right?
 sonne|work	well it needs to know that it can call the constructor
 blackburn	yes why not
 blackburn	are you sure new double[]() doesn't work?
 blackburn	I think it does actually
 sonne|work	I didn't try but then I wonder why plain new[] exists...
 wiking	?
 blackburn	sonne|work: take a look at stl code :)
 wiking	blackburn: new double[] should work
 blackburn	wiking: new double[30]();?
 wiking	mmm
 sonne|work	blackburn: well it compiles...
 blackburn	hahaha youtube is banned in my country OKAY
 wiking	blackburn: lol?
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	what happened?
 blackburn	youtube is illegal :D
 blackburn	lol
 wiking	blackburn: can u open it still?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	so what?
 blackburn	but won't be able soon I think
 wiking	if they catch u watching it, then they'll come and fuck you up? :)
 blackburn	they introduced a list of sites that are denied
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	the blacklist
 blackburn	so just a few hours ago they put youtube there
 wiking	i mean hey
 blackburn	and now ISPs will deny it
 wiking	you don't wanna watch that shit anyways
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn	haha right
 wiking	maybe there's THAT kind of content there :P
 blackburn	wiking: they tried to ban it before because of 'innocence of muslims'
 blackburn	fucking muslims they are trouble makers all around the world
 wiking	another fixfuck for shogun

 wiking	blackburn: what should new double[]() be?
 blackburn	wiking: call ctor of double
 sonne|work	wiking: double[]

-shogungit:#shogun- shogun/master 810c9e5 Sergey Lisitsyn: Merge pull request #832 from vigsterkr/master...
 sonne|work	maybe it inits with 0's ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	wiking: did you convert all places that call SGSparseMatrix?
 sonne|work	I mean otherwise stuff is transposed...
 blackburn	sonne|work: wait but doesn't new Class[] call constructors?
 sonne|work	blackburn: no
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah i've tried to cover all of it as you can see in the patch
 sonne|work	or?
 sonne|work	wiking: k
 blackburn	sonne|work: so you mean new Class[30] is unsafe later? I am unsure about that
 sonne|work	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/620137/do-the-parentheses-after-the-type-name-make-a-difference-with-new
 wiking	blackburn: new should call the default ctor
 sonne|work	crazy crazy crazy
 sonne|work	didn't know one can write new Class;
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes sure one can
 blackburn	but I was unsure about new[]() and new[]
 blackburn	so we just can use new[] and it will work nice
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah but it has a different meaning
 blackburn	what's different?
 sonne|work	look at the above link
 wiking	sonne|work: well depends  ;)
 wiking	i mean blackburn :)
 wiking	it depends
 blackburn	sonne|work: no, new[] would work in all our cases I think
 wiking	i mean if u pass a class
 sonne|work	blackburn: no I think it won't work like in the above link stuff will be uninited
 wiking	then it should work as all classes have by default a ctor and even a copy ctor (as c++ automagically defines one) if you dont enforce it to be private
 blackburn	sonne|work: things like int?
 sonne|work	uninited
 blackburn	sonne|work: okay actually new[size]() is ok for me
 blackburn	it is rather universal
 blackburn	always works no matter simple type or class is used
 wiking	we always have default ctor for every class anyways for serialization
 sonne|work	blackburn: yeah for 'higher' types that makes sense
 blackburn	wiking: sonne|work it took 2 hr to recognize they are doing something wrong and youtube is not banned anymore :D
 wiking	:>
 wiking	that was fast actually
 blackburn	great soviet firewall
