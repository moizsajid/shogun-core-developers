@wiking	Saurabh7: ping
 Saurabh7	wiking: hi
@wiking	Saurabh7: which backend r u looking into for knn?
@wiking	have missed that from your email
 Saurabh7	wiking: https://github.com/FALCONN-LIB/FALCONN
@wiking	ah falconn
@wiking	ok
@wiking	how's that actually?
@wiking	i just saw the benchmarks
@wiking	when i sent u the link
@wiking	seems like a nice header only thingy
 Saurabh7	yes we might need to alter a few things like dense vectors
@wiking	?
 Saurabh7	and use our own
@wiking	currently what sorts of vector does knn support?
@wiking	i mean featureS?
@wiking	only dense features?
@wiking	and i guess only float64_t ?:)
 Saurabh7	well I can see Features*
 Saurabh7	but i think internally if we use kdtree too
 Saurabh7	it will work with only densefeatures only
 Saurabh7	wiking: falcon uses datastructers like DenseVector<float>
 Saurabh7	DenseVector<double>
 Saurabh7	SparseVector<float>
 Saurabh7	SparseVector<double>
 Saurabh7	which i think should be eigen one only
 Saurabh7	so that should be changed a bit to work with shoguns Features right ?
 Saurabh7	other than that their implementations of hash tables and stuff seems to be headersonly
 Saurabh7	brb a bit
