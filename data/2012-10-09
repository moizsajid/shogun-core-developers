 wiking	sonne|work: hey, btw: do you have download statistics of shogun 2.0 release? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea...
 wiking	sonne|work: do u have the apache logs?:)
 sonne|work	maybe that http://freecode.com/projects/shogun/date_metrics
 sonne|work	or that http://mloss.org/software/viewstats/2/
 sonne|work	http://mloss.org/software/downloadstats/2/
 sonne|work	wiking: no apache on that machine but fapws3
 wiking	but it has logs right? :)
 sonne|work	no
 wiking	none? :)
 wiking	how come :)
 sonne|work	it sends me emails with error msg if sth goes wrong but no more
 wiking	i see :S
 wiking	btw do we have something like a linked list structure in shogun?
 sonne|work	CList ?
 blackburn	std::list
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	*tatatata*
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	kalaschnikov
 blackburn	sonne|work: copy(vec.begin(), vec.end(), inserter(v, v.begin());
 blackburn	sonne|work: BOOST:SHARED_PTR
 blackburn	feel da pain? :)
 sonne|work	memmove(blackburn)
 sonne|work	free(blackburn)
 blackburn	memcpy
 wiking	:D
 sonne|work	realloc(blackburn)
 blackburn	noooo
 blackburn	std::allocator<blackburn>
 blackburn	sonne|work: FUNCTORS!
 blackburn	sonne|work: CHAR_TRAITS!
 blackburn	sonne|work: abstract factory! singleton!
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	sonne|work: MVC! dependency injection!
 blackburn	wiking: CLEARCASE!
 wiking	yey
 wiking	mvc is cool
 blackburn	wiking: dependency injection as well
 blackburn	wiking: and boost and stl and all the things sonne|work hate :D
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	yeah boost is cool
 wiking	it's a bit bloated though
 wiking	but still cool
 blackburn	I learned it a bit when doing test task for the company
 blackburn	enjoyed to do some things
 sonne|work	BLOOOOOOATED
 sonne|work	using boost increases shogun compile time by factor 10
 blackburn	sonne|work: without libraries we've got a lot or redundant code as well
 wiking	sonne|work: but just compile time :)
 sonne|work	blackburn: I don't mind libraries
 blackburn	sonne|work: especially standard template one :)
 sonne|work	...to link against
 blackburn	and the nobel prize goes to quantum guys
 sonne|work	btw
 sonne|work	http://wbailer.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/shogun-machine-learning-toolbox-under-win64/
 wiking	"applications exists on exceptions from SG_ERROR"
 wiking	this is the normal case :)
 wiking	it's not a limitation
 wiking	hahah who's up for this one: "MemoryMappedFile is not implemented (needs reimplementation based on Win API
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	I don't think it is implemented even in linux :)
 sonne|work	wiking: well no - in cmdline interface it should just return to command prompt
 sonne|work	but command line ansi characters can be disabled
 wiking	sonne|work: what's with that elwms interface? they had it in the previous macports file
 wiking	so i wonder how do we support it in 2.0
 wiking	i've never used it....
 wiking	blackburn: have u managed clang_complete to complete for stl?
 blackburn	wiking: it was working IIRC
 blackburn	wiking: I wish clang_complete showed doc
 blackburn	wiking: do you know whether it is possible?
 blackburn	maybe it is not that hard to patch it for that, I don't know
 sonne|work	wiking: probably not too important... it is one .so file that can be used as R extension, python extension, octave & matlab extensiuon at the same time while even enabling to transfer matrices etc across languages (e.g. one can run python from octave etc)
 sonne|work	wiking: I used that to slowly transition away from matlab - but I wanted to call my newly written python code
 sonne|work	and e.g. use matplotlib
 wiking	sonne|work: oh
 wiking	sonne|work: i think i'll remove it then :D
 wiking	sonne|work: none the less the port file is now in a good shape
 wiking	wonder how long it'll take to apply it to the repo
 wiking	somebody already tested it and gave some feedback so i've chnaged some minor stuff
 sonne|work	wiking: probably faster than getting into debian
 blackburn	sonne|work: 6 minutes support reaction time! faster than all that enterprise :D
 blackburn	(see mailing list)
 sonne|work	but your answer doesn't help
 sonne|work	he used exactly that right?
 sonne|work	I think he is missing lapack/blas/atlas
 blackburn	sonne|work: no, he used wrong names
 blackburn	only one is right but yes you are right he must be missing blas
 sonne|work	LIBLINEAR_L2R_L1LOSS_SVC_DUAL                 else if (strcmp(name,"LIBLINEAR_L2R_L1LOSS_SVC_DUAL")==0)
 sonne|work	ok
 blackburn	sonne|work: we should have a QA
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	blackburn: we have :)
 blackburn	sonne|work: users?
 blackburn	they could give up too early

 blackburn	hey heiko
 heiko	hey blackburn
 blackburn	heiko: got you message, where should I answer? :)
 heiko	email best, I have food on the oven and have to go there now :)
 heiko	I just found the pyramid match kernel that might be worth a try
 blackburn	heiko: is it 1/0 image?
 blackburn	or black/white means no color?
 blackburn	heiko: pyramid thing seems to be good idea but I'd recommend to think about features construction
 heiko	8bit image
 heiko	ok
 heiko	i am back
 blackburn	heiko: back? then lets chat :)
 heiko	ok
 blackburn	heiko: any assumptions on the 2d relations?
 heiko	energy fields
 heiko	so spatial relationship or at least distance is important
 blackburn	anything about neighborhood?
 blackburn	can you say neighborhood of one 'pixel' radius matter
 blackburn	or more?
 heiko	no that should be fine
 heiko	the radius
 blackburn	first idea came to me is LBP
 heiko	what is that?
 blackburn	it is a method of constructing features of images
 blackburn	useful for textures and faces
 heiko	dont know
 heiko	I mean, these fields are not really images
 blackburn	let me briefly describe
 heiko	but ok
 blackburn	for each 'pixel'
 blackburn	we compare it with its neighbors
 blackburn	so we've got result of 8 compares
 blackburn	like left pixel is greater than center
 heiko	k
 blackburn	right pixel is less than center
 blackburn	then we compute histograms of such results
 blackburn	like in block B we've got mostly left greater than right
 blackburn	so the histogram describes pattern in the block
 blackburn	got what I mean?
 heiko	yes get it
 blackburn	good thing for you is that we have it in shogun :D
 heiko	any experience with that? :)
 blackburn	heiko: I know it works good on faces, not that good on road signs (but ok)
 blackburn	heiko: face detectors works very good with it
 heiko	I see
 heiko	work on the histograms?
 heiko	with svm for example
 blackburn	heiko: for histograms best way is to map they explicitly using HomogeneousKernelMap
 blackburn	and work like in typical linear space
 blackburn	with no kernel
 blackburn	fast and nearly no accuracy loss
 heiko	HomogeneousKernelMap just takes a bunch of histograms and produces a sparse representation of them?
 blackburn	heiko: no, unfortunately not sparse and of 3x size
 blackburn	but linear
 blackburn	say you have kernel
 blackburn	<x,y> = \sum_i min(x_i, y_i)
 blackburn	then HKM is a map M
 blackburn	<Mx,My> = k(x,y)
 blackburn	flaw is that Mx is have to be at least 3 times bigger
 heiko	I see
 blackburn	it comes from fourier
 blackburn	so sin, cos and 1
 heiko	well that sounds like a good approach
 heiko	do you have any lbp code?
 blackburn	heiko: shogun/features/LBPPyrDotFeatures.cpp
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	you could try that first
 heiko	no documentation :(
 blackburn	unfortunately
 heiko	but dense_dot  is implemented
 heiko	blackburn, looks like the code does what you said
 blackburn	heiko: yeah I know :D
 blackburn	heiko: did you plot these fields?
 heiko	no, just reading the code
 blackburn	heiko: I mean ones you are classifying
 heiko	oh, yes I did
 heiko	very sparse
 heiko	and I cannot find a pattern
 heiko	with my eye and brain
 blackburn	what are the classes?
 heiko	binary
 heiko	svm with RBF kernel gives about 60% accuracy
 heiko	but using vectors of the images is not good
 blackburn	yes bad idea always
 heiko	only 1D local structure
 heiko	how to do this best with shogun
 heiko	there is only this dense_dot method
 blackburn	heiko: so looks like noise for you?
 heiko	I have to create a matrix of all the dot products and then use as custom kernel matrix right?
 blackburn	heiko: why? add is here to
 heiko	blackburn, more or less, yes
 blackburn	o
 heiko	add?
 blackburn	yeah line 286
 heiko	what can I do with add? :)
 blackburn	it is COFFIN features in general
 blackburn	add and dense dot is the best a cat can get
 heiko	how to use then?
 blackburn	with liblinear or ocas
 blackburn	just like dense features
 heiko	so just pass these features to liblinear and thats it?
 blackburn	yeah if there is no bug there yes
 blackburn	other way is to employ opencv but I'd recommend shogun first
 blackburn	heiko: did you try dimreduction?
 heiko	why?
 heiko	no I didnt but this should be pointless here
 heiko	svm are designed to work in high dimensions
 blackburn	heh no, not for features construction
 blackburn	for visualization
 heiko	i see
 heiko	how would you do that?
 blackburn	heiko: is data big?
 heiko	never tried this
 heiko	individual images are not
 heiko	but I have 20000 of them :)
 blackburn	do you have 4-5 gb of free ram then?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	I have
 heiko	but what would you do?
 blackburn	well I'd try MDS
 blackburn	just to see whether some compactness is here
 blackburn	heiko: create MultidimensionalScaling()
 blackburn	call set_landmark(true)
 blackburn	set_landmark_number(2000)
 blackburn	uhh I am bad
 blackburn	it would compute all 20000x20000 distances
 blackburn	still if you don't mind call set_target_dim(2)
 blackburn	and call embed on your features
 heiko	what do I get?
 blackburn	it will output 2d embedding (dense features)
 heiko	what does it do?
 blackburn	scatter plot it to see how data is distributed according to distance
 heiko	I see
 heiko	well,
 blackburn	it attempts to save distances
 heiko	one thing I know is:
 heiko	I can successfully do two-sample tests on the data
 heiko	so there is a difference
 heiko	and this already happens when using image vectors
 heiko	maybe I should dig a bit in there first ...
 blackburn	MDS tries to find 2d embedding w.r.t. distances
 heiko	ok
 heiko	distances of what?
 blackburn	so far vectors are far and close are close
 blackburn	between each other
 heiko	image columns?
 blackburn	no, vectors
 blackburn	between images in general
 heiko	these are vectors
 blackburn	then yes
 heiko	ok, thanks for the hints
 heiko	Ill let you know what I got
 blackburn	heiko: okay, will wait for  that
 heiko	probably will take a while - you know I am slow :D
 blackburn	heiko: did you try to find anything about energy fields?
 heiko	no, but I also dont want to invest too much time now
 heiko	first want to get some usable results
 heiko	and then refine etc
 heiko	so imaging stuff might be a good start
 blackburn	I think MRF could be a good idea but I am a bit lame in graphical models
 heiko	yeah same here
 heiko	actually, there is this new kernel belief propagation which can do inference in pairwise MRF
 heiko	this could be wortha try
 blackburn	heiko: Ising model was created for something like that
 heiko	but I havent yet understood it :)
 blackburn	in 1934 :D
 heiko	lol :)
 blackburn	heiko: belief propagation kernel? interessant to see
 heiko	I am planning to implement that into graphlab btw :)
 blackburn	darf ich ansehen?
 heiko	If I find some time
 blackburn	what is graphlab?
 heiko	http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/kernelBP/kernelBP.htm
 heiko	an open-source distriuted graph-based ML software
 heiko	can do stuff like pagerank in a distributed fashion
 blackburn	I see
 heiko	and graphical models fit in there very well
 blackburn	heiko: did I say that right in german? :D
 heiko	nein :)
 blackburn	argh
 heiko	what did you want to say exactly?
 blackburn	what is wrong?
 heiko	Darf ich mal sehen - but that is really slangy :)
 blackburn	well I tried to change typical 'darf ich vorstellen' (I learned that from a book :D)
 heiko	Kannst du mir das zeigen
 heiko	would be better
 blackburn	can you show me?
 blackburn	^
 blackburn	I know du and kannst and das
 heiko	there is the subject missing thats also wrong in english :)
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	heiko: where?
 heiko	can you show me what?
 blackburn	ah well not that wrong I thought
 blackburn	I mean when we are talking and you got what I mean :)
 heiko	yes, its just a language thing
 heiko	you always have a subject in any roman language
 blackburn	yeah I know
 blackburn	but it is lost sometimes still, right?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	especially in chatrooms
 blackburn	heiko: I am now developing that test task thing - got totally crazy with design
 blackburn	EntityManager + EntityFactory + EntityLoader + EntityKeeper
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	lol :D
 blackburn	I should stop describing new entities of entities
 blackburn	or I will end with a metamodel
 blackburn	of a metamodel
 blackburn	heiko: may be it is good that sonney2k is here to stop my crazy intentions :D
 heiko	hehe
 blackburn	heiko: if I get that job I am going to become commercial counterpart of alex binder :D
 blackburn	mostly the same that he does
 heiko	wow
 heiko	cool thing
 heiko	you two then can join each other to create a super ML monster :LD
 blackburn	we should all meet and constuct a MLdzilla
 heiko	hehe
 blackburn	heiko: I recently noticed that not only shogun slowed down, scikits is being developed by other people now
 heiko	shogun slowed down?
 blackburn	well two commits per week
 blackburn	or so
 heiko	I see
 heiko	ok
 heiko	but we got the gsoc stuff
 heiko	that was massive this time
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko	I am still working quite a bit, but the streaming framework is so broken that I cannot commit :)
 heiko	spent almost all yesterday trying to fix the stuff
 blackburn	I will become active once I get or not get the job
 heiko	but hope to be done soon
 blackburn	now I am thinking how to design that thing not to look stupid
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	however I have to hurry up, I said it will be ready by 11
 blackburn	of oct
 heiko	ok
 heiko	then gogogog :)
 blackburn	it works already but they asked multithreading
 blackburn	thinking how to avoid redundant locks..
 heiko	wow
 heiko	lots of things
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	and JSON
 blackburn	for loading
 blackburn	they didn't ask for JSON but it seems to be easier for me
 blackburn	than handcrafting my own format
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ahh and UML
 heiko	cool !: :)
 heiko	alothough
 heiko	although I hate UML
 blackburn	class diagram is ok
 blackburn	I hate sequence diagram
 blackburn	I've never seen a process that is simplified by a sequence diagram
 blackburn	wasting paper maybe
 blackburn	or spending time to avoid doing things at job :)
 heiko	I also never saw this
 heiko	when the processes are easy, it works fine, but then you dont need a diagram
 heiko	when the processes are complicated, its a mess
 heiko	better use plain blackboard :)
 blackburn	heiko: the only thing is that there are some big companies
 blackburn	but they should rather disappear
 blackburn	oracle especially
 heiko	what do you mean?
 blackburn	they have to work with all that IDEF0, UML, anything
 blackburn	because they are so big that person means nothing
 blackburn	it should work even if robots come
 heiko	hehe you got a quite bad image of these guys dont you? :)
 blackburn	heiko: do SAP and oracle deserve respect? :)
 heiko	lol SAP
 heiko	I heard a talk of this statistical analysis software
 heiko	how is it called again?
 heiko	the guy was in our uni early this year
 heiko	SAS
 heiko	dude, this software is ridiculus
 blackburn	yes, SAS
 blackburn	heiko: no idea about that, what does it contain? kmeans and linear regression?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	and programming in comic sans :)
 blackburn	oracle data mining is the same thing
 blackburn	it has kmeans, svm and apriori
 blackburn	not even fp-tree, just apriori
 blackburn	hey 70s
 heiko	yes
 heiko	but this will change
 heiko	for all the new methods, you really need to know what you are doing
 blackburn	yeah once we get super semi svm they will get MKL
 heiko	yeah maybe
 heiko	I mean these things require quite some knowledge
 heiko	but KMeans does not
 blackburn	sure but I don't think they aim data mining products for people who doesn't know what data mining is
 heiko	MKL, man, this is so specialised knowledge
 blackburn	I understand, just some example
 heiko	yeah
 heiko	I prefer open-source stuff anyway
 heiko	but companies need reliable things that are known to work
 heiko	and these products offer this
 blackburn	no they need money :)
 heiko	they also can generate power-point presentations from data :)
 blackburn	yeah that's true business thing
 heiko	btw just running two-sample tests on the vectorised images with gaussian kernel
 heiko	and I get 0% type 2 error
 heiko	strange that the SVM fails
 heiko	at least now I know which kernel to use to maximise differences between the classes
 blackburn	heh yeah statistical approach would work too I think
 blackburn	however you are the expert here
 heiko	this stuff is related
 heiko	there is a formal connection between linear hard margin SVM and MMD test
 heiko	so if two-sample test works good, svm should work well too
 blackburn	there are connections between svm and everything :)
 heiko	indeed :)
