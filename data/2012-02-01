 n4nd0	hi
 n4nd0	I am interested in gsoc 2012, I know that the organizations have not even been selected yet
 n4nd0	but I would like to start getting a bit in shogun in case it is selected I can make a good proposal
 blackburn	n4nd0: hi
 blackburn	n4nd0: well gsoc was not announced too (yet)
 blackburn	:)
 Ram108	blackburn: hi do u mind if i seek some help?
 n4nd0	blackburn, yeah, that's right :)
 blackburn	Ram108: sure
 n4nd0	blackburn, but I guess it will run again this year
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah, some evidences are here already: http://www.google-melange.com/soc/content/2-0-20120131/images/v2/gsoc/logo/banner-gsoc2012.png
 n4nd0	blackburn, and anyway, if it doesn't, I would like to learn more about machine learning and this can be a good place to do it :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: how familiar are you with ml?
 Ram108	i ll catch u tomorrow......... my laptop ll run out of charge in a min and i dont have an outlet to charge
 Ram108	lol bye have a great day
 n4nd0	blackburn, I have taken some courses at the university about ml and applied it for the projects in the courses
 blackburn	Ram108: sure, feel free to write emails
 Ram108	:)
 blackburn	Ram108: see you
 Ram108	thanks :)
 Ram108	bye :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok so what is the most interesting subarea in ml for you? I'm just curious what to suggest
-!- Ram108 [~amma@14.96.158.159] has quit [Quit: Ex-Chat]
 n4nd0	blackburn, so in one course we talked about kernel functions I found them really cool, I have not applied them to anything though
 n4nd0	blackburn, I would like to learn more about them
 blackburn	n4nd0: kernels, like in svms?
 n4nd0	blackburn, yes
 blackburn	hmm we have a lot of them :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, but are they just for svms or also for more stuff?
 blackburn	n4nd0: well kernels are used in svms very often
 n4nd0	blackburn, all right, I believed they were also applied to other stuff
 blackburn	they are
 n4nd0	blackburn, I like svms anyway so it is cool
 blackburn	for example I 'specialize' in dimensionality reduction
 blackburn	and there are some kernel methods
 n4nd0	ok, I see
 n4nd0	and apart from the subarea in ml I am interested, what is interesting for the toolbox to have?
 n4nd0	what are you working on?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'm author of all dimensionality reduction methods in shogun
 blackburn	an *
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	well this year I'll probably be working on domain adaptation or multitask learning
 blackburn	do you know anything about structured output learning?
 n4nd0	sincerely not
 blackburn	okk what about langs you are familiar with?
 blackburn	n4nd0: http://shogun-toolbox.org/edrt/ that's the thing I'm mainly working at :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, I work the most with C++ and matlab/octave
 n4nd0	blackburn, but I can work in java and python also
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	well how do you want to start 'shoguning'? :)
 blackburn	you could write some examples or extend with new kernels or distances
 n4nd0	blackburn, haha that's the big question
 blackburn	or anything similar
 n4nd0	blackburn, I don't really know, I guess almost anything could work
 n4nd0	blackburn, that sounds good
 n4nd0	maybe I can start with examples and later go more into extending some functionality / creating new stuff
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	with which tasks you was involved?
 blackburn	classification?
 blackburn	in your studies I mean
 blackburn	I would suggest you to reproduce it with shogun
 n4nd0	I worked on face recognition
 blackburn	oh nice
 blackburn	on which datasets?
 n4nd0	digit recognition and stuff like that
 blackburn	ok so you know mnist and ORL at least, right?
 n4nd0	we implemented the paper of Viola and Jones
 n4nd0	boosting with haar like features
 blackburn	hmm I see
 blackburn	do you have your own code for haar-like features you can integrate?
 n4nd0	we did the full implementation in matlab
 n4nd0	so I would have to look for it but yes, I must have that code
 blackburn	ok then my suggestion is:
 blackburn	there could be some script
 blackburn	that 1) downloads some dataset like olivetti or so
 blackburn	2) constructs these features
 blackburn	3) classifies with shogun's classifiers
 n4nd0	compare different classifiers?
 blackburn	well could be nice too
 blackburn	but even with only one classifier it works well too
 n4nd0	all right
 blackburn	sounds like a plan?
 n4nd0	sounds like a nice plan :)
 blackburn	you may contact me via blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	or here, in irc
 n4nd0	ok, thank you
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	I will start then refreshing what I did in my lab to compute the features and later decide the classifier to use
 n4nd0	is it ok to start out with my matlab code? or would it be better in C++ or any other?
 blackburn	n4nd0: does it work with octave?
 blackburn	python is preferrable but no need to rewrite it if it is already working with octave
 n4nd0	blackburn, I think it should work with octave, I don't think I used anything fancy, but I should try it out first
 n4nd0	blackburn, so if the part that I have already written to compute the Haar features works well in octave, can it be used from python later?
 blackburn	n4nd0: sure just decompose it to features.m and classify.py :)
 n4nd0	blackburn,  cool
 blackburn	n4nd0: are you from sweden? :)
 n4nd0	blackburn, no, but I live in Sweden
 n4nd0	:)
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn, where are you from? Sweden or Scandinavia maybe?
 blackburn	where are you from then (if it is not a secret)? :)
 n4nd0	Spain
 blackburn	n4nd0: well my name is Sergey :)
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	so I'm russian
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	blackburn, was it just a good guess :P? or did you find something related to my nickname and Sweden?
 blackburn	from cold country too hah
 n4nd0	haha yes

 n4nd0	blackburn, so did you have any classifier in particular that could work well with the haar features?
 blackburn	n4nd0: unfortunately I'm not very familiar with haar features
 n4nd0	blackburn, in the implementation I have I use weak classifiers with boosting
 blackburn	well it is easy to try different ones
 blackburn	with shogun I mean
 n4nd0	does the toolbox include boosting then?
 blackburn	we only have LPBoost currently
 n4nd0	I am not familiare with it
 blackburn	me neither
