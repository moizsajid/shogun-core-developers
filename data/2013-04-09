 debajyoti	hi, I am new here. can someone guide me with subscribing to the mailing list? thanks
 medeeiip	send an empty mail to shogun-list-subscribe@shogun-toolbox.org
 debajyoti	tried that about 2 hours ago.
 debajyoti	i tried to post, but failed now
 debajyoti	should i give it more time?
 medeeiip	I was going by the code for handling files. For handling files c style file pointer is used. Is there any special reason for doing this
 medeeiip	even in the functions like get_matrix() reference is passed as arguments... rather I can return a pair of references to the matrix and it's dimenssion

 blackburn	naywhayare: I just read your application form - are you planning to get a lot of guys who know SFINAE and CRTP? :D
 naywhayare	blackburn: no, I don't expect to, but how people answer those questions will tell me a lot about them (if they choose to answer) and that will help with the filtering
 naywhayare	note that one of the "challenge questions" is actually the halting problem :)
 naywhayare	the responses to that, if people respond, should be entertaining, but they should also tell us a lot about who to avoid...
 blackburn	naywhayare: I expect quite a few will answer you with something reasonable :)
 naywhayare	I would have made the application less intimidating (I'm not sure intimidating is the right word), but considering that I already have a bunch of people begging for more information, some amount of filtering seems necessary

 n4nd0	sonne|work: good morning!
 n4nd0	I had an idea, we could add an initiation task in github suited for the people interested in the demos/django project
 n4nd0	to integrate the history revision in the admin interface :)
-!- akshay_hebbar [~akshay@117.192.220.88] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	providing that it seems several people are interested in this project, maybe someone can get it done soon. I think we sort of *need* this feature

 sonne|work	n4nd0: hey there!
 sonne|work	blackburn: I was already wondering :D

 sonne|work	n4nd0: IDK

 sonne|work	n4nd0: because it is totally unrelated to the task - then I would rather want them to directly do stuff in d3js or some form via which one can upload data to the shogun server
 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm I see. I though django was also important for this project.
-!- phd [~lvoronova@77-120-201-195.sumy.volia.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 256 seconds]
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes that is in django
 sonne|work	but working one some stuff on the website - hmmhh totally unrelated to ML and core shogun isn't such a nice thing
 sonne|work	IMHO this just has to be done and people should rather do ML & real applications
 n4nd0	sonne|work: Ok, I understand your point
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=LrXWD8tWEcU I should be careful in that city :D

 blackburn	sonne|work: do you know aanything on SOCP?
 medeeiip	I was going by the code for handling files. For handling files c style file pointer is used. Is there any special reason for doing this
 blackburn	medeeiip: c style file pointer? what do you mean?
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes sure
 medeeiip	i mean FILE* f; type handling of any file
 medeeiip	no use of fstream
 blackburn	sonne|work: because I have nothing to answer to cheng :)
 blackburn	medeeiip: I see
 blackburn	medeeiip: I don't think there is a special reason to do that
 medeeiip	 even in the functions like get_matrix() reference is passed as arguments through which value is returned... rather I can return a pair of references to the matrix and it's dimenssion

-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	medeeiip: why to create a new object to handle that?
 sonne|work	medeeiip: we had typemaps so we could use python files directly in shogun
 sonne|work	medeeiip: mapping FILE* <-> python
 medeeiip	of course there will be change in ovarall code.. But using fstream implementing program(program using shogun library) will be a lot safer..... vary low chance of memory leak
 medeeiip	@blackburn you mean fstream?
 blackburn	medeeiip: I mean pair
 medeeiip	because pair is lightweight and can return multiple things at once.....
 medeeiip	i feel in todays computer this much memory would put a constrient
 blackburn	what is that lightweight in pair? it is an object
 medeeiip	i mean wouldn't@blackburn
 medeeiip	an object containing only two reference
 blackburn	pair do not contain references
-!- jptech93 [~quassel@115.248.130.148] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
 blackburn	it contains objects
 blackburn	or values of PODs
 medeeiip	if i return a pair like pair<int&,int&> what is wrong?
 blackburn	that doesn't sound much safer than what we have
-!- foulwall [~foulwall@li379-21.members.linode.com] has joined #shogun
 medeeiip	i'm not saying pair is safer..........
 medeeiip	I'm saying using fstream instade of FILE is safer
 medeeiip	and pair is simple ...and easy to work with
 blackburn	medeeiip: so I have to rewrite it as you don't like it, right?
 medeeiip	I'm not saying that..... I'm just taking opinion.... That's all
 medeeiip	shogun has posted a idea for gsoc about improving file support.... For this what specifically you are asking for?
 medeeiip	The post said overall improvement of code quality
 blackburn	yes and if you have suggestions feel free to make them come true :)
 medeeiip	that's ok... but what your org mean to say by saying improvement of overall code quality
 blackburn	medeeiip: changing it to fstream might be an example of improving code quality
 medeeiip	thank you 'n btw one more general question: where buglist of shogun is mentained?
-!- ahcorde [c1934d18@gateway/web/freenode/ip.193.147.77.24] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	medeeiip: github issues
 blackburn	medeeiip: the problem with legacy things like FILE is that we don't really have time to rewrite code
 blackburn	and if we rewrite it we should cover it with unit-tests
 medeeiip	you mean file handling
 blackburn	medeeiip: that's not the only example of not-the-best-C++-practice
 blackburn	but we are more or less sure it is working so changing working code with prettier code is not the way to go - it should be properly tested then
 medeeiip	I'mean you are asking unit tests for what?
 blackburn	medeeiip: I mean if we change code we need unit-tests
 medeeiip	Got it......
 blackburn	so far we had no power neither to rewrite code nor write unit-tests for that
 medeeiip	how?
 blackburn	that's why we hope students will help to improve the code
 blackburn	how what?
 medeeiip	how you had no power to rewrite code?
 blackburn	there are a few of us only here and we have real jobs :)
 blackburn	be back soon

 ahcorde	Hello, I'm Alex, I'm studying a Master of Computer Vision. Few months ago I forked the repository on github because I used this library to develop some of my pattern recognition practices. I would like to start to help in this library. I visit in github project page the issues and I'm try to patch the problem with json serialization. I don't know if someone can tell me which is the best way to start to develop in Shogun.
 blackburn	ahcorde: the best way is to find something you can fix/improve
 blackburn	and do that :)
 n4nd0	ahcorde is also one of my dearest friends from uni :)
 blackburn	I am sure we have a great room for improvement so it should not be a problem

 blackburn	heiko: what is wrong?
 heiko	mention gsoc
 heiko	its only on the events page
 n4nd0	heiko: it is on the main page as well
 heiko	n4nd0: not here
 n4nd0	ah BTW, I wrote yesterday a couple of tweets in ShogunToolbox, so please retweet them
 heiko	n4nd0: I dont use twitter apart from shogun :)
 sonne|work	heiko: what?
 heiko	but thanks for doing it
 heiko	so I dont see gsoc on the mainpage, I have to click on news

 heiko	blind!
 heiko	 :)

 n4nd0	sonne|work: I wrote in my blog about gsoc too
 heiko	sonne|work: yes, thats what distracted me :)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: very good!
 n4nd0	sonne|work: in case you want to reblog or sth
 sonne|work	heiko: IDK how many students did contact you but I am swamped
 n4nd0	sonne|work: haha all of them for demos?
 blackburn	sonne|work: demoooos more demoos
 heiko	sonne|work, not a single one so far :)
 heiko	we can have two demo projects
 n4nd0	or 8
 heiko	one for this internet stuff
 sonne|work	large scale
 n4nd0	:D
 sonne|work	demos, file IO
 heiko	and one only for cool visualisations
 blackburn	I didn't receive any email on dim reduction
 sonne|work	maybe due to the natural up -> down reading
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will mail you to cheer you up if you want :P
 blackburn	hahah
 n4nd0	haha that would be pretty lame, if we actually just get applications for the proposals on top because people don't read all

 blackburn	entropy component analysis?
 heiko	Entropy component analysis
 heiko	yes
 sonne|work	heiko: kernel ECA?
 heiko	instead of taking the eigenvectors with most signal in the RKHS
 heiko	you take those that maximise the entropy in the *input* space
 heiko	with this you get quite different results
 heiko	sonne|work: yes
 blackburn	heiko: do you have any good reference?
 sonne|work	heiko: hmmhh so it finds you the most relevant input dims wrt the kernel used?
 heiko	sonne|work: kernel acts as a smoothing operator on the distribution in the input space, Ill search a reference
 heiko	they define some entropy using the kernel
 heiko	so there is the connection
 heiko	http://ansatte.uit.no/rje001/PDF/04912217(2).pdf
 blackburn	heiko: I am a bit lost
 blackburn	they speak about RKHS and parzen window

 heiko	in fact
 heiko	the computation is easy
 heiko	just a norm changes compared to kernel pca
 heiko	you might want to check this out
 heiko	might be an entrance task
 heiko	the algo he showed was very similar to pca
 blackburn	heiko: I have everything to compute largest eigenvalues/vectors
 heiko	you dont use the largest eigenvalues
 heiko	but I dont know all details
 heiko	you are the expert on this field :)
 blackburn	heiko: which eigenvalues I would need?
 heiko	they might be further down the line
 heiko	like 1-3-29
 blackburn	uh
 blackburn	full eigendecomposition?
 heiko	blackburn: check the paper! I dont know :)
 heiko	this it what it boils down to
 blackburn	yeah checking
 heiko	I dont know how they compute
 blackburn	heiko: yes full
 blackburn	I don't like that!

 heiko	hate is such a strong word blackburn :)
 blackburn	they need fine tuning
 blackburn	heiko: w/o regularization LLE is not solvable at all
 blackburn	so it makes more degrees of freedom
 sonne|work	heiko: urgs I know Robert
 heiko	sonne|work: how come?
 sonne|work	he was at TU and we have some paper together
 heiko	oh yes
 blackburn	ha
 heiko	he mentioned the TU and KR M?ller
 blackburn	I propose to implement techniques for dimensionality reduction and metric learning which are currently missing in scikit-learn.
 blackburn	http://homepage.tudelft.nl/19j49/Matlab_Toolbox_for_Dimensionality_Reduction.html
 blackburn	There are also many kernel functions which have not been implemented.  
 blackburn	http://crsouza.blogspot.in/2010/03/kernel-functions-for-machine-learning.html
 blackburn	heiko: sonne|work: ^ from the scikits mailing list
 blackburn	LOL
 sonne|work	blackburn: so he implements this in scikits I guess right?
 sonne|work	I guess a one-linear each in python
 blackburn	sonne|work: yeah proposes to - things repeat
 blackburn	let me state the law of machine learning toolboxes development
 blackburn	'every toolbox gets to the http://crsouza.blogspot.in/2010/03/kernel-functions-for-machine-learning.html page some day'
 blackburn	hahahah
 blackburn	heiko: dailymail wrote about city I live

 heiko	man
 heiko	these Russians :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: no didn't manage to see these things for real
 blackburn	I have seen similar things but these are nice
 n4nd0	heiko: they are unbelievable :)
 heiko	n4nd0: yeah
 heiko	haha
 blackburn	heiko: n4nd0: there is an explanation why these thing happen
 n4nd0	blackburn: and that is?
 blackburn	n4nd0: old pipes
 blackburn	waterpipes I mean
 n4nd0	do they just disappear?
 blackburn	n4nd0: you know what happens to metal with time :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: it gets better
 n4nd0	like iron maiden
 blackburn	hahhah
 blackburn	n4nd0: good
 blackburn	n4nd0: anyway infrastructure have not got updated since like 80s
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	I guess it must get worse there with time providing hard weather
 blackburn	n4nd0: at least I don't have snow now :D
 blackburn	sonne|work said he had recently
 n4nd0	blackburn: wow, we still have
 n4nd0	it has been sunny every day for almost two months now
 n4nd0	well, one and a half
 blackburn	n4nd0: everything is wet and dirty now

 heiko	but this thing only offers my local branches

 blackburn	do you have 'dev' branch?
 heiko	no
 heiko	I just did git pull --rebase upstream master
 blackburn	and do you have develop branch?
 heiko	no
 blackburn	git pull upstream develop
 heiko	ah I see, I was in master branch right?
 blackburn	you downloaded only master branch
 heiko	oh
 heiko	well did not change anything
 blackburn	now it should fetch develop
 heiko	nop
 blackburn	heiko: hmm why?
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	 git pull upstream develop
 heiko	git flow  init
 heiko	but the branch is not there
 heiko	heiko@heiko-ThinkPad-T420:~/Desktop/shogun/shogun$ git branch

 blackburn	heiko: hmm let me check
 blackburn	heiko: when I did the same on my outdated copy it fetched develop branch
 blackburn	heiko: is it your fork?
 heiko	yes my fork
 heiko	should I reset everything maybe?
 blackburn	heiko: no

 blackburn	heiko: aham
 blackburn	that's an interesting case we need to resolve and *remember* how to resolve
 blackburn	heiko: because you are working on fork we need to copy that branch somehow
 heiko	ok
 heiko	so fork again?
 blackburn	heiko: git checkout --track upstream/develop
 heiko	git checkout --track upstream/develop
 heiko	fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.
 heiko	Did you intend to checkout 'upstream/develop' which can not be resolved as commit?
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	heiko: give me a few minutes I'll try to do that locally
 heiko	blackburn: I think Ill just re-fork and re-checkout
 heiko	that usually solves my problems with git
 heiko	and I usually get mad at it after 10 minutes of trying :D
 blackburn	heiko: that's not the proper way
 blackburn	heiko: oh I see you are an admin too!
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	heiko: what do you think about that modelselection thing as gsoc idea?
 heiko	which one?
 blackburn	heiko: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/959
 blackburn	heiko: kernel["width"].asLinearRange().from(0.1).to(10.0);
 heiko	blackburn: I like that
 heiko	so if we can cover all the cases (and you seemed confident in that) lets do it!
 heiko	ah
 heiko	as gsoc you mean?
 blackburn	heiko: yes
 heiko	would be an easy one right?
 blackburn	no it is not the only idea
 heiko	or not easy but small
 heiko	what are the others?
 blackburn	heiko: oh more on similar syntax
 blackburn	heiko: features.feature(0).disable()
 heiko	I see
 heiko	would you mentor that?
 blackburn	yes
 heiko	or if not who would?
 heiko	isnt that all a bit too much?
 blackburn	a bit too much of?
 heiko	work
 heiko	for you I mean
 heiko	I really like the idea btw
 blackburn	heiko: ah, don't know
 heiko	there are many things we can do for modelselection
 heiko	sonne|work also mentioned this subsampling approach
 heiko	to reduce costs of grid-search
 heiko	and also there is the thing to combine C1 C2
 blackburn	heiko: I hope I manage to carry this
 blackburn	:)
 heiko	blackburn: is there any buffer? for unforeseen things?

@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 I accepted to be a reviewer
@sonney2k	for a couple of conferences
 n4nd0	sonney2k: lot to read/do for it?
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	tough stuff
@sonney2k	usually
 n4nd0	what are the conferences?
@sonney2k	nips and some big data thing
 n4nd0	wow you are truly a big fish :)
 n4nd0	out of curiosity, how does it work to be a reviewer? I mean it in the sense if it is like a normal job or get anything in exchange for the work
@sonney2k	you do it for free
 n4nd0	aham! for research's sake
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I used to review for basically every ML conference/journal
 n4nd0	nice
 heiko	sonney2k: do you know how they select people? just got an invitation for nips reviewing and am wondering why that happened. Anything else than being an author?
 n4nd0	this is full of big fishes
 heiko	n4nd0: no not me ;)
 heiko	I declined, no idea how to do this
 n4nd0	sonney2k: you should go back to research, the world needs you
 heiko	n4nd0: haha :)
 n4nd0	heiko: c'mon nips is a big thing in the ML world (I think)
 n4nd0	so you are big fish too ;)
@sonney2k	heiko, it is a lot of work for nips
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I am no longer a real researcher
 heiko	I even struggle to understand the papers I am interested in, so I will wait a bit more before I intend to do this
@sonney2k	I mean industry research is totally different from academia
 heiko	sonney2k: I heard this, but probably also interesting
@sonney2k	heiko, that will always be the case
 heiko	sonney2k: btw why did you change frontiers?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah, I thought that. That's we need you to come back :)
@sonney2k	heiko, family
 n4nd0	That's why*
 heiko	sonney2k: so more regular working times you mean?
@sonney2k	heiko, a permanent job / income - that's it
@sonney2k	no 1-2-3 year contracts
@sonney2k	and then the risky proposal business
 heiko	sonney2k: yeh, I can understand that!
 n4nd0	let's move all to Stockholm, I have the feeling the professors here have very good lives
 heiko	being a professor should be fine almost everywhere
@sonney2k	heiko, no it is tough too
 heiko	sonney2k: but in terms of contract/income?
@sonney2k	then you even have people whose live depend on you
@sonney2k	and you need to write proposals to keep them
@sonney2k	so risk for yourself is low but you are responsible for others - if you screw up many will suffer
 n4nd0	c'mon there must some nice parts being professor as well!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, sure there is
@sonney2k	you can do whatever you want
@sonney2k	you can do research
@sonney2k	if you have cool ideas you can get people doing these for you
@sonney2k	etc

 n4nd0	sonney2k: how long were you in research after you got your Ph.D.?
@sonney2k	it took a while until I got my phd
 n4nd0	aham
@sonney2k	I did ML research in academia from 1999 to 2011 IIRC
@sonney2k	so yes I know a lot of people 'bigshots' and they know me :)
@sonney2k	I hardly remember when I did my phd was it 2007 or 9?
@sonney2k	lost
 n4nd0	no, I was thinking more that I think you have done lot of stuff for "not so many" years in research
 n4nd0	but maybe I am wrong, I have not really compared in depth
@sonney2k	phd end of 2008 :)
 n4nd0	I started uni back in 2008 I think :)
@sonney2k	I really started in 2004 (2002 I did my master, then 2 years sys admin)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how does it work when something big as your large-scale MKL paper happens?
 n4nd0	is it like a happy idea one suddenly comes up with? :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
@sonney2k	and the right people
@sonney2k	you need to have a problem you want to solve, someone with the skills and then someone doing guidance and sb doing the work...
 n4nd0	I see

 blackburn	that's what I do when I review IEEE
 n4nd0	wtf I am the only here who doesn't review anything?
 blackburn	n4nd0: that's joke nobody would ever put me to review IEEE
 blackburn	:D

 medeeiip	I's going through the source,From curiosity i'm asking: i've found SG_MALLOC() wraper macro is used to call sg_generic_malloc<>(). Does this thing somehow resolves the problem with c++ template in SWIG??
 blackburn	medeeiip: what kind of problem?
 medeeiip	I dont know much about SWIG. From basic I think I've to use template traits to support SWIG
 blackburn	medeeiip: we do not use any traits for swig
 medeeiip	blackburn: Ok! can you tall me a couple of words about how SWIG interface is implemented for template classes e.g. SGMat
 blackburn	medeeiip: it is specialized
 blackburn	SGMatrix<int32_t>, ... etc
 blackburn	are renamed to IntMatrix
@sonney2k	medeeiip, each become a new type in e.g. python
 blackburn	LongMatrix
 blackburn	and so on
 medeeiip	Ok! but about the previous question why  SG_MALLOC() macro? we could have used opencv type initialisation... Is there anything special?
@sonney2k	medeeiip, how do the opencv guys do it?
 medeeiip	they use enum {}; CV_<bit-depth>{U|S|F}C<number_of_channels> format for initialising a Mat
 medeeiip	http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/core_basic_structures.html
@sonney2k	interesting
@sonney2k	medeeiip, we use the SG_MALLOC macro mainly to use malloc / free / realloc and so we are able to directly use memory ptrs from other languages
@sonney2k	as occur in python etc
 medeeiip	is the macro is extremely necessery? From my coleg level programming exp. I think direct template based approach will be a better approach. Does it not reduces managability...... I mean hard time in debuging?
 n4nd0	medeeiip: well in the case of SGMatrix and SGVector (SGReferencedData in general) this is managed internally
 n4nd0	medeeiip: so one does not need to worry about it when using them
 n4nd0	medeeiip: in any case I am not sure how using templated can make the use of the SG_MALLOC macro not necessary. I think they address different issues

 medeeiip	i think the issue is when creating allocating memory i mean when calling  sg_generic_malloc<>() how the matrixtype template agrument will be determined, as we are not passing <int32_t> thing (from which the matrix type can be determined) [casual think]
 medeeiip	as we are passing only len (argument to  sg_generic_malloc())
 blackburn	medeeiip: SG_MALLOC is the same as sg_generic_malloc with specified type
 blackburn	just shorter
