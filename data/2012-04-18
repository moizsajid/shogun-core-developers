 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea..
 blackburn	there should be a reason though
@sonney2k	hmmhh maybe because of LIbSVMMultiClass
 blackburn	SGVector<int32_t> &svm_svs() 142+    { 143+      return svm_proto()->m_svs; 144+    }
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be that ^?
@sonney2k	m_machines = SGVector<CMachine *>(num_svms);
@sonney2k	that is sth I don't like
@sonney2k	all the rest looks pretty nice to me
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
 blackburn	I did it in the same way
 blackburn	sonney2k: m_machines = create_machines(num_svms)?
@sonney2k	blackburn, SGVector is a numeric thing
@sonney2k	e.g. SGVector a,b
@sonney2k	a+b
@sonney2k	will work at some point
 blackburn	hmm yes
 blackburn	but I prefer even stl vector here
@sonney2k	any of the Dyn*Arrays is what you should use here

 blackburn	sonney2k: have you heard of valarray btw?
 blackburn	that's the thing we wouldn't be able to ignore in the future
@sonney2k	not sure if this comes too late for us
 blackburn	sonney2k: we can always change underlying sgvector stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think it should be as fast if we provide a facade like sgvector
@sonney2k	true
@sonney2k	so today will be the anouncement of duplicate students
@sonney2k	blackburn, I gave some comments to the multiclasssvm stuff
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Quit: wiking]
@sonney2k	problem is really that this is a huge very intrusive patch
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I see mails
@sonney2k	very hard to look at
@sonney2k	but I think pluskid did a nice job
 blackburn	true
@sonney2k	maybe some of the multiclass svm proxy stuff can go away but apart from the minor changes (pending that it all still passes test!) it has my OK
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would like to merge it soon
@sonney2k	IIRC he is away now so would be good if you can give him feedback *before* he returns
@sonney2k	such that he has a fresh mind and does the final touches and we can quickly merge afterwards
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok sure
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw isn't it 4am or so at your place?
@sonney2k	sun rising already?
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm 2.16
@sonney2k	ahh not soo late then
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am just +2 from you I guess?
 blackburn	not so far away actually
 blackburn	in means of russian distances lol
 blackburn	if I was in omsk it would be +4
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I tried to do some meeting planning - but it is difficult with so many timezones
@sonney2k	someone will have to stay awake late or wake up early
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: after 23?
@sonney2k	problem is we have mentos in NY / melboune
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	all the rest is inbetween
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually I am not sure chris in NY right now
 blackburn	is in *
 blackburn	sonney2k: he visited tuebingen for some deals so I don't know where he is right now
 blackburn	but melbourne is a problem yeah
 blackburn	(just like cheng soon for me) :D
@sonney2k	so only viable time is UTC 11 or 12hrs
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, how can we get rid of the 10 open pull requests?
 blackburn	sonney2k: we don't have to
 blackburn	just live with it :D
-!- wiking [~wiking@huwico/staff/wiking] has quit [Client Quit]
@sonney2k	blackburn, you don't loose overview?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes that can be hard but I believe it should be as it is
@sonney2k	blackburn, for exampel your lib/external stuff could easily be merged if you kept Tron at its place
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would rather close things we don't merge within a few days / where there is no obvious progress for some time
@sonney2k	it doesn't help to have such requests open
 blackburn	sonney2k: I agree - my issues are slow because of my exam week

 blackburn	sonney2k: *pre-exam sorry
 blackburn	I have one on 20, and on 27, 4 and 8
 blackburn	sonney2k: however this week is much more hard for me than next will be
 blackburn	I have to get done all the things I haven't done before :D
@sonney2k	great - I guess the kickoff meeting then will have only 70% of the participants
@sonney2k	well we have chat logs

 Marty28	Does poim.py have any chance of running, now?
 n4nd0	Marty28: it looks like sonne|work fixed it yesterday
 Marty28	nice
 n4nd0	as he said, it should be ready
 Marty28	Do you know if shogun has a simple random data generator included?
 Marty28	A data converter for different file formats would also be nice.
 Marty28	I am currently writing a simple generator for DNA/RNA.
 n4nd0	Marty28: take a look at random methods in CMath and SGVector
 Marty28	Some code is in the examples as well.

 wiking	sonney2k blackburn any of you here? is there anything more required for defining a new feature type than setting the EFeatureType and EFeatureClass ?
 blackburn	wiking: nothing more
 wiking	i wonder why do i get this error then base/class_list.cpp:427:93: error: allocating an object of abstract class type 'CLatentFeatures'
 wiking	afaik i've implemented all the =0 functions...
 blackburn	wiking: get_name?
 wiking	yep i have that as well
 blackburn	wiking: do you inherit it from dotfeatures?
 wiking	i have duplicate, get_num_vectors, get_size, get_name, get_feature_type and get_feature_class implemented
 wiking	now i've inherited from cfeatures, just for simplicity...
 blackburn	hmhm
 wiking	and i still get this
 wiking	base/class_list.cpp:427:93: error: allocating an object of abstract class type 'CLatentFeatures'
 wiking	static CSGObject* __new_CLatentFeatures(EPrimitiveType g) { return g == PT_NOT_GENERIC? new CLatentFeatures(): NULL; }
 wiking	i've tried a make clean && make
 wiking	but did not help
 wiking	i really wonder now what other pure virtual functions are there that i haven't implemented yet in cfeatures
 wiking	i guess i'll check it now in the source
 blackburn	the only virtual of SGObject is get_name
 blackburn	so you have to implement only get_name + virtual funcs of cfeatures
 wiking	yep
 wiking	afaik i did it
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	wiking: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/features/DummyFeatures.cpp
 wiking	yep
 wiking	have them :)
 wiking	http://snipt.org/uhhn1#expand
 wiking	my definition
 harshit_	hello everyone :)
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 wiking	blackburn: any ideas?
 wiking	i really couldn't find more pure virtual functions that i'm missing and no other things i would miss... but for sure it's something with my implementation
 blackburn	wiking: what is .cpp?
 wiking	http://snipt.org/uhhp6#expand
 wiking	looool
 wiking	niiice
 wiking	it's most def thinking that it's still an abstract class
 wiking	features/LatentFeatures.cpp:26:13: error: allocating an object of abstract class type 'CLatentFeatures'
 wiking	        return new CLatentFeatures (*this);
 blackburn	wiking: but there is CLatentFeatures(CLatentFeatures) constructor?
 blackburn	where*
 wiking	i haven't defined a copy constructor
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i think i see the problem
 wiking	../shogun/features/Features.h:100:25: note: unimplemented pure virtual method 'get_feature_class' in 'CLatentFeatures'
 wiking	                virtual EFeatureClass get_feature_class()=0;
 wiking	using inline is not good
 blackburn	wiking: ah
 blackburn	don't use inline on virtuals
 blackburn	makes no sense
 blackburn	as calling the virtual function leads to look up in vtable it can't be inlined afaik
 wiking	blackburn: have you tried this: git grep "inline virtual"
 blackburn	wiking: heh you are right

 harshit_	blackburn, : having problems with tsvm, please help !
 wiking	ok this is getting funnier and funnier
 wiking	i still get the same error
 blackburn	wiking: still?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	even though i've moved the thing into .cpp
 wiking	for get_feature_class
 blackburn	harshit_: what is the problem?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i might know what's the problem
 wiking	ahahah yeah
 wiking	so can i have a question?
 wiking	why virtual EFeatureClass get_feature_class()=0; and not virtual EFeatureClass get_feature_class() const=0;
 wiking	?
 harshit_	blackburn: I am submitting correct parameters to ssl.cpp but getting wrong weights as output
-!- xiangwang [~chatzilla@159.226.60.224] has joined #shogun
 wiking	in CFeatures...
 xiangwang	hi wiking
 blackburn	wiking: const? yes this should be fixed
 wiking	xiangwang: heey
 wiking	blackburn: it's not const
 blackburn	wiking: I meant that
 wiking	i naturally assumed it should be a const as it does not change anything in the class..
 blackburn	wiking: yes it should
 wiking	and that was the problem... since really it was a different func
 wiking	ok i'll write up a sed script for fixing this
 blackburn	hmm it seems I have a task for gsomix
 blackburn	gsomix: !
 blackburn	:D

 gsomix	blackburn, hey
 xiangwang	 in SVMLight.h not all the functions of SVMLight realized ?  like svm_learn_optimization?
 harshit_	blackburn: please have a look at the comment I posted on my pull request !
 blackburn	gsomix: you may fix the const issue
 blackburn	i.e. all the methods that should be const should be const
 gsomix	blackburn, ok/
 blackburn	harshit_: checking
 blackburn	harshit_: ok I can't help with some code right now but you may compare our ssl.cpp and the one you assume as ground truth
 harshit_	blackburn: ok no worries :)
 harshit_	blackburn: and yeah I did compare that only .. but the problem was that there were a few functions which where not ported to shogun
 harshit_	so I did that and when now I am comparing the 2 results it is not the same !!!
 blackburn	hmm that's strange
 blackburn	are you sure all the parameters are the same then?
 n4nd0	harshit_: hey! did you compare the results of those funcitons you ported too?
 wiking	?
 wiking	xiangwang: u wanted to msg me?
 blackburn	wiking: ?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	:D
 harshit_	n4nd0: hey ! yeah ,Actually they are only 2 functions for creating subset of labeled features from mix of labeled and unlabeled
 xiangwang	sorry, wrong button:)
 harshit_	that I ported
 harshit_	n4nd0, and I think they are working fine
 wiking	xiangwang: ah ok :)
 wiking	blackburn: ehhehe of course now it compiles... ;)
 n4nd0	harshit_: uhm, any clue where the error can be then?
 xiangwang	i'm trying to realize Latent SVM, but the code is not fully written.
 blackburn	wiking: I kind of delegated this task to gsomix so we will ensure that const is in place
 wiking	blackburn: actually virtual int32_t get_size (); should be the same
 wiking	blackburn: ahhaha :)
 harshit_	n4nd0, somewhere in between ssl.cpp( file where svmlin code for shogun is )
 blackburn	I have to go now guys :) n4nd0 thanks I hope you would help harshit_ ;)
 wiking	xiangwang: which code?
 xiangwang	should this part of code push to the shogun svm for gsoc qualification patch?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will try :)
 n4nd0	harshit_: between ssl.cpp and?
 xiangwang	Intergration of Latent SVM
 xiangwang	to shogun
 harshit_	n4nd0, I meant inside ssl.cpp
 wiking	xiangwang: i think you should be able to do a pull request...
 wiking	with some patch
 harshit_	hey maybe i should test svm of svmlin
 xiangwang	but the code is not fully written...
 n4nd0	harshit_: yeah, sure
 harshit_	that would give me idea whether svmlin is correctly ported or not
* blackburn is looking how one candidate student is asking his competitor how to apply to the task

 harshit_	n4nd0, btw is your covertree done ??
 wiking	blackburn :DDD
 n4nd0	harshit_: it is working and it is faster than what we used to have if the number of queries is more or less large
 n4nd0	harshit_: but it is not yet as fast as the standalone version
 n4nd0	harshit_: they use a computation of distance with quite a bit of speedups, I have still to work on those
 harshit_	n4nd0, oh great , whats standalone version ?
 n4nd0	harshit_: the original version from John Langford
 harshit_	you mean actual implementation
 harshit_	oh okay
 harshit_	great dude :)
 harshit_	Inform me when you'll get this merged, I can test it on my project (I did one project in which I used knn)
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	that could help :)
 n4nd0	what was the number of training vectors?
 n4nd0	how many queries?
 n4nd0	and what dimension?
 n4nd0	lot of questions :))
 harshit_	really huge :) I used subset of 20 Newsgroup dataset
 harshit_	i dont remember exactly but it was about 5000 training vectors and 4000 features/words
 harshit_	That was a stupid project actually, I did that when I was first learning machine learning.
 harshit_	n4nd0, And It used to take 5-6 hrs to get results on matlab ( I used my own implementation of knn)
 n4nd0	harshit_: ok
 n4nd0	harshit_: so feature vectors of dimension equal to 4000? that's a big one
 harshit_	n4nd0, nlp tasks normally have bow representation of documents which make feature dimensions really large
 n4nd0	ok
 harshit_	n4nd0, I dont know if shogun has any support for sparse features ?
 harshit_	do you knw if it has
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	CSparseFeatures
 n4nd0	harshit_: https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/features/SparseFeatures.h
 harshit_	but that doesn't work in octave. right ?
 harshit_	oh thats really good
 n4nd0	I remember I heard something about that the swig typemaps were not ready for that
 n4nd0	gsomix: I think you know something else about that ^, don't you?
 gsomix	n4nd0, mmm, it work in octave now.
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	harshit_: then it looks like it is ready
 n4nd0	gsomix: it was something you did recently?
 gsomix	n4nd0, yep.

 wiking	uricamic: sorry for yesterday... :(
 uricamic	wiking: its ok
 wiking	do u have some time now?
 uricamic	wiking: yes, for now, but soon I will have to talk with my adviser
 xiangwang	thanks wiking, but i can't find my pull now in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pulls
 uricamic	wiking: but he is not here right now, so I have some time :)
 wiking	uricamic: ok so the thing is that instead of simply just adding 2 headers of libqp
 wiking	we should do some c++ wrapping of libqp
 uricamic	wiking: ok
 wiking	just like liblinear/libsvm or svmlight
 wiking	btw the libqp_splx_solver function in shogun case
 wiking	it's copied from libqp?
 wiking	ah yeah it is
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@157.159.42.154] has joined #shogun
 uricamic	wiking: I think that lipqp.h is the header file of libqp_splx.cpp, where is this solver implemented
 wiking	yep
 wiking	i was just wondering
 wiking	whether these are like copied from the libqp
 wiking	and actually it's just copied from libqp into shogun's repo
 wiking	and that's it basically
 uricamic	yep
 wiking	and actually at this moment only libqp_splx_solver is being copied
 wiking	so i guess we should follow the style of shogun, i.e. copy the source from libqp and not 'depend' on it ;)
 wiking	i have objections about this but then again i guess sonney2k and blackburn has their reasons to do this this way...
 wiking	but still we should do a c++ wrapper for both of the functions
 uricamic	by libqp you mean the original library http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~xfrancv/libqp/html/ ?
 wiking	yes
 uricamic	ok
 wiking	i don't know though how often vojtech is planning to do upgrades on libqp ;)
 wiking	from an email of his he seems to be quite busy lately
 wiking	so i guess not too soon
 uricamic	wiking: yes he is, I can ask him
 uricamic	but he is not here right now :)
 wiking	heheh his your advisor?
 wiking	*he's
 uricamic	yep :)
 wiking	ah cool! you are lucky! ;)
 uricamic	:)
 uricamic	but I don't think, that he plans to do some chenges
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so anyhow i'm just checking now where could we fit nicely the whole thing
 wiking	so whether we could fit it into one abstract class
 wiking	or simply just create an own standalone class for it
 wiking	sonney2k: here?
 wiking	afais we should just do a standalone cpp wrapper for it but i need to see what sonney2k thinks about it
 wiking	uricamic: r u going to continue bmrm?
 uricamic	wiking: I hope so
 uricamic	now it is basically in the state, that it also requires a wrapper

 sonne|work	wiking: whats up?
 Marty28	cya
 wiking	sonne|work: it's just a quick question about libqp integration
 sonne|work	wiking: so are uricamic and you intending to do sth about it?
 wiking	sonne|work: yep hoping so
 sonne|work	would be great
 sonne|work	I assume you both need it for your projects anyways...
 uricamic	sonne|work: yep, I will definitely need it
 wiking	i was just wondering if u have any opinion about whether the libqp wrapper should be a standalone class (as afaik there's no abstract class where we could plug this into) or shall we start thinking about making an abstract qp solver class ...? i.e. maybe the latter one would be wiser as i can see there's the QPBSVMLib
 wiking	that i *guess* it's another qp solver
-!- Marina [55b326f1@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.179.38.241] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
 wiking	so maybe having like a QP solver abstract class and doing the various implementations inherited from that would be good to have...
 wiking	uricamic: me too ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: I think it should be similar to what libocas is now - basically a C library we have in shogun and use with all the necessary callbacks to enable sufficient flexibility
 sonne|work	then a wrapper on top
 sonne|work	yes
 abhi1234	hi sonne
 abhi1234	i have a quick question
 abhi1234	if it is a good time to ask
 sonne|work	this way vojtech can continue to maintain this library outside and we only have to adjust the wrapper
 abhi1234	thanks in advance
 sonne|work	abhi1234: ask
 sonne|work	(don't ask to ask)
 abhi1234	ohh
 abhi1234	sorry
 wiking	sonne|work: mmmm
 abhi1234	I am planning to run shogun in visual studio
 abhi1234	is it possible
 abhi1234	i have window 7 and cygwin
 abhi1234	and it is really difficult to compile the modshogun.dll
 abhi1234	in cygwin
 abhi1234	so if it is possible can I get a modshogun.dll for a quick run
 sonne|work	wiking: what does that mean?
 wiking	sonne|work: just thinking loudly ;)
 sonne|work	abhi1234: I am afraid that this is not so easy

 wiking	sonne|work: so let's keep the libqp as it is now (i.e. an easy way to add the future changes), but still aim for not only a nice c++ wrapper on top of the qp solver but start defining an abstract qp solver as well...?
 abhi1234	ohh terrible then
 abhi1234	i am really impressed by the kind of algorithm available in shogun
 abhi1234	you people have done an amazing work
 wiking	abhi1234: maybe u could be the one who does the work ;)
 abhi1234	yeah i would like to be
 wiking	abhi1234: what's your current error?: )
 sonne|work	wiking: that is what I meant - some nice C++ interface to enable using it within shogun and all its interfaces
 sonne|work	wiking: but using libqp internally
 abhi1234	my current error is related to option -pthread
 wiking	sonne|work: ok... and try to do something about QPBSVMLib as well... ;)
 wiking	sonne|work: ooh i think we are on the same page then... i saw blackburn's possible patch to move out to an 'external' directory the external libraries... i totally second that idea
 abhi1234	but cant i get the modshogun.dll from someone  who built it in linux environment only
 wiking	abhi1234: well it's not a dll
 wiking	i can give u a .so
 wiking	but i doubt that it'll work for u
 abhi1234	ohh
 sonne|work	wiking: well if we manage that kind of integration, the files cplex / pr_loqo etc should all be in there too
 sonne|work	and e.g. SVMlight could work with any of the solvers then
 abhi1234	.so i am afraid wont work for me
 wiking	sonne|work: cool
 wiking	i see my competitor did a pull request i should get onto giving a patch today/tomorrow ;P
 wiking	abhi1234: ok so you die with -pthreads
 wiking	u use cygwin i assume
 wiking	abhi1234: have u actually 'made' cygwin to install the pthread library?
 wiking	as it is part of cygwin but you need to tell the installer that u want it
 wiking	if not then try to install it now
 abhi1234	sure
 abhi1234	let me try it
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	can u do this
 wiking	ls -la /usr/lib/libpth*
 abhi1234	one moment
 wiking	and what's the result for it
 wiking	uricamic: u still here or your advisor caught you?
 abhi1234	-rw-r--r-- 1
 wiking	abhi1234: the whole lien ;)
 abhi1234	is the result i get
 uricamic	wiking: still here :)
 wiking	*line
 abhi1234	one moment
 wiking	uricamic: so i think we should then start defining an abstract qp solver class
 uricamic	wiking: yep
 abhi1234	-rw-r--r-- 1 TTG None 30678 Apr  5 20:35 /usr/lib/libpthread.a
 wiking	abhi1234: so u have then actually pthread
 wiking	abhi1234: why don't you pastebin your full error and send it to us
 wiking	i mean compilation error
 abhi1234	sure I will do that
 abhi1234	one moment
 wiking	uricamic: ok i'll sketch up something soon and put it into one branch of mine so that everybody can comment on it via github, but if you have already some ideas please don't be shy ;)
 uricamic	wiking: ok, I will look at it
 abhi1234	earlier when i tried to compile it was throwing error "unrecognized option -pthread"

* sonney2k thinks we should add a norm function to DotFeatures
@sonney2k	n4nd0, would be nice - but first things first

 n4nd0	with unrolled loops and so on
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah
@sonney2k	and screw the (small) speedup that the upper bound to distance gives us

-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.167.125] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I think that JL's code can be twice as fast if he uses d1 ...d4
@sonney2k	then it would really be just two sse instructions
@sonney2k	but I guess we need a separate benmark for that
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yeah that makes actually sense, I thought of it, if they unrolled 2, why not 4? but I thought that maybe it didn't pay off or sth
@sonney2k	maybe when he wrote it it didn't make any difference
@sonney2k	or he wrote it for double
@sonney2k	n4nd0, still I don't understand why you measured that in JL's implementation the thing is *much* fuster
@sonney2k	faster
@sonney2k	(like 10x or so)
 n4nd0	do you think it shouldn't?
@sonney2k	this thing here looks like it can be twice as fast due to the d1,d2 idea and another factor of 2 due to using floats
@sonney2k	so 4x
@sonney2k	but no more
@sonney2k	(if the upper bound doesn't help a lot)
 n4nd0	some overhead in shogun somewhere?
 n4nd0	I will profile this in any case, I find it interesting
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I would start with some simple example just computing the distance matrix for say 1000 vectors once with the shogun and once with the jl code
@sonney2k	I would predict 4 times faster :D
 n4nd0	I write that down, we'll see if your prediction is correct ;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, then you could use the *slow* shogun distance version in Jl's tree and see if speeds are the same
@sonney2k	if not then we have a timesink somewhere :)
-!- PhilTillet [~Philippe@npasserelle10.minet.net] has joined #shogun
 gsomix	it's time to reading the philosophy.
 gsomix	cu, guys
@sonney2k	n4nd0, actually I bet on the time sink - the distance function will only be marginally faster
 gsomix	"Machine Learning Andrew Ng, Associate Professor 23 April 2012" wow, most interesting things are after 23 :)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: where the time sink would be then?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, that is the hard part to find out :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, but if this distance function is soo fast it would speed up the gaussian kernel computation and lots of stuff *a lot*
@sonney2k	n4nd0, which reminds me that we can speed things up anyways by using ||x-y||^2 == x^T x - 2xy + y^Ty
@sonney2k	x^Tx can be precomputed
 n4nd0	sonney2k: would that entail a big difference in general?
@sonney2k	and so we only need dot(x,y)
@sonney2k	that is what we use for gaussian kernel at least for sparse features
@sonney2k	actually for all features
@sonney2k	that certainly is *a lot* faster even than what JL uses
@sonney2k	n4nd0, so yes :D
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I hope you pass exams soon and have some time to investigate
 n4nd0	sonney2k: there was also another speedup suggested in a comment within his code but not implemented
 n4nd0	sonney2k: https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/patch-jlcovertree/src/shogun/lib/JLCoverTree.h
 n4nd0	line 594
@sonney2k	no idea about that (no covertree guru)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I have updated the patch with time functions used from shogun
@sonney2k	then let me merge it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: can you please take it a look and tell me if I have done the git part correctly? I see that this time there are no duplicates commits by me
 n4nd0	but commits from other people appear in the PR :S
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you did it again
@sonney2k	no git pull --rebase
 n4nd0	I did that this time!
@sonney2k	why am I seeing https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/464

@sonney2k	3edd188

@sonney2k	...
 n4nd0	yeah I know but I did it that way this time
@sonney2k	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/464/commits
@sonney2k	n4nd0, can you tell me exactly what you did?
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uhhT8#expand
 n4nd0	that's my history
 n4nd0	grepped to git commands
 n4nd0	let's find out what I am doing wrong, I don't really understand :(
 n4nd0	the experimental stuff is just something I did to try out if I got in that case the non-fast-forward allowed and how I can delete a remote branch
 n4nd0	2058 gave the familiar error about non-fast-forward not allowed
 n4nd0	so then I git pull --rebase
@sonney2k	might be related to 2060  git pull --rebase
@sonney2k	 2061  git pull --rebase origin patch-jlcovertree
@sonney2k	I mean *I* would have git checkout master ; then git pull --rebase
@sonney2k	then git checkout patch-jlcovertree
@sonney2k	git rebase master
@sonney2k	git push origin patch-jlcovertree
 n4nd0	even if the problem is to push in the branch, do I have to pull in my master?
 n4nd0	as you see in 2040, the push in master worked fine
@sonney2k	did you do work inbetween 2040 and 2060?
@sonney2k	anyway I think the problem is the call to git pull --rebase origin patch-jlcovertree
@sonney2k	I think this rebases everything new on top of what is in origin patch-jlcovertree
 n4nd0	between 2040 and 2060 I didn't work
 n4nd0	the whole history is there
@sonney2k	I think you don't ever need to pull from that and if you do not with rebase
 n4nd0	:O
 n4nd0	I thought you told me that last time
 n4nd0	so then, do you have any clue about how should I do it?
@sonney2k	no I said you shoudl do git checkout master; git pull --rebase ; git checkout patch-jlcovertree ; git rebase master ; git push origin patch-jlcovertree
@sonney2k	n4nd0, do you still have the patch lying around isolated?
@sonney2k	or can you follow what is described in git help reset
@sonney2k	and in there 'Undo a merge or pull inside a dirty working tree'
 n4nd0	I can do as I did for this pull request, create a new branch and apply the patches for each of the commits
