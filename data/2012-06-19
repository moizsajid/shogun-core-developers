 blackburn	wiking: you promised to send report ;)
 wiking	sended
 wiking	:)
 wiking	should b there in any seconds
 blackburn	why didn't you do that yesterday? :)
 wiking	hacking too late
 wiking	i've just woken up man
 wiking	 :)
 blackburn	it seems you like to get us worried :D
 wiking	nono i like to work on this project
 wiking	that's why the all-nighters
 wiking	currently trying to work with libqp somehow :S
 blackburn	ok
 wiking	but that's still shit :(
 wiking	n4nd0: have u started on that
 wiking	or u are still working with mosek?
 blackburn	what are you doing this time?
 blackburn	to get you in shape and make some progress we really would like to merge anything
 n4nd0	wiking: libqp doesn't solve the problem I need t osolve
 wiking	blackburn: well i'm trying already the SO implementation + m3e porting (http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v22/miller12/miller12.pdf)
 wiking	n4nd0: how so?
 blackburn	wiking: IIRC you had some simple latent svm before?
 wiking	yeye
 wiking	i should pull it though
 n4nd0	wiking: we need the box constraints case with inequalities
 wiking	so you can start marging true
 wiking	n4nd0: s.t. \sum x_i <= b_k ?
 n4nd0	wiking: check in your mail the pdf that nico sent
 wiking	n4nd0: ok
 n4nd0	wiking: or even better
 n4nd0	http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/
 n4nd0	second weekly report
 wiking	http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s.t.~%5Cforall+i~%5Cforall+y+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BY%7D+%5Csetminus+y_i+%3A+%5Cvec%7Bw%7D+%5Ccdot%5Cdelta%5CPsi_i%28y%29+%5Cge+%5CDelta%28y_i%2C+y%29+-+%5Cxi_i&bg=eeeae8&fg=4a4a49&s=0 ?
 wiking	:D
 wiking	mmm so does this mean that you'll actually stick with mosek for good?
 n4nd0	it looks like there is no open source available for that problem
 n4nd0	the plan is to use mosek now and later, if there's time, do a simple solver for it integrated into shogun
 wiking	mmm
 blackburn	n4nd0: you may try nlopt now btw
 blackburn	no idea if it is any reasonable but at least open source
 wiking	mmm shit then actually
 wiking	because then my stuff with SO will have some problems :(((
 wiking	well anyhow it's not that major atm
 n4nd0	blackburn: I will see if it can be used for this
 n4nd0	blackburn: thank you :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: it can be used I believe but performance would be bad probably
 blackburn	cause it is quite general
 wiking	n4nd0: any plan for a pull request?
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/580
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	so it's pending
 wiking	ok
 wiking	 because now i'm cherry picking your so branch
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	does it give trouble for you that's not yet merged?
 wiking	well currently it's ok
 wiking	just stupid in a way
 n4nd0	?
 wiking	that i'm maintaining 2 dev branches
 wiking	1 for general latent stuff
 wiking	and 1 for SO latent stuff based on your code
 n4nd0	I see
 wiking	since the current SO in the main branch of shogun
 wiking	is 'deprecated' ;)
 wiking	anyhow as soon as it's in i could merge it afaik
 wiking	*afais
 n4nd0	it will be good if you start to use it
 n4nd0	I want to see it in action
 n4nd0	debug more
 n4nd0	etc
 wiking	well i'm already having some fun with it
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	but was hoping
 wiking	you'll be able to use libqp :s

 wiking	n4nd0: u have some time now?
 n4nd0	wiking: yes
 n4nd0	tell me
 wiking	can u check this
 wiking	http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v22/miller12/miller12.pdf
 wiking	algo 2
 wiking	(page 5)
 wiking	so i need a solver for that :)
 n4nd0	haha ok
 n4nd0	I am looking to equation 13
 n4nd0	definetely, it has some similarities with the primal sosvm

 n4nd0	but it is not the same problem
 n4nd0	I am not handling contrainst of type ||w - w_t ||^2 <= \mu
 n4nd0	but I believe it should be possible to do
 n4nd0	the norm is the common Euclidean one right?
 wiking	yeps
 n4nd0	||w - w_t||^2 = < w-w_t, w-w_t >
 n4nd0	?
 n4nd0	the dot product simply
 wiking	since it's a l2-norm
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	so it's not the same that I solve :(
 n4nd0	I am sorry
 n4nd0	you can solve that with mosek though
 wiking	heheh
 n4nd0	http://docs.mosek.com/6.0/capi/node007.html#329747704
 wiking	i know that :)
 n4nd0	look there
 n4nd0	yeah, wait
 n4nd0	for my current problem
 n4nd0	Q^k = 0
 n4nd0	but in your problem is not like that
 n4nd0	do you see my point?
 n4nd0	you have quadratic constraints I think
 n4nd0	while in the primal so-svm those don't appear
 wiking	this is already some extra funky stuff the stuff i'll need with your solver is actually the algo 1 on page 4. afaik that's a simple structural svm (equation 9)
 n4nd0	yes
 wiking	i mean this other one i've mentioned before i'll need as well, but i thought i could go around your SO so that's why i've started that
 n4nd0	that's my problem
 wiking	ok
 wiking	actually
 n4nd0	the second one is a bit different
 wiking	it'll be great now
 wiking	i thought it'll be a problem that the latent SO and the basic latent stuff
 wiking	will have very different implementation
 wiking	but now since you are depending on mosek
 wiking	i think it's even good
 wiking	that they are so 'separate'
 n4nd0	I don't understand what you mean
 n4nd0	what do you mean with separate?
 wiking	well
 wiking	the basic latent svm implementation has nothing to do with your SO
 wiking	obviously
 wiking	but now when i've started to use your SO framework
 wiking	the whole latent SO svm is a complete rewrite of the basic latent implementation
 wiking	there's almost nothing they share in the implementation part
 n4nd0	aham ok
 wiking	so for me it wasn't 'elegant' enough since essentially they are similar
 wiking	so i wanted to have it implemented as one
 wiking	but now with the whole mosek story
 wiking	i even actually like the idea that it's like this
 n4nd0	but is it just mosek what makes them so 'separate'?
 wiking	since if one does not have mosek, he can still have basic latent svm
 wiking	no of course not
 wiking	it's the whole SO
 n4nd0	ok

 n4nd0	wiking: back
 wiking	n4nd0: do u have an example implementation of so?
 wiking	so_multiclass.cpp?
 n4nd0	yes
 wiking	ok so i could use that actually
 n4nd0	what do you want to do?
 wiking	well to have a working example for so latent svm :)
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	mmm
 n4nd0	tell me
 wiking	data :D
 wiking	i'd like to have a meaningful input for the example

 n4nd0	what latent datasets are around there?
-!- alexlovesdata [82955843@gateway/web/freenode/ip.130.149.88.67] has joined #shogun
 wiking	none :D
 n4nd0	haha there must be something c'mon
 n4nd0	btw, it looks like the mailing list has a looong delay or something :P
 blackburn	it must be russian post
 wiking	n4nd0: well there's one i've mentioned already
 wiking	last week
 wiking	but that's a simple latent svm example
 n4nd0	aham ok
 wiking	there's supposedly 2 so svm
 n4nd0	but it could be good to start with something simple and see if the results are ok
 wiking	(to which the author of the paper refers to)
 wiking	but that's not available
 n4nd0	remember that my implementation has not been thoroughly tested yet
 wiking	anywhere... and there's still no answer from the author about the dataset
 wiking	yeah i know that's why i actually want to use it on a dataset so that i could actually compare
 wiking	haaah!
 wiking	bounced!
 alexlovesdata	we can create a latent structured problem easily
 alexlovesdata	using a small part of existing datasets
 alexlovesdata	small enough by trainnig data size so that a generic solver would do it for testing code sanity and interfaces

 wiking	this is what happened
 wiking	:>
 wiking	yes
 wiking	alexlovesdata: how?
 alexlovesdata	can you explain pls what hapneed in detail ;)
 alexlovesdata	happened
 wiking	this is my exim's log
 wiking	alexlovesdata: how would u create the dataset?
 alexlovesdata	what is a exim log?
 wiking	alexlovesdata: exim = my mailserver
 alexlovesdata	ahh, ok that has to do with the email delays ...  I was not interested in that, that is not so important for me
 n4nd0	haha good answer
 alexlovesdata	no going for code is more important for me
 wiking	alexlovesdata: so my problem is that i want to be able to compare our results
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: have you some experience trying out SO for multiclass classification?
 alexlovesdata	no, mostly I work on multilabel problems
 wiking	alexlovesdata: so that's why i wanted to get the at least on of those latent so datasets that chun nam is referring to
 alexlovesdata	there is a paper about SO for multilabel problems by Christoph Lampert NIPS2012
 n4nd0	multilabel is not multiclass right?
 alexlovesdata	right: multi-class = mutually exclusive
 alexlovesdata	multi-label: one image can have many labels at the same time
 alexlovesdata	I have used the code of joachims for multi-class SO
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	struct svm?
 alexlovesdata	but it was (as expected) not better than one-vs-all
 n4nd0	svm struct probably...
 alexlovesdata	yes
 n4nd0	it is because my multiclass so kind of sucks a bit ...
 alexlovesdata	what means sucks?
 n4nd0	the results look bad to me
 n4nd0	I don't know if it is normal or my implementation is messed up
 n4nd0	or both ...
 alexlovesdata	bad compared to what?
 alexlovesdata	for multi-class SO you have to use a higher regconst compared to one vs all
 alexlovesdata	because you \|w\
 n4nd0	one-vs-rest multiclass built with liblinear binary classifiers
 n4nd0	wait a moment there
 alexlovesdata	\|w\|^2 is a sum of sub-ws compared to one vs all
 n4nd0	higher regconst?
 alexlovesdata	yes, the C
 n4nd0	the C in C*sum_i slack_i?
 alexlovesdata	because \|w_{mc}\|^2 = \sum_c \|w_c\|^2
 n4nd0	mmm I don't think I understand what you mean, sorry :S
 alexlovesdata	so as a quick fix: take a good C from 1vsall and multiply it with number of classes
 alexlovesdata	yes the C in the slack sum
 wiking	n4nd0: hahah i have to stop you there :)
 wiking	alexlovesdata: so how to create the data set :)
 wiking	n4nd0: i've taken over the priority for my mentor :> ask the rest later :P
 alexlovesdata	my experience, nando is: struct mc is in the same order as 1 vs all if you set the regcnost well
 alexlovesdata	ok wiking I listen
 wiking	alexlovesdata: dataset for latent so svm
 n4nd0	wiking: all yours ;)
 alexlovesdata	multi-class object detection or multi-label object detection
 wiking	there's the two that chun nam is talking about... but no access to them...
 alexlovesdata	latent variable is position
 wiking	stupid question: how's that structural?
 alexlovesdata	or: take images of object classes with background (pascal VOC) and rotate them ... latent variable would be rotation
 alexlovesdata	or maybe: mosaics of images with structure
 wiking	ok the last one i get  :)
 alexlovesdata	need to demosaic the image (that would be a fun paper for a conference!)
 wiking	but like mult-class object detection
 wiking	how's that structural
 alexlovesdata	it is structural in the same way as struct multi-class is structural
 wiking	ok so your loss function ...
 wiking	ok
 alexlovesdata	or multi-task object detection ...
 alexlovesdata	we can check: http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/papers/lampert-nips2011.pdf
 wiking	n4nd0: actually how's your perf for SO multi class vs svm one-vs-rest ?
 alexlovesdata	whether you can do an object detection version of it
 wiking	n4nd0: i should read the log :)
 wiking	ok multi-label could be fun actually
 wiking	alexlovesdata: but then again then we could actually stick to the dataset i've already have
 wiking	as there i have 6 mammals
 wiking	i.e. multi-class problem
 n4nd0	naywhayare: perf?
 wiking	n4nd0: performance
 alexlovesdata	I have no problem with your mammals
 n4nd0	wiking: I don't like at all
 wiking	alexlovesdata: ok then i guess i need a loss function for that
 alexlovesdata	if they have varying positions in the images
 wiking	yep
 n4nd0	SO-SVM: 38.10%
 n4nd0	MC:     57.70%
 wiking	n4nd0:  :(
 n4nd0	that is using the same data both for training and testing
 n4nd0	10 Gaussians with 100 samples each
 alexlovesdata	for multi-label detection: you can use pascal voc datasets (a small part of it, say 5 object classes where one can expect correlations)
 wiking	n4nd0: hahah i'll try my stuff then
 wiking	n4nd0: meaning my mammals :D
 alexlovesdata	n4ndo: which Cs did you use???
 wiking	alexlovesdata: people + car?
 alexlovesdata	n4ndo: you can try joachims svm multiclass with same parameters to countercheck your results
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: I am using C = number of classes in so
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: C = 1 in the other
 alexlovesdata	for seeing whether the problem sucks or you have a bug in your code
 alexlovesdata	I guess in SO-SVM one class is dominating the predictions
 alexlovesdata	n4ndo: did you check duality gap of your solutions???
 alexlovesdata	a bad duality gap may hint at too early termination
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: I don't know what is the duality gap :S
 alexlovesdata	this might be important to check
 alexlovesdata	duality gap is (primal objective - dual objective)/dual objective
 alexlovesdata	for a convex problem close to the optimum this should be very small
 alexlovesdata	if it is 0.1 or larger your problem is not close to convergence
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	alexlovesdata: so actually then one more question: how would a SOLabel look like
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: how can I compute the primal and udal objectives?
 alexlovesdata	SOLabel for multi-class would be a vector
 alexlovesdata	for multi-label same a vector
 wiking	alexlovesdata: yeah but how would u construct that vector
 alexlovesdata	well i-th entry = i-th class
 n4nd0	wiking: that is already done I think
 n4nd0	wiking: check MulticlassSOLabels
 n4nd0	under structure
 wiking	n4nd0: mmm
 wiking	lesse
 n4nd0	each label is a real number
 wiking	n4nd0: i was checking your example
 alexlovesdata	N4ndo: what is the precise mathemtical formulation of your SO-SVM for multi-class?
 alexlovesdata	can you give a pdf with its formulation?
 alexlovesdata	for a general treatment of duality gap
 alexlovesdata	Boyd Vandenberghe (the book about convex optimization) is a good starting point

 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/second-weekly-report-gsoc-2012/
 n4nd0	I have there a formulation of the optimziation problem
 wiking	n4nd0: so basically you create a SGVector and for i-tth example you set the i-th value of the vector to the given real number (that corresponds to the label)?
 n4nd0	in any case I screwed before
 n4nd0	because the C I was changing is the C in min w'*C*w
 n4nd0	not in C*sum_i slack_i
 n4nd0	wiking: it is not a SGVector
 wiking	n4nd0: i know, but the way to create it...
 alexlovesdata	oops! your C!
 wiking	n4nd0: i was just checking the constructor
 n4nd0	wiking: ok
 alexlovesdata	then you need: C_struct=1/numclasses in that case
 n4nd0	wiking: I mean if you tell me you create an SGVector for the labels, I have to tell you that I don't, because it is not done ;)
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: are both Cs equivalent in that sense?
 alexlovesdata	is C a scalar or a matrix???
 n4nd0	one the inverse of the other?
 n4nd0	matrix
 wiking	n4nd0: no i was just asking how that SGVector in the ctor is interpreted
 alexlovesdata	in one vs all you have w^2 + C/n \sum_i slack_i
 alexlovesdata	why is your C a matrix???
 alexlovesdata	a diagonal one?
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: that matrix is something that Nico wrote in a paper he did for the problem formulation, I have just seen it there
 n4nd0	right now for me it is just the identity matrix
 alexlovesdata	it cannot be a general symmetric matrix!!! then your problem gets degenerated IF C has negative eiogenvalues
 n4nd0	so like if it was not there
 alexlovesdata	can you give me  link to rthe formula of nico? (Alex sighs)
 alexlovesdata	nando: someting is strange about your formulation
 alexlovesdata	if my C is a scalar --- how do you initialize the C matrix in yuor approach - I think this is the mistake

 n4nd0	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/shogun/ideas.pdf
 alexlovesdata	thx nando
 wiking	n4nd0: ok i think i've got it: so in the vector for each sample you set the each class' membership value? so if i have 3 classes and 10 samples then my input vector is 30, right?
 n4nd0	is input vector = weight vector
 n4nd0	=
 n4nd0	?
 wiking	n4nd0: yes for the CMulticlassSOLabels
 alexlovesdata	n4ndo: pls try C= diag(1)* number of samples/number of classes
 alexlovesdata	diag(1) = identity matrix
 wiking	n4nd0: figured this from the example it's in the repo
 n4nd0	wiking: 3 classes with feature dim = 10, gives a weight vector of 30
 n4nd0	not with 10 samples
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: ok, thank you, let me try
 wiking	n4nd0: so_multiclass.cpp line 39->54
 wiking	especially labs vector
 wiking	 :)
 wiking	SGVector< float64_t > labs(NUM_CLASSES*NUM_SAMPLES);
 alexlovesdata	n4ndo: how did you set the C matrix before???
 wiking	n4nd0: and u use this labs vector to construct CMulticlassSOLabels
 wiking	that's why i said that this vector will contain the membership value for each class for each sample
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: see init_opt, at the end, https://github.com/iglesias/shogun/blob/so/src/shogun/structure/MulticlassModel.cpp
 wiking	n4nd0: or I'm flying here with the pink elephants here in my head
 n4nd0	wiking: ???
 wiking	n4nd0: http://www.pascalkolkman.com/delirium/images/image1.jpg
 wiking	n4nd0: i'm trying to figure out what's the sgvector content for CMulticlassSOLabels
 n4nd0	wiking: the labels
 wiking	yes
 n4nd0	wiking: the class labels
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: wow the results have improved!!
 n4nd0	I never got a 40% haha
 wiking	n4nd0: so for example if i 1 one sample and 2 labels then it would look like: 1,0
 wiking	or 1, 0.5
 wiking	i.e. the real values are there something like a membership value for a given class
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: I think something is still wrong though
 alexlovesdata	with which C?
 alexlovesdata	you can compare against svm multiclass of joachims using an equivalent C
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: but joachims' is in the dual
 alexlovesdata	(joachims has the C on the slacks)
 alexlovesdata	no, he has a primal solver, too, I am sure
 alexlovesdata	this is a parameter in svm multiclass
 n4nd0	alexlovesdata: I tried to use the primal but I didn't manage
 n4nd0	wiking: I don't really understand what you mean man
 n4nd0	wiking: we have labeled data
 wiking	n4nd0: :DDDDd
 n4nd0	wiking: the class labels are 0, 1, 2, 3 .....
 wiking	this cannot be that difficult as it is now
 wiking	yes
 n4nd0	wiking: from 0 to num_classes-1
 n4nd0	wiking: that's all
 wiking	so i have 2 labels and 1 sample
 n4nd0	but that is not possible
 wiking	why?
 n4nd0	if you have two samples
 n4nd0	you need two labels
 wiking	???
 wiking	i'm sorry but what? :)
 n4nd0	your training data would be then {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)}
 wiking	i have one fucking example
 n4nd0	I think we need to make a dictionary

 wiking	{(x1, y1}}
 wiking	that's it
 wiking	but my |Y| = 2
 wiking	ok?
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	one training example for two classes??
 wiking	how do you construct that sgvector: 1.0, 0
 n4nd0	you cannot
 wiking	blackburn: doesn'tmatter dummy example
 n4nd0	because there should be at least one training example for every class
 n4nd0	call me crazy if you like ...
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i think i've got it
 wiking	but i don't understand it
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	....
 wiking	so your label vector would actually be something like 0,0,1,1
 wiking	for 2 labels 2 samples
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	I think that what you are saying doesn't make much sense
 wiking	lol :D
 n4nd0	because you want to train a machine to recognize examples
 n4nd0	for a class for which you are not giving any sample
 wiking	{(x1,y1), (x1,y2)}
 wiking	i don't want to do this at all
 wiking	i just want to understand your input vector
 n4nd0	that is what you were saying before
 wiking	i don't want to create this
 n4nd0	I have already told you what the input vector is
 n4nd0	it's exactly the same as the one for labels/MulticlassLabels
 wiking	but i wanted to narrow down the misunderstanding factor to the most stupidest example
 wiking	ok
 wiking	and then i've asked back
 wiking	about those lines
 wiking	in the xample
 wiking	labs[c*NUM_SAMPLES+i] = c;
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	whether that is actually a membership value (that's why it's real variable) or why?
 n4nd0	what's the problem there?
 wiking	but no
 n4nd0	membership value?
 wiking	apparently it's not a membership value of a sample for a class
 n4nd0	what is taht?
 n4nd0	the label?
 wiking	n4nd0: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membership_function_(mathematics)
 wiking	fuzzy?
 wiking	you have a membership value for a given class?
 n4nd0	just tell me what you mean with it
 wiking	i cannot it seems
 wiking	because if you scroll back this conversation
 blackburn	why labs is a matrix?
 wiking	nothing makes sense
 alexlovesdata	sorry I am with a physical student for 30 minutes
 blackburn	wiking: c is the class number
 wiking	blackburn: i've got that
 wiking	so that it's not membership
 n4nd0	labs[c*NUM_SAMPLES+i] = c
 wiking	but this way
 n4nd0	NUM_SAMPLES = number of training examples of each class
 blackburn	one thing I do not understand too is why labs is a matrix?
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is not a matrix
 wiking	n4nd0: it is
 blackburn	ah long vector
 n4nd0	blackburn: I might be indexing it so it looks like that, but it is not
 n4nd0	wiking: void gen_rand_data(SGVector< float64_t > labs, SGMatrix< float64_t > feats)
 wiking	n4nd0: i'm reading that yes
 n4nd0	(SGVector< float64_t > labs
 wiking	yes
 wiking	still
 n4nd0	labs[c*NUM_SAMPLES+i]
 wiking	OMFG
 n4nd0	is just a way to index
 wiking	n4nd0: NUM_SAMPLES = number of training examples of each class
 blackburn	so it has NUM_SAMPLES*NUM_CLASSES length?
 n4nd0	it doesn't make it a matrix
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes
 wiking	n4nd0: ok now i've got it :D
 wiking	i thought you have NUM_SAMPLES
 wiking	in sum
 n4nd0	wiking: dude .... you should read the full example before
 n4nd0	:)
 wiking	n4nd0: i've read it
 wiking	n4nd0: but it's impossible that it wasn't understandable what i was asking
 blackburn	ok I think I got it too
 blackburn	so you use it to simplify that setting
 blackburn	to determine which examples are of some class
 blackburn	right?
 n4nd0	ok so I want to generate distinct data for each class
 blackburn	I didn't read anything from the example but it may be confusing a little
 n4nd0	I loop for each of the classes
 n4nd0	generate a mean and a variance that I will use for that class (data distributed as Gaussian)
 n4nd0	and later I loop again
 wiking	brb

@sonney2k	blackburn, hmmhh why did you merge chris' pull request?
@sonney2k	it will explode sparsevector
@sonney2k	and uses std crap
 blackburn	sonney2k: chris asked me to merge that today - I'll change it later
 blackburn	he needed that for some project
 blackburn	I do not like it too but he asked and I'll change so no worries
 blackburn	ok?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would say we introduce some big overhead sparse vector that can have chris' stuff
@sonney2k	as we discussed
@sonney2k	but this should really not be in shogun until done properly
@sonney2k	blackburn, any news from n4nd0 ?
@sonney2k	can I merge his SO stuff?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I promise I'll remove that just after I get BSc;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: he said results improved
 blackburn	today he played with C and it became better
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't care about correctness (for now) just the framework
@sonney2k	others need it so it is better to have it in main
 blackburn	just merge it then
@sonney2k	k
 wiking	sonney2k: n4nd0 said that it's ok and it works/compiles and the example is running as well
 wiking	(for me)

 wiking	doh what is this build error?!
@sonney2k	wiking, you never know - maybe fernando forgot to use git commit --amend ...
 wiking	mmm
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know what the state of puffin's PR is?
@sonney2k	except for the live user in a git commit :D

 wiking	so it seems it's rather the kernel normalizer related stuff...
@sonney2k	n4nd0 certainly did not touch those
@sonney2k	blackburn, are the kernel normalizers now in kernel/normalizer ?
