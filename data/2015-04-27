@wiking	besser82: here?
@besser82	wiking, sure ^^
@wiking	so i have the chroot running
@wiking	no yum no ps command
@wiking	:)
@wiking	what do i do? :)
@besser82	wiking, dnf makecache && dnf install procps-ng
@wiking	dnf?
@besser82	wiking, yum is history now  :P
@wiking	lol
@wiking	::::::>>>
@wiking	okok didn't know
@wiking	doing it
@besser82	wiking, dnf is the pkg-manager for fc22+  :D
@besser82	much faster depsolving and stuff
@wiking	do u have a magicstring that i need for building shogun on fc22?
@besser82	like cmake -switches?
@wiking	well cmake + gcc + eigen-develop
@wiking	etc etc
@wiking	is there like something dnf build-source shogun :)
@besser82	ahh...  those pkgs are already in place  ;)
@wiking	ah cool
@wiking	so i only need buildbot-slave
@besser82	only thing:  you may need to add `-DATLAS_LAPACK=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so -DATLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so` to cmake-cmd
@besser82	the chroot is basically the same shogun is build on Fedora's Koji
@besser82	but I missed to install ccache  :(
@besser82	dnf install ccache

@wiking	ok
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch='develop 'FC22 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	Something bad happened (see logs)
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'FC22 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build #0 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 shogun-buildbot	build #0 of FC22 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed git]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FC22%20-%20libshogun/builds/0
@wiking	hahah no git
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'FC22 - libshogun'
 shogun-buildbot	build #1 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@besser82	wiking, can you add `-DENABLE_CCACHE=OFF` to cmake on fc22 as well, plz?
@besser82	wiking, ccache is always used when installed, thus double passing through ccache causes real overhead during build
 shogun-buildbot	build #1 of FC22 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FC22%20-%20libshogun/builds/1
