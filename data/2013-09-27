 wiking	 sonney2k ok then it's weird ... as CGradientModelSelection depends on NLOPT
 wiking	sonney2k: but maybe it doesn't have the right version yet... as i needed to edit class_list.cpp.py
 wiking	and i dont know when was that commit
@sonney2k	wiking, ok maybe
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build nightly_default
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, force build --branch=develop nightly_default
@sonney2k	*sigh*
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
@HeikoS	wiking: we want to drop NLOPT soon
@HeikoS	wiking: what was done to the unit-tests? some of them take so long when running make test now?
 wiking	eh?
 wiking	i havent touched utests
@sonney2k	wiking, this one looks good http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/bss_jade.html
 wiking	sonney2k: noup
 wiking	it's not
@sonney2k	wiking, shift reload
 wiking	ok getting there...
 wiking	;P
@HeikoS	wiking: so make test basically takes ages to run the unit tests, make unit-tests doesnt, any ideas why that is?
@sonney2k	hushell, for some reason your FGM still fails :/
@sonney2k	don't know why
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/FGM.html
@sonney2k	data is there
 wiking	HeikoS: ctest -R unit
@sonney2k	hushell, what is this bmrm.p ? and bmrm_stats.p ?
@sonney2k	hushell, ahh how long does training take?
 wiking	sonney2k: it's libbmrm stuff
@sonney2k	anything above 20s will be killed
@sonney2k	that might explain it...
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	that's for sure not enough
@sonney2k	wiking, what is?
@sonney2k	let me put 300s there
 wiking	20s
@sonney2k	more is not accepable
 wiking	why not?
 wiking	it's a noteok
 wiking	notebook note a test script
@sonney2k	wiking, so you want someone to watch how the notebook is constructed for > 5 mins?
 wiking	no
 wiking	but this is generated nightly
 wiking	so who the fuck cares if it takes more than 5 mins
 wiking	if it's compiled once  you dont need no 5 mins to watch it
 wiking	(see generated ipynb and html)
@HeikoS	wiking, sonney2k what about having a seperate test branch for long-term tests=?
 wiking	HeikoS: not maintainable
@HeikoS	some tests just take time to check accuracy or similar
@sonney2k	wiking, we run this nightly!
@HeikoS	so rather shorten them and make sure that things are accurate otherwise?
 wiking	sonney2k: and nightly an extra 5 mins is a lot?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes makes sense - maybe we flag them _slow or so in the filename?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: and run only nightly or so
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, per example!
@sonney2k	think 100 examples
 wiking	sonney2k: and?
@HeikoS	what about having a limit of 5 mins for notebooks?
 wiking	first: i really dont see us having 100 notebooks anywhere in the future
@sonney2k	wiking, > 8 hrs?!?
@sonney2k	wiking, I do
 wiking	second you can easily run those notebooks parallel
@sonney2k	notebooks are fun to do so we will have plenty
 wiking	so with 4 cores it's already just about 2 hours
 wiking	;)
@sonney2k	wiking, not on this machine
@sonney2k	it is weak
@HeikoS	currently we only have a few notebooks
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah but those could be run anywhere
@HeikoS	so 5 mins should be fine right?
@sonney2k	we then need to do this on fatbot and transfer stuff over
 wiking	sonney2k: it's no problem

 wiking	sonney2k: i told you the simple command for transfering dirs with buildbot
 wiking	so really a 5 minutes running time for a notebook shouldn't be a problem
 wiking	we have like max 8 notebooks atm
 wiking	and one of them takes longer than coupld of seconds to run
 wiking	so having 1-2 notebooks that is over 3 minutes
 wiking	is totally ok imho

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: removed notebooks since there will be a more complete one soon
 wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe its just slow
 wiking	HeikoS: used to be faster
@HeikoS	it should be like at least 10 times faster now
@HeikoS	sonney2k: remove the gp notebooks, bye!
 wiking	it doesn't return
@HeikoS	sonney2k: removed

 wiking	now
 wiking	it doesn't fucking return
@HeikoS	wiking: debug/release stuff
 wiking	it's just running forever
@HeikoS	wiking: the unit tests also take *much* longer when running with ctest
@HeikoS	compare make unit-tests to make test times
 wiking	HeikoS: ?!
 wiking	whaaat?
 wiking	ah man
 shogun-buildbot	build #537 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/537
 shogun-buildbot	build #538 forced
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
 wiking	of course it does
 wiking	becuase it's completely differnet setup
@HeikoS	well ok
 wiking	shouldn't compare the two
 wiking	when u do make unit-test
 wiking	it basically runs ./tests/unit/shogun-unit-test
 wiking	but if u run ctest -R unit
 wiking	that'll run
 wiking	./tests/unit/shogun-unit-test --gtest_filter=SOMETHING.*
 wiking	and it'll run that as many <SOMETHING>s are
 wiking	this way you get a better idea which unit test actually failed + ctest invoked valgrind is more understandable as well
@HeikoS	wiking: I see, thanks for the explanation
 wiking	but this shit is oooold
 wiking	at least a week old :P
@HeikoS	hehe, I am in holidays ;)
@HeikoS	currently writing the GP notebook, quite fun
@HeikoS	to create these notebooks
@HeikoS	see what one can do with shogun

 wiking	HeikoS: yeah totally
 wiking	HeikoS: i'm free ;) get a sponsor :P
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean imagine how many cool things we could do ;)
 wiking	yeah i know
@HeikoS	wiking: the thing is it is quite some work to make this happen
@HeikoS	so its only intersting if we really want that
@HeikoS	interesting
@HeikoS	need some stuff to show
 wiking	i mean after the release i hope i can start again doing some more interesting stuff and not this tidious pre-release cleanup shit
@HeikoS	otherwise no-one will bother
@HeikoS	wiking: I think the clean up stuff is quite important
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but it's really getting on my nerves
@HeikoS	understanable
 wiking	i'm excited about 3.0 so i'm pushing it
@HeikoS	man
@HeikoS	understandable
 wiking	but i hope that i can shift my commits to more interesting stuff ;P
 wiking	oh btw
@HeikoS	I am really excited about making shogun more accessible
 wiking	i need to run something on a cluster
@HeikoS	ah cool
 wiking	i'll try your stuff
 wiking	but i think i'll have to write an opensource backend
 wiking	if this works out
 wiking	then we have another very complex example for latent svm
 wiking	;)
 wiking	latentSOSVM
 wiking	but that is certainly not an ipython notebook demo :P
 wiking	as it really takes like a day to train the model :P
@HeikoS	oh wow
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah let me know whether this independent computation thing works for you
@HeikoS	wiking: for me it does it job nicely
 wiking	HeikoS: we'll see
@HeikoS	wiking: but I heavily use pickle
 wiking	HeikoS: i'm wondering about sponsors though
@HeikoS	and I did some nastly hacks
 wiking	HeikoS: i rather imagine we start doing ML consulting :P
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah thats one thing i also had in mind
@HeikoS	wiking: open-source ML software + how-to use it properly

 wiking	roughly

 sonne|work	hushell: what kind of machine did you use
 sonne|work	wiking: that is a lot!

 hushell	it's acceptable in my laptop, how long it takes on buildbots?
 sonne|work	no idea
 sonne|work	hushell: we had a time limit of 20s
 sonne|work	hushell: now 300s
 sonne|work	but likely not sufficient
 wiking	bbl
 hushell	sonne|work: the new version takes longer :/
 wiking	hushell: ?
 wiking	hushell: you mean the integration test?
 wiking	hushell: as there has been no change in SOSVM and stuff..
 hushell	because now I am using two solvers, so double training time
 wiking	ah you mean SOSGD?
 sonne|work	hushell: in the same notebook?
 wiking	hushell: have u tested NCBM for CDualLibQPBMSOSVM
 wiking	?
 hushell	wiking: yeah, integration tests are slow, I run it for 1 hour, but only finished 100 tests
 wiking	hushell: ignore integration tests
 wiking	hushell: they just got partially fixed yesterday
 wiking	hushell: and there's still one integration test that basically goes into infinte loop

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #1683 from lambday/develop
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 wiking	so ignore that for now
 hushell	yeah, I compared bmrm with sgd
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: reduced size and accuracy for speeding up unit-tests
 wiking	hushell: no
 wiking	hushell: CDualLibQPBMSOSVM with NCBM
 hushell	ncbm is better than bmrm?
 wiking	hushell: so when u construct CDualLibQPBMSOSVM
 sonne|work	hushell: so which one wins?
 wiking	then before doing anything
 hushell	SGD is winning, http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6579472
 wiking	hushell: CDualLibQPBMSOSVM.set_solver(NCBM)
 wiking	please try to run this way once
 hushell	wiking: I haven't tested all of them, I see there are a couple of solvers
 hushell	wiking: so which one is best in your experience?
 wiking	hushell: ncbm is very different from the others
 wiking	hushell: you could try P3BMRM but you need parameter tuning there..
 hushell	wiking: okay, this seems necessary
 wiking	hushell: but P3BMRM with right parameters usually is heaps better than simple BMRM
 wiking	hushell: but just test NCBM with the same params
 wiking	just use NCBM as solver...
 wiking	i'm really curious about it's performance
 sonne|work	hushell: interesting - would not have expected that. I guess your iterations are rather cheap but not the optimization steps
 hushell	wiking: I could run all of them and see what happened :)
 hushell	I read the BMRM paper, only few differences in fact, but the NCBM seems quite different
 hushell	sonne|work: yeah, SGD update w for each example, the cutting plane based methods have to reoptimize with all previous constraints, but which better, is a question
-!- gsomix is now known as gsomix|classes
 sonne|work	hushell: I would have expected that the number of iterations of BMRM is *much* less
 sonne|work	hushell: with optimization time being higher
 hushell	sonne|work: I didn't understand the convergence analysis part thoroughly, you will be interested in Table 1 of this paper : http://www.pletscher.org/papers/lacostejulien2013fwstruct.pdf
 sonne|work	hushell: too bad we don't have this one ... it seems even much faster
 sonne|work	bcfw-wavg

 sonne|work	lisitsyn: as usual I am utterly confused about time zones and what this is about?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: a) I set it to berlin but it should be shown b) it is dev meeting
 lisitsyn	b) cont'd - about release mainly
 sonne|work	HeikoS: well we need to be a e.V. to get money and for sure not from M$ - we are OSS and not MSS
 besser82	sonne|work: you need $ for what?  Maybe I can help....
 sonne|work	besser82: no idea - the others are talking about $
 sonne|work	so fear gsoc money helped very much with paying rent for the servers though
 besser82	sonne|work: if it's about servers I can helpout with f-i  :D
 besser82	sonne|work: And who was talking about $? can't find any in history  :(
 sonne|work	besser82: heh well developers is what we need most imho though
 sonne|work	one cannot have too many I would say
 besser82	sonne|work: that's true  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: but if it's about servers / appliances and such, I can get some for you paid by redhat ;)
 sonne|work	besser82: well I would feel more comfortable to run the demos / ipython notebook vms on a different machine than the buildbot / webserver
 sonne|work	but IMHO doing it on the buildbot aka fatbot is sufficient (for now)
 besser82	sonne|work: that's what HeikoS said as well ;)   For this I'm already in talks with Kevin Fenzi (f-i master mind) to setup a cloud-appliance for you ;)
 sonne|work	for all the rest the only thing I can imagine we need money for is to meet 1-2 times a year
 besser82	sonne|work: I can look if I could do sth. there  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: Like a workshop on Flock e.g.
 besser82	sonne|work: Flock visit is paid by redhat fully  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: So we I can arrange to get some room / time for ml-stuff centered around SHOGUN on those events

@sonney2k	wiking, you forgot the reconfig the bot
@sonney2k	config itself is OK!
@sonney2k	van51, it is too big indeed
@sonney2k	van51, you need to use 'linadd' which is only available with svmlight
 wiking	sonney2k: ?
@sonney2k	wiking, make reconfig
 wiking	sonney2k: why?
 wiking	what did i change last tim?
@sonney2k	wiking, now the configure did add the right install path
@sonney2k	wiking, the path but forgot to reconfig
 van51	sonney2k: ok, w/ or w/o on-the-fly preprocessing?
@sonney2k	van51, you have to use the CommUlongStringKenrel and the SortU* preprocessor
@sonney2k	and yes apply() before training
 van51	sonney2k: yeah. I am using those
 wiking	sonney2k: i would say lets provide notebook cloud, but with some kind fo a registartion method
 wiking	sonney2k: let's say oauth2 and then u can login with facebook/googleacc/twitter?
 wiking	ok?
@sonney2k	wiking, no idea what you are talking about...
 wiking	sonney2k: notebook server
@sonney2k	wiking, I am trying to get the .html generated and on the website
 van51	sonney2k: thanks. I'll try again in a while
@sonney2k	wiking, ahh ok sure why not
 wiking	sonney2k: and this way everybody has it's own home etc....
@sonney2k	van51, could you please try with a very small data set?
 wiking	and about sharing atm i really dont care :P
@sonney2k	wiking, and where is this run?
 wiking	sonney2k: fatbot
 wiking	for the moment
 van51	sonney2k: ok. give me a moment
 wiking	no better place
 wiking	if somebody gives us $$$ we move it to amazon ec2
 wiking	i can cut off the CPU time
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah well maybe besser82 can help out. if you intend to do it this big it might actually become popular
 wiking	+ memory
 wiking	and if somebody wants to have something extra
 wiking	then we'll think about how to fix
@sonney2k	van51, please post the code somewhere for me to look at
 wiking	afaik this will not be big for the first couple of months
 wiking	so we are on the save side ;P
 van51	sonney2k: let me convert it to use svmlight
@sonney2k	wiking, well it depends a lot on timing
 wiking	and in the meanwhile we'll try to find a way how we can get some sponsors for hosting this somewhere else
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: what's about me?
@sonney2k	wiking, look when I do a blog post it will be on planet.debian.org which is read by *many* people
@sonney2k	wiking, if we have the workshop videos on youtube
 wiking	sonney2k: we'll have it no worries
 wiking	(videos)
 wiking	besser82: hosting ipython server :P
@sonney2k	wiking, and google also blogs about our gsoc experience
@sonney2k	and it is announced on G+ machine learning/big data etc etc
 wiking	besser82: probably we are going to have problems with resources
@sonney2k	it surely will get plenty of hits
 besser82	wiking: I have already talked with HeikoS about that, I'm going to get some cloud appliance for it....
 wiking	sonney2k: i'll throttle it :P
@sonney2k	we are not weka but what we have with the notbooks etc it is cool
@sonney2k	if we appear in some newsletter at some point (like linux magazin last time)
 besser82	wiking: Or possibly a few more  ;)
@sonney2k	or somebody writes a short ML intro
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah true
@sonney2k	for example for heise / CT
 wiking	but this is what we can do now
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  You want publicity?
 wiking	we dont have money
@sonney2k	our server will be dead
 wiking	-> no cloud
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  How about Heise and linux magazine  ;)
 van51	sonney2k: https://gist.github.com/van51/6732567
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  Have some connections there  ;)
 wiking	if somebody gives me an access to a cloud where we pay after resource
@sonney2k	besser82, well we try to make 3.0 to be a hgiht quality sexy and cool
@sonney2k	so this would be the time to do sth about it
 wiking	then we can rebill that for the users as well
 wiking	but then again
@sonney2k	besser82, exactly heise / linux magazin would be the right people
 wiking	it should be free for small demos
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k:  And I know Thorsten Lemhuis  and Michael Schwendt  ;)
 wiking	otherwise ppl will not use it
@sonney2k	besser82, somebody already wrote already about shogun in linux magazin for our (crappy) 2.1 release
 wiking	2.1 was coooooool
 wiking	:D
@sonney2k	3.0 is really eyecandy if we can get it right
 wiking	so i'll do this shit and setup some shaping
@sonney2k	but it is a lot of work
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: I can arrange sth. short before relase  ;)
 wiking	besser82: when?
@sonney2k	that is my only concern
 wiking	besser82: or what?
 wiking	:)
@sonney2k	no idea we can live up to the standards we want to have
 wiking	sonney2k: well we are getting there now
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: Publicity in iX and Linux Magazine
 wiking	besser82: we need cloud :)
 besser82	wiking: that, too
 wiking	ok but when?
@sonney2k	besser82, yeah that would be thousands of readers
 wiking	i mean i know that i shouldn't be anxious like this
@sonney2k	besser82, and I am afraid of heise DDOS
 wiking	but still i need to prepare shit for this notebook
 wiking	server
 besser82	wiking: I'm currently dealing with f-i people to get some cloud-appliances
 wiking	sonney2k: do we have $$?
@sonney2k	wiking, ok I will hack sth together for the website
 wiking	sonney2k: you mean ref to the notebooks?
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: Heise DDOS?
@sonney2k	wiking, a bit yes
 wiking	sonney2k: can we buy an ec2?
@sonney2k	wiking, we get $500 per student
 wiking	or anything that is similar
 wiking	?
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: you don't need ec2
@sonney2k	besser82, :)
 wiking	besser82: ok anything is cool for me
 wiking	sonney2k: i'm fine by sponsoring a little bit of my own money
 besser82	wiking, sonney2k: I'll give you c-as, just needs some days ;)
 wiking	just to get this started asap
@sonney2k	I have some contacts into amazon I could ask them ...
 wiking	i mean anyhow this would be on demand shit
@sonney2k	besser82, never heard of heise DDoS attacks tacking down everything?
 wiking	so there's no real fee if it's not used
 besser82	sonney2k: not yet :)
 wiking	besser82: is it possible to buy cloud service where u want to get some sponsored access for us?
@sonney2k	besser82, any project website mentioned in 'heise newsticker' was usually not reachable directly afterwards
 wiking	besser82: as maybe the easiest way is that i signup/pay now a little bit to start up with the setup/tests and then later we might get a 'discount' or something
 besser82	wiking: fedora-infra is completely free  ;)
 besser82	wiking: just needs a few days...
 besser82	wiking: ~ middle of next week  ;)
 besser82	wiking: I can arrange ~3 c-a
 besser82	wiking: and is hosted on own servers  ;)
 wiking	besser82: yeah i get that
 wiking	i'm just concernt about the timeframe
 wiking	but no worries i have other bugs to fix
 wiking	so i'll wait another 3 days
 wiking	maybe i'll check till then how to this oauth based ipython notebook server shit

@sonney2k	lambday, yes there is a time limit
@sonney2k	but I we can change it
 lambday	sonney2k: what is it? my notebook takes quite a lot of time
@sonney2k	looks like hushell yours and fernandos notebook require too much time
@sonney2k	lambday, how much?
 lambday	sonney2k: have huge data... although reduced many things but still in my machine it takes around 20+ mins
@sonney2k	lambday, we run this stuff nightly and there is a 1200s timeout with no output
@sonney2k	lambday, your machine is core i7 right?
 lambday	sonney2k: that's bad for my notebook :(
 lambday	sonney2k: yep
@sonney2k	lambday, IMHO this is too big
@sonney2k	lambday, can you reduce it a little?
 lambday	sonney2k: if I try to reduce it, we'll have many warning messages in the html itself...
@sonney2k	lambday, why?
 lambday	sonney2k: yeah me and heiko discussed a few things - first I am trying to steal your pthreaded sparse-matrix * vector code :D and use that whenever we have HAVE_PTHREAD defined
 lambday	as per our experience from the benchmark goes this would help quite a lot
 lambday	sonney2k: if this too doesn't help much... then we'll try reducing the iterations in the iterative solvers that we use... (which in turn prints warning Did not converge!)
@sonney2k	lambday, but can't you reduce the data set or so?
 lambday	sonney2k: but another problem is also there... we compute direct log-det using CStatistics::log_det method which is, as expected, the monster
@sonney2k	lambday, I mean use a subset of dims/examples
 lambday	sonney2k: I can... in fact I can remove a whole dataset
@sonney2k	lambday, maybe it even runs out of memory on this poor machine
@sonney2k	it is not even corei7 yet
@sonney2k	some old core2 duo
 lambday	sonney2k: how much memory do we have in 7nn?
 shogun-buildbot	build #38 of clang34 - undefined behaviour analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20undefined%20behaviour%20analysis/builds/38  blamelist: Roman Votyakov <votjakovr@gmail.com>
 lambday	oh
@sonney2k	quadcore at least
 lambday	sonney2k: I will surely reduce that... in fact my notebook is huge!!
* sonney2k reruns notebook generation
@sonney2k	lambday, how much memory does it need?
 lambday	sonney2k: I can cut down a lot of things which I mainly used to show the power of our method on a really large dataset
 lambday	sonney2k: errr... didn't notice!
@sonney2k	lambday, I would do it this way: write some constants at the beginning of the notebook indicating that you just take a subset and give a comment that this can be 1000 times bigger
 lambday	sonney2k: for direct log_det computation, it creates a cholesky factor with almost 150 mil entriesz
 lambday	]nnz entries that it
@sonney2k	lambday, this machine here has only 4gb
 lambday	sonney2k: :'(
@sonney2k	lambday, for the buildbot, webserver, git etc etc
 lambday	sonney2k: I gotta remove the first large matrix completely!!
 lambday	later parts are still affordable
@sonney2k	I guess that is why it fails
@sonney2k	but as I said keep the code but take subsets and indicate that this is just limited to be quicker for a demo
@sonney2k	whatever fernando's demo is doing it really eats CPU
@sonney2k	3 cpus busy
 lambday	sonney2k: I can comment out the CStatistics::log_det part (which is the main culprit) and say that for demo we have commented this out, and if you run this you'll get this value
 lambday	sonney2k: will try to do these things over this weekend
@sonney2k	lambday, ok maybe show it heiko then :)
@sonney2k	van51, I just read your code
@sonney2k	van51, sorry that it took so long
 lambday	sonney2k: yeah.. he suggested that I redeuce the time to 10 mins max
 lambday	sonney2k: oh and do you think using const SGVector<float64_t>& vec=foo() instead of SGVector<float64_t> vec=foo() would help much??
@sonney2k	van51, please use conv_feats->obtain_from_char(s_feats, 7-1, 7, 0, false);
 shogun-buildbot	build #542 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/542
 lambday	sonney2k: the second just increases the refcount, right?
 lambday	so not much costly.. even when passing as params
 lambday	using reference won't speed up a lot I guess
@sonney2k	van51, apart from that the code looks good. Does it work on a small data set?
@sonney2k	lambday, how often do you do the SGVector operation?
@sonney2k	lambday, what it does is increase the refcount
@sonney2k	this is done in a thread safe manner
 lambday	sonney2k: very very often
@sonney2k	the rest is just copy of pointer and length
@sonney2k	lambday, very very as in ?
@sonney2k	1e6 ?
@sonney2k	1e9 ?
 lambday	sonney2k: let me see.. 1000 iterations default, ~30 times... say 30k for one estimate
 lambday	sonney2k: at some ocassions, we do it 50000 iterations, ~30 times...
 lambday	anyway its just three added operations, won't cost much
 lambday	passing around SGVector is done in a lot of places I guess
@sonney2k	give me a single number please
 lambday	I didn't use reference, just simple SGVector
 shogun-buildbot	build #41 of clang34 - thread analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/41  blamelist: Roman Votyakov <votjakovr@gmail.com>
 lambday	sonney2k: 30k to 5mil
@sonney2k	5e6 only?
 lambday	yeah
@sonney2k	then this is nothing
@sonney2k	maybe 100ms
@sonney2k	that is not the bottleneck
@sonney2k	you must be doing sth more expensive elsewhere
 lambday	sonney2k: alright.. yeah bottleneck is SGSparseMatrix*SGVector, which *has to be done* in pthreaded way whenever we can
 lambday	sonney2k: I will add that code soon
@sonney2k	lambday, so this is the part that is done 5e6 times too right?
 lambday	sonney2k: yep
@sonney2k	wiking, I think LMNN is not converging in this example
@sonney2k	wiking, it is verry slow
@sonney2k	did eat > 1 hour cpu time before being killed
 lambday	sonney2k: could you please let me know how much mine takes on that machine??
@sonney2k	lambday, I will create some script that measures the time
 lambday	sonney2k: that would help a lot on which portions should I comment out.. thanks :)
 van51	sonney2k: hey, sorry I was eating
 van51	sonney2k: I used it on 500 examples and it seg'faulted: https://gist.github.com/van51/6733523
@sonney2k	van51, :(
@sonney2k	we have no tests for anything for that old code
@sonney2k	van51, it could be a big in SVMlight introduced due to some refactoring
@sonney2k	or the kernel
 van51	sonney2k: I can look into the kernel
@sonney2k	van51, please compile again in Debug mode and then get a valgrind trace
@sonney2k	this is currently not very helpful
 van51	sonney2k: ok, when I update it I will ping you
@sonney2k	van51, regarding testing the kernel:
@sonney2k	van51, you could just compute the kernel matrix
@sonney2k	van51, and compare it to what you get with the hashed thing
@sonney2k	van51, it is the same as if you used 7-grams
@sonney2k	van51, in your hashedngramdocfeatures
 van51	sonney2k: I think we had compared it kernel-wise
@sonney2k	van51, if you can please do this in a test
 van51	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	van51, hmmhh well the the add_to_normal call in the kernel is exactly what add_to_dense vec is doing
@sonney2k	normal vector == the dense vector
@sonney2k	so you could test that too if it is that
@sonney2k	if it is svmlight I guess I have to figure out what it is :`-(
 van51	sonney2k: haha, don't get sad before we get to that
 votjakovr	lambday: could you please help me to reproduce the error? i've configured latest develop branch with cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug and then run make and then ctest and it doesn't report this error
 lambday	votjakovr: weird.. I did the same and it gave this error... wait I am trying again
@sonney2k	FGMs also time out
@sonney2k	alright so final evaluation emails are out
@sonney2k	congrats to everyone who passed
@sonney2k	(actually all of you :P )
 lambday	sonney2k: yayyyy :D
 lambday	sonney2k: can I ask shogun buildbot to dance? :D
@sonney2k	lambday, sure do it :)
 lambday	shogun-buildbot: dance
 shogun-buildbot	<(^.^<)
 shogun-buildbot	<(^.^)>
 shogun-buildbot	(>^.^)>
 shogun-buildbot	(7^.^)7
 shogun-buildbot	(>^.^<)
 lambday	hahaha :D
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	van51, keep me updated - I will be off now but read the logs
* sonney2k off
 van51	sonney2k: ok, I just updated the valgrind output btw
 van51	sonney2k: https://gist.github.com/van51/6733523
@sonney2k	van51, at least you see the real location now
 van51	sonney2k: yeah, I will look into it :)
@sonney2k	thanks
@sonney2k	ok now for real
* sonney2k Zzzzz..
 lambday	votjakovr: I just did this again and it still gives the error... might be something wrong
 votjakovr	lambday: hmm... ok, i'll try to find the bug
 lambday	votjakovr: I did rebase this morning.. forgot to rebase this time... may be something you fixed in your PR this morning.. I am trying.. will let you know
