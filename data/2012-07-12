 audy	Hi. Where is the source for ruby_modular?
 blackburn	audy: what kind of source you are interested in?
 audy	blackburn Ruby Modular for Shogun
 blackburn	audy: well, are you interested in typemaps or what?
 audy	blackburn I want to use it to do some machine learning
 audy	or at least see how mature it is
 blackburn	audy: shogun/src contains C++ sources, interfaces/modular contains includes of C++ objects and interfaces/ruby_modular contains typemaps
 audy	blackburn ohh
 blackburn	audy: we use SWIG so all one need to support ruby or anything else - is to set up some typemaps
 audy	blackburn typemaps map ruby objects to C++ types?
 blackburn	no, just some parameters - vectors, matrices and lists of strings
 blackburn	C++ objects are mapped by swig automatically

 puffin444	Hey heiko, I have a question. Is weighted degree RBF Kernel essentially a Gaussian ARD kernel?
 heiko	hey puffin444
 heiko	no idea :)
 heiko	have a look on compute
 heiko	method
 heiko	ah there is something mentioned about amino acids
 heiko	so I guess not
 heiko	also seems to do something else when you look at compute()
 heiko	The ARD kernel would just compute a univariate Gaussian kernel in each dimension right?
 heiko	so that would look different

 CIA-18	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * r5256b36 / (7 files in 4 dirs): Merge pull request #641 from karlnapf/master (+7 more commits...) - http://git.io/zw_Rwg
 gsomix	sonney2k, yay
 gsomix	sonney2k, buffer protocol works for RealFeatures. I need some time for other types.
@sonney2k	gsomix, great job!
@sonney2k	do a PR with that already and then continue with the others I would say...
 audy	blackburn I'm getting "Error: ruby NArray header files missing" when I compile shogun with ruby_modular. Do you know how to still these
 blackburn	audy: you need header files of ruby narray stuff
 blackburn	audy: what is os you do use?
@sonney2k	audy, you need to install ruby-narray  (if you have debian)
 audy	os x
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know what to install under osx?
 audy	I think I just need to do export RUBYLIB=/path/to/narraydir
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, is there a way of just creating the doxygen?
 blackburn	heiko: didn't ever try that
 blackburn	ah wait I did
 blackburn	heiko: did you try run make in doc folder?
 heiko	yep works, thanks!
@sonney2k	audy, ahh and btw if sth doesn't work when you finally have things working - let us know (e.g. file a bug in github issues or mailinglist or here)
 audy	sonney2k sure
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. sent PR, just WIP.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh ok so nothing that would work?
 gsomix	sonney2k, mmm? what do you mean?
@sonney2k	gsomix, you call it WIP
@sonney2k	it looks pretty ok I think - this will only support python3 right?
 gsomix	sonney2k, and python >2.6
 gsomix	it works
 gsomix	really :)
