 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what? :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: football!
@iglesiasg	confederations cup
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ahh
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: you are in convenient conditions with sweden for hockey and spain for football :D
@iglesiasg	I am a smart guy :P
@iglesiasg	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013_program
@iglesiasg	I updated the workshop program btw ^
 lisitsyn	gut iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	tack lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ack
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	hehe
 lisitsyn	shall we speak strange short words?
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	n
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I added some things to my formatting stuff
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: nice, let me see
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: now supports hex, oct and raw pointers
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: https://github.com/lisitsyn/formatting/blob/master/test/wrappers.cc
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: now if you really want pointer one may use formatting::raw(pointer)
 lisitsyn	if one*
 lisitsyn	:)
@iglesiasg	reinterpret_cast wow
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: the only way to cast int to pointer
 lisitsyn	that's just for test
 lisitsyn	in usual case one hasn't to do that :)
@iglesiasg	but one thing
@iglesiasg	about hexadecimal and oct
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yes?
@iglesiasg	mmm so how would it actually work with variables
@iglesiasg	I mean what type of variables would you give to oct() or hex()
@iglesiasg	an integer in decimal?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well actually any it just sets a flag
 lisitsyn	I didn't put any restriction to type yet
@iglesiasg	so say I do
 lisitsyn	<< std::hex << value;
@iglesiasg	oct(8)
@iglesiasg	that prints 10
 lisitsyn	yes
@iglesiasg	ok :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I never used octal though
 lisitsyn	did you?
 lisitsyn	absolutely no idea what is it for :D
@iglesiasg	to change permissions haha
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I am now thinking about precision
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: how do you like precision[3](3.1415)?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: I like it
 lisitsyn	let me put it this way then
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: can you imagine better name?
 lisitsyn	precised[3]
 lisitsyn	precision[3]
@iglesiasg	let me think
@iglesiasg	no, not precised
@iglesiasg	precision much better
@iglesiasg	the only but is may look a bit verbose
@iglesiasg	other than that, jag gillar det
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what is jag gillar det? :)
@iglesiasg	I like it :)
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I actually have a feeling such things are rather rarely used
@iglesiasg	I normally use the precision when I print floats
@iglesiasg	the precision and the padding
@iglesiasg	I like to have the numbers well aligned :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: argh now I think it should be here too
@iglesiasg	ooops sorry
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: this is less trivial as adds combinations
@iglesiasg	or more fun!

 hushell	Does anybody knows the SWIG csharp interfaces?
 hushell	I got an error when generating this function:
 hushell	SWIGEXPORT void SWIGSTDCALL CSharp_StructuredModel_init_primal_opt(void * jarg1, double jarg2, void * jarg3, int size, double* jarg4, int rows, int   cols, double* jarg5, void * jarg6, int size, double* jarg7, int size, double* jarg8, void * jarg9)
 hushell	which gives me multiple int size
 sonne|work	hushell: yeah it is an annoying issue with our swig typemaps occurring whenever you have e.g. two SGVectors as argument
 sonne|work	hushell: the workaround solution is to not expose the function in csharp by putting it in modular/*ignores*.i

 hushell	Are there such tricks for other modulars?
 sonne|work	no
 van51	sonne|work: hello
 van51	sonne|work: I got a question while making the changes
 sonne|work	van51: shoot!
 van51	sonne|work: while the SGVector is limited by the dim size, the dynamic array is limited by the number of tokens
 van51	sonne|work: and isn't more probable to have a larger number of tokens than dim size?
 van51	sonne|work: because the dim size is already supposed to be << than the original feature space dimension
 sonne|work	van51: usually dim is huge
 sonne|work	as in you want 4 grams
 van51	sonne|work: I get that originally dim would be huge, I just thought that the reduced dimension would be reasonable
 sonne|work	van51: IIRC the yahoo spam detector uses 32 bit for hash size
 sonne|work	but you are right
 sonne|work	it depends on what you want to process
 sonne|work	it would make sense to have 2 implementations - one for small dim
 sonne|work	and one for large dim >> document size
-!- nube [~rho@116.90.239.3] has joined #shogun
 van51	sonne|work: maybe if I worked with a map, instead of a dynamic array?
 van51	sonney2k: although I'm guessing it would be rather slower
 sonne|work	it doesn't really matter *that* much for a converter btw
 sonne|work	the heavy part is the training later
 sonne|work	since you currently can assume everything fits in memory the large dim solution would just be fine

 sonne|work	HeikoS: I think you did it last year too
 sonne|work	HeikoS: do you know your Vendor ID Number
 sonne|work	all the rest is totally clear
 sonne|work	ans simple
@HeikoS	vendor id, no idea
 sonne|work	HeikoS: did we get one last year?
@HeikoS	Exact Name Used for Your Mentoring Organization's Supplier Enrollment  ?
 sonne|work	I think you registerd as supplier
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	let me search
 sonne|work	well from http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2013
 sonne|work	Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox
@HeikoS	no thats a different one
 sonne|work	HeikoS: but have a look at Exact Name Used for Your Mentoring Organization's Supplier Enrollment
 sonne|work	oh yes
 sonne|work	misread
 sonne|work	what did you use last time?
@HeikoS	just found a mail with that
* sonne|work too
@HeikoS	is this the supplier enrollment form?
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	you are a supplier already
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I changed my bank, no idea whether thats a problem
 sonne|work	yes it is
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so you have to do the supplier enrollment form again
@HeikoS	yep, searching
 sonne|work	HeikoS: *sigh*
@HeikoS	the supplier form doesn not contain bank data
@HeikoS	just found it
 sonne|work	Supplier resources can be found on our Supplier portal, including a
 sonne|work	tool that lets you check your invoice status!
 sonne|work	https://services.google.com/supplier-enrollment/
 sonne|work	HeikoS: you can go there and click
 sonne|work	I have previously enrolled as a Google supplier and am updating that information
 sonne|work	HeikoS: I guess then you can also immediately fill out the other form
 sonne|work	van51: weird then
@HeikoS	the other?
@HeikoS	you mean the PO one?
 sonne|work	this one Request for Google Summer of Code 2013 Mentoring Payments
 sonne|work	https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1zDCB8aozZOQJjqDm5rLsOso2xAbIn7OBcYGdLhL7OTs/viewform?pli=1
 sonne|work	HeikoS: so do the supplier enrollment update with your new bank account first and then the mentoring payments one
@HeikoS	sonne|work: ah man, I forgot everything :(
@HeikoS	VAT?
@HeikoS	did I give this?
 sonne|work	look you have the old email
 sonne|work	where it is all written
 van51	sonne|work: I g2g now
 van51	got a dentist appointment :(
 van51	sonne|work: hope everything is ok now
 sonne|work	van51: thanks!
 van51	sonne|work: I'll look for your comments in a couple hours when I'll be back
@HeikoS	sonne|work: what are the time contraints on the PO?
 sonne|work	ASASP
 sonne|work	it is like 5 minutes work
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so the thing is I recently quit my bank account and made another one, I sent the paperworks last week and it should be ready soon, but I dont have one yet
@HeikoS	could give one of my family (which I currently use) but thats not my name and might cause problems later
@HeikoS	I think the new account should be ready within 1-2 weeks
 sonne|work	I see
@HeikoS	so thats why the question
@HeikoS	what are the time contraints
 sonne|work	no in this case we should wait.
 sonne|work	well we cannot start to book flights before we have a PO
 sonne|work	otherwise I just want to have all the paperwork off the table
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so in principal we could  do it over another account since we can donate it to the ev this year (which removes it from tax) but thats risky if things dont work out
@HeikoS	so lets just wait a bit, should be soon with the bank
@HeikoS	I already applied for the account ages ago, just needed to send my identification from which I did last week
@HeikoS	I will call them on Monday and ask
 sonne|work	HeikoS: then please do that all yourself
 sonne|work	I forget this stuff
@HeikoS	sonne|work: sure, btw I will probably stay in the US for a bit longer, about 1 week or so
@HeikoS	will search for a flat/room on airbnb that should be cheaper than a hotel
@HeikoS	and maybe rent a car

 thoralf	The brackets are only used to close the scope and force destruction of w.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: a double call to SG_UNREF?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No.  w gets initialized by SGVector(array, len)
 thoralf	iglesiasg: And upon destruction, it frees memory behind svm.w
 thoralf	get_w() is just: return SGVector<float32_t>(w, w_dim);
 thoralf	Which does not reference counting on *w*.  It simply passes a reference, which is then freed by SGVector... the state is already corrupted after destruction of the first w above.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: can you tell me which get_w you mean?
@iglesiasg	the one in LinearMachine?
 thoralf	COnlineLinearMachine::SGVector<float32_t> get_w()
@iglesiasg	thoralf: why doesn't it reference count on w?
@iglesiasg	shogun/machine/StructuredOutputMachine.cpp
@iglesiasg	shit, sorry
@iglesiasg	I meant
@iglesiasg	SGVector(T* v, index_t len, bool ref_counting=true)

@iglesiasg	sonne|work: it seems that SerializableJsonFile import error happens in the buildbot as well as in travis
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I don't understand.  *w* is a array of floats - SG_REF can only be called on SGReferencedData objects, right?
-!- foulwall [~user@2001:da8:215:6110:dd27:e03b:e5a:cb89] has joined #shogun
 foulwall	hey sonne|work, sorry for the campus network crash...
@iglesiasg	thoralf: no. SGReferencedData are objects for which automatic memory management is provided
@iglesiasg	so there is no need to call SG_REF and SG_UNREF with them
@iglesiasg	SG_REF and SG_UNREF are used for all SGObjects
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Okay, but then there is no way to track w's references.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I am not sure I understand, can you ellaborate?
@iglesiasg	I mean, if a SGVector is created via SGVector(T*,index_t)
@iglesiasg	then I believe that there is no new memory allocated
 thoralf	Correct.  SGVector(w,len)
@iglesiasg	apart from the attributes of the SGVector (the pointer, the length, etc)
 thoralf	but w is still beeing used by onlinelinearmachine
 thoralf	So if SGVector is destructed, w is freed.
@iglesiasg	why is it a problem?
@iglesiasg	no
 thoralf	But it is!
 thoralf	I see it in the debugger. ;)
 shogun-buildbot	build #1158 of bsd1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1158  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
@iglesiasg	w is freed if there is no other reference pointing
@iglesiasg	aham! then there should be a bug
 thoralf	I think there are two solutions:
@iglesiasg	ok I think maybe I get it now
 thoralf	1. copy w into new memory
 thoralf	2. onlinelinearmachine maintains an own sgvector to pass around.
@iglesiasg	yes
 shogun-buildbot	build #990 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/990  blamelist: iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 thoralf	like linearmachine does
@iglesiasg	I think the solution is the second, that the onlinelinearmachine uses an sgvector
@iglesiasg	or
@iglesiasg	that the get method creates the vector with the third argument to false
 thoralf	Okay, I just tried copying w - and it seems to work without leaking.
@iglesiasg	how without copying w?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Then I need to add a private member to store a sgvector instance.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No, I would need to refactor the class: replacing (float * w, int w_dim) by (sgvector w) to make sure there's no confusion which one to keep up-to-date.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: (float * w, int w_dim) gets resized while learning.
@iglesiasg	thoralf: I agree with you, using SGVector is better
 thoralf	iglesiasg: The code is nearly untested - it would be suicide to start refactoring. ;)
@iglesiasg	yes, it may be a good idea to add a couple of unit tests first and then refactor
 thoralf	iglesiasg: If OnlineLinearMachine turns out to be useful, I see what I can do.

@sonney2k	van51, ohh I just see n-bits - could you make 20 the default
@sonney2k	not 50
@sonney2k	that would be a bit too much
 van51	sonney2k: oops it was 50?
@sonney2k	van51, now could you do that with dot-features
 van51	sonney2k: I already have a class ready
@sonney2k	van51, so you have string features underneath and do the dense_dot and add_to_dense_vec functions
@sonney2k	in the very same way you did that before
 van51	sonney2k: I wanted to add some covariance and average methods that I saw that exist
 van51	sonney2k: and I was looking for a collection to test it
@sonney2k	once that is done we try some simple example distinguishing say german from english text which you can then extend to say 30-50 languages
@sonney2k	van51, you can create a simple test for add_to_dense_vec

@sonney2k	and compare against what you get with your converter
@sonney2k	van51, similar with dense_dot
