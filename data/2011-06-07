* sonney2k Re
@sonney2k	serialhex, I don't understand your patch - what is it good for?
 serialhex	sorry for the delay sonney2k, it's basically to test if the modules load, very simple i know, i've got to find some time to copy over the tests & examples from python
 serialhex	which do you think i should start with, or should i just start from the beginning?
@sonney2k	serialhex, the libsvm minimal one
 serialhex	ok cool
@sonney2k	../examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_libsvm_minimal_modular.py
 serialhex	ah-HAH!! i knew there was a link somewhere that you wanted me to work on, it must be WAY up in the history...  thanks!
 serialhex	yeah, i'm sorry i havn't been very active, i've been very busy!!
