@sonney2k	Hey there!
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :develop * 5ffe94d / / (4 files): https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/5ffe94d89b87adc1f25c9e5f82aff9e4f9e0779f
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Improve the SVM notebook and add a proper get_likelihood_example
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: function to CGMM and get_likelihood_all_examples to CDistribution
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: Heiko rocks
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what did he do?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: wrote the abstract? ;)
@sonney2k	and hey thoralf notebook finished?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you mean mloss workshop?
 lisitsyn	yes exactly sonney2k
@sonney2k	I thought because of the nice email he sent to the mailinglist.
@sonney2k	and to you all :D
 lisitsyn	hahaa
 lisitsyn	no it is good too but mloss is more significant
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh - we should be at scipy / europython next year too
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw do you have time to do the outline for the notebook?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it looks like I can do that right now
 lisitsyn	let me start
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes please
@sonney2k	besser82, do you have some time? We have this weird issue when cmak'ing that whenever shogun is installed in /usr/local/ before that then the wrong includes are used
 thoralf	sonney2k: No, sorry.  Working on another project takes longer than expected.
@sonney2k	thoralf, ok np
@wiking	m000
@sonney2k	wiking, hey!
@wiking	lisitsyn: have u tried changing the include dirs order?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I failed to reproduce the error!
@wiking	lisitsyn: i remember something like that u tried
@wiking	lisitsyn: aaaah interesting ok
@wiking	lisitsyn: i'll setup a vagrant image and see wtf is happening
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I just had it yesterday
@wiking	sonney2k: on your machine or somewhere where it's available to check remotely?
@sonney2k	on my machine
@sonney2k	wiking, I simply had an old shogun installed in /usr/local
@wiking	sonney2k: you just make install
 shogun-buildbot	build #1974 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1974  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@wiking	and then tried a clean cmake right?
@wiking	sonney2k: old = 2.2 ?
@sonney2k	and then just try to compile w/ python_modular ON
@sonney2k	wiking, something from 1 month ago
 lisitsyn	I tried to break old installation
 lisitsyn	to cause some error
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, did you have python_modular enabled?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes
@wiking	sonney2k: so step 1) checkout a commit from 1 month ago w/o python_modular + make install under /usr/local step 2) checkout HEAD + cmake ?
@wiking	w python modular?
@sonney2k	wiking, exactly that should do it
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i'll check it then
@sonney2k	wiking, cool thanks
@wiking	nw
@wiking	i have almost done a docker image
@wiking	now i've realised that i'll do 2 things
@wiking	docker image with latest stable
@wiking	and a docker image for HEAD
@sonney2k	wiking, I have no idea what that means though
@sonney2k	wiking, can we use these on the fedora cloud?
@wiking	sonney2k: check this out: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker#better-than-vms
@wiking	sonney2k: i've asked besser82 what is the arch they r using for fedora cloud
@wiking	as apparently latest open stack supports docker natively
* sonney2k heiko woke up
* sonney2k heiko is doing some warming up
@sonney2k	wiking, sounds cool
@wiking	sonney2k: so imho this is much better than trying to ship a squashfs
@wiking	for shogun
* sonney2k heiko is praying to the mighty $DEITY living in the sun
@wiking	and they have an online repo where we can easily distribute the docker config for shogun: http://index.docker.io/
@sonney2k	wiking, agreed
@wiking	well yeah going from london to SF is like for me going form belgium to SF
@wiking	suddenly i had a sun overdose :P
* sonney2k heiko is turning reddish
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you are missing such a nice perfomance
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh well I know who to blame
@wiking	btw what is going to be on the demo @ nips/
 lisitsyn	apparently it is me but that woman from the embassy is bad  :D
@wiking	and when's the next dev meeting?
@sonney2k	wiking, demos notebooks and after the release

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, hey there!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: we are on duty with notebook ;)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so we are together in this dim red notebook
@iglesiasg	exactly :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I am trying to come up with some draft
 lisitsyn	actually my idea was like
 lisitsyn	every dr method has its own objective or some assumption
 lisitsyn	like KLLE preserves local patches
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hey
 lisitsyn	mds keeps distances
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, hi there
 lisitsyn	etc
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, btw what is the status of the website?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I have fixed this morning the FAQ page
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I think it looks better in general now
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I would like to change the examples page as I told you last week since I don't really like it like it is
@HeikoS	morning :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, and apart from that, I think the fixing part is done
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, I don't really like either than in the Planet page the date and time when the post was written appears as title
@iglesiasg	http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/planet/shogun
@iglesiasg	it does not feel like the data is so important to show it so much
@iglesiasg	I would put in yellow letter the title that now appears bold and underlined
@HeikoS	iglesiasg, sonney2k +1
@HeikoS	thought that just yesterday
@iglesiasg	with the data I meant the date..
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: heya
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: good job with submission
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thanks :)
@HeikoS	will be nice to show off at NIPS :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I was like 'uh it matters something for people'
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, just do the change then
@iglesiasg	all right
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, planet is completely handled in shogun-web, isn't it?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, there some some planet script that fetches feeds
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, then this script generates a .html which we parse / render on the website
* iglesiasg guesses that is going to be messy :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you should not be so pessimistic, Shogun matters a lot, lots of people know it and told me on the summit
@iglesiasg	I will have a look then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: same in academia
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I am not pessimistic about shogun
 lisitsyn	I am pessimistic about all the shit around you know
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: besides, biggest ML project out there. so cheer up :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I know
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that's why sonney2k calls me marvin
@sonney2k	:D
@HeikoS	sonney2k is almost as pessimistic as you ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I learnt it from him
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	I was happy before shogun :D
 lisitsyn	jk
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you should ask HeikoS whenever you are demotivated
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah come on. you should take an example from us, we are singing "shogun is great" all day
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, you cannot imagine his excitement when being waken up to let the new day begin
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: how does that work?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what's wrong with him? :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  just send you a photo I just made for happiness reasons
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I recorded a lecture HeikoS gave me about nuts - you cannot imagine his dedication to eating nuts. Maybe it is them.
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, he took the photo while I was asleep in the same room - I couldn't stop him
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: lol
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and you know what is worst - HeikoS is forcing me to be happy and smile all day!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh man.. that's the worst part
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, now you understand how *much* I miss you and your support here!
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah I would help you to get depressed
 naywhayare	HeikoS: sonney2k: the benchmarking system got rejected from the workshop, so I guess I won't see either of you there. :(
 naywhayare	it was good to meet you at the mentor summit though :)
@HeikoS	naywhayare: hey!
@HeikoS	naywhayare: Ah too bad, it would have fit in there so nicely
 naywhayare	yeah -- I think we proposed it wrong in the abstract.  basically both the reviews went off on tangents: "you can't effectively compare timing like that" and/or "I don't quite understand the system"
@HeikoS	naywhayare: good to meet you too, lets stay in touch with this nice framework
 naywhayare	yeah.  I think it's of utility, and if you guys wanted to set up your own instance of it (or update scripts for ours) we can help out
@HeikoS	naywhayare: we totally want something like that, we even thought of maybe denoting a gsoc slot to that if possible next year
 naywhayare	I had never expected our student to do as awesome of a job as he has, so it was a very good use of a gsoc slot
@HeikoS	naywhayare: yeah! :)
@HeikoS	naywhayare: are you still in california?
@HeikoS	california
@HeikoS	we are currently hiking through some national parks, quite fun
 naywhayare	HeikoS: yeah; I stayed at a friend's in Mountain View
 naywhayare	my flight leaves in about 3 hours, then I head back to Atlanta to work on the AISTATS paper and do nothing else until november... :-\
 naywhayare	what do you think of southern california?  (that's where you are, right?)
@sonney2k	naywhayare, joshua tree is where we are currently
 naywhayare	I've never been there although I did drive through LA recently and sit in a lot of traffic...
@sonney2k	hot
@sonney2k	yes traffic hell
@sonney2k	it is kind of living next to the autobahn
 naywhayare	oh yeah, I actually was kind of close to there; it's really hot and really quiet

 naywhayare	I spent a lot of time when we passed through imagining how many people had died out there from dehydration...
@sonney2k	naywhayare, HeikoS says sorry his machine went kaboom
 naywhayare	haha
 naywhayare	are you guys planning to go to the Salton Sea?  I have always wanted to go there and find one of these:

@sonney2k	naywhayare, too far
 naywhayare	yeah, it's a bit of a ways away
@sonney2k	naywhayare, we are heading today afternoon to santa barbara
@HeikoS	suuurfing :)
 naywhayare	:)
 naywhayare	I have never successfully surfed.  the only thing I can do is get hit by waves !
 naywhayare	HeikoS: you are an expert surfer?
@HeikoS	naywhayare: no beginner still, but I have done it a few years already
 naywhayare	very cool
@HeikoS	haha, hitting by waves is what it should be called ;)
@HeikoS	90% of the time is spent doing exactly this
@HeikoS	and once in a while you get lucky ;)
@HeikoS	naywhayare: we are heading off now, see you later!
 naywhayare	have fun! :)
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, sonney2k yeah guys, have lot of fun!
