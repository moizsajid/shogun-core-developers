 rrenaud	does shogun support online learning besides perceptron?
 Ram108	vopal wabbit
 Ram108	i am learning that stuff too
 Ram108	its pretty cool :P

 Ram108	hi anybody there?
 blackburn1	Ram108: yeah, I'm here
 Ram108	hi i have some queries
 Ram108	could u clear them out please
 blackburn1	sure, shoot
 Ram108	firstly i have recently started with machine learning
 Ram108	and i have googled up some tool boxes and found urs to be good
 blackburn1	ok, you told it to us day before ;)
 Ram108	but couldnt quite figure out were to start learning
 Ram108	yeah but i didnt get any response lol :P
 Ram108	am sort of desperate to learn it
 Ram108	lol :P
 blackburn1	Ram108: well you could start with trying various methods
 Ram108	and i really want to contribute in whatever little way i can to shogun
 Ram108	methods as in?
 blackburn1	well e.g. with given data you could try different methods of classification
-!- ishaan_ [~chatzilla@14.98.156.214] has joined #shogun
 blackburn1	or clustering, or regression
 Ram108	like MLP RBF etc etc yeah sure
 Ram108	i ll try them :)
 Ram108	and i noticed shogun does not contain MLP
 Ram108	would it be useful if i were to implement them?
 blackburn1	Ram108: sorry what is MLP?
-!- ishaan [~chatzilla@121.245.41.95] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
 Ram108	multi layered perceptron
-!- ishaan_ is now known as ishaan
 Ram108	sorry
 blackburn1	hmm sure feel free to impelement it
 Ram108	thanks :) well can i email it to you? after i implement it?
 blackburn1	Ram108: we don't have much neural methods, it is welcome for sure
 Ram108	oh thats great news..... i just finished a course on neural networks :)
 blackburn1	Ram108: I would suggest you to ask me about any shogun related questions
 Ram108	okay sure ..... i tried downloading shogun and import sg in python did not work
 blackburn1	Ram108: hmm ok then lets start from installing it firstly ;)
 blackburn1	did you use git?
 Ram108	i tried googling it up as well..... sure :)
 Ram108	yeah :)
 Ram108	i did use git :)
 blackburn1	wait, import sg?
 blackburn1	you should use import modshogun
 Ram108	well the example on the website had import sg
 blackburn1	hmm we should fix it ;)
 Ram108	:)
 Ram108	thank you :)
 blackburn1	Ram108: check examples/undocumented/python_modular
 blackburn1	in your clone
 blackburn1	btw try to run any classifier_* example
 Ram108	oh okay i ll get back to you once i try that :)
 Ram108	sure thank you :)
 blackburn1	okay, don't hesitate to ask anything
 blackburn1	I like receiving emails lol :)
 Ram108	thank you for ur time :) greatly appreciate it :)
 Ram108	lol :) do u mind i know who you are?
 Ram108	i am Ram :)
 blackburn1	Ram108: my name is Sergey Lisitsyn, I'm a gsoc 2011 student of shogun that became a core developer
 Ram108	cool :P i have read about u implementing Vowpal wabbit
 Ram108	thats awesome :)
 blackburn1	no
 blackburn1	that wasn't me ;)
 Ram108	oh am sorry
 blackburn1	not a problem ;)
 Ram108	:)
 blackburn1	I have implemented a lot of dimension reduction stuff
 Ram108	nice :)
 blackburn1	but I still do some development of these methods
 Ram108	i am having dependency issues i ll resolve them and get back to u :)
 Ram108	if you dont mind can i have ur email id pls?
 blackburn1	blackburn91@gmail.com
-!- ishaan [~chatzilla@14.98.156.214] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 Ram108	thank you a lot :)
 blackburn1	Ram108: what are the dependencies you have to resolve?
 blackburn1	btw, what is the os you are using?
 Ram108	ubuntu distro maverick meerkat.... 10.10
 blackburn1	oh nice, you won't have any problems
 Ram108	thank you :)
 blackburn1	I'm using 10.04 and sonney2k is using debian (he is a debian developer)
 Ram108	oh nice :)
 Ram108	No module named shogun.Features
 Ram108	thats the error i keep getting
 Ram108	:( lol
 Ram108	is it that i didnt install shogun properly?
 blackburn1	Ram108: how did you install it?
 Ram108	well i installed the dependencies using apt-get package manager as well as synaptic
 Ram108	then downloaded shogun frm git via the terminal
 Ram108	thats it
 Ram108	do i have to do anythn else?
 blackburn1	Ram108: sure, you should run 'configure --interfaces=python_modular' in src/ of shogun
 blackburn1	then make
 blackburn1	and sudo make install
 Ram108	Mr soeren does not seem active here
 Ram108	yeah i did that
 blackburn1	he is pretty busy
 Ram108	but not the configure thinge
 blackburn1	much more than me
 Ram108	oh hmmm :)
 Ram108	initially i did./configure... then sudo make....... then sudo make install
 blackburn1	almost right
 blackburn1	but --interfaces=python_modular
 blackburn1	in configure params
 blackburn1	to compile with python modular interface support
 Ram108	oh hmmm i ll purge it then reinstall it
 Ram108	hope it wont affect the dependencies
-!- puneetgoyal [~chatzilla@115.242.19.18] has joined #shogun
 Ram108	yeah am on it again...... ./configure --interfaces=python_modular
 blackburn1	make sure configure went smooth
 Ram108	the final line is "Result is no"
 blackburn1	hmm
 blackburn1	what is last Checking for X .. no?
 blackburn1	I guess Python numpy developer files?
 Ram108	nope the same error again
 Ram108	i have numpy
 Ram108	i have used it previously
 blackburn1	dev?
 blackburn1	get sure you have python-numpy-dev package installed
 Ram108	yeah i guess numpy is the issue
 Ram108	oh thanks i ll install it off synaptic now
 Ram108	i dont think there is numpy-dev
 Ram108	there is just numpy and numpy-dbg

 blackburn1	Ram108: swig has to have headers to compile interface
 Ram108	am sorry i dont understand
 Ram108	both the package managers dont have python-numpy-dev
 blackburn1	I meant numpy-dev is headers of numpy
 blackburn1	ehmm
 blackburn1	ahh
 Ram108	oh am sorry i ll google that up
 blackburn1	can't be
-!- blackburn1 is now known as blackburn
 blackburn	I have one in 10.04 :)
 Ram108	gosh..... i ll try procuring them..... thanks
 blackburn	how can it be?
 Ram108	i ll send u a screen shot of the list i have
 blackburn	Ram108: try to 'sudo apt-get install python-numpy-dev'
 Ram108	already tried
 Ram108	terminal says try python-numpy instead
 Ram108	and wen i try that "all packages upto date"
 blackburn	ehmm may be you have some untypical sources for packages?
 Ram108	oh god!!! lol :P i ll try downloading the .tar file for that
 blackburn	Ram108: noo
 blackburn	I got wrong sorry
 Ram108	oh erm?
 blackburn	python-dev
 blackburn	orr
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	python-dev
 blackburn	not numpy dev, sorry
 Ram108	oh lol :P
 Ram108	oh god thats a big file :P 18 mins left lol
 Ram108	why isnt the classifiers of shogun well completed? i mean on the web page it says so
 Ram108	that prompted me to implement MLPs
 blackburn	Ram108: what do you mean?
 Ram108	i meant classifiers like multilayered perceptrons and radial basis functions were not used much(neural networks) any specific reason for that?
 blackburn	do you ask why we have no MLP and etc?
 Ram108	yeah?
 blackburn	well we have a lot of svms ;)
 Ram108	cool :)
 blackburn	as shogun was developed for some bioinformatics tasks SVMs were more important
 Ram108	and the 7 methods you implemented can reduce any n dimensional vector set to 3 or 2 dimensional vector sets right?
 Ram108	oh hmmm :)
 blackburn	Ram108: yes
 Ram108	awesome :)
 blackburn	not a vector but a set of vectors
 Ram108	thanks a lot :) i feel humbled lol :P
 Ram108	oh thanks :)
 Ram108	finally installing.....
 blackburn	Ram108: e.g.:

 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/faces.pdf
 Ram108	sheesh..... thats amazing.....
 Ram108	is the facial expression thinge fast?
 Ram108	how long did it take?
 Ram108	god! the same error again :(
 blackburn	Ram108: 1-2s
 Ram108	python3-all-dev and python2.6-dev installed
 Ram108	okay :)
 blackburn	did you configure with python modular enabled?
 Ram108	no i used synaptic package manager.... how do i do that?
 blackburn	./configure --interfaces=python_modular?
 Ram108	yeah i ll do that again
 Ram108	yeah :) :D :P i think this time i can see some magic :)
 Ram108	finally its working :)
 Ram108	big time thanks :)
 Ram108	thank you so much for your time Mr.Lisitsyn
 Ram108	i ll work through them and learn them
 Ram108	thank you once again
 Ram108	bye

@sonney2k	you have snow!
@sonney2k	I hope you get things turned peacefully...

 blackburn	I'm pretty proud with these guys :)
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: you could use any
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, just use e.g. libsvm for starters
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: can you suggest any one of them, which I should start reading about
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: as Soeren told, try svm
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: ok,thanks :)

 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rdd53927 / src/configure : add /usr/include/atlas to include paths - http://git.io/UF-v5Q
 rrenaud	does anyone use shogun for online learning? i am reading some of the code for the VW wrapper, and it seems to require using file i/o, which seems kind of annoying
@sonney2k	rrenaud, how else could you do online learning?
 rrenaud	i generate feature vectors in memory, send them to the system, get predictions (maybe with labels), and it maybe updates its model if i gave labels
@sonney2k	I see - I suggest to ask shashwat about that (cc'ing me)

 15SAAI18M	shogun: /usr/include/atlas in includepath - http://git.io/zbQf_w
@sonney2k	rrenaud, what you could certainly do is just collect a batch of features train the model with that set and then collect a new set and train again and it will just update it's parameters
@sonney2k	I am saying batch because update costs w/o batch might be too hight
