 sonne|work	moin blackburn
 blackburn	hi
 sonne|work	I finally understood the typemap issue
 sonne|work	typecheck typemaps are only called when there is ambiguity
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	and what is called if no?
 sonne|work	e.g. if there are 2 functions named e.g. set_vector(float64_t*,int32_t)  / set_vector(SGVector<> v)
 sonne|work	if not then the function is *always* called
 blackburn	hmm
 sonne|work	so it needs to check the type too
 sonne|work	that's all
 sonne|work	I will rework the typemaps hopefully tonight
 blackburn	anyway we should remove float64_t*, int32_t stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: I ran tests yesterday, did HMM fail before?
 sonne|work	blackburn: the problem only occurs when the float64_t* stuff is *not* there
 blackburn	sonne|work: heh I see
 sonne|work	blackburn: re HMM I don't remember
 sonne|work	you need to test it
 sonne|work	btw regarding your valgrind question
 sonne|work	you can use valgrind surpressions
 blackburn	sonne|work: that is not about supression but necessarity of testing with valgrind
 sonne|work	there used to be a suppression file somewhere in /usr/share/doc/python*
 sonne|work	then you will only see shogun errors not the python ones
 sonne|work	(which are in fact false alarms)
 blackburn	i.e. if there is grep shogun then something goes wrong
 blackburn	sonne|work: IIRC I would need to recompile my python to use it, it is not the problem I describe
 sonne|work	no you don't need to recompile python for that
 sonne|work	it is just a list of errors to ignore
 sonne|work	...that you pass to valgrind
 blackburn	sonne|work: I would like you to test HMM cause I really don't know how to use it
 blackburn	the results are different from ones we have now
 sonne|work	did the tests fail in 1.0.0 ?
 blackburn	sonne|work: ah do you suggest to test it with 1.0.0?
 blackburn	hmm why not ok
 sonne|work	I mean then we know whether we introduced this problem in 1.1...
 blackburn	sonne|work: I started playing with SVMs and noticed that classifier/svm is like a dark forest
 blackburn	so much 'unstructured' code
 sonne|work	what do you mean?
 blackburn	well there are a lot of files with strange names
 sonne|work	you mean like SVM, LDA, PCA, :D
 blackburn	no codestyle in sources
 blackburn	i.e. some of them are uppercase
 blackburn	some are lower
 blackburn	etc
 sonne|work	please be more specific
 sonne|work	or give me an example
 blackburn	sonne|work: the code is impossible to maintain
 blackburn	at least for me
 sonne|work	which code?
 blackburn	what if there is an error?
 blackburn	any svm
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have no idea how to maintain it properly
 sonne|work	you mean the deep internals of svm algo's?
 blackburn	yes
 sonne|work	yes that is impossible for non-experts
 sonne|work	that is why everyone uses e.g. libsvm's code as black box
 sonne|work	well ok I did a couple of changes to libsvm but tested them
 sonne|work	and you can only do it when you have read their paper...
 blackburn	sonne|work: hmm I think it is the same for dimreduction and you
 blackburn	my code is as well non comprehensive
 blackburn	:D
 sonne|work	exactly :)
 sonne|work	it takes a *long* time to understand it...
 blackburn	sonne|work: especially in the case of LLE
 blackburn	I did it with alignment and it is not as in the paper
 blackburn	that's why it $\infty$ times faster than any other impl
 blackburn	I wonder, sonne|work did you ever heard anything about elections in russia this week?
 blackburn	I think nobody even knows what is going one cause nobody cares :)
 blackburn	but still interested
 sonne|work	no
 sonne|work	what happened?
-!- in3xes [~in3xes@180.149.49.230] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 blackburn	sonne|work: well we all know who will be elected :D
 blackburn	government party cheats way too much..
 sonne|work	like everywhere...
 blackburn	sonne|work: you can't imagine how much
 blackburn	sonne|work: we know who will be president for 4 years already
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes, there is an regression with HMM between 1.0.0 and 1.1.0

 blackburn	hah my new lcd screen for the notebook has finally arrived
 blackburn	67 days in the loong way home :D
 blackburn	crazy, it took 67 days to move from GB to Russia
 sonne|work	blackburn: congrats
 blackburn	sonne|work: have 3 mins?
 sonne|work	blackburn: regarding the HMM regression - could you do a git bisect to figure out the commit that is causing the trouble?
 blackburn	sonne|work: sure, this night
 blackburn	sonne|work: what is the multiclass SVM you would suggest to use?
 sonne|work	ask but I may have to leave
 sonne|work	GMNPSVM
 blackburn	I used larank
 sonne|work	(true multiclass)
 blackburn	is it worse?
 sonne|work	one is online one not
 blackburn	GMNPSVM looks to took infinity time
 sonne|work	larank can be faster on more data
 sonne|work	sure
 blackburn	will it produce better accuracy?
 sonne|work	how many classes /data points
 sonne|work	I would expect so
 blackburn	43 classes, 200-600 each
 blackburn	LibSVMMultiClass was slightly worse, 84% accuracy
 blackburn	and with LaRank I got ~87%
 sonne|work	precompute kernel matrix?
 sonne|work	ok but then you are already pretty good
 blackburn	sonne|work: gaussian on HOG  :)
 blackburn	can I expect any other impact on accuracy with GMNPSVM?
 blackburn	it is pretty good indeed but others got almost 99 with convolutional neural networks
 blackburn	I would like to beat them hah
 blackburn	I guess you had to leave :)
 sonne|work	well convolutional NN are very hard to beat
 sonne|work	for such obj. recognition tasks
 blackburn	sonne|work: aren't they overfitted?
 blackburn	are they really so good?
 sonne|work	http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 sonne|work	they can be when done right
 sonne|work	alright back to work
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	hmm I'm in doubts
 blackburn	I guess I have to try CNNs..
 sonne|work	I would be very interested in the results
 sonne|work	btw, did you use larank from shogun?
 sonne|work	did you normalize your data?
 sonne|work	did you add virtual examples (by rotating/shifting objects?)
 sonne|work	scaling etc
 sonne|work	all these things help
 blackburn	sonne|work: me too, from shogun, normalized but didnot extract RoI, no
 blackburn	sonne|work: I don't like any neural nets, what about you? :)
 sonne|work	me neither
 sonne|work	too many local minima
 sonne|work	very hard to control
 blackburn	I don't have much SVM experience
 blackburn	but it seems to be better
 sonne|work	well it is a convex optimizationproblem so local minima == global minima
 sonne|work	it helps a lot when you know that the same choice of model parameters leads to the same result
 blackburn	as I understand
 blackburn	SVM will have similar results on slightly different data
 blackburn	but NN could get totally wrong
 blackburn	right?
 blackburn	like ill-posed things in linalg
 sonne|work	like trying to find the root's of a polynomial with *many* variables
 blackburn	time to go to gym :)
