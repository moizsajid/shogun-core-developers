 kocki	hello
 kocki	i have a question
 kocki	may i link to shogun from my application without releasing it under the gpl?
 sonne|work	well you can use any gpl compatible license for your code
 sonne|work	kocki: ^
 sonne|work	but you have to opensource your code  under a compat license if you want to distribute the conglomerate product
 kocki	ok, thank you
 kocki	i'm afraid, that won't be possible
 kocki	then, i'll have to use libsvm or some other library
 sonne|work	kocki: look at scikits learn or torch or browse mloss.org
 sonne|work	maybe you'll find sth
 kocki	thank you very much! i'll do that
 kocki	scikit learn is for python, but i need something for c++

 sonne|work	kocki: dlib ml?
 sonne|work	anyways no idea really what is best for you
 kocki	i'm looking at dlib at the moment. looks promising
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw I don't really understand why we are GPL ;)
 sonne|work	hehe
 blackburn	sonne|work: testing now
 blackburn	Ram108: if you would read logs you should contact me with blackburn91@gmail.com
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r52f7c5a / data : Update data - http://git.io/dB580Q
 blackburn	sonne|work: did you already turned off trac?
 sonne|work	not intentionally
 sonne|work	is it off?
 sonne|work	looks like
 sonne|work	hmhh
 sonne|work	well then one more reason to migrate :D
 sonne|work	I have to check why it is not running but cannot do that from here
 blackburn	sonne|work: I guess your kids did
 blackburn	sonne|work: I hardly remember all the issues ;)
 sonne|work	well then make a new plan for 1.2 - right?
 sonne|work	like swig 2.0.4 as hard requirement and stuff
 shogun-buildbot	build #388 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/388
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm not sure it is an issue
 shogun-buildbot	build #363 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/363
 blackburn	sonne|work: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/words.png did I show it to you?
 blackburn	LLE with 'diff' Custom kernel defined on words
 blackburn	Kernel LLE in fact
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf77788a / applications/dimreduction/words_embedding.py : Updated words embedding application - http://git.io/cTpkLw
 kocki	i just want to thank you and tell you that i will try dlib. bye
 sonne|work	kocki: ok - np
 sonne|work	blackburn: which kernel is this?
 sonne|work	CommWordStringKernel with sorted preproc?
 blackburn	sonne|work: custom
 blackburn	for i in range(N):
 blackburn	for j in range(i,N):
 blackburn	s = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None,words[i],words[j])
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	dist_matrix[i,j] = s.ratio()
 blackburn	should be kernel_matrix ;)
 sonne|work	I would suggest to just use CommWordStringKernel for that ... no idea what sequence matcher does though
 sonne|work	the Comm* kernel will count e.g. 2 mers
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'll try

 blackburn	sonne|work: how to use it? :)
 blackburn	got it
 blackburn	but results are worse or I set wrong params
 sonne|work	I need to see the code
 blackburn	cf = StringCharFeatures(words, RAWBYTE)
 blackburn	wf = StringWordFeatures(RAWBYTE)
 blackburn	wf.obtain_from_char(cf,0,1,2,False)
 blackburn	return CommWordStringKernel(wf,wf)
 blackburn	sonne|work: words are ['publishing','below',...]
 blackburn	you said something about sorted preprocs?
 sonne|work	blackburn: yes look in the example kernel_commwo*
 sonne|work	otherwise result will be crap
 blackburn	yeah it is now
 blackburn	sonne|work: what is order,start and gap?
 sonne|work	order is ngram length (use 2)
 sonne|work	start is usually order-1
 sonne|work	and gab is not used
 sonne|work	so IIRC 0
 blackburn	sonne|work: hmm pretty interesting results too
 sonne|work	you could use CommUlongStringKernel instead
 sonne|work	and the up to order 4
 blackburn	sonne|work: got something like that http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/words.png
 sonne|work	works well right?
 blackburn	sonne|work: sure
 sonne|work	was that order 4?
 sonne|work	or 2?
 blackburn	sonne|work: 2, 4 wasn't working at all
 sonne|work	4 is too tough I guess
 sonne|work	there are rarely 3-mer matches
 sonne|work	we should have hashed string features too
 sonne|work	but currently these only exist for DNA

 song	Hi  I was trying to use R-shogun interface with the example script: kernel_oligo_string_modular.R. I got the following error when excuting line 16:  > dump <- feats_train$set_features(feats_train, fm_train_dna) Error in feats_train$set_features(feats_train, fm_train_dna) :   could not find function "f"  Could anyone help me to interpret this error message?

 Guest32426	i cannot send question to the shogun maillist so I post it here.
