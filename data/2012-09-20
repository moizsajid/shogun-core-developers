@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah that is difficult
@sonney2k	blackburn1, I mean
 blackburn1	sonney2k: what do you mean? :)
 blackburn1	sonney2k: are you ok commiting memory leaknig solution? I would never commit in other case
@sonney2k	blackburn, I prefer crashing solutions :D
@sonney2k	btw: http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/
 blackburn1	no, I've got no crashes now, but some leaks
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yeah russian maps are even worse
 blackburn1	sonney2k: erroneous street names, etc
 blackburn1	no houses at map at all
@sonney2k	yeah tomtom maps are best in europe...
 blackburn1	is that tomtom maps?
@sonney2k	based on at least
@sonney2k	http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/11/apple-tomtom-ios-6-maps/
 blackburn1	so your fail? :D
 blackburn1	okay let me commit that big stuff
@sonney2k	well they have much more... POIs, 3d buildings, satellite images
@sonney2k	from other sources I guess
 blackburn1	sonney2k: do you work with hyperspectral stuff?
@sonney2k	map data from tomtom is pretty good
@sonney2k	blackburn1 what?
 blackburn1	my gf is going to research that for masters
 blackburn1	hyperspectral imaging
@sonney2k	however only for car navigation
@sonney2k	I am not sure it makes that much sense on a phone
@sonney2k	in particular you want restaurants and public transport on a phone
 blackburn1	I mean to obtain data
 blackburn1	not for endpoint
@sonney2k	and that is data that you can only get from the crowd
 CIA-31	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra58fa6e / (21 files in 16 dirs): Made SGString based on the SGReferencedData class - http://git.io/XUD_Wg
@sonney2k	no idea
 blackburn1	big dangerous shit
 blackburn1	but we have to do that
 blackburn1	lets see what buildbot say
 blackburn1	okay I will continue to fix these things this weekend
 blackburn1	see ya
