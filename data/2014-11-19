@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: hey
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn:  heya
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1:can you please guide me to some work on release? :D
@lisitsyn	I feel absolutely no control of what is going so I have no clue
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: there are not many things missing
 HeikoS1	wiking's swig issue
 HeikoS1	wiking's osx issue
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I am like on sick leave for a few days more
 HeikoS1	but what you could do
 HeikoS1	is some doc fixes in doxygen
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: warnings?
 HeikoS1	its a bit messy atm, broken links
@lisitsyn	like doc warnnings?
 HeikoS1	and link our md files properly
 HeikoS1	I opened an issue a while ago
 HeikoS1	thats good for release
@lisitsyn	ok let me do that then
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I will write a script for d-ptrs then
 HeikoS1	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/
@lisitsyn	after that
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: please focus on release, its important :)
 HeikoS1	some links are broken
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yes
 HeikoS1	dptrs prototype also good
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: there are also tons of clean ups to do
 HeikoS1	check my latest opned issues for the doc stuff
 HeikoS1	thats actually important for release
@lisitsyn	ok let me check then
 HeikoS1	like get rid of many doxygen things and replace with md text files that are editable from wiki
 HeikoS1	clean up etc
 HeikoS1	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2602
 HeikoS1	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2599
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: update the install guide
 HeikoS1	so that doxygen contains the same as md files
 HeikoS1	actually we dont want anything in doxygen files, it all should come from md
 HeikoS1	so that its easier to maintain
@lisitsyn	oh lets stop at this point :D
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: oh, and: push wiking ;)
@lisitsyn	sounds like I am loaded :)
 HeikoS1	basically the tutorial on doxygen sould also be migrated to md files /wiki
 HeikoS1	you need to be creative :D
 HeikoS1	ok ill stop
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: not a matter of creativity :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I tend to think I am creative sometimes ;)
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: what I mean: you know there are lots of bits and pieces to fix everywhere so just pick among those and come up with cleaner solutions
@lisitsyn	the thing is that I don't have enough focus
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: i actually think you are super creative!
 HeikoS1	well then, important thing is the doc.
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: oh
 HeikoS1	make notebooks work
 HeikoS1	also good
 HeikoS1	and a release blocker
@lisitsyn	hehe okay I've got what are in priority
 HeikoS1	cool
 HeikoS1	"great" that you are sick ;) hehe
 HeikoS1	and get well soon :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I've got that thing causing crazy cough :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: ah if you're not busy I wanted to share some thought
 HeikoS1	im busy, but share anyway  !
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: hehe okay
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: so the thing I started to notice people claim neural network applied to some dataset X is essentially learning some known representation (like gabor filters in images or matrix factorization in word2vec)
 HeikoS1	ok?
@lisitsyn	I am curious whether it could be moving to the point neural nets are just discovering some representations for us
@lisitsyn	and then we still build domain models on top of it
@lisitsyn	but it would be still engineered based on the thing it learn
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: like in the end we still do something similar to bayesian (first engineer our priors adjusted to what top neural models do)
 shogun-buildbot	build #888 of precise - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/precise%20-%20libshogun/builds/888  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>
 HeikoS1	I see
 HeikoS1	well its kind of orthogonal idea
 HeikoS1	once you learned a representation
 HeikoS1	you have it
 HeikoS1	so why model it
 HeikoS1	why would one build a model of it?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: careful with bayesian, once you have seen the data once, you cannot use it again
 HeikoS1	otherwise you get inconsistetn
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I mean
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: neural nets tend to learn some representations like gabor filters
@lisitsyn	but it is just approximate
@lisitsyn	can't we just use gabor filters then whatever it learns
 shogun-buildbot	build #915 of FCRH - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FCRH%20-%20libshogun/builds/915  blamelist: Heiko Strathmann <heiko.strathmann@gmail.com>, Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>
 HeikoS1	I guess the idea is that you dont specify this beforehand
 HeikoS1	and it turns out that some models are good, so the nn recovers it
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yes and then we can jump back to the models it tries to imitate
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I see some mission in killing neural nets :D what's why I am bothered
 HeikoS1	but why?
 HeikoS1	its good
@lisitsyn	I don't like its nearly infinite capacity and that it replaces everything
@lisitsyn	I actually like what VC says about models
 HeikoS1	it doesnt replace everything
@lisitsyn	tries to :D
 HeikoS1	these things are more engineering kind of things
 HeikoS1	no
 HeikoS1	completely non-interpretable
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: adepts would say it doesn't matter
 HeikoS1	so not good for science, just a tool for engineering
 HeikoS1	for solving concrete problems
 HeikoS1	so just another tool
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: what I mean is that it could be used to discover exact models
 HeikoS1	I dont think so
@lisitsyn	hmm that's good you don't think so
 HeikoS1	its quite different say learning a graphical model of data and representation learning of a nn
@lisitsyn	I mean then it is not obvious :)
 HeikoS1	also keep in mind nns are just gradient descent
 HeikoS1	so just universal function approximator
 HeikoS1	thats all
@lisitsyn	hmm yeah
 HeikoS1	but a model is something more
 HeikoS1	which comes at some costs
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well once we learn that function
@lisitsyn	can't we learn the exact form of it from the approximator?
@lisitsyn	wouldn't it be more reliable and have less complexity
 HeikoS1	but the exact form is useless, it doesnt tell you anything
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: why?
 HeikoS1	you have a representation of the exact form, but its just some weights that dont mean things
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: no
@lisitsyn	I don't mean w1x1 + ..
@lisitsyn	I mean like analogies with some known procedures
@lisitsyn	as I said, filters, matrix factorizations
@lisitsyn	not really like f(g(p(...))) but some tractable procedure that does the same thing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: my main concern is that such a model is much more 'simpler' in means of capacity
 HeikoS1	maybe I dont get you correctly
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: wanna write it down? :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: yeah will try
 HeikoS1	I get what you mean maybe
 HeikoS1	but I think its really a different goal to learn a representation and to fit a model
 HeikoS1	you can use things for one another, but the idea behind it is different
 shogun-buildbot	build #122 of osx2 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed csharp modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/122  blamelist: Wu Lin <yorker.lin@gmail.com>
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I can't stop wondering that I keep being surprised that I know basically nothing about the field I am working in :D
 HeikoS1	why that?
 HeikoS1	I think you know a lot
 HeikoS1	Its not like I know more
 HeikoS1	just my opinion
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: for sure you do :)
 HeikoS1	but I agree its important to know things about big picture
 HeikoS1	not just details
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: I was really following svms but that's it
@lisitsyn	and I can't really understand most of bayesian methods now
@lisitsyn	trying to keep up with that
@lisitsyn	but the thing is that the field gets really big
 HeikoS1	it does
 HeikoS1	but as said
 HeikoS1	its all in bishop ;)
@lisitsyn	hah
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well for example there is a PGM book by koller
@lisitsyn	1280 pages
@lisitsyn	just for pgms :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS1: or say a book by hastie
@lisitsyn	ESL
@lisitsyn	it is big as hell
 HeikoS1	its not important to read everything
@lisitsyn	and still doesn't cover what modern things do
 HeikoS1	just pick something that you get interested and try to understand it
 HeikoS1	check whats happening on the ML conferences
 HeikoS1	and read papers and references
 HeikoS1	then youll get a good pictire
