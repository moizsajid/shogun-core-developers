@sonney2k	blackburn, hey

 blackburn	sonney2k: I see

 sayret	any reason why mahout is not included in the feature matrix?
 sayret	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/
@sonney2k	sayret, it takes *a lot* of time to do that
 sayret	understood, just wondering about the selection
@sonney2k	sayret, if you have time fork the google document and add a mahout column - I will then put it live
@sonney2k	sayret, well the biggest/ most popular ml toolboxes around
 sayret	how did you determine biggest and most popular?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you don't have time to work on it now
@sonney2k	sayret, by knowing what people use
@sonney2k	what has been around a long time
@sonney2k	it is necessarily biased
 sayret	alright, thank you
@sonney2k	even the feature set is
@sonney2k	some might support much more
@sonney2k	we asked every toolbox author to validate their column...
@sonney2k	(and they did)
@sonney2k	but still...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am currently reducing wrapper code size by moving things in features/*.h to .cpp
 sayret	i understand, i was just poked by a mahout supporter when i tweeted about your feature matrix and so wanted to ask you
@sonney2k	sayret, then give them a link to the google docs document and tell them that scikits.learn was not in the list either but they provided one and were immediately put on the website
@sonney2k	s/put on/added to
 sayret	awesome, i'll definitely let them know
