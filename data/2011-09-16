 Fastcall	I'm new to Shogun, I'm running it from command line, but I keep getting the following error:
 Fastcall	[ERROR] Kernel can not process this train feature type: 30 10.
 Fastcall	Anyone have any idea why it's giving me that?
 Fastcall	Is it because of the integer? I thought Shogun could support ints
 Fastcall	Anyone around? Is there a better place to get help on Shogun usage that isn't covered by the docs?
