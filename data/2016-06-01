 OXPHOS_	lambday_: yes!
@lambday_	OXPHOS_: see the issue was, it didn't know how to delete that fucking thing, cause it was trying to rely on default destructor.. now that you have shown it how to delete it, it now works
 OXPHOS_	lambday_: never thought it's the destructor..
 OXPHOS_	lambday_: thanks so much!
@lambday_	OXPHOS_: no worries :)
@lambday_	OXPHOS_: the error msg is very imp you see :)

 deepak_	Hello everyone, I don't understand how to install shogun on my Ubuntu 15.04, I have used make install to create a shogun-install file in my home directory, but what do I do next? The minimal example always has an error
 deepak_	fatal error: shogun/base/init.h: No such file or directory  #include <shogun/base/init.h>
 deepak_	This is what I'm asking

 sanuj	lisitsyn, hello
 deepak_	Hey sanuj, can you help with my problem please?
 sanuj	deepak_, hi
 sanuj	did you build shogun?
 deepak_	Yes I did, by building you mean creating a build folder and then using cmake and then make right?
 sanuj	deepak_, yeah
 sanuj	and you have installed it by doing "make install" in your home directory
 sanuj	is that correct?
 deepak_	Yup
 sanuj	deepak_, did you specify the path while installing it?
 deepak_	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install" like this?
 sanuj	deepak_, yeah maybe
 sanuj	if you have installed it in your home
 deepak_	Yes , I have installed it in my home
 sanuj	then you need to add the path to your installation to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 sanuj	deepak_, you just want c++ or python also?
 deepak_	Just C++ would do
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	just add it to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 deepak_	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/shogun-install/lib" something like this?
 sanuj	deepak_, yeah
 sanuj	check if it works
 deepak_	No, I am getting the same error
 sanuj	deepak_, are you sure the path is correct
 deepak_	The path to?
 sanuj	and how are you compiling the example
 deepak_	g++ -lshogun minimal.cpp -o minimal like this?
 sanuj	deepak_, does your path point to the dir which has libshogun.so (or something like this)
 deepak_	Yes, the contents of  $HOME/shogun-install/lib are libshogun.so  libshogun.so.17  libshogun.so.17.1
 sanuj	deepak_, what does echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH show
 sanuj	from the terminal you are compiling
 deepak_	it shows /home/deepak/shogun-install/lib
 sanuj	deepak_, try this once - "g++ minimal.cpp -lshogun -o minimal"
 sanuj	deepak_, worked?
 deepak_	a sec please
 deepak_	No , the same error
 sanuj	deepak_, try running ldconfig
 deepak_	ok
 sanuj	deepak_, you will need sudo
 sanuj	i guess
 deepak_	Yes I did
 deepak_	Now I compile again?
 sanuj	yeah
 deepak_	Nope, same error

 deepak_	So what shall I do?
 sanuj	deepak_, ask wiking if he is here
 sanuj	it should work
 sanuj	deepak_, most of the devs will be online in a few hours, then you can ask them
 deepak_	He's not,I guess I'll have to wait , thanks for your time ;)
 deepak_	Ok
 sanuj	no problem
@wiking	deepak_: helo
@wiking	what'sup?
 deepak_	Hello wiking
 deepak_	I am trying to install shogun
 deepak_	And I got the aforementioned problems
 deepak_	Shall I describe it again?
@wiking	where is it?
@wiking	here in logs?
@wiking	i'll check
@wiking	w8 couple of mins so that i can read it
 deepak_	Thank you ;)
 deepak_	@Wiking, any idea what the problem might be?

 c4goldsw	lambday, do you have a moment?
@lambday	c4goldsw: sure
 c4goldsw	Great.  I'm still learning C++ and I've come across some syntax that I've never seen in another language before.  Lines 134 - 140 of this: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/mathematics/linalg/internal/implementation/ElementwiseSquare.h
 c4goldsw	lambday specifically, line 139
@lambday	c4goldsw: this would probably help - https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicTemplateKeyword.html
 lisitsyn	haha yeah that's a surprise
 lisitsyn	some syntax glitch haa
@lambday	lisitsyn: the glorified template and typename keywords that bugs everyone
 c4goldsw	Thanks, I'll read that (the space is odd).
@wiking	c4goldsw: yes
@wiking	:>
 c4goldsw	wiking It's fine, had my question answered.
 c4goldsw	Thanks though.

 sanuj	can you review and tell what is missing
@lambday	sanuj: I noticed the other day that HeikoS pronounces your name as "sanuyi".. maybe that's how 'j' plays a role in some languages (jojo = yoyo, jaja = haha).. weird..
-!- AndroUser [~androirc@101.222.229.223] has joined #shogun
@lambday	I will correct him :D
 sanuj	lambday, haha
 sanuj	it's saaanuj
@lambday	yes and the most important part is, "j" is just j.. as in john :D
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	:)
 sanuj	lambday, my passport should come soon now
@lambday	sanuj: cool!
 sanuj	went to the passport office here
 sanuj	will start applying for interns
 sanuj	lambday, is there a chance to get a funded intern in UCL?
 sanuj	:)
@lambday	sanuj: great!
@lambday	sanuj: I am not the right person to ask that ;)
 sanuj	okay
@lambday	sanuj: I'll suggest - finish your gsoc, do the great work you have been doing, and most importantly, finish it.. then with that you apply..
@lambday	you'll have something measurable to show
 sanuj	lambday, yes, i was planning to start my next intern when gsoc ends
 lisitsyn	sanuj: looks good
 sanuj	but for that i need to apply in this month
 sanuj	lisitsyn, we need error handling
 sanuj	and a function to modify already set parameters
@lambday	lisitsyn: sanuj: is it the same tag-ged parameter framework we discussed a while back?
 lisitsyn	lambday: yes
@lambday	lisitsyn: uber cool!
 lisitsyn	sanuj: please add tests for all negative scenarios you can think of
 lisitsyn	get missing parameter
 lisitsyn	set missing parameter - works
 lisitsyn	etc
 lisitsyn	just be sure to separate them
 sanuj	lisitsyn, okay
 sanuj	lisitsyn, do we need a separate function to modify an already parameter
 lisitsyn	sanuj: no, why
 lisitsyn	sanuj: ah btw
 lisitsyn	make set return the old value
 lisitsyn	it should be easy
 sanuj	alright
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and do we need a function to print all parameters in an object
 sanuj	just for the user
 lisitsyn	sanuj: oh yes that would make a lot of sense
 lisitsyn	at least its names
 sanuj	okay
 lisitsyn	sanuj: not print, but return its list
 lisitsyn	like std::vector<std::string> parameters();
 sanuj	this looks cool
 sanuj	lisitsyn, anything else to add in the api
 sanuj	?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: maybe has(str::string) has(Tag<T>)
 lisitsyn	to check whether it has parameter
 sanuj	which returns bool
 lisitsyn	yes
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	anything else?
@lambday	lisitsyn: would this support string based setters/getters as well ?
 lisitsyn	lambday: yes
 AndroUser	Guys, it's Deepak from before
@lambday	lisitsyn: awesome!
 lisitsyn	lambday: currently you need to specify type when you get it by string
 lisitsyn	get("something", Type<int>);
@lambday	lisitsyn: from python?
 sanuj	lambday, look here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8cfacc7a0d1355252c12528031d690b5R315
 lisitsyn	in python it would be
@lambday	get("something", TypeInt)
 lisitsyn	get("something", TypeInt)
 lisitsyn	ye
 lisitsyn	s
 lisitsyn	or maybe just sg.int
 sanuj	that looks better
 sanuj	sg.int
-!- AndroUser is now known as deepak_
 lisitsyn	sanuj: agree
@lambday	sanuj: cool man it already works!
 sanuj	lambday, yep :D
 deepak_	Hi, I'm sorry for disturbing again, how do I get it to work?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, anything else for api?
 sanuj	otherwise i'll add the functions you suggested
@lambday	deepak_: hey! what are you working on?
 sanuj	more unit tests
 sanuj	with error handling
 sanuj	lisitsyn, and then we can move on to swig interface?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yeah probably
 deepak_	@lambday hey, I'm not able to install shogun
 deepak_	Sanuj tried to help, but it didn't seem to work
 sanuj	lambday, you need to check logs for this ^^
@lambday	deepak_: can you share the details? any gists/pastebin links?
 sanuj	lisitsyn, for the commit history in the pr
 sanuj	should i push small commits?
 lisitsyn	sanuj: yes it would help you
 sanuj	there are lots of changes in one commit right now

 arianepaola	hello everyone
 arianepaola	deepak_: please ask your question in the channel, so that more people can help you
 deepak_	Well the thing is I've already asked too many questions and I thought it would be annoying for everyone
 deepak_	Because it is something basic, while everyone is working on something much more important
 arianepaola	did you try to build shogun from git?
 deepak_	No, I downloaded the tar.gz file from the site and installed it
 deepak_	In the quickstart example  chmod +x ./so_multiclass_BMRM && ./so_multiclass_BMRM is running properly , I think the library has installed properly but it's not linking in the c++ program
 arianepaola	Please try to use code from git https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun and then follow https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/QUICKSTART
 arianepaola	There is a clone or download option on github, where you can download a zip of the current git code
 deepak_	OK, give me a moment, I'll try and see if it works

 arianepaola	deepak_: it should work, did you follow the steps in the quickstart: Compile and install SHOGUN-TOOLBOX into home directory
 deepak_	-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred! this is what I get when i try to cmake the git code
 c4goldsw	Could you post the errors into a Gist and link it here, so that we can see the errors?
 c4goldsw	deepak_ ^
 deepak_	https://gist.github.com/deepakkandasamy/ed7e4684177f3121553cd00c26d9681a
 c4goldsw	Looking
 deepak_	thanks :)
 c4goldsw	Actually, could you post the full output please of running "make install"?  Also, what OS are you using?
 deepak_	I have to use cmake before doing make install right?
 deepak_	I'm on Ubuntu 15.04
 c4goldsw	Yes, that's correct.  Could I see the full output please?  That is, all of the output after you run 'make install'.
 deepak_	from the git code or the shogun-4.1.0 ?
 c4goldsw	From your command line :)
 c4goldsw	Hold on a sec.
 deepak_	I am only able to cmake from the shogun-4.1.0 folder
 deepak_	the git version gives the errors and I'm not able to create a make file
 c4goldsw	Then from the code you download from Git please.
 c4goldsw	(After running CMake)
 deepak_	That was the Git errors I posted
 c4goldsw	Alright, I'll work with that then.
 deepak_	Thank you :)
 c4goldsw	It appears as if you're missing CTags (line 19).  I think that all you'll have to do is to just install it, by typing in "sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags"
 c4goldsw	I just referred to this: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CTags
 c4goldsw	Not all of the software needed to compile Shogun is included with it.
 c4goldsw	Run the command above, then trying making it again from the git source code.
 deepak_	OK I'll try and get back ,thanks

@lambday	Saurabh7: haha
@lambday	Saurabh7: well, you can always set things
@lambday	Saurabh7: but more important to know - why doesn't it work

@lambday	Saurabh7: yeah so it is zero by default
@lambday	Saurabh7: wait, but if it is zero, then how does the CKernel::compute work for you?
@lambday	cause that uses the number of threads in pthreaded way
@lambday	deepak__: got your problem solved?
 deepak__	No, not really lambday
@lambday	deepak__: what's the beef?
 deepak__	I don't know, I used the instructions to install shogun, but I'm not able to compile the minima example

@lambday	deepak__: does shogun compile itself?

 deepak__	the minimal example from https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/README_developer
@lambday	if the examples compile and work, then any shogun code should work
 deepak__	No, I get this error
 deepak__	shogun/base/init.h: No such file or directory
@lambday	deepak__: where did you install it?
@lambday	install shogun I mean
 deepak__	In my home directory
@lambday	are you specifying the include path then?
 deepak__	I did something of that sort, but I'm not sure if I did it right
@lambday	deepak__: can you paste the cmd you're using for compiling your example?
 deepak__	g++ minimal.cpp -lshogun -o minimal
@lambday	deepak__: it doesn't specify the include path
 deepak__	So what should it look like?
@lambday	do something like g++ -I/path/to/your/shogun/install/dir minimal.cpp -lshogun -o minimal
 deepak__	ah okay I'll get bsck to you in a sec
 deepak__	back *
@lambday	also, probably you have to add the path to libshogun.so as well.. either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to specify that or "-L/path/to/your/shogun/install/dir/lib -lshogun"
@lambday	Saurabh7: I'll check the result in my machine and let you know
 Saurabh7	lambday: ok thanks
 Saurabh7	just wanted to put it in a unit test so wanted to double check with someone
@lambday	Saurabh7: in that case, let me check right now
 deepak__	lamday: g++ -I$HOME/shogun-install1/include/shogun minimal.cpp -L$HOME/shogun-install1/lib -lshogun -o minimal
 deepak__	this was my command
 deepak__	I still get the same error

 Saurabh7	lambday: but should it be num of cores ?
 Saurabh7	shouldnt

 deepak_	lambday: after installing libhdf5 i get the same errors
 deepak_	Should I be linking something?
@lambday	deepak_: libhdf5-devel :P
 deepak_	sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev , this right?
@lambday	deepak_: yes
 deepak_	Yup, I still get those same old errors
@lambday	deepak_: wait
@lambday	you can turn it off from cmake
@lambday	run ccmake ..
@lambday	it will give you available options and their values that are set
@lambday	just turn hdf5 off
@lambday	I wonder why it didn't work even after installing hdf5
 deepak_	lambday: It says that the hdf5_dir is not found in ccmake
 deepak_	Does that help?
@lambday	deepak_: did you find any option that tells to turn this thing off altogether?
@lambday	deepak_: actually it is a bug I think.. if cmake couldn't find hdf5 properly, it should turn this thing off and move on assuming it's not there
@lambday	wiking: ^
@lambday	arianepaola: ^
 deepak_	It was turned on, I turned it off and configured ,generated and exited
@lambday	deepak_: then run make
 arianepaola	lambday: probably a bug, with libhdf5-dev installed it was working for me
@lambday	arianepaola: same here.. but deepak_ had a problem even with libhdf5-dev installed
@lambday	dunno what it is
 arianepaola	lambday: I have all development libs installed on 14.04 and 16.04 and it is working
 arianepaola	maybe some strange corner case
 arianepaola	deepak_: it would be very helpful, if you could open an issue on github, mentioning the error and also your system configuration
 deepak_	Sure, just a minute
 deepak_	I'm confused on where to make actually
 arianepaola	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues
 deepak_	No, I get make: *** No rule to make target 'all'.  Stop. if I give make -j5 all in the build folder
@lambday	deepak_: just run "make -j5"
 deepak_	make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
 deepak_	This is what I get
 deepak_	lambday : I went to the parent folder and ran make -j5 and I get
 deepak_	https://gist.github.com/deepakkandasamy/12f85269a5e4073f634f8dfc91e38219
 deepak_	Damn I have been sitting with this install for 12 hours now xD
@lambday	deepak_: why parent folder? your makefile is generated inside the build folder, right?
 deepak_	It isn't
@lambday	where did you run your cmake cmd?
 deepak_	Did I make some mistake while doing cmake?
 deepak_	In build
@lambday	and the Makefile is not there?
@lambday	after you run cmake?
 deepak_	-- Build files have been written to: /home/deepak/shogun
@lambday	deepak_: that's not your build dir
 deepak_	and not shogun/build for some reason
@lambday	deepak_: recheck.. maybe you're doing something wrong :P
@lambday	Build files have been written to: /home/lambday/Downloads/shogun/build
 deepak_	the cmd is cmake .. right?
@lambday	deepak_: yep
 deepak_	Then why do my make files go to the parent folder?  :(

 deepak_	done
 arianepaola	deepak_: thanks. could you also add your system info?
 arianepaola	and mention that you used the code from git
 sanuj	lambday, there?
 sanuj	HeikoS, there?
@lambday	sanuj: yo
 sanuj	lambday, i have a c++ question :)
@HeikoS	sanuj: jojo
@lambday	sanuj: shoot :)
 sanuj	i have a struct in SGObject
 sanuj	in that struct i want to use get_name() of SGObject
 sanuj	lambday, how to do it
 sanuj	i found something about lambda functions on the web for this
 sanuj	but don't know exactly how lambda functions help
 sanuj	HeikoS, hey :)
@lambday	sanuj: you want to call a method from the owner?
 sanuj	HeikoS, this is ready https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3227
@lambday	sanuj: I usually keep a back-ptr
@lambday	"owner"
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	sanuj: will check later
@HeikoS	gotta leave very soon
 sanuj	HeikoS, sure
 sanuj	lambday, so i pass a pointer to SGObject i.e. this in the struct's constructor?
 sanuj	"this"
@lambday	sanuj: yeah.. that should do it, right?
 sanuj	lambday, okay, i'll try
@lambday	should also be const
@lambday	never modify that ptr
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	lambday, and what kind of pointer
 sanuj	simple c++ or unique_ptr, shared_ptr etc?
@lambday	sanuj: lol but then you can only call methods that are const.. is get_name const?
@lambday	sanuj: simple ptr should do
@lambday	it doesn't modify the life-time of that ptr
 deepak_	arianepaola : I updated it
 sanuj	lambday, get_name is pure virtual const
 sanuj	so will work
@lambday	sanuj: awesome then! :D
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	let me try first :P
@lambday	deepak_: did your problem get resolved?
 deepak_	No , not really
 deepak_	Is installing it  really this tough for everyone here?
@lambday	deepak_: not that tough
@lambday	deepak_: I wonder why your makefile is not inside build
@lambday	if you run the cmake cmd from inside build dir, the generated Makefile should also be inside the build dir
@lambday	OXPHOS: hola
@lambday	OXPHOS: checking your PR :)
 sanuj	OXPHOS, !!!
 OXPHOS	lambday: thx!
 OXPHOS	sanuj: ...
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	OXPHOS, hi
 sanuj	i need to show you my tags PR
 sanuj	let me get the link
 OXPHOS	sanuj: sure..?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, this is how tags look in shogun https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3221/files#diff-8cfacc7a0d1355252c12528031d690b5R315
 sanuj	i'm supposed to tell you about this
 sanuj	OXPHOS, for serialization
 deepak_	lambday: When I build from shogun-4.1.0, my makefiles are inside build
 deepak_	But for the git code it goes to the parent folder
 sanuj	OXPHOS, have you read sergey's design draft for tags / parameters?
 deepak_	No idea why
 OXPHOS	sanuj: cool! thx so much
 OXPHOS	sanuj: nop
@lambday	deepak_: shouldn't be :)
 OXPHOS	sanuj: kinda slow :/
@lambday	deepak_: maybe recheck a bit?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, no problem :)
@lambday	deepak_: are you sure you're compiling from develop branch?
 OXPHOS	sanuj: can you show me where I can find it?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, tags will be merged in shogun by the end of this week or next week
 sanuj	OXPHOS, yes...getting it
 deepak_	lambday, develop branch?
@lambday	deepak_: for the latest git code I mean
@lambday	deepak_: yeah
 deepak_	Yup
 sanuj	OXPHOS, here it is: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/New-parameters-framework-and-plugins
 OXPHOS	sanuj: thanks!
-!- leagoetz [~leagoetz@nat-204-119.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 sanuj	lambday, each time i change SGObject.h
 sanuj	whole shogun code has to be rebuilt
 sanuj	which is kinda slow :/
 OXPHOS	sanuj: may I ask whether I need to inherit CSGObject to use SG_ERROR?
 arianepaola	sanuj: ccache and ninja?
@lambday	sanuj: haha of course..
 sanuj	arianepaola, that makes it fast?
 OXPHOS	sanuj: I included #include <shogun/io/SGIO.h> and it doesn't work
 sanuj	i'll use it then
 sanuj	OXPHOS, you can try SG_SERROR also
 arianepaola	it will cache and reuse object files of unmodified sources
 arianepaola	on Ubuntu, packages are: ccache ninja-build
 sanuj	OXPHOS, if it does not inherit CSGObject then use SGS_ERROR
 arianepaola	cmake -GNinja -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DPythonModular=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="./install" ..
 OXPHOS	sanuj: thx! it worked!
 deepak_	arianepaola  is it ok?
 arianepaola	ninja GoogleMock && ninja all && ninja install && ninja test
 sanuj	arianepaola, cool! i'll do this :)
 arianepaola	deepak_: sure, thanks for the updated info
@lambday	OXPHOS: hey.. checked your updated PR.. it works now, right?
 arianepaola	sanuj: if you use fedora, the command is ninja-build
 deepak_	You're welcome arianepaola
@lambday	OXPHOS: I added some minor comments
 OXPHOS	lambday: yes. thanks for that! may i ask why we need to move template methods to .cpp?
 arianepaola	sanuj: the first time it is as slow as normal :-)
 sanuj	haha, never mind ;)
 arianepaola	sanuj: basically it is if you leave out the options: cmake -GNinja .. && ninja
@lambday	OXPHOS: so that if you change the implementation later, other files doesn't need to be recompiled that includes that header
 deepak_	lambday, even if I build from the parent directory it is supposed to work right?
 arianepaola	also ninja automatically adjusts the build settings according to the number of cpus and cores available
 OXPHOS	lambday: I see. How about the GPU dot method? Is this the correct way or it has to be wrapped?
 sanuj	arianepaola, i'll make a new build and use these flags
 sanuj	arianepaola, no need for "-j4"
 sanuj	like make -j4?
 arianepaola	nope :-)
 sanuj	sounds good
 arianepaola	check the description at https://ninja-build.org/
@lambday	OXPHOS: looks fine to me...
@lambday	OXPHOS: just make the GPUBackend a friend class.. so that it can access the ptr, even though it is not public in GPUVector
@lambday	OXPHOS: or actually, it's fine to keep it public
@lambday	these are all internal
 sanuj	arianepaola, yes, thanks :)
@lambday	nobody is gonna do anything nasty with these
 OXPHOS	lambday: XD friend may look nicer
 arianepaola	sanuj: :-)
@lambday	OXPHOS: well, anything is fine..
@lambday	OXPHOS: doesn't have to force data hiding if it's not really needed :D
@lambday	OXPHOS: but friendship is useful sometimes
@lambday	OXPHOS: well, so the thing is - this refactoring works
@lambday	:)
@lambday	and with opaque ptrs
@lambday	right?
 OXPHOS	lambday: positive!
@lambday	OXPHOS: roger
@lambday	OXPHOS: so next steps:
@lambday	1. make linalg a singleton.. there should be just one instance of this class.. (let's call it Linalg instead of LinalgRefactor).. we'll create one instance of it in init_shogun()..
@lambday	the global instance would be like sg_linalg
@lambday	2. figure out how to register backends..
 OXPHOS	okay
@lambday	3. check how slow it is compared to using dot directly

@lambday	deepak_: it still complains about hdf5?
 deepak_	lambday, I was not able to make it
@lambday	deepak_: how were you able to make it last time, when you didn't turn off hdf5?
@lambday	maybe follow the same steps?
 deepak_	lambday, I'll check it out
@lambday	deepak_: it shouldn't be that hard :|
@lambday	at least it is not supposed to be
 deepak_	lambday, I can only make without errors when USE_HDF5 is set to ON

 deepak_	yes
@lambday	arianepaola: can you please check once whether using HDF5 is **REQUIRED** ?
@lambday	if so, it's a bug
@lambday	also, I wonder why it didn't find your libhdf5-dev things when you already installed it

@lambday	I am sure (b) is solvable
@lambday	deepak_: I'll try a bit later in my machine
 deepak_	lambday
 deepak_	lambday : So, there's nothing I can do now?

 deepak_	lambday ^
@lambday	deepak_: did you link against the libhdf5 as well?

@lambday	deepak_: what's the *.so name for the lib?
@lambday	deepak_: just google a bit :)
@lambday	usually it is -l<name> when the library name is lib<name>.so
 deepak_	libhdf5.so.10
@lambday	deepak_: there has to be a soft link to that, libhdf5.so
 deepak_	lambday :yes,there is one

@lambday	that's where it is instlaled
 deepak_	lambday /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5
@lambday	deepak_: that's non-standard..
 deepak_	So I link it using -L ?
@lambday	deepak_: yes
@lambday	deepak_: that's why shogun cmake didn't find it! :)
 deepak_	wait, it just contains links to another folder
 deepak_	lambday, is this standard? /usr/include/hdf5/serial
@lambday	deepak_: usually /usr/include or /usr/local/include are standard
@lambday	deepak_: anything else, you need to specify
@lambday	deepak_: I'd suggest that you create symbolic links to your libhdf5 in those standard dirs

 deepak_	Oh ok
@lambday	doesn't matter, it works from whereever you install it
@lambday	just create a symlink for that lib in a standard location, run cmake and make

 deepak_	OK
@lambday	and make sure you remove your old cmake junks before you rerun cmake
