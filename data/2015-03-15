 xAndreLopesx	How should i input an audio to a neural network?
 xAndreLopesx	i read the audio as a byte array....
 xAndreLopesx	but the array length is now at 11000~~
 xAndreLopesx	should be 1 input neuron to each index? :O

@lisitsyn	xAndreLopesx: you'd better use convolutions for audio
 xAndreLopesx	hmm
@lisitsyn	xAndreLopesx: usual approach is to use convolutions on top of mel spectrum
 xAndreLopesx	mel spectrum?
@lisitsyn	xAndreLopesx: yeah some spectral transformation
 xAndreLopesx	ah i see
 xAndreLopesx	i will do that then :P
 xAndreLopesx	i was thinking on kohonen map
@lisitsyn	no idea if they work
 xAndreLopesx	maybe not
 xAndreLopesx	so for every nn i shoukld make a spectrum transformation
 xAndreLopesx	or just for CNN's?
@lisitsyn	hmm well they are better features as far as I know
@lisitsyn	even if you don't use convolutions
@lisitsyn	but with convolutions it is even better :)
 xAndreLopesx	okiday
 xAndreLopesx	Do you know what kind of spectrum should i research?
 xAndreLopesx	for a beginner lol
