 heiko1	blackburn around?
 blackburn	heiko1: hey, yes
 heiko1	I have another problem with c++ (many these days)
 heiko1	I want to make a subclass of a templated class
 heiko1	in particular, subclass of CSTreamingDeanseFeatures<T>
 heiko1	template <class T>
 heiko1	class CStreamingDenseDataGenerator: public CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>
 heiko1	but that doesnt work
 heiko1	a) I cannot access members of CStreamingDenseFeatures in methods of CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<T>
 heiko1	b) shogun doesnt recognise the new class as generic so compiling class_list.cpp fails
 heiko1	any ideas?
 heiko1	blackburn, weird problem
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	yeah pretty weird
 heiko1	man no idea  :)(
 heiko1	:(
-!- ptizoom [55d25a64@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.210.90.100] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko1: about a) - does it compile?
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	only b) fails to compile
 heiko1	oh sorry
 heiko1	no
 heiko1	complains that the member elements are not known
 heiko1	ah but I can avoid this using
 heiko1	CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<T>::member_name
 heiko1	still b)
 heiko1	in class list, generic classes are instanciated via this switch thing
 heiko1	that is automatically generated for generic classes
 heiko1	but for this subclass, htis doesnt happen
 blackburn	did you instantiate your new class?
 blackburn	in cpp
 ptizoom	hi, I am looking into associating PDL and Shogun (by replacing numpy). I am progressing slowly...I have some framework (which is not yet compiling), but is it possible to have a development git-branch ?
 blackburn	ptizoom: I am unsure I got what you mean
 blackburn	dev git branch of shogun?
 ptizoom	blackburn: is shogun under the git?
 blackburn	well, yes
 blackburn	but you may commit everything you want in your fork
 heiko1	blackburn, how do you mean that?
 ptizoom	is it easy to get a writting branch from the project?
 heiko1	ptizoom, that takes a while, but as blackburn said, you can just push everything into your fork and then send pull-requests. We then review these, give feedback, and evtl. merge
 heiko1	blackburn, its an error in the class_list.py script
 heiko1	I tuned it manually and now it compiles
 blackburn	ptizoom: yeah pretty easy
 blackburn	ah heiko1 answered
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	heiko1: how does class_list.py check whether it is a template?
 heiko1	blackburn, currently checking
 ptizoom	heiko1: cool
 heiko1	blackburn, is there any problem with subclassing templated classes?
 heiko1	I not get weird errors
 heiko1	for example when trying to create an instance I get
 heiko1	undefined reference to `shogun::CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<double>::CStreamingDenseDataGenerator()'
 heiko1	which is totally weird since the definition is there
 heiko1	why is c++ alway such a horror when it comes to certain things
 blackburn	heh
 heiko1	this is so annoying, I am wasting my time with this stupid stuff where all I want is a generic subclass
 heiko1	cant be that difficult
 blackburn	so it fails to find implementation?
 heiko1	iyes
 blackburn	can you paste the code somewhere?
 heiko1	yes, will do
 heiko1	http://pastebin.com/QSqaGBte
 heiko1	http://pastebin.com/FRCFrbMc
 heiko1	first error you get should be class_list.cpp
 heiko1	I think its related to pure virtual functions
 heiko1	and that inheritance of templated classes doesn not give superclasses elements
 heiko1	(which would explain the pure virtual methods and the non-accessability of superclass members)
 heiko1	blackburn, any ideas?
 blackburn	a minute
 heiko1	blackburn, leaving now, if you would find something that was amazing :)
 blackburn	heiko1: sorry got distracted
 heiko1	no worries
 blackburn	let me check now, I'll let you know
 heiko1	cool, thx
 heiko1	ill check back in 15 mins in case something is missing to test it
 blackburn	heiko1: I think you have to instantiate using
 blackburn	template class CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<bool>;
 blackburn	etc
 blackburn	in .cpp
 blackburn	see DenseFeatures.cpp for example
-!- audy [~audy@heyaudy.com] has quit [Changing host]
-!- audy [~audy@unaffiliated/audy] has joined #shogun
 heiko1	blackburn, no that doesnt work
 heiko1	have you tried it?
 heiko1	blackburn, compiler complains about non-pure virtual methods
 blackburn	hmm do you have some pure virtual methodds around?
 blackburn	I can't see any
 heiko1	no
-!- zxtx [~zv@cpe-75-83-151-252.socal.res.rr.com] has joined #shogun
 heiko1	it complains about all the pure virtual methods from CStreamingFetaures that are imeplemented in CStreamingDenseFeatures
 heiko1	but these are for some reason not visible in the subclass
 blackburn	heiko1: did you try forward declaration of streaming dense feats?
 heiko1	blackburn, what is that?
 blackburn	template <class ST> class CStreamingDenseFeatures;
 blackburn	before definition in *.h
 heiko1	ah sorry ok, Ill try
 blackburn	yeah C++ is pain..
 heiko1	blackburn, no doesnt change anything
 blackburn	damn
 heiko1	but makes sense since the header is included above
 heiko1	yeah man, c++ and OO is so annoying sometimes
 heiko1	no interfaces, no generics
 heiko1	I need these all the time :D
 heiko1	blackburn, Ill update the listings, have you tried to compile them?
 blackburn	no, not yet
 blackburn	let me try then
 heiko1	would be nice ofyou
 blackburn	base/class_list.cpp:414:103: error: expected type-specifier before 'CStreamingDenseDataGenerator'
 blackburn	is that you get?
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	you can get around that
 heiko1	via searching for CStreamingDenseDataGenerator in class_list.cpp
 heiko1	and then cut the line and replace it by a block that is similar to the other templated classes, e.g. CDenseFeatures
 heiko1	with a switch over the types
 blackburn	heh yeah but we should rather fix class_list thing
 heiko1	no
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cG7ZVBXQII&feature=player_detailpage watch that video meanwhile
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	it doesnt solve the problem untimately
 heiko1	cut the line
 heiko1	static CSGObject* __new_CStreamingDenseDataGenerator(EPrimitiveType g) { return g == PT_NOT_GENERIC? new CStreamingDenseDataGenerator(): NULL; }
 heiko1	and replace it by a block that you can find from line 753 ...
 heiko1	lol the video is great .)
 blackburn	but why does it treat your class as not templated?
 heiko1	I think its because of the templates doing something wrong
 heiko1	blackburn, there is another problem even before the class_list
 heiko1	if you add
 heiko1	template class CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<bool>; in the last line of the .cpp file
 heiko1	it doesnt compile already
 blackburn	lol! you've got to make it one line
 heiko1	due to these pure virtual function
 heiko1	?
 blackburn	 32 template <class T> class CStreamingDenseDataGenerator: public CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>
 blackburn	this way
 blackburn	not two liner
 blackburn	class_list solved then
 heiko1	what???
 heiko1	argh
 blackburn	okay lets get to undefined reference problem
 heiko1	since python is line based
 blackburn	not a python but the class_list.cpp.py thing
 heiko1	do you now also get the undefined references?
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko1	These can be solved by adding the lines
 blackburn	work work sleep then work
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	template class CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<bool>;
 heiko1	etc
 heiko1	but then another error appears
 blackburn	okay let me get to next error in our funny journey
 heiko1	what do you think of this one?
 blackburn	features/StreamingDenseDataGenerator.cpp:16:35: error: type 'shogun::CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<bool>' is not a direct base of 'shogun::CStreamingDenseDataGenerator<bool>'
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	that
 blackburn	hhhaha
 blackburn	okay do not blame C++, it is you :)
 blackburn	check your constructor carefully
 blackburn	you kinda calling it itself again
 blackburn	however other errors stay :D
 heiko1	aaaa
 heiko1	no
 heiko1	i already fixed the others
 heiko1	copy paste -.-
 blackburn	hehe
 heiko1	man
 heiko1	thanks a lot
 heiko1	guess i have been starring to the monitor too much
 blackburn	lets dance north korean style
 blackburn	kim jong style
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	would never have found this
 heiko1	yeah, go :D
 heiko1	yep works now
 blackburn	I absolutely love this country btw, would love to visit they
 blackburn	but too scary
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	why do you love it?
 blackburn	it is like they freezed soviet union in 60s
 blackburn	so funny and crazy
 heiko1	soyou like that retroish style :)
 heiko1	you should get a lomography camera then :)
 blackburn	hah one friend of mine has a few
 heiko1	http://microsites.lomography.com/stores/gallery-stores/east-london
 heiko1	my girlfriend has a a few
 heiko1	they make cool phoos
 heiko1	tos
 blackburn	his photos look like this: http://cs9220.userapi.com/u596778/146498181/z_8d525488.jpg
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	ohoh
 heiko1	there are more errors
 heiko1	warnings:
 heiko1	inline-Funktion >>shogun::EFeatureType shogun::CStreamingDenseFeatures<T>::get_feature_type() const [with T = long double]<< verwendet, aber nirgendwo definiert
 heiko1	bla used but not defined
 blackburn	hahahha
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	that's why you didn't paste
 blackburn	errors
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	and these are exactly the pure virtual methods that are imeplemented in CStreamingDenseFeatures
 heiko1	you got it :)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	aber nirgendwo definiert!
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	thats: but nowhere defined :)
 blackburn	I know only what GmbH is
 blackburn	gesselschaft mit beschraenkter haftung!
 heiko1	what is also strange: have a look at CStreamingDenseFeatures
 blackburn	obschestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennostyu
 heiko1	there is an element current_sgvector
 blackburn	not that shorter in russian, lol
 heiko1	but I cannot access that from my new class, compile error
 heiko1	Russion looks mess
 heiko1	y
 heiko1	and its beschr?????nkter )
 blackburn	yeah, I thought ae works too
 heiko1	yeah it does
 blackburn	lets see updated code then
 heiko1	I will create another pastebin
 blackburn	heiko1: btw I am now developing the ideal machine learning environment (TM)
 heiko1	http://pastebin.com/JiM2S6vU
 blackburn	check one idea
 heiko1	http://pastebin.com/mMhQVMtG
 heiko1	Ill check
 blackburn	heiko1: https://gist.github.com/3795078
 heiko1	btw I renamed the variable to current_vector in my code-base
 blackburn	briefly - all the things that happen to 'context' variables are going to be serialized
 blackburn	but that's all transparent and you don't care about that
 heiko1	but thats python only or?
 blackburn	yeah sure
 blackburn	such madness can't happen in any normal language
 heiko1	:)
 blackburn	do you like the idea?
 blackburn	my other extension is
 blackburn	with operation('reading files') as context:context.train_data = numpy.loadtxt('train.csv',delimiter=",",skiprows=1)context.test_data = numpy.loadtxt('test.csv',delimiter=",",skiprows=1)
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	with operation('reading files') as context:
 blackburn	context.train_data = numpy.loadtxt('train.csv',delimiter=",",skiprows=1)
 blackburn	context.test_data = numpy.loadtxt('test.csv',delimiter=",",skiprows=1)
 blackburn	context.train_data is going to be saved and then serialized to file
 blackburn	after with block
 blackburn	I am thinking about a way to load it from serialized automatically as well
 heiko1	yeah I mean, thats all the magic of pickle
 heiko1	nice, like it
 blackburn	yes, it is easy
 blackburn	the thing I am trying to reach
 heiko1	though its not really shogun-ish since only works in one binding
 blackburn	is transparency of such operations like measuring time
 blackburn	or serialization
 heiko1	transparency?
 blackburn	or rather implicit way
 blackburn	I mean I want to save everything without calling anything
 heiko1	yeah, thats great use
 blackburn	have you seen patterns for ML article?
 heiko1	no
 heiko1	where ?
 blackburn	http://arkitus.com/PRML/
 heiko1	doing that all the time anyway :)
 blackburn	yes, thats the spirit
 blackburn	features/streaming/StreamingDenseDataGenerator.cpp:75:68: error: invalid conversion from 'const char*' to 'int32_t {aka int}' [-fpermissive]
 blackburn	../shogun/base/Parameter.h:206:21: error:   initializing argument 1 of 'shogun::TParameter* shogun::Parameter::get_parameter(int32_t)' [-fpermis
 blackburn	that's what I get
 heiko1	ah year
 heiko1	I added stuff
 heiko1	wait, I will push that quicklly
 blackburn	heiko1: btw are you using vim?
 heiko1	no, why?
 blackburn	just curious
 blackburn	I argue with my team lead at job every day :D
 heiko1	blackburn, you can just comment that line  75
 blackburn	I am a vim guy, he says sth like GUI rocks
 heiko1	no I actually use eclipse
 heiko1	like browsing around in the code by mouse
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	looks like it appears to compile then
 heiko1	yeah
 heiko1	but change something and compile again:
 heiko1	warnings
 blackburn	yeah, I get quite a lot warnings
 heiko1	these are strange
 heiko1	because the methods are all implemented in superclass
 heiko1	(in fact, thats why I derived)
 blackburn	probably we have some other glitch around there
 blackburn	gangnam style!
 blackburn	woop woop woop woop
 heiko1	?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko1	code works apart from these warnings btw :)
 blackburn	can't see nothing wrong
 blackburn	walking kim jong style
 heiko1	:D

 n4nd0	haha why?
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cG7ZVBXQII&feature=player_detailpage
 n4nd0	blackburn: any news about your interview?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, nothing yet
 blackburn	they have to come up with a reject message :D
 n4nd0	I bet you don't believe that ;)
 blackburn	no I really believe I am not that cool :)

 wiking	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	wiking: how is it going using the SO framework?
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you know if the post-gsoc post came eventually to life?
 n4nd0	post-gsoc post haha
 n4nd0	funny name
 blackburn	you mean t-shirt thing?
 blackburn	iirc it should arrive before 30th
 n4nd0	no no
 n4nd0	the post
 n4nd0	sonney2k asked for help for a post and I sent him by mail one
 n4nd0	a couple of weeks ago he said he'd started fixing it
 wiking	n4nd0: i've got convergence with bmrm
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	well no idea
 n4nd0	wiking: really? I think you should actually get the same solution as with PrimalMosek
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	my problem is/was really the memory consumption
 wiking	of mosek
 n4nd0	oh sorry I misunderstood. for some strange reason I thought I read that it didn't converge with bmrm
 n4nd0	I don't know if I screw sth up with my code using mosek
