 KMM_User	hello
 KMM_User	I have a problem with using kernel mean matching using the python_modular interface
 KMM_User	the resulting weights are always binary, in the sense that one weight is 1.0 and all others are 0.0
 KMM_User	this sparse behaviour is not what I expected. can I change it in any way, or might I be doing something wrong?
 KMM_User	it also happens with the example statistics_kmm.py
 KMM_User	but I have not checked yet whether this is also the behaviour of the "native" C++ version
 KMM_User	any hints to become "un-sparse" are welcome :)

 KMM_User	hello kislay
 kislay	hi
 KMM_User	do you know whether it's intended that the KernelMeanMatching function produces a sparse output?
 KMM_User	at least it does for me, using the python interface
 KMM_User	(modular)
 kislay	KMM_User, sorry. I have no idea. :(
 KMM_User	OK, thank you anyway!

@wiking	thoralf: you did this?! :)
@wiking	thoralf: you haven't answered my concerns
@wiking	about SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
@wiking	:)
 thoralf	Sorry, I missed that.
 thoralf	Your concerns are what exactly?
@wiking	so basically what you did in the model file for coverity
@wiking	void SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED(...) { }
@wiking	void SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED(...) {.... }
@wiking	we never call SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED with a function argument
@wiking	it's just
@wiking	SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
 thoralf	I know, that was also my concern.
 thoralf	I thought you suggested me to do it.
@wiking	no i have not
 thoralf	lol
@wiking	you've changed yourself the model file
@wiking	:D
 thoralf	Yes, I changed the model file, but I told you.
 thoralf	Hmm.
@wiking	yeah you told me
@wiking	but you've changed it in a way
@wiking	that it has nothing do with what is being used in shgun
@wiking	*shogun
@wiking	i've tried a hack though
@wiking	but that didn't do the trick
@wiking	so what i did for coverity analysis in it's config file was the following
@wiking	#undef SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
@wiking	#define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED()
@wiking	but this is actually fucking wrong :)
 thoralf	Looks strange.  Does this even compile? ;)
@wiking	yeah it has this error
@wiking	/home/buildslave/cov-analysis-linux64-7.0.2/config/template-g++-config-0/../user_nodefs.h", line 40: error #90:
@wiking	          function returning function is not allowed
@wiking	  extern void SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED();
@wiking	but yeah what i'm about to say is that maybe
@wiking	this could do the trick
@wiking	#undef SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
@wiking	#define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED sg_notimplemented()
@wiking	extern void sg_notimplemented();
 thoralf	Why not #define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED __coverity_panic__()
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	could do that
@wiking	but this was the way coverity suggested
@wiking	basically for SG_*ERROR(...) i did this
@wiking	#nodef SG_ERROR
@wiking	#nodef SG_SERROR
@wiking	extern void SG_ERROR(...);
@wiking	extern void SG_SERROR(...);
@wiking	and then in the model file i did the panic part
@wiking	i mean i don't know if actually the coverity c++ compiler has the definition for __coverity_panic__()
@wiking	maybe there's a good reason why you have to put the __coverity*() functions in the model file
 thoralf	However, sorry for destroying one analysis run.
 thoralf	I need to leave; I'm already a bit late.
@wiking	ok ok no worries
@wiking	do you think that above thing could work?
@wiking	i mean gcc/g++ is not case-insensitive
@wiking	#define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED sg_notimplemented() should not be like an infinite loop of macros
@wiking	or/
@wiking	?
@wiking	ok i'll change the model file and force a new build
@wiking	let's see :)))
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: force build --branch=develop 'coverity analysis'
 shogun-buildbot	The build has been queued, I'll give a shout when it starts
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 thoralf	wiking: Yeah, #define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED sg_notimplemented() could work.  But since macros is just string manipulation (almost), do we need to add an ";" to the end?
 thoralf	Because SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED is always called without ";"
 thoralf	May yield compiler/parser errors if the ";" is missing.
@wiking	thoralf: shit yeah
@wiking	:)
@wiking	thoralf: good thing that the analysis hasn't started yet so i've managed to change the macro
