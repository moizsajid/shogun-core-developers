 wiking	blackburn: yo
 blackburn	wiking: hey! how are you?
 wiking	blackburn: sorry i haven't seen your message on time the other day
 blackburn	ah we are all busy nevermind :)
 wiking	yeah i'm recovering now from my wedding :)
 wiking	but now i'm more or less back
 blackburn	oh so we are congratulating you?
 blackburn	:)
 wiking	have u seen michal around lately?
 wiking	yeye :)))
 blackburn	no he rather disappear
 wiking	:(
 blackburn	is it your first time? :)
 wiking	hehehe first and last i hope
 wiking	i have some problems with the dualsolver
 wiking	maybe i should email him :S
 blackburn	bmrm?
 wiking	yeps
 blackburn	what's wrong?
 wiking	well
 wiking	the whole thing starts with w = 0
 wiking	and basically when i give it a problem to solve
 wiking	it doesn't converge to anywhere :(
 wiking	w is zero
 wiking	and after 2 iteration the whole thing stops
 blackburn	did you tune lambda?
 wiking	haven't touched yet that
 wiking	but then again
 wiking	it's weird
 blackburn	oh that's the reason then
 wiking	mmm let me try
 wiking	do u have a good lambda?
 blackburn	no idea, just try some small/large
 blackburn	the reason you get w=0 is that you overregularize that
 blackburn	so the algorithm prefers w=0 rather than avoid any errors on train set
 wiking	lemme check what was the lambda
 wiking	ok so lambda =  0.100000 is not good
 wiking	i'll try now with 10
 blackburn	lambda is 1/C for svms
 blackburn	IIRC
 wiking	yeps
 blackburn	no idea if #count counts here as well
 wiking	ok so neither 0.001 nor 10.0 does anything
 blackburn	try some extreme values like 1e-10 and 10e10
 wiking	i think i still have some other problem
 wiking	basically w keeps being 0
 blackburn	what is the model?
 wiking	ok lemme copy-paste the risk function
 wiking	\lambda||\mathbf{w}||^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \max_{(\hat{y},\hat{h}) \in YxH} \left[ \mathbf{w}  \cdot \Psi(x_i, \hat{y}, \hat{h})+\Delta(y_i, \hat{y}, \hat{h}) \right ] \right )  - \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{w} \cdot \Psi(x_i, y_i, h^*_i)
 wiking	put it here for easy reading
 wiking	http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php
 blackburn	so latent thing again :)
 wiking	basically the last term is = 0 because of w=0
 wiking	and the 2nd term is -245
 wiking	and that's it
 wiking	it doesn't move anywhere
 blackburn	can you paste  the thing BMRM output?
 wiking	[DEBUG] risk: -245.000000 0.000000 0: tim=0.545, Fp=-245.000000, Fd=-inf, R=-245.000000
 wiking	[DEBUG] risk: -245.000000 0.000000 1: tim=0.550, Fp=-245.000000, Fd=-0.000000, (Fp-Fd)=-245.000000, (Fp-Fd)/Fp=1.000000, R=-245.000000, nCP=1, nzA=0, QPexitflag=1
 blackburn	I find that confusing to have exactly 245.0
 wiking	it's because of \Delta(y_i, \hat{y}, \hat{h})
 wiking	buuuut
 wiking	i think i'm stupid :))))
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	ah it is hamming-like?
 blackburn	I see
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but
 wiking	i did
 wiking	w*psi - delta
 wiking	instead of
 wiking	w*psi + delta
 wiking	in the 2nd term
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	dunno why
 blackburn	try brand new thing then :)
 wiking	trying with 0.01 lambda
 wiking	hahahah much better
 wiking	it's already at the 42th iteration
 wiking	55
 wiking	and counting
 blackburn	lets hope it converge
 wiking	well now fp went down to 8
 wiking	from 245.000000
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	wiking: so something promising now?
 wiking	iteration 450 ;)
 blackburn	ehh what's dual gap?
 wiking	 489: tim=1.278, Fp=2.828893, Fd=2.449111, (Fp-Fd)=0.379781, (Fp-Fd)/Fp=0.134251, R=0.379781, nCP=223, nzA=214, QPexitflag=1
 blackburn	uh
 blackburn	tight
 wiking	ok maybe i should change lambda
 blackburn	wiking: I expect either problem is hard to solve or you've got hard to solve parameters

 wiking	wtf
 wiking	this shit took about 7gigs of ram
 blackburn	wow
 wiking	yeah i think i should valgrind the shit out of it ;)
 CIA-31	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * re0a93ad / (3 files in 2 dirs): A few more stringfeatures improvements - http://git.io/bHbEEA
 wiking	yey i was leaking
 wiking	and am still but not that much at least
 blackburn	wiking: what is leaking?
 blackburn	your code?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	mmm when should this converge...ever? :)
 blackburn	should converge in 200-300 iters in a normal way
 blackburn	as I believe I mean
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	that's all a bit strange
 wiking	yeah i'm at iter 900
 wiking	trying with different lambda
 wiking	blackburn: something for reading: http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.197 :)
 blackburn	pdf unavailable heh
 wiking	mmm
 blackburn	I guess you've got some university access for that?
 wiking	haven't tried
 wiking	i've just read the abstract ;)
 wiking	i'll check it
 blackburn	wiking: I'm now attacking stereo matchin' problem
 wiking	hiih
 blackburn	surprisingly that's kind of hard to be real-time thing
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	but I have to make it realtime
 wiking	oh bmrm why u no converge!
 blackburn	bmrm can haz converge I am sure :)
 wiking	yeah i think i need something like this
 wiking	but with bmrm
 wiking	http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/9090678.jpg
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	so risk is decreasing and decreasing?
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	and decreasing once again
 wiking	yeah indeed it does
 wiking	0.168798
 wiking	this is the risk atm :D
 blackburn	how much it decreases iteration by iteration?
 wiking	0.01
 blackburn	hmm
 wiking	it's basically moving around 0.15-0.17
 wiking	for the last 10 iterations
 blackburn	may be you could try wider tolerance?
 blackburn	just to check it converges to something consistent
 wiking	how? which parameter?
 wiking	as now i'm using everything default
 wiking	except lambda
 blackburn	lemme check
 wiking	lambda is 0.01
 blackburn	wiking: is your class built on top of dual lib qp bm so svm?
 wiking	sortof
 blackburn	set_TolRel
 blackburn	1e-3 by default
 wiking	so i guess 0.1 would be nicer than :)
 blackburn	try that
 wiking	ok doin'
 wiking	ok risk is still going down with 1.0
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	still nada
 wiking	i have like 122 cutting planes
 wiking	the risk is moving between 1.3-1.4

 wiking	oh woah
 wiking	after iter  896: tim=1.641, Fp=2.754775, Fd=2.489348, (Fp-Fd)=0.265427, (Fp-Fd)/Fp=0.096352, R=0.265427, nCP=272, nzA=265, QPexitflag=1
 wiking	it converge
 wiking	d
 blackburn	wiking: anything consistent or?
