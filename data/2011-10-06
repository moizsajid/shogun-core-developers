 naywhayare	hello there, I have a pretty simple usage of Shogun I am struggling with
 naywhayare	I am trying to use the command line interface to run the k-NN classifier; should be simple enough following this example:
 naywhayare	http://shogun-toolbox.org/trac/browser/examples/cmdline/classifier_knn.sg?rev=d09b1054a2a97d5f110007f371773e694d275c4f
 naywhayare	the difference is, I'm using HDF5 data, and it isn't clear to me how to use set_features with that
 naywhayare	thanks in advance for any help that anyone might be willing to provide... :)
 Guest96150	naywhayare, unfortunately this is not implemented
 naywhayare	ok.  that's no problem.  in that case, I need a utility to convert my .h5 (or csv) data into the .dat format used in that example
 Guest96150	naywhayare, have a look at mldata-utils at mloss.org
 Guest96150	these can be used to convert basically anything to anythin
 naywhayare	ah, ok.  I was confused as to whether or not the "binary" format was standardized
 naywhayare	I've run into a couple different types
 naywhayare	so, I'll use that then
 naywhayare	thank you for the quick help :)
 Guest96150	yeah - sorry that it wasn't the answer we both would have liked
 Guest96150	but we are focussing a lot on developing the swig based modular interfaces currently
 Guest96150	they just provide much more flexibility
 naywhayare	in any software development task the little polished bits are generally of the least importance -- there is still an easy-enough way for me to use Shogun with what I have, so it isn't a problem
 Guest96150	kk
