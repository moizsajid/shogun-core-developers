 deerishi	@iglesiasg: hi
 deerishi	i have implemented the scikit kpca example

@iglesiasg	deerishi: let me see
@iglesiasg	ok
 deerishi	can i do a pull request regarding the kernel pca test check
@iglesiasg	deerishi: it could be maybe somethign to merge in graphical examples
@iglesiasg	something*
@iglesiasg	deerishi: there are some things that look a bit messy in circle_data.py though
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o lisitsyn] by ChanServ
 deerishi	@iglesiasg: could you eleborate a bit more?
@iglesiasg	deerishi: well, just in general the creation of the data
@iglesiasg	you are just creating data or plotting two circunferences, aren't you?
@iglesiasg	that's something like x^2+y^2=r^2
@iglesiasg	I have the intuition that it should be easier to create that data
 deerishi	i am actuaaly creating the data
 deerishi	*actually
 deerishi	i am storing the values of the circle in a 2 dimensional array
 deerishi	then i am concatenating the 2 arrays by hstack for kpca data
@iglesiasg	ok
 deerishi	@iglesiasg : where is the graphical examples folder?
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@nat-182-85.internal.eduroam.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
 deerishi	hello HeikoS
 HeikoS	hi deerishi
 deerishi	i did solve the scikit kpca example
 deerishi	:)
 HeikoS	deerishi: finally :)
 HeikoS	cool
 HeikoS	Ill have a look at the code
 deerishi	https://github.com/deerishi/KernelPCA-test-check/commit/743d3d9bc373aa36b0ea4bb7065ed36ba8706a93
 HeikoS	deerishi: nice, so this makes sense now!
 deerishi	yes!!
 HeikoS	so what I suggest now is that you merge this code into the existing kpca example
 HeikoS	note that input arguments
 HeikoS	there is a list that is used for integration testing
 HeikoS	for the python_modular example, please remove all plotting code and return the transformation matrix and the transformed features and the preprocessor object
 HeikoS	but I would also suggest to add you plotting example under the graphical examples
 HeikoS	since it looks very nice
 HeikoS	please pimp it a bit and then add as graphical example
 HeikoS	if you have questions on the integration tests, let me know
@lisitsyn	something is unhealthy with normalization
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah good that you see that!
 HeikoS	what is it?
@lisitsyn	IIRC kPCA preserves the scale
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: check axes, they are e-10
-!- sijin [~smuxi@144.214.222.109] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
 HeikoS	I dont know
 HeikoS	if kpca does this
 HeikoS	better check
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: kpca with linear is pca
@lisitsyn	or mds
@lisitsyn	they are all the same for linear kernel
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes right its linear kernel
 HeikoS	I forgot
@lisitsyn	so scale should be preserved
 HeikoS	well, then we should see same scalling
@lisitsyn	I am not sure if it is kpca that is wrong
@lisitsyn	but something is wrong for sure
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe we should have a unit test which compares KPCA with PCA
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: haveing this example is good already
 HeikoS	since we can detect these things
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah
 sijin	@lisitsyn, I just found tapkee KPCA and kernel PCA in shogun gives different result
 HeikoS	here we go :)
 wiking	mornin'
 HeikoS	wiking: hi!
 sijin	I project features using Kernel PCA in Shogun, and compare it with the embedding result of tapkee KPCA,
@lisitsyn	sijin ha!
@lisitsyn	sijin: how significant?
@lisitsyn	either of them has a bug haha
 sijin	when target dimension is 1, the difference is 1e-3
 sijin	however, when target_dimension is greater than 1, their ouput looks totally different
@lisitsyn	sijin: could you plot it?
 sijin	you mean printing the result in text?
@lisitsyn	sijin: no, just compare 2d results
 sijin	not yet. I am not familiar with shogun's plot function, any suggestion? or I send you the output of them?
@lisitsyn	sijin: there is no plot function in shogun - what have you used to compare?
 sijin	I just print it output.(I use small matrix for testing)
@lisitsyn	I see
 sijin	can I paste the output here( matrix size = 10x5)?
 wiking	sijin: pastbin

 sijin	Here is the result with target_dim = 2 http://pastebin.com/ffe5m6gU
 sijin	As you can see, the output of shogun kernel pca is consistent. (I mean the output for target_dim ==3 is the "subset" of that of target_dim == 2)
 sijin	sorry, the output with target_dim ==2 is the subset of result with target_dim == 3

 wiking	ok let's see if finally i've managed to get unit testing working on travis...
 wiking	then the only thing that remains is that stupid python_modular error we keep getting...
 wiking	and it should be fixed before gsoc kicks off
 wiking	so that PRs can be safely merged
 wiking	if it's indicated 'good' by travis
 HeikoS	wiking: yes
 HeikoS	very good that the unit-tests are working, great work! :)
@sonney2k	wiking, which one still fails?

 HeikoS	deerishi: nice, will comment/review soon!
 wiking	hahahaha oh
 wiking	i see
@sonney2k	HeikoS, wiking, did someone change anything on labels?
@sonney2k	wi?
 wiking	HeikoS sonney2k http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/369/steps/test/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
 wiking	sonney2k: it fails on nightly as well
 wiking	so this is something unrelated to travis
@sonney2k	wiking, sure it is
 wiking	sonney2k: HeikoS done some changes
@sonney2k	so just find out which version worked last
@sonney2k	and then we have it
@sonney2k	ok friday everything was still fine
 wiking	it started to crash with this commit: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/d30f20557e0282e8bd8580608b8583aa2586b1a7
 wiking	HeikoS: this is your work ;)
 wiking	or let's say it started to crash after this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/d53a8982fa51e129a1e08df11089f8212fca7fa6
 wiking	i reckon it's somewhere here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/65da3fd2646dc13e2d36baaca314c5f7f2e36411

@sonney2k	HeikoS, this
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/demos/gp/entrance
@sonney2k	and then the build bot failure
 wiking	HeikoS: i think you've broken integration test with fixing the labels :S
@sonney2k	see just the few lines above
@sonney2k	seems like
 HeikoS	sonney2k: the GP demo is ultra cool
 HeikoS	now it needs heatmaps for the predictive distribution
 wiking	sonney2k: tweeted ;)
 HeikoS	sonney2k: ah
 HeikoS	I see
 HeikoS	I added a parameter
 HeikoS	register
 HeikoS	did I push this to master or to develop? Currently confused about where the buildbot runs
 wiking	HeikoS: develop
 HeikoS	ok, let me fix it
 wiking	HeikoS: nightly buildbot runs on develop
 HeikoS	wiking: ah ok
@sonney2k	wiking, hmmhh shouldn't the other buildbot also run on develop?
@sonney2k	I thougth we changed that
 wiking	sonney2k: not yet :P
@sonney2k	wiking, nice one with the matrix :)
@sonney2k	wiking, no I think I did

 HeikoS	since I need to tell the thing when the parameter was added but PARAM_VERSION is still at one
 HeikoS	mmh, this stuff was broken, thats why we did not increase, I remember
 HeikoS	at some point this should be fixed, we always break compitability with previous version otherwise when we change classes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, then increase it now

 votjakovr	Looking through the code of GP framework, I don't understand the idea, why base class CLikelihoodModel has a protected field m_df (degrees of freedom)... I think it's better to declare it, where it really needs (for example in CStudentsTLikelihood). What do you think about that?
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: better in what sense?
@iglesiasg	I don't know much about the GP framework we have, so just asking out of curiosity
 wiking	jacob wrote that code... but i haven't seen him around ever since gsoc'12 finished
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: I think that base class should contain properties, which are common for all derived.
 votjakovr	But degrees of freedom aren't used in GaussianLikelihood, for example
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: yeah, that makes sense. But if all the derived classes have some degrees of freedom, doesn't it make sense to have it there? Even if the number of degrees of freedom is different among them
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: aham I see

 vikram360	Hi, I'm just curious to know what the git workflow of some of the veteran shogun developers is.
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: If all derived classes from has degrees of freedom field, I think it's better to have it in base class. But it's not true in our case.
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: ok
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: So, I'd like to remove it from base class and declare in derived. What do you think?
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: how many derived classes are there that use that member?
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: just one
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: then yeah, it could make sense to have it as you are saying

@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: I am now merging the latest code and then you can go
 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: great
 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: also wanted to ask: do you have some method of finding the distance between strings in shogun? I did looked a bit at distance folder, but still not sure
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: the usual way is to use kernel distance
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: simples is exp{-k(x,x')/width}
@lisitsyn	simplest*
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: one may use the hamming distance of course
@lisitsyn	bah! proposals are now accepted
 vgorbati_	:)
 vgorbati_	what about sequence alignment?
 vgorbati_	when we have the penalty for mismatched letter and the penalty for inserting a gap
 vgorbati_	and find the optimal way to insert gaps in both strings
 vgorbati_	then the resulting penalty would be a distance
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: you are talking about some alignment kernel I guess

 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: ok, but how to write this in function specification? Or i can just leave 'setter for perplexity', 'getter for perplexity'?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: yes that's ok
@sonney2k	wiking, yes that is crazy
@sonney2k	it should work yes / no
@sonney2k	wiking, only thing I see we can do is print out the different objects before failing
@sonney2k	vgorbati, yes
 wiking	sonney2k: but what does actually happen in that script?
@sonney2k	vgorbati, where on DNA
@sonney2k	wiking, what do you mean?
@sonney2k	wiking, the big picture?
 wiking	sonney2k: in that exact script
 wiking	lisitsyn: wtf man
 wiking	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/990/files
@sonney2k	wiking, generator.py just runs the different settings
 wiking	lisitsyn: BAD
 wiking	lisitsyn: should not merge!
@sonney2k	it is calling that function in each python script
@lisitsyn	wiking: makefile?
@sonney2k	with all the parameter settings in that script
@sonney2k	for each parameter setting it is just python.pickling the results
 wiking	lisitsyn: see my comment
@sonney2k	then tester.py is doing the same again - and loads the serialized reference data from disk comparing things
 wiking	lisitsyn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/990/files
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/990/files#r3903403
 wiking	lisitsyn: so somebody fix this
@lisitsyn	wiking: I see - I thought it was missed
 wiking	ASAP
 wiking	lisitsyn: it was not
 wiking	who's vladislav-horbatiuk
 wiking	?
 vgorbati_	wiking: are you sure? When I tried it without -I GTEST_DIR ..., it gave me an error: 'gtest/gtest.h' - not found
 wiking	vgorbati_: that was *your* fault
 vgorbati_	wiking: its me
 wiking	vgorbati_: should have checked those variables before doing this patch
 wiking	vgorbati_: r u sure ./configure found your gmock and gtest src?
 wiking	from the configure:
 wiking	COMPFLAGS_GTEST_CPP="-I$GTEST_HEADER_PATH"
 wiking	so i'm pretty sure that it was there
 wiking	and since for everybody else who uses gmock/gtest this was working
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn :develop * f2dae9d / tests/unit/Makefile: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/f2dae9dbaa0b8fbf34b01c5bb53a3108986e4184
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Removed unnecessary compilation include paths
 wiking	i'm pretty sure that there is something wrong at your end
 vgorbati_	wiking: I did not put my gtest/gmock at default paths
@lisitsyn	wiking: alright solved
 wiking	vgorbati_: then you should have told that to the configure script, right?
 wiking	lisitsyn: thnx
 wiking	vgorbati_: ./configure --gmock=... --gtest=...
 wiking	and check what configure's output is actually for gmock and gtest
 wiking	i.e. if it finds it or not
 vgorbati_	wiking: now I get it, sorry for that much text
@lisitsyn	outrageous wiking with an axe is killing people
 gsomix	sonney2k, there? how long are you going to stay in France?
 wiking	sonney2k: ok so am i right if i assume that it fails with this particular serialized model: data/testsuite/tests/serialization_complex_example0.txt?
@sonney2k	gsomix, until wednesday
 wiking	lisitsyn: indeed
@sonney2k	wiking, yes
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok, thanks.
 wiking	sonney2k: mmmhm... i'll try to somehow reproduce this error :S
 wiking	sonney2k: which part of .fr?
@lisitsyn	wiking: he is looking at the eiffel tower
@sonney2k	and if one runs tester.py -d serialization_complex_example.py it would give you a python shell when things deviate
@sonney2k	so you have two variables a  and b then
@sonney2k	which are lists of what got returned
@sonney2k	wiking, the problem is that I cannot reproduce the issue here
@sonney2k	wiking, paris
@sonney2k	yeah I am at this event here
@sonney2k	https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/events/mls2013/default.aspx
 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: theta and perplexity are the only parameters for t-SNE, aren't they?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: yes
@lisitsyn	theta is even not the t-sne but barnes-hut-sne
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: nice event!
 naywhayare	sonney2k: okay, thanks for the info
 wiking	sonney2k: ah cool! although paris i hate :P
@lisitsyn	haha I put russian elections 2011 to the t-SNE
 wiking	lisitsyn: :DDDDDD
 wiking	LOL
 wiking	sonney2k: have u managed to figure out wtf is going on with the buildbots? or no time
@sonney2k	no time and internet connection of this hotel is too unstable
 wiking	heheheh
@lisitsyn	wiking: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10139213/share/elections.png
 wiking	internet in a hotel in .fr is always shiat
 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: I thought theta is basically parameter of all gradient-descend-like methods
@sonney2k	not sure if there is some boring session tomorrow - then I would fix it
 wiking	lisitsyn: that's a brain? :DDD
@lisitsyn	wiking: usual picture for t-sne
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: yes, theta=0 is t-sne
@lisitsyn	theta \ne 0 is barnes-hut
 vgorbati_	so for t-SNE there's only one parameter - perplexity?
 vgorbati_	ah, we are actually using 'barnes-hut' in the end, so theta is used
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: yes for pure t-sne only perplexity matters
@lisitsyn	it is kind of exact
 vgorbati_	lisitsyn: ok, going to sleep now, hope will finish it by tomorrow
@lisitsyn	vgorbati_: alright

 van51	hello all
@iglesiasg	hey van51
 van51	i am trying to tackle an entry task
 van51	can you tell if it is possible to do a partial build?
 van51	and if yes, how?
@iglesiasg	van51: what do you mean with a partial build_
@iglesiasg	not to build all shogun modules_
@iglesiasg	_ -> ?
 van51	yes
 van51	to re-build just the components that I have changed
@iglesiasg	no, unfortunately we have not such an option
@iglesiasg	well, if you are talking about re-building
@iglesiasg	as long as you have not modified headers, make will do that automatically
 van51	oh ok
 van51	I had modified a header last time and that's why it did it all over again I guess
@iglesiasg	if you configure with --disable-optimization
@iglesiasg	it compiles faster too
@iglesiasg	and also using a compiler cache
 van51	nice, good to know!
@iglesiasg	van51: yeah, that's the case when you modify a header
 van51	thanks!
@iglesiasg	van51: I really want to see cmake integration in shogun so we could manage this partial builds nicely
 van51	iglesiasg: I wish I knew what you were talking about :p
 van51	it's my first time "developing" on such a large scale framework
@iglesiasg	hehe :)
@iglesiasg	have you heard of cmake?
 van51	I believe I have used it
@iglesiasg	ok
 van51	but I was just copying commands
@iglesiasg	so the partial buil issue you were talking about
@iglesiasg	can be handled well with cmake
@iglesiasg	see for example PCL (another open source project)
@iglesiasg	what you do there instead of doing a configure
@iglesiasg	you do cmake
@iglesiasg	and that creates the Makefile
@iglesiasg	also you can configure cmake with its cousin ccmake
@iglesiasg	ccmake gets you to a nice ncurses interface
@iglesiasg	and you may be able to choose options, such as the modules you want to build
 van51	I see
 van51	and would it be difficult to make this transition?
@iglesiasg	let's say not easy :)
 van51	hehe
@iglesiasg	I guess one would require to learn some cmake first
 van51	It could be an upcoming project
@iglesiasg	and study shogun structure to some depth
 van51	thank you for the information
@iglesiasg	np :)
