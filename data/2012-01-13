 sonne|work	blackburn: what do you want to do on the website?
 blackburn	sonne|work: it seems I have to have some small homepage of my 'toolkit'
 sonne|work	I can tell that I would prefer to have more of shogun in this kind of style - maybe we should have pages for the big modules similar to what you did
 sonne|work	anyways there is a separate git for that I will give you access to
 blackburn	sonne|work: I have no idea if that's required though
 blackburn	but listing shogun homepage as 'edrt' one looks strange
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw implementing some new toolkit just like mine would be great 'difficult' task for gsoc
 blackburn	for someone talented I guess..
