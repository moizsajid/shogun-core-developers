 lisitsyn	sonney2k: any news?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, for what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: access!
 lisitsyn	nginx!
 lisitsyn	two things
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I need more details please
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: which details?
@sonney2k	because our current setup has like 50 or so instances running
 lisitsyn	whoa
@sonney2k	nginx doing round robin around them
 lisitsyn	what 50 instances?
@sonney2k	so the site can take quite some load
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I need /new/ {  proxy_pass localhost:8999; }
 lisitsyn	in the nginx config
 lisitsyn	and a user which can run this flask stuff
@sonney2k	shouldn't this be run via some wsgi or sth?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I'll just run at this 8999, should work
@sonney2k	I actually would prefer running it via uwsgi
 lisitsyn	ok then I'd need this setup
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do we have this checked out somewhere already?
 lisitsyn	what does it mean?
 lisitsyn	the website?
@sonney2k	yes
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-web2
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: you could git clone that on the server
 lisitsyn	then run scripts/server
 lisitsyn	and then set up nginx thing to serve that
 lisitsyn	once you're done I can start setting git-based deployment
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, where do I get all the requirements from?!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and where do I get the .env file from?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: pip install -r requirements.txt
 lisitsyn	you don't need .env
 lisitsyn	I guess can be empty
 lisitsyn	that's something by kevin
