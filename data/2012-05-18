 n4nd0	sonney2k, blackburn : I have seen in the logs you have been discussing about the labels hierarchy
 blackburn	yeah
 n4nd0	so what is the conclusion?
 n4nd0	will we use a base class for labels?
 n4nd0	or?
 blackburn	heh no idea lets see what is he will come with
 n4nd0	all right
 n4nd0	I'll keep an eye on github

 n4nd0	hey blackburn
 n4nd0	good morning
 blackburn	hey
 blackburn	morning
 blackburn	how is it going?
 n4nd0	fine, it's starting to be nice weather regularly around here :)
 n4nd0	that makes me happy
 n4nd0	what about you?
 blackburn	did you receive welcome package yet?
 blackburn	heh I have been happy with weather since late april I think
 blackburn	there was virtually no spring at all
 n4nd0	wow, you're luckier in Russia in that sense that in Sweden
 blackburn	just baam and summer
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I didn't receive anything yet
 n4nd0	you?
 blackburn	no, but some guys did already according to gsoc ml
 n4nd0	neither at home nor on the mail, I guess the ACM comes by mail
 n4nd0	yes, it looks like that
 n4nd0	they said we shouldn't worry until May 25th right?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	can you believe that I have not gotten the grades for one of my exams yet?
 n4nd0	I did it on April man, 28th I think
 shogun-buildbot	build #871 of cmdline_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cmdline_static/builds/871  blamelist: fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com
 blackburn	hahh that takes a while to rate your work damn
 n4nd0	haha no way
 blackburn	why do they do it so sloow?
 n4nd0	this teacher is not very good
 n4nd0	she just appeared the 50% of the lectures
 n4nd0	and half an hour late, on average, the times she did it
 n4nd0	anyhow, I think tomorrow it's the last day to publish so they should be ready by then
 blackburn	hah I had had one phd student who 'teached' us calculus
 blackburn	just like your teacher - always late
 n4nd0	too bad
 blackburn	we were so angry with him
 n4nd0	anyhow
 blackburn	so we played kind of tennis
 blackburn	right on lesson
 n4nd0	haha, in the class?
 n4nd0	wow
 blackburn	yes with books and paper
 blackburn	:D
 shogun-buildbot	build #850 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_static/builds/850  blamelist: fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com
 blackburn	and only after two minutes of play he told us (me and one other guy) to leave the room :D
 n4nd0	shogun-buildbot: what did I do to you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you where I can find an example of use of libqp in shogun?
 blackburn	n4nd0: it is used in libocas
 blackburn	only I guess
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah, it seems that it's used there, thanks ;)

 aphex	hi all
 blackburn	hi
 aphex	I have a question about string kernel implemented in shogun
 aphex	I would like to use CLocalAlignmentStringKernel on stringfeatures<char> with alphabet RAWBYTE. Is that compatible ,
 aphex	?
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	aphex: ok looks like it is suited for amino-acids so no idea whether it would work for rawbyte
 aphex	That's what I ve seen too.
 aphex	Do you know what string kernel could be used for RAWBYTE alphabet ?
 blackburn	iirc WeightedDegreeStringKernel should work on rawbyte
 aphex	blackburn: tx. Is there an example with this kernel ?
 blackburn	for which interface?
 aphex	c++
 aphex	blackburn: note: I used string features of different sizes
 blackburn	well check libshogun examples
 blackburn	all kernels are pretty similar
 aphex	blackburn: ok thx

 n4nd0	hey pluskid, how is it going?
 pluskid	n4nd0: hi
 pluskid	I was busy preparing docs for a VISA interview the last two days
 pluskid	almost done with ecoclib
 n4nd0	nice
 pluskid	will move to some papers Cheng mentioned to me
 pluskid	how's it going with SO?
 n4nd0	I hope you visa interview goes good
 n4nd0	it's going good, I find it fun
 pluskid	thanks! it will be on May 29
 n4nd0	you are going to US, right?
 pluskid	n4nd0: cool
 pluskid	yes, I'm going to the US
 pluskid	in mid August
 n4nd0	awesome
 n4nd0	I would really love to go there to do my phd
 pluskid	have you decided where to get a PhD yet?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	I expect to finish during June 2013, in about a year
 pluskid	hmm, I see
 n4nd0	when do you think I should start getting in touch with people there and prepare it seriously?
 pluskid	so you will apply schools this Autumn
 pluskid	n4nd0: I suggest you start to collect information about schools/profs. in the summer holiday
 pluskid	that would be a *huge* survey :D
 pluskid	to get to know who and where you would be interested in
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	for the moment I know that I would like to go to a sunny state
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	I think I would really enjoy living in California
 pluskid	Ah, California is awesome, everybody wants to go there :D
 pluskid	and there are many good universities
 pluskid	with strong machine learning groups
 n4nd0	nice
 pluskid	n4nd0: what do you want to do for your PhD?
 pluskid	I mean, what subarea of ml?
 n4nd0	pluskid: I am interested in robotics, in particular in localization, planning, SLAM and the like
 pluskid	hmm, interesting topic
 pluskid	Andrew Ng has a project of a robot dog, which looks pretty cool
 pluskid	very robust on walking in various difficulty conditions
 n4nd0	pluskid: btw, I was going to ask you about the labels hierarchy you suggested in a PR
 n4nd0	did you get some feedback from sonney2k on that?
-!- uricamic [~uricamic@2001:718:2:1634:1dd1:edc6:9e87:3324] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 pluskid	in a PR?
 pluskid	what is PR?
 pluskid	anyway, the CLabels hierarchy I suggested was rejected by sonney2k
 n4nd0	pull request
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	we'll have to wait and see how he wants to have it then :)
 pluskid	currently MC works fine with the current labels
 pluskid	so that hierarchy might makes thing complicated
 pluskid	not necessary
 pluskid	so currently we will not refactor the labels system for MC
 pluskid	but I'm afraid something is needed for SO
 pluskid	I think you know the best what is needed in SO
 pluskid	maybe we might consider refactoring after your SO labels are created
 n4nd0	I have already created them
 pluskid	oh, cool
 pluskid	where are they?
 n4nd0	but they are kind of out of hierarchy
 n4nd0	take a look to my branch so in github
 n4nd0	or in the pull request here, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/529
 pluskid	we might be able to incorporate them into the hierarchy
 n4nd0	for the idea I have in mind what would be best is to have them under CLabels, something like CLabels <--- CSOLabels
 n4nd0	but the current CLabels should change
 n4nd0	since I am not interested to inherit in the SGVector< float64_t > for non-SO labels for example
 pluskid	I didn't find it, what's the filename for your SOLabels?

-!- emrecelikten [~emrecelik@82.222.148.100] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	but there is almost nothing there yet, quite basic so far
 n4nd0	I am waiting for the decision of the hierarchy
 pluskid	yeah, it's difficulty to work with if CStructuredLabels is not inherited from CLabels
 pluskid	because CSOMachine is interited from CMachine, right?
 pluskid	so you are actually accepting CLabels for set_labels() method
 pluskid	but what you are expecting should be CStructuredLabels
 pluskid	the refactoring is non-trivial, since the implementations are different (SGVector vs. CDynamicObjectArray)
 pluskid	I think you'd better discuss with sonney2k first
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	yesterday blackburn and sonney2k were discussing about it
 n4nd0	if it made sense to have a base class CLabels
 pluskid	so do they have any conclusion?
 pluskid	a base CLabels that is very empty?
 n4nd0	that's is what I support
 n4nd0	but there is no conclusion yet
 pluskid	the problem is this will need a lot of work :p
 pluskid	to modify the existing code to perform explicit casting
 n4nd0	yes, labels are used everywhere

 blackburn	hey
 puffin444	Do you know when karlnapf is typically on irc? He wanted to chat with me about the Model Selection framework.
 blackburn	puffin444: he tends to appear rather randomly last days - he has exams - so no idea
 puffin444	Oh okay.
 blackburn	but IIRC I have seen him there late (for me) evenings
 puffin444	He had some ideas about extending the framework to suit hyperparameter learning.
 puffin444	You
 blackburn	me? :D
 puffin444	What timezone are you in?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	utc+4 I guess
 puffin444	sry typo :)
 puffin444	hmm.... so early afternoon for me.
 puffin444	We have another GSoC IRC meeting the 23rd, yes?
 blackburn	let me check in logs
 blackburn	puffin444: 25th
 blackburn	11 UTC
 blackburn	puffin444: did that presentation of you already take place?
 puffin444	Oh not yet. Not until next week. I am still waiting to hear back for more information.
 blackburn	I see
 puffin444	I think I am going to go ahead and start making a presentation anyway because time is running out.

@sonney2k	blackburn, the solution we had yesterday doesn't work
 blackburn	sonney2k: which one?
@sonney2k	blackburn, removal of CMachine apply()
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	and have customized apply() stuff in sub-machines
@sonney2k	blackburn, because multiclass machine wants to call applyu
@sonney2k	from general machines...
 blackburn	sonney2k: we can assume it is a binary machine
@sonney2k	but machine has no apply -> dead
@sonney2k	we don't have 'binary machines'
 blackburn	we should have binary machine
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	we discussed that yesterday kernelmachines
@sonney2k	are binary,regression, ...
@sonney2k	everything
 blackburn	then I see no way
 blackburn	well wait
@sonney2k	I think we should have apply() return RealLabels
@sonney2k	it won't work for SO though
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is a way
 blackburn	pretty easy
 blackburn	sonney2k: for domain adaptation multiclass svm I extracted outputs of sub-machines to separate functions
 blackburn	they are virtual and could be overrided in linear and kernel multiclass machine
 blackburn	with proper casting
 blackburn	general  multiclass is abstract at all so no problem there
 blackburn	it could have no impl at all
 blackburn	sonney2k: is there any other issue?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have no idea what you are saying
 blackburn	cool
 blackburn	sonney2k: from the very beginning?
 blackburn	sonney2k: all casts before apply in multiclass machine
 blackburn	can go to linear and kernel multiclass machine
 blackburn	with casts to linear and kernel machines
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	so if we add apply in both kernel and linear machine
 blackburn	your issue is solved
 blackburn	sonney2k: got?
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	I don't know what you are talking about
@sonney2k	the only solution I see now is:
@sonney2k	- keep apply() in CMachine
 blackburn	sonney2k: again..
@sonney2k	- check the label type of the returned label
 blackburn	can we move apply to
 blackburn	kernel
 blackburn	and linear
 blackburn	machines?
@sonney2k	and cast appropriately
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	what is the issue you want to solve??
@sonney2k	because some machines work with any other machine that have an apply() method
-!- vikram360 [~vikram360@117.192.176.104] has quit [Ping timeout: 246 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: where you want to put apply?
@sonney2k	in CMachine if possible
 blackburn	if not?
@sonney2k	in submachines
 blackburn	which ones?
@sonney2k	linear, kernel, etc
@sonney2k	but it is possible
@sonney2k	only problem is that interfaces that cannot cast just get some Label object
 blackburn	why did you say we can't put apply to linearmachine?
@sonney2k	which sucks...
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have to have it in CMachine
@sonney2k	because e.g. multiclass machine calls apply() on general machines
 blackburn	sonney2k: I said two times we can use apply on linear/kernel machines in multiclass machines
@sonney2k	how?
 blackburn	sonney2k: put apply part to {linear,kernel}multiclassmachine
@sonney2k	not nice either
 blackburn	??
 blackburn	solves your issue
@sonney2k	but you would need to determine the machine type in mc machine
@sonney2k	then cast to linear/kernel machine and call apply there
 blackburn	in linearmulticlassmachine all machines are linearmachines
 blackburn	implemented virtual method of {linear,kernel}multiclassmachine does the job of casting and applying
 blackburn	now we anyway cast it to CMachine
 blackburn	anyway I need to made that apply part virtual
 blackburn	because DA MC SVM needs to combine outputs of target and source domain submachines
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	I will commit da mc svm soon
@sonney2k	but I would try to get apply() to return just the baseclass
 blackburn	base class?
 blackburn	CLabels?
@sonney2k	CLabels
 blackburn	didn't you want to remove base class there?
@sonney2k	well I thought I had no other option
 blackburn	is there a way now?
@sonney2k	but I think we have an option
@sonney2k	yeah we always just return CLabel* on apply()
 blackburn	is there any other issue except that multiclass?
@sonney2k	I mean if we construct a MulticlassLabel or so it will be cast to CLabel and can be cast back
@sonney2k	so no problem
@sonney2k	and it will work with StructuredOutputLabel too
@sonney2k	so CMachine has a nice interface
 blackburn	yes I am ok with it too
@sonney2k	I think for swig one can hack sth up to return the real label type
@sonney2k	by using %ignore and %rename
@sonney2k	and potential helper functions
@sonney2k	that do the casting to CRealLabel etc
