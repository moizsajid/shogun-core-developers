 pickle27	sonney2k, why are you even up? isn't it like 5 AM there?
@sonney2k	pickle27, hey
@sonney2k	pickle27, yes indeed ... for some reason I woke up around 4 AM and am now doing some gsoc related stuff
@sonney2k	like bills and stuff
 pickle27	crazy
@sonney2k	pickle27, I guess somebody turned on the heater or sth that is why...
 pickle27	could be
 pickle27	its almost midnight here
 pickle27	and super cold lol
@sonney2k	pickle27, in any case it feels good to have the bills done finally ;)
 pickle27	yeah I bet
@sonney2k	pickle27, here it is just around 0 C
@sonney2k	well I did them back in Nov
@sonney2k	but sth was wrong - I am still not sure what it was
 pickle27	that sucks
 pickle27	bills :(
@sonney2k	will be even more fun when we are a registered e.V.
@sonney2k	we will have to do tax decl's ...
@sonney2k	pickle27, so website running?
@sonney2k	pickle27, or further pkg's missing?
 pickle27	one sec
 pickle27	yeah its good now, thanks!
@sonney2k	pickle27, btw I realized when running the demos that some ML algorithms get stuck for extreme parameters - do you know how to run python commands with 'timeouts' ?
 pickle27	not of the top of my head
 pickle27	look into context managers, they might help
@sonney2k	pickle27, ok then I will do some workaround type solution
@sonney2k	sth like set a hard ulimit for the processes
@sonney2k	and if things get killed just respawn
 pickle27	I'll think on it
 pickle27	looks like we need python-beautifulsoup aswell
@sonney2k	pickle27, installed
 pickle27	up
* sonney2k tries to reproduce the python3 error on travis
 pickle27	http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org:1234/
 pickle27	thanks!
@sonney2k	pickle27, perfect
@sonney2k	pickle27, now make it look good :D
 pickle27	haha
@sonney2k	pickle27, maybe run this in a screen session so you can show the others
 pickle27	might wait til I've had a chance to do a bit more before showing everyone
 pickle27	IRC announcements are cool but I don't want to put anything on the mail list for a bit
 pickle27	what do you mean by screen session?
@sonney2k	pickle27, well tell the team
@sonney2k	pickle27, I mean run the manage.py inside screen
@sonney2k	so it stays after you've logged out
 pickle27	oohh right yeah it will die when I close that terminal
 pickle27	yeah I'll get that going and then get some discussion at the next monday meeting
@sonney2k	pickle27, with the final design I hope :)
 pickle27	sonney2k, btw how easy/rough is the deploy process for the actual website?
 pickle27	ha I wish
@sonney2k	pickle27, make release and done
@sonney2k	so fully automagic
 pickle27	okay I was wondering what the reason was for have all the content in the db
 pickle27	Im thinking it might be easier to have more of the pages as static html
@sonney2k	yeah might be - bern4rd (n4nd0s friend) did it this way because it works for anyone even w/o ssh access or anything to the server
@sonney2k	pickle27, currently only wiking, fernando and me have 'make release' access to it
 pickle27	is this pre git hub days?
 pickle27	cause now its pretty easy to make a PR and then have one of you guys deploy it
@sonney2k	pickle27, yes but it got rewritten maybe 2-3 years back
@sonney2k	pickle27, before that it was a static page
 pickle27	yeah I don't want to move the whole thing to static just pages we don't expect to change
 pickle27	like contact
 pickle27	I dunno not sure what I'll I'm gonna do yet
@sonney2k	pickle27, well one step at a time
 pickle27	true!
@sonney2k	pickle27, first of all we need to make the site useable and content easy to find
 pickle27	okay I got to head out, I'll set up the screen session sometime this week
@sonney2k	and you are half way trough imho
 pickle27	and keep working on it
 pickle27	thanks!
@sonney2k	pickle27, cu!

 sonne|work	wiking: so eigen doesn't have this just yet?
 lisitsyn	wiking: some eigen guy is working on it or so
 lisitsyn	iirc
@wiking	sonne|work: noup and accurding to mailing list info
 lisitsyn	ah yeah you found it in the mailing list
@wiking	it'll take a while
@wiking	as they have to redesign quite some within the library
 sonne|work	wiking: but that mail was already from march 2013 right?
@wiking	sonne|work: i've read a more recent mail
 sonne|work	ok so there is hope :)
@wiking	moreover eigen's bugzilla doesn't even have a bug about
@wiking	it
@wiking	http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=70
@wiking	so basically not even sse4.1 dot product is not being used either
 sonne|work	oops...
@wiking	but anyhow
@wiking	we dont use eigen's vector within SGVector
@wiking	so this actually does not concern us
@wiking	:)
@wiking	which means
@wiking	a) should we directly interface SGVector to Eigen's vector if possible/available and then rely on eigen people to write all the support for SSE4.1 AVX etc
@wiking	b) start writing sse4.1 + avx code for SGVector
@wiking	i mean this is actually an issue
@wiking	because -march=native will not do any good
@wiking	in case of vectors atm
@wiking	and although i have never ever checked the coverage of SGVector instructions within shogun
@wiking	but from the code i've been touching we tend to use it (obviously) quite some
@wiking	so these sorts of optimizations would be good to have in the long run
@wiking	heheh
@wiking	here are some stats from the past
@wiking	https://coveralls.io/files/49742735
@wiking	sgvector::dot(float64, float64) called 9,350,216 times ;)
@wiking	maybe i should put back coveralls support for shogun
@wiking	;P
@wiking	sonne|work: u haven't merged 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 into master?
@wiking	oh u did
@wiking	haven't upgraded...
@wiking	sorry
 sonne|work	wiking: :P
 sonne|work	I thought you never managed to get coveralls integrated?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Reenable coveralls reporting
@wiking	sonne|work: something was not working right...
 sonne|work	wiking: or am I mixing everything up now?!?!
@wiking	nono
@wiking	it had problems
@wiking	but maybe cpp-coveralls has been fixed since then
@wiking	as it has quite some commits since last september
@wiking	well we'll see now

@wiking	mmmm what now? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: or is this just for compiling libshogun?
 sonne|work	then I wouldn't expect this
@wiking	compiling shogun with --gcov
@wiking	ah ok i think this can be fixed
@wiking	changing from make -j4 to j2
 sonne|work	wiking: how?
 sonne|work	wiking: ahh or -j1 even
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	anyhow i this is a new branch in the travis config
@wiking	if coveralls build -> j@
@wiking	luckily it still continues
@wiking	because a make install triggers a make ;P{

 sonne|work	Hey lambday!
 sonne|work	wiking: *lol*
@wiking	sonne|work: what? :)
 sonne|work	(10:29:29 AM) wiking: luckily it still continues
 sonne|work	(10:29:37 AM) wiking: because a make install triggers a make ;P{
 sonne|work	wiking: kind of ROTFLBTC here
@wiking	but it stopped :<
@wiking	because the coveralls only triggers after_succcess
@wiking	:(
 sonne|work	meh
@wiking	$ if [ -z $CMAKE_OPTIONS ] ; then make -j 2 ; else make -j 4 ; fi
@wiking	/home/travis/build.sh: line 223: [: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug: binary operator expected
@wiking	okeey so what would be the good if?
 sonne|work	wiking: use /bin/bash in that script
 sonne|work	ubuntu uses dash by default so you have issues like this
 sonne|work	ohh and "" around the $CMAKE_OPTIONS
@wiking	[[
@wiking	The [[ builtin is a bashism, and has somewhat better-defined semantics than [ (a.k.a. test). However, it is still quite reasonable to use [ instead, and portable scripts must do so. Note that argument handling is not quite the same; as above, use = rather than ==.
@wiking	Do not be confused by use of [[ in Autoconf macros, used to double-quote literal strings. This is for a different purpose and is not the same as bash's [[ builtin. (The convention in Autoconf macros is to spell [ as test to avoid confusion.)
@wiking	so if i do
@wiking	if [[ -z $CMAKE_OPTIONS ]]
 sonne|work	wiking: it is the missing "
@wiking	that should be the same
 sonne|work	"$CMAKE_OPTIONS"
 sonne|work	will fix it
@wiking	  - if [ -z "$CMAKE_OPTIONS" ] ; then make -j 2 ; else make -j 4 ; fi
@wiking	or if [[ -z "$CMAKE_OPTIONS" ]]
 sonne|work	wiking: just use test -z "$CMAK..."
 sonne|work	if test -z "$CMA..."; then foo ; fi
@wiking	- if test -z "$CMAKE_OPTIONS" ; then make -j 2 ; else make -j 4 ; fi
@wiking	?

 lambday	sonne|work: hi :)
 lambday	sorry got dc
@wiking	or i have no idea actually
@wiking	why i have that if there
@wiking	a) to cirmumvent problems with UNIT compilation
@wiking	b) modular ?
@wiking	i reckon it's a)
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	Travis: speed up compilation time in modular jobs
@wiking	so yeah make -j4 should kick in for modular
@wiking	only problem is that coveralls target needs CMAKE_OPTIONS as well
 sonne|work	wiking: can't you have an extra config for coveralls then?
 sonne|work	lambday: hey - how is it going :)
 lambday	wiking: I was just checking RationalApproximation -
 lambday	sonne|work: going good.. was giving the clone bug a shot
 lambday	that roman reported
 sonne|work	lambday: do you know this error: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20140205-0744.html
 sonne|work	in Malsar* I mean (hope that is your code ...)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: its mine
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: ahh ha!
 lambday	sonne|work: its
 lisitsyn	malsar is mine :D
 lambday	hehe :D
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well wouln't it be nice to see the actual error in the log now?!

 lambday	HeikoS1: hi
 lambday	HeikoS1: was checking the clone bug... haven't found the exact problem yet but found something - even when in kernel rhs equals lhs, clone goes ahead and creates two copies of those two
 lambday	HeikoS1: although that shouldn't be a problem  - but I am not sure if clone is doing it the right way - we get few illegal writes while cloning the SGMatrix which is possible causing memory corruption

@wiking	??
@wiking	what's that?
@wiking	ah sure who has 361 eur/month to burn? :D
@wiking	lol that's like 4332 eur/year
@wiking	well if we could have each yearh 9 gsoc projects
@wiking	then it'd be doable :D

 sonne|work	bigger than my macbooks harddrive :D

@wiking	well
@wiking	he has better founding than us i guess :)
 sonne|work	max planck -> research heaven
@wiking	hehehe well there we go :)
@wiking	let's get some VPS at max planck :)))
 sonne|work	I mean it is 10 years ago now that I trained stuff there
 sonne|work	and I had 32G at that time
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	see better founding :)
 sonne|work	and 4-8 cores
@wiking	sonne|work: state founded or privately?
@wiking	or both?
 sonne|work	state
 sonne|work	so no obligations
@wiking	well it's easy to burn .de govermental money :)))
@wiking	*state money
@wiking	:>
 sonne|work	you can really focus on doing research there
@wiking	public money for the waste :)
 sonne|work	so it is money well spent
@wiking	'waste'
 sonne|work	well they have sufficiently many nobel price winners so not really a wast
* sonne|work food
@wiking	yeah i was just saying
@wiking	sonne|work: although that'd be interested to see how many of them they did their work at the institute and got for that the prize
@wiking	as usually the nobel laureates get the prize and they get picked up by a big research instituate
@wiking	*inititut
@wiking	whatever :D
@wiking	cannot spall today
@wiking	ahahahaha damn it :D
@wiking	S P E L L :D
@wiking	ok so it's done Done. Your build exited with 0.
@wiking	but no result on https://coveralls.io/r/shogun-toolbox/shogun

@wiking	great
 lambday	HeikoS1: found the error... compiling..

 lambday	:)
 lambday	while I am at it, I will also make sure sparse clone works too
 lambday	for asymmetric dimension
 HeikoS1	lambday: good point

@sonney2k	wiking, I somehow need to learn how to read this
@sonney2k	wiking, so this lists test coverage or what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: okay now I can get to
 lisitsyn	that xslt
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
@sonney2k	wiking, I like these https://coveralls.io/files/130873316 a lot
@sonney2k	wiking, could you add another entrance task? Increase test coverage - with a link to coveralls.io?
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean that is really easy to write some test for some of the 0% tested classes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, excellent!
@wiking	sonney2k: yep.... will remove some other files (tests+examples)
@sonney2k	wiking, but these are inside src/shogun so I think we should remove them completely
@sonney2k	wiking, *really* useful!
* sonney2k is excited
 lisitsyn	where is the xslt?
@sonney2k	wiking, btw do we have an automated test for our deep and shallow copy constructor?
@wiking	sonney2k: what do u mean by 'inside src/shogun'
@wiking	sonney2k: honestly no idea
@wiking	sonney2k: if u check the covaralls there's going to be covarage info on examples/undocumented.... and tests/unit and benchmarks....
@wiking	so those should be removed imo
@wiking	that's just some extra exclusion flag nothing fancy
@sonney2k	wiking, yes true
