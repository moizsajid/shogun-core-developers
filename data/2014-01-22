 shogun-buildbot	Hey! build debian wheezy - memcheck #165 is complete: Success [build successful]
 shogun-buildbot	Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/165
@wiking	sonney2k: couldn't get memcheck buildbot to return -1 in case of failure ... that's why it's green

 sonne|work	wiking: but we could just grep the result file (no idea where it is) but then we would have it red
 sonne|work	wiking: I mean these are really critical and no one noticed due to it being green
 sonne|work	wiking: the other static anlysis things are just hints - not really that helpful
@wiking	sonne|work: mmm yeah and a nice xslt would be good as well to be human parsable :P
