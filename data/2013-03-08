 blackburn	sonney2k: okay nice I'll take a look
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice naming, I'd like to put BMRM here to
 blackburn	BMRMCCCSOSVM
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am not 100% sure what CCCSOSVM means / does and wiking didn't document a bit
 blackburn	ha! google now has street view in my town
@sonney2k	blackburn, only in mine it will never have studpid germans...
 blackburn	let me show you the house I live :)

 blackburn	that one far away just near the trees
@sonney2k	blackburn, I've fixed (hopefully) the remaining warnings. now you need to 'only' get tapkee not to crash and we can release
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay sure I want it not to crash too :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, the white one?
@sonney2k	straight or left?
 blackburn	sonney2k: straight, covered by trees
 blackburn	sonney2k: below the cloud
 blackburn	sonney2k: all the city is made of blocks - they didn't enter these blocks though
 blackburn	sonney2k: we also have factory haha https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.556397,49.253522&spn=0.001683,0.009999&t=h&z=17&layer=c&cbll=53.556397,49.253517&panoid=EBsYw10RYol_l7WV_2C78Q&cbp=11,357.51,,0,-2.8
 blackburn	look - people are making cars and use them to get to the factory
 blackburn	where they are making more cars
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha
@sonney2k	blackburn, this is where I grew up - you have to look up to see the actual building

@sonney2k	or look behind you to get an impression how these buildings look like :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: pretty tall yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: 22 floors?
 blackburn	sonney2k: you won't impress me that much as I work in these building: https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.203237,50.155871&spn=0.001697,0.009999&t=h&z=17&layer=c&cbll=53.203508,50.15489&panoid=neRCH6sWeTFSJOLcJBCe2Q&cbp=11,146.75,,0,-34.67

 blackburn	sonney2k: http://cs7009.vk.me/c407119/v407119002/612d/ia9K30M0pa4.jpg angela is happy with her new phone
 blackburn	sonney2k: I should tell you a funny story about openmp
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was using clock() to measure time
 blackburn	sonney2k: and I tried so hard to make openmp implementation fast
 blackburn	but what I was getting is nearly the same time
 blackburn	and just accidentally I realized what I was measuring

 blackburn	heiko: sonney2k: could you please run converter_laplacianeigenmaps_modular.py ?
 heiko	blackburn: with the latest version or is the one from a few days ago fine?
 blackburn	heiko: hmm if it'd take time just run the one you have now
 blackburn	heiko: I just can't reproduce the error
 heiko	already updated :) compiling ... will let you know
 blackburn	thanks
 blackburn	heiko: btw about openmp story I told to soeren
 blackburn	heiko: I easily got 2-3x speedup here
 heiko	what compared to what?
 blackburn	heiko: so you may try that too
 blackburn	heiko: compared to serial
 heiko	I see
 heiko	mmh
 blackburn	heiko: with one line
 blackburn	well two
 heiko	oh
 heiko	that sounds good
 heiko	however, 2-3x doesnt really matter for me
 heiko	I need 2-3k :)
 blackburn	heiko: do you have 2-3k cores?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	(not on my laptop though)
 blackburn	heiko: ehm well it should scale
 heiko	the cores are on different machines
 heiko	largest machine has 48 or something
 blackburn	heiko: 2-3x is because I have intel core 2 with hyperthreading
 blackburn	heiko: then you could get 48
 heiko	no, then I dont move in the cluster queue
 heiko	it is better to ask for 48 cores which can be located on any machine
 blackburn	heiko: anyway I can teach you some openmp if you want
 heiko	you get this very fast, while asking for one complete machine takes ages
 blackburn	heiko: the only problem is that Soeren didn't want to have both pthreads and openmp at the same time
 heiko	blackburn, yes please
 heiko	I see
 heiko	blackburn: but openmp should be easier right?
 heiko	pthreads is a pain
 blackburn	heiko: yes adding one pragma
 blackburn	heiko: clang doesn't support openmp properly though
 heiko	blackburn: cool lets talk about that, but lets do it later, I have do do other things now :)
 blackburn	but pragmas are effectively ignored
 blackburn	heiko: if you want an example
 heiko	blackburn: mmmh would that hurt us? with clang?
 blackburn	let me show and then lets get back to that later
 blackburn	heiko: no, pragmas are ignored if they are not supported
 blackburn	https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/tapkee/routines/isomap.hpp
 blackburn	heiko: all I had to add is line 44  and line 51
 blackburn	heiko: and it became parallel
 heiko	blacburn, thats cool!
 heiko	so that is like parfor in matlab
 blackburn	no idea about parfor
 blackburn	parallel for?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	of independent things
 blackburn	heiko: I'd say much more powerful
 blackburn	heiko: openmp supports not only independent things
 blackburn	heiko: a variety of locks is supported too
 heiko	blackburn: cool
 blackburn	heiko: https://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee/blob/master/tapkee/routines/locally_linear.hpp#L138
 heiko	I will get back to you on this tonight
 heiko	to speedup some MMD things :)
 blackburn	heiko: that's how you make only one thread doing something
 blackburn	#pragma omp critical
 blackburn	{ ... }
 heiko	gotta go now, sorry
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am having the same difficulties with io that heiko had
 blackburn	I see no messages

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: a few more doxygen fixes
 blackburn	sonney2k: level_above is incorrect
@sonney2k	blackburn, -v please?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I replaced its impl with return true and it worked

 blackburn	sonney2k: I tried to output more information when debugging my stuff and got no output
@sonney2k	ohh loglevel >= type!

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix logging of functions
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be we should add explicit values to enum
@sonney2k	heiko, blackburn, we should be down to 1 warning on python_modular again
@sonney2k	that's as good as it gets
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes sure, I'll take care of it once I get some tapkee things fixed
@sonney2k	blackburn, no we are already I meant
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	okay that's even better
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, for logging enum yes sure just do it
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will check if it works now
@sonney2k	heiko, blackburn - I would like to run generator.py again - all the old tests won't work any longer due to our CLabels -> CBinaryLabels etc changes
@sonney2k	so serialization is b0rken anyways
@sonney2k	blackburn, for that to work I need you example to not crash though...
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is *exactly* what I am trying to fix
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please run it too?
 blackburn	converter_laplacian
@sonney2k	blackburn, compiling again...
 blackburn	sonney2k: it now output *only* SG_INFO
 blackburn	if SG_INFO is set
@sonney2k	MSG_INFO you mean?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: still doesn't work
 blackburn	sonney2k: I set it to MSG_INFO and what I get is *only* info
 blackburn	I set it to debug and get only debug..
@sonney2k	weird
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw our CTime is incorrect for openmp too
 blackburn	as clock() will measure everything that was ticked by say 4 CPUs
 blackburn	multiplying the time by 4
@sonney2k	blackburn, no ctime is not incorrect
@sonney2k	CTime can measure both wall clock and cpu time
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah okay there is a method using gettimeofday

 n4nd0	so the values in the function definition are default values I believe
 n4nd0	and about the parameter list
 heiko	I meant the parameter list
 n4nd0	normally the method is called something like this

 heiko	if __name__=='__main__':
 heiko	print('MMDKernelSelection')
 heiko	kernel_choice_linear_time_mmd_single(*parameter_list[0])
 heiko	kernel_choice_linear_time_mmd_comb()
 heiko	#show()
 heiko	like this?
@sonney2k	heiko, no
@sonney2k	then make 2 examples out of this
 heiko	sonney2k: thx
 heiko	sonney2k: so if I return an instance of CGaussianKernel
 heiko	is this serialised and the width is asserted to be correct?
@sonney2k	heiko, not just the width
 heiko	and other things
@sonney2k	everything that belongs to the gaussian kernel
 heiko	cool
@sonney2k	same features, subsets everything
 heiko	sonney2k: that is really awesome!
 blackburn	I am surprised heiko is being surprised by shogun :)
 heiko	blackburn: I tend to not look at things sometimes :)
 heiko	I knew this existed
 heiko	but I did not know how it worked and how simple it is
 blackburn	sonney2k: filling news
 heiko	sonney2k:  is polymorphism correlty handled in python
 heiko	so if I have classes A->B
 heiko	and in python, I have an instance of B under the interface of A
 heiko	and then return this in the example
 heiko	is B serialised or only the A part of it?

@sonney2k	heiko, it should work since the serialization underneath is done by the c++ classes
 blackburn	sonney2k: we should mention perl, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes as alpha

 blackburn	sonney2k: writing an announcement but not sure about our status
@sonney2k	blackburn, still debugging...
@sonney2k	blackburn, whats up with ./classifier_multiclasslogisticregression_modular.py:25: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] multiclass/MulticlassLogisticRegression.cpp:MulticlassLogisticRegression: Unstable method!  Please report if it seems to work or not to the Shogun mailing list.  Thanking you in anticipation.
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't have time to debug it probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: not that I mean it doesn't work
 blackburn	sonney2k: but I was suspicious iirc, no idea what to do with it
@sonney2k	blackburn, does features_dense_protocols_modular.py work for you?
 blackburn	sonney2k: TypeError: cannot make memory view because object does not have the buffer interface
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah here too :-( Could you ask gsomix what's wrong?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not crazy close to him as usually but asked via IM :)

 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn how is it going?
 blackburn	heiko: bugzz
@sonney2k	heiko, I've fixed bugs/warnings and quietened your examples
 heiko	sonney2k: I see, what else is missing?
@sonney2k	and ran the generator.py
@sonney2k	most of the stuff seems to work
@sonney2k	what does not still is the vw stuff
@sonney2k	(I disabled that for now)
 heiko	sonney2k: yeah, we kind of waited too long to fix that....
 heiko	sonney2k:  any ideas how to proceed with that?
@sonney2k	heiko, argh clash
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/891/steps/compile%20r_modular/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	could you please rename the variable result to sth else
 heiko	sure
@sonney2k	(swig-R uses that already when returning stuff)
@sonney2k	heiko, I am tempted to release nevertheless
 heiko	without the vw stuff?
@sonney2k	but we have other issues (potentially)
@sonney2k	json (de)serialization
 heiko	I dont know, maybe we should invest some time into the streaming stuff since it becomes harder and harder to fix
 heiko	but not sure
@sonney2k	then blackburn 'unstable' marked method
 blackburn	sonney2k: what?
@sonney2k	and some examples fail when running tester.py
@sonney2k	and then the buffer protocol issue
@sonney2k	no idea if this is important enough for a blocker
 heiko	sonney2k: well are we in a hurry with the release?
 blackburn	yes
 heiko	because?
 blackburn	gsoc
@sonney2k	in any case if we don't work on this / fix this stuff in the next few days then  I don't think these would be an excuse to not rlease
@sonney2k	heiko, well no feature commits allowed until we release
 heiko	what about taking one week to fix things?
 heiko	sonney2k: yes, agreed, only bugfixed
 blackburn	I don't mind
@sonney2k	I don't have time to fix things though
 heiko	sonney2k: blackburn and documentation maybe
@sonney2k	if you both can do it?
 blackburn	I probably can
 heiko	sonney2k: I usually have a few hours per day for shogun, so we could try
 heiko	fixed a couple of non-trivial bugs last week
 heiko	so what about next sunday then?
 heiko	we definitely release then and postpone all new features to then
@sonney2k	blackburn, when is gsoc application deadline?
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you write anything yet?
 blackburn	sonney2k: 29, no
 blackburn	yes I know
 blackburn	:)
@sonney2k	I am just saying.... I won't be of much help this year
@sonney2k	and it will take much more time than fixing these last bugs
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I will start veryson
 blackburn	soon
 n4nd0	blackburn: I can help with gsoc application
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'll share google doc around later
 n4nd0	ok

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Merge pull request #912 from karlnapf/master
 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix swig-R clash
 heiko	blackburn: let me know if I should write things apart from my project idea
@sonney2k	n4nd0, we also need the cool new website...
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we have to have all ideas properly described before deadline?
 heiko	we are getting closer to pull request #1000 :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, of course
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I will have time for that probably during the next weekend
 blackburn	sonney2k: we should ask possible mentors to describe ideas more then
@sonney2k	blackburn, we should have same quality like we had last year
 blackburn	sonney2k: we will
 n4nd0	sonney2k: but it is lot of CSS in there.. not sure how long will it take
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I spend all my free time on release preparations and won't have any/much time next week
@sonney2k	heiko, blackburn - let us please release next thurday
 n4nd0	sonney2k: IMHO the webpage is fine as it is, the dropdown menu would be nicer yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok!
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you be still an admin or backup admin?
 heiko	thursday then, ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, if our chances are better if I am still an admin then I am admin otherwise backup
@sonney2k	heiko, and no feature commits!
@sonney2k	just bugfixes
@sonney2k	heiko, please run
@sonney2k	git pull
 heiko	sonney2k: sure
@sonney2k	git submodule update
 blackburn	sonney2k: well there are pros and cons - pro is that I am former gsocer 'leaded' the project
@sonney2k	and then go to
@sonney2k	tests/integration/python_modular
@sonney2k	and run
@sonney2k	python tester.py
 blackburn	cons is that I am not known as you
 heiko	sonney2k: I will work on those this week
@sonney2k	heiko, it would be a dream if we got all those to working
@sonney2k	then we could integrate that in our tests on the buildbot!
 heiko	sonney2k: that might be a bit of a dream :) but I see what I can do
 heiko	sonney2k: that would be a great idea
@sonney2k	heiko, well I wrote that stuff 2 or 3 years back
@sonney2k	and wanted them to be all stable :)
 heiko	sonney2k: I am always concerned about making things automatically check themselves
 heiko	so it is not allowed to change the files I guess :)
@sonney2k	exactly
 heiko	Things might change internally without the result being changed
 heiko	imagine you are sampling something random (with fixed seed)
 heiko	and then change the order in the algorithm
 heiko	same result, fails test
@sonney2k	heiko, sure
-!- n4nd0 [~fjig@orange-03.csc.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
@sonney2k	then just run generator.py with the example as filename
@sonney2k	and commit
 heiko	sonney2k:  most tests probably fail due to crashes or other things
@sonney2k	it is just important that this is a conscious decision
 heiko	sonney2k: indeed
@sonney2k	the easy bugs fail like this yes
 heiko	is there any way of checking how the file was created? what if the example changed or something?
@sonney2k	heiko, well contract is that you update the file when you change the example
@sonney2k	(to return e.g. more stuff)
 heiko	yes
 heiko	sonney2k:  I feel like we should have a "hacking shogun" readme which explains those things
@sonney2k	look at this: zero warnings in octave_modular, ruby_modular,python_modular :)
 heiko	anyway, I know it now
 heiko	sonney2k:  nice :)
@sonney2k	heiko, well if it is on the buildslave then one would immediately know
 heiko	sonney2k: yes, thats a good goal, would be very good before gsoc
 heiko	sonney2k btw I always forget the link to the live tutorial pdf
 blackburn	sonney2k: which email of you I should use to share the doc?

@sonney2k	heiko, isn't that on the shogun website?

 blackburn	sonney2k: please ask quoc le and olivier chapelle to provide descriptions of projects
 heiko	sonney2k: cannot find
 heiko	blackburn: thanks!
 heiko	blackburn: you should consider a doctor with your killing fantasies :)
 blackburn	heiko: that's ok!
 heiko	blackburn: sonney2k, could we have access to last's year application?
@sonney2k	heiko, no idea then either
 blackburn	heiko: I'll send it to you
 blackburn	and n4nd0
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn I have to go now, have a good evening!
 blackburn	heiko: night :D
