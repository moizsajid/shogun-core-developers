 sonne|work	wiking,  it was a nightmare with boost and the reason we did create our own. To me it looks like the same bloat comes with this serialiaztion lib
 sonne|work	and yes template only is what scares me here

@wiking	sonne|work: really?
@wiking	HeikoS: ping
@HeikoS	wiking: pong
@HeikoS	wiking: how are thing?
@wiking	sonne|work: for me that's the only appealing thing in it... that we dont need to depend on a built lib, only some headers
@wiking	sonne|work: i mean according to that benchmark the other good option would be supporting msgpack
@wiking	HeikoS: what do u think about this: http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/
@HeikoS	wiking: never used this, but looks very clean
@wiking	HeikoS: yesterday somebody came in and started to complain about the serialization fw :P
@wiking	that a simple linearkernel (200*3000 train features) multiclass svm serialization took longer time than actual training
@wiking	and that the serialized file was 250 megs :P

-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah we should do this properly i agree
@HeikoS	wiking: after gsoc
 lambday	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	wiking: this will remove many bits of parameter framework and make shogun classes a lot slimmer
@HeikoS	wiking: also compile time will get much better
@HeikoS	lambday: so i wanted to ask
@HeikoS	lambday: whats the state of the feature/mmd and feature/btest branch
@HeikoS	lambday: can we merge them at least into one feature branch?
 lambday	HeikoS: its ready to be merged already
@HeikoS	which is in shogun github?
 lambday	HeikoS: oh.. actualy feature/btest is my local branch but I sent the PR against feature/mmd in shogun core
 lambday	wait just a sec I am double checking

-!- shogun-buildbot [~shogun-bu@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: would be great if i could send patches against the latest mmd state
@HeikoS	lambday: so we should merge this i guess?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes... in shogun its feature/mmd only
@HeikoS	lambday: exactly
 lambday	I sent my last patch against that and its ready to be merged
@HeikoS	lambday: i see
 lambday	except only one thing... I need to generate data
@HeikoS	lambday: there were problems with unit tests
@HeikoS	let me chekc
 lambday	HeikoS: yes big unit-tests are disabled due to time limitation on travis
 lambday	http://housing.com/in/bangalore/pg/3407/
 lambday	oops sorry
 lambday	wrong link
 lambday	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2349
@HeikoS	lambday: there is also the deprecated pr
 lambday	HeikoS: yes that one only
@HeikoS	lambday: can we merge this?
@HeikoS	lambday: then i can build on it
@HeikoS	lambday: and maybe fix the problems soon?
 lambday	HeikoS: I think yes... let me check once
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, then just merge when ready
@HeikoS	lambday: i understand this can be merged into main once the linalg stuff is done?
 lambday	HeikoS: I am restarting the travis build as it was a dark age when this PR happened (travis-wise)
 lambday	HeikoS: no this is independent of linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: so can we merge this into develop?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes... but that will break the integration tests temporarily... I'll have to generate data for that with this new implementation
@HeikoS	lambday: ok then no
 lambday	HeikoS: restarted the travis build
@HeikoS	lambday: i suggest you merge into the feature branch
@HeikoS	lambday: now actually
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
@HeikoS	lambday: then i can read things, and you can sort out the problems during the next days?
@HeikoS	lambday: and once this is done we merge into develop
 lambday	HeikoS: regarding sorting out things - the only thing left was to disable some tests (which I already did) and generate data
 lambday	HeikoS: should I send the data PR before we merge it into develop??
@HeikoS	lambday: yes, we dont want to break develop ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: great then
@HeikoS	lambday: so go for it, merge the feature
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... maybe wait for travis? I'll merge it by today only
