 CIA-1	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4688b54 / examples/undocumented/java_modular/check.sh : require 1GB java heap space - http://git.io/Xo9XAA
 blackburn	heh you online
 blackburn	sonney2k: hello!:)
 CIA-1	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rfd27f86 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/serialization_matrix_modular.py : add missing import os - http://git.io/unSFKg
 shogun-buildbot	build #256 of java_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/java_modular/builds/256
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: u there?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: yes
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: Have you checked the results of the file I sent you ?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: sry not very carefully
 blackburn	how to use it properly?
 blackburn	I'll check it now
 puneetgoyal	ok, I will mail you some details
 blackburn	you probably should not use absolute paths..
 blackburn	like indir='/home/puneet/shogun/test'
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: what is stopwords?
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: stopwords are those which we dont need to take in into account while categorizing them
 blackburn	hmm
 puneetgoyal	as spam or ham
 blackburn	you probably better to use TF-IDF for this..
 puneetgoyal	ok
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: but anyways, what exactly I'm supposed to check?
 puneetgoyal	I just need to know..if I am going on the right path....and what to do next
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: hmm okay it is useful experience anyway
 blackburn	I would suggest you to write simple TF-IDF
 blackburn	and use it as features
 blackburn	for classify
 blackburn	do you know what TF-IDF is?
 puneetgoyal	I havent read much about it
 blackburn	it is pretty easy
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: thresholding tf-idf can be used just like 'stopwords' concept
 blackburn	i.e. common words will have ~0 tf-idf
 puneetgoyal	0 means it has no contribution in calculating the probability of the mail being a spam or a ham?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: yes
 puneetgoyal	ok...and more the no. that word occurred...more will be its value of tf-idf
 puneetgoyal	if it is not a stop word
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: idf(term) = log of (total word counts) / (number of documents having term)
 blackburn	yes, then thresholding it say 0.1 or so
 blackburn	you will get most valuable words
 blackburn	and then you can just form feature vectors
 puneetgoyal	I was stucked here
 blackburn	why?
 puneetgoyal	Actually what method I was using..I found the words which were valuable....but was not able to find out where should procede further
 puneetgoyal	feature vector of what I should make?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: okay if you have computed tf-idfs
 blackburn	you will get some 'rates'
 blackburn	for words X,Y,Z,...
 puneetgoyal	yup
 blackburn	then for document 1 you will get (X rate for doc 1, Y rate for doc 1, Z rate for doc 1, ...)
 blackburn	same way for other docs
 blackburn	then you can use really any classifier
 blackburn	cause you will get euclidean representation for your texts
 puneetgoyal	hmm..ok
 blackburn	isn't it clear for you yet? we've got to make it really clear :)
 puneetgoyal	actually I am not much clear with the concept of classification...
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: hmm ok
 puneetgoyal	Even after running some examples...I got the training data...I got all the results which you were asking us to get...but didnt get to know how it was being classified
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: you could check some lectures probably..
 blackburn	what exactly don't you understand?
 puneetgoyal	hmm...I guess I will need to look for more examples..
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: we have really bad examples
 blackburn	that's the thing you can help us with
 blackburn	in fact our examples is just tests :)
 puneetgoyal	hmmm
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: okay I'll write you a snippet
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: oh...no need to do that if you re busy...I will just get back to you with some solid example..where I could tell you what my real problem is
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: not busy now :)
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: gr8!....I got an example though...
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: I sent a little example
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: there are two figures: one for train data - two gaussian blobs
 blackburn	then we add new points and predict it
 puneetgoyal	ok
 blackburn	you will see how it work a little
 blackburn	ok sleep time now :)
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: see you
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: ok..thanks a lot.good nite :)
