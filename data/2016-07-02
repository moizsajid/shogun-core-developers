 sanuj	bzdmgz, yo
 bzdmgz	sanuj: hey
 sanuj	bzdmgz, how to get started with plugins and bring them in shogun
 bzdmgz	uhmm you need some prototype first
 bzdmgz	sanuj: have you seen in this aer thing we had dlopen
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@host-92-0-162-192.as43234.net] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 sanuj	yeah i saw that
 sanuj	bzdmgz, but that's only for linux
 bzdmgz	no that's posix
 bzdmgz	macos and any unix and any linux
 bzdmgz	good enough
 bzdmgz	sanuj: so the idea is
 sanuj	ohkay
 bzdmgz	any plugin is a dynamic library that exposes just one function
 bzdmgz	in aer it was called manifest IIRC
 sanuj	yes
 sanuj	it is manifest
 bzdmgz	so this exposed function returns you a pointer to manifest
 bzdmgz	and manifest can create some objects for you
 sanuj	bzdmgz, so i first build a separate prototype repo using aer code?
 bzdmgz	well mostly up to you
 bzdmgz	just be sure to understand what's going on
 bzdmgz	before we get into this mess :D
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	bzdmgz, you are here for 2 weeks right?
 bzdmgz	sanuj: yeap 2 weeks more then one week out then back
 sanuj	okay, i would like to do the plugin foundation stuff in these 2 weeks so i can work autonomously while you are away
 bzdmgz	ok sure lets try to do that
 sanuj	bzdmgz, it seems this is not the correct method to check if a symbol with "name" exists
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer/blob/master/src/aer/dynamic/library.cpp#L33
 sanuj	we should use dlerror()
 sanuj	http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen
 bzdmgz	ok feel free %)
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	bzdmgz, is this a working prototype?
 sanuj	how to test
 bzdmgz	well there was an example
 bzdmgz	it worked
 bzdmgz	back then
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	bzdmgz, what does this do => T (*fm)();
 bzdmgz	pointer to function that returns T
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	bzdmgz, *(void**)(&fm) = dlsym(handle, name.c_str());
 sanuj	can't we do => (void*)fm = dlsym(..)
 bzdmgz	no idea, you can try
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	kernel is an overexploited term in computer science
 sanuj	random thought ^

 sanuj	bzdmgz, std::function<int(int)> fn1 = half;
 sanuj	what is int(int) here?
 bzdmgz	man
 bzdmgz	:D
 bzdmgz	int argument int return value
 sanuj	yeah but you need to pass a type to <>
 bzdmgz	what type?
 sanuj	std::function<int>
 sanuj	i'm seeing the int(int) thing for the first time in <> :P
 bzdmgz	what does that even mean
 bzdmgz	std::function is not just a no-parameter function
 bzdmgz	it can haz parameterz
 sanuj	bzdmgz, i meant i hadn't seen functions passed as template arguments before
 sanuj	only data types and objects
 bzdmgz	yeah C++ is big
 sanuj	it's huuuuuuuggeee
 sanuj	bzdmgz, std::function<As<T>()>, this means a function returning As<T> with no arguments?
 bzdmgz	yes
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	bzdmgz, what is this line doing
 sanuj	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer/blob/master/src/aer/dynamic/manifest.hpp#L70
 bzdmgz	lambda
 sanuj	ohkay
 bzdmgz	"->" to specify the output type
 sanuj	oh so you need to do this to get object from manifest
 sanuj	auto metaclass = manifest.classByName<MyBaseClass>("basic");
 sanuj	auto object = metaclass.instance();
 sanuj	bzdmgz, we will have to do this everytime when we want a new object from a plugin?
 sanuj	metaclass.instance();
 bzdmgz	kind of yeah
 sanuj	bzdmgz, in python also
 sanuj	or will this be hidden?
 bzdmgz	no this should be hidden
 sanuj	how will it be hidden?
 bzdmgz	mmm
 bzdmgz	create<T>(name)
 bzdmgz	whatever
 sanuj	ohkay
 bzdmgz	if you want T called "svm-super-classifier"
 bzdmgz	I guess you iterate over plugins
 bzdmgz	or so
 sanuj	this function loads the plugin and returns an object and then closes the plugin?
 bzdmgz	I don't think we should unload the plugin immediately
 bzdmgz	but the idea is quite like that
 sanuj	ohkay
 sanuj	bzdmgz, i understand your plugin prototype
 bzdmgz	good
 sanuj	i ran on local
 sanuj	it works
 bzdmgz	sanuj: I think we need to get back to class_list thing
 bzdmgz	remember this one?
 sanuj	yeah
 bzdmgz	ok sry have to go now
 sanuj	bzdmgz, but what about windows support
 sanuj	ohkay
 bzdmgz	ah nevermind
 bzdmgz	windows will support linux soon
 bzdmgz	:D
 sanuj	we can't change shogun till it supports windows or can we?
 bzdmgz	it is quite similar
 sanuj	ohkay
 bzdmgz	shogun doesn't work on windows anyway
 sanuj	i see
 bzdmgz	because reasons haha
 sanuj	no problem then
 bzdmgz	we use pthreads and shit like that
 bzdmgz	massive overhaul
 sanuj	bzdmgz, so i'll talk to you tomorrow about class_list thing
 sanuj	if you are going now
 bzdmgz	okie
 bzdmgz	yeah
 sanuj	cool
 sanuj	take care
 bzdmgz	see you
 sanuj	bye
