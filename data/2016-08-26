@wiking	yeeey
@wiking	actually upgrading to 1.8.0 gtest had a sideeffect of passing freebsd \o/
 CaBa	:)
 CaBa	wiking: i'm still confused with the whole memory / garbage handling in shogun...
 CaBa	wiking: how does SG_UNREF for example ensure that the pointer it's handling is actually dynamically allocated memory?

@wiking	CaBa, sorry was away
 CaBa	np
 CaBa	welcome back
 CaBa	wiking: can it be...
 CaBa	wiking: that your patch from yesterday causes the build files to be put in the source directory?
@wiking	it did prior to that as well :)
@wiking	why?
@wiking	having some issues?
@wiking	config.h and versionstring.h
 CaBa	hmmm... not sure yet, might be that i did a 'cmake .' in my source dir accidentally earlier and now it's touching caches there... let me git clean...
 CaBa	wiking: yeah never mind. was my mistake

 CaBa	wiking: wow. night person, ha? ;)
 sanuj	he never sleeps :D
 sanuj	or sometimes on his keyboard :P
 CaBa	when i debug a BAD_ACCESS and end up at a malloc() call, this must be wrong, right?
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@117.203.13.213] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	how did u do that?
@wiking	i mean bad access?
 CaBa	        CBinaryLabels * resultLabels = machine.apply_locked_binary(subsetIndices);
 CaBa	bt: https://gitlab.unique-internet.de/snippets/4
@wiking	mmm interesting
 CaBa	memory.cpp:104 is malloc()
 CaBa	which is strange
@wiking	can u recreate a minimum example
@wiking	that u could share/
 CaBa	but as i said, i'm still quite confused about shoguns memory management
 CaBa	i never used SG_REF so far, maybe that's my troubl e:P
 CaBa	i'll try to create an mwe if i don't figure it out...
 CaBa	wiking: the line of code is wrong prob due to multithreading
 CaBa	wiking: is there a quick way to entirely turn of parallelization?
@wiking	set_num_threads(1)
 CaBa	any SGObject.get_global_parallel()?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	or you can do global
@wiking	sg_parallel->set_num_threads
 CaBa	wiking: fixed. i didn't labels->remove_subset() when apparently i had to - so i kept subsetting recursively or so...
