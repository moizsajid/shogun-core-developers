 yoo_	hi all
 yoo_	I have PR a fix for mcmkl based on alex's patch 0.10.0
 yoo_	it works fine for me but it seems that with new changes in shogun repo with multiclass machine there is an issu with "set_multiclass_confidences"
 yoo_	to be fix ... (training is ok)

 Guest85567	hi, I tried to install shogun 2.0.0 on a centos 6.3 system. Via yum only python 2.6 is available, so I installed python 2.7.3 by hand and numpy as well. When I try to install shogun with python 2.7 it says that the development packages are missing. But they are available (I installed it via  rpm package that I build myself and the devel package is available). The building with python 2.6 is working. Can anybody hint me in the right direction to get it com

 sonne|work	well guest - it works here under python 2.6 and centos just fine - so don't bother
-!- michelis [~michelis@mh001.data.gy] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: can you reproduce any of the current crashers on the buildbot?
-!- michelis is now known as tobias
-!- tobias is now known as Guest85567
 Guest85567	sorry for the disruption bad I had to reboot unexpected. Thanks for the answer. But I have one question more. one of our developers wants to use it with python 2.7.3. And I really don't know the tool. So it doesn't make a difference with wich version of python I build the interfaces?
 sonne|work	Guest85567: from shogun's side it doesn't make a difference
 sonne|work	maybe he needs some new python2.7 stuff...
 sonne|work	anyway what you need to compile it w/ python2.7 is to have python2.7's devel files and its shared library and of course numpy devel stuff around
 Guest85567	that was the problem, I have the python2.7 devel stuff around, but when I install numpy it seems not to get/install the devel files, wether I install it with pip/easy_install or from source.
 Guest85567	It seems the the python_modular interface compiled with python 2.6 works with python2.7 :). Thanks.

@sonney2k	blackburn, I've just managed to reproduce the issue on the buildbot - it only happens when I compile with optimization flags enabled!
 blackburn	ha!
@sonney2k	totally clueless how this can be fixed
@sonney2k	template hell I guess
 blackburn	there is no such thing :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am trying operator overloading instead of templates now...
 wiking	sonne|work: mmm always use volatile ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: which example fails on your machine?
 blackburn	wiking: volatile? what for?
@sonney2k	wiking, why?
@sonney2k	blackburn, all the ones that fail on the buildbot
 blackburn	I just compiled with optimizations on
 blackburn	and it works
 blackburn	it was clang though
 blackburn	ah stoop stop
 blackburn	no, still working
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	okay gcc
@sonney2k	4.7.2  here...
@sonney2k	gcc 4.4.5 on the bb / or gcc 4.5 / 4.6
 wiking	because sometimes there's a problem with setting the variables ;)
 wiking	and that usually happens when u let gcc to decide for optimizing variables
 wiking	so sometimes u have to use some forced vars
 wiking	otherwise gcc will do it's magic
 wiking	heheh
 wiking	streaming features ;)
 blackburn	sonney2k: works here
@sonney2k	nah overloading T* foo() is a bad idea - it would require translating to foo(T* &)
@sonney2k	blackburn, haha
@sonney2k	doesn't help us to fix the builds...
 blackburn	well I am curious how to reproduce then
@sonney2k	blackburn, well it is crashing on any buildbot so lets just get some backtrace / valgrind log from there
 blackburn	and even no valgrind errors
@sonney2k	blackburn, you sure that you did not have --disable-optimization in your configure flags?
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	boah its compiling slowly..
@sonney2k	blackburn, that's the one I am getting http://dpaste.com/833436/
 blackburn	can yuo shoud valgrind one
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	show
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	http://dpaste.com/833437/
@sonney2k	looks exactly like the template is not taken
 blackburn	sonney2k: multiclasslabels.cpp:17
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes?
 blackburn	is it ok?
@sonney2k	    m_multiclass_confidences = SG_MALLOC(SGVector<float64_t>, num_labels);
@sonney2k	this line?
 blackburn	yeah I mean we calloc and then inplace new
@sonney2k	calloc where?
 blackburn	malloc
@sonney2k	we just do SG_MALLOC
@sonney2k	so that will now call new[]()
 blackburn	17-18 inplcae new
@sonney2k	ehh no such lines in my code
 wiking	doh
 wiking	hey
@sonney2k	did you git pull?
 wiking	isn't it confusing a bit
 blackburn	oh
@sonney2k	wiking, what?
 wiking	that SGSparseMatrix (number of examples, feature_dim)
 wiking	while SGMatrix(feautres_dim, num of examples)
 blackburn	my git got crazy
@sonney2k	wiking, urgs
@sonney2k	yes it is
 wiking	this is why this guy's code is crashing
@sonney2k	sgsparsematrix stuff should follow sgmatrix...
 wiking	ok
 wiking	support email has been sent
 wiking	to the list
 wiking	but yeah
 wiking	somebody fix the sgsparsematrix api
 wiking	as this is really confusing
 wiking	...
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but until we can compile shogun again it is low priority
@sonney2k	blackburn, can you reproduce it now?
 wiking	:DDD
 wiking	hahaha
 wiking	you guys fscked up shogun HEAD
@sonney2k	wiking, and now we make you fix it.
 wiking	no way
 wiking	i regred that i rebased already your first attempt for implementing inline malloc; )
@sonney2k	hehe
@sonney2k	wiking, if you figure out why it works in debug mode but not w/ optimizations then we are good
 wiking	what is not working?
@sonney2k	wiking, it ignores my template specialization
@sonney2k	no idea whats wrong though
@sonney2k	but too tired to keep trying now
 wiking	sonney2k: which code?
 wiking	i wasn't following the last 2 days commits
 wiking	dude
 wiking	seriously
 wiking	template by #define
 wiking	and u r sure you are only passing classes to an sg_malloc...?
 wiking	template <class T> T* sg_generic_malloc(size_t len, const char* file, int line) = >
 wiking	template <typename T>
