 lisitsyn	omg guys don't come to austria they have beardy girls :D
 thoralf	pickle27: Sorry, in my restricted perception it's night now.  And I insist that it's night everywhere now.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: lol.  Show pictures. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: see the winner of eurovision ;)
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Already one year over since last one...?
 thoralf	Didn't know. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: europe goes crazy :D
 thoralf	lol
 thoralf	I see.
 thoralf	Wurst
 thoralf	That's german for "sausage".
 lisitsyn	thoralf: haha
 thoralf	Conchita Wurst sounds like some spicy sausage from somewhere around Brazil.
 thoralf	Born 1988?
 thoralf	I'm getting old.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: russian candidates are born 1997 :D
 thoralf	(S)he wasn't even born when I went to school.
 lisitsyn	this is the case I am old
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I am puzzled by the meaning of his beard :D
 thoralf	lisitsyn: It's a drag.  I'd be puzzled about people who were not puzzled.  So you're okay. ;)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: no no
 lisitsyn	I mean it is okay to pretend to be a woman
 lisitsyn	but beard :D
 thoralf	Well, my interpretation: Being so proud to show that  you successfully pretended to be a woman... ;)
 thoralf	So proud to show everyone.
 lisitsyn	thoralf: haha that's really getting crazy
 thoralf	(I made this up within last 60 seconds.  So it's a low-quality interpretation. ;))
 thoralf	But the interpretation at least needs to be a bit paradox to be plausible. :)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yeah haha
 thoralf	It's like: You see two doors.  There are two guards.  One is lying every time, the other one says the truth.  Find the door with the right interpretation.
 pickle27	lol I know that perception
 thoralf	pickle27: Back from lunch, eh? ;)
 pickle27	Im actually cooking steak!
 thoralf	Great man!
* thoralf had bbq today.
 thoralf	But steak is cool.  Real steak?  2cm thick?
 pickle27	yeah its probably 2.5

 amyc	Hi, I am installing shogun java modular and having some problem, I have the latest cygwin. Could some one help me?
 dhruv13j	amyc: why not use linux?
 dhruv13j	amyc: are you set on getting it to work on windows?
 amyc	Our company development box are windows, we use jave/tomcat. I need to develop on my dev box, but we deploy on production machine on linux, so eventually I'll also need to build linux modular.
 dhruv13j	amyc: What problem are you facing on cygwin?
 amyc	cmake give me error on FindJNI: missing JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY,
 amyc	I edited FindJNI.cmake file to set the following parameters based on my java home directory: JAVA_AWT_LIBRARY      = the path to the jawt library #  JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY      = the path to the jvm library #  JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH     = the include path to jni.h #  JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2    = the include path to jni_md.h #  JAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH = the include path to jawt.h
 amyc	where the path to jawt library is the directory of jawt.lib, etc. It seems cmake finished configuration.
 amyc	Now I run "make" and got another error on io.File.cpp: 'strdup' was not declared in this scope.

 amyc	dhruv13j: not sure if you are still there to help me, I managed to progress by editting CFile.cpp and several other files for adding std header. and got to the point with another error: Scanning dependencies of target java_modular_src make[2]: Circular src/interfaces/java_modular/swig_typemaps.i <- src/interfaces/java_modular/swig_typemaps.i dependency dropped.

 dhruv13j	amyc: sorry, was away... have you read this: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/3.0.0/faq.html
 dhruv13j	amyc: libshogun itself is not compiling properly, and I don't think you should be editing source files... is your cpp environment sane? try getting it to compile plain shogun first (ie. don't add the JAVA_MODULAR=ON option while building)
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@115.248.45.78] has joined #shogun
 dhruv13j	amyc: first debug cmake, get it to generate the build files properly
 dhruv13j	amyc: then, try and resolve issues with the c++ environment on your version of cygwin... which one by the way?
-!- pickle27 [~pickle27@192-0-136-118.cpe.teksavvy.com] has joined #shogun
 amyc	dhruv13j: thank you very much for replying. I just downloaded cygwin from their website 2 days ago. checking cygcheck --version shows it is 1.7.29, I am new on the whole thing, sorry maybe doing/saying some stupid things. I also downloaded shogun 3.2.0 two days ago. My system is windows 7 laptop, with java 7. The cygwin gcc version is 4.8.2. If I use the original downloaded code for make, I got the errors such as " error: 'strdup' was 
 amyc	dhruv13j: since I am a java developer, I don't know how to fix c++ environment in cygwin.
 dhruv13j	amyc: I can try and help you with that... will take me a while though, since i am new to cygwin too
 dhruv13j	amyc: I'll try building it on windows + cygwin and get back... you will find me here mostly :-)
