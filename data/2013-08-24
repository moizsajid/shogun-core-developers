 iglesiasg	hello hello
-!- mode/#shogun [+o iglesiasg] by ChanServ
@sonney2k	wiking, must have been important :D
@wiking	sonney2k: oh yeah i remember
@wiking	sonney2k: should we use DynArray<> as part of the public api or rather CDynamicArray?
@wiking	and what's the best way to have a DynArray< DynArray<> >

@wiking	anybody around
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
@wiking	lisitsyn: ok so here's the problem
@wiking	i have a set of sparse-like vector (that's now basically a DynArray)
@wiking	it's for storing indices
@wiking	i have like N of them
@wiking	i'd like to store them in an array or list
@wiking	and then i have to convert it to SGVector<> for being able to do add_subset()
 lisitsyn	crazy :)
@wiking	how should i store the array of DynArrays/
@wiking	?
 lisitsyn	and you need to serialize it, right?
@wiking	i've tried CDynamicArray<DynArray<index_t> >
@wiking	but that doesn't work
@wiking	yeah it'd be great to serialize
-!- van51 [~van51@ppp-94-66-12-14.home.otenet.gr] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	why doesn't it work?
@wiking	btw dunno, parameters->add_vector() is complaining
@wiking	in CDynamicArray...
 lisitsyn	ahhh
@wiking	anyhow
 lisitsyn	yes I guess add_vector  works only with simple types
@wiking	yeps
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	so yeah i have no clue
@wiking	of course std::vector<std:vector<index_t> > would work...
@wiking	:P
@wiking	ah and the problem is that i dont know the sizeof of DynArray...
 lisitsyn	that's basically what ya need :)
-!- pickle27 [~kevin@d67-193-243-174.home3.cgocable.net] has joined #shogun
@wiking	i mean prior creating it
@wiking	hence i cannot use SGVector
@wiking	:P
 lisitsyn	I see no workaround for this right now
@wiking	basically i'm trying to implement this: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#ooberr
@wiking	for that i have to get the indicies for the elements that are out of bag for each bag...
@wiking	lisitsyn: btw bool* array1; bool* array2; bool* array2 |= array1; would work? :)
@wiking	noup it seems not :)
-!- lambday [67157f36@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.127.54] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	wiking: what's it?
@wiking	nada
@wiking	i'll have to use some STL it seems
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah we've got to find a way to employ stl w/o pain

@sonney2k	wiking, never use DynArray but rather DynamicArray/DynamicObjectArray when you want to serialize
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i've figured because of sgobject...
@wiking	news on the new server? :)
@wiking	btw: any of u who has linux plz update integration data

@sonney2k	wiking, yeah it is ordered
@wiking	\o/
-!- gsomix_ [~gsomix@109.169.254.249] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@wiking	sonney2k: and how can i store an SGVector in an array?
@wiking	any kind of array
@wiking	or list
@wiking	as currently i dont see that happening in shogun
@sonney2k	wiking, well store it in a DynamicArray and good
@sonney2k	wiking, any clues why I am getting this?
@sonney2k	 git push github master
@sonney2k	To git@github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun-data.git
@sonney2k	 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
@sonney2k	error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:shogun-toolbox/shogun-data.git'
@sonney2k	ohh I got got got it
@sonney2k	I wasn't on a branch
 lisitsyn	typical for shogun-data
 lisitsyn	;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, :P
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it happened to me like 10 times or so
 lisitsyn	no idea why
 lisitsyn	I don't remember what's the case it tracks off the branch

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: require new data version
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, maybe it looses track of the branch when one does git submodule udpate or even git pull in shogun/ ?
 lisitsyn	git submodule update I think yes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well checkout master
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and tehn git pull in the shogun dir
@sonney2k	lets see if it changes things
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: do you have any insight whether something based on SO svm is applicable to frame-rate object detection?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well I guess you would have to prefilter quite a bit and you could only use rather simple models
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it seems it is time for me to apply shogun for something commercial
 lisitsyn	essentially it is just object detection so lets see how it goes
@sonney2k	just do it :)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I have to find a solution in next 15 days :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, errm tough opencv?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what?
 lisitsyn	that's a task for opencv true
 lisitsyn	but may be I can learn some svm or so
