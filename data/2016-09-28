@wiking	HeikoS: man
@wiking	HeikoS: you have never answered my question
@wiking	regarding the invoice
@HeikoS	wiking: jojo
@wiking	and we should send that asap
@HeikoS	sure
@HeikoS	remind me :)
@wiking	doing it now :)
@HeikoS	I looked at it and it looked fine
@HeikoS	what was the question
@wiking	ok had some questions there
@wiking	dont remember what :D
@HeikoS	haha :D
@wiking	but it's in the email i've sent to u
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	wiking: cant find any email with a question
@HeikoS	apart from "need to book hotel" ;)
@wiking	ahaha
@wiking	ok lemme check
@HeikoS	ah here we go
@wiking	oh ok
@HeikoS	I replied to one
@HeikoS	just use fernandos name
@HeikoS	that is fine
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then i'm gonna fill out the spreadsheet -> pdf
@wiking	and upload
@HeikoS	yep good!
@HeikoS	they will complain if something is not good
@HeikoS	(that might have happened before ;)
@wiking	ok done
@wiking	submitted
@wiking	HeikoS: ok so i started to put together a patch for big input
@HeikoS	wiking: nice one thanks for taking care
@HeikoS	wiking: big input as in huge sparse?
@wiking	man we are mixing int64_t and int32_t all the time
@HeikoS	wiking: I know
@HeikoS	I think index_t should be 64bit
@wiking	so yeah i'm now switching things to index_t
@wiking	and then i'm compiling with -Woverflow
@HeikoS	wiking: needs some systematic refactoring
@HeikoS	ah nice
@wiking	and basically going one by one fixing
@HeikoS	wiking: ok cool
@HeikoS	did this fix this guys problem?
@wiking	not yeti mean i'm far from finishing that patch
@wiking	:))))
@wiking	i almost have to change every fucking class
@wiking	in the code :)
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	anyhow
@HeikoS	I guess this can be done incrementally?
@HeikoS	or does it break anything?
@wiking	i cannot get it compiled
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	because you need to change the interface etc
@wiking	so yeah it's gonna be a per directory patch
@wiking	:)
@wiking	but that's all
@wiking	but i leave it in the feature/BigInput branch
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	ok we can merge that in SF
@wiking	have it tested by him once it's ready
@wiking	etc
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	because i dont have a machine where
@HeikoS	I am on some meta language stuff atm
@wiking	i could test this
@HeikoS	to merge a few more cookbooks
@HeikoS	btw what about java script?
@HeikoS	shall I get these cookbooks working?
@wiking	ah js
@wiking	yeah there i'm working
@wiking	on typemapping
@HeikoS	because the patches that are merged in that feature branch are not really dealing with the full thing
@wiking	at least for v8+nodejs
@wiking	yeah not yet
@HeikoS	let me know when I shall do that, then we get a lot of tests for free
@wiking	yep
@wiking	btw
@wiking	so i was checking the
@wiking	https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/distributed/index.html
@wiking	and it's super heavy weight
@HeikoS	if I managed to figure out some generic template stuff, we also get implicit tests for the typemaps
@wiking	i would rather use this https://actor-framework.org/
@HeikoS	there was some weird stuff going on in java
@HeikoS	yeah distributed
@HeikoS	I am not too interested in that for now
@HeikoS	so I leave it to you :)
@HeikoS	I care more about the autodiff
@HeikoS	and having an API to build computation graphs
@HeikoS	but would be good
@HeikoS	to get some multicore stuff easy at least
@wiking	yeah but caf is the same as computation graph
@HeikoS	sure
@wiking	anyhow
@wiking	i'll see when i have time
@wiking	wanna fix first the bug in crossval multithreading
@wiking	(dunno yet wtf is going on)
@HeikoS	ah yeah
@wiking	so we can merge the windows branch
@wiking	then this big input
@HeikoS	yes that'd be huge
@wiking	and then javascript
@wiking	i mean this is the only fucking thing
@wiking	that crossval multithread failing
@wiking	:S
@HeikoS	I want to fix things to merge OXPOHS patches so that she remains interested in shogun and comes baack!
@wiking	hahaha yeah
@wiking	the serialization
@HeikoS	wiking: thats probably related to Saurabh7's fix
@wiking	and the linalg
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	Ill merge things bit by bit for this stuff
@wiking	yeah those things should get in line soon
@HeikoS	yep
@wiking	so we can merge those into develop
@HeikoS	I have a bit of time before SG
@HeikoS	SF
@HeikoS	so can prepare
@wiking	btw we are no aiming 5.0.0 right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	definitely!
@HeikoS	I made a milestone in fact
@HeikoS	;)
@HeikoS	with one issue
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: we should also migrate the parameters
@HeikoS	and the cereal stuff
@HeikoS	maybe even before 5.0
@HeikoS	I also want to clean up the test directory a bit
@HeikoS	get rid of all but the meta ones, any thoughts on that?
@HeikoS	remove static interfaces as well
@HeikoS	lots of old code, lots of questions on that often
@HeikoS	remove "_modular" and just support swig interfaces
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	cleaning up
@HeikoS	you know the website status?
@HeikoS	can I edit it already on github? :)
@wiking	yep
@wiking	i mean static dropping woudl be great
@wiking	edit what?
@HeikoS	the text
@HeikoS	content
@wiking	ah
@wiking	no auto delivery yet
@wiking	but that shoudl be easy
@wiking	question is
@HeikoS	I want to show it to some people and then edit based on their suggestions
@wiking	lisitsyn: wtf do we miss?
@wiking	apart from autodeploy?
@wiking	HeikoS: as you can see this works
@wiking	beta.shogun.ml
@HeikoS	ah cool
@wiking	but if you change content
@HeikoS	and deplyong?
@wiking	on github
@wiking	will not get deployed
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	is there a preview or so?
@wiking	can look into that
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	just wanna see what lisitsyn
@wiking	says
@HeikoS	yeah ok
@HeikoS	and the master branch release mechanism?
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	haha i like your tweet ! :)
@wiking	ah that was in august
@wiking	was a productive shogun month: )
@HeikoS	pitty I was gone
@HeikoS	rahul also has a massive feature branch that is ready for mergining
@HeikoS	mostly science code
@HeikoS	but might get us a few citations
@HeikoS	since its cool stuff
@HeikoS	and fast as fuck
@HeikoS	just need to push him to document the API

@HeikoS	wiking: still awake?
@HeikoS	wiking: seems like we dont have a typemap in csharp for bool[] and BoolVector

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: hihi
@HeikoS	how are things?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: looking into this problem with the bool vectors, it is more tricky than I thought
@HeikoS	but I might have a hack
 OXPHOS	@HeikoS: hey hello! back to work
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: nice, all good over there?
 OXPHOS	@HeikoS: I might disappear once in a while but keep going
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: yeah no worries
 OXPHOS	yes just kinda busy in the mornings [now], so it's hard to reach to you guys
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: whats the best time to talk for you?
@HeikoS	in a few hours?
@HeikoS	I am not that far off from your timezone
@HeikoS	so my evenings (in a few hours) should work
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: Ill try to send a fix for the problem soon
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: shall we aim to get the linalg in as well over the next few weeks?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: we are preparing a release and that should definitely be a feature of it
 OXPHOS	so there is something wrong with the java vector?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: there are two problems
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: and the java problem ;)
 OXPHOS	usually 10 min from now till 2h10 min from now are better, 12pm - 2pm
@HeikoS	the java problem I fixed
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: cool Ill try to catch you t hen
 OXPHOS	thx
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: see my reply and listing how the caid_tree works for me
@HeikoS	then there are problems with csharp
@HeikoS	it is quite nice how the meta example coverage reveals all these problems inside shogun, but it is also a bit annoying that there are so many ;)
 OXPHOS	haha true
 OXPHOS	I am checking
 OXPHOS	and I don't know why meta examples start failing for me after the short break of last month
 OXPHOS	it seems like when it runs into unknown symbols, but the symbols are just numbers this time
 OXPHOS	and i updated ply, which didn't help
@HeikoS	remove the build dir
@HeikoS	that should solve it
 OXPHOS	I did
@HeikoS	and still?
 OXPHOS	yes still the same problem
@HeikoS	I mean the build works
@HeikoS	did you change your computer?
@HeikoS	re-run cmake?
 OXPHOS	no i didn't
 OXPHOS	but I can try a different computer
@HeikoS	then it doesnt make sense, so I guess it is a sneaky little setup issue
@HeikoS	yeah try that
@HeikoS	works on mine
 OXPHOS	I removed the build and repeated cmake
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: do you remember which meta example had a static call in it?
 OXPHOS	i ll try a hard reset i guess some time
 OXPHOS	no
@HeikoS	hard reset?
 OXPHOS	yeah just reset --hard upstream/develop and see what will happen
@HeikoS	kk
@HeikoS	OXPHOS:  I am trying to solve your vector problem like this now:
@HeikoS	BoolVector ft = BoolVector:const_vector(0, 2)
@HeikoS	where I added this method to SGVector
@HeikoS	we need the typemap to do hand constructed bool[] ones
@HeikoS	see my issue
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
 OXPHOS	@HeikoS: not really..but seems like a big change
@HeikoS	argh there are other issues with this solution as well
@HeikoS	sigh
@HeikoS	so annoying that this mini thing blocks so much stuff
 OXPHOS	and also ture for the linalg - you want me to move the codes to .cpp? no more header only? This is the only way I can see with the Macros
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: what do you mean by "no more header only
@HeikoS	sorry I dont have this on my radar right now, can you explain again?
 OXPHOS	@HeikoS: so to apply linalg library shogun-wisely, I can include it in CMath.h, which is included by a lot of algos
@HeikoS	no we dont want that
@HeikoS	I want to include some linalg.h in the algorithm itself
 OXPHOS	okay
 OXPHOS	but if we include linalg.h in too many files, the compiling is still going to be slow, because for every single file included linalg.h, it needs to go through all the types specified by macros
@HeikoS	"it needs to go" means what here?
@HeikoS	dont we guard against multiple including?
@HeikoS	not sure I understand the proiblem
 OXPHOS	yeah that's the thing. So just assume we include linalg.h in cmath.h, so linalg.h should only be included once right, because of the guard
 OXPHOS	but actually, if there's warnings jump out of "DEFINE_FOR_ALL_PTYPE(BACKEND_GENERIC_MAX, SGVector)", you can see the warnings poped out for every single file that included cmath.h
@HeikoS	thats not good
@HeikoS	mmh are all the linalg header guarded against multiple inclusion?
@HeikoS	#ifndef LINALG_H__
@HeikoS	#define LINALG_H__
@HeikoS	....
@HeikoS	#endif
@HeikoS	?
@HeikoS	I am offline for 20 now, let's discuss when I am back

@HeikoS	OXPHOS: still around=
@HeikoS	?
 OXPHOS	@HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: so is the linalg stuff guarded in the way I mentioned ?
 OXPHOS	the LinalgNameSpace.h is actually missing the guards but unlikely it is causing the trouble because it's more downstream. But I am going to fix it and try
@HeikoS	I just wonder why you will get thing multiple times -- that is not the way the c++ preprocessor works
 OXPHOS	I asked a friend a while ago and he told me the macros in .h files will be re-built everytime it is included
@HeikoS	ah really
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	I have a hard time imagining that
@HeikoS	if you guard it, then it should remain hidden
 OXPHOS	I tried to google but maybe didn't hit the appropriate keywords for searching..so didn't find any useful info about it
