@wiking	HeikoS, h0	13:37
@wiking	y0	13:37
@HeikoS	wiking: jojo	13:37
@wiking	ok things are rolling :)	13:37
@HeikoS	they are :)	13:37
@HeikoS	fingers crossed about our gsoc application	13:37
@wiking	ah yeah	13:37
@wiking	so 2 things	13:37
@wiking	a) Gunnar	13:37
@wiking	b) joining an umbrella org	13:38
@wiking	and c) i've prepared a draft for the new release	13:38
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/releases	13:38
@wiking	for the release actually i need to fix 2 things	13:38
@wiking	1) modular octave force 1 thread	13:38
@HeikoS	wiking: looks good	13:39
@HeikoS	wiking: you are on fire ;)	13:39
@wiking	2) fix all the failing stuff that are caused in the analytics	13:39
@HeikoS	yes I saw the email	13:39
@wiking	build jobs	13:39
@wiking	ah and the last thing	13:39
@wiking	i need to look at the notebooks	13:39
@wiking	ipython	13:39
@wiking	i reckon they are now not being all generated	13:39
@wiking	ah and fuck	13:39
@wiking	the notebook jobs	13:40
@wiking	:<	13:40
@wiking	that actually is required for the PR job as well	13:40
@wiking	fucking old cmake on 7nn.de sonney2k !	13:40
@wiking	so yeah there are like 5 more tasks	13:40
@wiking	but after that	13:40
@wiking	it's releasable	13:40
@wiking	:DDDDD	13:40
@HeikoS	hehe	13:41
@sukey	Pull Request #3608 "Clean up KNN"  synchronized by MikeLing - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3608	13:41

@wiking	yeah that shit should go	13:48
@wiking	but we should get	13:48
@HeikoS	wiking: to get rid of all the cmake fuck	13:48
@HeikoS	for linalg	13:48
@wiking	Pan to fix the multithreading/atomicity stuff done	13:48
@HeikoS	ah yes	13:48
@wiking	i can try rebasing	13:48
@wiking	the feature branch	13:48
@HeikoS	wiking: I mean it is not yet used in develop a lot	13:48
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah good idea	13:49
@wiking	ah and there i think	13:49
@wiking	we should actually use the new feature of cmake 3.1	13:49
@wiking	https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/variable/CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD.html	13:49
@wiking	so you can just do this	13:49
@wiking	set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)	13:49
@wiking	:>	13:49
@HeikoS	thats cool!	13:49
@HeikoS	wiking: ah man sweet with the python ppa	13:50
@HeikoS	Ill add to the website readme I guess?	13:50
@wiking	yeah and the full restruct of cmake	13:50
@wiking	makes things much much more cleaner	13:50
@wiking	yeah we should	13:50
@wiking	now i'm working on the jupytherhub	13:50
@wiking	:)	13:50
@wiking	that should fucking kill it :)	13:50
@wiking	jupyterhub + aws	13:50
@wiking	and then we blog a bit about it	13:50
@HeikoS	wiking: so the python module is in the existing ppa, the same package	13:51
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah man	13:51
@wiking	yes	13:51
@HeikoS	actually	13:51
@wiking	so just add-apt-repository	13:51
@wiking	and then	13:51
@HeikoS	maybe lea can write that, she wanted to do something	13:51
@wiking	apt-get install python-shogun	13:51
@wiking	yeah that'd be huge help	13:51
@wiking	and	13:51
@wiking	we should put there the credz for AWS	13:51
@wiking	for giving us this	13:51
@HeikoS	yep yep yep	13:51
@wiking	so maybe we could get creds this year as well	13:51
@wiking	because you know	13:51
@HeikoS	yep absolutely	13:51
@wiking	that our fundings are running low in may	13:51
@wiking	and man	13:51
@wiking	we barely used 1k	13:52
@HeikoS	good timing because we need to reapply for credits	13:52
@wiking	but they are gonna be liek	13:52
@wiking	"wtf u asked for 15k	13:52
@wiking	u used 1k	13:52
@wiking	:D	13:52
@HeikoS	man its going well :)	13:53
@HeikoS	just doiscussing with lea the post	13:53
@HeikoS	brb	13:53
@wiking	HeikoS, $1,199.80	13:53
@wiking	:)	13:53
@wiking	used creds	13:53
lisitsyn	hey	13:53
@wiking	sup?	13:53
lisitsyn	what's going on	13:54
lisitsyn	:)	13:54
@wiking	lisitsyn, idk if you realised but i've just merged the other day commits of yours from 2015	13:54
@wiking	:)	13:54
lisitsyn	really	13:54
lisitsyn	which ones?	13:54
lisitsyn	oh	13:54
lisitsyn	oh god IT WAS 2015	13:54
lisitsyn	crazyiest shietz	13:55
@wiking	:>	13:55
@wiking	but yeah gut stuff	13:55
@wiking	man	13:55
@wiking	wanted to ask you	13:55
@wiking	but now i cannot recall wtf	13:56
lisitsyn	haha	13:56
lisitsyn	wiking: so what are you thoughts on bazel or stuff like that?	13:56
@wiking	mmm good shit	13:56
@wiking	but man	13:56
@wiking	i dont wanna do it	13:56
@wiking	you know how shitty it is	13:57
@wiking	...	13:57
@wiking	fuck	13:57
lisitsyn	yeah it's like shitload of work	13:57
@wiking	no fucking way	13:57
@wiking	actually now	13:57
@wiking	cmake is in a very very good state	13:57
@wiking	it's almost totally devided	13:57
@wiking	into subprojects	13:57
lisitsyn	yeah true	13:57
@wiking	libshogun, python	13:57
lisitsyn	no need to bother	13:57
@wiking	everything	13:57
@wiking	i removed a lot of shit from the main cmakelists.txt	13:57
@wiking	(the one in the root)	13:57
lisitsyn	one other thought I have	13:57
lisitsyn	we may store our basic stuff in protos	13:57
@wiking	now you can actually build separately modular interfaces from libshogun	13:58
lisitsyn	I mean it may be some logic over protobufs	13:58
@wiking	yeah	13:58
@wiking	i'm totally ++ for that	13:58
lisitsyn	this way people can introspect anything	13:58
@wiking	makes things very clean	13:58
@wiking	and yeah exactly	13:58
lisitsyn	ok glad you like it	13:58
@wiking	you dont care about for swig interface at that time	13:58
@wiking	you just get the generated code	13:58
@wiking	and fuck all	13:58
@wiking	you use that directly	13:58
@wiking	there are couple of things i head in mind actuall	13:58
@wiking	y	13:59
lisitsyn	are you talking about protobuf interfaces?	13:59
lisitsyn	that's even better	13:59
@wiking	yes	13:59
@wiking	i would totally use	13:59
@wiking	.proto	13:59
@wiking	for defining interface	13:59
@wiking	why not?	13:59
lisitsyn	yeah sure	13:59
@wiking	then you can even rpc	13:59
lisitsyn	it is good as well	13:59
@wiking	and then all that shit	13:59
@wiking	is totally transparent for you	13:59
@wiking	is it called locally	13:59
@wiking	is it called on the moon	13:59
@wiking	you dont fucking care	13:59
lisitsyn	not always good but	13:59
lisitsyn	still	13:59
lisitsyn	but again not only that	13:59
lisitsyn	but	14:00
lisitsyn	another thing	14:00
lisitsyn	we may store everything in protos	14:00
@wiking	but what do you mean by storing?	14:00
lisitsyn	this way you may easily hack any classifier	14:00
lisitsyn	well	14:00
lisitsyn	say some state of classifier	14:00
lisitsyn	weights etc	14:00
lisitsyn	make it exposable	14:00
@wiking	ah and u use proto for that?	14:00
lisitsyn	yes	14:00
@wiking	sure	14:00
@wiking	that sounds very reasonable for me	14:00
@wiking	:)	14:00
lisitsyn	so it is like some code operating on protobufs	14:01
@wiking	yeah	14:01
lisitsyn	sounds like google	14:01
@wiking	let's have like	14:01
@wiking	JIT for proto	14:01
@wiking	right?	14:01
@wiking	:D	14:01
lisitsyn	haha	14:01
lisitsyn	why	14:01
@wiking	i mean you can totally do that btw	14:01
@wiking	nativeJIT + protoc	14:01
@wiking	and fuck all	14:01
@wiking	:)	14:01
lisitsyn	not sure what are advantages	14:01
lisitsyn	just to speed it up?	14:01
@wiking	ha well	14:02
@wiking	if you do autodiff	14:02

lisitsyn	ahh ok	14:02
@wiking	btw so i was wondering if we wanna look at this YOLO project https://arrow.apache.org/	14:03
@wiking	for interoperable memory storage	14:03
lisitsyn	I am not sure this should go into shogun	14:04
lisitsyn	I mean there are dozens of them	14:04
lisitsyn	we'd better make it interoperable with all that stuff	14:04
@wiking	yteah thats' what i meant	14:04
lisitsyn	no idea how though	14:04
@wiking	yeah that is a good question	14:05
@wiking	i mean now i'm looking into thrill	14:05
@wiking	and wondering how we could use like making batch models with shogun	14:06
@wiking	and then aggregate for example	14:06
@wiking	ah and one more thing i had in mind	14:06
@wiking	remember the other day	14:06
@wiking	i was wishing i would have reflection in c++	14:06
@wiking	so now that whenever in the distance future	14:06
@wiking	we manage to get this modularization done	14:07
@wiking	it'd be cool to have a tool as well	14:07
@wiking	that would help you to create pipelines	14:07
@wiking	of these modules	14:07
@HeikoS	wiking: first step, being able to serialize our models :)	14:07
lisitsyn	what reflection do you need?	14:07
@wiking	where the execution is actually a just a config file	14:07
@wiking	not code	14:07
@wiking	so wha ti meant is say	14:08
@HeikoS	wiking: you got a link to that openmp patch you mentioned earlier, cannot find it somehow	14:08
@wiking	- CSVFileread	14:09
@wiking	   - input: "file.csv"	14:09
@wiking	- Label	14:09
@wiking	  - labels: input[0]	14:09
@wiking	etc etc.	14:09
@HeikoS	ah got it	14:09
@wiking	oh cool	14:09
@wiking	lisitsyn, see what i mean?	14:10
@sukey	Wiki page: GSoC_2017_project_fundamental_usual_suspects edited on shogun-toolbox/shogun by karlnapf	14:10
lisitsyn	wiking: yeah	14:10
@wiking	but for that	14:10
@wiking	i need a way to do reflection right?	14:11
lisitsyn	ahh	14:11
lisitsyn	ok	14:11
@wiking	i mean with our sgserialization (class_list.cpp)	14:11
@wiking	we have our class factory	14:11
@wiking	so that's cool	14:11
@wiking	but then	14:11
@wiking	how do i know that i can call Label.set_labels(...)	14:12
@wiking	see what i mean?	14:12
@wiking	without reflection	14:12
@wiking	or fuckthis shit and jsut do this in a language that has reflection? :D	14:12
@sukey	Wiki page: GSoC_2017_detox edited on shogun-toolbox/shogun by karlnapf	14:12
@wiking	i mean the great stuff with tags	14:12
@wiking	that at least with that	14:13
@wiking	doing something like	14:13
@wiking	- CSVM:	14:13
@wiking	   - param1: value	14:13
@wiking	  - param2: value	14:13
@wiking	  - param3: value	14:13
@wiking	would be possible easily	14:13
@wiking	right?	14:13
@wiking	as that is just translated into	14:13
@wiking	obj.set(key, value)	14:13
@wiking	but when you wanna call a function with the right args	14:14
@wiking	things gets messy	14:14
@wiking	but yeah i dont see the reason why couldn't we have like a scripting language or something	14:15
@wiking	where we could create these pipelines	14:15
@wiking	because this would help easy prototyping	14:16
@wiking	and actually	14:16
@wiking	the good stuff with your idea of protos	14:16
@wiking	that you could use those interfaces to define these pipelines :)	14:16

@wiking	:>>>>>>>>>>>>	16:27
@wiking	HeikoS, btw i think	16:27
@wiking	we should try re-revert	16:27
@wiking	the commit for the multithreaded xval	16:27
@wiking	:D	16:27
@HeikoS	wiking: hehe :)	16:27
@HeikoS	yeah	16:27
@HeikoS	do it! :)	16:27
@HeikoS	or hsall I?	16:27
@HeikoS	wiking: btw had a cool idea for another gsoc project	16:28
@HeikoS	potentially a joint one where everyone has to participate	16:28
@wiking	self-driving cars? :D	16:28
@HeikoS	wiking: The low hanging fruit (TM)	16:28
@HeikoS	will put it in wiki later today	16:28
@wiking	cool	16:28
@HeikoS	wiking: btw for release	16:29
@HeikoS	I guess we put all issues in the 5.1 milestone to 5.2	16:29
@wiking	mmmmmmmm	16:29
@wiking	i would do a 6.0	16:29
@wiking	or here goes a scary question	16:29
@wiking	when do we add c++11 required?	16:29
@HeikoS	linalg merge	16:29
@wiking	and that wold be 5.2?	16:29
@wiking	*would	16:29
@HeikoS	yeah	16:29
@wiking	no	16:29
@wiking	then go 6.0	16:30
@HeikoS	also good	16:30
@wiking	because that's a big change	16:30
@wiking	different libc++ dependency	16:30
@wiking	etc	16:30
@HeikoS	I guess once we merge linalg, tags, and bigtest	16:30
@HeikoS	then we can do it for that	16:30
@HeikoS	I want to do these 3 before gsoc starts	16:30
@HeikoS	and maybe even bsd	16:30
@HeikoS	then 6.0 would be bsd	16:30
@wiking	mmm we can do	16:30
@wiking	6.0 with c++11	16:30
@wiking	7.0 with bsd	16:30
@wiking	no problem	16:30
@wiking	:D	16:30
@wiking	come on	16:30
@HeikoS	also good :)	16:30
@HeikoS	I know	16:30
@wiking	chrome is like	16:30
@wiking	what	16:30
@wiking	4 years old	16:30
@wiking	or 7	16:30
@wiking	and it's 5x. now	16:31
@wiking	:)	16:31
@HeikoS	hehe	16:31
@wiking	lol	16:31
@wiking	The browser was first publicly released on September 2, 2008	16:31
@wiking	so 9 years	16:31
@wiking	so yeah i would maybe force more major ++	16:31
@wiking	wouldn't hurt	16:31
@HeikoS	yeah good from my sidfe	16:32
@wiking	cool	16:32
@wiking	so who and when	16:32
@wiking	rebases	16:32
@wiking	linalg feature branch	16:32
@HeikoS	I can rebase linalg	16:32
@wiking	with current develop?	16:32
@wiking	can u?	16:32
@wiking	becaue then	16:32
@HeikoS	I can, just not today maybe	16:32
@wiking	after you fixed the rebase stuff	16:33
@wiking	add on top	16:33
@HeikoS	icml deadline next week aaaaah	16:33
@wiking	a commit	16:33
@wiking	that requires c++11	16:33
@wiking	the way i said	16:33
@wiking	and drop all that fucking c++11 feature tester in the cmake dir	16:33
@wiking	:D	16:33
@wiking	or just rebase	16:33
@wiking	and ping me	16:33
@HeikoS	wiking: shall we do that in linalg branch?	16:33
@wiking	and i can help	16:33
@HeikoS	yeah	16:33
@HeikoS	ok	16:33
@wiking	yeyey	16:33
@wiking	because linalg is fully c++11	16:33
@wiking	anyways no?	16:33
@HeikoS	wiking: shall I way for the lock thing?	16:33
@wiking	well rebase	16:34
@wiking	and then we'll see	16:34
@HeikoS	yeah true	16:34
@wiking	when pan comes up with the multithreading	16:34
@HeikoS	wiking: I think Pan is almost done with porting all the calls we had	16:34
@wiking	cool	16:34
@wiking	let's just have that thread-safe	16:34
@wiking	and we are good	16:34
@wiking	but i reckon	16:34
@HeikoS	kool!	16:34
@wiking	rebasing is not gonna be straightforward	16:34
@wiking	:)))	16:34
@HeikoS	dont konw	16:34
@wiking	lisitsyn, buuuuuuuujaaaaaaaaa	16:35
@HeikoS	I mean we didnt change too much in there	16:35
@HeikoS	more like adding/removing	16:35
@HeikoS	so lets see	16:35
@wiking	lisitsyn, with tags, how do you imagine api documentation? :D	16:35
@HeikoS	I can give it a go	16:35
@HeikoS	wiking: discussed that with him acutally	16:35
@HeikoS	but I forgot :)	16:35
@HeikoS	we had like a two layer thing	16:35
@HeikoS	core API docs	16:35
@HeikoS	and then one can have things for plugins documented by example	16:35
lisitsyn	uhm	16:37
lisitsyn	its dynamic	16:37
@wiking	yeah i know	16:37
@HeikoS	shogun goes python	16:37
@wiking	but man	16:37
@HeikoS	no more member variables	16:37
@wiking	we need a way to document it	16:37
@wiking	:)	16:37
@HeikoS	dynamic docs	16:37
@HeikoS	haha	16:37
@wiking	i mean what	16:37
@wiking	you	16:38
@wiking	say	16:38
@wiking	try any fucking combination	16:38
@wiking	?	16:38
@wiking	and see what sticks?	16:38
@wiking	:D	16:38
@HeikoS	I think first step is the SWIG interface docs for the core API	16:38
@HeikoS	that should be really polished	16:38
@HeikoS	and thats aside any algorithm implementations	16:39
@HeikoS	doxygen	16:39
@HeikoS	static	16:39
@HeikoS	and then for the implementations, we can either document the possibilities by example (thats minimal thing)	16:39
@HeikoS	or the thing can tell you what it does	16:39
@HeikoS	at runtime	16:39
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: thats kind of what we had in mind last time right?	16:40
@wiking	yeah but still	16:40
@HeikoS	wiking: dont like it? :D I would have guessed that	16:40
@wiking	nono	16:40
@wiking	what i mean is	16:40
@wiking	i dont fucking care of swig now	16:40
@wiking	api docs for it	16:40
@wiking	how do you create documentation	16:41
@wiking	for the c api?	16:41
@wiking	i mean dont tell me that you dont need it	16:41
@wiking	because then wtf?	16:41
@wiking	how do you write code for it?	16:41
@HeikoS	yeah true	16:41
@HeikoS	nono you need it	16:41
@HeikoS	all the stuff that is not exposed via swig but that you might want to use still, right?	16:42
@wiking	no i mean even the tags	16:42
@wiking	how do you know	16:42
@wiking	in the c++	16:42
@wiking	which tag is valid?	16:42
@HeikoS	which members are there?	16:42
@wiking	i mean vlid you will know	16:42
@wiking	by trial and error i guess	16:42
@wiking	but isn't there a better way? :D	16:42
@HeikoS	with the tag system we have, you cannot know that as they are generated at runtime	16:42
@wiking	and then what	16:43
@HeikoS	I mean we can have methods that give you the tags	16:43
@wiking	how do you know what are the params	16:43
@wiking	for CSVM?	16:43
@HeikoS	but not sure how to generate docs	16:43
@HeikoS	how is that problem solved in python docs?	16:44
@wiking	mmm define them in the docstrings	16:45
@wiking	afaik	16:45
@wiking	but then again	16:45
@wiking	you can just do that	16:45
@wiking	for vars that are func args	16:45
@wiking	dunno if you can actually define dynamically added	16:45
@wiking	member args	16:45
@wiking	and btw	16:45
@wiking	how the hell you validate	16:45
@wiking	that you have set all the vars	16:45
@wiking	for the model	16:45
@wiking	you'll have a validate tags? :d	16:45
@wiking	and even better i might add	16:46
@HeikoS	wiking: the model will default value all things of course	16:46
@wiking	how do you enforce in this case the type?	16:46
@HeikoS	and then you can change if wanted	16:46
@wiking	HeikoS, and then if you try to set	16:46
@wiking	set("C1", "adfg")	16:46
@wiking	then what happens?	16:46
@wiking	is it exception because not the right type?	16:46
@HeikoS	set is type safe at runtime	16:47
@HeikoS	yes	16:47
@wiking	or is it set to a string?	16:47
@wiking	?	16:47
@HeikoS	nono	16:47
@HeikoS	first	16:47
@HeikoS	because	16:47
@HeikoS	C1 is set in constructor	16:47
@HeikoS	so the type is fixed then	16:47
