 Dark_Lantern	Hey
 Dark_Lantern	I tried building shogun from source and all seemed to go well
 Dark_Lantern	But when I tried to run the first basic init program,
 Dark_Lantern	I got undefined reference errors.
 Dark_Lantern	Any help?

 wiking	yes
 Dark_Lantern	Hey
 Dark_Lantern	I am having trouble running shogun from source
 Dark_Lantern	While it is compiling normally
 Dark_Lantern	when I run the minimal.cpp program I get undefined reference errors
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	maybe it doesn't find the location where the lib is installed
 Dark_Lantern	Yes
 Dark_Lantern	Even pkg-config can't find the shogun libs
 wiking	how do you run ./configure?
 Dark_Lantern	So what mistake am I making in the installation?
 Dark_Lantern	Yes, that was the first thing I did
 wiking	but what's your full ./configure command looks like?
 wiking	how do you run it
 wiking	?
 wiking	if you just run simply ./configure
 wiking	then make and make install
 wiking	then your shogun libraries should be under /usr/local/lib
 wiking	check it if that's right

 sonne|work	Dark_Lantern: you have to do (in the shell) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_libshogun to get it to run and you should specify -Lpath_to_libshogun to your linker

 Dark_Lantern	echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH gives /usr/local/lib
 Dark_Lantern	I checked that folder and there are three shared object files
 Dark_Lantern	libshogun.so, libshogun.so.12 and libshogun.so.12.0
 Dark_Lantern	so I added the flag -L/usr/local/lib/libshogun.so
 Dark_Lantern	But still the same error. :(
 sonne|work	Dark_Lantern:  add sth like this to g++: -L/usr/local/lib
 sonne|work	Dark_Lantern: btw maybe from your shogun src dir

@sonney2k	heiko2, build failed...
 heiko2	sonney2k, seen
 heiko2	sonney2k, all these different configurations drive me mad
 heiko2	nothing fails here locally
 heiko2	I always check
 heiko2	but will fix soon
@sonney2k	heiko2, well just compile with --disable-lapack then
@sonney2k	heiko2, you only ever did generate such errors for systems w/o lapack/atlas
