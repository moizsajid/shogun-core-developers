 hushell	thoralf: good to know c++flit ! Thanks :)
@thoralf	:D
@thoralf	Let's keep it a secret. ;)
 hushell	thoralf: ;)
 jiaolong	thoralf: Hi, I am back again. I have tried several times and found at least this function will cause trouble https://github.com/Jiaolong/shogun/blob/nd_array/src/shogun/lib/SGNDArray.h#L122
 jiaolong	thoralf: Do you think the parameter 'index_t& max_at' could be the problem?
@thoralf	jiaolong: Well, in the header you said "T max_element(index_t& max_at);", but you only specialized "float64_t SGNDArray<float64_t>::max_element(int32_t &max_at)"
 jiaolong	thoralf: Or it can be lack of implement instances of other types, e.g., float32_t, int32_t, etc
@thoralf	Same here: I guess you should specialize this as well.
@thoralf	Try this: T SGNDArray<T>::max_element(int32_t &max_at) { T m = array[0]; ...
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, :)
@thoralf	Maybe complex_... will fail, but check how SGVector solves this.
@thoralf	complex_..t SGNDArray<T>::max_element(int32_t &max_at) { NOTIMPLEMENTED; }
@thoralf	Btw: before "T m = array[0];" you should check "len_array > 0".
 jiaolong	thoralf: Yes, you are right! The problem is because of the specilization. T SGNDArray<T>::max_element(int32_t &max_at) { T m = array[0]; ... WORKS!
@thoralf	Cool!
 jiaolong	thoralf: for int, float, the functions are acutally the same, should I implement max_element() twice?
@thoralf	jiaolong: No.  You should just implement it for general T.
 jiaolong	thoralf: But for other types, e.g., bool, it is not suitable
@thoralf	Only make exceptions in cases where the function may differ from the straight-forward approach.
@thoralf	Yes.
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, I see
@thoralf	bool SGNDArray<bool>::max_element(...) { SGNOTIMPLEMENTED; return false; }
@thoralf	Something like this to trick the compiler.
 jiaolong	thoralf: But multiple such types, I have do the same multiple times?
 jiaolong	thoralf: for instance 'char',
@thoralf	Yes :(
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, :D
@thoralf	Some people prefer to use macros for this, but I don't.
@thoralf	template <>
@thoralf	char SGVector<char>::twonorm(const char* x, int32_t len)
@thoralf	{
@thoralf	        SG_SNOTIMPLEMENTED
@thoralf	        return '\0';
@thoralf	}
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, I will also take a look at SGVector. Thank you so much!

@lisitsyn	how far are we from gpu things?
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:not far, maybe a week's work to gpu-ize the whole module
@lisitsyn	really?
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: will you by any chance have time for that?
@lisitsyn	this is out of gsoc already but well
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:yeah, most of the function that are needed are already there
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:I'm gonna do it soon, I'm just busy right now with a few things
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I see
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: if you have no time/will just let me know
@lisitsyn	maybe I'll try to take care of that
@lisitsyn	that's perfect ok as your work is rather done here
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:cool :)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I am like zero energy now :D hope theo will be there soon and it won't take much time
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:I don't think it'll take long :)
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: one guy at my job wants to try some nets
@lisitsyn	I told him you are working on this thing but he asked whether it is gpu-based
@lisitsyn	so actually everybody is interested in gpu things you know
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:yeah they're really usefull for neural nets
@lisitsyn	so I hope we will have gpu things ready in the next months
@lisitsyn	we are not theano but that's ok
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:yeah :)
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:we should probably get #2421 and #2418 merged soon before we start gpu-izing
 khalednasr	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2421
 khalednasr	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2418
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:the PRs are pushed against shogun-toolbox:feature/linalg, should I push them again for shogun-toolbox:develop?

@lisitsyn	khalednasr: I think thats' ok to push them against linalg
@lisitsyn	what's the point?
@lisitsyn	I probably miss this thing
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:shouldn't they be on develop if we want to use them?
@lisitsyn	well yeah
@lisitsyn	but linalg is going to be merged at some point as well
@lisitsyn	I hope :D
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:it's already merged :)
@lisitsyn	ahh damn
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	now I got it
@lisitsyn	yes then please rearrange them
@lisitsyn	khalednasr: its a shame I missed that :D
 khalednasr	lisitsyn:I should probably close them and push new ones?
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	the only sane way
