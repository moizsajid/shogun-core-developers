 wiking	yo
 wiking	n4nd0: ping
 n4nd0	wiking: tell me
 wiking	when u have time i want to discuss a patch with you
 n4nd0	I have time now
 wiking	it's a massively ugly patch
 wiking	but i really dont know what to do about this
 n4nd0	mine?
 wiking	nono mine
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	mmm i think i'll just pastebin it
 wiking	n4nd0: header http://pastebin.com/a8EUQEu7
 wiking	implementation http://pastebin.com/pBcjZ7LB
 wiking	this is the consequence of not being able to have class anything: public CStructuredModel, public CLatentModel
 n4nd0	yeah, I see
 n4nd0	but it could be bad to have multiple inheritance ...
 n4nd0	why are there two classes, CLSOModel and CLatentSOModel?
 wiking	well the naming is now stupid
 n4nd0	aham I see
 wiking	but basically CLSOModel goes for the structural machine
 n4nd0	one extends LatenModel and the other one the StructuredModel
 wiking	yes
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	and in order to just
 wiking	require one inheritance
 wiking	i hardwired CLatentSOModel into CLSOModel
 wiking	i.e. a user will only need to do an inharitance of CLatentSOModel
 wiking	and define all the relevant application specific functions
 n4nd0	I understand
 n4nd0	I guess that, providing how it is one right now, a user should do inheritance of CLSOModel or?
 n4nd0	I mean it since it is the class that has access to CLatentSOModel and not vice versa
 wiking	no
 wiking	it should do inheritance of CLatentSOModel
 wiking	the CLSOModel is completely fixed
 wiking	and basically it's 'just' a proxy class
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	and we cannot do multiple inheritance as then some modular interfaces will fail
 wiking	like java
 wiking	so we either go with something like this
 wiking	or i just throw out latentmodel as is
 wiking	and try to use structuredmodel
 wiking	the problem is that for simple LatentSVM
 wiking	most of the stuff in structuredmodel is not necessary
 wiking	and some other stuff are missing...
 wiking	so if possible i would like to keep it
 wiking	and maybe just rename CLSOModel to CLatentSOProxy
 wiking	;D
 n4nd0	that last renaming is good I think
 n4nd0	:)
 n4nd0	but I don't think it is such an ugly patch!
 n4nd0	I mean it is not a common thing to do
 n4nd0	but it is not a common situation either
 n4nd0	I think it is ok
 wiking	btw: this is lol: http://gizmodo.com/5937143/what-facebook-deals-with-everyday-27-billion-likes-300-million-photos-uploaded-and-500-terabytes-of-data
 wiking	500 Terabytes of Data /day
 n4nd0	dafuq
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	and it's all running on hadoop
 wiking	pretty impressive that it can handle it
 wiking	hahaha the hdfs is 100+ PB
 wiking	:DDD
 n4nd0	smart people
 wiking	yeah maybe shogun would fail on trying to use this :)
 wiking	StreamingFeatures ;)
 n4nd0	hehe
 wiking	ok well if u don't find this patch soooo ugly
 wiking	then i can actually commit
 wiking	just need to finish calculating the subgrad in the risk function
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	do u actually use in PrimalMosek the y value in the ResultSet?
 wiking	or just psi_truth and psi_pred
 wiking	?
 n4nd0	wiking: you mean the argmax right?
 wiking	yeah sorry
 wiking	yeah ResultSet->argmax
 n4nd0	I think not
 n4nd0	let me check
 wiking	yeah i've greped now
 wiking	didn't show up
 wiking	just wanted to make sure
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	just delta and psis
 n4nd0	that one is used in the moment of prediction
 n4nd0	in the PrimalMosek we are training so ignored
 wiking	k
 wiking	thnx a lot
 n4nd0	you are welcome
 n4nd0	this is just awesome
 n4nd0	http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/cultura/2012/08/21/la_restauracion_una_pintura_mural_una_iglesia_borja_acaba_chapuza_200865_308.html
 n4nd0	I don't know if you understand
 n4nd0	but just look at the picture...
 n4nd0	restoration, they said
 wiking	yeah i saw that... the old lady went a little bit creative ;)
 wiking	uricamic: here?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
 uricamic	wiking: yep
 wiking	so i'm just checking the multiclassmodel again, the risk function
 wiking	and the subgrad is  R'({\bf w}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \Psi(x_i, \hat{y}_i) - \Psi(x_i, y_i),
 wiking	right?
 uricamic	yep
 wiking	i wanted to say that couldn't we just use the CResultSet->psi_truth and CResultSet->psi_pred
 wiking	but then i've realised that argmax is not being called in the ::risk function
 uricamic	not yet, but eventually it should be called there
 wiking	ok ok
 wiking	then i guess we could use those two values
 wiking	as they are generated already by argmax
 uricamic	but the psi_pred has to be computed including the loss
 uricamic	I mean argmax, computed on features infected by loss
 wiking	ok i think this one is ready let's test it on the example :)

 wiking	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 n4nd0	wiking: ?
 wiking	screaming at my code :)
 wiking	why no work :)
 n4nd0	does it work?
 n4nd0	I mean when you scream :D
 wiking	heheh yeah
@sonney2k	wiking, please do your final evaluations today!
 wiking	hahah i looove when somebody is creating a release with -g flags
@sonney2k	?
 wiking	you always get some nice info:
 wiking	/home/eda/mosekprj/brn-6-0/extern/flexlm/src/11.10.0/osx64x86/libsb.a
@sonney2k	why would one not?
 wiking	sonney2k: in a release?
@sonney2k	ahh closed source ok...
 wiking	sonney2k: even if it's open source
@sonney2k	?
 wiking	i wouldn't create a release with -g
@sonney2k	then you have no info when things crash
@sonney2k	wiking, seen the 'please do the final eval today'?
 wiking	sonney2k: affirmitive
 wiking	sonney2k: *nod* and on it!
 wiking	sonney2k: i mean honestly i would just do a striped library for real release
 wiking	that way small memory footprint
 wiking	etc
 wiking	but it's good now as my code crashed big time
 wiking	ah null pointer referencing :)
 wiking	juhuuu
 wiking	n4nd0: still here?
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah
 n4nd0	uricamic: are you around?
 wiking	have u checked the static analyzer report for structure/*
 uricamic	n4nd0: yep
 n4nd0	wiking: not really to be honest
 wiking	n4nd0: http://maeth.com/shogun-report/report-LoMVrV.html#EndPath
 wiking	do u use DynProg atm somewhere?
 wiking	i mean it's jsut that it'd be great to clear out some of those problems
 n4nd0	uricamic: have you analyzed the Dual Lib QP BM SOSVM for memory leaks? I get some in my example when I am using it :S
@sonney2k	wiking, how do you create the static analysis btw?
 wiking	i'm happy to create a new report with the latest commit
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean we could run this on the bb's regularly...
 n4nd0	wiking: I am using PLiFs but those are defined in Plif.h and so not in DynProg
 wiking	sonney2k: yeah but we need clang/llvm for it
 wiking	sonney2k: at least for this particular one
 n4nd0	wiking: so no, I am not using anything from DynProg directly
 uricamic	n4nd0: to be honest not
 uricamic	I mean not using e.g. valgrind
 wiking	sonney2k: clang-analyzer.llvm.org
@sonney2k	wiking, that shouldn't be the problem I think
 uricamic	but according to some report system it should be ok
 n4nd0	uricamic: aham ok, I think there may be some leaks there - at least it is what valgrind tells me
 wiking	sonney2k: i'm happy to do it if u give me access where i can have clang
 uricamic	n4nd0: ok, can u send me the log then?
 n4nd0	uricamic: if you are busy with another thing I can try to fix it if you don't mind
 uricamic	n4nd0: ok, feel free to do that :)
 wiking	sonney2k: http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/installation.html
 n4nd0	uricamic: I will let you know about any change
 wiking	sonney2k: i'm not 100% sure that u really need to build the whole thing from scratch
 uricamic	n4nd0: ok
 uricamic	thx
 wiking	sonney2k: but yeah it'd be cool to have that report within the buildbot system
 wiking	hahahaha
 wiking	sonney2k: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=scan-build&mode=filename&suite=precise&arch=any
 wiking	sonney2k: easy peasy ;)
 wiking	sonney2k: apt-get install clang
 wiking	sonney2k: after that you just need scan-build ./configure && scan-build make
 wiking	and your report is ready
@sonney2k	wiking, will that do the usual compile too?
@sonney2k	I mean is the analysis in addition?
 wiking	sonney2k: good question
 wiking	sonney2k: it did compile me the libshogun
 n4nd0	wiking: have you used resize_vector in SGVector?
 n4nd0	wiking: valgrind detects leaks with it but I don't see anything weird in the code
 wiking	n4nd0: noup i haven't

 blackburn	worst day on job ever :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: why so?
 blackburn	support is on fire with 3-4 blocker issue
 blackburn	may be even 5
 n4nd0	what is that?
 blackburn	issue - well just like github issue
 blackburn	blocker means we have to respond immediately or close to that
 n4nd0	aaahm
 n4nd0	it was the blocker what confused me hehe
 n4nd0	but that means some job to do, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, so down to 0 blockers now?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw any ideas where gsomix is hiding?
 blackburn	n4nd0: blocker is like  OMG DAMN WE ARE GOING TO DIE issue
 blackburn	sonney2k: no I am still wroking on it
 n4nd0	blackburn: hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have a blocker issue here now
@sonney2k	blackburn, I at least know what you are talking about
 blackburn	sonney2k: hehe
 n4nd0	blackburn: valgrind complains quite a bit of SGVector::resize_vector, any clue about it?
 n4nd0	have you used this method before?
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, not really
 blackburn	let me get back to that a little bit later
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	I'll investigate a bit more then
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is like hey we sold you an alarm clock but it will stop incrementing seconds after 7 days of use
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :D I like your metaphors
 n4nd0	but last day's one with the party to go by car or boat and the bundle methods for SO is remains my favourite :D
 n4nd0	uricamic: let me ask you, why do you use resize_vector in libbmrm.cpp lines 528-530
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope you didn't have to use clearcase
 uricamic	n4nd0: it is there just because of the history tracks of Fp, Fd and wdists
 n4nd0	uricamic: it looks to me that at that point there is nothing else to do in the algorithm, then why to resize those vectors?
 blackburn	and we, wiking and I, are the only victims of it
 uricamic	and resize is there since I guess in the beginning there is initialization to the BufSize
 uricamic	so to remove the rest after nIter
 n4nd0	uricamic: aham, I understand
 uricamic	but probably this could be done in more clever way now
 uricamic	I was writing it in a hurry and also changed the way how these values are represented, so it is possible that the recent version is cumbersome
 n4nd0	uricamic: no problem :)
 uricamic	so the lines valgrind was complaining about were just these with resize_vector ?
 n4nd0	uricamic: yes, it seems something is not working as it should with resize_vector
 uricamic	n4nd0: I see, well positive is at least that the rest is ok :)
 n4nd0	uricamic: there was another thing related to using get_label in MulticlassModel::risk
 n4nd0	uricamic: but that was easy to solve
 uricamic	n4nd0: I see, ok
 n4nd0	uricamic: when you call get_label you need to do an UNREF later since this method increases the reference count of the object that returns
 n4nd0	uricamic: I will show you when I prepare the patch
 uricamic	n4nd0: aha, ok, thx
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw is your friend bern4rd still alive? I hope I can install the new website rather soon that is why I am asking (in case we run into issues...)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes he is alive, he's in an internship in Paris
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I can tell him about it
@sonney2k	Cool thanks
 n4nd0	what day will that be?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, well we put it live September eleven errr 1 :)
@sonney2k	if blackburn doesn't have blockers to fix :D
@sonney2k	but I want to put it live under some 'hidden' url fist
@sonney2k	first
 blackburn	next 3 days should be free
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	that's why I am finishing things with my burning head
@sonney2k	blackburner!
@sonney2k	bunsenblackburner even!
 blackburn	lol
 n4nd0	uricamic: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/756/files
 uricamic	n4nd0: THANKS
 n4nd0	that has solved the leaks I saw using so_multiclass.cpp
 n4nd0	it seems that there are some others triggered when using so_multiclass_BMRM.cpp
 uricamic	ok, I will have to update valgrind and look on that
 n4nd0	uricamic: I posted in my blog a good reference for valgrind if you need to check something
-!- yoo [575b08cb@gateway/web/freenode/ip.87.91.8.203] has joined #shogun
 yoo	hi all
 n4nd0	hi yoo
 uricamic	n4nd0: the only problem I encountered was that the last version I had haven't supported some instructions and therefore it actually didn't provide any useful information, the way how that could be overcome was to compile with some flag to disable those features
 n4nd0	uricamic: aham ok
 uricamic	but somebody told me, that there should be now new version for ubuntu, that should fix that issue
 uricamic	so I hope it will be ok, when I will update it
 n4nd0	uricamic: but that thing was for python support or for C++ programs too?
 uricamic	C++
 uricamic	it was something with 64bit and the intel i7, I think
 blackburn	fails on i5 as well
 uricamic	that valgrind was not able to get some instructuons and then it just refuse to examine the code
 blackburn	when I debug things I disable optimizations and it works

 uricamic	but the latest release of valgrind should hopefully fix that
 n4nd0	blackburn: CMakeLists, does shogun support cmake? didn't know about that!
 blackburn	yeah there was a effort of some guy before
 n4nd0	nice
 yoo	n4nd0: you cannot compile shogun using cmake because the lib dependencies are not up-to-date
 yoo	n4nd0: I have fill the CMakeLists.txt with new files just for visualization
 yoo	n4nd0: my IDE read cmake files, that's why ..
 n4nd0	yoo: aham, but we will be able to do so, compile with cmake, in the future?
 yoo	n4nd0: then we have to had all the dependencies in the root cmakelists.txt
 yoo	I can try to do this in the future but I am not very used to all shogun dependencies since I am still a shogun-noob

 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	interesting news
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: did you see my patch at github?
 blackburn	not yet
 blackburn	what is it about?
 n4nd0	the generic risk function, I fixed it a bit
 n4nd0	I get same results with it as with the one michal did in MulticlassModel
 n4nd0	what is good :)
 blackburn	what was wrong?
 n4nd0	initialization of subgrad and the computation of the risk
 blackburn	oooops
 n4nd0	the term -<w, psi(xi,yi)>
 blackburn	do we need to initialize subgrad?
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	did you change score in multiclass
 blackburn	I mean now you are adding loss
 blackburn	did you subtract it in multiclass?
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 blackburn	btw I think argmax in training mode should do that
 blackburn	it could be highly inefficient this way
 n4nd0	highly inefficient because I substract the delta?

 blackburn	what is deadline?
@sonney2k	tomorrow
 blackburn	n4nd0: inefficient because of <w,Phi(x,y_truth)>
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah sure, but it is the price of having it generic
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think the best idea is to do as wiking suggested
 blackburn	we could assume argmax does that
 n4nd0	blackburn: aham, we could do that too maybe
 blackburn	it sounds more efficient
