 sonney2k_	pickle27, hey - what are you doing?
 pickle27	sonney2k_: what up
 sonney2k_	pickle27, nothing shogun wise for me I hope only 6 more months till things normalize
 pickle27	sonney2k_: yeah I get around to some shogun web work once in a while but not often
 pickle27	hey did you get my mail about the irssi config?
 sonney2k_	pickle27, I saw the mail but didn't read it in detail
 sonney2k_	pickle27, what do you need?
 pickle27	was just wondering if you could send me the config so I can write up in detail how it works
 pickle27	I was also wondering how often the irc to html  cron runs
 sonney2k_	the irssi config is not what it is doing
 sonney2k_	it basically is just an ascii file
 sonney2k_	and some python script creating the logs on top
 pickle27	yeah I know
 sonney2k_	wish I had something updating things live or so
 sonney2k_	anyways
 sonney2k_	pickle27, so what is the state regarding the web site rewrite?
 pickle27	well I have most things done I have an email I was going to send out about the final steps and what we want
 pickle27	I wanted to include the irc logs in the new site or document how they work
 pickle27	I didn't really find a better way to do it than irssi and irc2html
 sonney2k_	pickle27, can I somehow give you access to the website and you look at this yourself?
 pickle27	I just wanted the config so I could have instructions for running irssi on a different machine
 pickle27	ummm I would need root I think
 sonney2k_	no
 sonney2k_	pickle27, can you log in to the webserver?
 pickle27	yeah wasnt expecting it
 pickle27	yeah I have ssh there
 pickle27	but I can
 pickle27	but I can
 pickle27	't see irssi files
 sonney2k_	afk, back in ~30mins
 pickle27	kk I'll have the command I need you to run ready

 sonney2k_	pickle27, ok just become the irssi user

-!- Netsplit over, joins: tcliou_, sonney2k_, @lisitsyn
 pickle27	sonney2k_: yeah becoming the irrsi user would work
 pickle27	I tried su irssi but there is still a pw on the user account
 pickle27	all I need is the contents of /home/irssi/.irssi/config
 pickle27	there may be a nickserv password in there
 pickle27	not sure if you want to remove it before sending to me
 pickle27	sonney2k_: back?
 sonney2k_	pickle27, sudo !
 sonney2k_	pickle27, yeah please try to be privacy aware with the stuff
 pickle27	hmm not sure I have a sudo password on that box
 sonney2k_	pickle27, well do it!
 pickle27	um sorry how?
 pickle27	I don't think I ever entered a password on this box
 pickle27	sonney2k_: okay thanks got what I need!
@lisitsyn	hey guys
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, the man from moscow!
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: apparently yes
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: are tanks already near?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, yeah obama just stationed them here
@lisitsyn	sounds good!
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: let me to your side then
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, you sure?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: da
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, well snowden is in cccp
 sonney2k_	for a reason...
 sonney2k_	anyways
 sonney2k_	anyone of you pushing a new release?
 sonney2k_	or any news shogun wise?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: I guess snowden is absolutely blind to not see the same thing here :D
@lisitsyn	uhmm I am not pushing it because I am pushed with my job :(
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, you mean he should rather get some us interrogation treat - njet :)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: well I'd better be monitored than be w/o internet at all :D
 pickle27	alright guys I am out!
 pickle27	I'll send something on the mailing list about the new website and planning soon!
 sonney2k_	pickle27, excellent!
 pickle27	have a good weekend guys!

 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, do you know of anyone pushing a release etc?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: heiko is the only capable yet I guess
@lisitsyn	he is like busy as well I gues
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, ok then I guess it won't happen soon
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: why?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, maybe when the 3 guys are at google
@lisitsyn	ahh this summit
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, the house has some stairs now
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: oh cool
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, so I might move in 3 months
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: will you have time once it is done?
 sonney2k_	no
 sonney2k_	constructions will continue until end of spring
@lisitsyn	sounds massive!
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, well deserted land around the house after the constructions right?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: are you like living on the construction site now or what?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, no
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, well we extend the house by basically attaching a new house (with connections) to the old one
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, so we just get the old one in shape and move into it once the new one has at least a roof and windows (but all interior work is missing)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: I see
-!- Laxus_25 [~Laxus_25@14.139.82.6] has joined #shogun
 Laxus_25	anybody online?
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, looks like!
 Laxus_25	okay
@lisitsyn	yeah even two of us
 Laxus_25	I am new here
 Laxus_25	I wanted to know about some current work going on
@lisitsyn	oh well we are like relaxing after gsoc :D
 Laxus_25	okay
 Laxus_25	:)
@lisitsyn	once gsoc is done # of commits get pretty low
@lisitsyn	so you said you want to do something related to machine learning?
 Laxus_25	yes I do
@lisitsyn	uhhm I see
@lisitsyn	you can actually browse through issues
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues
@lisitsyn	it depends what exactly you want to do
 Laxus_25	well I am more of a reseach kind of person
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, which topic?
 Laxus_25	currently I am working on 2 projects.
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, I mean basically the way things work here is you do what you like / are most interested in
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, so if you like to do ML algorithms of whatever kind - just do them
 Laxus_25	okay
 Laxus_25	I m currently working on classification in graph networks
 Laxus_25	Do them as in?...Is there anywhere I can start with pertaining to shogun toolkit?
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, pointers depend on what you want to do :)
 Laxus_25	I am interested more in implementing ML algorithms rather than the graphical and visualisation part
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, yes understood
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, does http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/developer_tutorial.html help?
 Laxus_25	okay i will start to get working with it
 Laxus_25	:)
 sonney2k_	Laxus_25, which algorithm do you want to implement?
 Laxus_25	I can start with Decision tree
 Laxus_25	I will start with getting myself familiarising with the toolkit and going through the developer doc
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, didn't someone do a decision tree this gsoc - I am not up-to-date...
 Laxus_25	I am just looking into it to get more familiar with the shogun-toolkit
 Laxus_25	After I get familiar, I will get into other implementations
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: this gsoc no but we have something about it
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, id3?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, I guess Heiko & wiking would know right?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k_: yeah wiking should know that I think

 Laxus_25	Sir the ID3 implementaion is not a very scalable implemetation to it
 Laxus_25	for scalability decision trees using SLIQ would be a better choice
