@lisitsyn	sonney2k: http://researchinprogress.tumblr.com/post/47777772527/free-drinks-during-poster-session
@lisitsyn	our famous ???????
-!- akshaydixi [~akshay@117.97.249.2] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, heh
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I just did the gsoc 2012 billing
@sonney2k	man I am slow...
@sonney2k	btw slow
@sonney2k	I wish we had https://www.ovh.de/server/dedicated/economy/l/
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what kind of billing?
@sonney2k	or bigger for shogun
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, for the mentor summit give chris and myself the money back we paid for the flight and car
@sonney2k	metro
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ha!
@lisitsyn	in april
@lisitsyn	of 2013?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: that's kind of 600 euros per year
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I meant it is been a while since the mentor summit
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: our website works pretty fast
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what is it you are unhappy with?
@sonney2k	well we got the google money in january
@lisitsyn	ahh I see
@sonney2k	so just 3 months delay caused by me
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, it is the 16GB memory
@sonney2k	we could very well use
@sonney2k	I think we might run into trouble with massive demoing / applications...
@sonney2k	but there is no rush
@sonney2k	we could do discuss things like that at the workshop
@sonney2k	which we still have to announce
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do we really need to have such dedicated server?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: may be some cloud thing would work too
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, too expensive
@sonney2k	the buildbots eat lots of mem / cpu
@lisitsyn	ahh yes
@lisitsyn	buildbots
@lisitsyn	ok sleep time
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: nite
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, sweet dreams!

@iglesiasg	good evening my friends
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, it is night!
@sonney2k	half open eyes mode
@iglesiasg	nah.. night is when you go to sleep :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, that is what I just wanted to do
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, finally you are op too
@sonney2k	took a while
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: oh really
@iglesiasg	awesome
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, if foulwall returns you can hive him the passphrase for the local sqlite db / django
@sonney2k	he should be able to do everything with that setup
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: I am not enterily sure how to this url router he mentioned, I was planning to check
@iglesiasg	for the moment I thought it should be something related with the urls.py file but I am not sure
@sonney2k	I guess he would want this to run on some live server
@sonney2k	but we don't have a spare for that
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, yes exactle
@sonney2k	he can just hook a method via urls.py
@sonney2k	and then render whatever he wants
@sonney2k	I have no idea how this should look like though
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: then there is no need for the passphrase for the local sqlite db / django I think
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, except if he wants to add some demos knob
@iglesiasg	but I will of course give it to him in case he needs it, I actually thought it whas that why he needed my help
@sonney2k	we have to come up with some ideas how we want it on the website though
@sonney2k	it is not so clear IMHO
@iglesiasg	indeed, not so clear for me either
@sonney2k	we could have all the demos in as figures in the bottom
@sonney2k	and when one clicks on a figure
@sonney2k	it will open up a live demo
@sonney2k	and show the source code for that stuff
@iglesiasg	something like d3.js demos you mean then?
@iglesiasg	e.g. http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063269
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, not exactly but similar yes
@sonney2k	we would only show shogun code for that
@iglesiasg	yes, it makes more sense
@iglesiasg	I like the idea
@sonney2k	we should discuss with lisitsyn & heiko too but usually they are fine with everything we do on the website :D
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	I have to get up in 5hrs
@sonney2k	so good night!
@iglesiasg	ok, have a good rest, good night sonney2k

 foulwall	hi anyone there?
@lisitsyn	foulwall: yes?
 foulwall	the app name in shogun-web is shogun which is the same as the "import shogun", and when I import the module in the web directory, it is masked ...
 foulwall	i can set a sys.path...that might fix the problem.
@lisitsyn	foulwall: but shogun modular is 'modshogun'
 foulwall	but when import the module, the usual way is "import shogun.Features", which will find ./shogun directory  first and if that exists it then find if there is a Features.py...
@lisitsyn	foulwall: it is just a shortcut for back compatibility
@lisitsyn	foulwall: you may import all the things from modshogun.*
 foulwall	so the better way is modshogun?
@lisitsyn	foulwall: not really better (the same) but it solves your problem
 foulwall	lisitsyn: thank you.
@lisitsyn	yw
 foulwall	lisitsyn: haha
@lisitsyn	foulwall: what?
 foulwall	lisitsyn: :-)
 foulwall	lisitsyn: but when execute "from modshogun.Features import *", and it reports "no module named Features" .
@lisitsyn	foulwall: from modshogun import *
@lisitsyn	it is flat
@lisitsyn	shogun.Features is just modshogun
@lisitsyn	as well as shogun.Kernel
@lisitsyn	or anything
 foulwall	lisitsyn: ok
 foulwall	lisitsyn: i'll have a futher look at the api of shogun.
@lisitsyn	foulwall: oh it is pretty simple - we just map all C++ classes with swig :)
 foulwall	lisitsyn: :-)

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, shogun.Features !
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: shogun.Features will work but there is a name clash he has met
