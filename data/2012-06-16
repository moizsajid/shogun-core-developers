@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh you are back from dead?
@sonney2k	nice :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	I start to realize that my paternal leave is more leave than being on holidays
 blackburn	heh
@sonney2k	I am basically only ever online in the evening
 blackburn	sonney2k: what do you do whole day?
@sonney2k	playing with the little one
 blackburn	whole day?!
 blackburn	whoa
@sonney2k	well he complains if not and then there is organize food, cook food, bring to kindertarden, fetch from kindergarten
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	so when he sleeps I have to prepare food & stuff
@sonney2k	anyway when I find time I need to get some chat app on the smartphone
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I read you had some defense?
@sonney2k	all good?
 blackburn	sonney2k: noo
 blackburn	defence on 21th
 blackburn	say pre-defence
 blackburn	but all good yes
@sonney2k	ohh but I guess you like to talk so it won't be a problem
 blackburn	haha why do you think so?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw regarding conferences - scipy conference would fit for shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, you chat all day when you are alive :D
 blackburn	is it ok to present shogun *again*?
@sonney2k	blackburn, why not - present the director features and other new cool stuff
 blackburn	anyway too late
@sonney2k	otherwise I dont' really know more software related conf's
@sonney2k	only core-ML ones
 blackburn	no problem I will present something else :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have funding to go to $CONF ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: my advisor said it is ok
 blackburn	can be done
@sonney2k	I mean you could certainly speak about your road sign recognition stuff at some workshop
 blackburn	everyone did that I think
 blackburn	(road sign recognition)
 blackburn	hey I just applied svm
@sonney2k	yeah but not with Coffin/dotfeatures
 blackburn	hehe
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw regarding shogun infrastructure
@sonney2k	our buildbot has more memory now
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	so the out of mem crashes should be fixed
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r30c471d / (4 files): Added task weighting - http://git.io/S3q8Lw

@sonney2k	question is - is the website fast enough now or should we move to some (rented) server that is 5 EUR more /month?
 blackburn	I have no troubles with site at all
@sonney2k	I would love to have some django based dynamically generated one...
@sonney2k	needs more horse power then
 blackburn	we can host at github actually
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	anyway I guess something we really need is a daily updated most-current documentation
@sonney2k	I will do that at some point in the near future :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, how?
 blackburn	sonney2k: they provide some stuff for that IIRC
 blackburn	you can have some fancy page of project
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean just one page or can one upload a few 100 MB?
@sonney2k	(doc is 270 MB currently)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	no idea about that
@sonney2k	and if we want to keep multiple versions of the documentation it will be a few GB
@sonney2k	arg
@sonney2k	make doc fails with latex hang
@sonney2k	l.704 $\Delta(y_{\text
@sonney2k	                      {true}}, y_{\text{pred}})$
@sonney2k	I guess that is some bug in n4nd0's code
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	looks legal :)
@sonney2k	no idea if we can tell doxygen that it should include the ams stuff
@sonney2k	it chokes up on \text
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	we can
 blackburn	iirc
@sonney2k	how?
 blackburn	let me try to recall
 blackburn	sonney2k: EXTRA_PACKAGES @ Doxyfile
-!- emrecelikten [~emre@176.40.254.205] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, seems to work
 blackburn	cool
@sonney2k	ohh it has a batchmode option too
@sonney2k	that certainly needs to be enabled
 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r740c2c5 / (doc/Doxyfile doc/Doxyfile_cn): include amsmath etc when building latex doxygen doc - http://git.io/luXrQQ
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you imagine what struggles it is to use russian fonts in latex?
@sonney2k	blackburn, how about the following - the default nightly default buildbot will create the doc once at night if it compiles?
 blackburn	I don't mind
 blackburn	should be better because we are asked sometimes
 blackburn	sth like 'wtf is wrong with your doc' :D
@sonney2k	I always though it is ovious that doc == doc of release version
@sonney2k	not unstable git stuff
@sonney2k	blackburn, are you Russian or am I?
 blackburn	but now we are rolling release software
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	no idea really
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	we will release after gsoc
 blackburn	yes
 shogun-buildbot_	build #628 of octave_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_modular/builds/628
@sonney2k	blackburn, I guess sleep is an option - dont' you agree?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes best option
@sonney2k	argmax certainly
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	yeah when you have nothing wrong in your s.t. part
 emrecelikten	:D
 blackburn	I should ask n4ndo to add an apllication that would do some decisions like that
@sonney2k	uhh I hear some kids creating noise signals
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I really think we need fancy applications
@sonney2k	so your road sign thing
@sonney2k	and some cool SO segemention stuff wiking has
 blackburn	heh their signal-noise rate will increase with years
@sonney2k	etc
 blackburn	yes I'll add RSR stuff
@sonney2k	so we can have some applications page or so with fancy images
@sonney2k	blackburn, please don't commit the data sets to shogun/src :D
@sonney2k	*SCNR*
 blackburn	:D :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: ~.5gb
 blackburn	well it was me only technically
@sonney2k	otherwise heiko will commit suicide and wiking will too when we attempt to get heiko back to live
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you only need the trained model right? so just the w - not too big :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: features?
@sonney2k	on demand computed from images
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean image is the input
 blackburn	well kinda demo version
 blackburn	hahaha I can train on test+train data when
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	then features are created f(x) - tada
 blackburn	see guys we have best RS recognition algo ever
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, well you can keep the training in there but with instructions where to get the data :D
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, then make sure you include all these https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=road+signs&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=V9XbT7u9MJSFhQf26PmPCg&ved=0CFYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1440&bih=781
 blackburn	http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/zombie_road_signs_11.jpg
 blackburn	this one especially
@sonney2k	yeah thats the most important one
@sonney2k	(we know from movies)
@sonney2k	maybe at day time it is save tough
 blackburn	heh\
@sonney2k	but you never know...
@sonney2k	anyway
@sonney2k	blackburn, nice zombie dreams

 n4nd0	hey people
 n4nd0	any of you with a working cplex license?
 n4nd0	Nico wants to me to check some errors related to cplex compilation in LPBoost...
 n4nd0	blackburn: btw, I am sorry about the eurocup :( it's been surprising
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	that team is just piece of
 n4nd0	I will be back later
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has left #shogun []
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think this can be done manually actually if you know the error
 blackburn	main thing why LPBOost etc fail is labels transition
 n4nd0	he sent me the trace but it contains some strange characters that make it difficult to read
 n4nd0	in addition, the issue is that this won't probably be the last error
 n4nd0	to fix this one will fire more and so on
 n4nd0	it would be nice to fix it once and for all
 n4nd0	I could also enter manually some USE_CPLEX in my .config to tell the truth
 blackburn	n4nd0: show me
 n4nd0	blackburn: I already answered Nico about that error he wrote in the mail
 n4nd0	blackburn: it is in LPBoost.cpp:149
 n4nd0	cannot go from CLabels* to CBinaryLabels*
 n4nd0	I think that is solved using CBinaryLabels::obtain_from_generic for the m_labels argument
 blackburn	n4nd0: no just cast
 n4nd0	blackburn: agree?
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	you may cast here I think
 n4nd0	(CBinaryLabels*)m_labels
 n4nd0	??
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	well, I think it is better to use the method
 n4nd0	since there is a sanity check
 n4nd0	in case the cast won't work
 n4nd0	and later the cast
 blackburn	both works
 n4nd0	probably
 n4nd0	I prefer the method in any case :)
 n4nd0	it feels safer IMHO
