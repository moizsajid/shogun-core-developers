@wiking	why ? :(

@wiking	haha
@wiking	streaming_onlineliblinear.cpp is bound to fail
@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
 lisitsyn	wiking: pong
@wiking	ok so for you
 lisitsyn	wiking: what's for me?
 lisitsyn	;)
@wiking	CStreamingAsciiFile would mean that it reads a CSV or a space delimited file
 lisitsyn	wiking: shouldn't it be streaming ascii file now?
 lisitsyn	errr
 lisitsyn	streaming csv file
@wiking	well it's currently named like this
@wiking	but the question is more about
@wiking	what it should be...?
@wiking	or add a new api?
 lisitsyn	wiking: are you ok with putting a Makefile that calls cmake
 lisitsyn	?
@wiking	to streamingascii->set_delimiter?
@wiking	so that way one can read both a comma and a space delimited file
 lisitsyn	wiking: does csv file support that?
@wiking	and let's say space would be the default (as till now)
@wiking	lisitsyn: csvfile yes

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Add set_delimiter option to StreamingAsciiFile
@wiking	this should fix the failing example..
@wiking	lisitsyn: makefile for cmake?
@wiking	lisitsyn: why?
 lisitsyn	wiking: well I have it locally
 lisitsyn	wiking: in my vim I just have a shortcut that calls make
@wiking	ok i get that but why do u need cmake involved?
@wiking	for the first time ?
 lisitsyn	so this makefile just cds to 'build' to and calls cmake from it
@wiking	but that's like 1 time
 lisitsyn	why?
@wiking	other times it should not be called
@wiking	since if there's a change in cmake files if you call make in build
@wiking	cmake will call itself
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	there's a target for that
@wiking	i mean cmake does this automagically
@wiking	it's just our own fault that sometimes we still need to trigger manually cmake
@wiking	that should be fixed

@wiking	yo
@wiking	sonney2k: do you know maybe why the right constructor is not being chosen?
@wiking	or how we might be able to enforce the right constructor?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add variable as first argument
@sonney2k	wiking, you crazy b!tch!
@sonney2k	wiking, you really want to fix it all don't you?
@wiking	sonney2k: well why not if possible
@wiking	sonney2k: as said r_modular would be a good thing for statistics people -> more users
@sonney2k	wiking, well I think it is doable now
@sonney2k	wiking, but I have no idea how to fix swig to choose the right constructor
@wiking	sonney2k: ok i'll look into that
@sonney2k	wiking, if you look at the generated R code(!)
@sonney2k	you will see that it creates some dispatcher function that is meant to call the right one
@sonney2k	but the dispatcher is wrong
@wiking	btw: ipython notebook server requires a python shell right?
@wiking	sonney2k: hehe ok. i guess then this is a fair amount of swig hack
@sonney2k	wiking, the next worrying thing about swig & R is that it is not very error tolerant
@sonney2k	wiking, e.g. if you do x$set_features(feats)
@sonney2k	you get infinite recursion
@wiking	sonney2k: well we do as much as we can...  and then of course still accept that swig generated R is not the 'best thing' atm
@sonney2k	this is because you need to specify x as first argument again (wtf?!)
@sonney2k	x$set_features(x, feats)
@sonney2k	no idea why that is necessary but with the x it should work
@wiking	mmm yeah i'll give it a go
@wiking	btw: sonney2k http://thomassileo.com/blog/2012/11/19/setup-a-remote-ipython-notebook-server-with-numpyscipymaltplotlibpandas-in-a-virtualenv-on-ubuntu-server/
@wiking	we could test this
@wiking	on fatbot
@wiking	as u said in a chroot
@wiking	and then we'll see ourselves first
@wiking	and then consider it to open to the public or not
@sonney2k	wiking, yeah but ...
@sonney2k	it is  nightmare security wise
@sonney2k	no way to secure
@wiking	but yeah i'm already planning a restructuring of the buildbot master
@wiking	mmm yeah i know
@sonney2k	I think the only sane way would be some virtual box image that is scratched whenever someone loggs off
@wiking	i mean giving a full python shell out to the public is crazy
@wiking	sonney2k: ah well that's doable
@wiking	virtualenv
@sonney2k	wiking, but then fatbot is not fat enough
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm we'll see, no? :)
@wiking	sonney2k: if we really start to struggle with resources
@wiking	we'll put there the paypal sponsor button :P

@sonney2k	wiking, currently it is building fc19,fcrh,debstatic, debmodular,precise all at the same time
@wiking	sonney2k: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah that's why i said that i'll redo the master.cfg
@wiking	sonney2k: into a sane distributed build
@wiking	so some of them go nightly or every 6 hours
@wiking	and some of them go with various dependencies
@wiking	hence to remove too many parallel build
@wiking	sonney2k: so we just put everything in that virtualenv
@wiking	and have fun within that
@wiking	this is kind of like what travis does
@wiking	a precreated virtualenv
@wiking	and for each job it's 'inited' from scratch

@wiking	sonney2k: ok so now priority is to have all the static and r_modular interfaces runnning
@wiking	and then i'll do the refactoring of the master.cfg of the buildbot
@sonney2k	wiking, yep
@sonney2k	wiking, I think static is working already you just need to do the cmake/ buildbot support
@sonney2k	wiking, if R is what I expect then it would be trivial to fix for me
@wiking	i'm just rebuilding the R modular
@wiking	to check the R file
@sonney2k	wiking, btw did you use r_install.sh ?
@sonney2k	wiking, I did this weird Rdata compression in there
@sonney2k	otherwise just loading modshogun would have taken a minute
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i use that script
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i know... i did that RData generation
@wiking	to speed up the process
@sonney2k	ok good
@sonney2k	wiking, I think we should retire slave4
