 blackburn	wiking: pluskid: uricamic: n4nd0: one puzzle for you - will results change if we use fourier transformed features in SVM?
 wiking	:)
 pluskid	don't know
 uricamic	what results? :)
 blackburn	any
 blackburn	so the answer is no - parceval theorem
 blackburn	dot product in original space and dot product in fourier space are equal
 blackburn	I've been so stupid I forgot about it and tried to classify in fourier domain
 pluskid	interesting
 blackburn	IIRC some other integral tranforms meet parceval too
 n4nd0	blackburn: I didn't know that it also preserves the result of the dot product, good to learn new stuff :)

 n4nd0	nicococo: hey!
 n4nd0	how is it going?
 nicococo	hi n4nd0.. its hot and i don't want to work anymore... :)
 nicococo	i wrote you an email a couple of minutes ago..
 wiking	oh
 wiking	it's weekly update day
 n4nd0	nicococo: yeah, thanks, you made me woke up finally :)
 n4nd0	the cell told me about your mail
 n4nd0	so as I told you in the mail I did a couple of modifications and the results of multiclass classification improved a bit
 nicococo	did you party all night?
 n4nd0	they're *more or less* comparable to one-vs-rest
 n4nd0	nicococo: not really, I just feel like taking a nap sometimes :P
 nicococo	*more or less* seems reasonable enough to me
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	but I would like to do one more test about this to feel confident
 n4nd0	since the results for this example change a lot with one-vs-rest using bias or not
 n4nd0	I want to try training the so-svm with bias
 blackburn	wiking: yes, is there anything to report? ;)
 wiking	yeps
 nicococo	okay, there is enough time to do more tests.. especially if we want to test the coffin thingy with the mc-example
 n4nd0	nicococo: so do you have to say something in special about doing it with bias?
 n4nd0	nicococo: I thought of it and I think that it would be basically to add one more element to w
 n4nd0	nicococo: and pad all the joint feature vectors psi with a 1 at the end
 nicococo	you add a one dimension for all phi_i(xi)
 n4nd0	not psi?
 nicococo	if you have 4 classes the joint feature vector is growing 4 dimensions, right?
 n4nd0	the joint feature vector would be 4*dimension of each feature vector
 n4nd0	ok, I think I see what you mean
 n4nd0	I was thinking that it would be something that doesn't depend on the application at hand when it does depend
 n4nd0	so the weight vector w is going to #classes more elements with a biased hyperplane
 nicococo	yes
 nicococo	so basically, there is a problem when using bias terms, if i understand correctly?
 n4nd0	what problem?
 nicococo	classification performance problems?
 n4nd0	without bias the results tend not to be very good when the number of examples and number of classes grow
 n4nd0	but I think that's logical
 nicococo	sure
 nicococo	then lets try the same with coffin, okay..
 n4nd0	about coffin, I read the paper again
 n4nd0	but I have not thought how to introduce it to the framework
 n4nd0	I have been busy with the debugging
 nicococo	well, it is already implemented in shogun (afaik) and we just have to
 n4nd0	I don't know if you have taken a look to what I changed in the code
 nicococo	..replace  vector multiplications
 nicococo	which file?
 n4nd0	PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp
 nicococo	i think you just have to replace compute_loss_arg in order to use coffin
 n4nd0	and probably in MulticlassModel, where the joint feature vector is computed
 n4nd0	since there it is done explicitily
 nicococo	the method compute_loss_arg should be moved into the model anyway..
 n4nd0	I could do that
 n4nd0	but the thing about coffin requires more work than that I think
 wiking	blackburn: what happened with you :)
 n4nd0	do you have clear what needs to be done?
 blackburn	wiking: what do you mea?
 wiking	blackburn: what happened with the soccer team of russia?!
 blackburn	wiking: they are stupid bastards :D
 nicococo	n4nd0: probably.. there must be some setup/init routine but i don't have a clue but i have soerens telefon number and can make use of it ;)
 n4nd0	nicococo: it could be cool if you can do that
 nicococo	i try and will tell you tomorrow.
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	wiking: our captain prefer selling Lay's but not to train I think :)

 wiking	well i really thought they were good

 blackburn	well if we won we would have to beat germany
 wiking	:D
 blackburn	no way
 wiking	yeah i was already looking forward
 wiking	for seeing you and sonney2k here while russia and germany is playing soccer :)
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	I think sonney2k doesn't care at all
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	I wish portugal to win
 wiking	heheheh
 wiking	today croatia vs spain :)
 wiking	i wonder who'll win that one
 wiking	brb
 wiking	gotta grab a coffee
 blackburn	wonder??
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	spain is pretty hmm strong
 wiking	 but i'm for croatia :)

 blackburn	puffin444: hey
 blackburn	are you using anything from NLOPT?
 puffin444	blackburn, hey
 puffin444	I hope to use the mma algorithm
 blackburn	I think it is worth to add a nlopt wrapper here
 puffin444	One problem is that a lot of the local gradient opt algorithms are fortran translated into c
 puffin444	A nlopt wrapper?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	why do you care about its code?
 puffin444	So we just interface with the code?
 blackburn	yes
 puffin444	Oh I was scared I would have to re-implement the whole algorithm and use nlopt as a benchmark for accuracy
 blackburn	should be better I believe?
 blackburn	why?
 CIA-18	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r4ce3514 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Added CSignal handling to MulticlassLibLinear - http://git.io/QAMiiw
 blackburn	I am currently adding it to configure so soon we will be able to use it inside
 puffin444	I wasn't sure if actually just including nlopt with a wrapper was something the shogun community wanted
 blackburn	hmm we should remove any reason to think so :)
 puffin444	but just interfacing should make things vastly easier.
 blackburn	I didn't even know there is a problem with that
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	we integrated some code like liblinear not because we want to have one million LoC
 blackburn	but because it wasn't applicable
 puffin444	ok
 blackburn	puffin444: okay in your further code just guard your code with ifdef HAVE_NLOPT
 blackburn	I will commit soon
 blackburn	configure with nlopt detection
 puffin444	blackburn, will do.
 blackburn	puffin444: here you go feel free to use it ;)

 KMcQuisten	Hey there folks
 KMcQuisten	So when the headers for the normalizers were moved, it broke some references in some SVMs and some kernels that had built-in normalizers.  I've branched off of the master and fixed them.  How should I go about putting in a request to have them pulled
 KMcQuisten	?
@sonney2k	blackburn, can we have the normalizers in kernels/normalizers please?
 blackburn	sonney2k: normalizers?
 blackburn	we have kernel not kernels
 blackburn	so normalize
 blackburn	not normalizer
@sonney2k	normalizer then
 blackburn	that's the logic
 blackburn	normalizer is ok
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: just push to your github and press pull request button
 KMcQuisten	Ok, the changes I ahve still have all the headers in the /normalize folder.  Do you want me to change it to /normalizer before I push?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: no let me do it after
 KMcQuisten	Allright
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw good to see you being active again
@sonney2k	btw what is nlopt?
 blackburn	sonney2k: nonlinear optimization library
 blackburn	it has funny method named COBYLA :D
 blackburn	no idea whether your russian will remind you something
 blackburn	if not - it stands for female horse
 blackburn	sonney2k: both puffin444 and pluskid need it
 blackburn	sonney2k: and unfortunately I'll become less active again for ~ two days
 blackburn	or even dead as you said :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, no idea about the quality of the package ... no release for > 1 year
 blackburn	sonney2k: oliver recommended it at some point if I understood that correctly
 blackburn	there are only a few gpl optimization libraries so not bad to have dependency on it
 blackburn	hmm ceres!
 KMcQuisten	blackburn:  I'm going to need a little guidance through this.
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: sure
 KMcQuisten	Should I merge my branch before I try to push?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: push to?
 KMcQuisten	blackburn:  I'm not sure exactly.  I branched off of the master and made some fixes.  What's the process for getting those changes back to the repository?
 blackburn	so you have the fork on github right?
 KMcQuisten	I don't believe so, or at most I do not know.  I've kept everything local so far.
 blackburn	aham so you did git clone
 blackburn	right?
 KMcQuisten	yes
 blackburn	did you commit your changes?
 KMcQuisten	to my local branch off master, yes
 blackburn	so what you may do now is
 blackburn	format patch and send to me
 blackburn	or fork, do these changes in your fork and do a pull request
 KMcQuisten	Ok, so i've made my fork on github.  Pull from there, then make the changes and push, then do a pull request?
 blackburn	yes
 KMcQuisten	Sounds like a plan, thanks.
 blackburn	latter way is preferrable good you choose it :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw is puffin444's patch merged?
 blackburn	not
@sonney2k	blackburn, will n4nd0 be here this evening?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	wish we could merge hsi
@sonney2k	blackburn, any news about gsomix? did the tornado do more harm there?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no more harm, but he prepares for his exams I think
@sonney2k	hmmhh then I hope he sends some status update
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I just reached him via jabber
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw yesterday I empirically proved parceval theorem with director kernel
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	however stupidity is not good anyway
 puffin444	tornadoes!!
 puffin444	Are there tornadoes in Russia?
 blackburn	some kind of
 blackburn	but not like tornado rather hurricane I think
@sonney2k	blackburn, what's the difference?
 blackburn	sonney2k: between?
@sonney2k	blackburn, tornado and hurricane
 blackburn	no things like http://kataklizmic.narod.ru/tor1.jpg
 blackburn	but very strong weather?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I saw that you changed sparse vectors / matri
@sonney2k	x
 blackburn	sonney2k: only matrix
@sonney2k	is it working now with references?
@sonney2k	ok
 puffin444	looks like a tornado to me
@sonney2k	and what is a hurriance then
@sonney2k	hurricane?
 blackburn	argh
 puffin444	A really mean tropical storm
 blackburn	I wrote weather? :D
 blackburn	I meant wind
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd say hurricane is strong rain and strong wind
 blackburn	but tornado is tornado and we have it very rarely
 blackburn	in usa they emerge way more often
@sonney2k	so tornado is 'just' wind?
 blackburn	tornado is http://kataklizmic.narod.ru/tor1.jpg
 puffin444	A tornado is sort of like an intense air whirpool
 blackburn	yeahhh!
 blackburn	whirpool!
 blackburn	I've been waiting for this word
 puffin444	They pop all the time in Illinois, but somehow I've never seen one in person.
 blackburn	puffin444: are you from IL originally?
 puffin444	Yes on the very edge of the Chicago area
@sonney2k	I think I've seen some small ones in australia/namibia then
@sonney2k	walked even through them
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you been to namibia?
@sonney2k	yah
 puffin444	I think those are dust devils, little mini tornados. A full tornado pulls chunks of houses into the sky sometimes.
@sonney2k	dust devils - yeah nice word
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need an application in shogun/applications called like that
 blackburn	dust devil?
 blackburn	what should it do? break houses?
 KMcQuisten	I live in Iowa, and we usually have a handfull of towns either damaged or destroeyed every spring and summer.
@sonney2k	some windy thing
 KMcQuisten	by tornadoes.  Dust devils are pretty harmless
 blackburn	eeeyeee lives in iowaaa
 KMcQuisten	Had one go by me about 200m from my car once
 blackburn	no 12 oz mouse fans here :(
 KMcQuisten	Ha!  Not so much.  I watch a bunch of other adult swim shows though
 KMcQuisten	A few years back a town on a river got leveled by a tornado, and then the next week the river flooded and washed the debris away.  The whole town jsut vanished
 KMcQuisten	Ok, when I'm trying to push my changes to my fork, i'm getting a 403 error
 blackburn	hmm?
 blackburn	so you do 'git pull origin?'
 KMcQuisten	yes
 blackburn	ah I know
 KMcQuisten	ok
 blackburn	a min
 blackburn	git remote update origin git://github.com/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/shogun
 KMcQuisten	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually I thought about normalizer name and normalize made more sense for me
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: did that help?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ping
 blackburn	I want to check if PyObject is SGObject
 blackburn	can it be done?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, from C++?
@sonney2k	some instanceof thing
 blackburn	sonney2k: I want to add [] -> CList typemap
 blackburn	do you mind?
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw why do you use CList and not any of the DynamicObjectArrays etc
 blackburn	I do not need indexing here :)
 blackburn	and I do not like dynamic object arrays yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, hah I don't like lists :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you remember how to get underlying instance of PyObject?
 blackburn	I can't find the definition of PyObject :(
 blackburn	found

 blackburn	nice
 KMcQuisten	:)
 KMcQuisten	Glad I could finally contribute directly
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	you are very welcome for further contributions
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: it is actually very cool you are using shogun for some string stuff
 blackburn	nobody from current dev team does any strings related thing..
 KMcQuisten	Yes indeed.  Now that kernels are working I can actually try a few ideas I've had bouncing around in my head for the last couple years
 KMcQuisten	directorkernels
 KMcQuisten	I see.  Well i'm glad that I can at least keep banging on that part of the code to see what might break :)
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: did you manage to use some kind of external features btw?
 KMcQuisten	gsomix made the get_lhs and get_rhs returns polymorphic, so I don't have to bring in external features anymore.  Before I'd just been precomputing kernel matrices.
 blackburn	I see
