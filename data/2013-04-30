@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I'll arrive to schoenefeld :D
 sonne|work	haha
 sonne|work	that is not an airport
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: nice :D
 sonne|work	it is some temporary construction site
@lisitsyn	hmm
@lisitsyn	let me check
 sonne|work	you will have to walk off the plane
 sonne|work	for 500m's
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: that's usual here in samara :D
 sonne|work	then pass through some boxes and then walk again 200m's to get to a train station
 sonne|work	but hey
@lisitsyn	haha nice nice
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I checked - it is schoenefeld
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: any ideas what we do about the failed test on travis? We now have the full detail...
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: output is here https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/6739254
 sonne|work	(go to the very end)
 sonne|work	you will notice that the originally serialized object deviates by 1e-17 or even 1e-18
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: interesting
 sonne|work	I would totally understand that if other tests were failing too
 sonne|work	but it seems to be just this one !?!
 sonne|work	and only w/ one setting
@lisitsyn	we get lucky
@lisitsyn	that's the only thing I can say haha
 sonne|work	well but what do we do about it
 sonne|work	we could
 sonne|work	a) just drop the first setting
 sonne|work	or change the test to return some numpy values
 sonne|work	or ...?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn, wiking any ideas?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: it sounds unreasonable to test values with such precision
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yes and no
 sonne|work	what this test does is serialize a file
 sonne|work	err object
 sonne|work	and then it does the same thing again
 sonne|work	and compares
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: it may be just gmnpsvm tihng
 sonne|work	so stuff should match 100%
 sonne|work	I don't see how
 sonne|work	gmnpsvm tests don't have this issue
@lisitsyn	don't we train it in this example?
@lisitsyn	we should not train it there
 thoralf	sonne|work: Sorry if I'm bugging - but did you think about my email?  i.e. how to use stream_features->get_vector() properly?
* sonne|work overload
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: yes we train
 sonne|work	it is meant to be a complex example
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: we have a) multiclass machine - so it has multiple SVMs
 sonne|work	each having its kernel set & features
 sonne|work	and labels
 sonne|work	and preprocessors attached
 sonne|work	and if you currently train GMNPsvm on that example
 sonne|work	then serialize to .json etc etc
 sonne|work	and then load from json etc
 sonne|work	and train again
 sonne|work	you will get exactly the same result (except for json - slightly worse accuracy)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: well I mean we could just initialize it rather hard-coded
@lisitsyn	and then we will not have that issues
@lisitsyn	issue*
@lisitsyn	it makes sense to test only serialization here
@lisitsyn	but not gmnpsvm
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: makes sense. Then I would just say we remove the first test and simplify it later
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: by may 6th we have to request the number of slots
 sonne|work	so we should have students <-> mentors loosely assigned by then
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: alright

@lisitsyn	sonne|work: do you think I'll get to tiergarten from schoenefeld somewhat at 22:00?
@lisitsyn	by public transport? or rather taxi?
 sonne|work	why go to tiergarten?
 sonne|work	that is the other airport
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: hotel is there
 sonne|work	more or less
 sonne|work	I still don't get why you dont' take the ostel
 sonne|work	but yes sure
@lisitsyn	yes I know tegel is closer but my tickets are to schoenefeld
@lisitsyn	ostel is not cheapier than what I chose
@lisitsyn	may be just a little
@lisitsyn	so why not to live in something more comfortable? :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: not really tiergarten - cross of schillstrasse and kurfuerstenstrasse
 sonne|work	your holidays :)
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I just don't know how good public transport is - that's why I am asking
@lisitsyn	in samara it could be a trouble to get to the city that late :D
@lisitsyn	but we are wild you know
@lisitsyn	I was surprised you have night transport
 sonne|work	well it is berlin
@lisitsyn	we have nothing like buses on roads after midnight
@iglesiasg	no roads haha
 sonne|work	20% of the people wake up around midnight here
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: according to the pictures you have shown, you roads also have some troubles during daylight
@iglesiasg	:P
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: oh that keeps you awake
@lisitsyn	you can't be no cautious here
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: iglesiasg: btw happy bday to gsomix
@iglesiasg	cool
 van51	sonne|work: hey, did you see the messages I left you? can it be that it still leaks?
 van51	also if not, should i start another entry issue?

 sonne|work	van51: looks like my messages got dropped
@iglesiasg	abinash: I can glance over it but I am just a simply mortal student :P
 sonne|work	van51: yes - it might still leak memory
 sonne|work	I was only ensuring that it gives the correct result / doesn't crash
@iglesiasg	abinash: I mean for you to know that I am not a mentor or so
 abinash	iglesiasg: ok
@iglesiasg	abinash: link me to it please
 abinash	iglesiasg: just a moment I am sending you the link

@iglesiasg	gsomix: feliz cumplea?os!
 gsomix	iglesiasg: thanks. :)
 van51	sonne|work: ok.. those wrong results/crashes did you see them from travis or from "make tests"?
 abinash	iglesiasg: here is the link http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/abinashpanda/1
 van51	so I can try to spot them on my own from now on
@iglesiasg	abinash: I think it looks good ;)
 abinash	iglesiasg: ok, are there any changes to be made particularly in the project details and in the timeline
 gsomix	iglesiasg: friends gave me a bottle of Spanish non-alcoholic wine today. not vodka, but ok.
@iglesiasg	abinash: from top level it looks fine I think. The thing is that I am not completely aware of the contents of this project, maybe Vojtech can give you better feedback
@iglesiasg	gsomix: is it called mosto?
 sonne|work	van51: I just ran the serialize complex example from python
@iglesiasg	abinash: I think there is a type in the timeline btw
@iglesiasg	abinash: july 15 - august 29 should be july 29 I think
@iglesiasg	type -> typo*
 abinash	iglesiasg: yeah just noticed it, thanks
@iglesiasg	abinash: in any case, from my experience I think that it is normally more important to make contributions rather than writing a fancy application
 abinash	iglesiasg: ok, I have contributed to one issue previously and now working on another one
@iglesiasg	abinash: at first sight, I think that the part of interfacing libqp from modular interfaces should be easy to do
@iglesiasg	maybe it could be an idea to get that part done and include it in the application
@iglesiasg	abinash: only my opinion :)
 gsomix	iglesias: yes, I think so. but I don't know technology of production exactly. http://bit.ly/189Go0r
 abinash	iglesiasg: ok, then I should write atleast the python interfaces and the rest of modular interfaces can be left as a part of GSoC project
@iglesiasg	gsomix: ahhh ok, I think it is not mosto though

@wiking	sonne|work: ping
 sonne|work	wiking: poiiing
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so question: i couldn't find any specific macros/variables for freebsd in ./configure
 sonne|work	wiking: so?
@wiking	which one(s) were u referring to yesterday?
 sonne|work	just add them
@wiking	sonne|work: heheh ok cool that's even more work...
 sonne|work	there is a function called freebsd()
 sonne|work	not really
 van51	sonne|work: hey again :P so with your changes and mine, I don't see neither that test failing nor any memory leaks
 van51	would you like me to make another PR so you can have another look?
 sonne|work	van51: is it still the same one you do?

@wiking	sonne|work: what if i add this into test_modular ?
@wiking	as it's swig related
 sonne|work	wiking: check_wordsize maybe
 sonne|work	it is a workaround for wrong wordsize so I think it fits best there
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah although that script runs fine as it uses simple c
@wiking	not c++
 sonne|work	just add the if freebsd ; then ...
 sonne|work	what?
 sonne|work	DEFINES_SWIG="${DEFINES_SWIG} -DSWIGWORDSIZE64"
 sonne|work	after this line
 sonne|work	just add this
 sonne|work	if
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah as i said yesterday wordsize is 64 if u compile with c and not c++
 sonne|work	sorry what?
 sonne|work	just do the fix there and be done
 van51	sonne|work: yeap the same one
@wiking	sonne|work: shall it be part of DEFINES_SWIG ?
 sonne|work	yes it is only affecting swig
@wiking	ok lets see
@wiking	we still need --swig as well
 sonne|work	van51: I think the reference count increase there is justified - what is missing is to decrement the counter once the structure is no longer used
@wiking	since the swig binary is swig2.0 and not swig
 sonne|work	van51: so you found the issue but I would solve it differently
 sonne|work	wiking: not really difficult isn't it?
 sonne|work	just do it
@wiking	yeah and as well as -ldl removal

@wiking	i think thi one has been cropped
@wiking	sonne|work: http://pastebin.com/RZ8s1HQ4
@wiking	it's better here
@wiking	so basically that variable is passed for swig
@wiking	which we don't really need
@wiking	but we need it for clang++
@wiking	hence it should be appeneded to COMP_...
 sonne|work	ok
@wiking	COMPFLAGS_CPP
@wiking	testing
@wiking	btw
@wiking	this is not the best:

@wiking	it's using gcc.... but it should use clang
@wiking	as that the compiler based on ./configure
@wiking	sssshsss
@wiking	woah
@wiking	why that clang++ does not use COMPFLAGS_CPP
@wiking	COMPFLAGS_CPP += $(DEFINES)
@wiking	COMPFLAGS_C += $(DEFINES)
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	where DEFINES += $(DEFINES_PYTHON_MODULAR)
 sonne|work	wiking: that is for dependency generation - ignore that
@wiking	still
@wiking	i have to somehow pass those 2 defines
@wiking	so i'll try now DEFINES=....

@wiking	let's see the integration tests
@wiking	yep
@wiking	the same integration tests fails on freebsd as on osx

@wiking	and yeah cool
@wiking	everything went fine
@wiking	although it did not run the integration tests
@wiking	which is cool
@wiking	as it would have failed
@sonney2k	wiking, any thoughts how we can mirror the github repository to shogun-toolbox.org & code.google.com?
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm why do u want to mirror?
@sonney2k	wiking, everything
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean for shogun-toolbox.org should be easy as i guess u have a shell for it :P
@wiking	sonney2k: so just a simple cron script for mirroring
@sonney2k	I dont' know if it is good - but this year we will have likely 20-30 student proposals only
@wiking	only? :)
@sonney2k	I think we are raising the bar to enter year by year getting fewer submissions
@wiking	last year we had more?
@sonney2k	wiking, yes - 2 years ago we had >70
@wiking	ah and last year?
@sonney2k	last year we hard ~45
@sonney2k	had
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	does the quality keeps at least the same?
@sonney2k	but again quality of proposals improved year by year
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	well
@wiking	how many slots did u apply for last year?
@wiking	i mean this year
@wiking	?
@sonney2k	it is good for us (not so many reviews) but not clear if this will reduce #slots
@sonney2k	not sure yet
@wiking	ah slots are not decided yet?
@sonney2k	I think about 10
@sonney2k	but that woudl be really a lot
@sonney2k	if we get them
@sonney2k	wiking, btw here is the graph from 2012 http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012
@sonney2k	(scroll down a bit)
@wiking	yeah i remember :P
@wiking	the last minute proposals
@wiking	well we have 3 more days ;)
@sonney2k	we got 12 applications by now
@sonney2k	maybe 7 HQ
@sonney2k	definite want
@wiking	but hey last year we had like 9 no?
@wiking	i mean i think that 7 will get the slots :)
@wiking	apache gets like crazy amount of slots
@wiking	afaik they apply as apache foundation in gsoc
@wiking	but there's like mahout, lucene, hadoop etc.
@wiking	and that's like at least 5 slots apache subproject
