 Hieronymous	Is there any way that I can use SHOGUN's HMM ? It is lacking documentation. Any hints on how I can proceed ?

 Hieronymous	sonne|work: Sure, I will ask them then. Thanks.
 Hieronymous	Saurabh7, wiking: Any docs/pointers on writing tests for SHOGUN and then testing it. GitHub wiki is empty.
