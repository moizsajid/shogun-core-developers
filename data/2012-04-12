 harshit_	n4nd0: Hola !
 n4nd0	harshit_: ey! how is it going?
 harshit_	hey, my TSVM is almost ready but the problem is it takes too much time to converge
 harshit_	whereas in svmlin time it doesn't takes that much time
 harshit_	dont knw whats going on!!
 n4nd0	harshit_: aham, so there must something different between both implementations right=?
 n4nd0	mmmm about time of convergence, have you checked if they use a kind of tolerance value
 harshit_	yeah, but I havnt changed that part much in shogun. that was already in shogun
 harshit_	tolerance value ??
 n4nd0	yeah, it was just an idea ...
 harshit_	how to check that..?
 n4nd0	looking at their code
 n4nd0	anyhow, are you confident then that it is not caused by the code you have written but by the other code?
 harshit_	might be .! dont know exactly at this time .. have to debug a lil more
 harshit_	n4nd0: Hows your covertree
 n4nd0	harshit_: I have to discuss with blackburn some details before starting to do the port
 n4nd0	but it looks promising, it is very fast
 harshit_	great .. Maybe after completing on KNN we can apply it on K-Means ,
 harshit_	what sya

 gsomix	hi all
@sonney2k	we are currently investigating if we can handle all 9 or just 8 (as we requested)
@sonney2k	s/just/'just'/
@sonney2k	it is a huuuge number
 gsomix	and good morning
 n4nd0	gsomix: good morning
 n4nd0	sonney2k: really, could it be a problem with the number of mentors?
 gsomix	9?
 n4nd0	gsomix: yeah
 gsomix	time to vodka
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	c'mon isn't it like 10 around there? :P
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	that's not good
@sonney2k	not enough mentors
@sonney2k	we had more ideas but for some ideas we did not get good proposals
@sonney2k	so these mentors won't mentor anything
@sonney2k	so in fact we are 7-8 mentors
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	have to leave train
 n4nd0	tty later

 gsomix	*is going
 sonne|work	n4nd0: which timezone are you in?
 sonne|work	gsomix: which timezone are you in?
 sonne|work	blackburn: timezone?
 sonne|work	I need to collect to know when you all are online...
 blackburn	sonne|work: both me and gsomix are in +4
 n4nd0	sonne|work: CEST (UTC+2)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think we are in the same
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes indeed
 sonne|work	does anyone know which timezone pluskid is in?
 blackburn	+8
 sonne|work	and heiko?
 blackburn	I guess +1?
 n4nd0	btw, if someone had any doubt, apart from being pretty fast, JL's cover tree gives correct results :)
 sonne|work	heh
 sonne|work	nice
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so then it is even more clear that we want it :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I'm working on that ;)
 sonne|work	blackburn: wiking?
 sonne|work	and jacob?
 blackburn	sonne|work: belgium, same?
 blackburn	no idea about jacob
 sonne|work	harshit? and philippe?
 blackburn	harshit +5 or +6
 n4nd0	sonne|work: philippe is in France so I guess he has the same
 blackburn	philippe france

 wiking	yes
 sonne|work	kthx
 blackburn	seems you guys are having shortest word competition
 wiking	:>
 sonne|work	I've updated the website http://shogun-toolbox.org/
 sonne|work	not sure if a github banner is a good idea but hey I added it for now
 sonne|work	also removed broken links to tuebingen mpg
 blackburn	yes it is
 n4nd0	nice
 sonne|work	ahh but I got the link wrong
 blackburn	sonne|work: we need new description I think
 sonne|work	hah
 sonne|work	after gsoc :)
 sonne|work	and volunteers welcome!
 n4nd0	what description are you talking about guys?

 sonne|work	no overlap in this set I guess then
 sonne|work	not good
 blackburn	sonne|work: may be some saturday evening would work
 blackburn	however it is saturday heh
 pluskid	cool to hear good news about 9 slots!
 sonne|work	pluskid: you were UTC+8 right?
 pluskid	GMT+8, is it the same as UTC+8?
 pluskid	I'll google it
 blackburn	yes
 pluskid	sonne|work: yes, UTC+8
 pluskid	the homepage github link point to http://github.com/you , is it intended?
 blackburn	lol
 pluskid	and the "you" actually has 16 followers
 pluskid	though no public repo
 pluskid	Previously I thought one mentor can be on multiple project, am I wrong?
 blackburn	you mean one person?
 pluskid	yes
 blackburn	yes that can be
 pluskid	one person (as a mentor) can be in several projects(ideas), isn't it?
 pluskid	I'm not sure
 sonne|work	pluskid: yes
 sonne|work	but we try to restrict things
 sonne|work	to be 1vs1
 pluskid	oh, that might be good for better quality
 sonne|work	which means 7-8 slots is what we will actually use
 sonne|work	(the downside of things)
 pluskid	:-/
 wiking	blackburn: hey man i'm testing the multi class linear machine... and i'm not soooo satisfied with the speed :D
 blackburn	wiking: which one?
 wiking	classification is super fast :)
 wiking	MulticlassLibLinear
 blackburn	how much time? d? N?
 blackburn	if you do modelselection enable save train state option
 blackburn	to make training a little faster

 blackburn	wiking: what is epsilon?
 wiking	1e-5
 blackburn	uh that is tough
 blackburn	try larger no need to 1e-5
 wiking	1e-2?
 blackburn	yeah 1e-2 or 1e-3
 wiking	it's funny
 wiking	i have a new kernel
 wiking	but it only works with libsvm
 wiking	other svm die because it cannot find enough support vectors :(
 wiking	but with libsvm it works nice
-!- pluskid [~chatzilla@111.120.11.250] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	wiking: is it proper normalized then?
 wiking	blackburn: you mean the kernel? yes
 blackburn	strange
 wiking	sqrtdiagkernelnormalizer..
 wiking	any suggestion for metal earners?
 wiking	hahahah metalearners  :)
 wiking	stupid autocorrection
 wiking	:>
 blackburn	metal earner lol
 blackburn	wiking: what kind of metalearner?
 wiking	well anything that does a consensus in a good way between various ML classifications
 wiking	because i have some good results with different features.... separately
 wiking	but when i add them together (even with combined kernel) the result degrades :)
 blackburn	uh
 wiking	so it's pretty annoying :)
 sonne|work	wiking: then your normalization sucks
 wiking	sonne|work: hahahahaha any suggestions ? :)
 pluskid	blackburn: I find why LinearRidgeRegression is acting weird :)
 blackburn	pluskid: why?
 pluskid	a small bug
 pluskid	the matrices are not initialized
 pluskid	simple fix :p
 sonne|work	:)
 blackburn	sonne|work: bad boy
 sonne|work	wiking: well do you have the data or do I have it ...
* sonne|work smacks sonney2k
 wiking	:>>>
* sonne|work luckily I am at work
 pluskid	:>
 pluskid	btw I have some suggestions about CMath::twonorm and several related functions
 pluskid	the template function is returning the same type as the argument
 pluskid	for example, when you calculate twonorm for an int32_t vector
 pluskid	you get int32_t result, which would loss a lot of information
 wiking	pluskid: yeah
 wiking	ah ok
 pluskid	I suggest we use float64_t or something for all input types
 wiking	i think in case of qnorm is not like that
 wiking	afaik
 pluskid	why?
 pluskid	have to leave for a while
 wiking	mmm wait i'm mixing now
 pluskid	cu later
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	qnorm is like that as well
 wiking	shouldn't be it should be something like pluskid says
 wiking	there's anyways an explicit casting there
 wiking	when u return float64_t as class T
 sonne|work	wiking: in case when we compute a float64_t anyways yes
 wiking	man it's early here in my head
 wiking	i meant implicit casting..
 wiking	but anyhow yeah it should always return something like float64_t even if the input vector is an int32_t
 sonne|work	wiking: there is always a trade-off
 sonne|work	this can be wanted or not
 sonne|work	when numbers are small the pure int32_t based compuation will use MMX and be very fast
 sonne|work	and correct
 sonne|work	if numbers become too big one needs the float64_t based variant
 sonne|work	computation is slow but this is required for large numbers
 sonne|work	so YMMV
 pluskid	in our current implementation, float64_t is always used in computaion
 pluskid	just when we are returnining, it gets casted to T
 pluskid	I think the trade-off sonne|work mentioned is true
 pluskid	but what we are discussing here is not that issue
 pluskid	we are thinking about whether we should return T or float64_t ?

 wiking	what's a good kernel for sparse features apart from linear?
 n4nd0	well guys I have the first timing results of JL cover tree used from shogun!
 n4nd0	someone expecting :P?
 pluskid	show the data :D
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org/uhOi1#expand
 n4nd0	there is still some space for improvement
 n4nd0	so it is promising
 pluskid	wow
 pluskid	tree construction plus querying
 n4nd0	yeah, everything there
 pluskid	significantly outperforms qsort
 pluskid	correctness of the results validated?
 n4nd0	not for this case I have timed
 pluskid	anyway, it's super cool
 n4nd0	I have validated them for the non-integrated version, they were the same
 pluskid	cool
 n4nd0	so I guess that they must remain, it is just the class used for the cover tree points what changes
 pluskid	I think I should suggest some guys in my lab to try out cover tree in their projects :D
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	I have still some work left to do
 n4nd0	I wanted to see some results fast
 pluskid	sure
 pluskid	encouraging!
 n4nd0	pluskid: I wanted to ask you by the way
 n4nd0	for you accuracy evaluation for KNN
 pluskid	what do you mean?
 n4nd0	I think I could use it to check that everything is alright using the cover tree, right?
 n4nd0	let me see, maybe I am not using the right words
 pluskid	I can't quite catch your meaning
 n4nd0	I don't really remember the exact words
 n4nd0	the first patch you did for shogun
 pluskid	accuracy evaluation?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	then it is what I said ;)
 pluskid	yes
 n4nd0	is that something that can be used to check if the results given by KNN are correct?
 pluskid	why not simply comparing the two results?
 pluskid	covertree and qsort
 n4nd0	yeah sure
 n4nd0	that's the way I do it
 n4nd0	I just wondered if your patch was something "more profesional" to do this
 pluskid	if they are the same, the algorithm should be correct
 pluskid	I don't think so
 n4nd0	ok
 pluskid	my patch is for clustering
 pluskid	here is classification
 n4nd0	ok, my bad :S
 pluskid	I think if two algorithms are the same, they should give the same accuracy
 pluskid	but when they give the same accuracy, they are not necessarily the same :p
 sonne|work	n4nd0: buy you can of course use any of the other evaluation modules that where made for clustering :D
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what do you think about the result?
 sonne|work	very lovely :)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but we can make it better
 sonne|work	that is factor 4 now right?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah
 sonne|work	hmmhh wasn't knn even using multiple threads?
 n4nd0	I have not configured anything for threads
 n4nd0	so I think it is just with one
 n4nd0	the cover tree admits an heuristic to compute the distance
 n4nd0	there is an upper bound
 n4nd0	while computing the distance, if the intermediate result is already higher than this upper bound, one can cut the comptuations
 n4nd0	computations, sorry
 n4nd0	right now I am not doing that, I am just using the method distance in CDistance
 n4nd0	sonne|work: what about including in CDistance this distance computation with the upper bound?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: feel free...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: cool
 n4nd0	I have still some time to have fun with this :D
 n4nd0	I will keep you update
 sonne|work	it is actually not so easy
 n4nd0	sonne|work: why?
 sonne|work	you would need to modify *every* distance function
 n4nd0	my idea was
 n4nd0	just to define it in Euclidian
 n4nd0	do people use KNN with other than that?
 sonne|work	to stop doing computations once a certain distance is reached
 sonne|work	probably
 sonne|work	but agreed euclidian is most important
 n4nd0	I can include the heuristic in Euclidian for the moment
 n4nd0	for the others it would work just fine

@sonney2k	more time to waste on experiments
@sonney2k	why do they do this?
@sonney2k	gsomix, ?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, what does gsomix mean to say?
 wiking	sonney2k: ;D
 blackburn1	lol
 blackburn1	let me check logs
@sonney2k	blackburn1, regarding slavery - long abandoned :-D but all these things I keep repeating to do take like 5 minutes of work and I mentioned them a couple of times already - so I want them to be done.
 blackburn1	sonney2k: oh you take these words seriously ;)
-!- blackburn1 is now known as lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	ok let it be so
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	who stole my nickname
 lisitsyn	ah long stayed web connection
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: ok he said he is corrected however no idea what does it mean :D
 lisitsyn	nevermind he just surprised with 9 slots
@sonney2k	arent we all
@sonney2k	it is like x-mas, easter, birthday all on one day
 lisitsyn	haha
 gsomix	wut?
 lisitsyn	shogun is a serious thing for you ;)
@sonney2k	now I only hope 3 students stick with us after this gsoc
 gsomix	sonney2k, awww. my English is very bad. I mean, that I corrected SG_PROGRESS patch.
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahhh!
 lisitsyn	ohh
 lisitsyn	even I didn't get it
 gsomix	I use too many passive voice. hehe :(
@sonney2k	so that we finally have some kind of developer community
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: have you seen page generator at github?
 lisitsyn	I can't use it while I am only pushermaan
 gsomix	lisitsyn, where is blackburn?
 lisitsyn	nickname is in use by some hanged webchat connection
-!- lisitsyn is now known as shogun-blackburn
 shogun-blackburn	do you like it more?
 wiking	sonney2k: the fork me label on the page was cool!
-!- shogun-blackburn is now known as blackburn_
 gsomix	shogun-blackburn, it sounds like bot.

 blackburn_	gsomix: LIKE A BOSS
 gsomix	blackburn_, huh.
@sonney2k	blackburn_, you remain vodking
 blackburn_	sonney2k: why should I ever stop
 blackburn_	http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=NisCkxU544c
 blackburn_	commit changes! like a boss! promote shogun! like a boss! github workflow! like a boss!
 blackburn_	my own classes! like a boss!
 gsomix	I heard word `vodka'.
 blackburn_	gsomix: I want you to write an essay 'how my life changed when I start shoguning and vodking'
 gsomix	blackburn_, okay, master. =___=
@sonney2k	blackburn_, hilarious
 PhilTillet	lol the chan is going crazy :p
@sonney2k	I think the only sane participant is shogun-buildbot
 PhilTillet	maybe one day the buildbots will have enough artificial intelligence to get crazy aswell :D
@sonney2k	lets hope they don't listen
@sonney2k	blackburn_, can we merge pluskid's LARS etc patch?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: I didn't take a closer look yet but as it is already tested - probably we can
 blackburn_	sonney2k: how would you like to solve Subset problem?
 blackburn_	no typemap for index_t
 blackburn_	so should be a typemap or it should be int32_t as it is but without index_t
 blackburn_	ah you commented it already

@sonney2k	index_t is int32_t so it should just work
 blackburn1	sonney2k: yes but [1,2,3] is probably not int32_t
@sonney2k	that is why I cast things
 blackburn1	sonney2k: have you seen 'refactoring' PR?
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	not sure what to do with it
 blackburn1	sonney2k: I have no words to comment it :D
 blackburn1	sonney2k: there are some PRs sometimes you can stare and stare and stare and nothing to say
@sonney2k	parts are ok parts are not  - and it is soo huge that I don't know
@sonney2k	for example I like the const declarations instead of #defines
@sonney2k	but then it is too big to be merged at once
 blackburn1	sonney2k: are you ok some code uses stl vector in LARS?
 blackburn1	I am not against it while it can be easily refactored next day
@sonney2k	blackburn1, yes - just tell him

 blackburn1	ok
 mohataher	hi, I applied for a GSoC, anywyas, I was working on implementing Convex Multi-class Feature Learning algorithm and I didn't really find any alternative functions in C++ equivalent to Diag(k) in matlab
 mohataher	any suggestions ?
 mohataher	if not, I can manage to implement and test it otherwise
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	hi all
 blackburn1	mohataher: we have one in CMath afaik however it is not any complex
 blackburn1	n4nd0: hey
 mohataher	blackburn1 : I have just looked up the class, seems like I didn't find any functions equivalent to Diag(k), do you know the name of the function in Math.h ?
 blackburn1	mohataher: create_diagonal_matrix
 mohataher	Is it added recently ? my version doesn't have this function, I will update my version and get back to you if I needed. Thanks
 blackburn1	mohataher: depends how old is your version ;)

 wiking	blackburn1: here?
 blackburn1	da
 wiking	cool
 wiking	so whoever made gmm is around?
 wiking	Alesis Novik
 blackburn1	no, he is doing phd in england and seems to be pretty busy
 wiking	i was wondering if anybody would mind if it would be possible that u could preset the kmeans clusters
 wiking	when you want to do gmm
 blackburn1	kind of warm start?
 wiking	yep
 wiking	e.g. u already have a preknowledge about the clusters.
 blackburn1	I don't mind if you do that ;)
 wiking	ok
 wiking	since now i'm testing gmm
 wiking	on a very small dataset
 wiking	and it's horribly slow
 wiking	and as a matter of fact i do have the cluster centers from kmeans...
 wiking	so i thought maybe it'd be good to save some time..
 wiking	but first i'll add some debugging code to gmm
 wiking	and dtrace it or something
 wiking	to see where goes the most calc
 wiking	nyiha
 wiking	most of the cpu time is used by dlasr
 wiking	which is basically max_likelihood calc
 blackburn1	dlasr??
 wiking	it's from lapack
 blackburn1	yes I know that function
 blackburn1	I mean I am surprised ;)
