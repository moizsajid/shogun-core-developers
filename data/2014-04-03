 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Added multilabel reader in LibSVMFile - thanks to Jiaolong
 jiaolong	thoralf: Thank you very much! :)
 thoralf	jiaolong: Thank you for being patient enough and fixing every single issue we had. ;)
 thoralf	How long did it take?  6 months?
 thoralf	:D
 jiaolong	thoralf: Haha, I don't remember.
 thoralf	About the memory leak - I'll create an issue for that.  I'm not sure what we can do about it.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Yes, the lib is from google? Maybe we can ask google. :D
 thoralf	Haha.
 thoralf	"Why is shogun leaking memory when using protobuf library?"
 thoralf	Well, it helped!
 thoralf	Damn!
 thoralf	google::protobuf::ShutdownProtobufLibrary();
 thoralf	First hit.
 thoralf	I feel like someone opened my head and attached some wires to my brain.

 vvu|Log	hello! I have compiled shogun 3.1.1 from github with pythonmodular option in cmake. when i try to do import modshogun i get that libshogun.so.16 is not found. as i see it swig does not find it in the right place.
 vvu|Log	here is my pastebin http://pastebin.com/uEkAxBKn
 thoralf	vvu|Log: I guess you ran a "make install", right?  Can you tell me 1. where you install shogun, i.e. the full path to libshogun.so.16 and 2. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

 thoralf	Hey jiaolong
 jiaolong	hello
 jiaolong	how is going?
 thoralf	Fine:)
 jiaolong	you have solved the problem?
 thoralf	A bit late already, so soon going to bed :)
 thoralf	I solved the problem; will commit tomorrow.
 jiaolong	Good! Congraculations!
 jiaolong	thoralf: Good night!
 thoralf	jiaolong: How are your PRs going?
 jiaolong	thoralf: I have done three. There is still one under finishing.
 jiaolong	thoralf: The factor graph for multilabel classification.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Accuracy is not good.
 thoralf	Oh, why?
 jiaolong	thoralf: I am still discussing with shell.
 jiaolong	thoralf: I think the implementation is correct. Probably we have to tune parameters.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Well, the tree structure is slightly different to our baseline and that may also cause the difference in accuracy.
 thoralf	jiaolong: you checked inference?  loss function?  generation of joint feature vectors?
 jiaolong	thoralf: Yes, shell also suggested me to do that. I can do it in this weekend.
 thoralf	Hmm, yeah.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Too many details to check!
 thoralf	Hard to say what's happening.
 thoralf	But it's always this way.
 thoralf	Something is strange and you have to check every single step... did this many times. :(
 jiaolong	thoralf: Yes, I need to understand the code better.
 jiaolong	thoralf: I hope our implementation is comparable to pystruct.
 thoralf	jiaolong: Maybe understand SO learning better and try to check it high level... like duality gap, value of objectives, etc.
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, I will check it. Thanks!
 jiaolong	thoralf: Maybe also check pystruct to understand the difference.
 thoralf	Yeah, having two equivalent implementations is great.  Try this first.
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK
 thoralf	Try to change the model so it's comparable.  Just minik everything.  Then compare.
 thoralf	Worst case do some math on paper to proof it's equivalent if the representation is different...
