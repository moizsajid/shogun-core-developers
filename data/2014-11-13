 Heikotablet	wiking, whatsup
 wiking	Heikotablet: do u have matlab at UCL?
 Heikotablet	Yes
 wiking	Heikotablet: ok then get a machine + matlab + buildbot
@HeikoS	wiking: can do that I think
@HeikoS	wiking: can I use my desktop?
@HeikoS	wiking: its 24/7
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	u can
@HeikoS	but can only install ubuntu package
 wiking	that's ok
@HeikoS	I dont have full admin rights
@HeikoS	but can instal anything from repo
 wiking	mmm question of course is
 wiking	whether u can open a custom port :P
 wiking	although no
 wiking	it's ok
 wiking	so u just need to
 wiking	apt-get install buildbot-slave
@HeikoS	let me try
 wiking	and then the rest we can figure out
 wiking	HeikoS: do u have g++ on that machine? :P
 wiking	i guess os or?
 wiking	*so
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah yeah, I also use shogun on it
@HeikoS	remember all my questions a while ago?
@HeikoS	our cluster consists of all our desktop machines
 wiking	yeah ok because then we can haz swig-matlab
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome!
 wiking	now the only question remains
@HeikoS	ok installed buildbot slave
 wiking	ok
 wiking	lemme set it up
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you need from me?
 wiking	HeikoS: i'm just writin you in pm

@HeikoS	wiking: might be cool for release, at least experimental
@HeikoS	but I dont know how much work typemaps are
@HeikoS	wiking: we should definitely take the opportunity to unit test the maps systematically as a draft for how to test the existing ones

@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hey
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: jfyi I am ok with your date to talk about vw
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good to know
@HeikoS	lets see what john says
@HeikoS	s
@HeikoS	sorry for postponing all the time
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: np I am sick today anyway
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  did he reply?
@HeikoS	nope not yet
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: not yet
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/11/11/the-hipster-effect-interactive/
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha I saw that paper
@HeikoS	nice that they have a nbotebook
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: it ain't them
@lisitsyn	it's jake from scikit learn
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: can you recommend me something to read about variational inference?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	chris bishops book
@lisitsyn	I am tired of being stupid :D
@HeikoS	pattern recognition and machine learning
@HeikoS	its the probabilistic ML bible
@lisitsyn	hmm I think I glanced through it before
@HeikoS	or Wu's notebook
@HeikoS	its an easy idea
@HeikoS	distribution is intractable
@HeikoS	so you select one that you can deal with (mostly gaussian)
@HeikoS	and then minimise KL div between approximation and true
@lisitsyn	so in layman terms
@lisitsyn	you just fit multidimensional gaussian to the distribution?
@lisitsyn	via KL?
@HeikoS	kind of
@HeikoS	its not really the same as fitting the gaussian
@HeikoS	minimizing KL is different
@HeikoS	kullback leibler divergence
@lisitsyn	yeah I know
@lisitsyn	so you have that integral
@HeikoS	some kind of distance between distributions
@HeikoS	but not symmetric
@HeikoS	and then you usually do this via maximising a lower bound
@HeikoS	the KL gives you a lower bound on the likelihood of the distrbution you care about
@lisitsyn	I don't get one thing yet
@HeikoS	the bound is usually not tight (thats why its approximate) but you just hope for the best
@lisitsyn	so are we talking about inference or training?
@HeikoS	getting posterior
@HeikoS	have a representation of posterior
@HeikoS	that is kind of training
@lisitsyn	is posterior usually a gaussian?
@HeikoS	but if you have a gaussian posterior, usually inference is easy
@HeikoS	no usually not
@HeikoS	thats why the approximation
@lisitsyn	but you approximate with gaussian, right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	kind of most cases
@HeikoS	but sometimes you just assume a certain type of factorisation
@HeikoS	that is you assume certain variables in posterior are independent
@HeikoS	and then a parametric form of posterior (that is not gaussian) drops out of the model math
@HeikoS	for example for LDA for topic modelling that happens
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm I see
@HeikoS	variational bayes there is very similar to gibbs sampling updates
@HeikoS	with the posterior approximations happening to be discrete /dirichlet
@HeikoS	I gotta run off now, we can discuss a little later today if you want
@lisitsyn	sure
@HeikoS	see you  :)
@lisitsyn	thanks
@lisitsyn	see you
@HeikoS	Ill be back soon, just a talk now

@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  re
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: cool
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I can ask you random questions if you are not busy :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: please do
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you were talking about gaussian posterior
@lisitsyn	but what's about other distributions?
@HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	is it kind of engineering to choose the distribution
@HeikoS	as said, for discrete posteriors, one usually things are different
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: not really, the point about Gaussians is that one can integrate over them
@HeikoS	but if you say learn a Gaussian mixture model
@HeikoS	you do the same thing
@HeikoS	you minimise the KL between the posterior and the mixture
@HeikoS	for standard GMM, one can do that in closed form and gets EM algoirithm
@HeikoS	but for other mixture models, that might not be possible
@HeikoS	so usually Gaussian, yes
@lisitsyn	how inaccurate it is?
@HeikoS	it depends on your posterior
@HeikoS	if it doesnt look like a Gaussian
@HeikoS	its not accurate
@HeikoS	but you dont know how it looks
@lisitsyn	hmm say I have features obtained from layer 2 of some deep learning net
@HeikoS	so you dont know how accurate variational inference is
@lisitsyn	will it be consistent to just try gaussian?
@lisitsyn	I am just trying to get the thought behind it
@HeikoS	what is the model
@lisitsyn	what do you mean?
@HeikoS	if you want to do variational inference you need a model
@HeikoS	usually one starts with the model, and then comes up with inference algroithms for it
@lisitsyn	ahh no I am speaking quite general
@HeikoS	so what do you want to do?
@lisitsyn	is possible models class broad?
@HeikoS	it is an algorithm that characterises a posterior distribution
@HeikoS	so *any* probabilistic model
@lisitsyn	ahm I see
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I was talking about gps recently
@lisitsyn	and was asked
@lisitsyn	what is this limitation of 'answer' being gaussian
@lisitsyn	like is it very restrictive
@lisitsyn	and I still don't have a real answer :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you think?
@HeikoS	the limitation is that your predictive uncertainty when you integrate over the posterior might be wrong
@HeikoS	btw depends on what kind of gp
@HeikoS	since for example regression is analytically tractable, posterior *is* gaussian
@HeikoS	classification, it is not
@HeikoS	but it usually is close to being Gaussian
@lisitsyn	is regression always gaussian like?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	posterior is closed form
@lisitsyn	ah
@lisitsyn	ok I see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/yorkerlin/d991d9c0c7eeb14a62ff
@HeikoS	wu put pictures of posterior and approximations to it
@lisitsyn	let me check
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay next random :D
@lisitsyn	there is a book
@lisitsyn	let me find
@HeikoS	ah he did not put the plot
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but you can download and run
@lisitsyn	ten lectures on statistical and structural pattern recognition
@lisitsyn	have you seen that?
@lisitsyn	http://books.google.ru/books/about/Ten_Lectures_on_Statistical_and_Structur.html?id=VLI2u3oVkAoC&redir_esc=y
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	but i really reccomend the GP book by rasmussen and the ML book by bishop
@HeikoS	these two are really really good books
@lisitsyn	ah yeah that's for sure
@lisitsyn	but it was a random question ;)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: the thing is this book comes from some years before
@lisitsyn	and they think about say Wald, Neyman-Pearson tasks
@lisitsyn	some Anderson task etc
@lisitsyn	like P(error) < e
@lisitsyn	or anything like that
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	well
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: so my question is whether it is dead
@HeikoS	I dont like this kind of statistic
@lisitsyn	why?
@HeikoS	personal taste
@HeikoS	not bayesian
@HeikoS	not powerful
@HeikoS	small d, small n
@HeikoS	more like foundations
@lisitsyn	hmm I see
@HeikoS	im more a computational statistics boy :)
-!- rajul [~rajul@117.199.144.26] has quit [Ping timeout: 265 seconds]
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you said about small d small n
@lisitsyn	is it working well under these circumstances?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: these methods attack different problems
@HeikoS	so you cannot really compare
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am just trying to get what's really wrong about it
@lisitsyn	the only thing I can say is that you don't know P anyway
@lisitsyn	so speaking about P(error) is kind of wrong
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	nothing wrong about it
@HeikoS	but everything depends on what you want to do
@HeikoS	if you want to do hypothesis testing, then this is the way to go
@HeikoS	all tools
@HeikoS	how good they are depends on what you want to do
@lisitsyn	say when would you choose variational inference?
@lisitsyn	or more important - when would you choose something else :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: let me attack it like that - NNs are good at images/audio now
 wiking	alalallaalaaaaaaaaaaaaa
@HeikoS	again
@HeikoS	variational inference is an inference algorithm
@HeikoS	it is not like you decide to use it
@HeikoS	you first need to define your problem
@HeikoS	and your model
@HeikoS	the model is the critical part
@HeikoS	not the inference algoirithm
@HeikoS	you dont choose to use variational inference, you choose to do a probabilistic model
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: okay then how would you choose to do probabilistic model?
@HeikoS	it depends on what you want to do
 wiking	choose to drink :D
@HeikoS	for example if you want to understand the process you are modelling
@lisitsyn	wiking: haha
@HeikoS	or if uncertainty is important for you
@HeikoS	wiking: haha
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: oh that seems legit
@lisitsyn	answers my question :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: example might be classification
@HeikoS	if you are interested in confidence
@HeikoS	and maybe have some complicated relationship that you would like to take into account for classification
 wiking	'Column indexes start at 1 in JDBC'
@HeikoS	say a group like strucutre that share hyper-parameters
@HeikoS	and are interested in how these parameters look since that tells you something about the world
 wiking	why on fucking earth would anybody start indexing with 1
@HeikoS	then a probabilisti model might be good for oyu
@HeikoS	wiking: I recently got the same question with 0 :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: is it moving towards something more automatic?
 wiking	HeikoS: lemme guess... matlab developer? :D
@lisitsyn	I mean neural guys claim they have feature learning
@lisitsyn	is there any work on try to pass raw features and get something of it?
 wiking	you can learn anyting with an NN.. give that you have enough time/examples :d
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah absolutely but that's why I don't like what neural is all about
@HeikoS	wiking: no proper scientists :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: that is about representation learning
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  kind of orthogonal to probabilistic modelling, and quite a different goal also
@HeikoS	probabilistic models are for somethign for scientists who want to understand the world better
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I see
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but there are lots of connections between back propagation and stochastic variational inference, kind of the same in fact ;)
