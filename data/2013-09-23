@Heikowankenobi	lambday: got other plans for tomorrow? :)
 lambday	Heikowankenobi: yeah... really gotta get into insti stuffs now
 lambday	Heikowankenobi: I'll remove the outputs
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: I would like to see the thing finished before tomorrow night, but dont worry if you are in trouble
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: the histogram should be easy to fix though
@Heikowankenobi	just hist of the samples you already have in there
@Heikowankenobi	two lines
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: but yeah not really ultra important
 lambday	Heikowankenobi: yeah once I figure out how to plot it properly its not much work
 lambday	histograms are always confusing to me :-/

@Heikowankenobi	lambday: didnt I give you code?
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: ah yes, that is what I had in mind, but that is in fact stupid
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: so lets just install everything on the notebook machine
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: dont worry about this then, sorry for the confusion
@Heikowankenobi	histogram plotting is very easy
@Heikowankenobi	try this:
 lambday	Heikowankenobi: yeah it should be, otherwise just blank outputs in the notebooks won't be useful :(
@Heikowankenobi	hist(randn(1000)*0.2)
@Heikowankenobi	and then hist(randn(1000))
@Heikowankenobi	automagically puts them in one plot with different colours
 lambday	Heikowankenobi: alright trying
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: exactly, blanking is not useful
@Heikowankenobi	lambday: and then legend(["a", "b"])
@Heikowankenobi	and then maybe
@Heikowankenobi	plot([true_logdet, true_logdet], [0,some-value], linewidth=3) for the true value line

@iglesiasg	hushell, hi!
 hushell	iglesiasg: how is going?
@iglesiasg	hushell, just fine, for you?
 hushell	iglesiasg: could you help me merge the last PR?
@iglesiasg	hushell, did you update the file loading after you submited the new data file in shogun-data?

@iglesiasg	hushell, I mean in the notebook
@iglesiasg	hushell, since the file changed, I guess the notebook needed to be updated as well
 hushell	iglesiasg: let me double check, but I remember it should be there
 hushell	iglesiasg: yeah, I used the correct file name
@iglesiasg	hushell, oook then we should be ready to go

 sonne|work	gsomix: any news on protobuf?
 sonne|work	foulwall: ping?
 gsomix	sonne|work, yep. added set/get_matrix methods and types into Chunks.proto
 sonne|work	gsomix: ok so I guess vector / matrix are done then right?
 gsomix	sonne|work, writing macro and unit-tests
 gsomix	sonne|work, btw why we need uint64_t for lenght of vector?
 gsomix	*length
 sonne|work	gsomix: if so please send a PR for that and then we still have to do SGStringLists (which is easy - just the same as vector but multiple of them) and sparse
 sonne|work	gsomix: it might become bigger than uint32 at some point and protbuf will not waste bytes anyway so whenever you write uint32 there you could as well just use uint64
 gsomix	sonne|work, ah, ok.
 sonne|work	gsomix: the only question remains if we want to represent sparse/strings as efficient as possible or as convenient as possible
 gsomix	sonne|work, so it means that sizes of messages should be uint64_t too, right?
 sonne|work	gsomix: I mean one could write out huge arrays with the values and then with the indices separately

 sonne|work	gsomix: yeah why not
 sonne|work	(but 1MB * 2**32 is hard to reach I guess...)
 sonne|work	but doesn't hurt
 gsomix	ok
 sonne|work	gsomix: so any thoughts about sparse?
 sonne|work	gsomix: what do you prefer? writing out all nnz values in one go?
 sonne|work	so basically column compressed storage like?
 sonne|work	I guess that would be most efficient (space wise etc) for the file
 gsomix	sonne|work, << convenient as possible | <ShogunVersion> <SparseMatrix header> <SparseVector 1 header> <data messages> ... and so on
 gsomix	but I'm not sure
 sonne|work	and I also guess speed wise since you can write big chunks of 1 MB all the time
 sonne|work	one could do the same for strings
 sonne|work	I mean write out the huge block of strings (all strings concatenated)
 sonne|work	and the string lengths
 sonne|work	I guess we should do it this way since one might have say 100 million strings of small length
 gsomix	sonne|work, yep, I think so.
 sonne|work	and then the overhead would be drastic if not done otherwise
 sonne|work	same with sparse
 sonne|work	gsomix: so do strings first right after your next PR
 sonne|work	and hurry up man!
 gsomix	sonne|work, ok

 besser82	sonne|work: will be finished within next ~2-3 days
 sonne|work	besser82: not sure what you are saying but any help welcome :)
 besser82	sonne|work: I currently refactoring the CMake-buildsys in agreement with wiking, to get out all glitches and/or quick'n'dirty workarounds ;)
 sonne|work	ahh nice
 gsomix	sonne|work, ok. I need cup of tea and then will do string lists
 besser82	sonne|work: so everything will be run out of src tree and lots of other stuff to come ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: even with testsuite being able to be run from build-tree ;)
 sonne|work	gsomix: please fix the PR and then comment the PROTOBUF detection and let me merge it
 sonne|work	then continue
 sonne|work	besser82: ahh nice highly needed
 sonne|work	besser82: even more important currently is that one cannot build shogun when it is already installed in /usr/local due to include clashes
 besser82	sonne|work: np. will be fixed, too ;)
 sonne|work	so include path order needs to be changed
 sonne|work	besser82: ahh ok then just do whatever you do :)
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: do you agree with me to restructure source-tree as well? Like placing headers in seperate dir and suchss
 besser82	s/ss/?/g
 sonne|work	besser82: errm you mean shogun/src ?
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: yes
 sonne|work	what is wrong / what would you do?
 besser82	sonne|work: nothing really wrong, but would be abit "?bersichtlicher" ;)
 sonne|work	well make an example
 besser82	sonne|work: now it is src/shogun/*/*.{h,c,cpp,py,...}
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	and cxx once swig is done
 sonne|work	and .cc for protobuf later too
 besser82	sonne|work: I think having it like src/include, src/shogun and so on
 besser82	sonne|work: swig and protobuf will get generated out of tree ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: like build/$cloned_dir_structure/...
 sonne|work	sounds very reasonable
 sonne|work	but I cannot speak for all
 besser82	sonne|work: who else to ask?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg, lisitsyn, wiking, van51 - any thoughts on besser82's suggestion?
@iglesiasg	let me read
 sonne|work	besser82: well HeikoS and the ones above :)
@iglesiasg	besser82, so headers in a separate soource tree?
@iglesiasg	I think I have to look up "?bersichtlicher" :D
 besser82	iglesiasg: yes, and probably *.py as well
 besser82	iglesiasg: ?bersichtlicher == clear, more semantic  ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, hehe yeah just saw
@iglesiasg	besser82, so it is basically a matter of taste, right?
@iglesiasg	no technical advantages/disadvantages?
 besser82	iglesiasg: a matter of taste, common-sense and good pratice ;)
 besser82	iglesiasg: mashing up all in one dir or so was from "old" autocrap" times ;)
@iglesiasg	besser82, hehe
@iglesiasg	for me it is fine, sure
 besser82	iglesiasg: kk, just the rest's agreement required, then ;)
@iglesiasg	I think I have seen this headers/implementation files separation in PCL before
@iglesiasg	the first second I was like wtf!?! hehe
 besser82	iglesiasg: and some other projects as well ;)  might be a bit confusing on the first look :D
@iglesiasg	:)
 besser82	iglesiasg: main goal is to have clear seperation between sources and build-tree, headers and impl, different stuff from impl
 sonne|work	besser82: what needs attention here is that we want at some point follow the d pointer approach
 sonne|work	besser82: i.e. only have interfaces .h files exposed to the outside
 sonne|work	and encapsulate the rest in Impl classes
 sonne|work	so one would just have to copy headers over
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, let's check how they do it in QT then
 sonne|work	currently headers are both interface and whatever
 besser82	sonne|work: so you want to have distiction between interf-haeders and impl-headers, right?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	I mean if you restructure then lets not do that again in a few months
 besser82	sonne|work: would be really easy with that split dir approach ;)
@iglesiasg	so QT people have in the same dirs cpp, and h files
 sonne|work	well how?
 besser82	sonne|work: let's split-up the include-dir to interface and impl ;)
@iglesiasg	but maybe I guess it should not be a limitation to separate them in order to use d pointer
 besser82	iglesiasg, sonne|work: let's split-up the include-dir to interface and impl ;)
 lisitsyn1	yes I like splitting
 lisitsyn1	besser82: sonne|work: ^
 besser82	iglesiasg, sonne|work: like include/implementation  include/public
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1 prolly A.vim won't work any longer
* besser82 lisitsyn1  +1  :D
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: yeah true
 besser82	sonne|work, lisitsyn1: you don't use eclipse ???  XD
 sonne|work	iglesiasg, besser82 actually the d ptr stuff shouldn't need includes at all or?

 sonne|work	besser82: nope vim
 sonne|work	I mean non public includes
 besser82	sonne|work: afaik, no
 lisitsyn1	besser82: I don't
 sonne|work	besser82: I am failing to do this properly with C++
 besser82	sonne|work: what dpointer, seperated includes or eclipse???
@iglesiasg	besser82, http://qt-project.org/wiki/Dpointer
@iglesiasg	besser82,  and this one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer
 besser82	sonne|work: So dpointers should be pretty straight forward with c++

 sonne|work	besser82: there probably is but not here I am afraid
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm afraid, too  :(   But I just wanted to ask here, since it's perfectly about BRs of SHOGUN ;)
 lisitsyn1	yeah d-pointers are easy
 sonne|work	BRs ?
 lisitsyn1	struct Impl;
 lisitsyn1	Impl* impl;
 lisitsyn1	that's it :D
 besser82	sonne|work: BuildRequires
 besser82	sonne|work: like build-deps in Debian ;)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn1: yeah but the difficulty is to do the proper interface - so not at all easy!
 lisitsyn1	sonne|work: what inteface?
 besser82	lisitsyn1: to the hidden impl ;)
 sonne|work	yeah which functions do you expose and which not
 lisitsyn1	it is up to you, what is proper here?
 sonne|work	this decision!
 lisitsyn1	you don't expose anything
 sonne|work	yeah difficult to decide
 besser82	lisitsyn1: you expose public interfaces
 besser82	lisitsyn1: which should be kept binary compatible
 lisitsyn1	class PublicObject
 lisitsyn1	{
 lisitsyn1	public: void doStuff();
 lisitsyn1	private: struct Impl; Impl* impl;
 lisitsyn1	}
 besser82	lisitsyn1: that's what dpointer are about ;)
 lisitsyn1	what to expose here?
 sonne|work	van51: btw nice ipython notebook!
 lisitsyn1	besser82: are you talking about setting that Impl with some public interface to stone?
 lisitsyn1	I don't care about binary compatibility to be honest hehe
 lisitsyn1	I don't see we slow down API changes
 van51	sonne|work: thanks! let me know if you have any suggestions about it
 sonne|work	van51: Well only thing that is sub-optimal is that you didnt' re-run the tests for spectrum etc in that comparison
 sonne|work	apart from that all good
 van51	sonne|work: hmm I can run them then and update it accordingly
@iglesiasg	van51, I am reading it atm :)
 sonne|work	van51: maybe this is sth for your kitchen sinks http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/assets/pubs/vedaldi11efficient.pdf
 sonne|work	we have that as homegenous kernel map currently in shogun
 sonne|work	but not as dot features
 van51	iglesiasg: cool :) if you also have any suggestions feel free to tell me!
@iglesiasg	van51, one question!
 van51	sonne|work: I will take a look
 van51	iglesiasg: shoot
@iglesiasg	van51, "First of all, the dimensionality of the feature space (or else, the number of distinct tokens in the collection) is usually not known beforehand and requires a pass over the entire dataset to be calculated. This can make the creation of the document-term matrix trickier."
@iglesiasg	van51, why does it get trickier if you have to do a first pass to count the number of distinct tokens?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: online learning?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: you don't know the number of dims beforehand
@iglesiasg	true, it is an issue in online learning
 sonne|work	so what do you do then
@iglesiasg	I didn't consider it
@iglesiasg	van51, so a shy suggestion from my part is to say that ^ becomes an issue in online learning :)
 van51	iglesiasg: yes I could elaborate a bit more there
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: even in the standard case you would have to compute all e.g. n-grams to determine the biggest index
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, but that is something you would need to do afterwards anyway, right?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well you do it while training only...
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, sure. I am talking about training
 sonne|work	so you don't have these all available explictly
@iglesiasg	van51, cool notebook indeed! It's nice to know more about your project
 van51	iglesiasg: I'm glad that you like it
 van51	all the other notebooks I 've seen looked very detailed and well-worked that I was worried that mine was kind of sloppy

@HeikoS	votjakovr: hey!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: thanks for the latest patch, any thoughts about the surface plot of the ML?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: also, I wanted to hear about the notebook
@HeikoS	did you see the draft?
 sonne|work	besser82: there is HeikoS!
@HeikoS	sonne|work: ah, what did I do wrong? :)
 besser82	HeikoS: nothing ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: hi then :)
 besser82	HeikoS: You'rethe last one to vote ;)
@HeikoS	vote?
@HeikoS	GPU based eigen3 backends :D
@HeikoS	??
 besser82	HeikoS: Let's make that german ;)
@HeikoS	distributed matrix matrix multiplication :D ? :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi! I haven't think about surface plot yet :) Now i'm working on hiv example
@HeikoS	votjakovr: okay, dont worry aobut the surface plot for now, maybe later
 votjakovr	HeikoS: how is it better to solve the problem? classify R5X4 vs all?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: okay cool, do things work?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: did you have a look into the paper?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: very briefly
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I forgot what I exactly did back then, but got very good performance
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah I think thats a sensible idea to do
 votjakovr	HeikoS: just for sure: we get protein sequences and usage of coreceptor
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah you just get two sets of sequences for the alphabet of aminoacids (20 letters)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: there might be some letters in there that correspond do "dont know" or so, and shogun might complain about that, but its not very important for distant-segments string kernel, only for the specturm kernel we have in shogun
 besser82	sonne|work: Heiko says +1, too :D
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hmm i've downloaded the data and protein's string length are different
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ~ 33-37 characters
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yes, thats the point of string kernels
@HeikoS	they can handle different lengths
@HeikoS	votjakovr: magic, isnt it ? :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok cool :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: so we decided to classify R5X4 vs R5 and X4, right?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: the kernel has two parameters
@HeikoS	votjakovr: which you cannot choose via gradient descent
@HeikoS	they are discrete
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep i see
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so I just realised we at some point need something to do a grid-search using the marginal likelihood ;)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ah :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but that also later
@HeikoS	the string example is just to demonstrate how cool we are ;)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: huh
 votjakovr	HeikoS: BTW thank you, for the cool notebook draft :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: no worries, its just a very basic skeleton yet. I will do some parts for toy GP classification now if you dont mind?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, thanks

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: some updates on binary classification
@HeikoS	votjakovr: the mean function in shogun is limited to R^n right?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ah thats annoying, I totally missed that
 votjakovr	HeikoS: currently yes
@HeikoS	votjakovr:  in fact the mean function should be defined as m(x) : Y^n -> R
@HeikoS	shit
@HeikoS	its like the kernel/covariance, defined on features
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok, we cannot change that now
@HeikoS	have to postpone
@HeikoS	votjakovr: sorry for having missed that :(
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I mean it is possible, but we will have to change a few internals for that
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ah, me too
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok then, we will have to skip the string GP
@HeikoS	and rather go for some other std datasets
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I suggest you do the UCI glass dataset
@HeikoS	window-glass vs non-window glass
@HeikoS	in fact, I should have code for that somewhere, let me search
@HeikoS	votjakovr: https://github.com/karlnapf/kameleon-mcmc/blob/master/main/gp/GPData.py
@HeikoS	there I load the glass data, its the file from
@HeikoS	votjakovr: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and https://github.com/karlnapf/kameleon-mcmc/blob/master/main/gp/scripts/glass_gaussian_ard.py loads the data and preprocesses it
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe start with that first
@HeikoS	votjakovr: btw I just updated the notebook, so make sure to rebase from time to time to avoid clashes
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oh, thanks
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I have to go now, will be back later tonight, might be after the deadline
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but dont worry, will still merge things then :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but try to finish this glass dataset at least, and if you find time, go for some regression data
@HeikoS	votjakovr: if things are not completely polished by tonight, we can still improve things before the release. Though it would be good if you added stuff today.
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ok, see you later!
 votjakovr	HeikoS: see you

@sonney2k	gsomix, well done
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok. fixing types
@sonney2k	gsomix, now all that is left after the minor fixes is sparse
 gsomix	and sparse next, yes. it will be easy and very similar to string lists
@sonney2k	gsomix, lets just now discuss sparse matrices
@sonney2k	I think it is best if you write it out in column compressed storage http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node92.html#SECTION00931200000000000000
@sonney2k	which means you have to write out 3 arrays
@sonney2k	gsomix, around and understood?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
@sonney2k	it might be a bit confusing in the beginning...
 gsomix	reading
@sonney2k	gsomix, basically all the nonzero entries are in the val array
@sonney2k	gsomix, these are the things we have in the SGSparseVectorEntry.entry's
@sonney2k	gsomix, actually you could do it indeed the same way like strings
@sonney2k	gsomix, you just have to write the values in the entry (the way you write strings) and in addition the values feat_index (also the same way you write strings)
@sonney2k	and then an array with the lengths of the sparse vectors (same as length of strings)
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha, I see.
@sonney2k	gsomix, this is then almost the CCS format
@sonney2k	gsomix, basically val == array of entries
@sonney2k	row_ind == array of feat_index
@sonney2k	col_ptr is different
@sonney2k	it is cumsum(sparse vector lengths)
@sonney2k	gsomix, does that make sense / is it clear?
 gsomix	sonney2k, but there is one question. should I store val and row_ind in series? or I can write pairs?
@sonney2k	or Qs?
@sonney2k	gsomix, write it in series
@sonney2k	no pairs (slow!)
 gsomix	I mean one data message is <<part of val array> <part of row_ind array>>
 gsomix	or <part of val> <part of val> ... <part of row_ind> <part of row_ind> ... and so on
@sonney2k	gsomix, like this
@sonney2k	repeated int32 feat_indices;
@sonney2k	repeated (whatever chunk type) values;
@sonney2k	van51, looks nice - but give some example with a dataset we have in data for people to try out
@sonney2k	van51, maybe even create a data symlink in that application dir
@sonney2k	van51, and then have it ready
 gsomix	sonney2k, in one message? so I need add new types in Chunks, right?
 gsomix	ah, ok, it's clear

 votjakovr	HeikoS: PruneVarSubMean
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I see
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe do a whitening and remove mean combination? its almost always used in conjunction
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oh, yeah, this is not a problem
@HeikoS	votjakovr: cool!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I like that you do that! :)
* gsomix z-z-z-z
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: there is something about whitening in the PCA preprocessor too
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: maybe you want to check it
 gsomix	nite guys. it seems I need sleep a little
@HeikoS	gsomix: night!
@iglesiasg	votjakovr: I took a look yesterday but didn't find it quite similar to the whitening I learnt so... :D
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: PCA is very similar to whitening
@iglesiasg	gsomix: good night proto-buffer! :P

 votjakovr	HeikoS: btw i was thinking about mean functions... And i noticed, that it doesn't really metter what type of features we are using for zero mean function, for example
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yep Zero/Constant mean is independent of the feature type
@HeikoS	votjakovr: in fact mean functions should be defined on CFeatures objects
@HeikoS	so you could just change the interface and since we dont have other means, that change would not be a lot of work
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, that what i thought!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: cool, feel free to change
@HeikoS	votjakovr: what other things would have to be changed? not many I guess
@HeikoS	votjakovr: Do you know if GPstuff can do GPs on non-numerical data?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I know GPML cannot
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so would be very very cool to have
 votjakovr	HeikoS: GPstuff also can't
@HeikoS	votjakovr: killer feature then ;)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: need refactor CMeanFunction a little bit to make it works
 votjakovr	HeikoS: btw how often is GPs used in practice?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i've found not too much applications
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ehm ...
@HeikoS	votjakovr: one of the most fundamental methods in statistics ;)
@HeikoS	used all over the place in spatio temporal statistics
@HeikoS	votjakovr: its just not that popular as SVMs, since its a bit harder to understand, but its also more powerful
@HeikoS	votjakovr: in fact, there is not really a nice impleentation out there
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but we changed this now partly
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oh :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: biologists also use them very often
@HeikoS	votjakovr: sometimes in different froms, but the core idea is the same
@HeikoS	votjakovr: we can extend our framework to more cutting edge methods though .... the stuff in there is very fundamental but a bit old-school ;)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: next thing should some some nice multiclass stuff
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and then of course sparsity extensions? aka relevance vector machine
@HeikoS	they scale linearly in the nubmer of training points
 votjakovr	HeikoS: cool :)

@iglesiasg	mmm I guess this week there should be weekly report mail as well, right?
 votjakovr	iglesiasg: hmm it seems nobody have sent a report
@HeikoS	no need for a report, send you notebooks ;)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: notebook is still in process
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: all right!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: looking forward to see
 votjakovr	:)
@iglesiasg	I sent a new update yesterday, but I think I am going to do a small thing now before going to bed
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I have written some more things, pushing now
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: aah true you already saw and commented what I pushed yesterday, thanks btw :)

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: another paragraph on inference for binary classification
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: welcome :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: feedback is very important for the notebooks, even more than for code
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: if you can give some more feedback to others, in particular those who haven't received some yet
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oh thanks, rebasing...
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: all right
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: I started reading lambday's notebook yesterday
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: cool, also have a look at van51s
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: but I have to admit I quit after some minutes and left it for another moment
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I gave lambday a *lot* of feedback already, also the stats prof here and the other mentor did
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: yeah, already checked van's and told him one minor thing
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: try to focus on having things look very cool
