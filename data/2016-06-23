 OXPHOS	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: jo
@HeikoS	was just looking for you
@HeikoS	so about the macros, did wiking explain how to do it?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: not yet..@wiking
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: asked google?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: tried..
 c4goldsw	HeikoS: almost done.  Just getting over some type mismatch errors.
@HeikoS	c4goldsw: great
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: ok pls ping him thoroughly
-!- c4goldsw [5da420e6@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.93.164.32.230] has quit [Client Quit]
@HeikoS	he tends to disappear when asking for details on what he means :)
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: haha sure
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: until then, leave the macro in
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: the problem is - how to call linalgbackendeigen.dot method from the linalgbackendbase* ?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: not sure
@HeikoS	what you mean
@HeikoS	line?
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: so once the user assigns a backend, like sg_linalg->set_gpu_backend(new LinalgBackendViennaCL());
 OXPHOS	it is casted to linalgbackendbase*
@HeikoS	no need to cast
@HeikoS	since it extends linalgbackendbase
@lambday	OXPHOS: overriding :)
@HeikoS	lambday: joooo
@lambday	HeikoS: hola
 OXPHOS	when i try to call sg_linalg->get_gpu_backend()->dot(a, b);
@lambday	HeikoS: how's it going?
@HeikoS	lambday: you have an idea how to avoid macros / explicit using c++11 ?
@HeikoS	lambday: good here
@HeikoS	lambday: have to go soon
@HeikoS	but just wanted to check that all is going fine
 OXPHOS	i **think** it is overriding, but the pointer is base type
@lambday	HeikoS: can you have a quick look at the gaussian kernel patch? travis is green now
 OXPHOS	so it won't even consider the derived methods
@lambday	HeikoS: sorry I don't have an idea..
@lambday	those methods are virtual.. they can't be templated
@lambday	my fucking screen is broken.. I can't see the left side of the screen it's all blurry white lines argh!
@HeikoS	lambday: gotta go, see you

@lambday	OXPHOS: yo
 OXPHOS	sooooooo fast
 OXPHOS	lambday: hi
 OXPHOS	lambday: none of you cares about the vote :)?
@lambday	OXPHOS: pointer is of base type ==> that's how runtime polymorphism is achived
 OXPHOS	yep
@lambday	OXPHOS: I'll be out of here in a month.. can't care less :D
 OXPHOS	good call
@lambday	but if you ask me, I should say that it should stay in the EU
@lambday	OXPHOS: so, are you clear about how the thing works?
 OXPHOS	I have no standpoint at all. just gossiping
 OXPHOS	nope..let me explain
@lambday	shoot!
@lambday	bazdmeg: bazdmeg
 OXPHOS	so in the unit-test, i called: linalgns::dot(a, b); where a and b are both SGVector on gpu (true)
@lambday	(why 'ns' :/, just wondering)
 OXPHOS	hence it should run sg_linalg->get_gpu_backend()->dot(a, b);
@lambday	OXPHOS: yep
 OXPHOS	and call linalgbackendviennacl.dot, as the registered backend is that
@lambday	OXPHOS: ye[
@lambday	p
 OXPHOS	but it is calling linalgbackendbase
 OXPHOS	.dot
 OXPHOS	as i have tested
@lambday	OXPHOS: you must have forgotten to make it virtual
 OXPHOS	it is virtual..like:
 OXPHOS	    #define BACKEND_GENERIC_TO_GPU(Type) \ virtual GPUMemoryBase<Type>* to_gpu(SGVector<Type>) const \     {  \ SG_SWARNING("BASE BACKEND.\n") \ SG_SNOTIMPLEMENTED; \     }
@lambday	OXPHOS: that's to_gpu method, what about "dot" ?
 OXPHOS	i tried virtual GPUMemoryBase<Type>* to_gpu(SGVector<Type>) const=0
 OXPHOS	the same
@lambday	OXPHOS: let me check your patch
 OXPHOS	lambday: cool thx! https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3310
@lambday	OXPHOS: check.. I commented
@wiking	muccos
@wiking	lavida
@wiking	:)
@wiking	sorry OXPHOS yesterday i had an emergency thing
@wiking	so i had to go

 OXPHOS	wiking: it's okay. you can also shoot me an e-mail if I'm away
 OXPHOS	lambday: u think it's just because of the 'virtual' i'm missing..? but i tried to_gpu and from_gpu, they both failed too
@lambday	OXPHOS: can't be! :)
 OXPHOS	lambday: or is it because in the base macro the params are (SGVector) but in derived class they are (const SGVector&)?
@lambday	OXPHOS: add that virtual first, and then check - something must be missing
 OXPHOS	sure
@lambday	OXPHOS: of course!
@lambday	the overridden methods should have **the exact same** signature
@lambday	make both `const SGVector<T>&`
 OXPHOS	sure
@lambday	same goes for cv-qualifiers
 OXPHOS	lambday: IT WORKS

@lambday	bazdmeg: if you have a moment, can you please review this - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3305/files
@wiking	bazdmeg: new thing: baszom a szadat :)
@wiking	lambday: the uncalled review is there :)
@lambday	wiking: err what?
@wiking	lambday: in the pr :)
@lambday	wiking: hehe thanks.. checking
@wiking	nw
@lambday	wiking: btw EuclideanDistance now works with any CDotFeatures (earlier it only used to work with CDenseFeatures<float64_t>)
@lambday	which doesn't make any sense
@wiking	cool
@wiking	yeah we have many of these supershitty
@wiking	explicit casts
@lambday	wiking: yeah
@wiking	for no particular reasons
@lambday	totally loses the purpose of generics
@wiking	but then we have all the features templates
@wiking	go figure :)
@lambday	wiking: if I had time, I'd have fixed some of the sparse stuffs
@wiking	yeah that's another one :)
@lambday	maybe later
@lambday	we actually should not have sparse kernel at all.. the features and the distances should be able to handle different shits..
@lambday	then same gaussian kernel would work with sparse features as well as dense
@wiking	(nod)
@lambday	anyway
@wiking	if anyway then http://bazdmeg.github.io/
@wiking	:)
@lambday	hah
