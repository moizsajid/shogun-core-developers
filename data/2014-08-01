@besser82	HeikoS, G'Morning ^^  Back in London?
@HeikoS	besser82: hi, yes :)
@besser82	HeikoS, journey was good?
@besser82	You saw my email about the torrents?
@besser82	so if you want the 'raw'-stuff just go on and leech it  ;)
@besser82	HeikoS, ^^
@HeikoS	besser82: hey
@HeikoS	besser82: ok will do, just one file, i wondered about the sound
@besser82	HeikoS, allrighty... ^^
@HeikoS	besser82: sorry for delayed response
@besser82	HeikoS, np ^^ in Trasmission you can choose the file from the torrent you want to load, then ^^
@besser82	HeikoS, take the raw-video thing then...
@HeikoS	besser82: ok thanks, checking
@besser82	HeikoS, np yw ^^
@HeikoS	besser82: downloading
@HeikoS	besser82: thanks so much for putting the videos up so promtly, amazing!
@besser82	HeikoS, many thanks!!! =)
@besser82	HeikoS, I can see no torrent connection from you, yet...
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	i might not be allowed to torrent at work
@besser82	ic
@besser82	so just start downloading somewhere you are allowed to; I'll keep seeding...

@besser82	I'm currently creating new chroots for fc21, fc_rawhide and CentOS7.
@besser82	Will upload them in a few minutes, so you can get them running on fatbot.  Links are following...
@besser82	wiking, ^^
@besser82	wiking, upload is running... you can fetch them from here:  https://besser82.fedorapeople.org/chroots/

 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
@HeikoS	lambday:  hi
 lambday	HeikoS: I was checking the approach you suggested - one issue is.. we are not computing trace(inv(...)) but trace(A*inv(B)*C*inv(D)) sort of thing...
 lambday	the code I pasted computes this A*inv(B) without storing inv(B)
 lambday	and then for trace we can use the trick you mentioned
@HeikoS	lambday: ok then
@HeikoS	lambday: just wanted to make sure we never store the inv :)
 lambday	HeikoS: just out of curiosity - what's so bad about storing the inverse? except the extra memory requirement
@HeikoS	lambday: its unstable to do this
@HeikoS	lambday: might easily explode
@HeikoS	lambday: and one gets lots of rounding errors
 lambday	HeikoS: okay
@HeikoS	lambday: matlab these days even gives a warning when one does inv(A)*x
@HeikoS	and tell you to do "\" operator
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
 lambday	HeikoS: so do you think this approach is okay? https://gist.github.com/lambday/66e637b46109e132181d#file-inverse_benchmark-cpp-L74
@HeikoS	lambday: for matrices that are a bit largetr and a bit less good conditioned, things fall apart very quickly
@HeikoS	lambday: solving the matrix times identity vector thing?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah thats better, but even better would to avoid all this business at all and do svd maybe
 lambday	HeikoS: yes... and then using the soln vectors to compute matrix multiplication using dot on the fly
 lambday	we already have dot in linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah but thats also unstable
 lambday	so that's good
@HeikoS	lambday: so if we have A*inv(B)*C*inv(D)
@HeikoS	lambday: that can be computed and stored
 lambday	HeikoS: the whole thing? we actually need the trace of this
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah sorry
@HeikoS	lambday: too many things going on at once ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: no i think your approach is fine then
@HeikoS	lambday: should be ok
 lambday	HeikoS: hehe.. okay let me know when you're free
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe test it a bit
@HeikoS	lambday: free now, thats fine, just giving excuses why i dont know things exactly
@HeikoS	so yeah, do this one,
@HeikoS	with the dot in linalg, that is axtually great
@HeikoS	lambday: the loop should be in poarallel
@HeikoS	is the chol.solve thread safe?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that too I did in this code... gained a slight improvement
@HeikoS	cool
 lambday	oh that... umm not sure
 lambday	I was talking about computing a whole bunch of dots in parallel
@HeikoS	lambday: ok that is also fine
@HeikoS	lambday: i mean you can move the system solve inside there (more expensive than dot in fact)
@HeikoS	so a few (chol.solve, dot-product) things run in parallel
@HeikoS	lambday: just saw you have an omp pragma there
@HeikoS	lambday: does this work if you move it up a line?
 lambday	so inside each thread - solve one system for each col of identity matrix and then compute dots
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact
@HeikoS	lambday: its good as it is
@HeikoS	lambday: so keep it :)
@HeikoS	lambday: i gotta go to a talk now, let me know how things go
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
@HeikoS	lambday: very nice that you investigated this properly!
 lambday	HeikoS: as of now I'm just using eigen3 cholesky and dot - will change it when linalg is there in develop

@lisitsyn	iglesiasg hey :)

 iglesiasg_	lisitsyn: hello hello
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg_: share your experience on the workshop ;)
@lisitsyn	is there anything new going on?
@lisitsyn	I feel lost :)
 iglesiasg_	it was pretty cool :-)
-!- iglesiasg_ is now known as iglesiasg
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: why do you feel lost?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well I have no idea what you guys discussed there :)
@lisitsyn	so I am a bit out of the process
 iglesiasg	apart from the stuff of the videos
 iglesiasg	we discussed a bit on the mentor summit
 iglesiasg	I must buy by plane tickets asap btw
@lisitsyn	didn't you yet?
 iglesiasg	well, no
 iglesiasg	it is more than two and a half months left
 iglesiasg	but yes, I must do it soon anyway
@lisitsyn	ha true
@lisitsyn	I just thought they are messing with these returns already
@lisitsyn	POs whatever
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I am curious whether anything about kaggle is still of interest for any of us
@lisitsyn	it died immediately :D
 iglesiasg	lisitsyn: we didn't bring up that topic in fact
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I see
