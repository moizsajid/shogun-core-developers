 blackburn	(01:30:43 AM) sonney2k: blackburn, btw how can you be sure that elections were manipulated and not that you are being manipulated to believe they were? -- believe me they were ;) we have a lot of evidences of dirty cheating
 blackburn	hmm three guys wanting to work on shogun the same time?
 Ram108	lol
 ishaanmlhtr	Ya..I wanted to start working on shogun. Can work on its interface with matlab or python. Any of the two.
 Ram108	same here :) matlab cpp or python
 Ram108	:)
 Ram108	wen i run any of those py files all i get is the name of the algorithm
 Ram108	do i have to create the data set myself?
 Ram108	or is there any documentation?
 blackburn	Ram108: yes, it means all is ok
 blackburn	ishaanmlhtr: what is the field you are interested in?
 Ram108	ah but i really want to see it segregate something into groups
 Ram108	lol
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : I haven't done much in machine learning but want to start off . I have full two months free ahead of me.
 blackburn	guys do you know each other?
 blackburn	:D
 Ram108	oh no not really
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn: right now i was just going through the abstracts of shogun
 ishaanmlhtr	no,i dont know Ram108 at all
 blackburn	that's crazy.. ok
 Ram108	hi ishaan :)
 ishaanmlhtr	hi Ram108
 ishaanmlhtr	:)
 Ram108	call me ram :)
 ishaanmlhtr	ok sure
 blackburn	we have no one wanting to work on shogun anyhow for a while
 blackburn	and now three :D
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : ok,so could you help me get started with some aim
 blackburn	sure I'll try
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn: thats cool ,right?
 blackburn	yes, kind of cool
 Ram108	yeah i guess :P
 Ram108	so can we get started out with something..... perhaps a small task maybe?
 Ram108	am asking....
 blackburn	hmm ok :)
 Ram108	:)
 Ram108	well? who is the third guy?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal is
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 Ram108	rrenaud?
 blackburn	rrenaud was asking some things about VW
 blackburn	not a volkswagen but vowpal wabbit
 Ram108	hmmm
 blackburn	:D
 Ram108	lol yeah i know.... i did ask if u implemented that yesterday
 blackburn	ok what is the interface you want to work with? I suggest python for sure
 Ram108	yeah python is fine :)
 ishaanmlhtr	blackburn : first of all i wanted to have an experience working with shogun,so i was thinking of going through the tuts..would that be helpful?
 ishaanmlhtr	and yeah python is fine for me too.
 blackburn	so you want to learn some basics right?
 Ram108	yep
 ishaanmlhtr	yes
 blackburn	ok I could give you some dataset and suggest you to try different classifiers on these data
 Ram108	okay :)
 blackburn	you know basics of ML, like trainset/testset, etc?
 ishaanmlhtr	hmm..alright..
 ishaanmlhtr	ya,sort of..i could study more if need be
 Ram108	i could study too
 blackburn	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
 blackburn	lets try on this data
 Ram108	hmmm okay
 blackburn	let me describe a little
 blackburn	you have to read each row as a vector
 blackburn	and store it in numpy matrix column wise
 Ram108	k
 Ram108	hmmm
 blackburn	matrix [vector1 vector2 ...] is called a feature matrix
 Ram108	yes
 blackburn	meanwhile you have to construct labels vector
 Ram108	labels vector ..... hmmm
 ishaanmlhtr	ok..
 blackburn	i-th label is an 'answer' on i-th vector
 blackburn	we do not support complex labels like 'Iris-virginica'
 blackburn	but 0, 1, 2..
 Ram108	oh
 Ram108	hmmmm
 blackburn	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.names that's description
 blackburn	take a look on examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_knn_modular.py
 blackburn	when you have feature matrix for the train set
 blackburn	and for the test set
 blackburn	you have to create RealFeatures() shogun object
 Ram108	hmmm okay
 ishaanmlhtr	alright.
 blackburn	in case of kNN classifier distance is used
 Ram108	k
 blackburn	cause it is a distance-based classifier
 Ram108	hmmm
 blackburn	so just try read the data, separate train/test set somehow, create features, and train say LDA (or any other one) classifier
 ishaanmlhtr	ok..fine.,.
 blackburn	then try to apply it to test data and compare results
 Ram108	oh okay
 Ram108	what u gave us is the train..... we make up our own test right?
 blackburn	no
 Ram108	oops...
 Ram108	?
 blackburn	well just select a few for test
 blackburn	and separate
 Ram108	from the train itself.... hmmm okay
 blackburn	just cherry-pick say 5 each class
 Ram108	ok
 Ram108	each vector is a list right? say "vector1=[5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2]" and the total matrix is of the form "matrix=[vector1, vector 2, vector3......] did i get that correctly?
 blackburn	could be list but feature matrix should be numpy array
 blackburn	if vector1 = [1,2,3]
 blackburn	and vector2 = [4,5,6]
 blackburn	and vector3 = [7,8,9]
 blackburn	then feature matrix is
 blackburn	[[1,4,7],
 blackburn	 [2,5,8],
 blackburn	 [3,6,9]]
 blackburn	column-wise
 Ram108	oh got it
 blackburn	i.e. each column is a feature vector
 Ram108	i have a question...... vector1=[5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2,0], vector2=[4.4,2.9,1.4,0.2,0], vector3=[6.5,2.8,4.6,1.5,1]..... the feature matrix is[[5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2,0],[4.4,2.9,1.4,0.2,0],[6.5,2.8,4.6,1.5,1]] right?
 Ram108	where iris-setosa=0
 Ram108	Iris-versicolor=1
 Ram108	Iris-virginica=2
 Ram108	we form that for all the given data and form the test/ train by picking some from the given data......
 Ram108	am i correct?
 Ram108	hence the handpicked set of test or train vectors as numpy columns forms the feature set

-!- ishaanmlhtr [~chatzilla@14.98.12.160] has left #shogun []
 blackburn	Ram108: sorry was away
 blackburn	Ram108: no, your feature matrix is transposed, feature matrix is a matrix of dim rows and N columns
 blackburn	and vectors are stored by column
 blackburn	you are right about labels
 blackburn	0,1,2 will be enough

 Ram108	hi can i email u the code?
 blackburn	Ram108: sure
 Ram108	done :)
 Ram108	well i hope i have generated the feature matrix correctly......
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.242.7.139] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 Ram108	pls feel free to tell me any modifications necessary
 Ram108	now what do i have to do? how do i generate test vectors from it?
 blackburn	Ram108: you could do it in a more simple way
 blackburn	much more
 blackburn	f = open('yourdatafile')
 Ram108	oh u mean without using an intermediate file?
 blackburn	for line in f.readlines():
 blackburn	   dataline = line.split(',')
 blackburn	and then you will get a list of numbers and Iris-*
 Ram108	oh hmmm okay sure i ll get to it nw
 Ram108	by the way are these for classifying the flowers lol :P
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	:D
 Ram108	:)
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.242.82.82] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	Ram108: once you got matrix
 Ram108	yes?
 blackburn	btw you can create zero matrix with numpy.zeros([dim,N])
 blackburn	once you got this matrix you have to create RealFeatures(matrix)
 Ram108	oh hmmm thanks :)
 Ram108	hw do i do that?
 blackburn	and then it is the similar as in examples in shogun sources
 Ram108	how do i create real features?
 blackburn	Ram108: features = RealFeatures(matrix)
 blackburn	and 'from modshogun import *' before
 Ram108	oh hmmm thanks :)
 Ram108	okay :)
 blackburn	Ram108: it could be much shorter still but continue with creating features and training the classifier
 Ram108	yeah sure.....
 Ram108	why is my data in curly braces? lol i guess RealFeatures function did somethn to it
 blackburn	ehm?
 Ram108	now that i have the feature matrix what do i do :)
 blackburn	take a look on any classifier_* python example
 Ram108	lol nothn.... was just fooling arnd with the print statement after calling RealFeatures()
 Ram108	okay :)
 Ram108	i ll have to create "train data.dat, test data.dat, label_train_twoclass.dat" right?
 Ram108	am sorry am asking a lot of stupid questions..... :(
 blackburn	Ram108: no, you can use your files
 blackburn	Ram108: you need to create two RealFeatures instances
 blackburn	for train and test data
 blackburn	then create labels for train data
 blackburn	and create/train/etc classifier
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 Ram108	label_traindat = lm.load_labels('../data/label_train_twoclass.dat') whats that?
 Ram108	i ll have to write the feature matrix obtained after "features=RealFeatures(new_mat)" onto a file named train and test seperately right?
 Ram108	and what do u mean by create labels for train data?
 blackburn	Ram108: load_labels() loads labels from file, you do not have to use it,
 blackburn	Ram108: labels is vector of 'answers'
 blackburn	just set 0,1,2 to corresponding positions
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 Ram108	so i ll just neglect that
 Ram108	and create the test and train files by writing the "features" obtained onto a file and setting the path correct on classifier_*.py
 Ram108	am i correct?
-!- ishaanmlhtr [~chatzilla@14.98.155.181] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	Ram108: no you do not have to do it
 blackburn	Ram108: just read your data file into the matrix
 blackburn	and create RealFeatures(matrix)
 Ram108	u mean set the path?
 blackburn	no, just write your own with available example
-!- ishaanmlhtr [~chatzilla@14.98.155.181] has quit [Client Quit]
 Ram108	okay sorry am missing something here
 Ram108	well i ll have to first write the RealFeatures matrix onto two files as it is, right?
 blackburn	Ram108:
 blackburn	1) read real valued columns of your file into the numpy matrix, and for each ith vector store 0 for iris-setosa, 1 for iris-*, 2 for iris-* in the labels vector
 blackburn	2) create RealFeatures(matrix) and Labels(labels)
 blackburn	3) train classifier
 Ram108	oh okay
 blackburn	after step 1) you will have some matrix
 Ram108	yeah got it :)
 blackburn	[[x1, y1 ...],
 blackburn	 [x2, y2 ...],
 blackburn	 [x3, y3 ...]]
 blackburn	and labels
 Ram108	now i have 2 matrices RealFeature matrix and label matrix :)
 Ram108	yeah :)
 blackburn	yes
 Ram108	i have created the RealFeatures(matrix) and Labels(labels) instances
 Ram108	how do i link it with the classifier function?
 blackburn	for example lda = LDA(1.0, features, labels)
 Ram108	oh hmmm :)
 Ram108	yeah i did that....
 Ram108	then what?
 blackburn	lda.train()
 Ram108	i got that error
 blackburn	oh sure
 blackburn	LDA is two-class classifier
 Ram108	hmmm okay.....
 blackburn	well then try KNN
 Ram108	god i really need to catch up on a lot of theory...... i ll read it up..... which othr classifier wud u suggest
 Ram108	oh okay
 blackburn	just do it as in classifier_knn_modular.py
 Ram108	k
 Ram108	knn requires distance as a parameter.......
 blackburn	just create it
 Ram108	i did it threw up an error again :(
 Ram108	am sorry am really bugging u nw
 blackburn	copy-paste it here

 blackburn	yes, you should do it e.g. KNN(3,distance,labels)
 blackburn	not features
 Ram108	oh hmmm ok
 Ram108	well i guess u r kind of exhausted with this..... do u want me to meet u later?
 Ram108	am really sorry......
 blackburn	Ram108: not really, just trying to do two things in parallel ;)
 Ram108	:)
-!- puneetgoyal [~puneet@115.242.82.82] has quit [Ping timeout: 268 seconds]
 Ram108	how do i see the op? the last bit of implementation of the code is on the screenshot. hope i have done it correctly
 blackburn	you shouldnot include labels in features
 blackburn	use new_mat[:3,:]
 blackburn	and you should init distance with train,train to train
 Ram108	k
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 blackburn	well train does pretty nothing for KNN
 Ram108	oh gee! hmmm
 Ram108	well yeah i got a fair idea of how it works :)
 blackburn	you will catch everything, it will become pretty easy
 Ram108	hmmm sure hoping forward to see that day......
 Ram108	i guess i ll finish it off tomorrow
 Ram108	been a tiring day and am exhausted
 Ram108	goodbye :)
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	see you
 Ram108	thanks a lot for your help :) really appreciate it :)
 Ram108	c u tomorrow :)
 Ram108	bye :)

@sonney2k	blackburn, any news?
 blackburn	sonney2k: news on?
@sonney2k	any
 blackburn	ehmm
 blackburn	no idea :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: what kind of news do you want?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well we have THREE 'newcomers'
 blackburn	I'll try to take care on that :)
 blackburn	I did suggest to implement t-SNE technique to Eugeniy aka gsomix
 blackburn	and we are pretty near to release I guess
 puneetgoyal	hello, I am spending a little more time on studying various things about svm...about how its working and all
 puneetgoyal	is it ok? or I should concentrate more on implementing it?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: ehm, implementing what?
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: implementing svm, first to learn how it classifies the data and then will try to use it to detect spams
 blackburn	it would be pretty difficult to implement svm once again
 blackburn	and hey we have much already :D
 blackburn	just use it
 puneetgoyal	so I should use the one included in shogun as an objecty
 blackburn	that is pretty consistent to use implemented
 blackburn	cause implementing svm solver is a hard task
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, it will be enough work to prepare data, use the svm in shogun and later on to write some more optimized 'features'
@sonney2k	blackburn, nice that we have new interested students and great that you take care :)
 blackburn	sure
 puneetgoyal	sonney2k: I am sorry if I got it wrong, but wont the svm given in svm will map the data onto some specific features?...so It means I would edit the existing code to write some more optimized features?
 puneetgoyal	given in shogun*
@sonney2k	puneetgoyal, you will need to do this mapping at some point to get best results
 puneetgoyal	ok great, I would get back in a short while after implementing some using shogun's module
 shogun-buildbot	build #83 of nightly_all is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_all/builds/83
@sonney2k	for spam you can currently use the CommWordStringKernel - blackburn did show you an embedding recently - that is how it works :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, any plan on the release? any trac -> github migration started?
@sonney2k	My concern is that we are both very busy and w/o a plan won't make this release.
@sonney2k	So I could either just type make release now or we have to make a concrete plan
 blackburn	sonney2k: make release now
 blackburn	:)
 blackburn	if you have no really hard concerns about current status
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll continue with migrating issues soon
@sonney2k	blackburn, have you updated NEWS?
 blackburn	is it outdated? let me check
 blackburn	yes, updating
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r55984f5 / src/NEWS : Updated news - http://git.io/q1jo8A
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess we can start release?
 shogun-buildbot	build #370 of python_static is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/370  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
@sonney2k	too tired now will try to do sth hopefully tomorrow...
 blackburn	hah
