 sonne|work	HeikoS, wiking, lisitsyn - yesterday at a x-mas party: 4 people approaching me complaining that they failed to install/compile shogun ...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: haha
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: leading to the point where they considered implementing the algorithm instead of trying to install shogun...
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I have to admit when you were ruling us it was better :)
-!- shubhamgoyal [~shubhamgo@118.189.209.93] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: nah I am a bad dictator - you are a democracy now :D
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: you see it doesn't work
@lisitsyn	that's why we have putin hahaha
@HeikoS	sonne|work: I know that happens all the time to me
 sonne|work	HeikoS: has no one time to fix it?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: what are your ideas for that?
@HeikoS	sonne|work: well fix....things DO work its just there are too many place where things can fail
@HeikoS	sonne|work: which we cannot controll
 sonne|work	complaint #1: I cannot find a binary (.deb for ubuntu)
@HeikoS	sonne|work: so I want to push binary packages
@HeikoS	yeah exactly
@HeikoS	sonne|work: we do have a ppa for latest ubuntu
 sonne|work	complaint #2: OK so I tried to install from source (probably 80% of the users lost by now)
 sonne|work	and I could not find documentation
 sonne|work	well I found documentation but it was outdated and not working
 sonne|work	so I tried myself
@HeikoS	sonne|work: yeah all good points, we have to make this more visible
 sonne|work	outdated version of cmake in ubuntu
 sonne|work	so tried to even upgrade ubuntu
@HeikoS	yeah old ubuntu's cmale has a bug
 sonne|work	... or does this work on my mac?
 sonne|work	errm ... failed on mac in the meantime too
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: that's the thing we were working on actually :D
@lisitsyn	just yesterday
 sonne|work	I mean complaints from sys admins, and users for python and matlab
@HeikoS	sonne|work: its the aim for this years gsoc, fixing these things
@HeikoS	we think to actually feature freeze, not implement more than 1 or 2 new algos, and work on those issues instead
@HeikoS	sonne|work: good to hear from you btw
