 gsomix	besser82, huh, you too, again. :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, how is life?
 besser82	gsomix: don't mind;  it's the rest of blood inside my alcoholics  :-P
 gsomix	sonney2k, nice. preparing to exams. have installed Debian, trying to build fresh shogun
@sonney2k	gsomix, do it - we want to release 3.1 *very* soon...
 gsomix	besser82, huh. unfortunately I have not met ded moroz at this days :(
@sonney2k	gsomix, and I guess you know you still owe us .mat file support any chance to see you working on that in the near future?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yeah, I remember. I want to try implement it at this ny holidays.
 gsomix	sonney2k, btw, do you use debian stable? are there any repos with fresh gcc? I already found llvm/clang repo.
@sonney2k	gsomix, yes I use debian stable
 besser82	gsomix:  If you want to try:  Fedora 20 features all your needs  ;)  And ships recent shogun build in it's repos  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, :P
 besser82	sonney2k:  just some Ambassador stuff, you know ;)
 gsomix	besser82, ah, I'm so used to deb-based distros... I've already tried Fedora 20 with mate at liveCD. looks nice.
 besser82	gsomix:  Yes, me buddy raveit65 has spent a lot of work for that MATE stuff ;)
 besser82	gsomix:  he actually maintains most of MATE in Fedora
 besser82	gsomix:  If you feel more comfortable with debian just stay  ;)
 besser82	gsomix:  It was just a suggestion, because of ready2use shogun  ;)
@sonney2k	gsomix, btw did you notice that protobuf stuff now works?
 gsomix	sonney2k, nope.
@sonney2k	gsomix, well it does :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, cool. have already installed libprotobuf-dev. compiling...

 lambday	sonney2k: btw I was talking briefly with Heiko over email the other day.. and the unified multicore/distributed computing interface would be great to have I guess
 lambday	I am up for it.. currently making myself familiar with concepts etc
 lambday	sonney2k: by the way I got a job placement at oracle :)
@sonney2k	lambday, indeed that would be nice
@sonney2k	lambday, we should think big and try to run things also in {google,amazon,ms}cloud
@sonney2k	lambday, congrats
 lambday	sonney2k: alright....
 lambday	thanks :)
 lambday	sonney2k: I am new at this... will have to learn a lot
@sonney2k	lambday, IMHO most important for shogun at this stage is doing lots of notebooks / demos
 lambday	okay
@sonney2k	and to smoothen the user experience - as in what besser82 is doing (new cmake scripts)
@sonney2k	and so to get it into distributions (again)
@sonney2k	lambday, so if you have some time feel free to write a notebook about some beloved algorithm :)
 lambday	ah that sounds great!
 lambday	yeah Heiko told me about multitask learning notebook..  I will start with that
@sonney2k	lambday, you should ask lisitsyn and have a look at the tutorial were lisitsyn wrote down some formulas
 lambday	sonney2k: alright... yeah I have that...
@sonney2k	but it is oooold code and I doubt we have tests for that
 lambday	okay.. then tests too! check!
@sonney2k	lambday, that would be cool... but ask HeikoS :) he as you ex-mentor is probably the best guide
 lambday	sonney2k: okay.. ya he said he will be fully back after his exams.. meanwhile I am checking stufffs
@sonney2k	lambday, yeah - just ask on the channel then
@sonney2k	alrighty
* sonney2k is off getting kids out of bed
 lambday	okay :)
 lambday	haha :D

@sonney2k	I mean fast as in faster than what we have? I am tempted to replace ours by http://www.mloss.org/software/view/48/
@sonney2k	which is a nice c library with easy to use interface and uses at least triangle inequalities to speed it up
