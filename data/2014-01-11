 bb_	hi besser82 how have you been
 besser82	bb_:  fine thanks!  And yourself?
 bb_	doing well... how was your new year
 bb_	i got the latest shogun from the git and the python examples give a segmentation fault
 bb_	besser82 do you have any idea on this
 besser82	bb_:  idea on what?
 bb_	about the seg fault
 besser82	bb_:  on which os?
 besser82	bb_:  my new year started fine, btw;  how bout yours?
 besser82	bb_:  sry, didn't read the backlog....
 bb_	besser82 osx .. previusly it was working fine
 bb_	besser82 but i wanted to get the latest one and now i get this problem
 besser82	bb_:  on stuff related to osx, I actually have no ideas...  can you please run the example using valgrind?
 bb_	besser82 i am not able to run any of the examples in python_modular
 bb_	besser82 i deleted the older version of shogun may be i should go back to that
 besser82	bb_:  then try to run `valgrind --track-origins  python $shogun_example.py`, plz and paste me it's output somewhere
 besser82	bb_:  maybe that can give me some conclusion....
 besser82	bb_:  you may have to install valgrind first using "brew"
 bb_	besser82 sure let me get valgrind and then try it doing it now
 besser82	bb_:  thanks!  that might give me some sure hints whats going wrong for u
 bb_	besser82 is there any other program similar to valgrind i can use .. valgrind is not supported for osx 10.9 they support only till 10.8
 besser82	bb_:  there might be gdb, but that is quite harder to use...
 besser82	bb_:  maybe OSX itself ships sth like valgrind, i dunno...
 besser82	bb_:  maybe wiking knows....
 besser82	wiking:  ^^^ ping?
 bb_	besser82 but what has changed from last time that it is seg faulting... i had a relatively new version
 bb_	besser82 of shogun which i was happy with ...
 besser82	bb_:  I dunno... maybe you compiled against the wrong python-libs?!?
 besser82	bb_:  which would cause the segfaults when using a different py-interp...
@wiking	besser82: pong
 besser82	wiking:  is there sth. like "valgrind" for OSX 10.9?
@wiking	besser82: dtrace
@wiking	besser82: what's the problem
 besser82	wiking:  bb_ has problems with segfaulting python_modular  :(
@wiking	bb_: can u send the output of your cmake somewhere?
 bb_	wiking i am getting segfault after everyting compiles in the latest shogun
@wiking	bb_: when trying to use the interface or when compiling?
 besser82	bb_:  does the libshogun it self segfault? did you try that?
@wiking	besser82: for segfault it's better to use gdb/lldb
 besser82	wiking:  yes, but that is quite harder for someone without debug-expirience...
@wiking	bb_: i suppose the interpreter and lib does not match. u have macports right?
 besser82	wiking:  valgrind atleast gives some useful hints what's wrong in a quite simple way ;)
 bb_	wiking yes i have macports .. when i am trying to run the the example in pythong modular
@wiking	bb_: i think what's happening maybe is that cmake detects your system's python but it tries to use the macports' python lib. or the other way around. i had those segfaults in this scenario
@wiking	bb_: plz try to pastebin the output of your cmake
@wiking	although i must say that i haven't tried to compile/use python modular lately on osx
@wiking	so maaaaaybe there's another reason
@wiking	this is my first guess
 bb_	wiking here is the output for cmake http://pastebin.com/gjUZ3qRn
 bb_	wiking it was working fine all these days with the older version of shogun and i decided to get the lastest one
@wiking	mmm seems it's using system's python
 bb_	wiking yes it was doing the same when it was working perfectly
@wiking	bb_: do u use system's python interpreter or macports for running the example
@wiking	i.e. what's the output of this: port select python
 bb_	wiking systems python interpreter
@wiking	mmmm
@wiking	then i guess we have a bug
 bb_	| => port select python Available versions for python: none (active) python25-apple python26-apple python27 python27-apple
@wiking	looking at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/waterfall
@wiking	does not surprise me
@wiking	btw what is the example u try to run?
 bb_	svm.py in graphical in undocumented python modular
 bb_	wiking how can we work around this
@wiking	dunno
 bb_	wiking should i just revert back to the old one.. is there a way to get old version from git
@wiking	bb_: yes
@wiking	git checkout <commit version that worked for you>
 bb_	wiking there is no way for me to know that..
@wiking	life is cruel
@wiking	oh man it's just a pain to see this shit protobuf cmake
 bb_	wiking i am stuck here not sure which shogun i had earlier..
 bb_	wiking let me know if you can think of a workaround or need something from with dtrace or will try to install valgrind

@iglesiasg	hey guys
@iglesiasg	about the Google docs
@iglesiasg	do you happen to know who Christian Dersch is?
@iglesiasg	I got a mail asking for permission to join the doc
 besser82	iglesiasg:  yes, he is one me buddies
@iglesiasg	besser82, all right, I will add him as a viewer
 besser82	iglesiasg:  BSc astro-physics, currently doing MSc
 besser82	iglesiasg:  just did so  ;)
 besser82	iglesiasg:  He possibly wants to mentor sth. like openCV intergration or that Markov stuffs
 besser82	iglesiasg:  thanks for asking!  :D
@iglesiasg	no problem at all :)

 pickle27	sonney2k: looking at the website now, I see what you mean about the db, anyway you could dump the production database into sqlite3 and send me the file?
 pickle27	or how do you usually work on the site? just live...?

@sonney2k	pickle27, no that is the problem - I can dump the mysql db but no idea how to get that into sqlite format
@sonney2k	pickle27, btw want to mentor this year?

 pickle27	sonney2k: I would love too!
 pickle27	hmm can you send me the mysql dump? I'll try and figure it out
@sonney2k	pickle27, what would you want to mentor?
@sonney2k	pickle27, opencv integration?
 pickle27	sure I could do that although I don't know if that scope is big enough for GSOC
 pickle27	maybe integration plus some awesome examples
@sonney2k	pickle27, yes sounds cool
@sonney2k	pickle27, what is your google mail addr?
@sonney2k	I give you write acces to the doc
 pickle27	kevinhughes27@gmail.com
 pickle27	sorry which doc?
 pickle27	nvm
@sonney2k	pickle27, ok sent you the dump
@sonney2k	pickle27, if you figure sth out would be nice
 pickle27	sonney2k: okay I'll see what I can with it
@sonney2k	pickle27, and please add your idea / yourself as mentors in the google doc
 pickle27	I will!
 pickle27	also how tied are we to django for the site?
 pickle27	flask might be simpler
 pickle27	I'll probably stick with django but just thought I'd see what you thought
@sonney2k	pickle27, lets just stick with django
 pickle27	sounds good
@sonney2k	pickle27, in principle we don't need the extensive stuff we have now in django but that is the way it is and at least people can admin the website w/o editing the code
 pickle27	true
 pickle27	sonney2k: look what I found: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Workshop2/Assignments/Baseball/instructions.html
 pickle27	seems to work
@sonney2k	pickle27, *lol*
@sonney2k	pickle27, but cool!
@sonney2k	pickle27, just make sure you never expose the real db with user names etc in some PR or so
 pickle27	good point
@sonney2k	pickle27, the convert almost works...
@sonney2k	pickle27, I have some weird \r in the output
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.176.242] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 pickle27	seemed to work for me
 pickle27	when I load the shogun page I get all the tabs and stuff now
 pickle27	which is really all I needed
 pickle27	ah I see what you mean
 pickle27	I'll try and fix the script
@sonney2k	pickle27, keep me posted - it is still much better with this script than w/o anything :D
 pickle27	yeah this way you can play around locally at least
