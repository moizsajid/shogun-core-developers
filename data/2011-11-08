 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: supernaught
-!- Netsplit over, joins: supernaught
 blackburn	sonney2k: so are you around? :)
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	whats up
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would like to suggest users
 blackburn	to use issues
 blackburn	I love it much more than trac
 blackburn	I guess you too?
@sonney2k	I am currently working with some octave developer to fix the 'doesn't compile w/ clang' stuff
@sonney2k	I am fine with trac
@sonney2k	I dont' really care though
 blackburn	sonney2k: so ok if I suggest it?
@sonney2k	I prefer emails on the mailinglist instead of issues
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about email, then issue
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	experience tells if we don't manage to address the problems within a week we will never address them
 blackburn	sonney2k: issues are much more convenient to track progress on bug..
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes if you have hundreds of them and many developers
 blackburn	uh okay
@sonney2k	but up to you - if it helps you fixing bugs :)
 blackburn	I'll think about it a little more
 blackburn	will send letter tomorrow if I would like to suggest it
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen trees issue?
 blackburn	I would like to find new developer for that
@sonney2k	blackburn, so you want to do c5.0 ?
@sonney2k	would be cool
 blackburn	I want to do unified framework
@sonney2k	ohh
 blackburn	for trees
@sonney2k	like id3 port c4.5 from weka etc?
 blackburn	I don't know yet but I think it is possible
 blackburn	some TreeMachine?
 blackburn	I think it can be done with efficient code re-use
 blackburn	so developer just should determine how to construct tree
 blackburn	sonney2k: don't you think so?
 blackburn	I think we need C5.0, ID3 and Random Forest
@sonney2k	I am not a tree expert - it might be difficult to do very general tree stuff
@sonney2k	but I would love to have them :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: me not a expert in anything but I think that's possible
 blackburn	oh I mixed me neither and I'm not
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	too late, have to sleep now
 blackburn	sonney2k: see you
@sonney2k	yeah right
@sonney2k	will need to sleep too
 blackburn	good night
@sonney2k	cu
