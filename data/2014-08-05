 sonne|work	wiking: so did you have time to fiddle with the hedonismbot?
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah it's up and running
@wiking	sonne|work: i still have to move some tasks from fatbot
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah makes sense to move all compile stuff over
@wiking	but i've already added the a new trusty job + opencl tests
 sonne|work	wiking: nice!
@wiking	sonne|work: only thing is missing actually to move the basic libshogun + modular and static test to hedonism
@wiking	all the buildbot related chroots are moved to hedonisms
 sonne|work	wiking: so sounds like you did almost all the work already

 Guest14866	Hi, I am just trying to save and load files in python by the SHOGUN SVM with save_serializable and load_serializable but this is freaking slow and I think I am just misusing it for my requirement. Can you tell me how to do it in a proper way?
@besser82	wiking, ping?

@wiking	pong
 Guest14866	I have already tried the wrapped method bool save (FILE *svm_file) but I don't know which file descriptor I have to pass to this method
@wiking	besser82: pong
 Guest14866	... via python!
@wiking	Guest14866: what SerializableFile type are u using?
 Guest14866	Neither Ascii nor Binary does work
@wiking	binary?
@wiking	what binary r u trying?
@wiking	mm Guest14866 ok can u actually paste how do you try to serialize SVM?
@wiking	just paste the snippet of the code to pastebin.com
@besser82	wiking, can you give me a user-acc for sg-hp on django, plz?
@wiking	besser82: mmmm
@wiking	lemme see if i can
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS cannot... So you, Fernando and S?ren are left  ;)
@wiking	besser82: gimme pub key
 Guest14866	The problem is, save_serializable gives us a file, but the save(..) routine of MulticlassLibSVM has been wrapped to accept FILE* as its first argument. How does one specify a C FILE pedant in python? Or is a wrapper for this function not available?
@besser82	wiking, query ^^
@wiking	Guest14866: have u checked this example actually: examples/undocumented/python_modular/serialization_complex_example.py
@wiking	ok
@wiking	besser82: you should be able to update now the site
@besser82	wiking, many thx ^^
@wiking	besser82: simply run 'make release' in shogun-web directory
@besser82	wiking, can you give me push acc to that repo as well, plz?!?
@wiking	besser82: u dont have?
@wiking	k
@wiking	just a sec
@besser82	wiking, nope, not yet...  only sg && sg-data...
@wiking	besser82: done added
@besser82	wiking, many thanks ^^  just got mail ^^
 Guest14866	@wiking: Yes, thank you for the link but I already tried this examples but each of it is very slow and so I guessed that there is another way to do it?
@wiking	Guest14866: mmm how big is your training set?
 Guest14866	@wiking: 400 examples and each feature vector has a length of 3000
@wiking	Guest14866: what you could try to speed up the serialization of the svm
@wiking	to clear it's features
@wiking	r u using kernels?
 Guest14866	does is suffice to save the kernel only?
@wiking	so you r using MulticlassLibSVM with a kernel?
 Guest14866	@wiking: linear kernel
 Guest14866	yes
@wiking	linear kernel?
@wiking	why dont u use then liblinear?
 Guest14866	we have already tried different configurations
@wiking	ah i see
@wiking	no worries
@wiking	well
@wiking	how slow is slow?
@wiking	could you save it at least
@wiking	or not at all?
 Guest14866	it takes longer than to train it :)
@wiking	and how big was the serialized file if u managed to save it
@wiking	jesus
 Guest14866	you see.. :)
@wiking	but have u managed it on the end
@wiking	or not ?
 Guest14866	yes
 Guest14866	but it was very huge, the filesize was ... just a moment
@wiking	ok
 Guest14866	280 mb
@wiking	Guest14866: do u still have the file?
 Guest14866	yes
@wiking	can u share it?
 Guest14866	yes, but it will take some time to upload :)
@wiking	i can wait :)
@wiking	Guest14866: but please send me a reminding to wiking@maeth.com
@wiking	as i'm going to go to sleep soonish
 Guest14866	sure, thanks a lot!
@wiking	nw

 sonney2k_	wiking, ceral smells like serious code bloat and looks exactly like the boost stuff (which did increase compile time and code size by like factor 10)
@besser82	sonney2k_, nope ^^
@besser82	sonney2k_, compile time with cereal is actually pretty fast
@besser82	sonney2k_, and from code pov it is even real simple stuff and not even comparable to boost-serialize
@wiking	sonney2k_: it's header only lib... not like boost
@wiking	sonney2k_: we have to change serialization/parameter fw as the current one is unmaintainable...
@wiking	sonney2k_: https://github.com/thekvs/cpp-serializers
