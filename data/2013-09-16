 wiking	i wonder what is the equivalent of FILE* in python
@iglesiasg	yep
 wiking	iglesiasg: maybe you need to implement
 wiking	CSVFile(int fd)
 wiking	ctor
 wiking	and that'll solve your problem
@iglesiasg	gsomix, what do you think? ^
 wiking	yeah i think that's the problem
 wiking	that u need a file descriptor ctor
 wiking	and not a FILE*
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I'm ok with it.
 wiking	for this
 wiking	iglesiasg: just create such a ctor
 wiking	and just convert fd -> FILE*
 wiking	in the ctor
 wiking	( FILE *
 wiking	     fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);
 wiking	^ is the standard c funct for this
@iglesiasg	wiking, and from python the int fd will be the output from gzip.open, right?
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	hope so
@iglesiasg	isn't it a bit weird since then the file would be like opened twice?
 wiking	why?
 wiking	no
 wiking	you are passing an FD
@iglesiasg	gzip.open
@iglesiasg	and then in the constructor
 wiking	and?
@iglesiasg	open(fd)
 wiking	no
 wiking	in ctor you open an fd
 wiking	i mean you pass an fd
 wiking	hence it's open
@iglesiasg	all right
 wiking	you just ready from the fd starting from that moment in CSVFile
 wiking	u just need
 wiking	fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);
 wiking	to convert from fd -> FILE*
 wiking	as CSVFile is writter for using FILE*
 gsomix	hm, are you sure that gzip.open returns fd?
 wiking	gsomix: most probably....
 gsomix	>> This is a shorthand for GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel).
 gsomix	>> class gzip.GzipFile([filename[, mode[, compresslevel[, fileobj[, mtime]]]]])
 gsomix	but class GzipFile class have  def fileno(self): method.
* gsomix hates python's doc
@iglesiasg	gsomix, any hack required to make a CSVFile constructor visible from interfaces?
@iglesiasg	I just compiled and installed and the same error persists
@iglesiasg	but in the list of CSVFile constructors printed in the error the CSVFile(int) constructor I created does not appear
@iglesiasg	all right, cleaning and re-compiling...
 gsomix	iglesiasg, I'd like to help, but... z-z-z
@iglesiasg	gsomix, no worries
 gsomix	nite
 gsomix	iglesiasg, so if ctor works you can use fileno method of GzipFile for getting fd
@iglesiasg	gsomix, nice, thanks!
@iglesiasg	that can be indeed useful
 wiking	lol
 wiking	gta v is out
 wiking	:d
@iglesiasg	good bye guys, see you in three months again :P
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	:D

@iglesiasg	wiking, one of my friends got a ps3 a couple of days ago for this lol
@iglesiasg	wiking, btw it seems that gzip.open doesn't return an int
@iglesiasg	or a fd for that matter
 wiking	00:22 < gsomix> iglesiasg, so if ctor works you can use fileno method of GzipFile for getting fd
@iglesiasg	wiking, bah it didn't work for some reason
 wiking	?
@iglesiasg	wiking, I can call the constructor with CSVFile(gzipfile.fileno())
 wiking	how so?
@iglesiasg	but the features object has 0 features and vectors
 wiking	mmm iglesiasg test then first the ctor
 wiking	i.e. write a small c++ code
@iglesiasg	wiking, this is the constructor
@iglesiasg	+CCSVFile::CCSVFile(int fd) :
@iglesiasg	+       CFile(fdopen(fd, "r"), NULL)
@iglesiasg	+{
@iglesiasg	+       init();
 wiking	that open a csv file with int fd = open('filename', 'r')
@iglesiasg	+       init_with_defaults();
@iglesiasg	+}
@iglesiasg	I might have very well screwed
 wiking	and then pass that fd to the new ctor
@iglesiasg	just looked up what the other constructors do
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	CFile(fdopen(fd, "r"), NULL) -> CFile(fdopen(fd, rw), name)
 wiking	and he ctor shouuld be
@iglesiasg	wiking, rw is "rw"?
@iglesiasg	I just didn't add the arguments for name and permissions at first
 wiking	CSVFile(int fd, const char* name)
 wiking	CSVFile(int fd, char rw, const char* name)
 wiking	..
 wiking	but yeah
 wiking	other than that that should work
 wiking	The mode of the stream must be compatible with the mode of the file descriptor.
 wiking	maybe it has different modes?
 wiking	u should really first test this ctor from c++ code
@iglesiasg	wiking, how do you suggest me to try it?
 wiking	00:54 < wiking> that open a csv file with int fd = open('filename', 'r')
@iglesiasg	wiking, all right, let's do that
@iglesiasg	sorry for making you repeat stuff :S
@iglesiasg	 wiking, so I think the problem is that opening the file with gzip is not doing anything about uncompressing it
@iglesiasg	the gzip.GzipFile.read() method does it
@iglesiasg	but if we just open it and give it to CSVFile, then it is not uncompressed

 sonne|work	wiking: awake?
 wiking	yep yep
 wiking	what'sup
 sonne|work	wiking: could you enable running examples and tests for the static interfaces?
 sonne|work	wiking: you currently enabled for cmdline only
 wiking	hahah
 sonne|work	and no tests
 wiking	it's not about enabling them
 wiking	it's about implementing them..
 wiking	and that's more time
 sonne|work	errm what changed?
 wiking	nothing but it was never implemented
 sonne|work	I mean how do you run *_modular examples?
 wiking	it has nothing to do with it
 wiking	i mean cmake needs to be created
 wiking	the files that actually will run the examples
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	so I guess later then :/
 sonne|work	wiking: and what did you find out about the R dispatcher?
 sonne|work	wiking: not sure if you have seen but we now have only 2 examples failing
 sonne|work	and it seems like real bugs / memory corruption
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: is thursday 18:00 ok for you?
 lisitsyn	(meeting)
 sonne|work	timezone?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: your
 sonne|work	no time
 lisitsyn	http://doodle.com/4ctd4cwr588nwe52
 lisitsyn	I am having hard time with that doodle
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: do you see anything that fits your timespans?

 sonne|work	besser82: I didn't change a thing though, please paste the generated src/shogun/lib/versionstring.h
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: looking
 wiking	sonne|work: yeah i'll do the things...
 wiking	sonne|work: but now i'm working on something else :)
 wiking	for the first time
 sonne|work	wiking: what did you find out about R?
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: times are in UTC?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: berlin tz
 lisitsyn	hmm
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: argh
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: so when I click 11PM then it is local time right?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: at the top of the table
 sonne|work	?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: there is timezone thing
 sonne|work	yes it says berlin
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: yeah then what you see is berlin tz
 besser82	sonne|work: here you go: http://ur1.ca/fk9m5
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: because it shows me moscow tz for a reason :D
 sonne|work	besser82: #define VERSION_REVISION 0x3.0.0
 sonne|work	so yes indeed wrong
 besser82	sonne|work: how should it be supposed to look like? 3.0.0?
 sonne|work	I guess I will have to strip the dots and fill in some 0's
 sonne|work	maybe 0x300000
 besser82	sonne|work: looks better, meanwhile I'll use some sed-magic on it....
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: ok filled in
 besser82	sonne|work: sed-magick doesn't work file get's regenerated on `make`
 sonne|work	besser82: sure I will fix it relax
 besser82	sonne|work: thanks  :)
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: ohh the best case is w/o pickle27 lambday hushell patrick and fernando

 sonne|work	besser82: any idea how to generate a regexp that adds a trailing 0 ? Or some cmake way to do the job 1 -> 01 ?
 besser82	sonne|work: you are talking about PREpending a "0"?
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah that is what I meant
 besser82	sonne|work: SET (var "0${var}")  should do :)
 sonne|work	besser82: well but var needs to be 0...9 then
 besser82	sonne|work: or you can SET(var "0") ....  SET( var "${var}${new-value}")  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: if you need some more elaborated way, please point me to the code/script in question
 sonne|work	besser82: well version.cmake in cmake dir
 sonne|work	besser82: I am extracting a VERSION_MAJOR / MINOR now
 sonne|work	for getting the
 sonne|work	0x030000
 sonne|work	I need to prepend a 0 if the MAJOR/MINOR is <10

@HeikoS	lambday: hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 lambday	hehe I pinged at the same time
@HeikoS	just checked your PR, still building in travis
@HeikoS	haha :)
 lambday	HeikoS: with 10 log-det samples, I get pretty good accuracy
@HeikoS	so how are things?
 lambday	>>> print sum(probing_estimates)/len(probing_estimates) 1422.85679236 >>> print actual 1422.84404724
 lambday	working with python now
@HeikoS	this is the sparse matrix we had?
 lambday	west0479
 lambday	I took A'*A+eye
@HeikoS	ok cool
@HeikoS	is this dataset public open?
 lambday	HeikoS: I guess so
@HeikoS	http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/Harwell-Boeing/chemwest/west0479.html
 lambday	scipy is an angel
@HeikoS	lambday: yep its very cool
 lambday	great! So I can use this for all the examples, right?
@HeikoS	yeah, we just have to find the license
@HeikoS	I dont know whether we can just copy it into our gpl repo
 lambday	HeikoS: how about I store the A'A+I one in the repo, that too would be causing license issues?
@HeikoS	mmmh
@HeikoS	I dont know
@HeikoS	better check
@HeikoS	If it is one, we can download it from the python example or so
@HeikoS	The original data sets and descriptions are from the   NIST web site and were not covered by an explicit copyright.   Modifications for R data sets are covered by GPL (>= 2).
@HeikoS	so thats the way we should do it
@HeikoS	should add some comment stating where the data is from and that its not under gpl, but the changes are
 lambday	alrighty
@HeikoS	https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/NISTnls/DESCRIPTION
@HeikoS	thats how R does it
@HeikoS	lambday: your latest patch, does that work with python modular?
 lambday	HeikoS: locally it works
@HeikoS	ok cool,
@HeikoS	there were other problems too
@HeikoS	did you rebase recently?
 lambday	but on travis some examples/tests fail
 lambday	yep
@HeikoS	ok I will have a look once they are done
 lambday	HeikoS: got an weird swig related error for JobResultAggregator, left that one for the time being from adding to modular interface...
 lambday	the java modular failure was being caused by that
 lambday	oh btw I converted this to ascii for libshogune examples as well, but some changes in the load_svmlight_file in SGSparseMatrix lately and it can't read
 lambday	HeikoS: weirdly enough, I just set the max iteration limit to 10000 and it converges properly
 lambday	for CG-M
 lambday	max/min eigs are similar to the one you had for your ipython
 lambday	not same but of similar range
@HeikoS	lambday: ah annyoing with the changes
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	lanczos might converge to different things in different runs
@HeikoS	make sure the examples do not take too long to run
@HeikoS	the python ones are part of the test-suite, so should be in less than say 2-3seconds
@HeikoS	the ipython can take slightly longer (maybe 30s max)
@HeikoS	but shorter is better
@HeikoS	rather add a comment for the users that they can increase this or that to get "proper" results
 lambday	2-3 secs!
 lambday	I have to do with just 1 log-det sample then
 lambday	yeah that sounds good
 lambday	so, the matrix (mat and ascii) of A'A+I, where would it go?
@HeikoS	ok thats ok
 lambday	shogun/data?
@HeikoS	into the data repository, in fact put the original dataset there
@HeikoS	have a look at the other files
@HeikoS	and add some comment with the readme
 lambday	shogun-data?
 lambday	alright checking
@HeikoS	you can compute A^T A yourself then
 lambday	ummm... yeah, but for the libshogun ones, it would be easier if we have the final matrix too, otherwise again gotta use eigen3
 lambday	but for the time being only adding python examples
@HeikoS	lambday: thats fine isnt it?
 lambday	will add libshogun ones when load_from_svmlight works
 lambday	yeah, should be fine
@HeikoS	I mean eigen needs to be there anyway
@HeikoS	lambday: yep ok
@HeikoS	let me know how it goes
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
@HeikoS	lambday: I told some people about this stuff and they liked it a lot. In particular that you did this c-implementation
 lambday	:D
 lambday	I hope this becomes useful... but we sure need to add preconditioners
@HeikoS	lambday: yep we need those
 lambday	feels good that things work properly
 lambday	cocg too works now
@HeikoS	lambday: yep very good!
@HeikoS	probably takes much longer right?
 lambday	I checked up to rational approximation of log(A) using unit basis vectors - they work as good as triangular solvers
 lambday	for that test, they don't take long, converges within a few iterations

 besser82	sonne|work, wiking:  ^^^ happenes when -DUSE_SVMLIGHT=OFF.
@HeikoS	besser82: this looks like forgotten guards for SVMLight
 besser82	HeikoS: who in charge for this?
@HeikoS	besser82: the one who finds it :D
@HeikoS	I think in the example, there just needs to be a check whether USE_SVMLIGHT is defined
@HeikoS	and if not, not execute things
@HeikoS	or not compile to be more exact
 besser82	HeikoS: I'm no official SHOGUN, I'm afraid...  Nor do I know about C#....
@HeikoS	like #ifdef HAVE_BLABLALBA ..... #endif
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah was just a joke, could you fill in an issue
@HeikoS	besser82: I dont know who knows c# here
 besser82	HeikoS: kk, will do :D
 lambday	man shogun-data is *huge*
@HeikoS	lambday: yep
 besser82	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1600
 lambday	HeikoS: still downloading... oh and it doesn't have any README, so should I just add a separate directory for logdet and add a Readme.txt there, where I say that this matrix from this and that and GPL thing
 besser82	lambday: what are going to bundle into SHOGUN?
 besser82	lambday: s/are /&you
@HeikoS	besser82: thanks!
 lambday	besser82: adding a .mat file basically
@HeikoS	lambday: no put it there directly
@HeikoS	lambday: dont put a mat file
@HeikoS	put a more standard format like csv, like the other files in there
@HeikoS	maybe even zipped
@HeikoS	lambday: we can ask sonney2k about the license stuff later, just add for now
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. so I have it in svmlight format
@HeikoS	thats good
 lambday	HeikoS: but for python, I was planning to use the mat/mtx one
@HeikoS	lambday: you can load the thing and convert or?
 lambday	HeikoS: ya scipy.io.mmread, and then tocsc()...
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah thats good
@HeikoS	csc_matrix() from scipy.sparse
@HeikoS	also does that
 lambday	yeah
 lambday	alright
 besser82	lambday: I thought I would have been another piece of code ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: np. We all want to get that in shape, don't we?
 lambday	HeikoS: so, shall I add the mtx that I directly downloaded from the website, and then my converted ascii svmlight format one (for libshogun examples), tarzipped
 lambday	besser82: :D
@HeikoS	besser82: yes!
@HeikoS	besser82: you could also try to compile with LAPACK not being installed
@HeikoS	I fixed like 50 issues around that a few weeks ago
@HeikoS	but there are more
 lambday	HeikoS: shogun-data/testsuite/mathematics/west0479.tar.gz sounds good?

 sonne|work	gsomix: ho!
 van51	sonne|work: hey! I've started a comment on github, so I'll finish it there :)
 gsomix	sonne|work, thnx for comments!
 sonne|work	gsomix: hope they were useful...
 sonne|work	van51: ok ping me once done
 lambday	HeikoS: changed... moved it under logdet/
 gsomix	sonne|work, yep, of course. CProtobufFile is a good idea I think.
 sonne|work	HeikoS: btw have you seen almost all R examples seem to work now...
 sonne|work	HeikoS: r_modular that is
@HeikoS	sonne|work: its R modular
@HeikoS	yeah I have seen something
@HeikoS	is it wiking?
 sonne|work	only 2 failing
@HeikoS	sonne|work: is this with reference counting?
 sonne|work	I fixed them...
@HeikoS	sonne|work: wow! great job!
@HeikoS	many people will love you for that? :)
 sonne|work	I would wish we could compare if they do the right job...
 sonne|work	still things are a bit awkward
 sonne|work	e.g. there are some weird bugs
@HeikoS	sonne|work: yeah testing the interfaces somehow would be great
 sonne|work	like you do kernel.init() for linear kernel
@HeikoS	sonne|work: btw a question: where in shogun-data should sparse test matrices for log-det framework go, new folder logdet?
 sonne|work	and for some reason kernel.init_optimization is attempted to be called
@HeikoS	sonne|work: ok ...
 van51	sonne|work: done
@HeikoS	sonne|work: if we can get it working at least minimally
@HeikoS	then people would already use it, find more problems and maybe some people will start fixing them
@HeikoS	sonne|work: just have been to a stats workshop and everyone is using R
@HeikoS	its so weird
 sonne|work	HeikoS: well it is it seems http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1824/steps/test%20r_modular/logs/stdio
@HeikoS	they dont know anything else, they dont know even what else exists
 sonne|work	statistics people...

@HeikoS	votjakovr: hi!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: hope you are fine!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I thought that maybe for the notebook, one example could be on string data
@HeikoS	what do you think?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi! yeah it will be cool, do you have any particular suggestions on dataset or i could choose the data by myself?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: if you want, you can choose yourself, if not, I am just about to look something up
@HeikoS	http://www.retrovirology.com/content/5/1/110
@HeikoS	this one here is good
@HeikoS	I tried that before with an SVM
@HeikoS	the string kernel they use is implemented in shogun
@HeikoS	votjakovr: would be really cool to have a string example since most toolboxes dont have that
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, cool, i'll add one :)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe you can also compare to an SVM in the notebook? (not in the examples)
@HeikoS	this way, we could illustrate the certainties etc
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah, great idea
@HeikoS	votjakovr: if the dataset is too hard to import or so, you can choose another one, let me know ...
@HeikoS	actually, I think I might still have the plain sequence files somewhere
@HeikoS	Ill look it up at home
@HeikoS	votjakovr:  and as a standard numerical dataset, just pick something from UCI
@HeikoS	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification
@HeikoS	votjakovr: like this one ^
@HeikoS	there you can do window-glass against non-window-glass
@HeikoS	that is very popular
@HeikoS	and no missing values etc
@HeikoS	just import, normalise (remove mean and whiten or scale features to unit variance) and then it directly should work
@HeikoS	I tried it before with your binary logit classifier
@HeikoS	ok going for lunch, see you!
 votjakovr	HeikoS: Ok, thank you very much on datasets :) BTW Could you please look at some draft on gradients here: http://github.com/votjakovr/shogun/blob/feature/gp_refactoring/src/shogun/machine/gp/InferenceMethod.cpp#L142
@HeikoS	ok, will do after lunch if thats ok?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok :)
@HeikoS	cool! :)
@HeikoS	ah cool you pthreaded it?

@HeikoS	votjakovr: any reason why you used pthread rather than openmp (which makes the code more readable, although thats not a problem here)
@HeikoS	wiking: ping
 votjakovr	HeikoS: huh, good :) currently i'm using clang as a main compiler and clang doesn't support openmp yet, but we can change implementation in future, since it's pretty simple :-)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah no problem, just asking whether it was a conscious decision

@HeikoS	is there a PR?
 lambday	HeikoS: but the data I put there is in tar.gz, so
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah just sending
 lambday	HeikoS: currently I loaded the matrix from the data as if its extracted in the same dir :-/
@HeikoS	lambday: are you working in python?
@HeikoS	since in there you can easily extract compressed files
 lambday	HeikoS: two more python modular examples I thought of, one for COCG, and another is CG-M (because the rest of the solvers are pretty much common but I haven't seen these two anywhere)
 lambday	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	and the file reader fraction of shogun is working on zipped formats, too
 lambday	HeikoS: oh cool!
@HeikoS	lambday: ok cool
@HeikoS	send the PR, Ill grab a coffee now but will look later

 lisitsyn	HeikoS: .so?
@HeikoS	but I still have problems
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn	alright
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's the problem?
@HeikoS	so first of all, cmake did not detect them even though they were in /usr/lib64
@HeikoS	however -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64 -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib64 did that
@HeikoS	but now unit tests dont compile
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: sorry will get back in ten minutes
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	https://gist.github.com/karlnapf/6584235
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: re
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: did you revert your changes in cmakelists?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi
@HeikoS	yes I did
@HeikoS	git reset --hard should do it right?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: heh yeah
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: alright
@HeikoS	so any idea?
@HeikoS	first weird thing: why doesnt cmake detect my files?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so the problem is that it doesn't work when you don't do /usr/lib64
 lisitsyn	right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	-- A library with BLAS API not found. Please specify library location.
@HeikoS	-- LAPACK requires BLAS
@HeikoS	-- A library with LAPACK API not found. Please specify library location.
@HeikoS	I did not touch LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@HeikoS	(for those things)
@HeikoS	since it is /usr/lib64
@HeikoS	that should not be the problem right?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think we use default lapack finder
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	but ok
@HeikoS	I can specify the path and then it works
 lisitsyn	so that's out-of-box bug
@HeikoS	also, I checked my files, they contain that symbol
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so the main problem is that unit-tests do not compile I guess
 lisitsyn	that's more interesting
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	no other problem compiling libshogun
@HeikoS	they should also fail if lapack is not there right?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I don't know if it is still needed
@HeikoS	ah wait
@HeikoS	-- A library with BLAS API found.

@HeikoS	there is this warning
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that sounds like cmake glitch
 lisitsyn	no idea what to do about it
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	so any idea whether maybe the lib order in the build command causes this?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah may be
 lisitsyn	as your library files are here in the command line
@HeikoS	yeah and all those files exist
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: updated the issue
@HeikoS	the files also contain the symbol that is needed
@HeikoS	so it *has* to be some homemade problem
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: weird
@HeikoS	ah and annoying since I need that for work
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: so libshogun.so.14.0 is first in the list
@HeikoS	maybe it should be last?
@HeikoS	but I dont really believe that

-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f053038024.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@HeikoS	trying
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I asked wiking to add a bundle lapack option, that might help here
 wiking	HeikoS: bundle lapack is impossible
@HeikoS	wiking: why?
 wiking	HeikoS: if u can do it
 wiking	go for it
@HeikoS	I managed to compile it locally and create a shared library
 wiking	it's just crazy shit
@HeikoS	mmh ok
@HeikoS	there is this tool that helps creating the dynamic stuff
@HeikoS	http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1895
@HeikoS	wiking: do you have any idea about this problem I have?
@HeikoS	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1604
 wiking	mmm not yet
 wiking	HeikoS: what's this distro?
@HeikoS	mmh, dont know, let me find out
@HeikoS	wiking: centos
 wiking	HeikoS: which version?
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg :develop * dd41296 / cmake/version.cmake: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/dd412963294d6350b1e3ef05776e59e7a31daa6b
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: fix version (for real)
@sonney2k	besser82, ok now!
@HeikoS	cat /proc/version
@HeikoS	Linux version 2.6.18-308.13.1.el5 (mockbuild@builder10.centos.org) (gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-52)) #1 SMP Tue Aug 21 17:10:18 EDT 2012
@HeikoS	 cat /etc/issue
@HeikoS	CentOS release 5.4 (Final)
@HeikoS	wiking: ^
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i'll check it
@HeikoS	cool man thanks!
@HeikoS	wiking: oh and btw, cmake doesnt detect the installed lapack
@HeikoS	I have to give the path by hand
@sonney2k	HeikoS, errm so it compiles or what?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: nope
@sonney2k	HeikoS, it fails compiling doing what?
@HeikoS	../../src/shogun/libshogun.so.14.0: undefined reference to `dstemr_'
@HeikoS	but this symbol is there
@HeikoS	nm /usr/lib64/liblapack.so.3 | grep dstemr_

@HeikoS	ah sorry
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so it compiled!
@sonney2k	so what is missing is a proper LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
@sonney2k	when running things
 wiking	HeikoS: Iliblapack.so.3 => /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3
 wiking	this does not have dstemr_  i guess
 wiking	right?
@HeikoS	nm says "no symbols"
 wiking	HeikoS: ok so your problem is that the wrong lapack.so is being used
 besser82	wiking: It should have that symbol, since it's a rewritten lapack in c ;)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: shogun conmpiled, but its the unit tests ...
@HeikoS	wiking: ah ok
@HeikoS	so the one in lib64/atlas/ rather thanlib64
@HeikoS	how to change that?
 wiking	as sonney2k said
 wiking	LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@HeikoS	really that easy? let me try
@HeikoS	 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  ?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	try that
@HeikoS	nope
@HeikoS	doesnt work
@HeikoS	what about this list of .so files in the make command of the unit tests?
@HeikoS	in the gist
@HeikoS	sonney2k: to what do I have to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
 besser82	HeikoS, wiking: nm -D /usr/lib64/liblapack.so | grep dstemr  ---> shows the symbol is there
@HeikoS	besser82 yes it does, but liblapack.so.3 => /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3
@HeikoS	and in there, it is not
@sonney2k	HeikoS, to /usr/lib64/atlas if it is there
@HeikoS	sonney2k: doesnt work either
@HeikoS	wiking, sonney2k cant I tell the compiler somehow to reference the right library somehow else?
 lisitsyn	I just wanted to note it is dstemr_ that is missed
 lisitsyn	may be it is important here
-!- zxtx [~zv@129-79-241-50.dhcp-bl.indiana.edu] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: dstemr_ dstemr
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you have dstemr_ or dstemr?
@HeikoS	dstemr_
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I think it is as sonney2k and wiking said, libshogun.so references the wrong file, which is lib64/atlas/liblapack.so, but the file doesnt contain the symbol. However, lib64/liblapack.so contains it, I just dont know how to make libshogun reference to it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah
 lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	I tried prepending its path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the (re)-linking libshogun, but I still get the same error
 besser82	HeikoS: lib64/atlas/liblapack.so contains dstemr_ ---> nm -D /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so | grep dstemr
 lambday	HeikoS: back
 lambday	HeikoS: what's wrong with dstemr?
@HeikoS	lambday: hi! ah, dont worry about that
@HeikoS	trying to install things on weird machines
@HeikoS	lambday: I had some comments in the PR, minor things
 lambday	I added/used dstemr..  :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah checking
@HeikoS	lambday: I cannot drop lapack unfortunately since I need the Lanczos on the cluster
@HeikoS	if only eigen could do that little thing ;)
@HeikoS	then I wouldnt have these stupid problems with stupid lapack
 lambday	HeikoS: at times, I feel like adding that to eigen :-/
 lambday	HeikoS: lapack API is horrible.. I only succeded because lisitsyn explain each and every params to me one by one :D
 lambday	explained*
@HeikoS	yeah I know that, he did that for me too a while ago
 lambday	lisitsyn: kudos, master yoda!
@HeikoS	we should just get rid of lapack as soon as possible
@HeikoS	almost all things can be replaced by eigen
 lambday	HeikoS: does lapack work faster than eigen3?
@HeikoS	it just burned 3 working days of mine, so no
@HeikoS	cannot be that fast ;)
 lambday	:D
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well you suffer from bad ass ubuntu not lapack
@sonney2k	on debian you wouldn't have such trouble
@HeikoS	sonney2k: no its not ubuntu
@sonney2k	then FC*
@HeikoS	well I cannot do anything about this since its not my machine
@sonney2k	:)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: how to change this reference?
 lambday	sonney2k: you support lapack? :(
@sonney2k	HeikoS, what I would do is run make with verbose
@sonney2k	so you see the cmdline of linking libshogun
 lambday	using it is so hard
@sonney2k	then copy that line
@HeikoS	yes, its in the issue I made
@HeikoS	sonney2k: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1604
@sonney2k	and then make sure it links to the libs you want by specifying -L/path
@sonney2k	and have *the same* libs in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
@sonney2k	then it works
@sonney2k	HeikoS, where is the line?
@sonney2k	I only see attempts to link the example
@HeikoS	ah sorry, will post
@sonney2k	HeikoS, and of course LD_LIBRARY_PATH won't help with *linking* an example
@sonney2k	you need the proper -L / -l
 lambday	HeikoS: I have two files there, one mtx and another is libsvm.. I should add these individually zipped you meant
@HeikoS	lambday: why have two? why not one?
 lambday	HeikoS: the mtx one is for python modular examples, I intended to use the libsvm ones for libshogun examples
@sonney2k	HeikoS, try to add -/usr/lib64 -llapack to the end of the line
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok thanks will try
@HeikoS	sonney2k: besser82 had another suggestion, comment out find_atlas in cmake, that in fact made cmake realize the proper .so file, currently compiling this way ...
@sonney2k	you have most likely a clash between /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3 and /usr/lib64/liblapack.so.3
@sonney2k	HeikoS, that can work too
@HeikoS	 /usr/lib64/atlas/liblapack.so.3 doesnt contain the symbol thats the problem
@sonney2k	HeikoS, then just don't link against it
 besser82	sonney2k: the problem is CMakeLists.txt preferes ATLAS over FORTRAN-LAPACK
@HeikoS	sonney2k: besser82, doesnt work with disabling atlas, got even more undefined symbols
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I dont know how to not link against it
 besser82	HeikoS: export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-l/usr/lib64/lapack.so"
 besser82	and try rebuilding with ATLAS re-enabled
@HeikoS	besser82: what does that do?
 besser82	adds original LAPACK to the linker-flags
@HeikoS	so before building I need to export right?
@HeikoS	before linking I mean
 besser82	right, before configuring with comake ;)
 besser82	cmake hardcodes ldflags to Makefile
@HeikoS	besser that screws up the cmake totally
 besser82	really? What's the output?

 besser82	wb, HeikoS
@HeikoS	sorry connection dropped
@HeikoS	now compiling with verbose to see the link command of libshogun
 besser82	kk
* HeikoS is dreaming of shogun in the cloud without installation
* besser82 would say let's get started on openShift :)
@HeikoS	openshift?
 wiking	HeikoS: well it needs to be installed once on the cloud as well
 besser82	HeikoS: and will allow Software-as-a-Service ;)
 besser82	HeikoS: easy deployment with containers and cartirdges ;)
@HeikoS	besser82: yeah something like that
 besser82	HeikoS: imageine a container as a vm
@HeikoS	an ipython server would actually be enough
 wiking	besser82: is it free? :D
@HeikoS	can write code in my browser then
 besser82	wiking: openShift-community is free ;)
 wiking	besser82: yeah but not the service itself
 besser82	wiking: and that's the EXACT codebase redhat uses ;)
 besser82	wiking: a limited use is free as well
 wiking	besser82: i mean what we need is actually a machine where we can run it
 wiking	because then we already have like virtualenv
 besser82	amazon EC2?
 wiking	besser82: money? :)
 lisitsyn	wiking: CV help needed ;)
 lisitsyn	anyone else having a clue please comment too
 wiking	lisitsyn: shoot although i'm like only 10% here
 besser82	wiking: try creditcard, doesn't cost money, will be collect automatically ;)
 lisitsyn	my problem is quite silly
 lisitsyn	I have bounding box where object is probably is
@HeikoS	sonney2k, wiking so the linking command of shogun contains /usr/lib64/atlas/libatlas.so.3 /usr/lib64/liblapack.so.3 in this order
 lisitsyn	but I need to generate some candidates you know
 lisitsyn	how not-brain-damaged-people-like-me do it?
 wiking	how do u assign probabilities?
 lisitsyn	wiking: no probabilities I just learned svm and have background model
 lisitsyn	so I just track background changes
 wiking	ok so u have the bo
 wiking	x
 lisitsyn	yeah some box and I need candidates around it
 wiking	what's candidates aroudn it?
 lisitsyn	wiking: well these regions I'll apply svm to
 lambday	HeikoS: there is a bug reagarding reading gzipped mtx file in python mmread : https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2152
 lambday	HeikoS: I am adding the ImportErrors though, but not sure how to work with individual gzipped mtx files
@HeikoS	can you just only have libsvm format?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes, if I can read it from python, which I can I guess
@HeikoS	lambday: I am sure you can
