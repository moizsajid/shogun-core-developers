@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS is on a talk ^^
@besser82	at least afaik...
@HeikoS	wiking: yoyo
@HeikoS	besser82: hey man!
@besser82	HeikoS, Hey!  :D
@besser82	You came good home last night?
@besser82	How are Emti && Dino doing?
@HeikoS	wiking: btw i talked to besser82 and sonney2k_ about the build scripts, they dont know what you need exactly (for the nightly docker images)
@thoralf	Hey *.*
@HeikoS	besser82: all fine, we ended up staying at a place next to where i slept for a bit
@HeikoS	besser82: quite tired
@HeikoS	nw
@HeikoS	now
@besser82	HeikoS, I got up @ ~8h
@besser82	o'clock
@HeikoS	besser82:  me too :)
@thoralf	Stop crying ;)
@besser82	HeikoS, hehe ^^
@besser82	thoralf, :-P  Me isn't crying ^^
* besser82 is all happy, through and through ^^
@wiking	HeikoS: i need package scripts :D
@wiking	to be either be able to create .deb or .rpm package of shogun
@besser82	wiking, I'll work on this tommorow ^^
@wiking	HeikoS: i told this several times :P
@wiking	HeikoS: what's the status now with the e.V.?
@besser82	so you will endup having a usable rpm.spec after cmake-configure...
@HeikoS	wiking: no lets discuss this script thing first
@thoralf	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: nobody knows what that is, everyone is confused, so lets make it concrete
@HeikoS	wiking: sonney2k_ has no idea what you mean
@HeikoS	he tells me you have everything
@wiking	HeikoS: well sonne|work generates somehow the .deb packages (debian rules file)
@wiking	i dont have that
@wiking	i dont even know where is that actually
@HeikoS	wiking: ok
@HeikoS	the one here?
@wiking	where?
@HeikoS	wiking: https://packages.qa.debian.org/s/shogun.html
@HeikoS	oh wow we are migrated to testing
@HeikoS	besser82: do you have an idea where this thing is?
@besser82	HeikoS, which thing? the debian/rules?
@HeikoS	besser82: see above
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	the rules file
@wiking	that generates the .deb packages
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS: over here:  http://bollin.googlecode.com/svn/shogun/trunk/debian/
@HeikoS	wiking: thoralf and me discussed and a bit and concluded that #1 priority has to be binary packages for debian/ubuntu and a brew formula for mac (thoralf will deal with the latter)
@wiking	brew?
@wiking	i was working now till with macports :)
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS: but that doesn't generate bindings-stuff...
@HeikoS	wiking: do we even have that?
@wiking	what?
@wiking	or whic?
@wiking	*which
@wiking	macports or bindings? :)
@HeikoS	wiking: bindings for debian
@wiking	btw instead of brew it would be better to concentrate on .dmg
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah
@wiking	or no? :)
@wiking	i have no idea
@HeikoS	wiking: thoralf and the research gate engineer have a differen opinion, they know what theyre doing so I trust them, i have no idea myself
@HeikoS	wiking: but the goal would be that people can type "brew install shogun" and then things are doine
@wiking	thoralf: ping
@HeikoS	wiking: about the python bindings
@wiking	HeikoS: but that's worse than .dmg
@HeikoS	wiking: can you build these things yourself?
@wiking	https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=jessie&searchon=names&keywords=shogun
@wiking	there
@wiking	there is python-shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: they will deal with it, thoralf will do a nightly mac thing, but lets sort out the doicker stuff
@thoralf	pong
@wiking	thoralf: why brew?
@wiking	i mean we have macports (but of course that's outdated as well)
@HeikoS	besser82: python bindings debian package rules?
@wiking	i rather fix the dmg generation in cmake than to hack with brew
@thoralf	wiking: Because I colleague told me it's state-of-the-art and everybody uses it.
@thoralf	:D
@wiking	thoralf: nonsense :)
@wiking	thoralf: i know from gstreamer guys
@wiking	that the biggest boost for getting new users
@HeikoS	besser82: the link you gave just contains the libshogun rules
@thoralf	wiking: I don't care about which technology to use.  I found someone who would write a brew formula for shogun.
@wiking	was to deliver .pkg for osx
@wiking	thoralf: can he do cmake?
@HeikoS	wiking: I agree with thoralf, if the guy can do something and then it works that worth a lot
@HeikoS	wiking: maybe something else is better but worth nothing if it doesnt work
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i mean dont get me wrong i'm not against it
@HeikoS	wiking: I get your point
@thoralf	wiking: I'm not using Mac at all.  Do whatever you like.
@thoralf	:D
@HeikoS	wiking: this is just an opportunity and we should use it since the two guys are motivated
@wiking	i'm just saying that instead of innvesting n amount of hour to to brew formula
@wiking	let's invest n hours into pkg with cmake
@wiking	which gives bigger coverage
@HeikoS	wiking: understood
@HeikoS	wiking: we need one line installer, the rest doesnt matter to me
@wiking	two who?
@wiking	HeikoS: no we need click installer
@wiking	i.e. pkg
@HeikoS	wiking: but since thoralf and his collegue got excited ,why not try?
@HeikoS	wiking: yep agree
@HeikoS	besser82: push
@wiking	sure there's already the macports Portfile
@HeikoS	besser82: where are the python scripts?
@wiking	which only requires the change of download url + md5 hash
@wiking	nevermind the more the merrier
@HeikoS	wiking: i cant judge, i see this from a motivation kind of view
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah exactly, lets just see what works
@besser82	which python-scripts, HeikoS ?!?
@besser82	there are none for debian, yet...
@HeikoS	besser82: the scripts that generate shogun-python bindings
@HeikoS	besser82: but check this
@HeikoS	besser82: https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=jessie&searchon=names&keywords=shogun
@HeikoS	python-shogun is in there
@HeikoS	besser82:  https://packages.debian.org/jessie/python-shogun
@wiking	*behttps://packages.debian.org/jessie/python-shogun
@wiking	yeah that one
@HeikoS	thoralf: what are the next steps for this mac thing to take off?
@besser82	HeikoS, wiking already got it  ;)
@wiking	besser82: where?
@wiking	besser82: i need the scripts to generate python-shogun
@besser82	wiking, HeikoS:  http://bollin.googlecode.com/svn/python-shogun/trunk/debian/  ^^
@wiking	that way i can at least start generating
@wiking	nightly .deb of shogun
@wiking	and that i can start using for the docker image
@HeikoS	wiking: is this link fine?
@wiking	pretty simple... i just missed the scripts to generate the packages
@wiking	well i'll check
@wiking	and i'll scream if i get stuck
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome!
@HeikoS	wiking: would be just amazing to have nightly docker
@HeikoS	besser82: how are the videos going?
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@178.19.210.162] has quit [Quit: PirosB3]
@HeikoS	wiking: is it hard to build a ppa where we provide nightly debs for debian/ubuntu (includinbg backports)?
@wiking	HeikoS: currently we have bigger issue than this
@HeikoS	wiking: like?
@wiking	that is all our modular interfaces are broken with swig 3.x
@wiking	moreover c# interface is totally broken
@HeikoS	wiking: i dont agree
@wiking	HeikoS: what do you mean you dont agree?
@HeikoS	wiking: i think libshogun, shogun-python binaries should have top priority
@wiking	you cannot use python modulr
@wiking	on any osx machine
@wiking	or any recent linux distro
@HeikoS	wiking: since new swig?
@wiking	yes
@wiking	since swig 3.0
@wiking	we are broken
@HeikoS	wiking: my ubuntu has swig2
@HeikoS	and thats the latest
@wiking	well that's your ubuntu
@wiking	try archlinux
@HeikoS	wiking: i agree its important to fix this
@HeikoS	wiking: very important
@wiking	and we dont know what's causing it at all
@wiking	so what's with e.v. founding?
@besser82	HeikoS, wiking: I'm outie now, need to catch my train...
@HeikoS	wiking: but as said, the people with ubuntu 12.04, some debian  and mac  are the majority, and for them we could not install shogun within 4 hours on the workshop
@wiking	mac is broken atm
@HeikoS	wiking: so we spend half the day trying to install, and that scares people off
@HeikoS	wiking: i know
@wiking	as i said only libshogun works on mac now
@HeikoS	wiking: but still nightly binary build for a mainstream linux would help *so* much
@wiking	ok so i'm asking
@HeikoS	wiking: and then once this is on the bot
@HeikoS	wiking: we should straight away make the other things work
@wiking	14:16 <@wiking> so what's with e.v. founding?
@wiking	this is being done since last workshop
@HeikoS	wiking: yes i know, talked to s?ren about it
@wiking	i.e. 1 full year
@HeikoS	wiking: everything is done, just need to print and bring to bank
@HeikoS	ehm to court
@HeikoS	s?ren said he can try, but i will also ask a family member of mine
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	that is being done for about 6+ months
@HeikoS	wiking: there was the bank account issue (we need one), but turns out we have one
@HeikoS	wiking: nope i did not have some things
@HeikoS	wiking: but now compete since last week in fact
@wiking	ok so eta?
@HeikoS	wiking: i know thats high priority also
@wiking	2 months
@HeikoS	wiking: no less
@wiking	3 months?
@HeikoS	wiking: ill push this now
@HeikoS	remind me if you like, but i really want to do this next, you are titally right
@wiking	let's say can we have it done till end of september?
@HeikoS	wiking: yes lets aim for that
@wiking	as now it's summer
@wiking	ppl go on holidays
@wiking	etc etc
@HeikoS	wiking: i know, problem is i was swamped the last few months
@wiking	but i reckon end of september if we really have everything could be feasible... or at least this is how i see from the info i have
@HeikoS	wiking: spent already so much time on shogun, and thought the gsoc is more important
@HeikoS	wiking: yes i agree
@wiking	HeikoS: i know but still
@wiking	1 year is really a lot for such a problem to be solved
@HeikoS	wiking: i agree with you, thanks for pushing,
@HeikoS	wiking: so what do you think about the ubuntu ppa? just for python modular?
@wiking	so let's say if we dont have this ready by mid-october we'll create a non-profit organisation somewhere else
@HeikoS	wiking: once this is on the bot, we can keep it green
@wiking	ok?
@HeikoS	wiking: ok!
@wiking	as we could as well create that in .uk
@wiking	or really virtually anywhere
@wiking	where the laws are allowing it
@wiking	and there's a lot of places
@wiking	ppa is not a problem at all
@wiking	we'll register a launchpad acc for shogun
@wiking	but ther'es a problem for example
@wiking	for 12.04 ppl
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah?
@wiking	that eigen3 is not available by default
@HeikoS	eigen
@HeikoS	wiking: ok thats a problem
@wiking	but let's say we don't want to support the last LTS
@wiking	or?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: last lts is most important
@wiking	let's support the latest LTS
@HeikoS	thats at least something
@wiking	14.04
@HeikoS	wiking: can i do anything to help with this?
@wiking	which shouldn't be a problem at all
@wiking	nah i'll try to use the debian rule files
@wiking	and create stuff for ubuntu
@wiking	and will create a ppa for it
@wiking	but i want to first at least finish my c# modular investigation
@wiking	why it fails with mono 3.x compiler
@wiking	so that at least the osx modular buildbot gets in a working shape
@HeikoS	wiking: ok cool, i mean this can be done in parallel
@wiking	btw any news on a machine/mac donation?
@HeikoS	wiking: but the ppa should be up before next release
@HeikoS	wiking: and we should have two: nightly and stable
@wiking	HeikoS: next release is as usual post-gsoc no?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah gunnar will give us a machine, he prepared it already, talked to him on the phone last week
@HeikoS	wiking: he is in holiday currently but willdo it afterwards, i might also visit soon and then i can push a bit more
@wiking	hehe
@HeikoS	wiking: i would do it in just before the evaluations so that students can help
@HeikoS	wiking: with warnings etc
@HeikoS	wiking: and so that we dont postpone it
@HeikoS	wiking: should do straight away
@HeikoS	wiking: and then bugfix/usability releases afterwards
@wiking	well
@wiking	HeikoS: put up a milestone for it on github
@wiking	with a date then
@wiking	so that we can start puting together the blocking issues
@HeikoS	wiking: yep good
@HeikoS	wiking: but lets just push it in the last gsoc meeting
@HeikoS	wiking: ill organise one soon
@wiking	HeikoS: i mean it doesn't have to be a mac machine necessarily
@HeikoS	wiking: i know, but would be good right?
@wiking	as u see i've managed to do it other way
-!- PirosB3 [~pirosb3@178.19.210.162] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: well thats super cool
@HeikoS	wiking: ok then
@wiking	well basically now we are at a level
@HeikoS	wiking: emt also suggested to host a machine, ill ask him
@wiking	where fatbot is getting exhausted
@HeikoS	wiking: what kind of access do you need?
@wiking	so we could do some extra hosting power
@wiking	to distribute the bots
@HeikoS	wiking: yep
@HeikoS	wiking: i agree
@wiking	well the best is of course root access
@HeikoS	wiking: should do a mixcture of uni donations and some other things
@HeikoS	wiking: still waiting for this company to get back
@HeikoS	wiking: but will meet the contact guy some time next week
@wiking	k
@wiking	so
@wiking	next release is 3.3.0?
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah guess so, s?ren wanted 4, but i dont really care
@wiking	4 should we when we modularize shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: yep i agree
@HeikoS	wiking: so btw i talked to thoralf about some internal cleanups
@HeikoS	wiking: what do you think about getting rid of our own parameter framework and use some external thing instead?
@wiking	if it's easy to integrate
@wiking	for sure why not?
@wiking	anything in mind?
@HeikoS	wiking: protobuf
@wiking	no please not protobuf
@HeikoS	wiking: or even boost, but i know you guys don tlike that
@HeikoS	wiking: i dont know this stuff, thoralf liked it
@HeikoS	wiking: whats wrong with it?
@wiking	the current integration of protobuf is really fucking aweful in shogun
@wiking	but w8 a second
@wiking	what does protobuf have to do with parameter fw?
@HeikoS	wiking: ok, so i guess we should discuss
@HeikoS	wiking: the idea is
@wiking	protobuf is for serialization
@HeikoS	1.) use something external for serialisation
@HeikoS	2.) that gives equals and clone (first use of our parameter framework)
@HeikoS	3.) drop model selection framework (second big use)
@HeikoS	3) (the grid search stuff)
@wiking	well afaik protobuf solves you 1)
@HeikoS	wiking: yes, i think this was the idea
@thoralf	Guys, I can't participate in your discussion because still at work and quity busy.
@thoralf	I'll read the logs.
@wiking	HeikoS: ok but what about 2 and 3? :)
@HeikoS	wiking: serialisation gives a clone method right?
@wiking	well
@wiking	in a funky way
@HeikoS	wiking: why funky?
@HeikoS	wiking: probably faster than the current way
@wiking	if you look at clone() being in-memory serialization-deserialization
@wiking	then yes
@HeikoS	wiking: thats what we do, but we iterate over lots of if then else statements the do the memory copying word wise
@HeikoS	wiking: equals should also work then right?
-!- kislay_ [~Abhijeet@210.212.61.185] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
@HeikoS	wiking: we dont get an accuracy parameter though
@HeikoS	wiking: which is an issue
@HeikoS	wiking: and 3) i dont know
@wiking	no a serialization fw doesn't support these type ot things
@wiking	like equals
@HeikoS	wiking: ok thats a problem then
@HeikoS	wiking: well ok, not priority this one
@HeikoS	wiking: priority is making the toolbox easy to install
@HeikoS	wiking: then we can see, if we get this, we are already miles ahead of now
@HeikoS	wiking: i gotta go now, thanks for the discussion
@HeikoS	wiking: lets push besser82 a bit to upload the videos fast :)
