 alesis-novik	going to move to a private flat

 blackburn	alesis-novik: we are pretty near to release!
 alesis-novik	blackburn, yeah. I'm trying to polish some of the documentation so it would be clear how to use the classes
 blackburn	alesis-novik: you could add some libshogun test to get sure your gmm things doesn't crash
 blackburn	these ones are easiest to debug
 blackburn	(no swig and other govno)
 alesis-novik	blackburn, I think I worked out most of the bugs already. I might add a warning in some places though
 blackburn	I'm not about to say you have bugs ;) it would be easier to get to know that we have broke something if there was more libshogun examples

 f-x	sonney2k: in sparse features eg. '2:3.1 5:1.5' etc. should the feature 2:3.1 have a feat_index of 1 or 2?

@sonney2k	f-x, great - I guess you have to make this an option - sth like set_indexing_type(ONE_BASED) / ZERO_BASED
 f-x	sonney2k: ah, ok.. how does SparseFeatures do it now though?
@sonney2k	f-x, everything in shogun is zero-based
 f-x	sonney2k: by zero-based you mean '1:5.0' has feat_index=0?
@sonney2k	yes
 f-x	ok, clarifies a lot
 blackburn	sonney2k: we both answered the same to andreas lol :D
 blackburn	I didn't notice that it CCed to you too so you didn't receive that answer
@sonney2k	blackburn, well done

@sonney2k	blackburn, did you make any progress w/ the java examples?
-!- f-x [~user@117.192.216.242] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 blackburn	sonney2k: not yet, will do some more this night
@sonney2k	would be great - that's the last language  that doesn't run
 blackburn	ruby?
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it working now?
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	sonney2k: but it fails on buildbot?
@sonney2k	buildbot didn't run the latest version - no idea why
@sonney2k	blackburn, serialhex promised to do a few more example conversions
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is some bug in strings java typemap
 blackburn	2 examples
 blackburn	other 2 is pretty simple
 blackburn	and I have to finish transition back to "main" from "run" with parameter list
@sonney2k	4 examples fail now rigth?
 blackburn	on the buildbot 5
 blackburn	it is strange because ppwm doesn't fail on my machin
 blackburn	sonney2k: so when are you planning to release?
@sonney2k	Aug 31
@sonney2k	wednesday
@sonney2k	but I would like to send an email with a pre-release to the ML before
 blackburn	if nothing really serious with java things - I hope it will be finished today
@sonney2k	what is still missing (biggest issue) is heikos migrations
@sonney2k	then make doc
 blackburn	what else?
@sonney2k	make release script (no longer working since we transitioned from svn)
 blackburn	what does release script do?
@sonney2k	and of course test suite should pass once heikos migrations work

@sonney2k	blackburn, release script builds everything once, generates documentation, tarball, signs the tarball, copies tarball/documentation to website and updates website
@sonney2k	all automagic
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	sonney2k: how the modular things work as debian package?
 blackburn	i.e. how it is divided that can be installed again
 blackburn	there is no compilation during installation of package, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh true debian package is another todo
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://z0r.de/2186 :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, we compile for everything and then upload
@sonney2k	err split the things up
