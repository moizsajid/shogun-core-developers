 tom__	hi all!
 sonne|work	hey
 tom__	Is it possible to choose the norm for printing float number with shogun ?
 tom__	'.' or ','
 tom__	for float
 tom__	I am printing roc matrix and delimiters are ',' and float have the form like "0,4555"
 tom__	so that's confusing : too much ','
 tom__	how to switch from european decimal format "0,50" to "0.50" ?
