 blackburn	sonney2k: which SVM test failures are ok?
 blackburn	subgradient, ocas, sgd are failing now
@sonney2k	blackburn, only HMM or more?
 blackburn	sonney2k: nothing extra
@sonney2k	ocas, sgd should not fail
 blackburn	sonney2k: they are
@sonney2k	did these fail in 1.0.0?
@sonney2k	wait these did fail in 1.0?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hate checking it but I will
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rd320074 / (4 files): Added embed kernel for the kernel LLE - http://git.io/0Qj8PQ
 blackburn	these elections results is fucking disappointing again
 blackburn	are
 blackburn	I'm just like 'I haz it' russian
 blackburn	:D

 blackburn	too
@sonney2k	blackburn, you meant this http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/04/vladimir-putin-majority-complaints-violations
 blackburn	sonney2k: that's fucking unbelievable piece of shit
 blackburn	in moscow exit-polls showed that this fucking party has ~30%
 blackburn	but results are >45%
 blackburn	too much people left russia already, I'm the one who will do the same in the next few years
 blackburn	sonney2k: you said everybody cheats, but in some regions there is 99% rating of government party
 blackburn	formally
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://cs5497.vk.com/u649772/12134085/z_42b8a547.jpg
@sonney2k	back to getting 1.1 ready - so we need to fix these 3-4 regressions and then we are OK right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: HMM only
@sonney2k	even better - so what was the result of your git bisect?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I failed to detect it
 blackburn	and didn't managed to do this thing again
@sonney2k	blackburn, 99% in a election? not even nazis managed to get that...
 blackburn	sonney2k: chechnya did
 blackburn	sonney2k: statistician hell here: with 10% counted 'united russia' result was 45%
 blackburn	now with 50% counted it is >50%
 blackburn	massively cheating, really unbelievable
 blackburn	actually they get 20-25%, not more
@sonney2k	blackburn, wait you said that HMM was working in shogun 1.0.0?
@sonney2k	but isn't now?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	I am looking at the changelog
@sonney2k	and it is just this
@sonney2k	-CHMM::CHMM(void)
@sonney2k	+CHMM::CHMM()
@sonney2k	so I would suspect it either works in 1.0 and 1.1 or hell freezes ;-)
 blackburn	ehmm
 blackburn	sonney2k: I tested already three times or more
@sonney2k	or - we did regenerate tests?
 blackburn	we didn't
@sonney2k	but how is this possible??
 blackburn	something dependent changed
@sonney2k	true
@sonney2k	but that could only be some stringfeature related stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you test it anyhow?
 blackburn	may be old projects or so
 blackburn	where you know what result should look like
@sonney2k	not now - I have to sleep now. I will try tomorrow...
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok, thanks
 blackburn	I'll try to fix customkernel later
 blackburn	see you
