 blackburn	uricamic: we are waiting for your contributions ;)
 uricamic	blackburn: working on it ;-)
@sonney2k	uricamic, what are you working on?
 uricamic	I want to implement bundle methods for structured output learning
 uricamic	I have some matlab implementations
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess you know this guy? ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, :P
@sonney2k	uricamic, what I meant is what you are working on as a patch
 uricamic	I will start with some basic implementation of BMRM
@sonney2k	uricamic, can you do that in a few days already?
 uricamic	I hope so
@sonney2k	uricamic, since deadline is on apr 6 - show us some progress via github pull request. just mark them with [Work in Progress]
@sonney2k	alright
@sonney2k	have to leave the train
 uricamic	ok, I will do that tommorow, if its ok
@sonney2k	and enjoy a shower in the rain :D
@sonney2k	uricamic, yes of course
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	uricamic: you could also consider some small patches btw
 uricamic	blacburn: any ideas what it should be?
 blackburn	uricamic: I can come up with something if you need it
 uricamic	blackburn: ok, I would appreciate it
 blackburn	uricamic: it seems you are a kind of CV expert?
 uricamic	I wouldn't say expert, just know some stuff :)
 blackburn	uricamic: what about parzen window classifier?
 uricamic	blackburn: well, I can do that
 blackburn	uricamic: are you familiar with shogun structure/code/etc?
 uricamic	blackburn: I started to explore the code and to get familiar with it
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	then it could be a good introduction
 blackburn	however if you notice any other classifier that is not in shogun feel free to add it
 uricamic	ok, I will look at it soon

 blackburn	n4nd0: aren't you sleeping?? wtf
 harshit_	blackburn: do you know from which MATLAB/C implementation, incomplete LBP features is implemented
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have been around here for a while now man
 blackburn	harshit_: they are implemented in libocas
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah.. now I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: actually, I have to go soon to pick up my second laundry :P
 harshit_	I guess that "part"  has only 2 hrs right ?
 blackburn	n4nd0: you have to rest man, we don't want you to die :D

 sonne|work	n4nd0: I am not sure no
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok
 sonne|work	my guess is that something was already scheduled before and because the bot was busy it didn't update to a newer version
 blackburn	sonne|work: http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/ awesome stuff
 sonne|work	blackburn: license?
 blackburn	sonne|work: matlab code anyway
 sonne|work	well mex stuff
 blackburn	sonne|work: can't see any license at all
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'm going to port these things
 sonne|work	but make sure that if you want to use their code to get a license statement
 blackburn	sonne|work: group / tree / overlap lasso is a kind of MT so would be nice to have these
 blackburn	sonne|work: I'd rather contact authors
 sonne|work	well it is kind of MKL too :)
 sonne|work	yeah of course contact authors to get that statement

 wiking	anybody tried to compile shogun with clang?
 sonne|work	wiking: sure - the debian package is clang compiled
 wiking	since now i've just switched to it and i have a lot of warnings and errors while compiling... so i was just wondering if anybody is doing fixing so i could join
 sonne|work	it needs a lot less memory on clang
 sonne|work	errors too?
 wiking	yep
 sonne|work	these are new then :D
 sonne|work	fixes and reports welcome
 wiking	[latent src] $ clang --version                                                                                                                       [wiking@welitron:~/shogun/src]
 wiking	Apple clang version 3.1 (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.58) (based on LLVM 3.1svn)
 wiking	Target: x86_64-apple-darwin11.3.0
 wiking	Thread model: posix
 sonne|work	should all be trivial though...
 wiking	yeah they are quite trivial
 wiking	i was just wondering if anybody started fixing
 wiking	but then i'll do a new branch and start the cleanup
 sonne|work	don't do warnings for now
 sonne|work	but only errors
 sonne|work	however, clang has much better warnings...
 wiking	okkiee
 wiking	but it's amazing how faster it compiles for me
 sonne|work	yes and it needs just 1GB of mem not 3.7 :D

 blackburn	I need to know the error to answer ;)
 harshit_	error: undefined reference to 'log'
 harshit_	in 'svmocas.c ' and 'libocas.c
 blackburn	try to add cmath include or so
 blackburn	put #include<math.h> and try again
 harshit_	Its already included !
 blackburn	nice bug then
 blackburn	sonne|work: is there any reason to use clang?
 harshit_	btw to run mex files, do we need to have some library or so

 harshit_	sonne|work: I have seen the Makefile, in there -lm is already linked while compiling
 sonne|work	harshit_: wrong order then try to put -lm at the end
 sonne|work	(or beginning)
 harshit_	okay
 harshit_	same error ! have a look at what my shell says : http://snipt.org/uhaB6
 sonne|work	gcc -msse -O3 -fPIC -fstrict-aliasing -fomit-frame-pointer -Wall -pthread -lm -O svmocas svmocas.c lib_svmlight_format.c sparse_mat.c ocas_helper.c libocas.c libqp_splx.c -lm
 sonne|work	try this ^
 harshit_	sonne|work : it worked :)
 harshit_	thanks,btw what was the problem ?
 sonne|work	order in which libraries are specified matters - objects that need a symbol need the library -l'd past the object
 harshit_	yeah ! right ..
 harshit_	sonne|work: btw I am beginning work on LBP features, hope I can complete it till next week !

 emrecelikten	Would anybody be interested in implementing Gaussian HMMs in Shogun as a GSoC project?
 emrecelikten	I mean, HMMs with multi-variate Gaussians as observations
 sonne|work	emrecelikten: I would love to have them but we are lacking manpower aka mentors that could do this
 sonne|work	nevertheless - if you would work on this we certainly accept  your patch

 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, I think of it
 n4nd0	blackburn: what project is he applying for so I can read the idea on the webpage?
 blackburn	n4nd0: various usability improvements
 blackburn	n4nd0: just think how can we improve usability
 sonne|work	blackburn, gsomix - I could also imagine to get the testsuite to run for python/python_modular :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: not feasible :D
 sonne|work	yeah tough - but my impression is that the list on the website is long already?!
 n4nd0	blackburn: chef support
 sonne|work	sgvector -> refcounts
 blackburn	sonne|work: yes, we need chef support
 sonne|work	ASSERT -> SG_ERROR
 sonne|work	octave sparse modular typemaps
 blackburn	performance (time,memory) measures
 sonne|work	typemaps for crossvalidation
 sonne|work	director classes
 sonne|work	that is a lot already
 blackburn	sonne|work: we both (n4ndo and I) think we should be the first Chef library (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(programming_language))
 blackburn	I believe it would be very useful

 n4nd0	with 5 ml GaussianKernel
 sonne|work	great work
 n4nd0	and 100g SimpleFeatures
 PhilTillet	sonne|work: integrating OpenCL to shogun is non-trivial from a design point of view. :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: what about SGNDArray's serialization issue?
 blackburn	large scale means there are more than 5 kg of features
 PhilTillet	blackburn: kg? :D
 blackburn	yes
 PhilTillet	like kilogram
 blackburn	exactly
 sonne|work	n4nd0: that is too tough
 n4nd0	PhilTillet: we plan to work on chef support http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(programming_language)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: should be sth you with help of heiko could attempt
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok
 PhilTillet	n4nd0: what about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers ?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think better solution is to rewrite shogun with chef
 PhilTillet	maybe we could write an IP over Avian Carriers protocol in Chef
 blackburn	PhilTillet: that should be our baseline for distributed stuff
 n4nd0	lol
 n4nd0	this part of the article is pretty sad
 n4nd0	On 28 April 2001, IPoAC was actually implemented by the Bergen Linux user group.[4] They sent nine packets over a distance of approximately five kilometers (three miles), each carried by an individual pigeon and containing one ping (ICMP Echo Request), and received four responses.
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok let you reimplement shogun in chef
 n4nd0	blackburn: I'm with it
 blackburn	I'll check your code at 18 UTC
 blackburn	I hope it will have been done by this moment
 blackburn	n4nd0: later you will collaborate with PhilTillet on pigeon communicated distributed chef-based shogun
 blackburn	that's the plan
 PhilTillet	great idea
 PhilTillet	can I submit a GSoC proposal about that,
 PhilTillet	?
 blackburn	yes exactly
 blackburn	other ideas became outdated
 PhilTillet	:D
 n4nd0	do we have a mentor for that?
 blackburn	sonne|work: will you mentor it?

 blackburn	or overvodked
 blackburn	n4nd0: there was a english tutorial based on vodka word
 blackburn	I have been vodking since I was 3
 blackburn	he vodked yesterday
 blackburn	I will be vodking tomorrow

 n4nd0	emrecelikten: I cannot tell you how many people have applied to that project with certainty, but there have some mails in the mailing list of people interested in that project
 n4nd0	blackburn: one question about covertree

@sonney2k	n4nd0, emrecelikten but it usually doesn't make sense to apply to more than 2-3 things better ask here who is applying for what
@sonney2k	to see if there is still a chance...
-!- flxb [~cronor@fb.ml.tu-berlin.de] has quit [Quit: flxb]
 emrecelikten	I'm thinking abou applying to C5.0 and the one that incorporates SO-SVMs and HM-SVMs
@sonney2k	blackburn, I finally think I understand why development branches are a good idea
@sonney2k	one can mess around like hell in such branch
@sonney2k	and then merge cherry-pick / polished stuff
@sonney2k	but it only makes sense if one collaborates on a certain feature
 emrecelikten	So that makes only 2 projects, which is fine I guess?

@sonney2k	gsomix, btw you could add to your proposal clang/llvm support
@sonney2k	gsomix, i.e. fix errors and warnings to get shogun to work with clang
-!- Johannes_ [55e5c1c3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.229.193.195] has joined #shogun
 Johannes_	Hello, silly question perhaps but what's an reasonable build time for shogun? Been an unreasonable amount of time and figure it's died..
@sonney2k	Johannes_, what hardware / how much memory?
 Johannes_	it's an mac air 1.4dualcore with 2gb
@sonney2k	Johannes_, yeah well it will require between 2-3GB to compile w/ gcc
 Johannes_	haha it just completed, thanks for the response :=
@sonney2k	so use clang to reduce the memory footprint...
 Johannes_	Just got a bit worried after 15mi
 n4nd0	Johannes_: it is a good idea to use the flag --disable-optimizations to reduce compile time
@sonney2k	Johannes_, or just compile libshogun - that doesn't need a lot
@sonney2k	./configure --interfaces=
@sonney2k	(will compile libshogun only)
 Johannes_	ok cool. good to know in general
 Johannes_	but non-existing problem solved
@sonney2k	but if you compile for *all* interfaces it can take >15min!
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I've checked before how to use CoverTree for KNN
 Johannes_	I think perhaps I underestimated the size of it all.
 n4nd0	sonney2k: just one thought, my plan this far is to add a boolena member, e.g. m_use_covertree
 n4nd0	sonney2k: and just add in the methods that are already implemented something like if ( m_use_covertree )
 n4nd0	sonney2k: get the k neighbors using the cover tree
 n4nd0	sonney2k: else, do the stuff it is now implemented (with quick sort and so)
 n4nd0	sonney2k: do you think it is ok like this or something would be better?
 n4nd0	something else, I wanted to say
@sonney2k	n4nd0, perfectly ok - that is exactly how I would do it too
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :) let's get to it then
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r1aa40a1 / (6 files in 4 dirs): fix a couple of clang related warnings (which infact were errors) - http://git.io/rfiUzA
* gsomix have returned from the dance floor.
 gsomix	hi
 gsomix	sonney2k, ok.
 blackburn	whoa
 blackburn	sonney2k: not sure I got your idea about branches
 blackburn	actually I have never used cherry-pick
 blackburn	n4nd0: here?
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah
 n4nd0	blackburn: tell me
 blackburn	n4nd0: about covertree?
 blackburn	main reason is they are not generalized
 blackburn	i.e. while isomap and lle are similar
 blackburn	klle has different type of distance
 blackburn	and so on
 n4nd0	but if it is just because of the distance, can it be parametrized with CDistance?
 blackburn	in next iterations of 'libedrt' I am going to get it more generalized though
 blackburn	yes but would require to change all the code
 blackburn	I'm on the way
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	apart from this that just seems to be a better design
 blackburn	n4nd0: however I'd suggest to add one new covertree point structure
 n4nd0	do you think there is more room for improvement in libedrt?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: one new covertree point structure in KNN you mean right?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure, I am working on that
 blackburn	n4nd0: the reason is simple
 n4nd0	blackburn: something similar to SPE and the others
 blackburn	while lle/isomap/spe stuff will be general
 blackburn	I can not generalize KNN and libedrt
-!- Johannes_ [55e5c1c3@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.229.193.195] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 blackburn	libedrt makes use of user_data with provided distance function
 blackburn	but in KNN it would be enough to have pointer to distance instance
 n4nd0	I see
 n4nd0	sonney2k: how is the number of proposals so far by the way?
 blackburn	let me guess
 blackburn	hmhmhmmh
 blackburn	24
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	I say 20

 shogun-buildbot	build #199 of nightly_none is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_none/builds/199
 gsomix	shogun-buildbot, good work. Please talk to me.
 gsomix	:(
 blackburn	forever alone
 gsomix	yep
 gsomix	only vodka would be with me
 n4nd0	:D
 n4nd0	blackburn: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/converter/StochasticProximityEmbedding.cpp
 n4nd0	blackburn: check there, line 196
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think that can be done with j from i+1
 n4nd0	agree?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes
 blackburn	I assume distances are symmetric
 n4nd0	blackburn: for KNN is the same then
 n4nd0	we have distance(features, features)
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm check for euclidean distance is still there
 blackburn	I believe it is not true
 blackburn	what is the difference between euclidean and any other distance?
 n4nd0	blackburn: you believe that it is not true that they are symmetric?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	n4nd0: in the spe
 blackburn	you allow only euclidean distance
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	why so?
 n4nd0	in the toolbox they do it with Euclidean
 n4nd0	I believed it must be that done
 n4nd0	but it might be that another one works
 blackburn	n4nd0: ok let us consider dataset X ;)
 blackburn	and some distance function
 blackburn	lets also consider distance matrix of this distance function between feature vectors of X
 n4nd0	yeah
 blackburn	does there exist a dataset T with euclidean distances equal to ones of X?
 n4nd0	yes, I think so
 n4nd0	if you apply the same transformation (a rotation or displacement) to all the points in the dataset
 n4nd0	I believe the Eculidean distance won't change
 blackburn	so no matter what distance do you use
 n4nd0	eculidean ha!
 blackburn	some other one distance is just an explicit transformation to T
 blackburn	implicit sorry
 blackburn	eculid
 n4nd0	I don't know that property
 blackburn	n4nd0: I'm pretty sure with it

 n4nd0	blackburn: I believe you, but didn't know about it
 blackburn	n4nd0: kernel trick does the same
 blackburn	while distance and kernels have some relations I'd say itis the same
 n4nd0	ok
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw do you know where kernel trick came from?
 n4nd0	blackburn: the idea?
 blackburn	yes
 n4nd0	not really
 n4nd0	where?
 n4nd0	already before in another place?
 blackburn	aizerman, theoretical foundations of the potential functions for pattern recognition
 blackburn	IIR the name C
 blackburn	1964
 blackburn	IIRC :)

 n4nd0	sometimes my shell dies
 blackburn_	shell?
 n4nd0	terminal
 blackburn_	do you use shell irc client?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	you don't?
 blackburn_	currently I am under the hood of firewall of access point so have to use web client
 n4nd0	oh! I thought because once I said something about it irssi
 blackburn_	but I use pidgin

 n4nd0	irssi is the name of the client I use
 blackburn_	I see
 n4nd0	it's pretty cool
 n4nd0	I recommend you to try it
 n4nd0	highly customizable
 n4nd0	mine is very colorful, wanna take a look to a screenshot?
 blackburn_	how does it handle highlights?
 blackburn_	sure
 n4nd0	you can choose how to do it
 blackburn_	I like gui popups when somebody wants me :)
 n4nd0	now I have it configured to show me then on red and with a beep
 n4nd0	them*
 blackburn_	so do you have some terminal window for that?
 blackburn_	I do all the terminal stuff using guake
 n4nd0	I have it in a tab
 blackburn_	n4nd0: tab of?
 blackburn_	btw have you ever used guake?
 n4nd0	of the terminal, I have a tab for irssi
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn_	ah I see
 n4nd0	it's the first time I hear of it
 blackburn_	remember quake console
 n4nd0	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/irssipng
 blackburn_	it is the same
 blackburn_	pretty hardcore :D
 n4nd0	I will try guake, looks cool
 n4nd0	does it allow to divide the shell?
 n4nd0	I use terminator because I think that that is awesome
 blackburn_	n4nd0: split?
 blackburn_	there are tabs but no splitting
 n4nd0	look at this
 blackburn_	n4nd0: I like the opacity thing
 blackburn_	n4nd0: i.e. I press F2 and it emerges
 blackburn_	but I can see other window (irc or anything else)
 n4nd0	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11020840/terminator_splitted.png
 blackburn_	so I can see two things without any pain :D
 blackburn_	aha
 blackburn_	I am afraid it is not supported
 blackburn_	however can be emulated I think
 blackburn_	screen? or something like that
 n4nd0	no idea
 n4nd0	but I really like that option
 n4nd0	it comes handy lot of times
 blackburn_	your matlab seems to crash often
 n4nd0	yes ...
 n4nd0	it is a kind of problem with gnome I think
 blackburn_	n4nd0: TmForever, really? ;)
 n4nd0	it happens when I have it in another workspace
 n4nd0	I change constantly to others
 n4nd0	I don't even remember what that is
 n4nd0	what is it
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn_	trackmania :D
 n4nd0	ah ok
 n4nd0	I tried it :)
 n4nd0	kind of fun
 naywhayare	n4nd0: this lurker doesn't know how you can read that purple text on a black background
 n4nd0	naywhayare: I like purple :)
 blackburn_	naywhayare: I admit it seems it is the first your message there ;)
 n4nd0	haha
 naywhayare	well, I don't have anything useful to add to the conversation but if we're talking about colors and backgrounds and terminals I become useful :)
 n4nd0	naywhayare: you like that stuff too?
 naywhayare	the contrast on my monitor just must not be good enough to have the purple stand out enough
 n4nd0	I like personalization a lot
 naywhayare	haha... surprisingly yes
 naywhayare	although personalization for me means stripping out all the crap I don't care about.  across two monitors I'm looking at 4 terminals and nothing else, using fluxbox because it stays out of my way
* emrecelikten writes a note to self that he should visit this channel more
 naywhayare	I think most people would refer to me as "boring"
 n4nd0	fluxbox, that's really hardcore
 emrecelikten	I used fluxbox too, once
 emrecelikten	For a year or something
 naywhayare	I don't need much out of a window manager when all I do is open terminals and a browser, so it's a good fit for me
 n4nd0	I didn't enjoy it that much
 n4nd0	I didn't like the look and feel
 blackburn_	n4nd0: what browser do you prefer? ;)
 n4nd0	like the frames for the apps
 n4nd0	blackburn_: lynx :P
 emrecelikten	It had the feeling that you feel when you visit the empty flat that you are planning to rent
 blackburn_	oh sh
 gsomix	hackers
 naywhayare	emrecelikten: I think that's the best description I've heard of fluxbox... I'll remember that one :)
 blackburn_	n4nd0: are you for real?
 n4nd0	blackburn_: hahaha just kidding
 n4nd0	blackburn_: I like to use it sometimes for fun
 naywhayare	I actually experimented with using lynx only for browsing once (so I could live my entire life inside my screen session) but the lack of images quickly made things difficult
 emrecelikten	naywhayare: Haha, okay :)
 blackburn_	well some guys *really* use it :D
 n4nd0	blackburn_: but I normally go with chrome
 blackburn_	that's quite normal then :D
 n4nd0	blackburn_: oh didn't know about that?
 n4nd0	yeah
 n4nd0	what about you?
 n4nd0	I wouldn't mind trying sth new ;)
@sonney2k	a long way from machine learning to colors and taste :D
 emrecelikten	Isn't that sort of the ultimate goal?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: haha, actually true
 n4nd0	let's finish with some philosophy, vim or emacs? :P
 emrecelikten	gedit
 emrecelikten	:P
 n4nd0	:D
 gsomix	cat "blabla" > my_super_code.cpp
 n4nd0	gsomix: :O
 gsomix	damn
 gsomix	echo, i mean
 blackburn_	n4nd0: chrome just like you :)
 blackburn_	as for vim or emacs
 blackburn_	VIM!!!
 blackburn_	:D
 naywhayare	+1, there is no other way to edit
 blackburn_	configuring emacs whole day long is rather way of sexual activity than editing
 blackburn_	;)
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I have actually never tried emacs seriously
 n4nd0	maybe I should just to make a fair comparison
 emrecelikten	I use emacs for LaTeX editing and stuff, but I'm annoyed with it
 emrecelikten	Might try vim one day
* sonney2k started with emacs but lost a finger to it
 emrecelikten	Haha
 emrecelikten	Poor pinky
 n4nd0	haha
 emrecelikten	Well since I'm used to "crouching" with it, my pinky and emacs get along just fine
 naywhayare	ah, emacs... alt+shift+meta+footpedal+S for save
 n4nd0	:D
 blackburn_	lol
 gsomix	Stallman looks at you with disapproval.
 blackburn_	and keeps eating some foot stuff
 gsomix	lol
 blackburn_	ah bad connection
 blackburn_	wiking: hey, there?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: do you think scikits don't mind to become python_modular submodule?
 blackburn_	n4nd0: what's up with chef support?
 blackburn_	had you completed it by 18 UTC?
 n4nd0	blackburn_: eeeh mmm ... I contacted the author and he didn't agree
 wiking	blackburn_: yes
@sonney2k	blackburn_, if we have Director* support everything will be enslaved by shogun ;-)
 blackburn_	wiking: any progress on api? ;)
 wiking	blackburn_: yep just want to commit
 blackburn_	sonney2k: yes but we shall offer it to them
@sonney2k	blackburn_, I am just trying gcc-4.7
 wiking	and then i finish my proposal for gsoc
@sonney2k	the memory footprint seems to be much better
@sonney2k	as in I was able to compile w/ octave requiring less than 2GB
 blackburn_	sonney2k: that's nice
@sonney2k	vodking - better drink and sleep
 blackburn_	sonney2k: no need to sleep
 blackburn_	all one should do is to vodka
 blackburn_	I really recommend you to change your lifestyle
 blackburn_	once you get addicted to vodka things will go smoother
 blackburn_	wiking: didn't you send it already?
 blackburn_	n4nd0: convince him or bribe!
 n4nd0	blackburn_: we'll what I can do
 blackburn_	guys lets invest gsoc money to bribe chef author
 blackburn_	we really need this chef support
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn_	I can't imagine how had I lived before I tried to mix 2 kg of potato and 5 kg of string features
 wiking	blackburn_: well it's just a very shitty draft
 blackburn_	wiking: of proposal?
 blackburn_	wiking: you seems to be unhappy with something :)
 wiking	blackburn_: yeah the gsoc application
 wiking	blackburn_: too many balls and trying to joggle with them
 wiking	have 2 conf papers to finish
 wiking	as well
 blackburn_	hey will you manage to find time for gsocing?
 wiking	blackburn_: june july and august is for that
 wiking	i'm on 'holidays' for july-august
 blackburn_	what about may and june?
 wiking	meaning i can just work on gsoc
 wiking	june is clear now for me as well
 blackburn_	do not forget to mention that in the proposal
 wiking	i only have one deadline for 1st of june
 wiking	but it coincides with the gsoc
 wiking	i mean i'll use the stuff in the paper that i'm doing in gsoc
 wiking	i guess it's not a problem...
 blackburn_	that sounds ideal
 blackburn_	it is exactly that shogun made for :)
 wiking	yesterday i had a much better idea for the api
 wiking	so it'll be more c++ alike
 blackburn_	that's not a problem we are not tied to C
 wiking	i'm just wondering how swig gonna handle that
 blackburn_	wiking: what kind of pitfalls there?
 wiking	so if i have a unary function then what swig is doing with it
@sonney2k	wiking, I just compiled with clang - no issues!
 wiking	sonney2k: which version?
@sonney2k	3.0
 wiking	i'm doing 3.1
 wiking	i wonder what could be the diff between those two
@sonney2k	is that released even?
 blackburn_	wiking: what kind of unary function?
 wiking	blackburn_: are you familiar with the STL functions in <algorithm> ?
 blackburn_	not really familiar
 wiking	ok here's an example
@sonney2k	bah why does anyone want to use stl?
 blackburn_	do you want to make use of algorithms stuff?
 wiking	like for_each
 wiking	http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/for_each/
 wiking	there you define an unary function for what to do with the container's each element
 wiking	sonney2k: no it's just the idea from STL
 wiking	i won't use it
 blackburn_	okay, continue ;)
 wiking	so for the argmax function
 blackburn_	do you need to have this function available with swig?
 blackburn_	I got you, some residual function would be here or so
 wiking	i'd do the same kind of idea... that either you define your own unary function for the argmax of the latent variable
 blackburn_	or objective
 wiking	or it uses the predefined/bruteforce version of it
 wiking	so now the question is
 wiking	how does swig handle this?
 blackburn_	hmm so you want to implement this function using target interface language?
 wiking	so that you can define your own function in python for example
 blackburn_	yes there is a way
 blackburn_	gsomix is applying for idea with director classes
 blackburn_	so probably you will collaborate there a little
 blackburn_	wiking: however performance would be worse
 blackburn_	wiking: are you going to implement at least one C++ some domain specific latent svm?
@sonney2k	wiking, don't rely on it
 blackburn_	like with sliding hog windows?
@sonney2k	wiking, it can very well be that this stuff is broken in swig
 blackburn_	sonney2k: we probably should contact swig guys for that?
 wiking	blackburn_: yeah i'll create an example...
-!- flxb [~cronor@g231230100.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	and then fix it ourselves yes
 wiking	and of course the brute force version will be there as well
@sonney2k	but none of us is a swig guru
 wiking	but that's brute force, thus it might take much more time to do the optimization than with a specialized function...
@sonney2k	blackburn_, which version of gcc do you have on your machine?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: 4.6.1
@sonney2k	blackburn_, how much memory does it take to compile octave_modular w/ default settings for you?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, which gcc version do you have?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.1-9ubuntu3) 4.6.1
 blackburn_	sonney2k: I'll measure
@sonney2k	anyone using some older gcc?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: optmizations? w/ wo?
 blackburn_	ah default
@sonney2k	./configure --interfaces=octave_modular
@sonney2k	make
 blackburn_	yes I know next steps
 blackburn_	I have tried that a few times before
 gsomix	sonney2k, 4.5.2
@sonney2k	blackburn_, for me gcc4.7 / 4.6 / clang require 'just' 1.5-1.7GB of memory
@sonney2k	so I think something got improved
* sonney2k install gcc-4.4
@sonney2k	s/install/installs
@sonney2k	gsomix, if you could compile octave modular too and measure memory requirements - would be nice
@sonney2k	blackburn_, actually gcc-4.4 required 1.7-1.8GB
@sonney2k	so I guess the real change is that --datatypes configure flag
@sonney2k	where we support only a few datatypes now by default
@sonney2k	(in typemaps)
 blackburn_	sonney2k: yes probably
@sonney2k	I now compiled with ./configure --cc=gcc-4.7 --cxx=g++-4.7 --datatypes=char,bool,uint8_t,uint16_t,uint32_t,uint64_t,int8_t,int16_t,int32_t,int64_t,float32_t,float64_t,floatmax_t --prefix=/usr/local/stow/shogun-1.2.0 --ruby=ruby1.9.1 --interfaces=octave_modular
@sonney2k	and this still requires just 1.8GB
@sonney2k	so what did we change?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: ignores?
@sonney2k	ignores and moving things from .h -> .cpp ?
 blackburn_	yes
@sonney2k	such big impact?
@sonney2k	I don't know
 blackburn_	there are a lot classes in ignores
 blackburn_	sonney2k: remove ignores and check ;)
@sonney2k	this means though we should have some experimental release for debian then
@sonney2k	haha
 blackburn_	sonney2k: 1.4g
 blackburn_	sonney2k: so what is # of proposals?
@sonney2k	blackburn_, do you think we can get current git into a sane state
 blackburn_	sonney2k: what kind of sanity you mena?
@sonney2k	actually I think it is in much better state than before gsoc stars :)
@sonney2k	started
@sonney2k	blackburn_, testsuite / applications to be working again
 blackburn_	are you still dreaming about release?
 blackburn_	I need to check testsuite
@sonney2k	we need one - or would you want to work with the shogun 1.1 debian clang compiled package?
 blackburn_	no idea
 blackburn_	;)
 blackburn_	sonney2k: okay let me compare to 1.1
 blackburn_	old testsuite now acts better than on 1.1
 blackburn_	some issues were fixed
@sonney2k	cross validation broken
 blackburn_	awesome
 blackburn_	sonney2k: what caused it?
@sonney2k	ocas broken
 blackburn_	sonney2k: ocas is ok
 emrecelikten	Just submitted my hasty GSoC application
@sonney2k	no I mean these where all fixed in master
 blackburn_	ah
 blackburn_	sonney2k: btw could you please update ocas serialized output?
@sonney2k	and QDA/newtonsvm/python3 stuff is not really essential for now but it should even compile w/ python3 now
@sonney2k	blackburn_, I updated already many of the failed tests but when attempting to push the data everything was lost
@sonney2k	no idea why
 blackburn_	hmm
 blackburn_	strange
@sonney2k	gsomix, what is the python3 state btw - and the state of your proposal?
@sonney2k	blackburn_, anyway what I am saying is I would rather want to release something next week than to work with shogun 1.1
 blackburn_	sonney2k: agree
 gsomix	sonney2k, i need to check type and typemaps. it seems, everything else works
 blackburn_	sonney2k: ah yes! I'll check newton svm on my data
@sonney2k	blackburn_, yes please :)
@sonney2k	gsomix, ok then finish your proposal and then python3 stuff .. then we put this into the release too!
 gsomix	sonney2k, and i still have not corrected examples.
@sonney2k	gsomix, didn't you run 2to3?
@sonney2k	gsomix, what happened to the patch you send a week ago or so where the examples were corrected?
 blackburn_	sonney2k: I have asked you before but why we have -O9 flag?
 gsomix	sonney2k, there were errors in examples.
@sonney2k	gsomix, in how many?
