 kislay__	hi HeikoS
 khalednasr	hi
 yorkerlin	hi again
@HeikoS	very sorry for the delay and my previous issues
 Saurabh7	oh, heelllo
@HeikoS	I think the meeting can start
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: hi nice to see you
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: hi! emt will not make it
@HeikoS	lambday: dino probably also not
@HeikoS	but thats fine
@HeikoS	ok lets start
 yorkerlin	ok
@HeikoS	Welcome to our GSoC 2014 celebration meeting.
@HeikoS	We want to use this opportunity to thank everyone involved for their kick-ass work, we are extremely excited about the results this year and think that all project made significant contributions to Shogun.
@HeikoS	The community of our little ML project is ever growing, and we really hope that a few of you guys will stay around afterwards -- you are MORE than welcome.
@HeikoS	Any form of contribution is welcome: extending your/other projects, fixing bugs in your/other projects, writing more examples, blog posts, release help.
@HeikoS	Agenda for today
@HeikoS	-Project summaries (please every student/mentor pair generate some 3-5 sentences that summaries the project, including links to notebooks/examples/etc
@HeikoS	-Blog posts about GSoC
@HeikoS	-Release
@HeikoS	-What next?
@HeikoS	anyone has some other points?
@HeikoS	anyone not asleep? :D
@thoralf	Thanks you for the introduction.
 lambday	I can go first
@HeikoS	ok then, I suggest we start with the project summaries
@HeikoS	lambday: cool!
 lambday	(have some text ready)
 lambday	ok
 lambday	my project was about implementing a number of kernel hypothesis testing in shogun that would enable us to to perform a number of cutting edge kernel two-sample tests and kernel-independence tests to measure variable interactions in generic machine learning problems.
@HeikoS	thoralf: do you wanna go next with abinash_panda, jiaolong ?
 lambday	The final target was to build a flexible framework using such measures for feature selection.
 lambday	In course, we faced some difficulties while implementing the algorithms and dealt with the issues theoretically as well as implementation-wise.
 lambday	What we have presently in shogun is a framework for kernel hypothesis testing flexible enough to incorporate new measures as well as the feature selection framework that can readily use those measures as a criterion for selecting best features among all.
 lambday	A few things are yet to be completed - which includes refactoring the hypothesis framework to incorporate streaming features support for kernel independence test (something that we discovered later that we will need).
 lambday	Another thing (wiking would like this) is that we'd want our feature selection algorithm to work with sparse features as well.
@HeikoS	lambday: haha, indeed wiking would like this ! :)
 lambday	I am still working on the notebook for feature selection to be finished and hoping to push this by tomorrow.
-!- hushell [~hushell@c-98-232-237-144.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
 lambday	HeikoS: yes :P
@HeikoS	lambday: oh yeah that would be great
@HeikoS	hushell: hi!
 lambday	In future I will continue with this work and also planning to join Heiko and Dino in London for further work (which includes leaving my job which I hate currently).
 hushell	HeikoS: hey!!
* lambday done
@HeikoS	lambday: oh yeah we should talk about this a bit soon :)
 lambday	HeikoS: will do a PM
@thoralf	Next one.  Large-Scale Multilabel Project with abinash_panda.
@HeikoS	thoralf:  go for it!
@thoralf	The project aimed on large-scale multilabel classification in SHOGUN.  We succeeded in proving that we can learn the multilabel problem and implemented different approaches.
@HeikoS	(the others can prepare text already)
@thoralf	We actually didn't succedd in the "large-scale" part, but we already have some ideas ready how to improve perfomance of structured-output framework.
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f052229200.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@HeikoS	thoralf: cool, details?
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: can you be the next one? after thoralf is done?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, okie
@thoralf	Overall complexity was quite high, so I'd say it's great for SHOGUN that we can advertize multilabel classification as a new feature.
@thoralf	Details of how to improve SO framework would exceed this meeting.  I guess I'm done here.  ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: want to be next?
 Saurabh7	yup
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: can you also already prepare something?
 Saurabh7	hi guys
 Saurabh7	So as a part of my project I wrote detailed notebooks about various topics like SVMs,  regression models (http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/Regression.html), introduction to ml with shogun (http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/Introduction.html), evaluation , etc. I have tried to organize them properly so as to benefit new users.
 Saurabh7	Also  I made various changes and improvements to the web demos adding features like model selection, usage of databases and more flexibility and coverage of shoguns capabilities e.g in GPs.
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: the new web demos with GP are quite cool btw everyone,
 Saurabh7	done :)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: wiking needs to help deploy this, but you can already clone the repo and play with it locally
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: thanks! :)
 Saurabh7	eah we should update those on the website i guess
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: you should help us pushing this (otherwise it might take a while, its your work so you have a good motivation :)
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: want to be next?
 yorkerlin	still writing on it
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f052229200.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	jiaolong: ?
@thoralf	Approximate inference in SO framework (hushell and Jiaolong).  ipython notebooks:
@thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/doc/ipython-notebooks/structure/Binary_Denoising.ipynb
@thoralf	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/doc/ipython-notebooks/structure/FGM.ipynb
@thoralf	I can try a quick summary on this one as well.
@HeikoS	thoralf:  great !
@HeikoS	ok while people are writing, here is one for parijat and fernando
@thoralf	I think this project was successful as well.  The notebooks show different applications that Jiaolong made possible with our SO learning framework.
 hushell	Thanks thoralf :)
 jiaolong	Thanks
@HeikoS	Parijat: "The summary of the work done in Fundamental ML algorithms in the second half of GSoC is as follows :1. Implement KD-Trees and Ball trees for fast NN search.2. Implement kernel density estimation using single tree as well as dual tree approach.3. Implement generic EM and generic mixture model classes. The CGaussian class needs to be refactored and other classes like that for multinomial distribution need to be implemented so that this whol
@HeikoS	With orientations and seminars everyday, I am finding much less time to spend on Shogun these days. But as things settle down a bit, I should be able to contribute more often. "
 jiaolong	There is anoter one for scene segmentation: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/Jiaolong/95633b7efd64bbd096f2
@HeikoS	everyone check out parijats stuff, very nice!
@thoralf	jiaolong: Can you name the three (?) approximations you implemented?
@HeikoS	jiaolong, thoralf, these notebooks should be merged asap btw
 jiaolong	HeikoS: yes, I am just coming back from two confernece, will finish them soon
@HeikoS	jiaolong: great!
 hushell	We still have several PRs left, will be done shortly
@HeikoS	hushell: great, yeah that should be done soon, before we forget
@HeikoS	but lets talk about that later,
 jiaolong	HeikoS: this summer we just finish two inference algs: graph cuts, max-product LP relaxation
 jiaolong	HeikoS: yeah
 jiaolong	I would like to stay in shougun to improve current algorithms and also implements new algorithms.
 jiaolong	As I am also doing working on domain adaptation, I would like to contribute to domain adaptation projects in shogun as well.
 hushell	HeikoS: I'll keep them in mind :)
@HeikoS	jiaolong: you are super welcome to do so. lambday just joined the core-dev team as you know :)
@HeikoS	jiaolong: great!, in particular your research paper code might be useful
@HeikoS	hushell: nice :)
@HeikoS	ok cool all done?
@HeikoS	yorkerlin?
@HeikoS	kislay__: ?
 kislay__	yeah ready.
@HeikoS	kislay__: go!
 kislay__	The project aimed at making a lucid interfacing between Shogun and OpenCV
 kislay__	The first half consisted of integrating OpenCV's Mat datastructure with Shogun's SGMatrix. Did some changes in the FisherLDA class for implementing fisherfaces face rec. directly.
 kislay__	The second half consisted mainly of showing cool computer vision applications using Shogun and OpenCV through notebooks. It comprised of Automatic Number Plate Recognition, Scene classification using SIFT, Active Appearance Model along with markdown documentations showcasing the C++ integration. This half was more fun as it consisted of mainly implementations.
 kislay__	I realized that there's humongous possibility of doing things in Shogun related to ML and CV. I have a thesis this year and was really thinking of doing something that not only helps Shogun but also spruce up my thesis. I haven't decided the topic yet so will love to get your inputs for this.
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@f052229200.adsl.alicedsl.de] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
 kislay__	done i think.
@HeikoS	kislay__: great!
@HeikoS	kislay__: what about your open PRs?
@HeikoS	kislay__: you sent an email on thise
@HeikoS	we should try to get them merged soon, you should push everyone to do this :)
 kislay__	yeah. I have to take care of some of them.
@HeikoS	ok good!
@HeikoS	so next one: yorkerlin
 yorkerlin	ok
 yorkerlin	The GSoC project I implemented several variational methods for GPC. The variational methods include: approximating the posterior covariance matrix exactly (for accuracy) assuming artificial structure of the posterior covariance matrix (for speed) However, there methods still NOT scalable to big data. I still working on refining the notebook but will attempt to finish it this week.
 yorkerlin	The next step is to implement large scale methods via stochastic variational approach and variable selection approach. (already read some papers and will implement them this year) The final goal is to extend to latent GP models and hierarchical latent models (eg, correlated topic models).
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: yeah the notebook updates are important, please push them
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: awesome, looking super forward to you to implement those things!
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: we will talk to emt about all that
 yorkerlin	ok
@HeikoS	I might submit a nips workshop on this
@HeikoS	we will see
@HeikoS	ok, did we forget any project?
 yorkerlin	cool!
@HeikoS	lambday, lisitsyn ?
 khalednasr	HeikoS, I
@HeikoS	khalednasr: ah yes
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	khalednasr: go for it :)
 khalednasr	I'll go :)
 khalednasr	The goal of the project was to implement the basic deep learning algorithms. The following was implemented: Standard neural networks, onvolutional nets, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Deep Belief Networks, Deep autoencoders and Convolutional autoencoders.
 khalednasr	As documentation, I wrote notebooks and c++ examples that cover all the algorithms in the neuralnets module.
 khalednasr	I also did some work refactoring the linalg library and adding most of the methods needed by the neuralnets module to it.
 khalednasr	What remains to be done is modifying the neuralnets module to make it use the linalg library, so that it'll support running neural nets on the GPU. I'll try to find time to work on that sometime soon.
@HeikoS	khalednasr: do the things already work again linalg?
@HeikoS	khalednasr: that would be *amazing*
@lisitsyn	yeah that's the crucial thing
@HeikoS	khalednasr:  in fact, if we get lambday's parallel/distributed framework running, we can parallelise things on GPU clusters
@HeikoS	khalednasr: (you need some minor refactoring for that only)
 khalednasr	HeikoS, yeah that'd be good
@HeikoS	khalednasr: but very exciting, I think we should aim to reproduce a large benchmark result, I can donate some time on a GPU cluster
@HeikoS	khalednasr: so if you are interested, we can make Shogun be able to do that
@HeikoS	khalednasr: but linalg is first
 khalednasr	yeah
@HeikoS	khalednasr: can you also post your notebook links=?
@HeikoS	ok, so I guess thats it, any comments?
@HeikoS	if not, the second part of the meeting is quick: just me talking about a few things, please stop me and get a discussion going, if you feel like it
@HeikoS	So second part of agenda:
@HeikoS	-Blog posts about GSoC
@HeikoS	We would like to encourage everyone of you to blog about GSoC.
@HeikoS	This is a great way for us to get publicity.
@HeikoS	It helps us doing the GSoC again next year: It helps us getting in, it makes more students apply, etc.
@HeikoS	We would be EXTREMELY thankful if you could produce something *this* week.
@HeikoS	(or next)
@HeikoS	It does not have to be super polished - just write about your experience, and present some of your work.
@HeikoS	social media would also be fine
@HeikoS	even if just a few sentences
@HeikoS	We would like to collect all posts and reference from a big one that we are writing.
@HeikoS	The plan is to get it featured at http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/
@HeikoS	See also the github issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2523
@HeikoS	comments?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, thoralf, sonney2k, wiking, abinash_panda, hushell, khalednasr, kislay__, lambday, pickle27, Saurabh7, yorkerlin ?
 yorkerlin	cool. will working on it next week since the notebook job.
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: as said, it doesnt need to be super advanced
@HeikoS	yorkerlin: just some content on Shogun and GSoC
@HeikoS	Ok then next point! (wiking would be helpful here)
@HeikoS	RELEASE. Shogun 3.4
@thoralf	HeikoS: Fine with writing a blog post here.
@thoralf	HeikoS: One per project or a big one?
@HeikoS	thoralf: cool, please share the link once done!
@thoralf	LOL.
@HeikoS	thoralf: both (coordinate the big one with me)
@thoralf	HeikoS: Current status is "I like the idea" ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: Ill share a doc for the big one, but a small one on the projects would also be cool
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	thoralf: greatly appreciated!
@HeikoS	Release:
@HeikoS	We aim for a release ASAP to put all your great work to the world (really important, and cool 8-) ).
@HeikoS	For that, we need your help.
@HeikoS	HELP
@HeikoS	:)
@HeikoS	First, make sure your project is in a release-able state (people will judge you on the quality of your work, so better clean again ;) ).
 hushell	also on personal webpages, facebook, twitter, google+ will be nice ;)
@HeikoS	hushell: yes !
@HeikoS	Second, we got a list of things to solve for the release that are general minor (and major) issues all around Shogun.
@HeikoS	Feel free to help us hacking on any of those.
@HeikoS	Here is a list https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/milestones/Shogun%203.4
@HeikoS	Also this means: FEATURE FREEZE until we release.
@HeikoS	Please do not send patches that extend Shogun before release, but rather fix some open problem. We count on you :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, thoralf, sonney2k, wiking, abinash_panda, hushell, khalednasr, kislay__, lambday, pickle27, Saurabh7, yorkerlin we need all the hands we can for a release, any comments on that?
@HeikoS	if not, lets go to the last point of the meeting
@thoralf	HeikoS: Please let's start with a milestone on github.
 lambday	HeikoS: my first goal is to finish the notebook - then will write a NEWS about linalg which will be useful for the release
 hushell	what's the timeline for 3.4?
@HeikoS	hushell: it would be good this month
@HeikoS	thoralf: that link is a milestone
 lambday	HeikoS: also, was discussing something with lisitsyn about something - will discuss with that issue with you
@HeikoS	thoralf: feel free to extend (there is an old clean-up release milestone)
@thoralf	HeikoS: :)
@HeikoS	thoralf: but only feasible stuff
@HeikoS	we tend to put too much
@HeikoS	this release is really GSoC feature, so just a few things that should work
 hushell	HeikoS: ok, the left behind PRs have to be hurried up
@HeikoS	mainly binary packages, warnings, severe bugs, build, etc
@HeikoS	hushell: yeah exactly
@HeikoS	all PRs should be closed
@HeikoS	hushell: I mean merged
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@HeikoS	lambday: release related
@HeikoS	?
@thoralf	HeikoS: Binary package for OSX shouldn't be part of the milestone.  This issue may explode. ;)
 hushell	HeikoS: got it
@HeikoS	thoralf: yep, I agree, feel free to remove it
 lambday	HeikoS: not exactly ... but future shogun goal related
@HeikoS	lambday: ok
@HeikoS	so really main focus is the release now
@HeikoS	the world shall know about the great stuff we did
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, thoralf, sonney2k, wiking, abinash_panda, hushell, khalednasr, kislay__, lambday, pickle27, Saurabh7, yorkerlin there is for example the task to remove all warnings from the buildbot
@HeikoS	very easy, but lot of work
@HeikoS	mostly documenting functions, fixing math, etc
@HeikoS	static warnings another one
@HeikoS	ok if no comments, then the last part of the agenda:
@HeikoS	WHATS NEXT? (after release)
@HeikoS	Stammtisch: We would love to get the Stammtisch going again.
@HeikoS	This is every Monday evening, and everyone is welcome to talk about Shogun, and other things.
@HeikoS	I will send emails about this. It would be great if you guys would hang out and if we get a discussion going on a regular basis.
@HeikoS	comments on Stammtisch?
@HeikoS	If not, the very last point
@HeikoS	Finally, GSoC brought a few things to light, that would be great to continue working on.
@HeikoS	In particular, the linalg framework would be a great great improvement if being used globally in all Shogun.
@HeikoS	khalednasr, lambday, lisitsyn you guys shoud lead that btw
@HeikoS	Everyone could help pushing this via adding new operations to the interface, and using them from algorithms.
@HeikoS	I will soon add github issues on this.
@lisitsyn	yeah I'll try to join that process again
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: its not really about adding operations to the interface, and start porting our algorithms to that
@HeikoS	Any other thoughts ideas? What do you think are things that would be good to work on this winter (before next GSoC)
@lisitsyn	we need GWoC
@lisitsyn	:D
@thoralf	HeikoS: Regarding what's next.
@thoralf	1. Improving usability for "new" users.  Providing installation scripts/binary packages for common platforms (Ubuntu/Debian, MacOSX, ?).
@thoralf	Maybe this can be done after GSoC release within another release.  I created a milestone 3.4.1 for this.  This is open for discussion and changes.
@thoralf	2. Making SHOGUN more scalable (multilabel project showed that we still don't scale well).
@thoralf	2a. If we don't know how far we scale try "bigger" examples, not only small toy data sets.  (Not neccessarily from tests)
@thoralf	2b. Investigate bordercases which don't scale and try to optimize SHOGUN on them.
@HeikoS	thoralf: great points, maybe also add this to the shogun hack agenda
@HeikoS	thoralf: great ideas,
@thoralf	Link?
@HeikoS	thoralf: I agree we really want to make shogun large scale
@HeikoS	thoralf: we should have github issues for all this, and link them to the wiki
@thoralf	HeikoS: Okay, regarding 1. we're on the same page.
@HeikoS	thoralf:  its here: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki
@HeikoS	thoralf: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Roadmap-Shogun-2015-hack
@thoralf	Regarding 2. we first should create awareness in the core team to encourage people to benchmark and optimize.
@HeikoS	thoralf: very good point,
@thoralf	(Not stopping after successful toy examples.)
@HeikoS	gunnar and me talked a bit about that in fact
@HeikoS	thoralf: yeah. totally
@HeikoS	thoralf: and stop adding new methods, the red line for the next year should be improving existing things
@HeikoS	i.e. faster/stable/usable
@HeikoS	thoralf: would be great if you could document your thouhts, that makes it easier
@HeikoS	thoralf: maybe you have an idea for a kind of development guideline that ensures scalability ? (like we did with the unit tests back then) ?
@HeikoS	lambday: you also had a point on whats next?
@HeikoS	I guess we can close the meeting and then continue discussing
@HeikoS	If there are no other points, we would like to heartly thank you all again for your great work. We love you all and hopefully see you around :)
@HeikoS	Meeting is closed.
 lambday	HeikoS: something that I thought of while trying to refactoring hypothesis framework
 lambday	HeikoS: in many many places in shogun, we need to rely on some combinatorial combinations of componets
 lambday	for which we presently mostly rely on virtual calls
 lambday	I was thinking if we can do better than that
@thoralf	HeikoS: It's hard to automate benchmarking.  I think people should try to apply their stuff to bigger data and then use profiling to find "hotspots".
 lambday	the alternative being relying on highly templated design
@thoralf	Then start optimizing the hotspots.
 lambday	the only issue with this is that we might have difficulties while exposing to modular interaces
@HeikoS	thoralf: yeah, but I mean something like, you always have to include a benchmark or so, because people quickly forget those things
 lambday	for that I was thinking that maybe we can use CSGObjects as wrappers mostly
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, so whats the gain there? speed?
 lambday	and send the most time consuming parts to c++ internals
 lambday	HeikoS: exactly
@HeikoS	lambday: in fact, that could be great as a motivation to clean shoguns internals up
 lambday	HeikoS: just have a look at this simple example - https://gist.github.com/lambday/73b9e68ec08e2da25967
@HeikoS	lambday: would you mind documenting this a bit? like basic idea, example, what has to be done, etc?
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: and put it in the wiki, I mean, write a gitrhub issue and link it in the wiki for the hack
 lambday	HeikoS: I was already planning to write something on this on the refactoring hypothesis frameworks issue
 lambday	HeikoS: for example, it sucks that we can't use sparse features with gaussian kernels currently
 lambday	because using existing stuffs its tough to reimplement that

 lambday	I think we can do better
@HeikoS	lambday: so thats one order of magnitude?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
@HeikoS	lambday: wow, that actually would mean we could fe-factor a lot of the internals right?
 lambday	HeikoS: also, plugin framework that lisitsyn proposed is essential I think
@HeikoS	lambday: these things are the ones we should do within the next year, really get Shoguns c++ code modernized, and faster this way
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah just an idea though
@lisitsyn	guys as for plugins framework
@HeikoS	lambday: also we can think about many existing problems
@HeikoS	as serialisation etc
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah
@lisitsyn	I need some help with it I think
@HeikoS	lambday: can you write a little motivation for all this?
@HeikoS	so that everyone is aware?
@HeikoS	lambday: this is also super useful for grant applications (like for the hack
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: same there,
 lambday	so maybe we can spend until next GSoC more on these engineering issues than ML stuffs
@HeikoS	lambday: totally
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: same with what? :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I am willing to help
@lisitsyn	ok just a few first steps then
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would be good to write down your ideas in a compressed way, and then link them in the wiki I put up
 lambday	HeikoS: lisitsyn will have to help in this :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: very useful for getting money for the hack (if we have discussions and concrete ideas)
@lisitsyn	lets we three HeikoS lambday agree on naming
@lisitsyn	then I put it into shougn
@lisitsyn	as shogun org
@lisitsyn	at github
@lisitsyn	we will have some kind of separate project :D
@lisitsyn	so if anyone wants some kind of plugin based swig library - just use our core thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: everyone wants this
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: you know, at the meeting in NY, everyone was jealous that we can do the interface thing
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: would be good to have a separate project, I already talked to s?ren about this last year
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: please write down
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: all good for the hack
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: we can do all this in a week
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no I just propose to move it into github org already

@lisitsyn	wiki is ok as well
@lisitsyn	but I want to push it a bit other way as well
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: just for internal synchronisation etc
@lisitsyn	I need a name :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: lambday:
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I will think of something
@lisitsyn	currently its aer :D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  applications of this are huge, stan people for example want this too
 lambday	we gotta be the best in the field, men!!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  john langford told me: "Basically you have everything that every other project would like to have"
 lambday	lisitsyn: name... bad person to ask
@HeikoS	lambday: yes sir!

-!- Mathnerd314 [~quassel@dsl-206-53-27-58.den.pcisys.net] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: please write a bit about the general idea in the wiki, cannot say that often enough :)
@HeikoS	aer ++ haha
@HeikoS	c++^2
 lambday	latin for air, eh? :P
-!- khalednasr [~k.nasr92@41.69.136.192] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@HeikoS	lambday: I will check your c++ listings
 lambday	lisitsyn: so we'll start a whole new branch of shogun, refactoring bits and pieces as we go along
@thoralf	HeikoS: I put my ideas to the hack page.
@lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/aer
@lisitsyn	ok guys
@lisitsyn	ohh it is outdated :D
 lambday	HeikoS: just a small example that is - to demonstrate that we can do better than java style interfaces using c++ templates :D
-!- kislay__ [~Abhijeet@117.239.94.112] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
@lisitsyn	ok guys be back later
@lisitsyn	I'll try to update you on this thing
 lambday	I am pretty psyched to get these stuffs working before the hackathon
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool!
@HeikoS	see you :)
@HeikoS	lambday: awesome :)
@HeikoS	yeah me too
 lambday	and there we can integrate the whole thing and have a super cool release
@HeikoS	I am psyched about the hackathon
@HeikoS	just need to get the money
@HeikoS	and for that we need documented discussions
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah agreed
 lambday	absolutely
@HeikoS	lambday: ok cool
@HeikoS	lambday: gotta go now, lets keep the stammtisch going, we should discuss those stuff at least once a week
 lambday	I'm gonna start this discussion by putting a few of the ideas for hypothesis testing framework
 lambday	HeikoS: absolutely
@HeikoS	lambday: sweet
@HeikoS	lambday: I will be around a bit more from now on
 lambday	if we have a working demo inside shogun that we can do this - then that's a good point to start future discussions
@HeikoS	I agree
 lambday	HeikoS: me too
@HeikoS	lambday: like the linalg stuff
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah
 lambday	thanks to khaled for the brilliant stuffs he added
@HeikoS	lambday: +1
@HeikoS	khaled++
@HeikoS	lambday: I gotta go now (dinner)
@HeikoS	lambday: lets chat this week!
@HeikoS	I will be online!
 lambday	HeikoS: alright
 lambday	HeikoS: I'll try to chalk out a few things by then
@HeikoS	lambday: cool
@HeikoS	lambday: lets talk at stammtisch on monday eve latest
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.
@thoralf	Bye!
