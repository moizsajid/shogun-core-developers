 gsomix	hi
 wiking	ho
 blackburn	n4nd0: so what about risks with hm?
 blackburn	can I help you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have to take a look to the PR that wiking did
 blackburn	well he just put risk to so model
 n4nd0	for what I undestood
 n4nd0	it should work with that
 n4nd0	do you remember the name of the PR?
 blackburn	not really
 n4nd0	has it already been merged?
 n4nd0	got it
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/719
 blackburn	yes sure
 n4nd0	I am going to issue a new PR soon and later I will check that
 n4nd0	this is a small one
 n4nd0	I just added a new Evaluation class, StructuredAccuracy, to compute accuracy for structured problems
 blackburn	good thing to have
 n4nd0	definitely
 wiking	what's with the risk fuction then?
 wiking	*function?
 wiking	blackburn: merge my last pr please
 wiking	n4nd0: ping me when u have 10 mins to chat
 blackburn	wiking: CIA died - it is already merged
 n4nd0	wiking: now is good, tell me
 wiking	blackburn: lol ok
 wiking	n4nd0: ok brb in 1 min
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	n4nd0: i need to redesign or soemting structuredmodel
 wiking	but i need your input/consent
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	btw
 wiking	check my last PR
 n4nd0	I have not really looked at the PR yet
 n4nd0	give some more time then
 wiking	i've change how PSI is calculated in latent
 wiking	as this is the only way we can support sparse features
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/741
 wiking	as the SGVector<float64_t> psi (...) both in Structured and LatentModel
 wiking	could not support sparse features
 wiking	ok i'll be back in 1 min
 n4nd0	wiking: but those changes are just in LatentModel
 n4nd0	wiking, blackburn: I am checking PR 719, I thought that the idea was to move the risk function to the StructuredModel rather than to the children
 n4nd0	as I see there it is not implemented in CStructuredModel but in CMulticlassModel
 blackburn	how can that be implemented in structured model?
 n4nd0	do you remember that conversation we had at midnight some days ago?
 n4nd0	I think that the conclusion there was that the risk function was dependent on the argmax and the psi
 wiking	n4nd0: for now yes
 wiking	n4nd0: that risk function only valid for Multiclass case
 wiking	that's why it's in multiclass
 n4nd0	but apart from that, the definition is genereal
 blackburn	n4nd0: no, subgrad is not general
 wiking	n4nd0: the risk fucntion for instance for SOlatent svm would be different
 n4nd0	blackburn: wasn't it too in the definition we saw in that thesis?
 n4nd0	wiking: that's why I think it should be virtual, but in StructuredModel
 blackburn	yes, for some models it is
 shogun-buildbot_	build #392 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/392  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	n4nd0: and about the psi function: i've just done it in latent model since i don't know how it would effect SO at the moment
 n4nd0	wiking: ok
 wiking	n4nd0: it is virtual in structuredModel
 n4nd0	wiking: let me show you the reference we were talking about
 n4nd0	well I think there is a mail with that
 wiking	n4nd0: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/719/files#L18R228
 blackburn	n4nd0: I don't mind it to be general
 blackburn	but if there is loss of efficiency I don't mind to have some duplicated code
 wiking	somebody broke java modular :)
 wiking	i guess it's heiko
 n4nd0	http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~chteo/pub/Teo10_phdthesis.pdf
 blackburn	I mean if {argmax+subgrad} in multiclass is more efficient than virtual one - we should go this way
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 n4nd0	blackburn: why should it be more efficient that way?
 wiking	n4nd0: which page?
 blackburn	wiking: Appendix 1
 n4nd0	wiking: equations A.1 and A.8, pages 103 and 105
 n4nd0	they are the contribution in the risk of one training example and the subgradient, respectively
 wiking	ok
 wiking	but isn't this application specific?
 wiking	i mean what i understood from uricamic's solver
 wiking	it pretty much lambda*||w||_2^2 + Risk
 wiking	i mean it solves this
 blackburn	hahaha I just noticed the author's name
 wiking	and as you can see from the risk function of MulticlassModel... it pretty much works only if your SO problem is a multiclass problem
 blackburn	bad bad word in the middle
 n4nd0	wiking: aren't the application speficic parts only in the argmax and the psi?
 wiking	n4nd0: in that risk funciton no
 wiking	*function
 blackburn	n4nd0: so you want to implement subgrad in independent fashion as well
 blackburn	right?
 wiking	it loops through the various classes
 n4nd0	wiking: in uricamic's one?
 wiking	n4nd0: yes
 n4nd0	wiking: can you point out for me the loops you mean? lines?
 wiking	line 181
 wiking	in MulticlassModel.cpp
 n4nd0	wiking: it looks to me that this part is the argmax
 wiking	well if yes then chuck it out :)
 wiking	and replace it with argmax :)
 wiking	and see if we can get further with the story
 n4nd0	hehe I guess I should read it completely first
 wiking	and move the risk function in structredmodel ;)
 wiking	R({\bf w}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left[ \ell(y_i, y) * + \langle {\bf w}, \Psi(x_i, y) - \Psi(x_i, y_i)  \rangle  \right]
 wiking	this is what the code does apparently
 wiking	(see the doxygen for virtual float64_t risk(float64_t* subgrad, float64_t* W, TMultipleCPinfo* info=0); in MulticlassModel.h
 wiking	but let me know when u r through this one as i have other concerns :)
 n4nd0	tell me about them :)
 wiking	heheh so ok the following is the story
 wiking	i need to be able to chuck in extra variables for StructuredModel
 wiking	for delta_loss
 wiking	and get_joint_vector...
 wiking	which would mean that i need to change the function arguments in StructuredModel
 wiking	but that won't work  :)
 wiking	i mean i need something like this for example for delta loss
 wiking	loss(y, yhat, hhat) instead of loss(y1, y2)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I thought of that
 wiking	get_joint_feature_vector should be
 n4nd0	my idea was to put that method in StructuredModel too
 wiking	get_joint_feature_vector(feat_index, structureddata y, latentdata h)
 blackburn	n4nd0: btw about coffin integration
 blackburn	subgrad of models (by Teo)
 blackburn	is 0 + \phi(x,\overline{y})
 n4nd0	wiking: just put them in the StructuredModel
 blackburn	- \phi(x,y)
 wiking	n4nd0: how? :)
 blackburn	I mean it is two add_to_dense_vec operations
 wiking	i can do something like: get_joint_feature_vector(feat_index, structureddata y, latentdata h = NULL)
 n4nd0	wiking: that's why I didn't do delta_loss and get_joint_feature_vector pure virtual, but unimplemented
 wiking	and same for delta_loss
 n4nd0	exactly, that's the spirit :)
 wiking	?
 wiking	no comprende
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	what is the problem of making new methods?
 n4nd0	we have a delta_loss(y1,y2)
 n4nd0	put another one there delta_loss(y,yhat,hhat)
 blackburn	wiking: can you convert it to sth like 'add_joint_feature_vector_to_dense_vec'? :)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #393 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/393  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 wiking	blackburn: which where?
 blackburn	wiking: I mean now you are using get_joint_feature_vector
 wiking	n4nd0: and who will call it in your Primal solver?
 blackburn	oh I will wait you to finish :)
 wiking	blackburn: which class r u talking about
 blackburn	wiking: let me check last pr again
 n4nd0	wiking: aham, so you would like to use the primal solver for your latent problems directly
 wiking	yes
 wiking	as well as the dual solver by uricamic
 n4nd0	wiking: aham, are you sure it can be done like that?
 wiking	well the only difference is
 wiking	how you calculate the delta loss and the psi
 wiking	i.e. psi is based on x,y,h
 wiking	and not only on x,y
 wiking	same with the delta loss
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	see here:
 n4nd0	but even if you include a new parameter latentdata h = NULL
 n4nd0	how do you plan to make the difference between executing for latent or not?
 n4nd0	some kind of boolean member?
 wiking	n4nd0: no
 wiking	i mean from the fucntion you can tell whether the func arg is set or not
 wiking	right?
 wiking	btw i can see that you use only argmax directly from PrimalMosek
 wiking	right?
 n4nd0	yes, I think so
 n4nd0	wiking: and yes, you are right about the thing of the func arg; I am king of retarded...
 n4nd0	kind* of
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	then maybe this would work
 wiking	but the stupid thing is
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	somehow i wanted to hide this behind the function if you know what i mean
 wiking	so that things are not passed via the function arg
 wiking	rather you just give an index or something
 wiking	and everything else is behind the scenes
 wiking	blackburn: ok check it again
 wiking	n4nd0: but maybe it'll work what i'm thinking of now
 blackburn	check what?
 wiking	as really delta_loss and get_joint_feature_vector is being called in your argmax
 wiking	blackburn: last pr
 wiking	blackburn: you were about to comment there something
 blackburn	I'm kind of lost there
 wiking	blackburn: this one: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/741
 wiking	?
 wiking	in this one?
 blackburn	no in general
 blackburn	so you compute dense features
 blackburn	according to position of window
 blackburn	right?
 wiking	blackburn: mmm don't mix it now with the application :)))
 blackburn	but is it so?
 wiking	blackburn: yeah there is so like that
 wiking	*it is like that
 blackburn	it sounds like memory eating thing
 n4nd0	wiking: ok, so tell me if so when you have ready with what that you were thinking of
 wiking	n4nd0: well now i'm thinking of creating a class that is actually a direct inheritance of StructuredModel
 wiking	n4nd0: and add there non-virtual functions for delta_loss and get_psi
 wiking	n4nd0: and the argmax and basically then the argmax will call the right functions with the right amount of arguments
 wiking	and then for now i don't touch the StructuredModel
 wiking	and if that one works out then we'll see later about how we could simplify the thing
 wiking	i have no better idea now :S
 n4nd0	it looks like a good idea to me
 n4nd0	probably those two classes could be merged once we check it works
 n4nd0	there the PR goes :)
 blackburn	??????
 blackburn	merged
 n4nd0	thank you :)
 wiking	cia bot die!
 wiking	and it did apparently

 blackburn	n4nd0: did you read about CRFs before? is it's argmax hard to implement?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I have read something about CRFs ues
 n4nd0	yes*
 n4nd0	I don't think the argmax is something fancier than Viterbi
 blackburn	I was pretty excited when I saw CRF based segmentation
 n4nd0	BUT the thing is that I don't know how CRFs would fit into our SO framework
 n4nd0	why?
 blackburn	why not
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	what is so different between HM and CRFs?
 n4nd0	in the paper I read the way of training had nothing to do with the one for HM-SVM I know
 blackburn	hmm I see

 os253	Hi puffin444
 puffin444	hello os253
 os253	is now good for you?I am around all evening.
 puffin444	yes now is good if its good for you
 blackburn	oh gaussian team in da house
 puffin444	yes indeed :)
 os253	yes, fine here.
 os253	:-)
 blackburn	tell me - how much effort is to add GP classifiers?
 puffin444	honestly not sure. I would have to check GPML.
 puffin444	Shouldnt require too much though
 os253	How far is the Laplace code? If that works it's just another likelihood function...
 puffin444	The laplace code is pretty much done and ready to be merged wt any time.
 blackburn	about your PR
 puffin444	yes?
 blackburn	puffin444: you merged it in some kind of broken way - can you clean it up?
 puffin444	uh oh what's the problem?
 blackburn	os253: have you seen puffin444 PR? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/707
 blackburn	puffin444: latest commits include some heiko's ones..
 blackburn	however may be it is not worth it
 os253	Then it should be easy. blackburn: do you think classification is useful? Generaly speaking: gps are not that great for classifcation or at least not better than SVMs.
 blackburn	os253: I am pretty lame in everything about GPs :)
 blackburn	os253: I am kind of chris widmer representer :D
 os253	i see
 puffin444	os253 all the main features mentioned in the project plan have been merged or are ready to be merged
 blackburn	puffin444: can you change namespace in brent method source?
 puffin444	At this point any additional feature should be a fairly easy task
 blackburn	puffin444: I have two general issues I think would be cool to solve
 blackburn	first is rather mandatory - FITC eigen members
 puffin444	yes?
 blackburn	and second is some alternative to nlopt in gradient model selection
 blackburn	no idea if you have time for that :)
 puffin444	Well gradient model selection is pretty general
 blackburn	eigen member is serious issue we need to resolve before release
 blackburn	members*
 puffin444	What about FITC eigen membes? Is that the map<vecrorxd> we discussed earlier?
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	so please focus on that before 1st of sept
 puffin444	okay. So replace those Vectorxd members with map?
 blackburn	no, replace it with SGMatrix and SGVector
 blackburn	and map in your code
 os253	what is the issue with eigen members?
 blackburn	os253: eigen should not be included and/or exposed in headers to avoid additional dependency
 puffin444	in .h or also .cpp?
 blackburn	puffin444: I think I have an idea
 blackburn	I am going to add as_eigen method
 blackburn	to both sgvector and sgmatrix
 os253	I see
 blackburn	which returns eigen analogue of the matrix
 blackburn	or the vector
 blackburn	see what I mean?
 puffin444	yes.
 blackburn	oops not possible
 blackburn	same reason
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I missed that
 blackburn	you have to map it manually
 blackburn	okay just change it to sg* and map in your code before use
 puffin444	Okay. Can I still use eigen vectors directly in cpp files?
 blackburn	yes sure
 puffin444	os253 I am working ona tutorial pagefor gps
 os253	yes, that would be great. I have looked through the PR yesterday. It seems like a good mix of sticking to the GPML code and adapting it to your framework.
 blackburn	puffin444: Map<MatrixXd> (m_some_matrix.matrix,m_some_matrix.num_rows,m_some_matrix.num_cols);
 blackburn	that's what you would have to do
 os253	I am wondering how to best make sure it will be picked up. What examples do you currently have?
 blackburn	err missed name
 os253	It looks like tutorials and examples are the main thing to add.
 puffin444	I have examples for every msjor feature under libshogun
 os253	Perhaps the
 puffin444	I also have a basic graphical example in python
 puffin444	All the main features have been integrated into the modular interface
 os253	I'd vote for a python example, just a single one where you use standard GP, GP with ficti (also visusalizing the location of the learnt inducing points).
 blackburn	puffin444: btw are you going to research GPs further?
 os253	Lastly the same with student-T. Something like that.
 puffin444	for graduate school?
 blackburn	no idea, in general
 puffin444	I hope to stay and contribute to shogun and flesh the gp code out a bit
 blackburn	cool
 puffin444	os253 that should beeasyto do.
 os253	 puffin444: you almost should stay on, having coded up this chunk is substantial. From that basis it would be easy to carry out novel directions that are more research like.
 os253	Great, I think a visual python example would be very useful to have.
 puffin444	Yes I could just build onto the current one I have.
 puffin444	blackburn, is it possible that the current pr be merged? The only reason I ask is that I have to fix a ton of conflicts each time I have to rebase.
 os253	that would be great.
 blackburn	puffin444: ah sure I forgot
 blackburn	merged
 blackburn	CIA died so no message
 puffin444	os253, Do you have any orther questions/concerns?
 os253	I have a list of small things, but perhaps I can just email them. For example: choice of the number of inducing points.
 os253	You currently take the same approach than GPML, right? I.e. they are fixed.
 puffin444	fixed at what point? They are chosen before hyperparameter learning,
 os253	Or do you have code for choosing an apprpriate number? A simple heuristic may be good enough.
 puffin444	Oh yes in that case they are fixed.

 os253	Perhaps one could add this to a python demo for large data. Do you have a suitable datasets with thousands of data points to illustrate the use of the sparse approximation?

 puffin444	No I do not.
 os253	What datasets are you using at the moment?
 puffin444	A simple 4 point dataset I use to compare with gpml.
 os253	Ok. I can send you some suggestion.
 puffin444	I did this to ensure the hyperparameter learning came up with consistent parameters across gpml and shogun.
 puffin444	yes.
 os253	Perhaps best to pick some one can download from a script to avoid having to add it to the repository.
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey there
 os253	It would be useful to have a script that can be run, downloads the datasets and processes it alongside some plots.
 n4nd0	blackburn: when someone publishes a paper, don't you think that the code and data they have used for their results should be provided?
 os253	I'll send you a list of datasets that are public and can be downloaded.
 puffin444	I could try that.
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am quite surprised that I don't manage to find anything about it for the papers I am reading, maybe I am searching wrong :S
 puffin444	thanks
-!- gsomix_ [~gsomix@178.45.41.90] has joined #shogun
 os253	Yes, that would be great. Thanks. I'll send this by tomorrow.

 os253	If you are around tomorrow we can briefly chat then.
 os253	I am online all day but not necessarily on IRC.
 puffin444	sorry blackburn. It looks like I forgot a HAVE_EIGEN somewhere
 blackburn	n4nd0: yeah kind of open source science
 blackburn	I believe most cases of not available code means NO CODE
 blackburn	and no research
 n4nd0	blackburn: but how can it be possible that there is no code?
 blackburn	I mean it could turn to be a false research
 n4nd0	I mean, the results that are published must be checked somehow!
 blackburn	:D
 puffin444	os253, I unfortunately will not be available tomorrow.
 blackburn	no they are not checked by editors
 n4nd0	blackburn: really?
 blackburn	n4nd0: well they are checked for consistency or so
 blackburn	but nobody will try to run your code
 os253	puffin444: ok -then let's do via email and or at a later time.
 puffin444	ok.
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am really surprised
 n4nd0	when I start writing papers
 n4nd0	I will offer a link to the code!
 n4nd0	hehe
 blackburn	yeah that's how it should be
 blackburn	puffin444: can you fix it?
 puffin444	I will try.
 blackburn	okay thanks
 puffin444	Can't do it immediately, but i can to it in a few hours
 blackburn	I will do then
 blackburn	puffin444: oh.. you added new methods with eigen return type
 puffin444	uh oh. How can i resolve it?
 blackburn	the same - return sgvectors/sgmatrices
 blackburn	and then map
 puffin444	ok. will do.
 blackburn	I wish we had some solution for that but I think depending on eigen is wrong
 puffin444	ok.
 os253	blackburn: the more code requirew
 os253	*requires Eigen the more dominant implicit dependencies become anyway. At some point it will make little difference :-)
 blackburn	os253: yeah that's clear
 blackburn	I have mixed point on that..
 blackburn	at some point we won't be able to avoid that
 os253	true...
