@wiking	besser82: ping?
 besser82	wiking: pong!
@wiking	besser82: ok so i've skid the article you've sent
 besser82	wiking: and what do you say?
 besser82	wiking: What's your oppinion
@wiking	besser82: one thing we should remember: there was a plan to move slowly from SGReferencedData to std::shared_ptr
 besser82	wiking: shared_ptr like non-copyable?
@wiking	besser82: it's like the shared pointer in boost
@wiking	besser82: that does automatic reference counting + freeing
 besser82	wiking: I see  :D
 besser82	wiking: Nice idea
@wiking	so i dont know how that would work out with this idea
@wiking	as there it uses auto_ptr
 besser82	wiking: we possibly can change that,  I need to look at the specs of shared_ptr && auto_ptr
@wiking	besser82: yeah i've had a quick look they not compatible :P
 besser82	wiking: damn
@wiking	but then again
 besser82	wiking: yes
@wiking	if we put every class into shared_ptr
@wiking	it's almost like auto_ptr<>
@wiking	shared_ptr is a template as well that can hold any type of object
@wiking	template< class T > class shared_ptr;
@wiking	with that we can throw out SGReferencedData
 besser82	wiking, so they are interchangeble  ;)
@wiking	besser82: i would say so
 besser82	wiking: mostly
@wiking	but yeah if we do this
 besser82	wiking: Yes?
@wiking	we should do as well the shared_ptr thing as well
@wiking	as that would be another standardization of the code itself
@wiking	instead of using our own solution
 besser82	wiking: +1  :D
@wiking	i.e. possibly more interopability
@wiking	as it's part of c++11
 besser82	wiking: so when shall we start?
@wiking	besser82: well i think we should finish your cmake developments
@wiking	since that already introduces some kind of a vertical split of the code
 besser82	wiking, yes, somehow. but just from build-pov
@wiking	since you've created CMakeLists.txt in almost each subdir
@wiking	besser82: yeah true but that would be required anyways for this transition
 besser82	wiking, which are in 98% just symlinks to some common CMakeLists  :-P
 besser82	wiking, so my changes would be somewhat superfluous one this point of transition
 besser82	wiking, since on moving to plg.so  we basically need to change virtually everything
 besser82	wiking, like modular_interfaces and all
@wiking	besser82: well yeah modular interfaces would need a total refactoring
@wiking	besser82: so yeah basically we would need a new feature branch
@wiking	and start experimenting there
@wiking	first try to do the splitting only on the c++ level
@wiking	and then try to fix the modular interfaces
 besser82	wiking: would be a beginning  ;)
 besser82	wiking: but if we are moving to plugin-style, I'd strongly recommend keeping every plugin inside a seperate git-repo
 besser82	wiking: and use some common-toolchain to checkout and build
 besser82	wiking: which would make freezes and stuff quite easier
 besser82	wiking: have a look at those suse YaST repo-style  ;)
 besser82	wiking, https://github.com/yast
 besser82	wiking, they are using a git-repo for one thing each
 besser82	wiking, and have some common {build,dev}tools
 besser82	wiking, https://github.com/yast/yast-meta
 besser82	wiking, https://github.com/yast/yast-devtools
 besser82	wiking, with such a structure we could make things quite easier for user and developers a well
 besser82	wiking, we could create a tool like shogun-manager or sth.  which checks out the needed repos and builds them
@wiking	besser82: mmm i wouldn't do that
 besser82	wiking, why? can you explain your pov?
@wiking	besser82: i feel that that's just too much of an overhead
 besser82	wiking, in the first place  YES
 besser82	wiking, but when thinking about further progress NO
@wiking	besser82: there's just way tooo many plugins
 besser82	wiking, not everyone needs / uses the whole set of features
@wiking	besser82: if u think about Features
@wiking	or Kernel
@wiking	each of the kernel should be a separate plugin imho
@wiking	but for each of the kernel to make a separate repo
@wiking	that's just waaaay too much
 besser82	wiking, somehow
@wiking	there are for example 75 different kernel implementations
@wiking	and that's just really kernel
 besser82	wiking, i see
@wiking	think about all the others
@wiking	features, machine, classifiers
@wiking	etc etc
 besser82	wiking, so we would endup with ~400 repos or so
@wiking	or more like 1000
 besser82	wiking, but with some `smart` managment that wouldn't be so much pain
 besser82	wiking, we would just need some metadata about what's needed for which purpose  ;)
 besser82	wiking, and the manager-app could then resolve
 besser82	wiking, on the other hand we could manage the repos a bit task-based
 besser82	wiking, like having a repo for all kernel, classifier, etc ....
 besser82	wiking, a common repo
 besser82	wiking, so we would end with lemme guess ~20 repos
 besser82	wiking, have i been too aggressive on marketing my idea?  :(
@sonney2k	besser82, hey good morning
@sonney2k	besser82, any news on cmake?
@sonney2k	or have you been thinking all day night about the split thing
 besser82	sonney2k: actually that plugin-split-action(tm) occupies all my mind  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: my currrent thoughts are:  Shall I really spend more time in sth. we need to re-assemble, when running off with that split-stuff?
 besser82	sonney2k: And it is not that plugin-things, only, which moves me brains
 besser82	sonney2k: the is sooooo much stuff about shogun, it's future, our goals, the possibilities, possible movements, getting people involved, making it THE one
 besser82	sonney2k: I'm thinking about stuff centred making SHOGUN the B.I.G. thing
 besser82	sonney2k: making it easier for people to contrib
 besser82	sonney2k: creating community
 besser82	sonney2k: all such
 besser82	sonney2k: my mind currently shoots ideas like bulletts out of an uzi
 besser82	sonney2k: creating sth. like pypi or rubygems, but around shogun

 besser82	lisitsyn:  ^^^   What do you think?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yes that's how I see it
 besser82	lisitsyn: all the same I do?
 lisitsyn	besser82: actually I see it as something like cross-language platform
 lisitsyn	let me explain
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure
 lisitsyn	from linguistics position :D
 lisitsyn	shogun is like a commander ;)
 lisitsyn	I see it would be wonderful to have cross-lang inteface for cross-lang stuff
 besser82	lisitsyn: that can be implemented by a plugin  :D
 lisitsyn	yes
 besser82	lisitsyn: python is easy as dell  ;)
 lisitsyn	I mean
 lisitsyn	we have scikits, weka
 lisitsyn	we can rule them all
 lisitsyn	in a cross-platform manner
 lisitsyn	err cross-language
 besser82	lisitsyn: but ruby or other lang might be some more tricky
 lisitsyn	why?
 lisitsyn	lets have some ruby standart interface for classifier et
 lisitsyn	when once you get some code you do some glueing
 lisitsyn	to support that interface
 lisitsyn	and our runner runs and gets results back
 besser82	lisitsyn: ok, ok, but python can be intergrated like full interpreter with really few code  ;)
 lisitsyn	yeah
 lisitsyn	same for matlab etc
 besser82	lisitsyn: ruby and others are more tough
 besser82	lisitsyn: from that pov
 besser82	lisitsyn: are you sure?
 lisitsyn	besser82: sure about what? :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: embedding interpreters being easy as baking a pie?
 lisitsyn	why to embed them?
 lisitsyn	it is enough to run it as a process and get results back
 besser82	lisitsyn: like with pipes  ?
 lisitsyn	yes
 besser82	lisitsyn: would be nice to get that a bit more elaborated  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay I download some code by famous-researcher-of-machine-learning
 besser82	lisitsyn: which code from sonney2k ?!?
 lisitsyn	it has function do_stuff(...)
 besser82	lisitsyn: go on
 lisitsyn	we set up COMMON interface for matlab classifiers we support
 lisitsyn	lets say it is train(X,Y)
 lisitsyn	you write
 lisitsyn	train(X,Y)
 lisitsyn	    do_stuff(....)
 lisitsyn	with proper dispatching of parameters
 lisitsyn	I mean you extract all the data you need whatever original algorithm requires
 besser82	lisitsyn: I see
 besser82	lisitsyn: My thought on this particular topic was more like having the possibility to be able to develop plugins in other lang, which directly interface with shogun
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah if possible
 lisitsyn	but what about matlab shit?
 besser82	lisitsyn, sure for python easy as spending 500$
 besser82	lisitsyn, :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn, just a bit of code and some `Cython`-magic and here we go
 besser82	lisitsyn, so for python we just need a bit of native python-code and some Cython cppdefs ---> convert to *.cpp ---> compile a plugin ---> go
 besser82	lisitsyn, that wrapper-plugin is then able to "embed" the whole python-interpreter and load-in shogun-plugins written in pure-python
 besser82	lisitsyn, ruby, java, ...  would be some more work I guess
 besser82	lisitsyn, matlab?  I dunno, I don't own, I don't use
 besser82	lisitsyn, but should be perfectly the same as octave
 lisitsyn	yes would be better
 besser82	lisitsyn, better what?
 lisitsyn	to compile it as plugins
 besser82	lisitsyn, lang-embed-plugins you mean?
 lisitsyn	yes
 lisitsyn	than piping them
* besser82 throws an instance of confused-exception (What?)
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	besser82: making them plugins (your suggestion) would be better than piping (my suggestion)
 besser82	lisitsyn, now i got it  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes piping is somewhat fragile, I'm afraid
 besser82	lisitsyn, and i dunno whether there is protobuf support for matlab  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn, which would be another way
 besser82	lisitsyn, but having plugins "embedding" the interp  would be the best i guess
 besser82	lisitsyn, how do like that idea of having sth. like pypi or gems for shogun?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah that sounds good
 lisitsyn	besser82: though I'd make it as minimal as possible
 besser82	lisitsyn, which minimal?
 lisitsyn	besser82: just some basic thing - not like whole new packaging system
 besser82	lisitsyn, no nothing just stealing metadata stuff && needs from gems or sth  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, like having a wrapper which is able to resolve deps between plugins, fetches the needed one (e.g. git checkout), builds && registers them
 besser82	lisitsyn, with the shogun-interface-lib

 lisitsyn	besser82: actually such repo is what I want to develop :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: Nice!  then go ahead with that  :D
 lisitsyn	I think I'd like to learn a bit how to design this type of software
 besser82	lisitsyn, pkg-manager?
 lisitsyn	yeah somewhat like that
 besser82	lisitsyn, if you need some help or design ideas you can ask Ale? Kozumpl?k <ales@redhat.com>
 lisitsyn	ha you have contacts right
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, another one might be Klaus K?mpf <kkaempf@suse.de>
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am trying to learn piano, any contacts? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, mmmhhhhhh....
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is Heiko! ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, some local mi?usic-student, perhaps  :-P
 lisitsyn	he is kind of musician
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes, but not piano, i'm afraid
 lisitsyn	besser82: every musician can play piano at least a bit ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: Heiko plays guitar mainly afaik
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes,  and yes a bit for sure.  But enough to teach?
 lisitsyn	haha no idea
 besser82	lisitsyn, and mind the distance  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am experimenting of self-taught learning
 besser82	lisitsyn, me too  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, all me skillz are mostly from self-studies
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah so why not to try to learn music this way too
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, my greatest problem with that is: I'm left-handed
 lisitsyn	besser82: me too
 lisitsyn	besser82: what is the problem?
 besser82	lisitsyn, most instruments are made for right-handed
 lisitsyn	besser82: well.. kind of
 lisitsyn	besser82: but what is the instrument which is that inconvenient for left-handed guys?
 besser82	lisitsyn, guitar e.g.
 besser82	lisitsyn, basically all string instr
 lisitsyn	I feel it makes no difference when you don't know how to play ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, kk  but if you try to make it sound nice?!?
 lisitsyn	I mean it is harder to write with right hand because you have been doing it left hand all the way
 lisitsyn	but when you learn instrument it should be ok ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: there is a long way to make it sound nice anyway haha
 besser82	lisitsyn, actually it hasn't to do much with the way you learned....
 lisitsyn	besser82: I love upright bass, want to get it once and start learning
 lisitsyn	it is symmetric so no problem with left-handness
 lisitsyn	besser82: what do you mean?
 besser82	lisitsyn, it's the way the "wiring" in ya brain has grown  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am not sure, I believe you can change that wiring enough
 besser82	lisitsyn, raise a lefthanded child writing with the right hand and it will surely get depressions and other psychologic problem
 besser82	lisitsyn, known fact
 lisitsyn	oh yeah people used to do that before
 besser82	lisitsyn, some 70 y back
 lisitsyn	besser82: but that's true for any force applied to child
 besser82	lisitsyn, not with force  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, just gentle teaching is enough
 besser82	lisitsyn, one simply cannot reorder the two halves of the brain
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am not sure ambidexterity is not possible to train
 besser82	lisitsyn, nope it's born that way
 besser82	lisitsyn, there are actually a lot of things which is decided @~3rd month of pregnancy
 besser82	lisitsyn, sexual orientation, left / right handed, .....
 lisitsyn	besser82: oh no sexual orientation could be decided much later
 besser82	lisitsyn, possibly yes, but some scientist found out the basics are made then
 besser82	lisitsyn, being gay or a dyke isn't just a decision
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha yes most of the times yes it is not a decision
 lisitsyn	but I would believe it is quite related to environment and stresses you have in childhood
 besser82	lisitsyn, that can be possibly some "weak" circumstances, but I know a lot of gays which didn't have any suspicious things in their childhood
 lisitsyn	I mean just like that anecdotical thing - if girl had difficult relationships with her father you can expect some kind of sexual behaviour
 besser82	lisitsyn, they are just that way
 lisitsyn	besser82: I don't speak about great suspicious things - some small things could change the game
 besser82	lisitsyn, which ones?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: if I knew I said but that's how I see it ;)
 lisitsyn	brain and all these mental things are kinda complex you know ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, god, why did you not make brain && mental stuff like boolean????
 besser82	:-P
 lisitsyn	I am quite biased to the thought that any human is like tabula rasa once born
 besser82	lisitsyn, nope
 lisitsyn	well not physically
 lisitsyn	and not for the things that are related to genes
 besser82	lisitsyn, even not for psychologic stuff
 lisitsyn	no I can't accept that ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, baby catches more in mama's belly than we believe
 lisitsyn	well we all know baby can't speak and understand
 lisitsyn	speak and understand words not emotions
 besser82	lisitsyn, and emotions can be enough
 lisitsyn	so I am not sure it matter what is spoken around
 besser82	lisitsyn, not the word, but tone  ;)
 lisitsyn	yes I can agree human like any other animal can catch the emotion beneath
 besser82	lisitsyn, jupp
 lisitsyn	besser82: what's the jupp about? ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, s=eval(jupp) ; print $s ---> Yes
 lisitsyn	ahh
 besser82	just the german way to ack / yes  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: one more thing you could not agree with me is that thing about humans being animals ;)
 lisitsyn	I suspect you won't accept that
 besser82	lisitsyn, as long as we did not find the missing link...
 besser82	lisitsyn, I can whether denie nor agree
 besser82	lisitsyn, but everything pretty leads to the asumption the common evolution theory is correct  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, so yes, in fact we are animals
 besser82	lisitsyn, that's one thing i totally agree with
 besser82	lisitsyn, we have enough basic-instincts in us to prove that
 besser82	lisitsyn, you know why one cannot stop eating crisps once started?
 lisitsyn	besser82: haha
 besser82	lisitsyn, it has to do with our basic-instrincts
 lisitsyn	be back soon

 lisitsyn	besser82: having troubles with my notebook ac adapter haha
 besser82	lisitsyn, the sound of biting down on some crisps triggers sth in the Medulla oblongata
 besser82	lisitsyn, hehe
 lisitsyn	basically it is mechanically broken
 besser82	lisitsyn, get a new one  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah that's what I am thinking of
 lisitsyn	new notebook or new ac adapter :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, wanna buy a real mobile workstation?
 lisitsyn	besser82: oh no I am fan of small devices :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, kk
 lisitsyn	you can suggest me i19 48-core CPU
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2bts-series5-13-main-lg.jpg
 lisitsyn	my current one
 lisitsyn	piece of crap
 besser82	lisitsyn, no but i could offer i7-2680QM 4-core / HT
 besser82	lisitsyn, those are the shitty ones from samsung
 besser82	lisitsyn, my old "Q45" is still alive  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is made mostly of plastic and my way of using it makes it broken day by day
 lisitsyn	and it has already dead battery
 lisitsyn	1.5yr old
 besser82	lisitsyn, the q45 was made of magnesium  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, 7 yo
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's why I like macbook air
 besser82	lisitsyn, don't buy things with bitten fruit on it  ;)
 besser82	http://business.chip.de/bii/149460082_270cd35a4e.jpg  <-- Q45
 lisitsyn	besser82: you've got to convince sonney2k macs are bad too ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, on it
 besser82	sonney2k, ^^^  Stuff with bitten fruit on it is bad, you know  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, ^^^  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn, those are good  ;)  --->  http://shop.lenovo.com/de/de/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x240/
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah
 besser82	lisitsyn, but quite expensive for so less power
 lisitsyn	besser82: I do not need any power ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, I can sell you my q45 for ~200EUR
 lisitsyn	it would be enough to have ssd and not that bad cpu to handle
 lisitsyn	hahaha
 lisitsyn	why would I buy it
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, has ssd and Core2Duo 2,5 GHz
 besser82	lisitsyn, 4GB RAM
 besser82	lisitsyn, 12"
 besser82	lisitsyn, DVD-RW
 lisitsyn	besser82: 8 gb, ssd and 1.7 i5 here
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	sounds like downgrade
 besser82	lisitsyn, but it doesn't break  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, like the one you currently have
 lisitsyn	besser82: well it had a few flights
 besser82	lisitsyn, mine too
 besser82	lisitsyn, nothing broken
 lisitsyn	like hard landing to floor :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, mine too
 besser82	lisitsyn, nothing broken
 lisitsyn	heh yeah metal shouldn't suffer that much
 besser82	lisitsyn, only screen needed replacement once
 lisitsyn	yeah I replaced samsung screen once too
 lisitsyn	not on this machine though
 lisitsyn	russian winter (tm)
 lisitsyn	I got back to home and turn it on
 lisitsyn	I guess it was quite cold yet and a few seconds after it cracked :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, hehe
 besser82	lisitsyn, was an lcd, right?
 lisitsyn	yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, those are known to crack when getting too cold and powered
 besser82	lisitsyn, the other offer i can make is i7-2680QM 32GB-RAM, SSD, 2 HDD, BlueRay-burner, nvidia 580GTX
 besser82	lisitsyn, 1,4 Gbit/s WLAN
 lisitsyn	haha whaat a monstah
 besser82	lisitsyn, 17"  ~6kgs
 lisitsyn	hahahah
 besser82	lisitsyn, real workstation  ;)
 lisitsyn	well you don't have to go to gym
 lisitsyn	if you have such a thing
 besser82	lisitsyn, no, but how do know i don't care about my overweight?!?
 besser82	:-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: me too though I prefer to not carry such things ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, let's say so:  That Workstation suits me "size"
 lisitsyn	haha I get what you mean
 besser82	lisitsyn, 140 kgs pure erotic  :-P
 lisitsyn	haha yeah then I totally get what I mean
 lisitsyn	a bit less than 100 here :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, you must "train" harder then to get closer to the 140  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: with my kind of genetic properties it should be easy enough :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: I guess you haven't trained hard to achieve that too ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, not really
 lisitsyn	it is a gift haha
 lisitsyn	of nature
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, but some girls don't understand that :(
 lisitsyn	hehe yeah

 besser82	lisitsyn, ^^^  merge alert!!!!
 lisitsyn	besser82: alarm
 besser82	lisitsyn, AUSWEIS BITTE!
 lisitsyn	besser82: I remember there was a game with germans yell
 lisitsyn	ALARM
 lisitsyn	I think it is commandos
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes some 15 years back or so  ;)
 lisitsyn	cool game
 lisitsyn	I should not take a look at it to not ruin my memories
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, you know Wolfenstein 3D?
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 besser82	lisitsyn, the Germans there are yelling stuff too
 besser82	lisitsyn, MEIN LEBEN!
 lisitsyn	and in 'return to castle wolfenstein' too ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, both games are forbidden in Germany
 lisitsyn	really?
 lisitsyn	hahaha
 lisitsyn	lol
 besser82	lisitsyn, but everbody has a copy  :-P
 lisitsyn	why?
 besser82	lisitsyn, because of some graphical 3rd Reich symbols
 besser82	lisitsyn, like those svatiskas and pictures of Hitler
 lisitsyn	but they look cool ;)
 lisitsyn	it has its own aesthetics
 besser82	lisitsyn, in Indiana Jones the last Crusade there was a special version for germany too
 besser82	lisitsyn, somehow yes, but those symbols are forbidden in germany
 lisitsyn	I mean it wasn't a cool thing but I don't think restricting every mention of anything
 lisitsyn	is a good thing to do
 besser82	lisitsyn, showing stuff is ~5y prison
 lisitsyn	like these holocaust denial laws - people should be free to be idiots and believe to anything they want
 besser82	lisitsyn, not in germany
 lisitsyn	besser82: why?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I know it is that but I mean it would be better to not restrict anything ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, those laws were made by the allied
 besser82	lisitsyn, and are still valid
 besser82	lisitsyn, like some other crappy law too
 lisitsyn	besser82: nazi symbols are forbidden here too by the way
 besser82	lisitsyn, laws surving stalin, I guess?
 lisitsyn	besser82: hmm I don't know when was it introduced
 lisitsyn	besser82: actually stalin's laws were beautiful piece of humanity
 lisitsyn	but not the real life :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, hehe
 besser82	lisitsyn, some minor contradiction
 besser82	lisitsyn, like in all totalitary systems ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: stalin is a hero for like a half of people here ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, shouldn't that be lenin?
 lisitsyn	besser82: no lenin is like forgotten
 besser82	lisitsyn, or Gorbatschow
 besser82	lisitsyn, like for people in Ex-GDR
 lisitsyn	gorbi is hated
 lisitsyn	besser82: most of the people just hate gorbachev
 besser82	lisitsyn, what did he do?
 lisitsyn	in their minds he destroyed the great country
 lisitsyn	;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: in fact it was on the way to be destroyed anyway
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, CCCP was on it's last breathes those days
 lisitsyn	besser82: same thing for yeltsin
 lisitsyn	which is totally hated too
 besser82	lisitsyn, Boris I can understand  ;)
 lisitsyn	well at least he was a funny guy
 besser82	lisitsyn, funny yes, but ...
 lisitsyn	most of the time being drunk
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, There is some discount vodka named after him in Germany  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, Jeltzin - pure russian vodka  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: he wasn't the most clever guy but he let quite okish people to rule
 lisitsyn	so 90s were not that terrible
 besser82	lisitsyn, and then came Putin  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: yes and he made a few good things and then become a monster
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	basically starting from 2004-2006 he has been doing crazy things
 besser82	lisitsyn, then went to make some serious $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  and left over to Medwedwew
 lisitsyn	besser82: extra oil prices made people quite rich in 2001-2004
 lisitsyn	most of the people bought cars these days etc
 lisitsyn	it was really good years economics-wise
 besser82	lisitsyn, but now most people are poor again  :(
 lisitsyn	besser82: there are crazy amounts of money still
 lisitsyn	actually just go get it
 besser82	lisitsyn, lets-a-go !!!!!
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, tell me where to grab  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: no really, goverment still has a lot of money
 besser82	lisitsyn, and some very few others
 lisitsyn	besser82: we do a project for russian railways
 besser82	lisitsyn, which one?
 lisitsyn	well some scheduling
 lisitsyn	and we get quite $$$
 lisitsyn	for nothing serious
 besser82	lisitsyn, then go out and grab some more  ;)
 lisitsyn	they have millions of $ flying around
 lisitsyn	besser82: they just care to grab some % of that and redirect the work
 lisitsyn	and still in the end (2-3 step of redirection)
 lisitsyn	it is quite good money
 lisitsyn	if I wasn't on salary I'd get rich with such things :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, then put your foot in the door and save me a place in that chain  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, and then we redirect the work to some indians
 lisitsyn	besser82: that's quite easy - you just talk to right people
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, like 75% us / 25% them  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: I can say they are mostly located in moscow :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, then start talking  ;)
 lisitsyn	no other places to make deals in russia
 besser82	lisitsyn, don't you live in Moscow
 lisitsyn	besser82: no, samara
 besser82	lisitsyn, is it a great distance?
 lisitsyn	besser82: 1K km
 lisitsyn	1.15 by plane ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, ok
 besser82	lisitsyn, so need to go
 besser82	lisitsyn, so I need to go there  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: really all the money is in moscwo
 lisitsyn	quite easy thing :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, but i don't speak tha ???????  :(
 lisitsyn	I suspect you have less centric distribution of money flow
 besser82	lisitsyn, actually yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, in Germany it is more shattered
 lisitsyn	as far as I know munich is kind of more rich city than berlin
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 besser82	lisitsyn, and more expensive by far
 lisitsyn	that's impossible for russia - everything is in moscow
 lisitsyn	:D
 besser82	lisitsyn, 2-room, ghetto-style flat starts @ 1K5EUR without heating
 lisitsyn	that's crazy
 besser82	lisitsyn, there are more people than flats  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: however quite similar to moscow prices
 besser82	lisitsyn, let's go moscow and grab some $$$, then
 lisitsyn	besser82: I pay ~625$ here
 besser82	lisitsyn, for what?
 lisitsyn	1 room, ~70 m2
 besser82	lisitsyn, that's normal price like in Germany
 lisitsyn	besser82: quite above average here
 lisitsyn	besser82: though I decided to take it due to larger volume and 18th floor ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, 18th floor !?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah
 besser82	lisitsyn, who wants to live there?
 lisitsyn	besser82: I ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: why not?
 besser82	lisitsyn, It's da much too high
 lisitsyn	besser82: http://instagram.com/p/cedWoGTfWN/
 lisitsyn	that's what I see from da window when it is summer
 besser82	lisitsyn, looks like somewhere in an industrial complex....
 lisitsyn	besser82: no typical russian city
 lisitsyn	besser82: the closest building is university :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, other countries, other circumstances  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I'd say it is kind of new centre of the city actually
 besser82	lisitsyn, you can imagine me house like some in a typical uptown-suburb
 lisitsyn	besser82: I like that kind of houses
 besser82	lisitsyn, wanna come to germany?
 besser82	lisitsyn, have some flat in spare  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: not decided where I want to come :)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am 'almost married' ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn,  good for getting visa  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn,  esp. USA
 besser82	lisitsyn,  :D
 lisitsyn	they didn't give it to me though
 besser82	lisitsyn,  then go get married and you'll get  ;)
 lisitsyn	yes but a bit later :D
 besser82	lisitsyn,  for germany you just need grandpa with german shepheard  :-P
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am neither jew nor related to germany in any means ;)
 lisitsyn	so no options but typisch process :)
 besser82	lisitsyn,  yes, like I said
 besser82	lisitsyn,  you need to tell you granpa had a german shepheard  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn,  BITTE SEHR, IHRE PAPIERE  :D
 lisitsyn	besser82: I am not sure I understand what is shepheard ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, it's a dog  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: ah then I get it right

-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-235-33-212.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has left #shogun []
 besser82	lisitsyn, ^^^  Heiko hat's kaputt gemacht  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, let's get back to some more serious stuff, like "How we can make SHOGUN rule the world"  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: shogun kaputt gemacht
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, how do we want to start making shogun better?
 besser82	lisitsyn, liking doing plugins and all?
 lisitsyn	besser82: 1) I get some rest 2) I start doing some shit
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	besser82: we should start experimenting with plugins
 lisitsyn	cause I have barely any idea how to develop that so far
 besser82	lisitsyn, did you read the link in my email?
 lisitsyn	not yet
 lisitsyn	good you remind
 besser82	lisitsyn, there is some idea about how to get some very basic plugin"server"
 besser82	lisitsyn, like loading and registering symbols
 besser82	lisitsyn, some ground to start from
 besser82	lisitsyn, wiking had some idea about using shared_ptr for CSGObjects
 besser82	lisitsyn, and derived
@sonney2k	besser82, lisitsyn are you guys enjoying the trip?
 besser82	sonney2k, which trip?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what trip?
@sonney2k	seems like it is not cold enough to kill the fancy mushrooms
 lisitsyn	besser82: is he trying to offence us? :D
 besser82	lisitsyn, looks like
@sonney2k	you have all the dictator power of stalin and hitler combined
@sonney2k	I am more than afraid!
 lisitsyn	I don't get this language :D
 lisitsyn	I feel unsafe
 besser82	sonney2k, we don't want to harm anybody  ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what is wrong with java modular javac: file not found: /home/travis/build/shogun-toolbox/shogun/build/src/interfaces/java_modular/*.java ?!
 lisitsyn	besser82: I see auto_ptr here
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, did someone remove java stuff?
 lisitsyn	auto_ptr is a NO-GO
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it wasn't me
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, that is just an example
 besser82	lisitsyn, we need to mod that ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay well I get it
 lisitsyn	besser82: this technique is known for me
 besser82	lisitsyn, auto_ptr is one posibility amoung much and some few better ones ;)
 lisitsyn	shared_ptr for the win!
 besser82	lisitsyn, +1  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: auto_ptr is dangerous with its strange copy behaviour
 lisitsyn	besser82: the main problem I see is
 besser82	lisitsyn, which
 lisitsyn	how to resolve some plugin in python
 lisitsyn	i.e. I wrote a plugin
 lisitsyn	how can I resolve it w/o the need to recompile shogun with its support
 lisitsyn	shogun.mypluginclassifier
 lisitsyn	this won't work
 besser82	lisitsyn, like building a c++-base pluging which provides the interpreter
 lisitsyn	I mean basic shogun doesn't export plugin names
 besser82	lisitsyn, we don't need
 lisitsyn	well but you need to get that shogun.myclassifier
 lisitsyn	how do you do that?
 besser82	lisitsyn, we need some cheap metadata around with the plugins
 lisitsyn	yes it is clear
 lisitsyn	but still
 besser82	lisitsyn, datatypes and object shall get unified
 lisitsyn	for our user
 lisitsyn	how does he call new plugin?
 lisitsyn	shogun.load('mystuff')?
 lisitsyn	or what?
 besser82	lisitsyn, sth. like that
 besser82	lisitsyn, and that plugin should have some init() to provide ptr to all stuff inside
 lisitsyn	well factory
 lisitsyn	it should provide a factory
 besser82	lisitsyn, the plugin?
 lisitsyn	yeah so you can create new classifier
 besser82	lisitsyn, classifier like?
 lisitsyn	besser82: well you loaded a module
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	and then use its factory to create new instance
 lisitsyn	of classifier it supports
 lisitsyn	or whatever it does
 besser82	lisitsyn, that should be handled by some kind of plugin server....
 lisitsyn	why?
 lisitsyn	you should be able to create multiple instances of that
 besser82	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	so it should be explicit
 besser82	lisitsyn, but handled through plugin-server
 lisitsyn	'I need liblinear SVM instance'
 lisitsyn	besser82: the worst thing here is that we need to use a lot of strings
 lisitsyn	to name modules, to resolve them during runtime
 besser82	lisitsyn, pluginserver.request('instance of type')
 besser82	lisitsyn, which then returns ptr to that new instace
 lisitsyn	I think it is shogun.create('LibLinearSVM') or whatever
 lisitsyn	or even
 lisitsyn	shogun.createClassifier(..)
 lisitsyn	cause you need it explicit in python
 besser82	lisitsyn, how ever we name the child ;)
 lisitsyn	otherwise people won't able to cast it back to classifier
 besser82	lisitsyn, unfied object /data- types ???
 lisitsyn	besser82: how unified?
 lisitsyn	is it up to sgobject or whatever it is called?
 besser82	lisitsyn, like having only one type of each thing
 besser82	lisitsyn, Things deriving from CSGObj should be unified eg
 lisitsyn	ehmmm so kernel and classifier have the same set of methods?
 besser82	lisitsyn, posibly
 besser82	lisitsyn, lemme check code
 lisitsyn	besser82: it could be a problem
 besser82	lisitsyn, why?
 lisitsyn	well what is apply for kernel?
 lisitsyn	or what is train for distance
 besser82	lisitsyn, empty stub, that does nothing?
 lisitsyn	besser82: sounds bad
 lisitsyn	I mean too many methods that do nothing but exist there for a reason
 besser82	lisitsyn, how to resolve otherwise?
 besser82	sonney2k, are you still around?!?
 lisitsyn	besser82: create_classifier, create_processor etc
 besser82	lisitsyn, andd how to annouce / declare the availability?
 lisitsyn	la excepcione !
 lisitsyn	throw new FuckYouException
 lisitsyn	:D

* besser82 throws an instace of FuckYouException: (What?) MyAss!!!
 besser82	lisitsyn, ?????
 lisitsyn	besser82: okay availability of what?
@sonney2k	besser82, yes
 besser82	sonney2k, what's wrong with java?
@sonney2k	besser82, travis is unhappy
@sonney2k	I am waiting for the buildbot to see if this is just a heisenbug
 besser82	lisitsyn, about which methods / functions are inside the new avail class
@sonney2k	besser82, actually all good on the buildbot
 besser82	sonney2k, looks like a glitch to me
 besser82	lisitsyn, without needing predecl or headers?
 lisitsyn	besser82: if we speak about plugins we have no headers
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I only see the problem with registering sth new to non-interpreted interfaces (java, csharp, ...)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes but that's terribly major proble
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, why? everything has to be available *at compile time*
@sonney2k	that is normal with such $langs
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: how can plugin be available at compile time?
 besser82	lisitsyn, they don't need but some decl needs to be
 lisitsyn	then we have to put every and each plugin to shogun itself
 lisitsyn	I mean at least their exported names
 besser82	lisitsyn, or we just use unified stuff ;)
 lisitsyn	unified interface is the way
 lisitsyn	but it is not unified like one possible class
 lisitsyn	rather a few possible classes
 besser82	lisitsyn, as i said
 besser82	lisitsyn, a handfull of generic stuff and all is fine ;)
 besser82	sonney2k, did you read those full backlog?
 besser82	sonney2k, like the beginning of my chat with lisitsyn ?
 besser82	sonney2k, what's your oppionion about that?!?
@sonney2k	besser82, yeah but no idea what you have in your minds
 besser82	sonney2k, mein kopf ist so klar, wie der korn darin  :-P
 besser82	sonney2k, features, features, features
 lisitsyn	haha we have to write specification
 lisitsyn	we all know what do we want to get
 besser82	sonney2k, like pluginize everything and make stuff possible like with e.g. rubygems
 besser82	sonney2k, shogun-samurai install fancy-extension-for-shogun  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn, spec like?
 lisitsyn	besser82: describe anything
 lisitsyn	before coding
 besser82	lisitsyn, ahh kk  like ISO  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, bakufu is the name
 besser82	sonney2k, that was the name i wanted to reserve for the "core" stuff  ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: yes first ISO certified machine learning toolbox :D
 lisitsyn	can we speak docs
 lisitsyn	?
 lisitsyn	besser82: sonney2k: are you ok with describing it in gdoc?
 besser82	sonney2k, like having shogun the interface, bakufu the "core" plugins maintained by us and samurai for community / gem stuff  ;)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, or github wiki!
 besser82	sonney2k, +1  ;)

 lisitsyn	sonney2k: besser82: it is less realtime but ok
 lisitsyn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/Shogun-splitting
 lisitsyn	how does it handle multiple changes?
 lisitsyn	are they overwritten?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, realtime is etherpad
@sonney2k	e.g. http://beta.etherpad.org/
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: google docs is as well?
 lisitsyn	I trust google docs more :D
 lisitsyn	especially due
 lisitsyn	to ' Pad contents are destroyed periodically'
 besser82	lisitsyn, sonney2k which one now? gh-wiki, gdocs or ethercrap?
 lisitsyn	no idea :)
@sonney2k	I am for gh-wiki
@sonney2k	it is public -> better
 lisitsyn	okay
 besser82	lisitsyn, sonney2k me is fine with either
