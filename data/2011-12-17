@sonney2k	blackburn, I think we should try to get http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~shindler/kMeansCode/ this fast k-means code into shogun
@sonney2k	shouldn't be too difficult so if someone asks for what to do...
@sonney2k	also, porting birch (java) to c++ would make sense
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm sure
@sonney2k	and I would propose some new branch of algorithms for sampling from data, i.e. getting a uniform subset
@sonney2k	or some other more complicated ways
 blackburn	you are nipsted
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	there is more
@sonney2k	someone here had a fast cross - validation scheme
@sonney2k	that would be very cool stuff for heiko
 blackburn	sorry but I'm really out of time till new year
 blackburn	fast CV scheme? how can it be fast?
@sonney2k	btw, we have now shogun in debian unstable again...
 blackburn	did you packed it?
@sonney2k	it does CV on small subsets of the data first
@sonney2k	and this way can throw away lots of combinations to be tested. then it increases these subsets slowly - speedups of 2 orders of magnitude without loss are possible
 blackburn	sonney2k: I now need some binary tree classifier making possible to use say LDA for multiclass
 blackburn	how do you think it is useful?
@sonney2k	I am currently messing with python -builtin
 blackburn	what is builtin?
@sonney2k	no more .py files but direct py objects
@sonney2k	an option for swig
@sonney2k	blackburn, you are talking about a certain error correcting codes scheme right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, it is a variant of binary tree classifier
@sonney2k	to convert any binary classifier into a multiclass classifier?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	there was another very nice algorithm at nips for that
@sonney2k	some boosting with minimal set of features - massively many classes - but very fast and accurate
@sonney2k	ahh and a binary tree thingy too - that sounded very reasonable work - let me check if I find it
 blackburn	I need something like that for my road signs work
@sonney2k	how many classes do you have?
 blackburn	now 43, but will have much more
 blackburn	some of them should be grouped for sure
 blackburn	like red signs, blue signs, etc
@sonney2k	one is ShareBoost: Efficient multiclass learning with feature sharing
@sonney2k	S. Shalev-Shwartz, Y. Wexler, A. Shashua
 blackburn	got it thanks
@sonney2k	the other is http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/Program/event.php?ID=2647
@sonney2k	this is probably more what you could directly use
@sonney2k	it infers the tree and learns the SVms / LDA whatever
@sonney2k	seemed very reasonable
 blackburn	yes, I had similar idea before I get to know it is already done :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ohh yes please add pointers to all of that in the bts :-)
 blackburn	bts?
@sonney2k	these are all very worthwhile ideas for gsoc
@sonney2k	bug tracking system
@sonney2k	aka github issues
 blackburn	ah yes I'll add it
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is the thing with the sampling http://nips.cc/Conferences/2011/Program/event.php?ID=3000
@sonney2k	they use it to do fast GMM estimation
@sonney2k	i.e. they sample from the data and then on that sample estimate the GMM
@sonney2k	but the sampling is very clever...
 blackburn	pretty simple idea heh
 blackburn	well and my point is that all the things should be as simple as it could be
@sonney2k	yeah - and easy to implement... we just need some new class of 'sampler' algorithms
@sonney2k	the get as input some data and then return an index with a subset :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: TreeMulticlassMachine?
@sonney2k	no I think this should be under classifier
@sonney2k	MulticlassTreeClassifier ?
 blackburn	why classifier?
 blackburn	ah yes
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rce5c547 / src/shogun/converter/DiffusionMaps.h : Mentioned paper on DiffusionMasp - http://git.io/jmqxHg
 blackburn	sonney2k: is your TU mail available for you still?
@sonney2k	better use mey debian.org address
@sonney2k	it is but not for long I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm asking cause Ori Cohen wrote to both of us, have you seen?
 blackburn	it is a guy who was working on C# examples too
@sonney2k	yes I have seen - I don't know what to do about it
@sonney2k	I thought you added him to NEWS?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, he said it is ok for him
@sonney2k	btw we have to update the website right to point to github issues
@sonney2k	what is the url btw?
 blackburn	ehm
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	yes that one, let me do the update
@sonney2k	then I can also include Ori in the NEWS on the site
 blackburn	yes please do then
@sonney2k	done
@sonney2k	btw, we got our windows7 buildbot
@sonney2k	I just didn't have time to administer it
 blackburn	heh nice

@sonney2k	blackburn, just one thought - should we add some print / string function to show a compact output of shogun objects?
@sonney2k	e.g. they could show their name and list parameters this way?
 blackburn	sonney2k: well why not
 blackburn	sonney2k: not the crucial thing though, no idea how to use it
@sonney2k	well you could just do
@sonney2k	x=GaussianKernel()
@sonney2k	print x
@sonney2k	and then it will not say
@sonney2k	<Swig Object of type 'shogun::CGaussianKernel *' at 0x7fe290d0db90>
@sonney2k	but
@sonney2k	GaussianKernel - Parameters width=1
 blackburn	sure, I understand
@sonney2k	for features it could show the same kind of summary we have for numpy arrays
@sonney2k	rather useful I would say
 puneetgoyal	hey :), why do we generally use this gaussian kernel ?
 puneetgoyal	I mean..in most examples, I had seen this kernel only
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: it has some nice features
 blackburn	like 'virtual' infinite-dimension gilbert space mapping hah :)
 puneetgoyal	ok

 puneetgoyal	hello, I was trying to tokenize emails and now a bit close to it...I wanted to know if there is a way to parse all the files containing the email data to store them in a matrix ?
 blackburn	hmm how?
 puneetgoyal	how I made tokens from an email..or How I wanna parse all files?
 blackburn	how can you store email data in matrix?..
 puneetgoyal	to tokenize emails...I used the email package and its various modules
 puneetgoyal	I can extract various information from an email that will be used to calculate the probability of an email being a spam or a ham using that email package of python
 puneetgoyal	and store them in a matrix
 blackburn	is it a matrix of probabilities?
 puneetgoyal	no, I guess probabilities will be calculated after I train my system using some emails ?
 blackburn	so it is a token matrix?
 puneetgoyal	yes
 blackburn	how do you plan to use it?
 puneetgoyal	should I use some other method for training?
 blackburn	you may feel free to use any but I'm in doubts
 blackburn	cause stringfeatures in shogun supports just a list of strings
 blackburn	but not a list of list of strings
 puneetgoyal	ok, so from where should I procede?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: I would suggest you to compute similarity measure with some written-by-you-technique
 blackburn	and then form similarity matrix to train SVM or so
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: for example you can count identical tokens
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: sry, forgot to reply...I was reading about similarty measures
 blackburn	np
 puneetgoyal	identical tokens?
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: ['this','is','spam'] is 1.0 to ['this','is','spam'], but 0.6667 to ['this','is','sparta']
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: yes, but while testing right? I mean the list I will compare the mail with...would be made after training
 blackburn	not sure I understood you
 puneetgoyal	I mean suppose the first list you gave is a mail you want to check, and second is the list you already have...that you know is a spam or a ham
 blackburn	so?
 puneetgoyal	but to get the second list, you will first have to get some training data
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	well just get some training mails, determine its status
 blackburn	and form matrix containing similarity between i-th and j-th mails
 puneetgoyal	ok, and would have to write the respective weights against each of the keywords
 puneetgoyal	ok, I will make a module to construct this matrix asap
 blackburn	puneetgoyal: hey why do you hurry?
 puneetgoyal	blackburn: I dont have anything else to do now...so can spend the whole time over this :D
