@sonney2k	night everyone!
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: no idea how can it fail with such a small count of matched neighbors..
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: not connected graph I guess
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: but then why there's no warning?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I don't think it is shown by default

@lisitsyn	will run it a few thousand times :D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: good idea:) btw, I've read somewhere about interesting feature in one testing framework: it saved all the randomly generated values, and if the test failed - you could look what the values where
 vgorbati	were*
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: no fail for 1000 runs
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: you looked at the  previous builds results, or what?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: for i in {1..1000}; do ./shogun-unit-test --gtest_filter=Isomap*; done
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: or, at least I can refactor the test so that it will print the generated matrix if it fails. What about this?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: we will have to wait some time it occurs again
@lisitsyn	let me finish some refactoring (again) and check the example

@HeikoS	sonney2k, lisitsyn just compilling shogun, really like the new outputs :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ha!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you are the first one said it is better
@lisitsyn	I wonder whether others do really like to see G+G++G+G++G+ -DTOTOTOT
@HeikoS	why?
@HeikoS	much cleaner
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I could add a progress too
@HeikoS	I would even surpress the swig message
@HeikoS	that would be good!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what do you use to hack shogun?
@lisitsyn	eclipse?
@HeikoS	eclipse
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	that the best ide I know
@lisitsyn	I see
@HeikoS	browsing code, debugger, syntax stuff
@HeikoS	a little slow though
@HeikoS	but I gut a 4cpu computer :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: just trying git-flow for my new feature for the first time
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  what do you use?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: vim + clang_complete
@HeikoS	vim wow :O)
@HeikoS	I used to do that
@HeikoS	but got RSI all the time :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: clang complete is really cool now
@HeikoS	now I use a mouse
@HeikoS	dont know that what does it do
@HeikoS	?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: well jump to definition + autocomplete
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	well ok
@lisitsyn	+ snippets if you set them up
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: surprisingly fast within shogun
@lisitsyn	slower in tapkee due to heavy headers
@HeikoS	I see
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I was helping sonney2k to set it up yesterday that's why I asked
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	I mean it wasn't that good before
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	what did he use before?
@HeikoS	Do you reccomend it over eclipse?
@lisitsyn	vim but without anything
@lisitsyn	like that
@lisitsyn	now he is using eclipse I think
-!- nube [~rho@202.166.195.66] has joined #shogun
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no not really if you are used to eclipse
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	eclipse only works on string computers
@HeikoS	but its very nice
@lisitsyn	string?
@HeikoS	I also use it for python development
@HeikoS	and its a blast for this
@lisitsyn	strong?
@HeikoS	strong
@HeikoS	sorry
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	:)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: clang_complete is quite resource-demanding too
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: basically it 'precompiles' everything with clang
@HeikoS	oh
@HeikoS	eclipse does something similar though
@lisitsyn	parses actually
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what is good about clang
@lisitsyn	is that they propose a good api
@lisitsyn	to access abstract syntax tree
@lisitsyn	and so on
-!- nube [~rho@202.166.195.66] has quit [Client Quit]
@lisitsyn	so you just extract things from the compiler itself
@lisitsyn	no need to write your own parser etc
@lisitsyn	eclipse parses it though
@lisitsyn	they are using their own indexing system I think
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw if you ever mess with java - use intellij idea
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: idea is usually smarter than a programmer which uses it :D

@sonney2k	HeikoS, well some stuff fails due to some error in preprocessor conversion from ** -> dyn*array
@HeikoS	sonney2k: my errors were caused by something else
@lisitsyn	it is unhealthy we get no error in unit-tests now though
@lisitsyn	:)
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  btw currently woking on equals method
@HeikoS	hope to finish it today
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:
@HeikoS	how to enable debug messages
@lisitsyn	HeikoS:
@HeikoS	sorry to ask over and over again
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where?
@HeikoS	but I just cannot get them
@lisitsyn	runtime?
@HeikoS	TParameter
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	SG_SDEBUG
@HeikoS	I do
@HeikoS	sg_io->set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG);
@lisitsyn	any shogun object -> io -> set_loglevel(MSG_DEBUG)
@HeikoS	after shogun init
@lisitsyn	yes this should work too
@HeikoS	but I dont see debug messages I place in the code
@HeikoS	is it this init_with_defaults maybe?
@lisitsyn	what if you try it on "io"
@lisitsyn	of some object?
@HeikoS	I done have a shogun object
@HeikoS	just using TParameter
@HeikoS	compile switches??
@HeikoS	I did with --enable-debug
@HeikoS	SG_SPRINT works
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no should not be related to switches
@HeikoS	really annyoing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: you do it right way indeed
@lisitsyn	if god existed it could know
@lisitsyn	why it fails
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: didnt you guys recently change stuff in the print code?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yeah there even was a bug
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: still fails?
@HeikoS	yes, but I am working on something else currently
@HeikoS	its very annoying would be good to have this fixed
@HeikoS	developing is easier with debug messages
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: u can't touch this
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	exactly :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: if you make me an example
@lisitsyn	to reproduce
@lisitsyn	;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: developing with unit tests is very nice btw
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: like TDD?
@lisitsyn	TDD is nice indeed but with C++ and big codebase it is freaking slow :(
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ok will come soon
@HeikoS	TDD?
@lisitsyn	test driven development
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: when you write tests and then try to make your program to pass all of them
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I glanced over graphlab code yesterday
@lisitsyn	ohh I like these guys
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  yes
@HeikoS	quite nice
@HeikoS	currently doing this for the equals method
@HeikoS	a test for every thing I add
@HeikoS	so I can build on things that work :)
@lisitsyn	we are thinking in the same way
@lisitsyn	C++-wise
@HeikoS	graphlab is awesome
@HeikoS	I will soon finish my module that I wrote for it
@HeikoS	kernel BP distributed :) very cool, so easy to write code that scales
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I still believe our core should be distributed
@lisitsyn	but with all these interfaces
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ah I dont know
@HeikoS	shogun is not really designed for this
@HeikoS	rather build code that uses shogun within a distributed setting
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: where do we go then
@HeikoS	so for example
@HeikoS	my gaussian sparse stuff
@HeikoS	will be used from a distributed setting
@HeikoS	shogun provides building blocks
@HeikoS	so I keep that in mind when designing
@lisitsyn	no we don't provide building blocks
@lisitsyn	all these objects are not blocks already
@lisitsyn	rather bad designed opencv provides blocks
@lisitsyn	but we do provide a final solution, very hard to use as block
@lisitsyn	I think
@HeikoS	we can discuss all this :)
@HeikoS	but it will take a lot of time to :)

@lisitsyn	biggest ice hockey dictator ever hah
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yeah, I was wondering if it somehow connected with potatoes:)
@lisitsyn	the potato master
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: actually moustache - that's the answer
@lisitsyn	moustache and potato
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and no pants
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ohh that's your secret
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I guess the potato master wears pants
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: okay it is over, rus 3 - 1 svk
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: congrats:)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: btw when will that proffessor go away?
@lisitsyn	:D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: are you talking about our president?:)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yeeah the proffessor
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I am afraid he can choose the Putin way)
@lisitsyn	poor ukraine
@sonney2k	the proffessssooor?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: their president thinks he is a proffessor
@lisitsyn	I'd say believes so
@sonney2k	professor btw
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no
@sonney2k	but still?!
@lisitsyn	he thinks he is
@lisitsyn	a
@lisitsyn	proFFeSSor
@sonney2k	I don't get it...
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: he wrote that
@lisitsyn	in some document
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: like 'what is your scientific degree'
@lisitsyn	proffessor
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	our politicians are all PhD's
@sonney2k	but they just use copy & paste to get it :P
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh yes ours are too
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: come on
@lisitsyn	I guess only a few
@sonney2k	lots of scandals recently
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: 2? 3?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I remember defence affairs minister
@sonney2k	<10 sure
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we have may be 20 false phds in government
@sonney2k	but still high ranks
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: they just say 'it is too old to check whether it is a copy paste'
@sonney2k	and they totally feel ok with it
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but they leave right?
@lisitsyn	ours don't leave
@sonney2k	not really leave
@sonney2k	they go to EU or so
@sonney2k	EU parliament I mean
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but leave their positions
@sonney2k	after a year of saying I didn't copy&paste
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: our president has stolen thesis
@sonney2k	and enough pressure
@sonney2k	from all sides
@lisitsyn	most of investigators died though :D
@lisitsyn	probability stuff you know
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: the ukrainian guy just puts everyone to jail, just ask vgorbati :D
 vgorbati	:D
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: so is it ready?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yeah, I am trying to merge it - first tome some problems occured:)
@lisitsyn	may happen
@lisitsyn	as I modify tapkee concurrently sometimes
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw I hope you are using https://github.com/vim-scripts/a.vim
@sonney2k	too
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ohh I would be very very stupid
@lisitsyn	if I was not

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, alright let me do the preproc stuff
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: some ref issue I guess?
@sonney2k	nah I am more or less redoing this adding a test etc
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: fuh, added
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: err, sent a PR
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: commenting
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: watching:)
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: there's no 'in_range' now for tapkee parameter?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: inRange I think
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: great thing
@lisitsyn	passing over it for a third time :D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: passing over what? inRange?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: over your pr
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ah:) about "Please remove additional spaces - that would be more consistent with other code without them" - is it about spaces in "while ( ( (no_improvement_counter++ < max_number_of_iterations_without_improvement)" ?
@lisitsyn	yes
 vgorbati	ok
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: just for consistency
@lisitsyn	with other code
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: sure
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I am that detailed as tapkee is my kid :D
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: :D about camel case - I coded too much in python - hard to switch from it to new_variable_naming_style:)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: actually I am now confused too
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I used to use sdsad_dasds all the time
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: variables are this_variable
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: one more issue
@lisitsyn	I think I am going to get rid of using std:: stuff
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: do you realize why?
@lisitsyn	that's an interesting issue as I didn't realized
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: what's with it?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: if we have a class vector in the same compilation unit
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: that's not about shogun but tapkee is available standalone you know
@lisitsyn	so if we have it
@lisitsyn	we get a clash
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I thought that 'using' is exactly for this cases)
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: we can have multiple using
@lisitsyn	that smells like undefined behaviour
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: don't they work for a single file?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I think compilation unit
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: so one object file
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I am not a compiler expert, so may be. So, switch to using std::stuff every time?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: I think I am going to do something else
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: you mean there's nothing to change from my side?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: keep it std for now
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: but without using
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok. Going to sleep now, will start fixing and finishing implementation from tomorrow
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: alright
 vgorbati	good night everybody

 pickle27	hey guys
 pickle27	what happened to CMath::display_matrix in the develop branch?
 shogun-buildbot	build #809 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed configure]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/809  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@lisitsyn	pickle27: what's with it?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: it appears to be gone?
@lisitsyn	pickle27: I think it is in SGMatrix
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah there are print functions in there
 pickle27	lisitsyn: is that the new way to print?
@lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah probably
@lisitsyn	I didn't like it but CMath is even worse
 pickle27	lisitsyn: makes sense I guess
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay just working through my Eigen3 LDA and I need to print my eigen matrices and want to make sure I'm consistent with the rest of shogun
@sonney2k	pickle27, in SGMatrix yes
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: you were sleeping
@lisitsyn	:D
 pickle27	sonney2k: yeah I got it figured out now, thanks!
@sonney2k	no I was saying good nite to vgorbati
