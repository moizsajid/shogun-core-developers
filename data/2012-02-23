 sonne|work	wiking: now yes :)
 wiking	sonne|work: i saw that you were publishing some papers with vojtek
 wiking	and i was wondering if i can ask some stuff about libqp
 wiking	:P
 wiking	it's not implementation more just theory
 wiking	about the condition of the objective function
 sonne|work	btw, vojtech wants to mentor lipqp / shogun integration + some generalizations
 wiking	heheh would be up for that
 wiking	i mean i don't know
 wiking	whether i can do what i'd like to do now
 wiking	with libqp
 wiking	i've read his paper about it
 wiking	a novel algorithm for learning ...
 wiking	damn i cannot copy-paste from .ps
 wiking	anyhow the subj. to part is <w, Psi (x_k, y_k) - Psi (x_k, y) >  >= L (y_k, y) - epsilon
 wiking	and i'm thinking about how to extend it, by having a 3 variable for Psi...
 wiking	i guess then the problem would not be anymore convex necessarily thus i'd need to do something like CCCP
 sonne|work	concatenating variables is not possible?
 wiking	but then it'd be quite 'simple' to implement latent-svm
 sonne|work	ahh ok
 wiking	i want to introduce a latent variable there...
 sonne|work	doesnt' exactly sound fast but yes
 wiking	i've seen this paper Max-Margin Min-Entropy Models from some guys from stanford and i'd like to extend their algo and test it
 wiking	but of course the implementation is .... well yeah it's not out anywhere
 wiking	so i was thinking to do something with shogun
 wiking	anyhow vojtec is responsive to his emails?
 wiking	coz the guy whom i sent about latent-svm never got back to me
 sonne|work	he should be, just tell him that you might be interested in his libqp / shogun project
 wiking	(alexander binder)
 sonne|work	he is a nice guy
 sonne|work	really?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	sent him about a week ago
 sonne|work	please send the mail again and CC me
 wiking	alrighty
 wiking	cheers

 blackburn	sonney2k: sorry things go busy, will clean up gsoc ideas on samstag and sonntag ;)
-!- n4nd0 [~fjig@grey-01.csc.kth.se] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: hey, what's up?
 n4nd0	blackburn: hey! how is it going? :)
 blackburn	n4nd0: fine, but pretty busy :(
 blackburn	what about you?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am fine too, not too many lectures but lot of stuff to do lately :O
 n4nd0	blackburn: so one doubt I asked soeren but I think he didn't find time to answer
 blackburn	but recall I am not an expert in boosting ;)
 n4nd0	blackburn: yeah sure, it is more about the structure of the projects actually, no about boosting itself
 n4nd0	blackburn: so I checked the class hierarchy of multiboost and my idea would be first to focus on their algorithm for adaboost
 n4nd0	blackburn: they have some other stuff apart from that
 n4nd0	blackburn: so they divide the code of their classifiers in learner and classifier classes
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	I see
 n4nd0	blackburn: those kind of details, should be respected as they are in their implementation
 n4nd0	blackburn: or adapted to shogun
 blackburn	well I guess it won't be very hard to merge it in one class
 n4nd0	it doesn't sound like a big deal at first sight
 blackburn	n4nd0: other way could provide some adapter for their code
 blackburn	I mean you could just insert their code in some multiboost folder
 blackburn	and the provide classes that use their classes
 n4nd0	blackburn: that sounds like a good idea
 blackburn	btw if you want to do some develop
 blackburn	I had one idea
 n4nd0	blackburn: sure, tell me
 blackburn	we have no mahalanobis distance
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, I have heard of it in a couple of courses :)
 blackburn	so if you are bored just implement it :)
 blackburn	ok have to go now
 n4nd0	blackburn: yes! I can do that
 n4nd0	it sounds better to start with than the boosting thing, it might be to big
 n4nd0	too big*
 blackburn	yeah sure I don't think you should do boosting right now
 blackburn	will be back later
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, thank you for the suggestion!

 blackburn	sonney2k: hey, around?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes
@sonney2k	writing the gsoc stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm exactly what I'm doing
 blackburn	sonney2k: I strongly suggest to collaborate using docs not git..
 blackburn	google docs I mean
@sonney2k	rejected
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	you just say what you work on and I tell you what I work on
@sonney2k	no conflicts no problems
@sonney2k	and we are close to done anyway
 blackburn	ok, up to you
 blackburn	so tell me what you are doing
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you do application by yourself?
@sonney2k	just polish the one from last year
 blackburn	I was curious whether  you are going to apply as FML as well?
 blackburn	ehm crazy sentence
@sonney2k	no - we will just use shogun toolbox as organization
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
@sonney2k	that was confusing everyone last time
@sonney2k	blackburn, I just wrote / adjusted kernel two-sample test
 blackburn	sonney2k: so the only thing I can help is ideas?
@sonney2k	GPs/regression
 blackburn	ok I'll check it now
@sonney2k	multiclass needs some work and I will do libqp for now
 blackburn	sonney2k: C5.0 is on?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	hah heiko was just like tolstoy
 blackburn	a lot of text
 blackburn	sonney2k: what's up with alex binder?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what we need now is some more clear structure what we want to do
@sonney2k	I mean just 3 major points we want to improve
 blackburn	I guess it could be result of discussion
@sonney2k	framework
@sonney2k	accessibility to shogun (tutorial/ i/o / mloss.org integration)
@sonney2k	new methods
 blackburn	that's clear
 blackburn	to put particular focus on implementen
 blackburn	hah pretty nice language mix
@sonney2k	currently it is still a mess
@sonney2k	blackburn, please git commit / push
 blackburn	sonney2k: we have stated ambitious changes again
 blackburn	commit what?
@sonney2k	your changes
@sonney2k	ambitious changes?
@sonney2k	in what sense?
 blackburn	structured outputs
@sonney2k	multiclass/multitask/regression is incremental stuff
 blackburn	at least
@sonney2k	structured output is not that difficult if you don't do the very difficult algorithms
@sonney2k	the framwork itself is rather easy
 blackburn	sorry I don't give a fuck how it works
 blackburn	well then all is ok
 blackburn	it is not very clear for me what are the things you want to improve
@sonney2k	did you git push?
 blackburn	the only thing I did is added chris' idea
 blackburn	what exactly you want me to push? ;)
@sonney2k	you said you were working on this
@sonney2k	if not ok - then I am restructuring completely
 blackburn	yes I started to make draft application
 blackburn	but you said you will
@sonney2k	we have to wait until gsoc interface is open then we have access to the application from last year
@sonney2k	ideas list is for now most important
 blackburn	ehm you have one in papers folder?
@sonney2k	could be
 blackburn	GSoC2011
 blackburn	I am pretty sure :)
@sonney2k	then I checked it in :)
* sonney2k well done
 blackburn	hah I thought you navigate better than me here :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think we need more ideas?
 blackburn	the problem is ideas~mentors and we have not much :(
@sonney2k	alexander binder, vojtech franc, arthur gretton, chris widmer, oliver stegle, me
@sonney2k	how many do you want?
 blackburn	well.. no idea
@sonney2k	so we can target 6 slots/students
 blackburn	yes, looks like
 blackburn	sonney2k: will jmlr reviews be sent to me when it is ready?
@sonney2k	yes in 6 months or so :)
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	I understand it now :D
 blackburn	I don't really wait already
 blackburn	let it be surprise hah
 blackburn	sonney2k: I asked vojtech about combining ECOC and the way he did in his 2002 paper
 blackburn	(genuine MC SVM)
 blackburn	do you think it is interesting too?
 blackburn	okay back to ideas
 blackburn	I've been thinking we have to do a lot of things here
 blackburn	buuuut looks like not too much
@sonney2k	blackburn, please git pull
@sonney2k	and tell me what you think
@sonney2k	I think we have everthing in now
@sonney2k	multiclass task should include also the nips papers I mentioned
@sonney2k	and we should have some general instructions for students how to apply / what to provide
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think examples/tutorial could be a project?
 blackburn	have doubts in it
@sonney2k	of course
@sonney2k	lots of programming effort
 blackburn	hmm may be
@sonney2k	and IMHO the most intersting
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	one gets to know all machine learning algorithms in shogun
@sonney2k	writes examles for them
@sonney2k	and generates toy data + some story how these work when they should be used
 blackburn	okay I'll modify multicalss part
 blackburn	a little later
@sonney2k	is the structure now more clear?
 blackburn	with tree learning part as well
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	with my short summary at the top
@sonney2k	improve in 3 ways...
@sonney2k	accessibility / frameworks / ml algos
@sonney2k	I am jsut not sure whether I should put GPs / multitask into framwork or new ML :)
 blackburn	I don't expect any framework work :) on GPs..
 blackburn	no idea about multitask yet
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you ever worked on svms with reject option?
@sonney2k	no - is there any difference to multiclass?
 blackburn	???????
 blackburn	probably
 blackburn	sonney2k: i.e. when you have no examples that should be rejected - you can't do it as multiclass
 blackburn	so, the only way I find is to threshold (<w,x>+b) < T
@sonney2k	btw, what is your accuracy now?
 blackburn	max is still 97.32%
@sonney2k	did you try wikings stuff yet?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	~97.1%
 blackburn	but linear
@sonney2k	so with liblinear?
 blackburn	not really
@sonney2k	but?
@sonney2k	nice
 blackburn	I didn't manage to use liblinear
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	no multiclass :)
@sonney2k	why don't you do OVR?
 blackburn	I was working on generic OvR class last weekend
 blackburn	but not finished
 blackburn	btw vojtech gave me some insight
 blackburn	why genuine mc svm works better
 blackburn	do you know?
@sonney2k	scaling mostly I would guess
 blackburn	yeah exactly
 blackburn	I didn't know it
@sonney2k	but it is rare
@sonney2k	rarely better
 blackburn	0.3% for me
 blackburn	I mean GMNP is +0.3% :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: about wikings stuff - it works well
@sonney2k	I guess I should try it too
@sonney2k	0.3% is nothing :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure
 blackburn	sonney2k: I didn't try multiscale hog yet as well
 blackburn	I expect some improvement too
 blackburn	sonney2k: liblinear has cramer-singer learning but I have no idea how to attach it
 blackburn	do you?
@sonney2k	well you have to read their code :)
 blackburn	good suggestion
 blackburn	pretty painful :)
@sonney2k	and then whenever they access an example call shogun's corresponding dotfeature function
@sonney2k	problem is that they modify data internally (sometimes multiply by label or so)
@sonney2k	so this has to be done on-the-fly
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is how I did it with liblinear/ocas/libsvm/GMNPSVM/...
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw what is better? ocas vs liblinear?
@sonney2k	then in the end compare if the result is the same for same input and if just done :)
@sonney2k	depends
 blackburn	on what?
@sonney2k	liblinear is faster but may not converge as nicely
 blackburn	I have seen there is mc ocas too
@sonney2k	and doesn't need that much memory
@sonney2k	if you can afford it use mc ocas
 blackburn	so ocas could converge better?
@sonney2k	much more robust
 blackburn	hmm
@sonney2k	blackburn, how many dims do you have?
@sonney2k	how many examples?
 blackburn	39209 train examples
@sonney2k	so basically nothing
 blackburn	2700 dim
@sonney2k	then it doesn't matter
@sonney2k	also nothing
@sonney2k	anything will work
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	hmm I guess time to try virtuals
@sonney2k	(recall that I trained on 50 million examples with ~10 million dims with both)
 blackburn	no idea how did you do that
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I hardly can wait 30K seconds it trains
@sonney2k	for 40k examples / 10k dims training should take maybe 10s
@sonney2k	(except for too large C)
 blackburn	hmm may be you mean 2 class problem
@sonney2k	how many classes do you have?
 blackburn	43
 blackburn	strange..
@sonney2k	then 430 seconds max :)
 blackburn	linear?
 blackburn	or kernel?
@sonney2k	linear of course
@sonney2k	kernel is slow
 blackburn	both GMNP and Larank takes 30K
 blackburn	yes I didn't manage to do linear yet
@sonney2k	blackburn, with larank you could run it in one pass mode though
 blackburn	 how many passes does it do by default?
@sonney2k	until convergence
@sonney2k	many
 blackburn	but why can I do one?
@sonney2k	performance might be owrse
@sonney2k	worse
@sonney2k	no idea how much ...
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	okay I have to finish generic ovr thing
 blackburn	no idea how did I broke it :(
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is COFFIN in shogun?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah you should really try OVR ....... I would expect it will give very similar results
 blackburn	sure
@sonney2k	DotFeatures
 blackburn	ah I thought so
@sonney2k	virtual examples have to be programmed independently though...
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	btw I am just upgrading to debian unstable...
@sonney2k	lets see if shogun still works on this
 blackburn	well I use ubuntu 11.10
 blackburn	can it be considered as debian unstable?
@sonney2k	I am a bit scared of gnome 3.x now
 blackburn	I used to scary unity
 blackburn	but works now
 blackburn	no more butthurt
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	so you work with unity?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	heh so lets see if I can get used to gnome3 then
 blackburn	I believe it would become ok gradually

 blackburn	sonney2k: hah did multiclass thing in python in 15 mins
@sonney2k	yeah python makes life soo easy
 blackburn	makes mind flow
 blackburn	but in C++ makes headache
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok lets check if your 430s is right :)
@sonney2k	liblinear with eps 1e-2 !

@sonney2k	blackburn in which sense?
 blackburn	sonney2k: in means of train time
 blackburn	I never thought it is SO fast
 blackburn	hah
@sonney2k	and what about accuracy?
 blackburn	I tried with reduced train set
@sonney2k	bah
 blackburn	was quite similar
 blackburn	now computing with whole train set
@sonney2k	I am a bit lost with this gnome 3 thing here ... wonder how I can choose a better theme and get my hotkeys back to work...
 blackburn	damn!
 blackburn	out of memory
 blackburn	I shall remove reading images as well as hogs
 blackburn	no idea about gnome 3 :)
 blackburn	okay will continue tomorrow
 blackburn	I'll let you know
 blackburn	if get same 97% with liblinear :)
 blackburn	see you
@sonney2k	ok
