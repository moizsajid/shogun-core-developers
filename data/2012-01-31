@sonney2k	blackburn, done
 blackburn	sonney2k: done with snapshot?
@sonney2k	btw we have 2 new potential mentors
 blackburn	who?
@sonney2k	one willing to mentor GP integration
@sonney2k	olivier stegle
 blackburn	gaussian processes?
@sonney2k	and one for doing structured output framework
 blackburn	nice!
@sonney2k	nico goernitz
 blackburn	nico
@sonney2k	I don't think we should have more
 blackburn	hmm he is from tuebingen too?
@sonney2k	berlin
@sonney2k	olivier is from tuebingen
 blackburn	heh full of germans
 blackburn	ok

 blackburn	sonney2k: http://mloss.org/software/view/372/
@sonney2k	blackburn, you should make the description a list
 blackburn	sonney2k: does it support html?
@sonney2k	and add pca / kpca
@sonney2k	no but markdown syntax
 blackburn	sonney2k: how to describe unordered list with this syntax?
@sonney2k	google :)
@sonney2k	but IIRC
@sonney2k	- a
@sonney2k	- b
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay thanks
 blackburn	sonney2k: we got some doubts about our abstract
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please judge it? :)
 blackburn	there is a double SHOGUN referring
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw double affiiliations won't work with jmlr
@sonney2k	tell that to chris
@sonney2k	he can only use one
 blackburn	cwidmer: ^
@sonney2k	and the other as footnote
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding abstract don't use SHOGUn twice
@sonney2k	just write with bindings
 blackburn	We combine speed with ease of use, as our implementations are in C++, while providing bindings to other common languages such as Python, MATLAB, Octave, Java, Ruby, Lua, C\#.
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	hm
 blackburn	with bindings
 blackburn	the problem is we can't say we wrote bindings :)
-!- f-x [~user@117.192.208.79] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	blackburn, you don't say that you wrote them - you only say these are provided
 blackburn	so how to say it better
 blackburn	with provided bndings?
@sonney2k	good as is
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	thnaks
@sonney2k	no porblom
@sonney2k	scnr :D
 blackburn	hah
 f-x	blackburn, sonney2k, you guys here? hi everybody!
 blackburn	f-x: hi, sure, we were talking :)
 f-x	yeah hello there blackburn! :) been a while actually
@sonney2k	so f-x wassup?
 f-x	hi sonney2k, been going through the exciting 1.1.0 over the last couple of days
 f-x	not gone too deep yet, just doing it a bit slow. time management and all required a bit
 blackburn	just like old times on #shogun
 f-x	me being slow? :) yeah, it is!
 f-x	actually was thinking of some short/medium-term plan which you guys might have
 f-x	so i could get myself back on track a bit
 f-x	anything, sonney2k, blackburn?
@sonney2k	f-x, well you could continue your vw / shogun interaction
 blackburn	oh
 f-x	sonney2k: that's the aim. thought i might need some kind of a familarity phase seeing the changes shogun has undergone
 blackburn	well we have a lot of ideas..
@sonney2k	f-x, none really in the online feature stuff
@sonney2k	f-x, so you as the author should easily be able to continue
 f-x	ah alright then.. i'll think of some kind of road map
 f-x	good to know, sonney2k
 f-x	and blackburn you're welcome to suggest ideas in core shogun too if you need some help
@sonney2k	f-x, of course if you are looking for easy tasks you could aswell translate a new linear svm solver from octave to c++ :)
 blackburn	f-x: yes I would formulate some if you need some tasks
 f-x	sonney2k: sure, anything.. i want to have a brief spell so i know how to organize my time with work/shogun/other activities
 blackburn	f-x: have you seen we -> to github issues?
 f-x	go ahead, blackburn..
 f-x	and a nope to that question
@sonney2k	f-x, the newton svm for example http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html#newtonsvm
 blackburn	you should check, we have wrote down some ideas (https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)
 blackburn	too briefly but we can discuss
@sonney2k	f-x, it really depends on what you want to do
@sonney2k	we also need e.g. multiclass machines
@sonney2k	or some image related features
@sonney2k	(hog, ...)
 blackburn	sonney2k: hey I do not like integrating hog here
@sonney2k	f-x, so if you have an application in mind or some preferences let us know
 f-x	sonney2k: at this moment, mainly something to get used to the new 'style' of shogun, if it has changed recently
 blackburn	sonney2k: we would end with doing our own OS :D
@sonney2k	f-x, style didn't change
 f-x	eg. how we moved on to SGVector, SGMatrix etc.. things like that
 f-x	and memory management, eg.SG_MALLOC
@sonney2k	f-x, we converted most of the code now
@sonney2k	to use SGVector/Matrix etc
@sonney2k	and everything uses SG_MALLOC
@sonney2k	but that's mostly it
 f-x	nice.. i'll look at some code to get a feel of it.. and probably that SVM should be ok for starters
@sonney2k	some bigger changes requiring newer versions of swig / python that are not really user visible (but faster - hopefully more elegant)
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah that would certainly be an easy job
 f-x	sonney2k, perfect
 f-x	i'll get started on it tomorrow. good to have some kind of plan now.. thanks!
@sonney2k	np :)
@sonney2k	I am getting tired already *yawn*
 blackburn	sonney2k: lets pray for my paper before going sleep :D
 f-x	our prayers are with you, blackburn
 f-x	and the issues page is so nice
 blackburn	f-x: hah :)
 blackburn	f-x: I'm trying to present my collection of algorithms as toolkit to JMLR mloss
 f-x	blackburn, seriously amazing stuff
 f-x	you have it more or less ready?
 blackburn	f-x: what is ready?
 f-x	the paper?
 blackburn	ah yes
@sonney2k	...~~~ooooOOOO~mighty~jmlr~editors~~~select~the~dumbest~ignorant~and~easiest~to~excite~reviewers~for~~~~ohh~our~dear~blackburn~~~OOOOoooooo~~~...
 blackburn	I hope to submit it today
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I got afraid of the message above
 f-x	looked like some weird map in nethack
* sonney2k is going to compose a song for blackburn named "praising the reviewers"
 blackburn	sonney2k: seriously I've read reviews for shogun mloss paper and it makes me think they would say 'who are you guy? what is that shit?'
 f-x	i say you'd do just fine, anyway your efforts are really appreciable, blackburn
 blackburn	hah I hope so
@sonney2k	blackburn, you will get a mixture of the above (reviewers)
@sonney2k	alright f-x, blackburn - nice meeting you again. time to sleep for me
@sonney2k	cu
 blackburn	see you
 f-x	see you sonney2k
 blackburn	no idea what do you mean mixture of the above :)
 f-x	your opinion and my opinion, i think he meant
 blackburn	ah
 f-x	mixed reviews :)
 blackburn	would be nice to not having mixture of 'who fucking are you?' and 'what is the shit you present?' :D
 blackburn	f-x: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/lisitsyn12a.pdf that's a current presubmit draft
 f-x	hehe i'm sure they won't use those words _exactly_ :)
 f-x	ooh lemme see
 blackburn	ahha yeah sure
 f-x	wow blackburn, did you meet cwidmer?
 blackburn	f-x: not really, why I'd have to?
 f-x	just curious
 f-x	naah, just a question which struck me
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	I've never been abroad actually :D
 f-x	blackburn, me neither :-/
 f-x	blackburn: nice page of edrt you have there
 blackburn	ugly :)
 f-x	looks like a proper research page :)
 blackburn	f-x: btw feel free to do any remarks
 blackburn	looks pretty raw for me still
 f-x	blackburn, lack of energy and a dire lack of knowledge mean i can't make any comments regarding the content yet
 f-x	but i actually thought the overall 'feel' is quite good
 blackburn	:) I see, no problem
 f-x	and btw blackburn, you know why we capitalize SHOGUN? does it stand for anything?
 blackburn	f-x: Soeren + Gunnar
 blackburn	no idea why SHO
 blackburn	sounds better :)
 f-x	Shoeren :)
 f-x	yeah
 blackburn	SH?GUN
 blackburn	hah
 f-x	good performance too, i see (edrt)
 blackburn	well should be best
 blackburn	but sklearn is too fast on toy data
 blackburn	and matlab is going fast too on high-dim data
 blackburn	well it will be faster later
 f-x	but its terrible in isomap (sklearn)
 blackburn	not really terrible
 f-x	2-3 times slower
 f-x	oh i have to sleep now.. but looking good so far blackburn. all the best with it
 blackburn	f-x: thanks! sleep well
 f-x	see you
