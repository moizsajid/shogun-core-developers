 CaBa	are there any examples on the spectrum rbf kernels available anywhere?

 ephas	Hi, if I use ROCEvaluation during cross validation, I am able to extract the mean AUC using ".mean".  I was wondering if there was a way to extract the tp/fp matrix you get from the get_ROC function, i.e. I am after the cross validated get_ROC matrix (I can only seem to extract the tp/fp matrix from the last fold and not the averaged matrix).  I hope this makes sense?
 ephas	The reason I am after this matrix is that I would like to draw an ROC curve from the cross validated results.
 ephas	PS: I'm using the Python interface
 lisitsyn	ephas: hey
 lisitsyn	yeah I got your problem
 lisitsyn	let me check
 ephas	@lisitsyn - thanks!
 lisitsyn	ephas: you need averaged matrix right?
 ephas	yes please
 lisitsyn	ok this need some hack :(
 ephas	running the .get_ROC function on the metric returns the matrix corresponding to the last fold
 ephas	ah - is the hack doable?
 lisitsyn	.. in progress :)
 lisitsyn	let me check again
 lisitsyn	ephas: what about running it only once so that last fold is the only one?
 lisitsyn	and then again and again
 lisitsyn	then manually compute mean ROC
 ephas	I was thinking about that, but I couldn't work out how to calculate the mean matrix when the dimensions differ across folds (or is this consistent? ... I've not checked)
 lisitsyn	ephas: I think they should match
 ephas	ok - I'll have a quick look and let you know how I get on
 ephas	thanks for your help so far btw
 lisitsyn	np, I'll try to help if any other issues occur
