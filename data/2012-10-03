 blackburn	hey n4nd0
 blackburn	managed to get this linking thing to disappear?
 n4nd0	blackburn: no :(
 blackburn	argh
 n4nd0	I have no idea how to fix that kind of problem
 n4nd0	I saw a similar one today

 adoniscik	greetings! Does Shogun work compile with EPD?
 blackburn	adoniscik: hey
 adoniscik	hey blackburn. That's the Enthought Python distribution.
 blackburn	yeah, thanks
 blackburn	well it should work with it since it works with basic python
 blackburn	adoniscik: I didn't hear anything about compilation of shogun with EPD actually
 blackburn	adoniscik: just try and let us know if there are any problems
 adoniscik	there are. what does it mean if compilation of the Python test fails like http://pastebin.com/BfjrG6DH
 blackburn	adoniscik: okay lets try to get rid of it.. when does that happen?
 adoniscik	during configure's python/numpy stage
 blackburn	adoniscik: do you have a configure.log saved?
 adoniscik	that's an extract i gave you; the important part
 blackburn	adoniscik: so it happens when it checks for numpy?
 adoniscik	correct. this is the error returned by running gcc on the code snippet shogun uses to test numpy
 blackburn	adoniscik: numpy developer files, right?
 adoniscik	yes. I don't know if I have it though. How can I check manually?
 adoniscik	I assume it comes with EPD but I don't know
 blackburn	adoniscik: well the error you've got tells me you have headers
 blackburn	but some linking error
 blackburn	to be honest I do not know what is so different in EPD's python
 adoniscik	that's what I thought. Is it some path problem?
 blackburn	I googled a little and it could be caused by static linking - let me check for more information
 blackburn	adoniscik: I don't think it is a path problem - rather something wrong with linking flags
 blackburn	adoniscik: I found that there was a similar problem and we already have a  workaround in configure that adds -ldl flag
 adoniscik	I think you're getting close.
 adoniscik	let me try
 blackburn	adoniscik: I mean it is already here and should work..
 blackburn	that's pretty bad it doesn't
 blackburn	adoniscik: can you paste few lines more that are before these ones?
 blackburn	what is compiler call there?
 blackburn	adoniscik: I believe that's an enthought's gap btw
 adoniscik	it's long because I managed to install all the "extras" shogun supports: cc -I. -I..   -I/usr/include/atlas -isystem /usr/include/eigen3   -fPIC -g -Wall -O9 -fexpensive-optimizations -frerun-cse-after-loop -fcse-follow-jumps -finline-functions -fschedule-insns2 -fthread-jumps -fforce-addr -fstrength-reduce -funroll-loops -mfpmath=sse -march=native -mtune=native -pthread ./configure-21993-27344.c -o ./configure-17354-27344.o  -Xlinke
 adoniscik	r --no-undefined -fno-strict-aliasing -fPIC -I/opt/enthought/include/python2.7 -I/opt/enthought/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include -shared -L/opt/enthought/lib/python2.7/config -lpython2.7 -lm -pthread -lhdf5 -llapack -lcblas -llapack_atlas -lsuperlu -lnlopt -lglpk -lm -llzo2 -lz -lbz2 -llzma
 blackburn	it looks like python was built without dl out there
 blackburn	I miss -ldl there
 blackburn	okay no ldl right?
 blackburn	adoniscik: lets try to hack it then
 blackburn	adoniscik: easiest way is to add '-ldl' in the string on the line 159 of src/configure
 blackburn	I'll report an issue meanwhile to not forget about that later
-!- heiko [~heiko@host86-183-74-52.range86-183.btcentralplus.com] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko: hey there
 adoniscik	I added it to end and I got a shorter error
 heiko	blackburn, h
 heiko	i
 heiko	how are you doing?
 blackburn	working on a test task for that job I am applying for
 blackburn	pretty fun - I had to gimp a little: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/ml/horses-snow_with_skates.jpg
 heiko	wtf?
 heiko	gimp sketches for a job? :)
 blackburn	heh okay okay
 blackburn	they asked me to kinda reverse engineer
 blackburn	https://imagecategorizer.services.open.xerox.com/
 blackburn	that thing
 blackburn	that's where crazy pictures came from
 blackburn	I also have an inverted earth that looks like and is categorized like an oyster :D
 heiko	reverse engeneer?
 adoniscik	blackburn: adding ldl gave http://pastebin.com/S6nSvysR
 blackburn	adoniscik: closer!
 adoniscik	yes, indeed, thank you! now we have to deal with libpython?
 blackburn	adoniscik: -lutil please then too
 blackburn	heiko: well like to describe how could it work
 adoniscik	you da man!
 heiko	blackburn, alright
 heiko	image classification that is ight?
 heiko	right?
 blackburn	heiko: yes, multi-label
 blackburn	heiko: I've made a 5 page long report already and keeping on
 blackburn	have two days more to think and write
 heiko	wow
 heiko	and?
 heiko	what are you describing?
 adoniscik	sorry to butt in... so which lines in the configuration script should I amend?
 blackburn	adoniscik: right next to -ldl I think
 blackburn	heiko: well I believe it is the thing that won ILSVRC 2011 (xerox guys again)
 blackburn	heiko: horse with skates is recognized as winter sports, hockey and donkey
 heiko	I see
 heiko	wow
 blackburn	so I kinda state that it is a local patch based
 heiko	thats pretty good isnt it
 heiko	which means?
 blackburn	SIFT/SURF, etc
 blackburn	so it basically counts visual words
 blackburn	skates, some white areas
 blackburn	so the approach in a nutshell is local patches + BoW (bag of words) or Fisher vectors
 blackburn	and then SVM
 blackburn	may be some improvements along but I believe it works like that
 blackburn	a few evidences already
-!- zxtx [~zv@ip-64-134-226-61.public.wayport.net] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	heiko: the system works pretty well, yes
 blackburn	it fails terribly with cats though
 heiko	ok
 blackburn	I can't stand that
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	we did something similar in our MV class
 heiko	these visual words are pretty cool I think
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	heiko: xerox owns a few patents about visual words
 blackburn	context-dependent is of some interest I think
 blackburn	I am unsure it works well already though - in the end it recognizes paris+london in the same pic
 blackburn	or donkey+hockey
 heiko	sounds like you will get the job :D
 blackburn	heh why?
 adoniscik	the python_static compiled! do you need SWIG to compile python_modular
 blackburn	adoniscik: yeah, swig is required only for python_modular
 blackburn	static does not require swig at all
 adoniscik	okay so that's why it failed that part; will fix quickly
 blackburn	heiko: alex helped me quite a lot too - I asked him
 blackburn	he is the expert in this field you know
 heiko	blackburn, because you sound competent
 heiko	alex?
 blackburn	binder
 heiko	I see
 heiko	nice
 blackburn	btw may be you have ideas too - feel free to share :)
 blackburn	heiko: that job would mean I won't be gsoc student next summer but rather mentor
 heiko	blackburn, I am not really fit in MV, sorry :)
 heiko	well I think that would be better anyway :D
 heiko	more mentore=more students
 heiko	= more SHOGUN :)
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	and I feel like a ship captain sometimes so it would not be hard for me
 blackburn	heiko: that company is like the only one having consistent salaries around there
 heiko	consistent?
 blackburn	well I am now having less than 1/10 of gsoc per month
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	not really reasonable
 adoniscik	blackburn: I got both python interfaces to compile. I added the two flags to LINKFLAGS_PYTHON in the configure script. Perhaps it should detect EPD and take care of it automatically in a future release?
 blackburn	adoniscik: exactly
 heiko	blackburn, wow
 heiko	maybe come to london and earn 50k punds a year :)
 heiko	with your skills, you could easily do that
 adoniscik	Is there anything I can do to help or will you take care of it?
 heiko	pounds
 blackburn	adoniscik: I issued an issue :) we shouldn't lost that
 heiko	and thats the wages for machine learners here
 blackburn	adoniscik: well I'll test if it would work without any bugs/warnings when we forcely add -ldl and -lutil there
 blackburn	on usual python
 blackburn	and then add that to the master thing
 blackburn	I will do that now
 blackburn	heiko: I have runglish
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	blackburn, youll pick that up quickly - also some of the people here speak such a bad english, you are probably better
 blackburn	heiko: I do not have speaking practice at all..
 blackburn	heiko: btw is that true in germany people care about pronunciation?
 blackburn	I rather meant accent
 heiko	how do you  mean that?
 blackburn	I heard like it is hard to get job if you speak like russian invader :D
 heiko	that depends on the place
 heiko	but that might be true
 heiko	London --since much more international-- is less strict about that
 blackburn	heh I see
 heiko	you could also do a 2 week course or so
 heiko	I bet you would pick up things quickly
 blackburn	yeah I hope so
 heiko	blackburn, I visited the Google offices in London today
 heiko	that is an *awesome* place
 blackburn	yeah, I've seen photos
 blackburn	I am acknowledged with one guy
 blackburn	who works there
 blackburn	former netcracker job and SSAU university (just like me)
 blackburn	may be I will be able to get on that lane too :)
 heiko	yeah :)
 heiko	unfortunately no data analysis or software engineering in London
 heiko	only business
 blackburn	really?
 blackburn	I thought he is a software developer
 heiko	a friend of mine applied to Mountain View, CA and is going for an interview next week
 heiko	well, only minor
 heiko	I did only see well-dressed women,    no nerds :)
 blackburn	heiko: google interview is a hell
 heiko	blackburn, dont know. what is it like?
 blackburn	heiko: one guy from St. petersburg who were applying for GSoC 2011 tried
 blackburn	(I talk to him sometimes)
 blackburn	it was like 6 hours of questions, questions, questions
 blackburn	tasks and more tasks
 blackburn	so in the end there were like two accept and one reject
 blackburn	and he was unfortunately rejected
 blackburn	software engineering position that was
 heiko	oh wow
 blackburn	heiko: well didn't you heard of their crazy questions like what is a cost of washing all windows in seattle?
 blackburn	this way they check how one thinks
 heiko	how many ping pong balls do fit into a Swimming Pool?
 heiko	these are easy
 heiko	you just have to structure the answer a bit
 blackburn	well yes, not hard
 heiko	I would be more afraid of technical questions
 blackburn	heiko: that company I am applying to gave me a brainbench C++ test
 blackburn	on the interview
 heiko	meaning?
 blackburn	they are lazy to check whether one knows C++ I guess :)
 blackburn	sonney2k's STL hate played a bad role there, I've got sth like 74% percentile
 heiko	what is that?
 heiko	ah stl
 heiko	what did you have to do?
 blackburn	http://brainbench.com/ that is the site
 blackburn	well just some test like
 blackburn	what is wrong there
 blackburn	and some code with algorithms and STD
 blackburn	or what will be outputted after the running of the following code
 blackburn	etc
 heiko	ah I see
 heiko	yeah I only know the containers of the STL :)
 blackburn	heiko: it is not that ugly I think
 heiko	I actually like them
 heiko	I mean
 heiko	what else to use? :)
 heiko	there is nothing
 heiko	in shogun we got the base-class so things are different
 heiko	and we want to serialise
 heiko	btw any new ideas for the SGReferenced problem and serialization?
 blackburn	I do not like things without alternative (we have president here for 12 years already :D)
 blackburn	not really, last days were pretty busy and I failed to even think about that
 blackburn	btw we broke things a little
 heiko	I worked a bit more on the streaming framwork for my part
 blackburn	I disabled Lua string tests for now
 heiko	ok
 blackburn	but streaming features fail in python
 blackburn	with segmentation fault
 heiko	jep probably my fault
 heiko	sorry
 blackburn	probably I caused that somehow
 heiko	will catch up with that this week
 heiko	was in germany over the weekend
 blackburn	i changed something out there too
 heiko	I made some streaming features run again in libshogun
 heiko	this code btw
 heiko	is not really well written
 blackburn	we just need to bisect a problem
 blackburn	valgrind error appears to be strange
 blackburn	heiko: *tss* shogun is not really well written in general :D
 heiko	blackburn, LOL :)
 blackburn	however proprietary business things are much worse
 heiko	yeah we are at least open-source so people find problems
 blackburn	heiko: did you ever work with some proprietary code for say java or sth like that?
 heiko	yes
 heiko	horrow
 heiko	I once tried to use a commercial software for graph visualization in java
 heiko	that was the worst library I ever came across with :D
 blackburn	heiko: I support that kind of code at job day by day
 heiko	finally, we decided to re-implement it ourselves
 blackburn	I thank all gods that we are migrated to SVN instead of clearcase
 heiko	I think its dangerous if one doesnt pay enough attention to well written code which is hack-free
 heiko	because all the errors come back and steal your time
 blackburn	yeah that's our mistake as well
 heiko	indeed
 heiko	too many quick changes
 heiko	and stopping at 95%
 heiko	thats bad on the long run
 heiko	anyway
 blackburn	adoniscik: still around?
 heiko	I  should write unit-tests instead complaining :D
-!- zxtx [~zv@ip-64-134-226-61.public.wayport.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
 blackburn	I am thinking where to put these -ldl -lutil things
 blackburn	heiko: btw about these 50k pounds - isn't that near to sum one spends living in london?
 blackburn	you told me and I heard that it is crazy expensive
 adoniscik	yes, sorry to overhear! there's a slight problem with nlopt which I'll write about in a sec
 adoniscik	it fails with /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libnlopt.a(optimize.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.text' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
 adoniscik	/usr/local/lib/libnlopt.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
 adoniscik	I found a mention of this error in http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2896
 blackburn	right right
 blackburn	adoniscik: did you compile nlopt by yourself?
 heiko	blackburn, me and my girlfriend, we live on about 1800 pounds a month
 adoniscik	err, no. Should I?
 heiko	so much less
 blackburn	adoniscik: where it comes from?
 blackburn	EPD too?
 blackburn	if you don't mind compilation of another package (pretty simple for nlopt) you could do that
 blackburn	it requires -fPIC to be linked properly but for some reason nlopt ignores that in binary and source (by default)
 adoniscik	yes EPD
 adoniscik	I mean wait no
 adoniscik	I downloaded it myself I think.
 adoniscik	and stuffed it in /usr/lib
 adoniscik	right. so what should I compile?
 blackburn	just download nlopt sources, set -fPIC option, recompile and install
 blackburn	I am currently trying to find how to set -fPIC there
 adoniscik	okay. I only downloaded it manually because I couldn't find an nlopt package for Ubuntu
 adoniscik	in the software center
 blackburn	yeah, there is no yet
 blackburn	adoniscik: just do
 blackburn	./configure --enable-shared
 blackburn	make
 blackburn	sudo make install
