 abdi	Hi, good afternoon
 abdi	Now, I am using Shogun Toolbox Java Modular interface for completing my course.
 abdi	I have a problem in compiling the example
 abdi	There are some error, one of them is cannot find symbol RealFeature constructor with DoubleMatrix argument
 abdi	I compile mkl_multiclassification
 abdi	How can I solve it ?
 sonne|work	moin everone
 sonne|work	abdi: other examples work right?
 abdi	i have tried for another example. I want to use mkl_multiclass. I guess that the error is in the java code
 abdi	Sorry, I mean I haven't tried for another example
 sonne|work	abdi: then try another one
 abdi	yes, I am trying for another one
 abdi	I have tried for another one. The same error : cannot find symbol Real Feature constructor with Double Matrix argument
 abdi	Is there any suggestion or solution ?

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, how are you doing?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: any updates on the markdown thing? shall we put it live?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I updated it yesterday, not sure if you see
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, the script now uses the Shogun directory set in shogun/settings to start looking for md files, or a given directory

 besser82	thoralf: that would pre-require all people are able to read that  ;)
 besser82	thoralf: and it usually is easier to find a similar sound in the one's native  ;)
 thoralf	Best is to have concurrent implementations. ;)

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: cool
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: so should I put it live today?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, we can merge that but it won't appear in the webpage directly, we have to put links to the md files somewhere
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: maybe you add some links that show them
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, yep. Any suggestion where to put them?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I mean sth like /readme/ or so
 sonne|work	for the moment
@iglesiasg	ah yeah
@iglesiasg	that should work right away
 sonne|work	later we have to integrate it more properly
@iglesiasg	if you do
@iglesiasg	shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/readme
 sonne|work	ahh cool
@iglesiasg	and the other ones like readme_cmake, readme_developer
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, so put it live when you a second and let's test that they go fine
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I will do this evening
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, but the util/markdown.py script should be executed first!
@iglesiasg	otherwise the html files are not created
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and then we run this regulary w/ cron right?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: or in the nightly_default
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, cron?
@iglesiasg	but yes sure, the idea is to run that one regularly to update the html files with the updates in the md files

@wiking	yes
 besser82	wiking: shouldn't ccache actually be used automaticaly used, if installed?
@wiking	well it was like that
 besser82	wiking: i mean there shouldn't be no need to explicitly set that in cmake...
@wiking	well it's not used automatically for sure in many os-es
@wiking	even if it's installed
 besser82	wiking: which ones? except that OSCrap or M$ WinShit
@wiking	any bsd
@wiking	and any osx
@wiking	so basically non linux
 besser82	wiking: if someone uses bsd, shouldn't he be smart enough to set that up to default?
 besser82	wiking: OSCrap users are usually not smart enough...
@wiking	no
@wiking	it has nothing to do with smartness on the user's side
@wiking	it's about common sense of a package creator
 besser82	wiking: "common sense" <--- i like that phrase ;)
 besser82	wiking: i just found that "double using" ccaches slows things down...
 besser82	wiking: like da: /usr/bin/ccache /usr/lib/ccache/cc
 besser82	wiking: so guess i should make that conditional in cmake
