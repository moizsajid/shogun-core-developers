@sonney2k	n4nd0, sure
@sonney2k	send it around
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok
 n4nd0	do you prefer just a link to the page or info embedded in the mail + link
 n4nd0	I like the second more
 n4nd0	lazy people who don't want to visit the link will see it anyway then :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, second option :)
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: you were going to talk to c-base people today, weren't you?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I forgot :/
@sonney2k	14th is the next possible date
 n4nd0	hehe ok
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I can try to remind you through IRC if you want ;)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, anyway asking for feedback about our program draft is certainly a good idea
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, will do that on the mailing list soon then
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I will hopefully talk w/ gunnar next week too.
@sonney2k	nite
 n4nd0	good night

 sumit	Hey Blackburn ,  This is what my action plan should boil down to implementing much of the neural network toolbox (matlab)  , and the other nitty gritty of simulating neural networks ( cognitron,neocognitron,cohonen layer and various  other models/concepts in ANNs)
 blackburn	hey
 sumit	u there blackburn?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	that's pretty big, anything particular to start with?
 sumit	Yes it is!will have to start from the basic ones , that was just a gist of all that can be worked out , will have to progress step by step,,,probably with adaline/madaline and far beyond then
 blackburn	what is especially hot is deep learning things
 sumit	Besides, I shall appreciate if rather you,as well let me know what shogun expects/desires in this particular field
 sumit	Yes I agree , U talking about learning techniques?
 blackburn	may be it would be nice to have something like that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine
 sumit	Nice!the mathematics is never an affront once you get the grasp and feel at ease to code upon , I appreciate if rather you suggest me topics,like this,thanks,I ll make a note of it,,What else?
 sumit	this seems very much analogous to hopfield networks
 blackburn	yes it seems so
 blackburn	well it could be a good start
 blackburn	I have no more ideas so far but I'll let you know
 blackburn	(if I get any)
 sumit	yes cool , very promising :)
 blackburn	I am not an expert in neural stuff but RBM seems to be something nice to have
 sumit	So basically,shogun(development)  is interested in rendering modules more robust,and intelligent,this is a wonderful concept,I shall work upon it,and keep you posted about this
 sumit	Dont worry,,count on me for Neural networks :P (though I wasn't acquainted with RBM before,neva mind :) )
 blackburn	we actually shall discuss our todos soon
 blackburn	to come with ideas for gsoc
 sumit	sure
 sumit	as you please,I will for the time being spend some time on RBM
 blackburn	that's nice
 sumit	:) all right blackburn,shall let you know about this :) shall get back to you soon :),,
 blackburn	okay sure

@sonney2k	blackburn, one more idea about the submission form - we should ask about the level: ML beginner, expert - maybe in some better words like 'have trained a GP/SVM/NN done PCA/...)
