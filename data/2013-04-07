@sonney2k	blackburn, then I don't understand what you are trying to do
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am trying to come with internal DSL that fits our needs
@sonney2k	blackburn, so 'just' the getter/setter part with domain/ranges?
 blackburn	what I developed now - yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it was quite untrivial to handle types under the hood
 blackburn	so it was not 'just' for me :D
