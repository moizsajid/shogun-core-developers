@lambday	wiking: matrix pow/exp or element-wise pow/exp?
@wiking	both
@lambday	wiking: I added element-wise things a few days back.. but matrix pow/log etc things are not there yet
@lambday	wiking: btw  we'd love to hear your comments on this issue - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3032
@lambday	I agree with HeikoS that it might be an overkill.. but it would have its own benefits as well I assume
@lambday	wiking: check this : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/mathematics/linalg/ElementwiseOperations_unittest.cc
@lambday	wiking: this one is cool - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/mathematics/linalg/ElementwiseOperations_unittest.cc#L301

@lambday	argh
@lambday	http://pastebin.com/pVgtUa4m
@lambday	wiking: ^
@wiking	for example yes
@lambday	wiking: that's the only thing I can see there.. and IIRC it's a well known issue with omp and valgrind.. it says "possibly" lost.. so not exactly a memory leak I suppose..
@lambday	anyway I'll check some more
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@untrust-out.swc.ucl.ac.uk] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	there are ways to silent valgrind about this
@wiking	see shogun/configs/valgrind.supp
@lambday	okay
@wiking	btw based on that
@wiking	some omp stuff are silenced already
@lambday	seems like it should be suppressed with this.. it already has this pthread_create@@GLIBC_* thingi
@lambday	but it didn't
@lambday	and I can see the same error but originated at somewhere else... so maybe the suppression didn't work
@lambday	e.g. FITCInferenceMethod_get_marginal_likelihood_derivatives_Test::TestBody() (FITCInferenceMethod_unittest.cc:542) --> shogun::CInferenceMethod::get_negative_log_marginal_likelihood_derivatives(shogun::CMap&lt;shogun::TParameter*, shogun::CSGObject*&gt;*) (InferenceMethod.cpp:241)
@HeikoS	wiking: hey, can you explain me how this eigen3 thing got merged?
@lambday	HeikoS: hey
@HeikoS	lambday: hi
@HeikoS	lambday: kind of late for you isnt it? ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: all good?
@lambday	HeikoS: this is the middle of the day.. I'm at office :D
@lambday	yeah..
@HeikoS	lambday: ah really, I see
@wiking	HeikoS: it's a feature branch
@wiking	that doesn't require PR
@wiking	i squashed it
 shogun-buildbot	build #2773 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2773  blamelist: Bj?rn Esser <me@besser82.io>
@wiking	and merged it by hand
@HeikoS	wiking: I see you used the upstream feature/eigen3 thing?
@wiking	i used the latest feature/eigen3...
@wiking	tested it with travis
@HeikoS	via github ?
@HeikoS	or locally?
@wiking	all green -> squashed
@wiking	and merged
@wiking	what do you mean github?
@wiking	feature branch
-!- dungeon_master [developer@nat/iiit/x-fjpdsedccveyfldu] has quit [Ping timeout: 248 seconds]
@wiking	feature branch do not go via PR
@HeikoS	github can merge feature branches
@wiking	lol no sorry
@wiking	i use console
@HeikoS	you you checkout the feature branch
@wiking	i dont need a webui to merge a branch in
@wiking	git
@HeikoS	then go to develop, suqash and merge it, and then push to develop?
@wiking	no
@wiking	you go the feature branch
@wiking	squash it
@wiking	then go to develop
@wiking	git merge <branch>
@wiking	this is 101 git
 shogun-buildbot	build #335 of trusty - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/trusty%20-%20libshogun/builds/335
@HeikoS	thats what I just said
@HeikoS	yeah all good, just wanted the PR for discussion in src code
@wiking	no
@wiking	you didn't say that
@wiking	you said
@wiking	go to develop, suqash and merge it,
-!- wanderer_ [67157d4e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.78] has joined #shogun
@wiking	that's very different
@wiking	HeikoS: you can have discussion over a branhc
@wiking	no need for pr
@wiking	PRing branches
@wiking	will cause double compile in travis
@wiking	because it'll test it as a PR
@wiking	and it will test is as a branch
@wiking	btw https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
@HeikoS	ok I see
@HeikoS	thanks
 wanderer_	have a little doubt here with the build process, can anybody help me?
@HeikoS	anyway goo that it is in
@HeikoS	wiking: these have eigen3 things were annoying
@wiking	yep
@wiking	now it's done
@HeikoS	saw all the code I deleted? all these hand implemented matrix multiplications
@wiking	answer for my email
@HeikoS	just reading
 wanderer_	how do you enable c++11 while building?
 wanderer_	in shogun cmake
@wiking	wanderer_: cmake will autodetect your compiler
@wiking	if you wanna use a different compiler
@wiking	just set CC and CXX
@wiking	env vars
@wiking	just as in any configure script
 wanderer_	yeah, but is there a way to do that in cmake itself?
@wiking	what?
@wiking	to do what?
 wanderer_	force use of g++/gcc-4.9
@wiking	CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 cmake ...
@HeikoS	wiking: so about cookbook
@wiking	done
@HeikoS	wiking: the -DBUILD_COOKBOOK is legacy
@HeikoS	currently, it is being built whenever its dependencies are met
 wanderer_	cool, thanks!
@wiking	ok but in case of travis
@HeikoS	which is sphinx is installed, and BUILD_META_EXAMPLES is set
@HeikoS	find_package(Sphinx)
@HeikoS	IF(BUILD_META_EXAMPLES AND SPHINX_FOUND)
@HeikoS	    SET(BUILD_COOKBOOK 1)
@HeikoS	ENDIF()
@wiking	that's *always*
@wiking	right?
@HeikoS	yes, needs change
@wiking	...
@wiking	putana
@HeikoS	what about re-introducing the switch? -DBUILD_COOKBOOK?
@HeikoS	and then only one travis build does it
@wiking	yeah ok i dont care
@wiking	answer for the rest
@HeikoS	develop should be fixed upload that is overwritten on merge
@wiking	what do you mean on merge?
@wiking	you do understand that travis runs
@wiking	AWLAYS
@wiking	any commit in develop
@HeikoS	anything changed in develop
@wiking	or in any other branch
@HeikoS	so I would like two things
@HeikoS	1.
@HeikoS	being able to look at the cookbook from PRs from pppl
@HeikoS	2.
@HeikoS	have the latest cookbook of "develop" somewhere
@wiking	ok both is possible
@HeikoS	3. have a release coobkook just like doxygen
@HeikoS	but 1. is most important
@HeikoS	2-3 can be cominbed in "nightly"
@wiking	no nightly
@HeikoS	wiking: question: is it ok if cookbook is always build when dependencies ar emet?
@wiking	forget that now
@wiking	no
@wiking	that's not ok
@wiking	is it part of ALL
@wiking	?
@HeikoS	ok then Ill add switch
@HeikoS	yes
@wiking	in that case no
@wiking	but if you remove from all
@wiking	then it's cool
@HeikoS	ok will do
@wiking	why does it have to be part of all?
@wiking	it's doc for god sakes
@HeikoS	yes its part of doc
@HeikoS	just saw :D
@wiking	when you do
@wiking	make all
@wiking	will it build?

@HeikoS	AH
@HeikoS	now it doesnt anymore
@HeikoS	pushing
@HeikoS	ah its a bit weird
@HeikoS	wiking: cookbook depends on meta_examples
-!- dungeon_master [developer@nat/iiit/x-cugdfgivvntmwgoh] has quit [Ping timeout: 268 seconds]
@HeikoS	wiking: pushed, it is now part of doc
@HeikoS	wiking: removed the travis flag
@HeikoS	wiking: I don't think travis runs make doc right?
@HeikoS	wiking: so you can do make cookbook and then upload
@HeikoS	wiking: all questions answered?
@HeikoS	wiking: dont know about the build. Now make doc depends on cookbook and therefore on  meta_examples, which depend on the linked shogun lib
@HeikoS	wiking: there are more problems in the build now,
 lisitsyn	where is the irc notification?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  hey
 lisitsyn	hey
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how to make 'make cookbook' part of 'make doc' but not part of 'make all'
@HeikoS	change: add_custom_target(cookbook ALL ....
@HeikoS	into
@HeikoS	add_custom_target(cookbook doc ?
@HeikoS	nope
 lisitsyn	how did it happen that cookbook is part of all?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I have no idea, think you integrated it ?
 lisitsyn	ok let me check
 lisitsyn	add_custom_target(cookbook doc
 lisitsyn	should work
@HeikoS	no doesnt
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: did you remove the cache?
 lisitsyn	i.e. build dir
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good point
@HeikoS	doing now
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	ok so cookbook is definitely part of make all
 lisitsyn	still/
 lisitsyn	?
@HeikoS	now changing to doc and it is not anymore
@HeikoS	but now make cookbook errors
@HeikoS	[100%] Cookbook Sphinx building HTML
@HeikoS	/bin/sh: 1: doc: not found
@HeikoS	this is the one in feature branch
@HeikoS	you can try it
@HeikoS	for wiking, we want to only build cookbook as part of make doc, then he will do the html upload from PRs
