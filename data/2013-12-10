 adrin	Hi, I'm having proglems compiling shogun 3 on my machine.
 adrin	the short error is like this:
 adrin	http://pastebin.com/wMGKv6Kd
 adrin	and this is my configuration:
 adrin	http://pastebin.com/KKegmJJn
@wiking	adrin: mmm python3.3
 adrin	wiking: yep, doesn't it compile under 3.3?
@wiking	you'll have problems unfortunately
 adrin	argh, I see
 besser82	adrin: I'm currently working on that CMake-stuff and do some testing with Py >= 3
 besser82	adrin: So there might be a chance to get that work within next release of Shogun...
 adrin	besser82, great, I'm not in a hurry for installing shogun right now. I can help you on testing if you wish. I guess my configuration is complex and nasty enough to be a good test case ;)
 besser82	adrin: Which OS do you use?
 besser82	adrin: Thank for your offer  :D
 adrin	this server is squeez, that's why I have almost everything installed on my alternate path, as I don't have su permission on the server.
 adrin	So gcc, python, boost, swig, cmake, pkg-config,... are installed in my accessible folder.
 besser82	adrin: Whoa! Cool! Builds from cuztom-toolchain  ;)
 adrin	and by install, I mean compiled from the last release as last week.
 besser82	adrin: so from git-checkout, right?
 adrin	yes, some from git, some last stable archived.
 adrin	pkg-config is from git for example.
 adrin	gcc is 4.8.2, downloaded as tgz from official website.
 besser82	adrin: my question was more about Shogun  ;)
 besser82	adrin: Your other stuff sounds like being quite the same version like Fedora 20  ;)##
 adrin	haha, I miss, fedora, right now my workstation is gentoo, anyway, my shogun is not git version, it's 3.0.0. I can switch to git though.
 besser82	adrin: switching to shogun git is not that much news actually; the biggest improvement from git-checkout is support for Protobuf-Strreaming....
 adrin	So I guess it wouldn't help my problem for now, but I can update it later if you submit some changes later.
 besser82	adrin: Sure!  I'll keep you updated  ;)

 adrin	besser82, thanks. You can reach me on ajalali@mpi-inf.mpg.de if I weren't here.
 besser82	adrin: Alles klaro!  Mache ich dann per E-Mail  ;)
 adrin	besser82: Alles klar, bis gleich ;)
 besser82	adrin: Jupp  ;)  Hast ne Mail!
@wiking	besser82: it's very unlikely... there's really a lot of stuff you need to fix manually (as 2to3 does not help) to be able to support python3
 besser82	wiking: which ones, beside some *.py-scripts?

 thoralf	Hey Iglesias, thanks.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, no problema!

@iglesiasg	thoralf, is that the error that appears when the data file is missing?
@iglesiasg	I restarted after merging but maybe there was some delay.. no idea
@iglesiasg	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/15248492#L4885
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Strange.  `git submodule update` does not show the new file.
 thoralf	data is still at its old revision.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, oh yeah
@iglesiasg	there needs to be done a commit with the new version IIRC
