 lambday	hello.. I am trying to implement a string kernel... how do I do some testing? I mean, I want to see what type of return values I get when I write get_feature_vector inside the "compute" function...
 lambday	I tried writing a small main function but getting some linking error
 lambday	-lshogun is needed?
 blackburn	lambday: sure

-!- ishan__ [~ishan@14.139.122.114] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 lambday	blackburn: thanks..but when I'm using the new kernel, I'm getting a ld error... while using other kernels doesn't give that error...
 blackburn	lambday: you probably forgot to implement some method then (just guess)
 lambday	blackburn: umm... the error is "temp.cpp:(.text+0x35): undefined reference to `shogun::CSSKStringKernel::CSSKStringKernel()"
 blackburn	lambday: no constructor implementation around then :)

-!- ishan [~ishan@14.139.122.114] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 lambday	blackburn: but I did :( I'm checking again
 blackburn	lambday: paste .cpp somewhere and I'll check
 lambday	blackburn: this is SSKStringKernel.h [http://pastebin.com/MiUdEFeY] and this is SSKStringKernel.cpp [http://pastebin.com/Rhb4rHxe]... I am using SNPStringKernel file to modify.. compute method is incomplete but it should work
 blackburn	lambday: I see nothing wrong so far
 lambday	to be sure, all I have to do is to add the .h and .cpp file in the kernel/string dir and run a make, right?
 lambday	i see the obj file is there in kernel/string
 blackburn	lambday: yes
 blackburn	lambday: they won't be available in modular interface if you don't add them to interfaces/modular/Kernel.i
 blackburn	and Kernel_includes.i in the same dir
 blackburn	but linking error is different
 lambday	oh...
 lambday	but I am just using this simple cpp file to test [http://pastebin.com/J2qxA9UL]

 lambday	when I use SNP it works, but for SSK its giving that undefined ref error

 blackburn	lambday: strange, I didn't notify anything wrong with that constructor
 lambday	blackburn: :(
 lambday	does it matter which interface it is configured to? since i am not using any interface
 blackburn	lambday: no
 lambday	okay then I am doing a make clean and then make
 blackburn	yes makes sense sometimes

 lambday	blackburn: didn't help... even strange - I added a method foobar to one of the existing kernels and tried to call it, it shows undefined reference again - but make was successful :-/
 lambday	may be I'm linking it wrong :-/
 blackburn	wiking: ping
 blackburn	lambday: no, -lshogun should be enough
 lambday	then may be i am linking it to an older libshogun.so
 lambday	I am checking

 wiking	blackburn: pong
 blackburn	wiking: wanted to ask you about clang static analyzer
 wiking	blackburn: listening
 blackburn	wiking: it generates no output for a reason
 blackburn	wiking: how did you use it?
 wiking	ah well u have output here
 wiking	http://categorizer.tmit.bme.hu/~wiking/shogun.sa/2013-03-09-2/
 wiking	but if u wanna use it locally
 wiking	basically it's done like this
 blackburn	wiking: I want output for tapkee :)
 blackburn	ah btw
 wiking	scan-build ./configure
 wiking	scan-build make
 blackburn	wiking: are you running mac now?
 wiking	ye
 blackburn	wiking: could you please test tapkee?
 wiking	mmm lemme checkout
 blackburn	wiking: git clone git://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee.git && cd tapkee && mkdir build && cmake -Dbuild_tests=1 .. && make && make test
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	wiking: git clone git://github.com/lisitsyn/tapkee.git && cd tapkee && mkdir build && cd build && cmake -Dbuild_tests=1 .. && make && make test
 wiking	-- Could NOT find OpenMP (missing:  OpenMP_C_FLAGS OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS)
 wiking	CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (include_directories): include_directories given empty-string as include directory.
 blackburn	here comes full thing for convenience :)
 wiking	the problem is clang does not have openmp
 blackburn	yeah I know
 blackburn	let me check
 blackburn	wiking: is that an error?
 wiking	yepp
 wiking	cmake dies with this
 blackburn	hmmm it is not rquired..
 wiking	well it still dies like that
 blackburn	wiking: it says can't found but continues here
 wiking	it tries all the different ways to find openmp
 blackburn	-- Could NOT find OpenMP (missing:  OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS)
 blackburn	-- Found minimal setup for the Google Mock library:
 blackburn	-- Configuring done
 blackburn	-- Generating done
 wiking	and then it does this

-!- hoijui [~hoijui@141.23.80.177] has joined #shogun

 blackburn	wiking: update ;)
 blackburn	just added it
 wiking	ok now it ran fine... building
 blackburn	wiking: good you pointed it out
 wiking	100%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/tapkee_tests.dir/test/simple.cpp.o
 wiking	Linking CXX executable tapkee_tests
 wiking	ld: library not found for -lgmock
 wiking	clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
 wiking	i think there's a missing -L there
 wiking	or something
 blackburn	I do not have much tests but just to check if it is working under mac
 blackburn	uhm
 wiking	r u building gtest/gmock statics ?
 wiking	as u'll have to do that
 blackburn	wiking: something is wrong with that gmock detection script
 blackburn	wiking: why? it works here as is
 wiking	that gmock i give him is purely the src
 wiking	there's no .so neither .a
 wiking	of gmock
 wiking	you should not expect having gmock/gtest shared
 wiking	as you should build them with the same compiler flags as your thing that u wanna test it with
 wiking	i.e. see shogun unit testing build
 blackburn	wiking: so I'd need to build gmock and then build tests with it?
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	u need to build gmock and gtest
 wiking	as static library
 wiking	and then link it to your testing executable
 blackburn	wiking: okay I see, requires some magic
 wiking	otherwise the main file builds
 blackburn	wiking: okay what about main thing
 blackburn	wiking: it builds?
 wiking	[master build] $ ./tapkee                                                                                                                          [wiking@welitron:~/tapkee/build]
 wiking	[error] No input file specified. Please use -h flag if stucked
 wiking	yes
 blackburn	wiking: okay, thanks! I'll try to add something to build gmock
 blackburn	wiking: not sure how to do that in cmake
 wiking	ithink there's something about this in the documents of gmock/gtest
 wiking	check their wiki
 blackburn	wiking: nothing
 wiking	:(
 blackburn	wiking: I am surprised with a variety of cmake finders
 blackburn	for gmock

@sonney2k	blackburn, if you see gsomix tell him thanks for the buffer proto fixes but also tell him that the director stuff does not work... at least when I run generator.py things are randomly crashing :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: he is around now I guess
@sonney2k	gsomix, ahh there you are
@sonney2k	didn't see you :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: but may be totally drunk
@sonney2k	blackburn, I know that he is Russian too
@sonney2k	so no news to me
 blackburn	sonney2k: actually he is a bad russian
 blackburn	sonney2k: he doesn't drink at all or so
@sonney2k	blackburn, drinking beer instead of vodka?
@sonney2k	ohh even worse
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah that's madness, I can't understand that
@sonney2k	no idea how you both can share a room
 blackburn	sonney2k: I usually at work and just get home to sleep (already drunk)
