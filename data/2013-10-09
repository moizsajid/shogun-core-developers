@sonney2k	HeikoS1, hey there
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: hi!
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, seen the gsoc announcement?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: yeah just read, awesome ;)
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: guess you have been a bit pessimistic about this
@sonney2k	yeah but I would also not want to admin - I mean totally not next year
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, would you take over?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I would maybe do it, but thats to decide later, I would rather mentor students than doing admin, but I guess it would be fair to take turns
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: just have so many gsoc project ideas I would like to mentor
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: and phd now is also running ...
 HeikoS1	in fact, I could be a student, haha ;D
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	but I know exactly what you mean
@sonney2k	I would rather want to mentor 100%
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I think we should discuss this sonner or later in the core team
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: but for now focus on other things
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, what is a bit unfortunate is that since wiking is no longer pushing
@sonney2k	the release is difficult to do
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: yeah well I guess its impossible to keep this up
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I know, release is hard, but that should be the focus for now
@sonney2k	it is too big now to do it alone
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: I even left out the link for the cloud stuff in mloss --- rather do release that messing with that currently
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, btw I thought deadline is Nov 4
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: no
@sonney2k	for mloss
 HeikoS1	today
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, in any case there is too much to do
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, maybe you could do the proper readme in markdown
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, I started but it is far from complete
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: yeah I wanted to do that next
@sonney2k	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
@sonney2k	see the README there?
 HeikoS1	in fact my plan is: Release Changelog in nice form and  Readme and feature list next
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, it links to install and other files at least
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: thats nice!
@sonney2k	mine is to get demos live
 HeikoS1	ok, two necessary things for release ;)
@iglesiasg	I can start doing some work with markdown for the readme if you want guys
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, do it!
 HeikoS1	yeah! :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, so the idea is first fix the things that are not correctly displayed, like the table
@iglesiasg	right?
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, and we have a serious serialization issue
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what is it?
@sonney2k	sth with strings is not working
 HeikoS1	since when?
@sonney2k	always
@sonney2k	I just did add an assertion for non-null
@sonney2k	and kaboom now we see it
 HeikoS1	dont we have tests for that?
@sonney2k	yeah they kaboom now and no we don't have detailled tests for that
 lisitsyn	hey mega HeikoS1
 HeikoS1	mega? :)
 lisitsyn	good job with the submission!
 lisitsyn	ja
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: where is an example?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: thanks! fingers crossed we get in
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, pretty certain
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1948/steps/test%20python%20modular/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, and I need help with the website - you opened some issues yourself so try fix some
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I tried to resolve mc ocas
 lisitsyn	no success yet argh
 lisitsyn	we have a demo tomorrow so will get back to it tomorrow
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: the example runs fine on my machine?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, sure
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, when did you last compile?
 HeikoS1	when did you put in the assert?
@sonney2k	yesterday morning
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: btw shouldnt the benchmarks being executed in the tests?
@sonney2k	so like 16 hours ago
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: ok let me fetch and compile
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, yeah maybe at some time
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: what assert is in there?
 HeikoS1	and where?
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: something is weird with the math typesetting in the GP notebook on the website
 HeikoS1	and for the mmd too
 HeikoS1	sonney2k: to fix those would be quite iportant due to workshop abstract is being read very soon, but I dont know whats wrong there

 shogun-notifier-	shogun:
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Nicer README
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: now the [1] etc should work too :)
 sonne|work	and we somehow need to link all the readmes together
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, for the references?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yes
 sonne|work	I am not sure how actually
 sonne|work	the .md suffix is a bit annoying
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, do you prefer .markdown? :)
@iglesiasg	that one is also valid hehe
 sonne|work	I mean INSTALL.md
 sonne|work	etc looks awful
 lisitsyn	why?
 lisitsyn	it looks ok for me I mean
@iglesiasg	I don't have anything against it either
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, we have probably looked at README and INSTALL files for less time so our brains are not so used to them without extensions :P
 lisitsyn	hah yes
 lisitsyn	that's about training models
@iglesiasg	hehehe indeed
 shogun-buildbot_	build #242 of osx1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx1%20-%20libshogun/builds/242  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: and it would be nice if this README.md would linkt to INSTALL etc for the stuff not so much inside the readme :)
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, so even further up before the quick links inside the file?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, there are two bullest basically on top of the document with links to INSTALL and README.data
 sonne|work	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/
@iglesiasg	we can move them further up maybe
@iglesiasg	ah all right, that one
@iglesiasg	sure
 sonne|work	well similar to this I would say :)
@iglesiasg	will do another iteration soon
@iglesiasg	the other md files need care as well
@iglesiasg	but in case if you don't mind applying small changes such as this one, do it in case I forget. I should work on another thing right now

 lambday	HeikoS: hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: things are insane at my side.. will update the notebook asap..
 lambday	HeikoS: I was just testing.. reducing the number of samples and increasing the ridge helps a *lot* in terms of runtime
 lambday	HeikoS: still didn't compile the whole thing.. but won't take long.. just some minor edits..
@HeikoS	hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: how are things with you?
@HeikoS	lambday: cool, let me know once you got it to a reasonable time :)

 lambday	HeikoS: ah, classy! :D
 lambday	HeikoS: wow! :D :D
@HeikoS	at least two guys told me they will check it out for their problem
@HeikoS	pretty big sparse matrices and in the need of log-dets
 lambday	HeikoS: btw I sorted out things with my supervisor ...
 lambday	HeikoS: as big as the apache2 matrix? :D
@HeikoS	currently solving with a big computer with +16gb ram, but thats hard to get so they like to have something else
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah :(
@HeikoS	lambday: ah good to hear, is he more relaxed now?
 lambday	HeikoS: we need preconditioners badly :(
 lambday	HeikoS: I will be all into it after December :(
@HeikoS	lambday: its really cool that the R things are working, maybe we should have an example for that in R at some point
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah dont worry
 lambday	HeikoS: yes seems so, as least he talked to me like a civil person last time
@HeikoS	I wont have any time before next year
@HeikoS	lambday: thats good, he should be glad that you  work for him!
 lambday	HeikoS: I am no idea about R :-/ but I will figure it out
