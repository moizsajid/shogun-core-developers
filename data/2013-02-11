 sumit	blackburn,hi!have been busy working on some course projects for the past few days,shall tell you more on scopes for deep learning, :) did you go through the code..?i had mailed it on your other email address ,
 sumit	i ll work on refining that code too!
 blackburn	sumit: hey, yes, glanced over it
 sumit	good :)
 blackburn	sumit: however if you want to integrate it you'd have to learn shogun structure and github development workflow
 sumit	you might not have found it upto the mark though :P ,, or simply futile,but i promise i shall work on them all ,,Yes exactly,that was a big drawback,,I should better get well versed woth shogun and github developments :) my apologies for that
 blackburn	well nothing to apologize - just try shogun at some point
 sumit	ohk perfectly fine :) I will do the needful :) thanks ...
 sumit	any news on gsoc 2013..?
 blackburn	no, I think we have nothing yet
 sumit	ok :) thanks , anyways I shall get back to you soon :)

@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko1 wiking_ - so it is official
@sonney2k	gsoc 2013 is there
 heiko1	yeah!
@sonney2k	https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013
@sonney2k	1month till application deadline
 heiko1	just read
 heiko1	I will write a description soon

 heiko1	sonney2k, already thoughts on projects?
@sonney2k	blackburn, so put the ideas page up then we can continue
@sonney2k	heiko1, sure
 heiko1	sonney2k, well the question was: which?
@sonney2k	1 cleanup project for supporting i/o for all the different features in all standard formats as usual :D
@sonney2k	1 project doing examples in $LANG + graphically / interactive via website w/ d3js
 heiko1	awesome!
 heiko1	like that
@sonney2k	1 project to get rid of the static interfaces mostly and merge them in elwms and move the elwms features to python modular too (being able to run R scripts from python_modular etc)
 heiko1	btw sonney2k, you once sent me a link where some presentation was made with d3js and something else and all was moving, which one was that?
@sonney2k	1 project optimization stuff with vojtech maybe
 heiko1	like that too, we need R support
@sonney2k	1 project hashing features with olivier
 heiko1	oh, I could need a krylov method iterative linear solver for mine, maybe this could be combined somehow
@sonney2k	1 project fast kernel approximations with smola's gang ;)
 heiko1	that also sounds cool
@sonney2k	heiko1, I cannot admin this year though but 1 student should be OK
@sonney2k	heiko1, yeah that was d3js
 heiko1	but I remember it moving around, when I google d3js nothing moves
@sonney2k	heiko1, it does
@sonney2k	crazily actually
 heiko1	so where to find thos
@sonney2k	d3js
 heiko1	ah, I guesss last time my browser wasnt working
 heiko1	awesome!
 heiko1	ah not all of the examples move
@sonney2k	heiko1, it is a matter of 1 line of js to make things morph in d3
@sonney2k	but it would be very cool to have such stuff on the website
 heiko1	indeed
 heiko1	especially with interactive examples :)
 heiko1	gp heatmaps and stuff like that :)
@sonney2k	the only thing that worries me is that we are late organizing this year
@sonney2k	it is all very doable still but we need a release this year before gsoc at all cost
@sonney2k	that is within 1 month or we will screw up badly with tons of new changes coming in again
@sonney2k	heiko1, btw I didn't like your answer on the mailinglist
 heiko1	sonney2k, which one?
@sonney2k	I am very much in favor of removing C1/C2
@sonney2k	it is totally useless in practice
 heiko1	sonney2k, well still doesnt hurt you
@sonney2k	the most general solution would be to use SGMatrix<flaot64_t> C
 heiko1	my point was more that its not high-priority (we talked about this 2 years ago)
 heiko1	sonney2k, agreed
@sonney2k	heiko1, it hurts - takes way to long to do MS
@sonney2k	heiko1, but consider how many people are asking about this
@sonney2k	so yes it is needed
 heiko1	sonney2k, true
@sonney2k	much more than C1/C2
@sonney2k	question is if we would do SGMatrix C
@sonney2k	can we do MS then?
 heiko1	so sgmatrix C has a C for every *what*?
@sonney2k	or would we have to use some hack say - float C : if C == 0 -> c_matrix is used?
@sonney2k	heiko1, no c_matrix is like:
@sonney2k	1) 1 element == usual C
@sonney2k	2) 2 elements == like C1 / C2
@sonney2k	3) a (2,n) matrix -> a C for each element
 heiko1	ah, I see
@sonney2k	heiko1, but can we do MS with SGMatrices?
 heiko1	thinking ...
 heiko1	I mean, in principal, yes
 heiko1	but this having multiple possibilities is a bit more difficult I guess
 heiko1	but wait
 heiko1	no it should be no problem
 heiko1	since the SVM handles to case distinctions for the C-matrix having different structure right?
@sonney2k	heiko1, I am talking about the standard case mostly - would grid search work for a single element?
 heiko1	I think yes, it might need a bit of  tuning (since not done yet)
 heiko1	but it is possible
@sonney2k	(like everything :)
 heiko1	I mean the model selection just iterates through the parameter tree combinations and sets their elements to the registered parameters
 heiko1	and this works for matrices
 heiko1	the parameter trees can also contain matrices
 heiko1	the only thing is that we do not have a set-range for matrices
 heiko1	but these can be set by hand for now
 heiko1	quite some time ago, I cannot perfectly remember how this works :)
 heiko1	sonney2k, I will go home now, still in the office and its definitely time for Feierabend! :)
 heiko1	see you later
@sonney2k	cu
 heiko1	btw I will have a look at the stuff soon and come up with a more precise "how difficult is that" answer
 heiko1	I also recently started coding a bit again, so will try to fix/finish things for release, and I just stopped adding features to my stuff, so only testing etc,
 heiko1	bye

 blackburn	alright sonney2k
 blackburn	sonney2k: will make a draft of ideas page
 blackburn	tomorrow
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok - just copy the page from last year
 blackburn	sonney2k: I wanted to fill in some ideas
@sonney2k	sure feel free to clean up the old page
 blackburn	sonney2k: so you want 1) cleanup, i/o 2) examples 3) static stuff 4) vojtech 5) olivier 6) fast kernel
 blackburn	if we get igor 7) some compressive sensing
 blackburn	then 8) heiko's krylov (??, I am not sure it is a summer-long project)
 blackburn	and 9) I'd like to have someone on dimension reduction
 blackburn	I am not that happy with 2) and 3) - it is way too difficult for me to define such projects
 blackburn	in general this could be done meanwhile by most active students and mentors like you and me
 blackburn	so lets negotiate that later
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd appreciate if you give me some information (just brief) who should I contact with (olivier, ...)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I will ask them
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would mentor 2) or 3) - but I guess 3 only if your roommate does it :D
@sonney2k	it is tough stuff
@sonney2k	but 2) is really what we need for promotion one needs python, d3js, django, a little ML and artistics skills to do this tough ...
@sonney2k	though
