 ptizoom	Hi, I have a few Q... is there a "task" force for swigging shogun and perl-module?

 ptizoom	also is there a modularity with shogun (like in pybrain)?
 ptizoom	I am looking also for IO interface with relationnal DB ?
 wiking	ptizoom: which db would u like to use?
 wiking	ptizoom: as far as i understand from you question there's a similar modularity with shogun like in pybrain (see modular_python interface of shogun)... but if you meant something else then please specify
 ptizoom	DB: hi, I am using db through SQL ! nothing fancy!
 wiking	ptizoom: yeah but which particular db?
 ptizoom	DB: I am using Class::DBI from perl, and relations has_many, ... to any of SQLite3, Postgres, MySQL.
 wiking	ah yeah
 wiking	well afaik it's possible to make a new IO class
 wiking	only thing is that we'd need to choose a good library that does all the wrapping for the most common DBs
 wiking	but then again u can do that by your own... i mean to write the whole datafetching in python put the output into a numpy array and use that in shogun

 ptizoom	db:one shall think of accessing data with a gradiant of efficiency: mmap,io-sockets-ibus-handlers to many block devices,  cluserised-netted-devices
 wiking	?
 ptizoom	no worries!
 wiking	it's up to you how you gather your data
 wiking	the only time i think you'll need the special IO class for DB
 ptizoom	ok, it is a good deal!
 wiking	if u want to use streamingfeatures
 ptizoom	ah... IO classes for DB!
 ptizoom	and why so?
 ptizoom	IO classes for db are a nightmare.....
 wiking	i'm just saying that for straeamingfeatures you'd need your own implementation of how to fetch data from the DB one-by-one
 sonne|work	ptizoom: no one attempted that for perl - but given swig is working stably it should not be too hard ... basically writing typemaps for perl arrays etc
 wiking	but it's not rocketscience at all to write an sql query for that ...
 ptizoom	well wiking, there is more than sql queries.... db can be quite sofisticated, one need to manage db access, tables, and raw, then those are relationel... etc...
 wiking	ptizoom: ? we're just talking about accessing features from db
 ptizoom	the perl-dbx/dbi classes are quite extricated and have been evolving since the begining of it!
 ptizoom	db are the most sophisticated ways of storing data (and indeed accessing features)... I think these are important to grow machine learning
 ptizoom	I just wanted to check with you where you put the bundaries of IO?
 ptizoom	my problem is, parsing one data format to a "shogun" format... really.
 ptizoom	ok, for perl, I would like to give a go to swig it...see you in a few month!
