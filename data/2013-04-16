@lisitsyn	HeikoS: btw it is my bad I merged that stuff sorry
@lisitsyn	never trust people hah
 HeikoS	lisitsyn:  no worries
 HeikoS	I mean he said he has run the tests
@lisitsyn	yes
 HeikoS	maybe unit tests only (they seem to work)
 HeikoS	we should have a howto on that
 HeikoS	is he replying to fix?
@lisitsyn	not yet replied
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: say, about this eigen3 sparse matrix class
 HeikoS	how do I make a class invisible for swig?
 HeikoS	just not put an interface?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes if it is not included it won't be used by swig
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: okay
 HeikoS	where is a good place to put the eigen3 helper class?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: actually mathematics/eigen3.h may be a good place
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: okay!
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I hope we don't include it in headers
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: what do you mean?
 HeikoS	include eigen3=?
@lisitsyn	include <shogun/mathematics/eigen3.h> should happen only in .cpp
 HeikoS	why should we? class members should be G
 HeikoS	SG type
 HeikoS	s
 HeikoS	hah typing is sometimes not so easy
@lisitsyn	what are you using? :)
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: LOL
 HeikoS	hahahha
 HeikoS	there is another guy for the gaussian project
 HeikoS	who has the same name
 HeikoS	as the first one :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: no way
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: really?
 HeikoS	yes, so first name
@lisitsyn	wait - just the same?
 HeikoS	yes
 HeikoS	funny isn't it?
@lisitsyn	Soumyajit De
@lisitsyn	that guy?
 HeikoS	yes
@lisitsyn	and there is an another one?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: he is acutally called Rahul
 HeikoS	and the other one also is
 HeikoS	at least thats how they sigh their mails
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I've lost a track what is happening :D

 HeikoS	erlenda: ha!
 HeikoS	hi
 erlenda	hi
 HeikoS	any particular reason why you are here? :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I asked all mentors to hang here
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: I see
 HeikoS	ok
 HeikoS	was just wondering whether there are any questions
 erlenda	yeah, so I just started hanging
 HeikoS	erlenda: nice :)
@lisitsyn	erlenda: HeikoS: how do you guys planning to mentor it?
@lisitsyn	three mentors!
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: I had the following in mind: me: helping out with shogun stuff, erlend: helping out with C++-implentation questions/design, dan: helping out with general big picture of what to use/not use
@lisitsyn	I see
 HeikoS	we probably will skype about it soon
 HeikoS	to get a better plan
@lisitsyn	erlenda: so you have some background in C++?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: he wrote the KRYLSTAT that we want to copy :)
@lisitsyn	I see
 erlenda	Written some C++. Some experience in templating and stuff
 erlenda	But I am no guru
@lisitsyn	nice to know
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: you are the guru :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: of C++?
 HeikoS	yes, and + other things
@lisitsyn	well, I know some tricks but I know nothing about machine learning though :)
 HeikoS	erlenda: I will propose a google hangout with daniel soon where we can discuss a few things, also would be nice just to say hello face to face. Next week or so
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: so I always can ask you thats enough :)
 erlenda	@HeikoS: Sounds good
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: nothing??! maybe you don't have a Ph.D. in ML but I think you know way more than nothing ;)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: comparing to say HeikoS? :)
@iglesiasg	not good to compare, we are talking about absolute knowledge :)
@lisitsyn	I do not do any research - that's my disaster :)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: did I told you I got that dummy callbacks thing to work?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: yes
@lisitsyn	I got pretty tired after that and powered off :D
@iglesiasg	hehe understandable
@lisitsyn	will commit that stuff today
@iglesiasg	nice, I will see it then
@lisitsyn	have to cover it with a few tests
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ah btw we wanted to discuss a new dimension reduction algorithm based on MMD :)
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: yes, we should do that at some point :)
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: once I finish this one project here, I will have way more time
 HeikoS	and its almost done
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ok just let me know
 HeikoS	will do!

@lisitsyn	 iglesiasg it should :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: no idea why the class is not compiled
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: swig?
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: no it needs to be in lib/config.h
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: no, it is my PrimalMosekSOSVM that is guarded with USE_MOSEK
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: the USE_MOSEK needs to be in lib/config.h?
@iglesiasg	I have built it several times without modifying lib/config.h
@iglesiasg	it is true it is not the first time I find this problem though
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: lib/config.h is autogenerated
 sonne|work	but defines need to be in there
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: how is it possible that it worked other times then?
@iglesiasg	I have never put it in there
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: didn't we change configure all the time for that?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: I don't understand, the configure script? when all the time?

@iglesiasg	line 81: X = embedding.get_feature_matrix()
@iglesiasg	X is now a numpy array and you can do with it plotting stuff

 HeikoS	lambday: hi!
 HeikoS	just answered your mail
 lambday	HeikoS: checking...
 lambday	HeikoS: umm... only from cpp for avoiding including it everywhere even when not needed..
 HeikoS	lambday: yes and to save trouble with swig
 HeikoS	if you include it in some class that has swig interfaces, it might cause problems
 HeikoS	so just use in cpp
 HeikoS	but that was just a minor comment
 HeikoS	lambday: good stuff, we will need this often so very useful

@iglesiasg	still, weird thing that I didn't need to do that any time before. Did something related to lib/config.h change recently?

 diwmaron	Hello
@lisitsyn	diwmaron: hey
 diwmaron	I'm interested about topic of Google Summer of code
 lambday	HeikoS: the custom EigenTriplet definition shouldn't also be in the header? Its already there in the newer eigen, we just need it for older eigen. would it cause trouble too?
 diwmaron	Implement metric learning algorithms with applications to metagenomics
@lisitsyn	lambday: I'd put it to eigen3.h
 diwmaron	I'm not sure if I understood problem correctly
 HeikoS	lambday: yeah, agree with Sergey
@lisitsyn	diwmaron: which problem?
@lisitsyn	LMNN?
 diwmaron	Is there anyone who could give me some more details?
 diwmaron	yeap
 lambday	HeikoS, lisitsyn: okay..
@iglesiasg	diwmaron: someone else asked a few hours ago in the mailing list about this project
@lisitsyn	diwmaron: there is a mentor for that idea - he is not around right now but I'd recommend send him an email
@iglesiasg	diwmaron: and the mentor answered to that mail
@iglesiasg	diwmaron: you may find that info interesting
 diwmaron	great
 diwmaron	Thanks a lot!
 diwmaron	see you in the future
@iglesiasg	diwmaron: do you know how to read the mailing list or should I point you to it?
 diwmaron	There is no need. I have basic knowlege of mailing lists  :) Thanks!

 sonne|work	iglesiasg: totally remove the branches
@iglesiasg	yeah
@iglesiasg	yaay I am back to black screwing up pull requests
 wiking	mmm
@iglesiasg	aaah shit I think I know what I did wrong
 wiking	iglesiasg: what would be really good as well to do different batches on travis.
 wiking	iglesiasg: with that we could test as well the different interfaces on travis
@iglesiasg	wiking: aham!
@iglesiasg	it sounds interesting
 wiking	iglesiasg: i've had this planned out but never managed to go around it and change the yml file
 wiking	iglesiasg: but this can be definitely done by using batches or what...
 wiking	iglesiasg: with env variable we can do this
 wiking	iglesiasg: so by defining an env variables like INTERFACES
 wiking	iglesiasg: and then basically create a matrix that has the various interfaces and then the configure should be something like ./configure --interfaces=$INTERFACES
 wiking	the only thing should be still fixed is that the right packages are installed for the given interface
@iglesiasg	wiking: that could get messy, or?
 wiking	the reasone why we need to do a one interface per env variable is because otherwise you run out of hard limit for building time
 wiking	iglesiasg: why?
@iglesiasg	to get all the dependencies
@iglesiasg	right
 wiking	iglesiasg: well as we know what are the dependencies for the given inteface
 wiking	we just set a new env variable for the extra packages we need for the given interface
 wiking	let say you have a EXTRA_PACKAGES env variable
 wiking	and that is set
 wiking	as well with the INTERFACE variable
 wiking	iglesiasg: and then in the before_install part you append only that variable $EXTRA_PACKAGES
 wiking	to the apt-get install
 wiking	it can be empty
 wiking	i mean $EXTRA_PACKAGES
 wiking	if it only build the core part
@lisitsyn	wiking: oh long time no see!
@lisitsyn	:)
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah back
 wiking	lisitsyn: conference is over
@lisitsyn	wiking: what conference?
 wiking	isbi 2013
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	and how it was?
 wiking	it was great
 wiking	and san francisco is cool as well
 wiking	the city itself
 wiking	i've promoted there shogun
@lisitsyn	oh that's nice
 wiking	2 guys heard and constantly use it ;)
 wiking	and another 5 guys were really interested in it
 wiking	the 2 guys who use it really appreciate it
 wiking	and they really like it... at least they told me so
@iglesiasg	wiking: what were they using it for?
@iglesiasg	or are
@lisitsyn	wiking: so you didn't make them suffer to say that?
 wiking	:)
@lisitsyn	no torments?
 wiking	mostly they are using the svm part of it
 wiking	i told them there is much more to it as well... as well as there's gonna be some really good stuff coming this summer with GSoC13
 wiking	iglesiasg: so what do you say about this ?
@iglesiasg	wiking: about the travis thing?
 wiking	iglesiasg: yes
 wiking	i mean what we really need only
 wiking	is for a given interface what other packages we need
 wiking	apart from the basic ones
@iglesiasg	I don't understand it completely clear TBH
 wiking	ok
 wiking	so now we build only libshogun interface
 wiking	on travis
 wiking	right?
@iglesiasg	ok, I didn't know it was just libshogun actually :)
 wiking	what we could do is that we also build perl_modular, python_modular, r_modular, octave_modular, java_modular, csharp_modular, lua_modular, ruby_modular
 wiking	the only problem is
 wiking	that travis has a hard limit on compilation time
 wiking	so if we build all the modular interfaces at once
 wiking	we'll run out of that hard limit
 wiking	so what we shoudl do is divide up this task
@iglesiasg	ok
 wiking	i.e. each interface should be build separately
 HeikoS	wiking, it would be cool to have the python working
 HeikoS	this is the most interesting for travis
 wiking	so this can be done by using enviromental variables on travis
 wiking	because travis automatically will try to run a separate build process for each different values of a given env variable
 wiking	so what i suggest is to have 2 env variables
 wiking	http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Set-environment-variables
 wiking	iglesiasg: see the example what they say there for ruby and FOO and BAR
 wiking	so 1 env variable is INTERFACES
 wiking	which always have only one value
 wiking	e.g. INTERFACES=python_modular
@lisitsyn	yes makes sense
 wiking	and you have a corresponding env variable
 wiking	EXTRA_PACKAGES=
 wiking	ok
 wiking	can i now
 wiking	directly commit to develop
@lisitsyn	wiking: yes sure
 wiking	with git-flow method?
 wiking	ok let's see how this works :)))
@lisitsyn	wiking: I don't mind even w/o git-flow for small commits (not sure what others think)
@iglesiasg	wiking: and how is it done to control when one of the builds ends (say python_modular) another starts (libshogun or whatever)
 wiking	iglesiasg: travis will take care of automatically
 wiking	can anybody tell me what is the dependency for python_modular
 wiking	i mean packages on
 wiking	debian
@iglesiasg	anything else I can think of apart from python, numpy, swig
@iglesiasg	nothing* hehe
@lisitsyn	wiking: python-numpy-dev
@lisitsyn	swig
@lisitsyn	swig2.0 IIRC
@lisitsyn	http://cs7004.vk.me/c7006/v7006806/2d1c/49_aQ8y5UNg.jpg
@iglesiasg	haha oldie one
 wiking	EXTRA_PACKAGES="python-numpy-dev, swig2.0"
 wiking	anything else?
@lisitsyn	wiking: sorry not under ubuntu right now
@lisitsyn	wiking: python-dev maybe
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: how to tell the buildbot to rebuild the python modular?
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot:
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot force
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot force restart something
@lisitsyn	:D
 HeikoS	shogun-buildbot: force restart deb3
 shogun-buildbot	try 'force build [--branch=BRANCH] [--revision=REVISION] [--props=PROP1=VAL1,PROP2=VAL2...]  <WHICH> <REASON>'
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot:  force build 'deb3 - modular_interfaces'
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot:  force build 'deb3 - modular_interfaces' 'please'
 HeikoS	did it work?
@lisitsyn	no idea :D
 HeikoS	pleeeease :)
@lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot, force build 'deb3 - modular_interfaces' 'please'
 shogun-buildbot	build forced [ETA 44m36s]
 shogun-buildbot	I'll give a shout when the build finishes
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: ha triggered
 HeikoS	haha
 HeikoS	 :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: do you know there is a programming language
 HeikoS	the please did it!
@lisitsyn	where you have to put please
@lisitsyn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL

@iglesiasg	wiking: re
 wiking	so
 wiking	somebody should merge the current .travis.yml in develop to master branch
 wiking	ok waith
 wiking	not yet
 wiking	iglesiasg: so should we always try to build master as well?
 wiking	or only develop?
 wiking	i would go with master and develop
@iglesiasg	wiking: AFAIK travis is going to build only when we push stuff
 wiking	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	so if we don't have much activity in master for a long while
 wiking	nonono
@iglesiasg	as it should be with this git-flow model
@iglesiasg	then it is not going to keep on building the same
 wiking	now it builds only master
@iglesiasg	then I think it makes sense to build master too
 wiking	as we set it up like that
 wiking	but
@iglesiasg	I issued a pull request so that all branches were built
 wiking	i think it's not smart enough
@iglesiasg	sonne|work wanted to have it like that
 lambday	HeikoS: fixed...
 wiking	to know that which branch is pushed
 lambday	sending the PR :)
 HeikoS	lambday: nice :)
 wiking	iglesiasg: if travis is being notified that there was a push
 wiking	then it'll try to build all the branches that are mentioned
 wiking	not only the ones where there's a change
 wiking	Travis will always look for the .travis.yml file that is contained in the branch specified by the git commit that GitHub has passed to us. This configuration in one branch will not affect the build of another, separate branch. Also, Travis CI will build after any git push to your GitHub project unless you instruct it to skip a build. You can limit this behavior with configuration options.
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	maybe it is actually smart enough ;)
 wiking	or not
 wiking	i dont really get this explanation
 lambday	HeikoS: one more thing, if I add a new file.. all I need to do is run configure again and then make, right?
 wiking	from the last 2 sentence i think it'll build all the branches
 wiking	regardless of which branch was modified
 wiking	but from the first part of this i understood that it'll do the work only on the modified branch
 HeikoS	lambday: what file and where?

 HeikoS	Heiko: Develop
@iglesiasg	wiking: it sounds to me like if you push to one branch, then it is going to build for all the branches as specified in the travis.yml of the branch you have pushed to
@iglesiasg	does that make sense?
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	so basically you understand
 wiking	that it'll build
 wiking	on the branch where there was modification
 wiking	and only if it's enabled
 wiking	right?
@iglesiasg	not really

 lambday	HeikoS: eigen3.cpp in shogun/mathematics/.. where SGSparseMatrix to SparseMatrix is to be defined..
 wiking	iglesiasg: then? :)
 HeikoS	lambday: then yes, just add the file, linking should work automatically
@iglesiasg	wiking: let's make some syntax analysis :D
@iglesiasg	Travis will always look for the .travis.yml file that is contained in the branch specified by the git commit that GitHub has passed to us
@iglesiasg	1) What is the commit that GitHub passes to them?
 wiking	that's done by a hook
 wiking	github commit hook
 shogun-buildbot	build #1012 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1012
@iglesiasg	no idea how the hook works
 wiking	anyhow
 wiking	i think it is executed
 wiking	as a post commit hook
 wiking	so when github receives a new commit
 wiking	it executes the hook of travis
 lambday	HeikoS: okay.. :)
 wiking	and it passes there the branch where the commit happened
 wiking	so if it receives a new commit to develop
 wiking	it'll send to travis
 wiking	the branch name
 wiking	and the commit sha1
 wiking	^ branch name = develop
 wiking	and then travis will check whether that branch has a .travis.yml
@iglesiasg	wiking: but that sounds a bit like if it'd do it commit by commit
@iglesiasg	and probably it is not
@iglesiasg	wiking: what did you mean with post commit hook?
@iglesiasg	mm you explained afterwards, nvm
 wiking	Also, Travis CI will build after any git push to your GitHub project unless you instruct it to skip a build.
 wiking	this should mean for me
 wiking	i mean this means for me
 wiking	that it'll run
 wiking	CI
 wiking	after any git push
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	and that makes lot of sense
 wiking	unless it's specified otherwise
 wiking	now the question is
@iglesiasg	however, I get lost in there with this "commit that GitHub passes us"
 wiking	iglesiasg: github will pass to Travis
 wiking	in what branch happend the change
 wiking	and the commit sha-1 string
 wiking	so that travis can do the building of that given commit
 wiking	and yes
 wiking	travis runs after each commit
@iglesiasg	oh
@iglesiasg	so say you do a push with 20 new commits
@iglesiasg	it is going to build 20 times?
 wiking	indeed
 wiking	or i hope so :)
 wiking	otherwise i dont understand a fucking thing
 wiking	:)
@iglesiasg	ok, there must be a reason to do it like that :)
 wiking	although
 wiking	let me check something
 wiking	ok
 wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/901
@iglesiasg	wiking: then, I think we don't need to push to master in order to get travis to work in develop
 wiking	i might be wrong
 wiking	iglesiasg: there's only one build for that PR
 wiking	not 4
 wiking	so maybe it's push per push
 wiking	ok let's try it
 wiking	;)
@iglesiasg	wiking: is travis utterly slow in your browser too?
@iglesiasg	I have cliked in pull requests tab one month ago :D
@iglesiasg	clicked*
 wiking	iglesiasg: yes
 wiking	it's fucking slow
 wiking	ok i'll just do a direct commit now the develop branch
 wiking	add develop branch into .travis.yml
 wiking	even better
 wiking	i do your PR :D
@iglesiasg	wiking: yeah
@iglesiasg	I was going to tell you that :)
 wiking	and then we will invalidate your PR ;)

@iglesiasg	hey cameron_
 cameron_	i am trying to start in shogun
 cameron_	and are having troubles in compiling the files
 cameron_	planning to use C++ with g++
@iglesiasg	ok
 cameron_	got the basic example working. (the minimal one)
@iglesiasg	good
 cameron_	and i downloaded the package just straight from synaptic package manager
 cameron_	didn't bother to do make and install
@iglesiasg	cameron_: ok
 cameron_	then was trying to run the gaussian filter example in the tutorial
 cameron_	and it doesn't work
 cameron_	a bunch of undefined reference popped up
 cameron_	i think i just need to link back to the library
@iglesiasg	cameron_: mmm it might be that the tutorial is not sync with the version of shogun you are using
 HeikoS	cameron_: yes, -lshogun
 deerishi	in KernelPCA in python modular, get_transformation_matrix() converts the shogun feature data matrix to the numpy matrix ,rite?(note i am doing get_transformation_matrix() after kernelpca has been done)
 HeikoS	deerishi: what exactly do you  mean?
 cameron_	yes, i already used -lshogun
 cameron_	still it doesn't work
 deerishi	i want to see the plotted data after kernel pca has been done
 deerishi	i want to confirm if the data has been made linearly separable
 HeikoS	deerishi: thats good, what is the question then?
 HeikoS	shogun matrices are directly translated into numpy
 deerishi	HeikoS : after doing "preprocessor.apply_to_feature_matrix(features) ",in order to see the results, i need to transform features to a numpy array,by doing get_transformation_matrix().but the thing is the matrix i am getting back is of greater dimension. eg if the data was a array of size 2x302 ,the matrix i am getting back is of size 302x302.how do i plot that to confirm if kernel pca has worked or not?

 deerishi_	HeikoS:the data is 2 semicircular arcs of radius 50 and 100 respectively
 HeikoS	deerishi_: ok now
 HeikoS	deerishi_: so the transformation matrix are the eigenvectors
 HeikoS	of the kernel matrix
@iglesiasg	see you later people
-!- iglesiasg [~nando@n132-p169.kthopen.kth.se] has quit [Quit: leaving]
 HeikoS	but you want to plot the projection
 HeikoS	say on top of the first two eigenvectors
 deerishi_	top 2 in the sense, say the first and second row, or according to the eigenvalues
 HeikoS	no, the transformation matrix are just the eigenvalues
 HeikoS	if you want to see the projection on the first two you have to multiply the first two
 HeikoS	but the KernelPCA class does this for you
 HeikoS	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/2.0.1/KernelPCA_8cpp_source.html#l00128
 HeikoS	this method returns the new feature matrix with the projection
 HeikoS	float64_t* new_feature_matrix = SG_MALLOC(float64_t, m_target_dim*num_vectors);
 HeikoS	so you have to set the target dimension
 HeikoS	and then call this method
 HeikoS	then your features have another dimension
 HeikoS	deerishi_:  gotta go now, hope that helped, if not, ask on the mailing list, I might have a look tonight

@sonney2k	hashing/demo etc
@lisitsyn	ahh
@sonney2k	I missed foulwall today - did you see him?
@sonney2k	and I've seen another cool demo
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: no
@sonney2k	https://github.com/dvalcarce/shogun-gsoc
@sonney2k	check this out ^
@sonney2k	git clone
@sonney2k	and then just make
@sonney2k	(you need shogun python modular installed)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I am indeed thinking about extending the idea
@sonney2k	I mean with real shogun webservice style stuff
@sonney2k	and tutorial style intro
@sonney2k	and maybe splitting it up
@sonney2k	as that is way to big
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes that's a trouble
@sonney2k	about hashing we might also have some nice candidates
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you recall how it was in last years
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what exactly?
@sonney2k	I mean when we slowly became sure who would be ideal for which slot?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh last time we had no doubts
@sonney2k	err
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but now dates are shifted
@sonney2k	not from the very beginning
@lisitsyn	so I am confused
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what I am sure - *after* submissions of proposals
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	well it is still 2 weeks to get to know candidates
@sonney2k	so maybe it will become more clear
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: 2?
@sonney2k	btw I don't remember that it was that long last time
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: everything was much shorter
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I guess everyone is confused with that schedule
@sonney2k	yes may 3rd
@sonney2k	is the deadline
@lisitsyn	yes
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	will try to remember
@sonney2k	it is 1 month of getting to know people
@sonney2k	very long
@sonney2k	on the other hand they get to know us too :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, did you try the demo?

@lisitsyn	sonney2k: that demo
@sonney2k	nice uh?
@lisitsyn	yes quite nice
@sonney2k	I kind of dreamt of doing this
@lisitsyn	so you will be in trouble
@sonney2k	we will see
@lisitsyn	you are already in trouble with too many candidates :)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: worst thing is that they have zero conversion
@lisitsyn	like a guy that wants to do hashing can do libqp instead
@lisitsyn	but demo people are not that interested in our dirty ml related deals
