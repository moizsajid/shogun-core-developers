@wiking	OXPHOS, ping
@wiking	:)
 OXPHOS	wiking: hey
@wiking	OXPHOS,  https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/linalg_refactor/src/shogun/lib/SGMatrix.h#L39-L40
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/linalg_refactor/src/shogun/lib/SGVector.h#L44-L48
@wiking	these are explicitly moved to public
@wiking	in develop
 OXPHOS	wiking: ohhhh i see. sure please move them out. I think the friend class can also be removed
@wiking	and the other patch i needed to fix
@wiking	that in euclideandistance the precompute becomes like this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/distance/EuclideanDistance.cpp#L83-L94
@wiking	i.e. no linalg::dot involved
@wiking	anyhow thye are really minor changes
@wiking	so if you dont mind
@wiking	i'll do now a forcepush to the branch
@wiking	that way the branch gets rebased on develop
 OXPHOS	wiking: sure please go ahead!
@wiking	ok?
@wiking	ok pushing!
@wiking	done

@wiking	OXPHOS, ok so just a quick follow up on the issue
@wiking	with the rotational matrix
@wiking	OXPHOS, we could change a bit the function declaration of that api
@wiking	say
@wiking	void rotational_matrix(int32_t size, SGMatrix<T>& matrix);
@wiking	?
@wiking	that way we wouldnt have any problem to infer things
@wiking	or?

 OXPHOS	wiking: yes with SGMatrix<T> in param it can infer
 OXPHOS	sanuj hey sry cannot do pm for some reason..
 sanuj	okay
 sanuj	OXPHOS, did you submit your work on gsoc website?
 OXPHOS	sanuj: not yet..close
 sanuj	i'm submitting it like this
 sanuj	https://gist.github.com/sanuj/62f576cdaa80ecaa781f78b4b9298de4
 sanuj	do you think it's fine?
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 OXPHOS	sanuj: I don't know the rules - but I think as long as you have enough PRs it should be fine?
 sanuj	yeah
 OXPHOS	sanuj: I checked some report people shared on facebook and they're kinda elabroated.
 OXPHOS	sanuj: I have one last part left..but it's more or less like this: https://github.com/OXPHOS/shogun/wiki/GSoC-2016-Final-Report---The-Shogun-Detox
 sanuj	oh wow
 sanuj	i should improve mine :D
@wiking	i wouldn't sweat it so much
@wiking	although i dont know how it is now
@wiking	back in my time this wasn't so strict of the code submission
 sanuj	wiking, ohkay
@wiking	i mean i would say both are fine
@wiking	sanuj: yours is very clean and simple
@wiking	OXPHOS: did an essay :)
 OXPHOS	wiking: :D like README
@wiking	:P
 sanuj	oh, i guess i'll just submit
 sanuj	i can edit the gist later too
 sanuj	if required
@wiking	indeed
 OXPHOS	u r right
 sanuj	OXPHOS, are you back in the US?
@wiking	oh man merging all these feature branches is going to be fun :)
 OXPHOS	sanuj: yes..but in california now. will go back to east coast by the end of this week
 sanuj	OXPHOS, remember i got an intern at JHU
 OXPHOS	sanuj: yes!
 sanuj	those people are taking a lot of time with the paperwork required for me to apply for visa
 sanuj	it has been almost a month
 OXPHOS	wiking: I need to revise some stuff based on the tag/plugin change
@wiking	that's alright
 OXPHOS	sanuj: you're running out of time?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, they told me the delay is due to some US Federal Employment laws that are set to go into place on December 1, 2016
 sanuj	i suspect the law is this: https://www.employmentlawwatch.com/2016/05/articles/employment-us/u-s-dol-releases-final-revisions-on-overtime-protections/
 sanuj	OXPHOS, you think they might have second thoughts and cancel the internship invitation as they won't be able to fund me with the new law in place?
 sanuj	because in that case i should start looking for new research internships
 OXPHOS	sanuj: sorry I had no clue about it..they shouldn't, but who knows..I have a friend who got kicked out of graduate school after 1st year because his P.I. "suddenly run out of money" after taking him
 OXPHOS	sanuj: so I'll suggest you start looking for new internships..as it's gonna take a while anyway
 OXPHOS	do they mean they'll start signing the paperwork after Dec 1st...?
 sanuj	i don't think so
 sanuj	OXPHOS, the mail said: they need confirmation from the prof about my appointment, after the knowledge of this new law.
 OXPHOS	sanuj: oh so I guess you can harass the prof for the confirmation letter and see what he thinks?
 sanuj	OXPHOS, seems like the prof is very busy, people working in the lab did my interview and everything else
 sanuj	i don't like applying for research interns, most of the profs don't even read my mails :)
 OXPHOS	sanuj: i got no reply from industry either...I guess it's because of my major but I was applying for bioinfo
 OXPHOS	sanuj: but you have to e-mail the prof since he decides to take you
 OXPHOS	sanuj: my experience is they'll blame you if you missed something because you're too "polite" or patient with them XD
 sanuj	:P
 sanuj	okay i'll send a mail today
 OXPHOS	good luck!
 sanuj	OXPHOS, thanks! :D

 Saurabh7	Benni_: use get_subkernel_weights() maybe
 Benni_	Im using the VB-inference + gradient based model selection framework (similar to the last chapter in the VB-notebook). However, the subkernel weights are all 1.0 before and after model selection (Im using 3 subkernels). Im not sure whether I have to explicitly specify the kernel weights as hyperparameters, or if they are autodetected and optimized during model selection. If I have to explicitly specify the weights, how do I do this (in
