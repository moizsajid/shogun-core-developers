 serialhex	sonne|work: hey, i just got the link & i'll read it when i have time, ttyl!!
 blackburn	what's up guys?
@sonney2k	serialhex, thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, waiting for you to fix bugs :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, no measures sorry...
 blackburn	sonney2k: out of power today
@sonney2k	blackburn, but it seems like it will be published in some shorter format at the google blog
@sonney2k	blackburn, like yesterday :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: heh
 blackburn	no, yesterday was ok but I don't know what is to focus on
@sonney2k	blackburn, fix the bugs
 blackburn	I have already tried
@sonney2k	but?
 blackburn	and as I said - the results look ok
 blackburn	but not the same
 blackburn	no idea what is wrong
@sonney2k	blackburn, why not debug it then?
 blackburn	I will make a try later
@sonney2k	blackburn, which tests do still fail btw?
 blackburn	sonney2k: locality improved, poly with FK and one more string kernel I can't remember
@sonney2k	that's all?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	so they don't crash but just results are different?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
@sonney2k	could be that default kernel normlization changed
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will check
 blackburn	away for dinner
 blackburn	sonney2k: well if kernel normalization changed all the kernels shouldn't work?
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: how can normalization affect only three kernels?
@sonney2k	blackburn, because it was only changed for 3 kernels
 blackburn	ah I see
@sonney2k	we are not talking about changing the normalization code
@sonney2k	but just the default normalization for these kernels
 blackburn	sonney2k: there is no special normalizer for localityimproved
 blackburn	oh fuck
 blackburn	locality improved not local alignment

 serialhex_0x	ok cool :)  doing support sucks!
 blackburn	my salary sucks though :D
 serialhex_0x	(though having people yell at you cause your software dosnt work like they expect it sucks too)
