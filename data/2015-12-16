 rcurtin	lisitsyn: I think the idea of labeling source via git blame and ordering authors by lines of code committed is really cool.  if you do this, maybe you can point me at the code you used so maybe I can do the same to our code in mlpack? :)

 lordon	Hey guys, maybe one of you guys can help me, I want to do some machine learning stuff with shoguns Ruby modular interface. Unfortunately, when I do exactly the same with Python and Ruby I get different results (The Ruby one is rather bad...) - here you can find two Jupyter notebooks with PCA as example: Python: http://bit.ly/1I9hJhP Ruby: http://bit.ly/1NTw3M3 Any idea?

@besser82	lordon, that might be because of the ruy-interpreter...
@besser82	ruby
@besser82	lordon, which OS are you using?

 lisitsyn	uhm this is quite bad
 lordon	besser82, I'm using Ubuntu versions 14.10 and 15.04 LTS, ruby 2.2.2 MRI (using rbenv)
@besser82	lisitsyn, ?
 lisitsyn	from the example I see typemaps seem to be ok
 lisitsyn	but somehow results differ
@besser82	lordon, so your Ruby interpreter is compiled from scratch?
@besser82	lisitsyn, mhh...  so testsuite-data is faulty, too?  :/
 lisitsyn	why?
@besser82	lisitsyn, for me ruby-tests are passing...  so the precomputed results are differing, i asume?
@besser82	like we compare with pickles in python-testsuite
 lisitsyn	not sure if it is covered
@besser82	lisitsyn, just checked...  It isn't covered
@besser82	:(
 lisitsyn	I am not sure where error could happen
 lisitsyn	I mean under the hood it is the same C++ code
 lisitsyn	so typemaps?
@besser82	So we just check if functions in the interface are working
 lisitsyn	but if they glitch they like explode
@besser82	lisitsyn, maybe some difference in float handling with ruby?
@besser82	like the interp handled float-precision differently
 lisitsyn	uh should not change it that much
@besser82	like with python between ix86 and x86_64  :/
@besser82	possibly it's some differnce in numpy vs. narray
@besser82	I'll check that tomorrow
 lisitsyn	besser82: oh would be nice if you get some time
@besser82	doing some random (but similar values) float arithmetics with numpy vs. narray and see the outcome
@besser82	lisitsyn, I'll do my best...  :P
@besser82	lordon, ^ see backlog;  might be because of narray...  Needs some more investigation
@besser82	It's bed-time for me, now...  Godd N8, folks!  =)
 lordon	besser82 yes, rbenv install compiles ruby from scratch.. thank you guys! I was wondering because I thought the same C++ things were called, too...
