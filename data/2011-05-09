 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you plan to change internals for SGVector, etc usage?

@sonney2k	blackburn, would love to
@sonney2k	not sure if I have time to do it now.
 blackburn	me too
 blackburn	but I think we could do it during summer
@sonney2k	maybe a first step is to put the struct definition in DataType.h
 blackburn	I think we should make definition and then convert one algo to its usage
@sonney2k	there is one problem though
 blackburn	which?
@sonney2k	typemaps need to be adjusted
 blackburn	ah, yeap
@sonney2k	so that means we have to add another round of typemaps
@sonney2k	(to not break anything inbetween)
@sonney2k	and then gradually remove the others
 blackburn	so well when I will have holidays (mid of june - .. )
 blackburn	may be I will do it for GaussianNaiveBayes
 blackburn	with typemaps, etc
 blackburn	if everything will work fine - we will convert others gradually
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you recommend some BLAS/ATLAS tutorial?
@sonney2k	blackburn, it may actually be simpler to do the typemaps...
@sonney2k	with SGVector etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, I only ever used this lapack / blas overview pdf that you find in the net
@sonney2k	there is a book though
 blackburn	ok
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am currently finishing the malloc / realloc / free -> SG_MALLOC etc transition
 blackburn	where?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need to use atlas for solving systems of linear equations, right?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	and cblas for other routines, like dot product
@sonney2k	otherwise it will be tough
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we have example of atlas usage in shogun? I got stucked with setting it up
@sonney2k	blackburn, PCACut.cpp or dot product in lib/Mathematics.h or in pr_loqo.cpp
 blackburn	seems PCACut use only blas..
 blackburn	same thing in Mathematics.h
@sonney2k	compute_eigenvectors in Math uses dsyev
@sonney2k	that is eigenvectors/values for symmetric doubl ematrix
 blackburn	ah!
 blackburn	thank you
 blackburn	sonney2k: what is wrap_**?
 blackburn	ah, I see
 blackburn	it is in lapack.h
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem was related to my bad atlas installation
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah there are problems with when things are available in atlas or lapack only and different os / libs make a difference
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: question now is should I add needed functions to lib/lapack.h or can I use it straight?
@sonney2k	blackburn, preferably add it to lapack.h (wrap_*) and then use it
@sonney2k	in case one has to change it later it will be easier to modify it there
 blackburn	aha! I see
 blackburn	thanks! you helped me very much

 blackburn	sonney2k: what is the purpose of SG_MALLOC, SG_FREE, SG_REALLOC?
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	in new code we should use SG_MALLOC, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, usually new[] new()
@sonney2k	but never malloc / realloc / free but the SG_* things instead
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	it just has the advantage that you never need to check for NULL ptr's

 Daniel	Hi Sonney
 Daniel	Sonney2K?
 Daniel	You had told me to use ./configure --interfaces=libshogun,csharp  to compile the csharp typemap when it was ready
 Daniel	but I got "Unknown interface: csharp"
 Daniel	this was on the code where you had added the csharp folder
 Daniel	I emailed you
 Daniel	take care

@sonney2k	Daniel no I told you to use csharp_modular
@sonney2k	sigh too late
 blackburn	what's up, sonney2k?
@sonney2k	blackburn, please have a look at the datatype
 CIA-90	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * ra996050 / src/libshogun/lib/DataType.h : draft definition for vector / matrix datatype - http://bit.ly/mOSESQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think we should rename things to SGVector SGMatrix, SGSparseVector, SGSparseMatrix, SGString
 blackburn	of course, I don't like T*
@sonney2k	blackburn, but have a look first
 blackburn	already
 blackburn	sonney2k: what you think about implementing operations for it using blas, for example dot product
 blackburn	do you*
 blackburn	ehhrr my english is becoming worse every day :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, makes sense - but we shouldn't over do it - there are many matrix/vector packages around that probably do a better job then us
 blackburn	anyway it is better way
 blackburn	because we can change all the things just changing implementation of sgvector
@sonney2k	on the other hand it is very convenient and more clean - we could just implement the functions that are needed anyways
@sonney2k	it will probably make some functions in *features and *math* obsolete
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about +, * overloading? I think it is a bad practice
@sonney2k	lets not do that now
 blackburn	it looks undetermined
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we really need template matrix type?
 blackburn	I mean almost all of them are float
@sonney2k	blackburn, almost all yes - but not e.g. images
 blackburn	may be we could have some shorthand name
 blackburn	SGFloatMatrix or so
 blackburn	ohhh overloading [] for matrices could be goooood
 blackburn	z_transposed[dim*j+d] -= feature_vector[d];
 blackburn	pfff

@sonney2k	blackburn, overloading [] for 2d is not possible -
 blackburn	ah.. yeah, forgot
@sonney2k	I guess you want sth like set   / get functions
 blackburn	yeap because that X*Y+Z is pretty unreadable if it is not your own code
@sonney2k	and it can probably be done more efficiently using some matrix lib like eigen anyways
@sonney2k	btw having SGFloatmatrix etc is not really necessary - typemaps can have type specific implementations if needed
 blackburn	ok
 blackburn	I don't know which is most efficient, but we should use that one :)
@bettyboo	interesting
@sonney2k	going to bed now
@sonney2k	l8r
 blackburn	good night
@sonney2k	the mighty diaper master leaves the room
 blackburn	:D
