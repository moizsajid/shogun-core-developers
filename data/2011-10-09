 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
 blackburn	I decided to not integrate covertree this time - JL's implementation is shity while DNCrane stl'y implementation is even slower than my

 blackburn	sonney2k: I miss you ;(
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, why did you give up?
 blackburn	sonney2k: with covertree?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	JL's one crashes all the time
 blackburn	DNCrane's one is even slower than it is now
 blackburn	I have no time now to rewrite it
 blackburn	and well it is not a bottleneck of my algos
 blackburn	sonney2k: how about making my algos Machines?
@sonney2k	blackburn, does JL's crash when you apply it w/o your modifications?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just made it compilable, checked diff
 blackburn	it crashes not often
 blackburn	but I get wrong neighbors
 blackburn	I spent two days trying to make it work - no success
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/shogun/drawing-1.png how about that?
 blackburn	I was lazy to make it pure uml but
@sonney2k	blackburn, if it crashes then you should create a reproducible test case and send it to JL
@sonney2k	or give me the test case and I will ask him
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think you can drop the shogun:: in these figures
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you gain when making them machines?
 blackburn	sonney2k: possible easier integration with heiko's parameter searching stuff, avoid things like I do in kpca and kernel lle
 blackburn	but I see some impossible troubles: apply returns labels - I have no labels
 blackburn	it could be still available as preprocessor by DimensionReductionPreprocessor proxy
