 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rb9d67bb / (5 files in 4 dirs): add SGMatrix support in python typemaps - http://bit.ly/jB5H5I
@sonney2k	blackburn, I only now realized that we have another naming clash
@sonney2k	what I call sparse matrix now is actually only a sparse vector
@sonney2k	so I will have to do renamings to SGSparseVector etc
@sonney2k	and introduce SGSparseMatrix
@sonney2k	same for strings btw
@sonney2k	SGString
@sonney2k	will need to introduce SGStringList
 blackburn	sonney2k: ehh, but do we have sparse vectors already?
@sonney2k	sure but called SGSparseFeatureMatrix or so
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need some advice with LLE
 blackburn	what is better - to allocate memory for all instance life or only within init()?
@sonney2k	blackburn, ask but I am not sure if mlsec/cwidmer could help better here
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand
 blackburn	sonney2k: not about algorithmic but about pure programming ;)
@bettyboo	rahaha!?!
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	I mean I have to allocate some matrices
 blackburn	should I allocate it within init() method
 blackburn	or better allocate it with constructor?
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know the sizes before calling init?
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	do you use them 'often'
 blackburn	sorry of course not
 blackburn	oh how stupid I am
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: another question about that preproc framework
 blackburn	ehh.
 blackburn	well, we have apply_to_feature_matrix and apply_to_feature_vector
 blackburn	if to matrix I understand, it will call init, etc
 blackburn	but what about vector?
 blackburn	should I use already initialized features?
 blackburn	sonney2k: https://github.com/SergeyLisitsyn/shogun/blob/274a2fefe4de3c82dc5c585e89ab3edd336a12b0/src/libshogun/preproc/LLE.cpp
@sonney2k	blackburn, you have to assume that your preproc is inited
 blackburn	now all routines are in init
 blackburn	I'm stucked what to do with apply_* methods
@sonney2k	so that you can apply it to single vectors (when the feature matrix is not avalable in memory)
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw we have a CMath::display_matrix()
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok, will know
 blackburn	it just some crap not cleaned up
 blackburn	of course there wouldn't be any sg_print :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: so, when apply_to_feature_matrix is called I should re-init (or init) with given features, right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, never re-init
@sonney2k	always assume that you are inited
 blackburn	I'm confused what exactly I should do in init()
 blackburn	sonney2k: if it is inited already why CFeatures instance is passed to apply_to_feature_matrix?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand - it should apply ti to the CFeatures object that is passed...
 blackburn	but what should init(CFeatures* f) do?
@sonney2k	example:
 blackburn	I can't see any relation between two different features..
@sonney2k	you want to remove features which have small variance
@sonney2k	then you measure variance on init() and recall which dims should be removed
@sonney2k	then when you call apply* you use that list
 blackburn	ah!
 blackburn	sonney2k: but what about dim reduction techniques like LLE? it is absolutely determined to feature set
 blackburn	we can't init on one feature set and process other
 blackburn	do you understand my miscomprehension?
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	eeeh
 blackburn	nevermind :)
@bettyboo	cool
 blackburn	will try to understand how it is done with pca
 blackburn	ah don't understand how to do it with LLE
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you implement addition of two SGVectors?
 blackburn	and I'm interested with scalar multiplication too
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r7b958bf / (57 files in 14 dirs):
 CIA-31	shogun: rename sparse matrix to sparse vector and introduce sparse matrix
 CIA-31	shogun: structure and string list structure - http://bit.ly/j1Sl11
@sonney2k	blackburn, I won't - but feel free to do so
@sonney2k	btw, have a look at DataType.h and tell me if that is OK
 blackburn	I don't understand why you are asking me for that (in fact I can't grasp preproc) :)
 blackburn	oh nice I switched branch and lost LLE :D
@sonney2k	hard to believe
@sonney2k	switch back!
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	will get from github
 blackburn	but I was surprised
 blackburn	EHRRR i'm useless
@sonney2k	blackburn, bah get some sleep or eat more chocolate ;-)
@bettyboo	8)
 blackburn	sonney2k: should ops on vectors be implemented as its methods?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes makes most sense - at some point this does no longer belong in datatype.h though - but for now yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: SGVector.add(a,b)?
@sonney2k	no only add(v)
 blackburn	it is less readable, don't you think so/
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	i think it is more readable - it adds v to the current object
 blackburn	moreover it doesn't copy vector
 blackburn	but what if we want x,y and x+y both?
@sonney2k	 sorry what?
@sonney2k	ahh I understand
@sonney2k	well then feel free to add another function for this
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about zero vector constructor?
@sonney2k	blackburn, implement what you need...
 blackburn	ok.
@sonney2k	blackburn, you probably can take much of what is in CMath* now
@sonney2k	e.g. dot, fill vector range_fill vector etct etc
 blackburn	anyway my addition doesn't compile yet :D
