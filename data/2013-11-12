 sonne|osx	wiking: yes
 sonne|osx	wiking: do we want abstracts?
-!- benibadman [~benibadma@94.135.236.129] has joined #shogun
@wiking	sonne|osx: i think we need to change this
@wiking	into a grid
 sonne|osx	wiking: do whatever css magic you want
@wiking	hah huuge matrix
@wiking	sonne|osx: on the end lets export this into a csv
@wiking	and load that into a html with jquery
@wiking	or?
 sonne|osx	wiking: I have a python script for that already
 sonne|osx	wiking: problem is this needs to be updated
 sonne|osx	shogun and other toolboxes can do much more by now
@wiking	heheh yeah
 sonne|osx	wiking: this is what we did in end of 2009 http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/jmlr10/
 sonne|osx	back then we had this on our homepage - maybe you remember?
@wiking	yep
 sonne|osx	wiking: my plan would be to do manual syncs only
 sonne|osx	wiking: as in save the .csv from time to time
 sonne|osx	wiking: and then export this into two static templates
 sonne|osx	that we then display

 sonne|work	hey lisitsyn any news in the ????? world?
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: hah
 lisitsyn	sonne|work: I'll try to find some time to update the table
@wiking	sonne|work: check it out now
@wiking	sonne|work: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/
 sonne|work	wiking: rather make it 3 cols only
 sonne|work	wiking: question is if we want abstracts again or keep the figures...
 sonne|work	wiking: hmmhh and clicking on the figures doesn't work?
 sonne|work	when I click I am back at cloud.* ?
@wiking	sonne|work: lick this?
 sonne|work	wiking: less space between the boxes :)
@wiking	sonne|work: as i think you are not logged in..
@wiking	sonne|work: ok check out the bootstrap css and tell me the code: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid
 sonne|work	wiking: yes I am not but IIRC I could click on a notebook and then it logged me in
@wiking	well it's not going to self-login
@wiking	you have to push on the button
@wiking	other than that it worksforme
@wiking	i've clicked on the image it put me back to the login page (same page basically) then i've pushed github
@wiking	and then i've just got the notebook
@wiking	btw of course this is confusing
@wiking	but you wrote this
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah that is confusing to peple
@wiking	sonne|work: it's your work
 sonne|work	well maybe a separate login page
@wiking	sonne|work: again... you commmited this into the repo
 sonne|work	wiking: .col-md-1 ?
@wiking	that's for medium devices
@wiking	i.e only for desktop
@wiking	here's an updated
@wiking	http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org/
 sonne|work	wiking: well basically just the 3 pictures concatenated horizontally but only 3 in a row
 sonne|work	no spaces
@wiking	?
@wiking	it's going to be like this
@wiking	4 cols and done
 sonne|work	looks still weird
@wiking	here's md2
@wiking	but that'll need work
@wiking	(i.e. try to resize the browser that you are currently watching the site)
@wiking	ok it's updated
@wiking	i mean the git repo
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah like this but only 3 columns!
@wiking	?
@wiking	what do u mean by 3 columns?
 sonne|work	3 images per row
@wiking	ah yeah
@wiking	the js needs update then
@wiking	if(i % 3 == 0) <add new row>
 sonne|work	yeah
@wiking	how do you get reference in js for the last "row"
 sonne|work	sorry what?
@wiking	well since there's going to be more than one <div class="row">
@wiking	how can i get a reference to the last row
@wiking	?
@wiking	as $(".row").append()
 sonne|work	hmmh can you give it an id too?
 sonne|work	or a rel?
 sonne|work	then you could distinguish it by that

@wiking	sonne|work: yes as i'm trying to fix it... the row things
@wiking	sonne|work: <div id="row-2">
@wiking	how do you refere this in jquery
 sonne|work	$("#row-2").
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	yeah i thought so
@wiking	but it doesnt work
@wiking	:<
@wiking	                               var currRow="#row-"+currRowID;
@wiking	this is ok?
 sonne|work	yes
@wiking	sonne|work: http://cloud.shogun-toolbox.org:5001/
@wiking	and as u can see it does not work
 sonne|work	wiking: maybe the div is not yet closed?
@wiking	sonne|work: i've just fixed that
@wiking	sonne|work: <div id="row-0" class="row"></div>
@wiking	but they are empty
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea right now I can debug this on the train ride back
@wiking	ok done
@wiking	there's a .last() for the selector in jquery

@wiking	sonne|work: i'm just adding libarchive support for shogun
 sonne|work	wiking: cool do it :)
@wiking	sonne|work: i thought that the whole thing should be wrapped directly into CFile
@wiking	as then we can both process LibSVM and CSV archived
@wiking	although there's gonna be a problem
 sonne|work	wiking: cloud looks nice now - the only confusing thing is we should have some separte login page
@wiking	when somebody is going to feed a tar.gz with a lot of files in it ;P
@wiking	sonne|work: afaik some kind of an iframe solution woudl be good

@wiking	sonne|work: i'm about to update our docker image for 0.6.6 release.. that makes it possible to actually map the ipython notebook server on the lo NIC. this way we will just tunnel on the website between localhost:PORT and the web
 sonne|work	wiking: sounds good too

 sonne|work	wiking: did you actually do a backup of fatbot yet?
 sonne|work	wiking: the alternative is I buy some 4TB drive for 200EUR from shogun money and we would have daily backups with bacula
@wiking	sonne|work: yeah i'm setting up the script
@wiking	sonne|work: should waste money on the backup
@wiking	as i said before i have 2T free
 sonne|work	yeah then do it :)
 sonne|work	perfect
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess an rsync every week is good enough for this

@wiking	sonne|work: i guess an iframe for login would be sufficient
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't see what you have in mind - anything that goes to an extra page or so would do even a LOGIN tab at the top with some text and the 2 buttons underneath
@wiking	sonne|work: click on gallery -> iframe tab with [github] [gooble] buttons
 sonne|work	yeah but why an iframe? I mean you could just have this in a div?
 sonne|work	apart from that yes
@wiking	like this?
@wiking	(login tab does not work yet)
@wiking	ok tab is done

 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	wiking: and there is some space left and right of the text
 sonne|work	so when you resize it looks weird
@wiking	intentional
@wiking	jumbotron css
@wiking	i wanted to add this to the about page as well
@wiking	but it looks really weird with the white backgrounded images

@wiking	it's not the best coding but it works
@wiking	mmm scikit-learn is not included >
@wiking	:<
@wiking	oh there is
@wiking	lisitsyn: ping
 lisitsyn	wiking: damn you rock
 lisitsyn	wiking: pong
 lisitsyn	!
@wiking	lisitsyn: lasso classifiction
@wiking	do we have that?
@wiking	i know we have lasso
@wiking	but i thought that's for some feature hax0ring
@wiking	btw we do have now bgfs binding or?
 lisitsyn	wiking: we have bfgs inside
@wiking	ok then we have
@wiking	;)
 lisitsyn	wiking: we have least angle regression that is lasso regression
 lisitsyn	wiking: we also have L1 regularized shit I'd call lasso
@wiking	regression but not classification right?
 lisitsyn	so put a plus here
@wiking	i have no clue what's a lasso classifier?
 lisitsyn	it is not that obvious but we have algorithm to solve that problem
@wiking	i guess it's somethat that is based on lasso regression.?
 lisitsyn	wiking: L1 regularized SVM
@wiking	ah i see
@wiking	ok
@wiking	we have
 lisitsyn	wiking: well L1 regularized ERM whatever
 lisitsyn	no matter what loss
@wiking	RVM?
@wiking	Relevance Vector Machine?
 lisitsyn	wiking: no relevance vector machine
 lisitsyn	IIRC
@wiking	mmm we should add the various SOSVM solvers somewhere
 lisitsyn	wiking: I don't recall if it is some weighted svm or what
@wiking	i guess in a separete group
@wiking	sonne|work: what did 'Visualization' stand for in 'General Features'
@wiking	?
@wiking	Structural Output Learning
@wiking	should be a new section right?
@wiking	added ;P
@wiking	iglesiasg: ping
@iglesiasg	wiking, tell me
@wiking	iglesiasg: what should be in the feature matrix for Structural Output Learning
@wiking	?
@iglesiasg	wiking, label sequence learning
@iglesiasg	bundle solvers
@iglesiasg	these bundle methods for risk minimization I mean
@wiking	iglesiasg: bmrm and the others?
@wiking	iglesiasg: factor graph?
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	about factor graph
@wiking	what should we write there?
@iglesiasg	I am checking exactly what inference method Hushell put
@wiking	i mean we have SOSGD
@wiking	which is cool
@iglesiasg	MAP inference
@iglesiasg	yeah sure, SGD
@iglesiasg	so to put it with some order
@iglesiasg	models: label sequence learning and factor graph via MAP inference
@iglesiasg	solvers: bundle methods and SGD or pegasos they call it too
@iglesiasg	and your latent stuff of course
@wiking	Label Sequence Learning
@wiking	Factor Graph Learning
@wiking	SO-SGD
@wiking	Latent SO-SVM
@wiking	i have these until now
@wiking	for Structural Output Learning
@wiking	oh man ICA is not even part of this

 Jagged	https://pastee.org/bsavm any thoughts on where to start looking to figure this one out?
@wiking	Jagged: more context plz
 Jagged	ok im at lunch right now
@wiking	nw
-!- lisitsyn1 [~lisitsyn@80.252.20.67] has joined #shogun
 Jagged	ok, so the idea I had was some other program I have would determine some binary svm classifier, and record the trained svm and kernel to some files, whereupon some other utility could pull from them to evaluate them against another data set
 Jagged	i wasn't familiar enough with what functions are implemented at which hierachical level, so my initial attempt at just reading kernel parameters from a file into a generic CKernel didn't work, so now I'm just assuming I know a priori the kernel type which originated its file... I was hoping that by saving the kernel to a file I wouldn't need to find some other means of storing and retrieving kernel parameters (like width)
 Jagged	https://pastee.org/5r5wq
 Jagged	that's my evaluation routine that my secondary programs use.
 Jagged	the SVM is trained with 3 features, 1200 vectors.  I have no problem evaluating data vectors with length 4022 and 2011
 Jagged	but when I have the 804 vector data set, there appears to be indexing problems
 Jagged	I'll admit that my understanding of the inner workings is minimal (I only took an introductory AI class at university), and sometimes that is the cause of errors like this (I encounter that problem helping people with GNURadio... as not many people understand the underlying DSP theories when they use it)
