 kislay	lisitsyn,  this is for this nb: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2430
@lisitsyn	kislay: I mean are these images licensed?
 kislay	well, yeah.
 kislay	I took them from a mixture of places
 kislay	2 to 3 different places. I think I should add the license in the nb reference.
 kislay	lisitsyn, will that be okay?
@lisitsyn	I am not sure we are clean license-wise already :D
@lisitsyn	but well you can't add whatever license you have
@lisitsyn	err I mean whatever license you want
 kislay	so whats the solution?
@lisitsyn	this is important as recently a few repos were just like deleted from github
@lisitsyn	because of license issues
 kislay	oh!!!
 kislay	I don't wanna be the culprit.
@lisitsyn	hah yeah so we probably want it to be clean
 kislay	The place from where I took mentioned that the user can cite them whenever used. They were public
@lisitsyn	cite them or distribute them?
 kislay	err.. you are getting technical.
@wiking	kislay: because it's important
 kislay	let me check.
@lisitsyn	e.g. there is MIT-CBCL faces dataset
@lisitsyn	you can use it cite it whatever
@lisitsyn	but you can't distribute
@lisitsyn	and I think I violate it at some point but nobody cares yet :D
@wiking	:>>>>
@lisitsyn	not in shogun though
@lisitsyn	in shogun I added my own dataset for that :D
@lisitsyn	shogun-data is full of some various license stuff
@wiking	lisitsyn: let's put everything to be under ABRMS license
@lisitsyn	wiking: hahah never knew about this license
@wiking	best license :)
@lisitsyn	wiking: anti-gnu movement gets strong :D
 kislay	there's not much written here : http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/databases.html#TUD
 kislay	i took it from above
 kislay	pascal challenge
@wiking	pascal is ok
 kislay	cool :)
@wiking	it's eu funded project
@wiking	it has to be public licensed
 kislay	yup.
@lisitsyn	kislay: ok then just put a file LICENSE
@lisitsyn	just to that folder
@lisitsyn	and copy that thing
@lisitsyn	then we are ok
 kislay	ok.
