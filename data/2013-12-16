 besser82	sonne|work: shall I CC you in shogun-review for fedora?
 sonne|work	besser82: why not
 sonne|work	besser82: is this with your new cmake magic already or the old one?
 besser82	sonne|work: I thought you possibly don't want to get spammed ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: No, actually the 3.0.0 tarball.  Cmake-magic on the way  ;)
 sonne|work	well I am good at ignoring things
 besser82	sonne|work: :D
 besser82	sonne|work: Which addy shall i use for cc?
 sonne|work	@shogun-toolbox.org one
 besser82	sonne|work: allrighty! will do  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: Looks like one needs to be registered with redhat-bugzilla be CC'ed  :(
 besser82	sonne|work: have you any expirience with mono-shogun on ARM?
 besser82	sonne|work: it's segfaulting in my builds  :(
 besser82	sonne|work: i suspect mono as the reason...
 besser82	sonne|work: build.log  --->  http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//work/tasks/6886/6296886/build.log
 sonne|work	besser82: this is 3.0?
 besser82	sonne|work: yes, 3.0.0 release-tarball
 sonne|work	it looks like the same kind of c# exceptions we are getting now with 3.1dev
 besser82	sonne|work: is it really caused by 3.1dev or has there been some mono update?
 besser82	sonne|work: since this happenes for me on ARMv7hl, only.  ix86 / amd64 runs smoothly
 sonne|work	then it is different
 sonne|work	we have that on x86 / amd64 too
 besser82	sonne|work: Since the problem is on ARM only, I suspect the mono-stack...
 besser82	sonne|work: mhhh... but might be related somehow...
 besser82	sonne|work: you have links to logs?
 sonne|work	yeah but mono is ultra hard to debug
 sonne|work	besser82: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/2095/steps/test%20csharp%20modular/logs/stdio
 besser82	sonne|work: that's why we have some mono-guys around @rh / fedora  :-P
 besser82	sonne|work: this log actually lacks gdb-output  :(
 besser82	sonne|work: hard to say if there is some relation between them...
 sonne|work	besser82: how did you get the gdb output?
 besser82	sonne|work: ask me sth...
 besser82	sonne|work: Actually I just run testsuite as usual and the I get the output on the build-worker...
 besser82	sonne|work: but there is some gdb-plugin for mono, afaik, which gets loaded...
 besser82	sonne|work: I can ask those rel-eng guys how they do that....
 besser82	sonne|work: Shall I try to do some scratch-build of recent checkout on them build-workers?
 besser82	sonne|work: in Koji I mean...  and give you the logs?
 sonne|work	besser82: that would be nice - I am totally left in the dark why the mono stuff crashes
 besser82	sonne|work: I suspect sth like: "previous frame identical to this frame (corrupt stack?)"
 besser82	sonne|work: So currupted stack or releated...
 sonne|work	besser82: it can also be a subtle bug in our typemaps or even swig
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: zxtx
 besser82	sonne|work: for 3.1dev possibly, but for 3.0.0?
 sonne|work	yeah there wasn't any change for ages
 sonne|work	so no
 besser82	sonne|work: for 3.0.0release I actually suspect problems related to the stack on $ARCH  ;)
-!- Netsplit over, joins: zxtx
* sonne|work too
 besser82	sonne|work: localy testing my pimped to 3.1dev spec  ;)  If works then I'll upload to Koji in drop-in the url for you  ;)
 sonne|work	:)
 besser82	sonne|work: most of the local test is about the scrub of SVM^shit  :-P
 besser82	sonne|work: Uploading srpm: /home/besser82/rpmbuild/SRPMS/shogun-3.1.0-0.0.1.git20131212.70e774d.fc20.src.rpm

 besser82	iglesiasg, wiking, sonney2k, sonne|work, lisitsyn: btw. I'm wondering whether shogun has a sat-solver for boolean decision-trees?!?
@iglesiasg	besser82, hmm no that I am aware of
 besser82	iglesiasg, wiking, sonney2k, sonne|work, lisitsyn: or decisions based on a scenario to get the best possible outcome...
 besser82	iglesiasg, wiking, sonney2k, sonne|work, lisitsyn: ok, next thing to put on my list ;)
@iglesiasg	hehe

 sonne|work	besser82: the error really /is/ different
 besser82	sonne|work: as I actually expected  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: 3.1dev has some real problem with the swig_wrapper.cxx i suppose...
 sonne|work	but only mono...
 sonne|work	which is pretty weird
 sonne|work	it seems to be some refcounting issue
 besser82	sonne|work: mono is somewhat arkward...
 besser82	sonne|work: Who needs that, btw?!?
 besser82	sonne|work: I mean is Mono / C# really a good platform for ML stuff?
 sonne|work	besser82: since you get it almost for free with swig it is not really us to decide.
 besser82	sonne|work: I see...
 besser82	sonne|work: But is it worth the afford fixing that?
 sonne|work	what the 3.1 one? yes the 3.0 one is likely a mono bug so no
 besser82	sonne|work: btw. SWIG....
 sonne|work	?
 besser82	sonne|work: We need to do some serious tracing why it eats memory like chocolate  ;)
 sonne|work	could be a bug in swig too but no idea
 sonne|work	well I know.
 besser82	sonne|work: unlikely a bug with swig...
 sonne|work	it generates a huuuge table with function pointers
 sonne|work	and these functions are all static wrapper functions that it generates
 besser82	sonne|work: 3.0 mono runs smoothly with rawhide  ;)
 sonne|work	on arm too?
 besser82	sonne|work: but 1.5 Gbytes / make-thread?
 besser82	sonne|work: no, but arm
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	the table is big
 besser82	sonne|work: but that is a bug with mono-stack itself
 sonne|work	and it is actually 3-4GB even
 sonne|work	when compiling the wrap.cxx
 besser82	sonne|work: building with -j8 takes ~12 Gbytes of mem  :(
 sonne|work	no
 besser82	sonne|work: It does  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: i have all modules enabled, but java, R an perl
 sonne|work	well if you compile libshogun in parallel it should just take a few hundred M
 sonne|work	but if you build the modular interfaces
 besser82	sonne|work: libshogun, is small
 sonne|work	and so compile the *_wrap.cxx
 sonne|work	it will eat ~3GB for each
 besser82	sonne|work: when SWIG runs mem is melting
 sonne|work	but swig is 'just' a gig or so
 besser82	sonne|work: swig takes ~1.5 G at peak
 sonne|work	yeah we need d-ptr's that will fix things
 besser82	sonne|work: :D
 sonne|work	or sane modules
 besser82	sonne|work: even better  :D
 besser82	sonne|work: we need some asian to do that  :-P
 besser82	sonne|work: `c'mon do math..` *lol*
 besser82	sonne|work: seems to be a lot of work in fromt of us...
 sonne|work	not too much but time is the problem

@iglesiasg	besser82, nice!
 sonney2k_	besser82, what?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, any news on the mono issue?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, could you please fill out https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HfYUE890vdSGXyOyUoqC8AP1PPQ5zdktppo-JsVN5xo/viewform
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: ah yeah I have answered this guy
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, fill out this form
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, one more request... could you do some multitask/lasso / other domain adaptation notebook over x-mas? It would be good if you work is not lost / hidden too deep within shogun...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: yeah I will have like 8 days in january
 lisitsyn	I hope this would work
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: I am now having the deadlinest week of the year :D
 besser82	sonney2k_:???
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, I know what you mean... same here
 sonney2k_	besser82, I totally didn't understand what you said
 besser82	sonney2k_:  Shogun is in Fedora!  ;)
 besser82	sonney2k_:  http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=6301365
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, we should really go over each project you did and at least get it documented - same thing for wiking and iglesiasg and myself of course
 lisitsyn	that's true
 sonney2k_	currently it really is -> no notebook exists -> it doesn't exist at all!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, about the mono issue, I have tested it further but found no reason yet
 sonney2k_	besser82, wow! that was quick!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, let me show you sth
 besser82	sonney2k_:  It just a nice side-effect for having it in for Fedoras 10th birthday  ;)
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, could you reproduce it at least?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, yeah, sure
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, could you tweet about this?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, about the error? :D
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, I mean shogun -> fedora in FC20?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, :P
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, sure, give me a couple of minutes
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, about the error, so this example for instance is one of them that fail https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/csharp_modular/kernel_gaussian_modular.cs
 lisitsyn	haha
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.181.207] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 lisitsyn	We have terrible failure here, Cheers
 lisitsyn	good idea for some twitter account huh
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, yeah I know - it fails on the buildbot
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, so even if everything is commented and only the RealFeatures in line 11 are created (so pretty much the program remains init_shogun, create RealFeatures, exit_shogun)
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, haha we have it for years :D
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, it crashes!
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, hmmhh
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, and can you make it even simpler:
 lisitsyn	we could have a twitter for a bug
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, like just x=GaussianKernel()
 lisitsyn	Still crashes
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, init shogun and exit work
 lisitsyn	Still crashes
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, go work on your deadline :P
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: I have no idea how to make it work till this morning lol
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, I mean it is pretty obvious sth with refcounting isn't working...
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, does it work with just x=GaussianKernel() ?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, I have just managed to run the c# examples using ctest yet
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, so I have not tried to gdb it and so on yet
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, yeah no problem but could you just run that example?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, because here it does *not* crash
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, with ctest or alone?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, ./check.sh
@iglesiasg	are you sure it is really running everything with ./check.sh?
@iglesiasg	I tried that too
@iglesiasg	but didn't work out so I went for ctest
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, yes
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, can you try the minimal example x=GaussianKernel() then?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, *all* examples work here
@iglesiasg	hm ok
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, what about with ctest in your machine?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, that is why I am asking you to try the minimal one...
@iglesiasg	I cannot do it right now
 lisitsyn	one-class svm experience for object recognition anyone?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, what are the cmake options you used?
 sonney2k_	lisitsyn, same as always YMMV
 lisitsyn	sonney2k_: yeah it appears to be totally useless to know right people :D
 lisitsyn	doesn't help!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, CSharpModular=ON CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON IIRC
@iglesiasg	I use ccmake so I tune them in the menu, but those are the important ones I believe
@iglesiasg	retweet guys ;)
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, it doesn't compile the csharp examples ehre with cmake...
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, what error do you get?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, have you installed all the packages that are installed in travis?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, maybe cmake is configured to compile them with another compiler
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, which would make sense with the fact that you can run the examples without problems using ./check.sh
@iglesiasg	so as you said the other day, maybe the error just happens with a c# compiler... funny
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, seems like it is the mono compiler version that makes a difference
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, when I use gmcs it works
 sonney2k_	when I use dmcs it fails
 sonney2k_	when I use mcs it works too
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, mmm what is your version of gmcs?
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, I have here 2.10.8.1 and I guess that travis is using the same
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, travis is using dmcs
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, aham! Since mono-gmcs is the package installed, I thought gmcs was the compiler
@iglesiasg	but there is some unpacking mono-dmcs in travis log too... so I cannot really tell which one is used really
@iglesiasg	it must be in some cmake variable
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, when I uninstall gmcs it compiles with cmake
@iglesiasg	haha that is an ultimate proof of it then! :)
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, so it fails with ctest in your system too?
 sonney2k_	iglesiasg, with dmcs
 sonney2k_	it fails
 besser82	iglesiasg, sonney2_: for me it segfaults regardless of gmcs or dmcs or mcs...

@HeikoS	what do you mean?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, segmentation?
 lisitsyn	say I have keypoints on image
 lisitsyn	I have some observation that the locations of keypoints tell pretty much
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: segment what?
@HeikoS	use a kernel on sets
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: like distance?

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: there are some more involved things
@HeikoS	like a gaussian like thing on sets

@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, if ref was not used before this change https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1771
@iglesiasg	then it would make perfect sense
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, yep I think that is it
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, SGRefObject ::ref()
@iglesiasg	that method is new
@iglesiasg	arrgh not really
@iglesiasg	before there was SGObject::ref()
@iglesiasg	sonney2k_, does it still make sense to you?
