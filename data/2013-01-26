 n4nd0	blackburn: meeting in about 25min right?
 blackburn	n4nd0: I think so
 n4nd0	:)
* sonney2k starts preparations
* sonney2k opens bottle of beer 
@sonney2k	blackburn, grab your vodka
 blackburn	sonney2k: ready
@sonney2k	blackburn, cheers!
* sonney2k takes a sip
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you prepared your sausages?
 blackburn	I am powering off my nuclear station and sipping vodka
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure
@sonney2k	I've also switched to wearing lederhosen
 blackburn	sonney2k: well my shapka uschanka is in place
 n4nd0	I have my wine next to me too :D
-!- alexlovesdata [55b21f10@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.178.31.16] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmm we need something stereotypical about you too
 blackburn	hey there alex that loves data
 alexlovesdata	hey blackburn
 alexlovesdata	I am only in webchat
 alexlovesdata	too stupid to get empathy running on ubuntu
 n4nd0	blackburn: mmm I can be a bullfigther if you want
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes bad boy I want it
 n4nd0	lol
 blackburn	alexlovesdata: install pidgin! :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, you sure you have two horns?
 n4nd0	haha I hope not, otherwise I will seriously talk to my gf
@sonney2k	I think that is *the* acceptance criterion for a bull
-!- cwidmer [4a49bc61@gateway/web/freenode/ip.74.73.188.97] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you feel horny?
 cwidmer	hi guys
 blackburn	and the mighty christian klaus!
@sonney2k	n4nd0, more like bullying maybe *SCNR*
@sonney2k	hi cwidmer!
@sonney2k	where is heiko?
 cwidmer	"do you feel horny?" what's going on here, your minds in the gutter again ;)?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: :D
 blackburn	it happens, cwidmer :(
 cwidmer	haha
-!- alexlovesdata [55b21f10@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.178.31.16] has quit [Client Quit]
@sonney2k	cwidmer, n4nd0 suggested a new nick bullfighter
@sonney2k	cwidmer, so I started a discussion about #horns
 cwidmer	haha, alright
-!- alexlovesdata1 [~binder@e178031016.adsl.alicedsl.de] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	or better one missing... thats how it goes here
 blackburn	sonney2k: you don't have to be sorry
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	let me email heiko
 blackburn	and explain my bad behavior
@sonney2k	hei"the brain"ko
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0, alexlovesdata1, cwidmer - could you use your shogun-toolbox.org addresses when posting on the mailinglist?
 n4nd0	sure, I forgot that I have one
 blackburn	sure but forgive me if I forget to set right mail
 cwidmer	phew, I'll take a look
 cwidmer	too many email addresses already
 cwidmer	mpg, tu-berlin, two at msk
 cwidmer	but should be ok
 cwidmer	at least this one will stick around for a while
 blackburn	FOR EVER
 cwidmer	not like mpg which deletes our account not long after you leave
 cwidmer	hehe
@sonney2k	it helps people to realize who is wildly guessing :)
@sonney2k	cwidmer, as long as the domain exists it will be there
 cwidmer	fair enough
 alexlovesdata1	will do
@sonney2k	anyway heiko has vanished... no idea where he is
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, do you still have technical problems doing so?
 alexlovesdata1	for sending email as shogun-toolbox.org? have'nt tried yet
 alexlovesdata1	will try now
 alexlovesdata1	via my tu-berlin account
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	multiple emails is a pure evil
@sonney2k	so about the workshop - I assume everybody here will come right?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have ~100 addresses...
 blackburn	what?
 blackburn	100?
@sonney2k	lower bound :D
 cwidmer	I'll come if I'm in Germany, but that's the current plan
 cwidmer	will know for sure in a few months
 alexlovesdata1	for me the same as for cwidmer
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I guess gunnar will be there too - others of mkcc?
 alexlovesdata1	intend to come
 blackburn	I'll come if I am not killed by a bus
 cwidmer	maybe marius will come, not sure if he's attending ismb
@sonney2k	we need to somehow get some headcount
 cwidmer	might be a good idea for him to get into bio
 n4nd0	I will come!
@sonney2k	cwidmer, poor marius
 cwidmer	Iol
 cwidmer	it'll take time
 cwidmer	fun to have him around, though
 cwidmer	anyway, I could imagine that philipp and andre might want to come
 cwidmer	but only if they are at ISMB anyway
 cwidmer	don't think any of the new students will make it this year, but who knows
@sonney2k	cwidmer, ok
 alexlovesdata1	@sonney2k: email via shogun-toolbox.org as a second identity or does it have a mailserver on it?
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, second identity only
@sonney2k	so to get an estimate of the headcount - what do we do?
@sonney2k	I mean not that we are just 10 people but ask for c-base mainhall which could easily fit 80
 cwidmer	so everyone except alex and I here will come for sure?
@sonney2k	my thoughts on this a) set up some submission form on shogun-toolbox.org
 cwidmer	I mean, we haven't started seriously advertising yet, the number could go up, depending on the "progam"
@sonney2k	b) simple write email to register - which would need somebody (not me) to take care of the people
 blackburn	google docs forms should help here
 alexlovesdata1	what means to take care = have a spreadsheet of participants?
 blackburn	I can manage this list
 cwidmer	blackburn, that should do
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, that and send a - thanks email and answer all the questions to come
 cwidmer	just a simple sheet with a form front-end
 alexlovesdata1	answer silly questions about berlin i can do
 blackburn	I will have a lot of silly questions about berlin
 cwidmer	just send everyone to berghain
 alexlovesdata1	your telephone lady Alex is patient :)
@sonney2k	so alexlovesdata1, blackburn - we generate some mailinglist sth like workshop@shogun-toolbox.org
 blackburn	right
@sonney2k	register everyone here and you take care of saying thanks?
 alexlovesdata1	ok
@sonney2k	and answer questions right?
 alexlovesdata1	ok
 blackburn	hmm wait
@sonney2k	issue of course is that this mailinglist will be public and we will get spam
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	I think thanks should be in personal
 alexlovesdata1	cant be worse than the gsoc mentors list
 alexlovesdata1	maybe we should make clear that we cannot provide invitation letters to visa
 blackburn	haha yes
 blackburn	I'd need one
 alexlovesdata1	this happens for some low-fee conferences
 alexlovesdata1	you are exceptional :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, what I mean is - they write an email to workshop@ ... and you reply CC'ing workshop@
 blackburn	so I'll go as a tourist :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah okay right
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, why can we not provide invitation letters for visa?
 blackburn	sonney2k: can you provide such letters?
@sonney2k	I've done this for one of the workshop's I was organizing
@sonney2k	it is just some email
 blackburn	it is really relevant for me :D
 alexlovesdata1	for blackburn it is ok
 blackburn	as I am located in the third world country
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is some draft for e.g. google mentor summit on the gsoc site
 alexlovesdata1	but you will get people from non-eu countries ask for an invitation letter ... I am not sure who is responsible if they do not take the flight back (!)
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	haha that's funny
 alexlovesdata1	no, just a second-world democracy :D
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: oh democracy, I have seen that word somewhere before :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, we don't even have that word in germany :P
 blackburn	sonney2k: good old song of sonney2k
@sonney2k	blackburn, so fine with that?
 blackburn	blackburn: with what?
@sonney2k	registration
 cwidmer	sonney2k, so have you guys decided on the format yet? I guess there will be some tutorials etc? hackathons? unconference?
 blackburn	workshop@ ?
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	yes I like that
@sonney2k	cwidmer, please take over the lead brb
 alexlovesdata1	the point is sonne, I have invited people personally already, and I know that I would be personally liable with abschiebekosten if they do not return ...
 blackburn	cwidmer: that's next on the list I guess
 cwidmer	ok
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: abschiebekosten?
 cwidmer	well first of all, it'll be a two day thing, correct?
 blackburn	that sounds like you was set on fire
 blackburn	or killed with an axe
 cwidmer	we could set up a list of proposals for tutorials
 cwidmer	I'm willing to talk about some of my stuff, either Multitask stuff or sequence analysis
 cwidmer	share some code
 cwidmer	we could also collect proposals for hackathons
 cwidmer	who else would be willing to give a talk, blackburn?
 blackburn	cwidmer: I am willing to talk for sure
 blackburn	if you get my russian accent
 blackburn	:D
 cwidmer	sure, it'll just be more convincing that you know what you're talking about
 cwidmer	;)
 n4nd0	I would like to talk too! I could maybe present the SO framework
 cwidmer	that'd be awesome!
 blackburn	well I can talk about dimensionality reduction, SURPRISED? :D
 alexlovesdata1	do we have a talk about code structures in general?
 cwidmer	it has it's place btw
@sonney2k	cwidmer, one day!
 cwidmer	http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html
 cwidmer	see? ;)
 alexlovesdata1	something like: adding some functionality tutorial / or something on the implicite code styles imposed by sonne on us ;)
 cwidmer	under 'just looking' and 'pca doesn't work' ;)
-!- heiko2 [~heiko@dab-bhx2-h-3-9.dab.02.net] has joined #shogun
 heiko2	Hi all
 blackburn	so here heiko2 comes
 cwidmer	hi heiko
 heiko2	Very sorry for the delay, I was stuck in the London tube without any signal
 blackburn	haha
 cwidmer	sonney2k, so it's two days?
 n4nd0	hello heiko2
 heiko2	*reading channel logs*
 blackburn	cwidmer: I am afraid one
 cwidmer	yikes
 cwidmer	that's dense
 alexlovesdata1	suggestion: if there are much more talks and weather is promising we can have a talk sit-in in a park
 cwidmer	should we make an optional second one for hackathons and internal discussion?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, *ONE* day
 alexlovesdata1	we just need a sufficiently strong beamer for that
 cwidmer	good idea
 cwidmer	tempelhof ;)
 alexlovesdata1	that would be an unofifcial 2nd day ;)
 alexlovesdata1	could be
 blackburn	in sonney2k's flat
 n4nd0	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, you could camp in the garden :)
 cwidmer	is there a room at TU we could use for this?
 cwidmer	in the fancy new building?
@sonney2k	^ alexlovesdata1
 cwidmer	or even the old one ;)
 blackburn	we can party in the old broken TU
 blackburn	:D
 alexlovesdata1	for the 2nd day?
@sonney2k	yes
 cwidmer	yes
 cwidmer	2nd day
 heiko2	sonney2k, the logs only go until 2015, did anything else happen in these 15 minutes? :)
 alexlovesdata1	I could try to find out
@sonney2k	that would be saturday though
 alexlovesdata1	will find out about this
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, please do
 cwidmer	ok, great
 cwidmer	now for the main event - what do you have in mind?
 cwidmer	mainly tutorials?
 cwidmer	wake up :P
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I am totally open
 n4nd0	cwidmer: what other ideas could be?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, heiko2, wiking_, your opinons
 cwidmer	panel discussion
 alexlovesdata1	in the evening something party like for networking ??
 cwidmer	big data blah, the next big thing in ML, the future of shogun
 cwidmer	yes
 cwidmer	that's critical
 heiko2	I would say tutorials should be in there
@sonney2k	(workshop's I've organized where usually like talk talks poster / (panel) discussion - lots of breaks)
 cwidmer	we have to have a nice evening event
@sonney2k	maybe we can do some grill event in the evening
@sonney2k	when the weather is nice
 alexlovesdata1	tutorials + a break for a poster session?
 cwidmer	will they kick us out at some time or do we have cbase all night?
 blackburn	cwidmer: I'd like to present my vision of future of shogun with some discussion
 heiko2	barbecue is a very nice idea :)
@sonney2k	cwidmer, we have c-base (not exclusively) from 11-19hrs
 cwidmer	yes
@sonney2k	it is berlin summer, c-base is at river spree
@sonney2k	so we could do something outside
 cwidmer	sounds great
@sonney2k	but there will of course be others lurking around :)
 cwidmer	we should have a plan B though
 blackburn	get drunk
 blackburn	that's B
 blackburn	:D
 cwidmer	no, that's part of plans A-Z
 cwidmer	questions is where
 alexlovesdata1	so we need tutorials+ poster session with break + panel discussion + a park grill in the evning?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, exactly
 heiko2	poster sessions?
 heiko2	which posters?`_=
 heiko2	:)
 cwidmer	not sure about posters
@sonney2k	one more question - how serious do we want this event to be?
@sonney2k	heiko2, about certain algorithms we have in shogun
@sonney2k	gory details
@sonney2k	we don't have to...
 alexlovesdata1	people may want to talk about their scientific work with the posters??
 cwidmer	how about a session where people pitch questions to the shogun/guest audience and get some feedback how they could approach their problem... this only works if there are "practitioners" in the audience
 alexlovesdata1	as a posotive side effect?
@sonney2k	brb
 n4nd0	cwidmer: I think that is a good idea
 heiko2	sonney2k, I think the question is how many people from "outside" will come, so if most people are well known, it doesnt have to be superserious, if others are joining a more serious setting could be usefull
 n4nd0	something more oriented to the people coming to visit to affect shogun with their suggestions and ideas
 cwidmer	I guess this depends on the kind of people that sign up for this, if it's ML scientists like most of us or people using shogun as a technology
 heiko2	maybe a good mix is a good idea
 heiko2	so there could be some technical tutorials
 cwidmer	yes, we should definitely keep a list of ideas and have people do some voting before
 cwidmer	yes
 heiko2	how to install /external dependencies etc
 heiko2	maybe we should come up with a list here and put this online for voting
 heiko2	good idea
 cwidmer	I really like the SO tutorial idea, also blackburn could give a nice tutorial on either dim-reduct or L1-MTL
 blackburn	yeah
 heiko2	An introduction on how to hack shogun would also be cool to cast new developers
 heiko2	And I think some examples on how to use shogun for std tasks would be cool
 cwidmer	yes
 blackburn	yeah sure
 cwidmer	this would be a basic shogun tutorial
 cwidmer	something for our beloved dictator, maybe?
 cwidmer	;)
 heiko2	I know many people that are afraid of using shogun because it is complicated
 cwidmer	I set up this doc to collect ideas
 cwidmer	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gxetahar27rkcgE5cdUjdtK49ulwXsfZ9FStGJXyBVw/edit
 alexlovesdata1	can we do a talk about successful applications of shogun? do we have some material about works where shogun was used for excellent something?
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	well
 heiko2	Classifier evaluation tutorial would also be cool (x-validation, gradient descent on error functions ...)
 blackburn	heiko2: that sounds like something for you
 heiko2	blackburn, yes maybe
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I hereby declare you to be the program committee
 cwidmer	done
 heiko2	hacking shogun (create new classes, what tools exist, how to create new interfaces... )
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you want to talk about how do you see future of shogun?
 heiko2	anybody knows how many non-German people will come?
@sonney2k	blackburn, maybe in a panel discussion with other topics?
@sonney2k	heiko2, no
@sonney2k	heiko2, we don't know who / how many will come
 blackburn	we should avoid german or I don't get a word :D
@sonney2k	heiko2, we first need some kind of program / plan
 heiko2	so I guess english will be the language :)
@sonney2k	sure
 n4nd0	yeah same here about German hehe
 alexlovesdata1	is the date close to some mach learn/computvis/datamining/bioscience conferemce?
 heiko2	I always love it when a group of German people is talking english to each other with these massicve German accent :)
@sonney2k	German is stupid anyways
 heiko2	what?
@sonney2k	anyway, do we want external submissions
@sonney2k	as in talks / posters / whatever from others?
 cwidmer	alexlovesdata1, there is ISMB
 heiko2	it would be ultra cool to have some people that use shogun for science and talk about it
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	is there any?
 blackburn	:D
-!- zxtx [~zv@96-40-100-175.static.bbcy.ca.charter.com] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	like call for talks / contributions / or even some special issue in some journal...
 alexlovesdata1	talks+poster should be peer-reviewed
 alexlovesdata1	at least the talks
 cwidmer	heiko2, shogun is very commonly used for bioological sequence analysis
 alexlovesdata1	in the sense that we can check whether it makes sense ... ever reviewed non-sense submissions to ml conferences?
 heiko2	cwidmer, yeah, so this would be cool to have explained by somebody
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, some voting among us should be sufficient
 alexlovesdata1	@sonne agree
 heiko2	on what should we have this public vote?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, heiko2 - we should actually found some shogun e.V. at this event!
 heiko2	maybe on the algorithms inside shogun introduced?
 heiko2	sonney2k, great idea!
 blackburn	what is e.V.?
@sonney2k	blackburn, shogun foundation
 blackburn	what is it for?
 alexlovesdata1	e.V. = eingetragener Verein
 heiko2	we are enough people
@sonney2k	blackburn, to act as entity
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: oh you helped me a lot :D
 alexlovesdata1	non-profit foundation by german law
 blackburn	eingetragener Verein is much more digestable for me :D
 heiko2	blackburn, to gain tax saving for example
@sonney2k	e.g. shogun foundation could get money / pay tax etc
 alexlovesdata1	i helped you to google for it, blackburn ;)
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: jk
@sonney2k	so how does the program look like
@sonney2k	cwidmer, ^
 heiko2	cwidmer, if many biology people coming, I could introduce the statistical hypothesis testing framework, thats something for high-throughput data
 cwidmer	sounds good
 cwidmer	so when do we start?
 cwidmer	what time
@sonney2k	11-19
 cwidmer	hmm, how about lunch
 cwidmer	order pizza?
 heiko2	BBQ!
 cwidmer	in the evening, right?
 n4nd0	BBQ is more evening oriented
 n4nd0	yeah
 heiko2	well ok
 cwidmer	we need food for lunch to fuel us for all that ML
 n4nd0	pizza would be fine I think
 heiko2	Is the c-base in an area where there is a lot of street food?
 cwidmer	shouldn't be the first time people order pizza to cbase
 alexlovesdata1	pizza = how stereotypical ;)
 heiko2	cwidmer haha :)
 cwidmer	haha
@sonney2k	heiko2, not a lot but it is close to alexanderplatz
@sonney2k	like one train station away
@sonney2k	so should not be an issue
 cwidmer	I think it's better to have food there
 cwidmer	otherwise it'll take too much time
 heiko2	sonney2k, so not mnuch travelling for good lunch, then we could just organise a pizza order and everyone who is not into stereotypes just eats out
@sonney2k	ordering pizza would work sure
 cwidmer	maybe we could have a 30min window to start eating and then merge this into the panel discussion
 n4nd0	good idea
@sonney2k	1 hour break
@sonney2k	and no session above 1:30 w/o break
 blackburn	in other way we get dead men
 blackburn	:D
 heiko2	or even only 1h
 heiko2	since there is so much stuff
 blackburn	that's going to be quite dense
 cwidmer	so at cbase, it's safe to assume that there will be space for everyone to set up their laptop, right?
 heiko2	oh, what about our tutorial project?
 blackburn	heiko2: 2nd day?
 heiko2	We should do something with that!
 alexlovesdata1	the question is rather: what happens to the w-lan if 100 people go online with laptop + smartphone
 blackburn	or third?
 alexlovesdata1	some conferences crumble under that load
@sonney2k	cwidmer, wireless powerplugs are a non-issue
 cwidmer	so who ever wanted to could to some ipython notebook style tutorial to code along
 cwidmer	sonne2k more concerned about tables
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, 100 people is certainly an upper limit :)
@sonney2k	cwidmer, also a non issue
@sonney2k	not exactly that comfortable but will work
 cwidmer	good, that answers my question :)
 cwidmer	ok, so what is a good time slot for tutorials?
 cwidmer	min 30min, I'd say
 cwidmer	max 1hr
 heiko2	agreed
 cwidmer	maybe something like 45min including discussion?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, tutorials are usually first / early
 cwidmer	so we do two tutorials and then coffee break
@sonney2k	cwidmer, or one in the morning one after lunch
@sonney2k	cwidmer, since I assume we have no keynotes right?
 cwidmer	well
@sonney2k	cwidmer, or does gunnar want to talk about sth like ML in general?
 cwidmer	should we try to invite speakers?
 cwidmer	I think he wouldn't mind
@sonney2k	cwidmer, we could have *one* very broad ML talk
 cwidmer	feel like doing that?
@sonney2k	to show off what one can do
 cwidmer	we could ask Gunnar for sure
 alexlovesdata1	better talks about future and specific applications fields ?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, gunnar did this lots of times and he is good in doing this
 cwidmer	yes
 heiko2	sonney2k cwidmer, he also might attract more people to come since well-known
@sonney2k	cwidmer, alright so some tutorial I (someone willing to co-do this cwidmer you?) should give and gunnar some ML overview
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I think we should have some call for contributions
@sonney2k	I mean some scientists might not be allowed to go w/o presenting
 cwidmer	sure, I'm willing to help out
 cwidmer	good point
 heiko2	sonney2k, this would be cool, I could even advertise this here at UCL - they have big travel funds
 cwidmer	however, keep in mind that there is a chance I'll be stuck in the US for some reason
 alexlovesdata1	so there we are back for the question about invited talks and a poster session?
 cwidmer	I think this is a strong argument for posters
 alexlovesdata1	I mean invited talks could be held by people who are somewhat higher ranked
 cwidmer	why don't we just combine the poster session with the (beginning of) the social event
 alexlovesdata1	and can talk even about general ML without saying blabla like gunnar
 n4nd0	I can say it also around here at KTH, I know at least a postdoc who has used shogun for his research in robotics
 alexlovesdata1	and posters for the others?
 alexlovesdata1	the poster session can be also at  the end of the lunch break
 alexlovesdata1	to avoid losses from food seekers getting lost in Berlin
 alexlovesdata1	alternative: in a longer afternoon break (30-45 minutes?)
 cwidmer	both possible
 cwidmer	I would probably vote for combining lunch with panel discussion and posters with drinking
 cwidmer	:)
 cwidmer	keeps discussions vivid
 alexlovesdata1	also a good idea ;)
 blackburn	I can post something about this event at biggest russian ML website
 blackburn	does that make sense?
 n4nd0	lunch with panel discussion sounds like a good idea
@sonney2k	once we have some program ready we should send out a call for contributions / announcement to all relevant places
@sonney2k	n4nd0, hmmh I don't know. can you talk while eating?
@sonney2k	panelists will starve...
 heiko2	good point, maybe only half overlapping
 cwidmer	ah, btw
 cwidmer	we could try to have companies sponsor lunch, drinks and dinner
 cwidmer	not sure if ccc will kick us out then
 cwidmer	;)
 blackburn	companies like?
 blackburn	microsoft? :D
 alexlovesdata1	the german secret service (BND) :D
 cwidmer	google, ms, amazon
 cwidmer	amazon would be good
 cwidmer	considering they are starting big in berlin
 blackburn	yeah it could become something special
 n4nd0	sonney2k: like the idea that cwidmer said before, half an hour for lunch and later we start the panel, people can continue eating pizza then if they want so
 heiko2	cwidmer I like the idea of having these companies involved
 heiko2	shogun gets more attention by them this way
 cwidmer	sonney2k
@sonney2k	brb
 cwidmer	how about tomtom?
 blackburn	google knows us
 blackburn	hah tomtom
 cwidmer	I'm pretty sure we get google funding for some pizza or something, maybe even a best poster price
 alexlovesdata1	SAP?
 cwidmer	sure
 alexlovesdata1	best poster price sounds good!
 heiko2	not sap!
 heiko2	they did a workshop at UCL a while ago and this stuff sucks so much
 cwidmer	heh
 heiko2	oh wait, this was SAS :)
 alexlovesdata1	I mean the idea of getting companies in it is that they might carry away some developers?
 blackburn	hah sas sap what's the difference, right heiko2?
 alexlovesdata1	four girls carry away blackburn ;)
 heiko2	blackburn, hehe :)
 heiko2	blackburn, I meant the data guys
 blackburn	I am afraid I will be with my gf :D
 alexlovesdata1	if you drink she might quadruplicate ;)
 heiko2	had one of them present sas at UCL, and the guy had no idea about anything, and the code editor was in comic-sans
 blackburn	oh that's the good shot alexlovesdata1
 blackburn	heiko2: haha lol
 blackburn	heiko2: no idea about anything? what did he present?
 heiko2	blackburn, didnt you once tell me you explained SVM to your girl? :)
 blackburn	heiko2: she knows svms
 heiko2	blackburn, klicking buttons
 blackburn	heiko2: her thesis was about multiclass svms :D
 heiko2	blackburn, well then she is welcome :)
 heiko2	blackburn, wow :)
 blackburn	some comparison but she knows something about that
 heiko2	you should have her programing for shogun
 heiko2	she could join with sonney2k's kids :)
 blackburn	I could encourage her becoming gsoc student but this could be unfair
 blackburn	sounds like corrupcy :D
 n4nd0	y?
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn	corruption?
 blackburn	the second word is better I guess
 blackburn	or 'the thing that happen in russia everywhere' may be?
 blackburn	:D
 alexlovesdata1	maybe we should catch all the ideas off this chat logs on Monday?
 alexlovesdata1	my gf went to bed sleeping is a seemingly pissing mood :|
 blackburn	that could mean you should go too :D
 alexlovesdata1	yes ... :(
 alexlovesdata1	nerd: programming instead of copul...
 cwidmer	ok, there is a prelimiary schedule in the google doc
 cwidmer	I think it's a bit too passive at the momemt
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	but it compresses some ideas
 cwidmer	I'm thinking we should add some unconference-style session in between
 cwidmer	question is how we decide on this
 blackburn	dance benchmark
 cwidmer	the voting should take place before the meeting
 blackburn	benchmark sounds like ML
 cwidmer	otherwise it'll take up too much time
 alexlovesdata1	hack in for detecting sad vs happy faces from participants taken via cam?
 cwidmer	sonney2k, are there small rooms available like at GSoC mentor summit?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: and this sounds like opencv
 heiko2	cwidmer, we could have a challenge for the participants
 heiko2	like: here is a dataset, use shogun to get good results
-!- zxtx [~zv@96-40-100-175.static.bbcy.ca.charter.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 heiko2	have a price paid by tomtom
 cwidmer	yeah, good idea
 blackburn	haha tomtom doesn't know they have to pay for that yet !
 blackburn	:D
 cwidmer	and we could release this upfront
 cwidmer	and have the winner give a talk
 heiko2	sonney2k, will tell them :)
 cwidmer	but
 heiko2	cwidmer, thats also cool
 cwidmer	someone will need to organize something interesting
@sonney2k	cwidmer, well c-base is a starship
 cwidmer	that takes time
 alexlovesdata1	a poster price is more attractive for the majority I guess
 heiko2	But also thought of how to get things a bit more interactive
@sonney2k	one seminar room / one main hall
 heiko2	maybe we could have just an hour where everyone can ask developers questions or something like this
@sonney2k	but we get the main hall only if we have lots of participants
@sonney2k	say ~50
 cwidmer	ah only two rooms
 cwidmer	hmm
 cwidmer	well, if the weather is nice, two sessions could go outside
@sonney2k	cwidmer, actually I would love to hear about any applications of shogun to real world problems...
@sonney2k	cwidmer, do you plan for 500+ people/
@sonney2k	?
 cwidmer	yeah, that could go into the applications slot
 cwidmer	nah
 cwidmer	unconference
 cwidmer	gsoc mentor summit style, but only a small session
 cwidmer	for example
@sonney2k	cwidmer, handshaking event?
 cwidmer	just to get people to talk more and listen less
 cwidmer	hahaha
 cwidmer	no.
 heiko2	cwidmer, what do you mean gsoc mentor summit style?
 cwidmer	;)
 cwidmer	well, why not, but you need to organize
 cwidmer	I would feel silly
 alexlovesdata1	for that we have poster session + evening event??
 cwidmer	unconference style: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference
 heiko2	sonney2k, cwidmer, what about an academic speed-dating, like everyone shakes hand of everyone and introduces oneself in 2 mins?
 blackburn	hahah
 heiko2	this way, everybody would at least talk once to everybody
 heiko2	else
@sonney2k	cwidmer, looking at the schedule
@sonney2k	I somehow think the panel discussion should be at the end
 cwidmer	maybe we could start the unconference proposals upfront (via mailing list) and continue in coffee breaks
 n4nd0	it sounds funny this academic speed-dating :D but it could turn out to be nice
 heiko2	n4nd0, I did this quite a few times and it always was nice
@sonney2k	heiko2, I like this a lot?
@sonney2k	heiko2, when is this usually done?
 heiko2	alway got some emails afterwards:  "hey you were the guy doing XYZ which I found interested"
 heiko2	sonney2k, in the beginning after introduction
 heiko2	even got one little project out of this
 heiko2	clustering bird sounds from a biologist with MMD :)
 blackburn	doesn't that require 2*(N(N-1)/2) minutes?
 cwidmer	haha lol
 cwidmer	shake hands would be the 10sec variant of that
 heiko2	blackburn, the way its usually done is via two circles of people, and the outer one rotates
 cwidmer	which we did at gsoc, which turned out to be fun
 heiko2	no introducing oneself is the point
 heiko2	and one can stop after 30 mins, since its exhausting
 heiko2	but you meet 75% of the people
@sonney2k	cwidmer, can you put the schedule as a post under http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/workshop2013 once we are done and send out an email to the mailinglist to open it for discussion?
 heiko2	sonney2k, cwidmer, blackburn, I think we should in general get people talking to each other, this lots of positive effects. And usually ML nerds dont talk to much to each other :)
@sonney2k	heiko2, full ack
 blackburn	agree
 cwidmer	sonney2k, sure, have to check how to post there though
@sonney2k	I like the speeddating thing
 heiko2	we could also make some groups of people use shogun on the spot to solve some easy problem
 blackburn	I think I will talk a lot after two vodkas
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	lets do it at the beginning!
 cwidmer	heiko2 yes, true
 heiko2	so that people actually work together
 heiko2	at least a bit
@sonney2k	and then I would want gunnar to give a general ML intro
 heiko2	blackburn, but some people might be scared by a drunk Russian :D
@sonney2k	and then some user contributed talks
 cwidmer	that's why we need sponsored cocktails as social catalyser
@sonney2k	and then break and then maybe shogun tutorial
@sonney2k	and then user contributed / turial but panel discussions at the *end*
 cwidmer	feel free to shuffle sessions around, its at the bottom of the document
 cwidmer	however, I think tutorials should be longer than 15min
 cwidmer	you can say close to nothing in 15min
@sonney2k	cwidmer, sure
@sonney2k	no < 15 minutes stuff
 alexlovesdata1	tutorials should be 30-45 minutes
 heiko2	maybe even the 15 should be 20
@sonney2k	if we have posters spotlight session
 alexlovesdata1	maybe application stories in 15-30 minutes?
 cwidmer	I would like to alternate between interactive and passive
 cwidmer	alex, sounds reasonable
@sonney2k	guys, our mailinglist has 234 subscribers (nice number btw :)
@sonney2k	so lets say we have 10 times more users
@sonney2k	1-2% come + some outsiders
 blackburn	wow that's math
@sonney2k	so ~50 participants?
 blackburn	haha we knew the answer
 heiko2	sonney2k, I think that is a bit too optimistic
 cwidmer	I think so, too
 cwidmer	depends on our advertising, though
@sonney2k	heiko2, cwidmer what is your guess?
 cwidmer	I would guess, core devs plus 30
@sonney2k	heiko2, for example a couple of people from berlin uni's will come
 heiko2	30+-
 heiko2	same
 cwidmer	but if all of us post to our university mailing lists etc
 heiko2	sonney2k, that would be cool
@sonney2k	cwidmer, core devs + 30?
 cwidmer	we can push this up
@sonney2k	so ~40
 cwidmer	no idea, really
 cwidmer	hard to tell
 blackburn	who added GPs?
 blackburn	:D
 heiko2	me :)
 blackburn	there is no one to talk about GPs
 blackburn	:D
 cwidmer	maybe even part of the CCC crowd will come
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I know of one
@sonney2k	already
 heiko2	I could do this if somebody is ound
 heiko2	currently using them for work
 blackburn	sure
 heiko2	and there are more
 heiko2	GPs is something that would be very cool to extend in order to get more statisticians on boards
 heiko2	especially once the R-bindings are working
 cwidmer	I think oli stegle will be at ISMB
@sonney2k	cwidmer, you said you wanted alternating passive/active?
 cwidmer	we can ask if he's willing to contribute tutorial
 cwidmer	yes
 blackburn	heiko2: I think I should ask you a few questions about GPs later
@sonney2k	but what active do we have except panel discussion?
 cwidmer	to postpone the passing out of people
 cwidmer	well, the unconference session
 cwidmer	could be one
 heiko2	blackburn, sure, if you are not asking for "how to make them fast"
 cwidmer	and poster session
 blackburn	heiko2: hah but predictions are fast, aren't they?
@sonney2k	panel discussion / poster session are sth people like to skip
 cwidmer	not if there is food
 cwidmer	:P
 cwidmer	let me correct
 heiko2	blackburn, depends
 cwidmer	free food
@sonney2k	or... there is sth going on
 blackburn	good point about food :D
 blackburn	may be we even get some homeless
 heiko2	if you do Bayesian hyperparameters than not, but lets postpone this
 blackburn	because of that
@sonney2k	like some big shot giving a talk directly before
 cwidmer	are there foosball tables?
@sonney2k	nope
 cwidmer	the blackburn lookalike contenst should do
@sonney2k	cwidmer, yeah sure
 blackburn	who is that fan of me who added this?
@sonney2k	I guess this is an easy win
@sonney2k	just bring your bear and vodka
 heiko2	blackburn, I am the fan :)
 cwidmer	ok, what's the verdict?
 cwidmer	sonney2k, feel free to shuffle around the program
 cwidmer	as far as I'm concerned it's a good start
@sonney2k	cwidmer, shuffling
 cwidmer	note that the actual times are all the way down
 alexlovesdata1	blackburn: don't homeless taste like old meat??
 cwidmer	ah
 cwidmer	saw the new page
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1: I am scared
 blackburn	have you ever taste homeless?
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	I got it
 blackburn	:D
 cwidmer	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Geeking
 cwidmer	;)
 cwidmer	as if a ml meeting wasn't nerdy enough already
 blackburn	hah
 n4nd0	:D
 heiko2	hehe
 alexlovesdata1	anythinh organizational to be discussed yet?
 blackburn	yeah - do we have anything still?
 blackburn	alexlovesdata1's girl is waiting
 n4nd0	hehe nothing that I can think of
 n4nd0	we should probably organize some of the ideas mentioned
@sonney2k	cwidmer, what is that unconference thing?
 cwidmer	well, gsoc style smaller meetings
@sonney2k	you want to have spontaneous discussions?
 cwidmer	e.g. R-users shogun
 cwidmer	or bio users
@sonney2k	cwidmer, but in smaller groups?
 cwidmer	or industry applications
 cwidmer	or whatever
 cwidmer	yes
@sonney2k	so people should grab a coffee an meet in one corner etc?
 cwidmer	yes
@sonney2k	alright makes sense - shouldn't be unconference style but we need some vote for subjects
@sonney2k	30 mins right?
 cwidmer	we could people have propose meetings upfront
 cwidmer	and we put up whiteboards with topics on it
 cwidmer	and people are asked to vote
 cwidmer	and top scoring topics will be held
 cwidmer	quite liked it at gsoc
 cwidmer	and its easier for us as we are fewer
 blackburn	I like that more than dating
 cwidmer	could be 2x30 min
-!- heiko2 [~heiko@dab-bhx2-h-3-9.dab.02.net] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
 cwidmer	blackburn, same here
 blackburn	most of people can get shy
 blackburn	or so
 blackburn	and it takes a lot of time
 cwidmer	I mean anyone can shake hands, but it takes time
 cwidmer	ok guys, is there anything left to discuss?
@sonney2k	I think the speed dating is *very* helpful
@sonney2k	from gsoc
@sonney2k	cwidmer, yeah we need some plan how to proceed
@sonney2k	when to meet next for this
@sonney2k	and who does what by then
 cwidmer	alright
 blackburn	let me prepare the form
 cwidmer	so have we finalized the program?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, not at all :/
 cwidmer	how shall we proceed?
@sonney2k	we cannot have poster session overlapping with bbq
 cwidmer	why?
@sonney2k	or we have to start bbq at 18 hrs already
@sonney2k	I reserved from 11-19hrs
 cwidmer	hmm
@sonney2k	so there might be sth else going on inside of c-base
 cwidmer	any way to reserve longer?
@sonney2k	one important date
@sonney2k	I will present our 'program' to the c-base circle meeting on feb 1st
@sonney2k	cwidmer, maybe
@sonney2k	but we need to have it 'ready' for that
 cwidmer	ok, how about we clarify our actual time constraints and then fix the final program
 cwidmer	and we meet again in exactly a week from now
 cwidmer	feb 2nd?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, I think we should have poster sessions in all breaks
@sonney2k	aka everyone can put up posters in the beginning
@sonney2k	and then when there are breaks
@sonney2k	people can discuss and go to posters
 cwidmer	sure, maybe people can leave their posters up
@sonney2k	so we do a bit more breaks
 cwidmer	sure, sounds good
@sonney2k	k
 cwidmer	but it's also nice to kick off the sociel event at night
 cwidmer	gets people talking
 cwidmer	I think everyone else has passed out
 cwidmer	blackburn, wake up!
 blackburn	cwidmer: hah
 blackburn	I am not asleep
 cwidmer	where am I
 cwidmer	sonney2k, should we then meet again on feb2nd for finalizing the structure?
 blackburn	I am a little lost already
 blackburn	should think about my ideas
 blackburn	if I ever had any
 cwidmer	I like the lookalike contenst
@sonney2k	cwidmer, blackburn look at the new program
 cwidmer	should be fun
 cwidmer	;)
@sonney2k	I think it is quite OK now
 blackburn	sonney2k: last page?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	saying new program or sth
 blackburn	looks ok for me
 blackburn	but quite dense
 cwidmer	works for me
@sonney2k	not too dense actually
@sonney2k	lots of breaks / fun events
@sonney2k	but we can reduce user contributed talks
@sonney2k	and have a longer break or longer user contrib talks
 cwidmer	sounds good
@sonney2k	alright so much about the program
@sonney2k	we could use gsoc money for travel support / food
 cwidmer	ok, sounds good
@sonney2k	so then last topic is who does what?
@sonney2k	and where is heiko?
 cwidmer	are there any volunteers to contact companies about sponsoring?
 blackburn	I expect sonney2k is the man :D
 blackburn	but I can try too
 cwidmer	heh, maybe not a bad idea
 cwidmer	maybe this needs some seniority
 blackburn	yes it does
@sonney2k	we need someone who updates the website with the current program proposal and posts this to the mailinglist
 blackburn	I don't have any
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok ok I am doing this
@sonney2k	the company / sponsoring stuff I mean
 n4nd0	I can update the website
@sonney2k	n4nd0, cool thanks!
 cwidmer	ok, I can write to the mailing list
 n4nd0	:)
 cwidmer	unless you just want to post the same stuff, then you can do it both in one go?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just create a new post but write *draft* of the program clearly :D
@sonney2k	so once that is done and I talked to the c-base people for real
 cwidmer	n4nd0, it's your call
@sonney2k	all that is left to do is the call for contributions/announcement email
 n4nd0	ok
@sonney2k	and then the real organization
@sonney2k	I mean bying food / ordering pizza / coffee right?
@sonney2k	and well volunteers to set up c-base in the morning for the event
 n4nd0	cwidmer: I can write it on the ml too ;)
 blackburn	so nothing for me :D
 cwidmer	n4nd0, ok thanks
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just tell cwidmer/me when you want a review of the post :)
 cwidmer	so who is setting up the workshop mailling list, sonney2k?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, yes :/
 cwidmer	ok
@sonney2k	but it is easy :D
 cwidmer	and blackburn will manage it
-!- heiko [~heiko@cpc23-camd13-2-0-cust121.hari.cable.virginmedia.com] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	good plan
@sonney2k	we don't have a task for heiko
@sonney2k	give it to him :D
 cwidmer	so will there be _TWO_ posts to the ml or one?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, one with the draft for now
 cwidmer	contributions/announcement email will be the same as prelimiary schedule, right?
@sonney2k	ahh heiko - could you write a call for contrib/announcement?
 cwidmer	ok
@sonney2k	cwidmer, no no
 cwidmer	ok, so there are two then
@sonney2k	cwidmer, just one draft to the mailinglist for now
@sonney2k	the real stuff will follow once everything is settled
 cwidmer	ok
 cwidmer	good
@sonney2k	heiko, ?
 cwidmer	so n4nd0 will set up the draft, sonney2k and I will review before it's send, ok
@sonney2k	cwidmer, oh btw we forgot about the shogun e.V. in the schedule
 n4nd0	yeah
@sonney2k	we need a slot for this
@sonney2k	30 mins likely
 cwidmer	what is it about?
 heiko	re
 cwidmer	discussion?
 cwidmer	shouldn't we do this on the second internal day?
 cwidmer	this is usually the part that external people really skip, as it has little relevance to them
 heiko	sonney2k, can do
@sonney2k	cwidmer, only issue is that I am not around the day after
 cwidmer	argh, that's too bad
 cwidmer	:(
@sonney2k	or we do it in the morning or evening before?
@sonney2k	I will be killed for that
 cwidmer	where's the fun in hackathons without sonney2k... shogun will be ported to boost without you knowing :P
 cwidmer	family obligations?
@sonney2k	cwidmer, directly before summer holidays
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	porting to boost !
 cwidmer	hmm
 cwidmer	should we all meet on the day before then?
 cwidmer	I don't know, we'll have to see
 cwidmer	who has time when
 heiko	I will be in Berlin the day before
 heiko	probably everybody who travels will be
@sonney2k	cwidmer, otherwise we do the shogun e.V. stuff at 10 am
 heiko	currently having diner so not having an eye on the chat all the time
 cwidmer	ok, that would work
 alexlovesdata1	my coconut tofu soup is ready :)
@sonney2k	alright so lets add this to the schedule?
 blackburn	I am ok to meet around 2 days
 blackburn	+- :)
 cwidmer	yeah, I think we should have an additional, possibly more internal but not exclusive day
 cwidmer	would be too bad if sonney2k couldn't attend
 alexlovesdata1	couldn't we prepare the founding of shogun e.V. ?
 alexlovesdata1	aka shogun toolbox e.V.
 alexlovesdata1	so that we have only little to discuss DURing the day?
 cwidmer	ok then
 cwidmer	anything left to discuss?
 n4nd0	don't think so
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, sure - but who can do that?
 n4nd0	I have to re-read what e.V. is again though hehe
@sonney2k	would be great if somebody could write up the 'Satzung'
 alexlovesdata1	ok writing a Satzung sounds a reasonable job for me ... but I would need to discuss by mail
@sonney2k	alexlovesdata1, heiko could you?
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	cool cool
@sonney2k	I think we are done then
 cwidmer	alexlovesdata1, sounds great
@sonney2k	we should meet after Feb 1st
@sonney2k	again
 cwidmer	ok, how about Feb 2nd
 cwidmer	same time?
@sonney2k	OK with me
 cwidmer	actually
@sonney2k	blackburn, n4nd0 ^
 cwidmer	feb 3rd would be better for me
 blackburn	works for me
 cwidmer	have a visitor on 2nd
 blackburn	any 1/2/3
@sonney2k	3rd then?
 n4nd0	3rd yeah
 n4nd0	2nd is bad for me
@sonney2k	heiko, ^
@sonney2k	3rd ok?
 n4nd0	I have something on the 3rd starting at 16:00 but I should be done by 21-22
@sonney2k	next meeting will be quick
@sonney2k	15-30mins
 cwidmer	ok sounds good, this was pretty productive
@sonney2k	alright everyone then
 cwidmer	looking forward to this workshop and to meeting some you guys in person
@sonney2k	thanks for the chat
@sonney2k	blackburn, vodka bottle empty?
@sonney2k	my beer is!
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes dead drunk already :)
@sonney2k	everyone cu around on the 3rd!
@sonney2k	blackburn, time to fix the bug then!
