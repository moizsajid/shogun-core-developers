 blackburn	sonne|work: I didn't get you :( how can I have mloss page with shogun code but with 'EDRT' label?
 sonne|work	you do EDRT label and point to your shogun subpage
 blackburn	sonne|work: but what about source?
 blackburn	and binaries
 blackburn	or so
 sonne|work	point to shogun
 blackburn	sonne|work: ok thanks, I thought it would be strange..

 blackburn	Ram108: hey how are you?
 Ram108	hey am fine
 Ram108	working on neural networks nw :)
 Ram108	hw r u? :)
 blackburn	fine
 blackburn	what do you do with NN?
 Ram108	classify....... working on backpropagation algorithm
 Ram108	fairly easy but slow
 blackburn	I see
 Ram108	hmmm :) i got a faint idea on hw real brain works nw
 Ram108	lol gona use that on my robot
 Ram108	built 1
 Ram108	 lol :P
 blackburn	Ram108: well that's exactly *not* how the brain works :)
 blackburn	too simplified..
 shogun-buildbot	build #273 of python_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_modular/builds/273
 Ram108	oh thats true :) this is a very crude representation
 blackburn	NN is very useful in OCR and visual pattern recognition though
 blackburn	Ram108: sorry I can't remember if you did something with MNIST dataset?
 Ram108	no that was the other guy
 blackburn	heh okay
 blackburn	then you could check MNIST page
 blackburn	http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
 Ram108	sure :) looking forward to it :)
 blackburn	best results are computed with convolution neural nets commitee
 Ram108	god this is huge!
 blackburn	with error of 0.27
 blackburn	just check results to compare methods
 Ram108	hmmm i ll try it out :) definitely with shoguns svm methods and the code which i am working on currently lol :P
 blackburn	but in other tasks NNs could act worse..
 Ram108	thanks a lot again........ well initially i was overwhelmed but now i seem to have a quaint idea of hw it works :)
 blackburn	nice
 Ram108	nn is slow and more often than necessary the code keeps running out of memory
 Ram108	thats 1 thing i have to fix
 Ram108	bye the way do u mind u could tell me abt urslf?
 blackburn	what exactly you want to know? :)
 blackburn	I guess we are of same age, I'm a student of Samara State Aerospace University in Samara, Russia
 Ram108	oh hmmm :)
 Ram108	nice :)
 blackburn	I'm also a software engineer @ netcracker
 Ram108	aerospace univ?
 Ram108	cool :)
 blackburn	last year I was a GSoC student, I did impelement 12 dimensionality reduction methods
 blackburn	and am still interested in nonlinear dimensionality reduction :)
 Ram108	yeah u told me that........ any chance i could try getting in? just asked
 blackburn	as GSoC student?
 Ram108	yeah
 blackburn	well if we get accepted
 blackburn	and if GSoC 2012 is announced :)
 blackburn	you definitely should try to some organization
 Ram108	well mostly shogun ll be right?
 blackburn	what do you mean?
 Ram108	as in ML is one of the frontier fields
 Ram108	so why wuldnt it?
 blackburn	I meant you can choose one organization you would like to work with
 Ram108	i guess am no1 to comment upon this.......
 Ram108	well i really want to learn this out
 Ram108	the thing is i was into robotics for so long..... and i got saturated with it. and i want to impart intelligence to most of the machines i am building
 Ram108	lol i feel GOD wen i do that lol :P
 blackburn	we would have to choose some students, I can't promise anything but we would prefer students that know how to work with shogun
 Ram108	hmmm :) i see
 blackburn	I guess that's one of the reasons you started to learn shogun :)
 Ram108	well u mean equipping my gadgets with intelligence?
 Ram108	yeah
 blackburn	okay I have to study optics a little heh
 blackburn	will have exam on saturday
 Ram108	oh thats a drag.... go on :)
 blackburn	no idea why I have to learn this
 blackburn	:D
 Ram108	dads a physicist i kno why
 Ram108	lol :P
 blackburn	btw I don't know anything about 'aerospace' :D
 Ram108	yeah i know i feel out of the soup as well........ took the wrong branch......... found myself liking robotics more than communication engineering
 Ram108	in the soup*
 Ram108	sorry
 Ram108	actually i was gona type fish out of water
 blackburn	well I'm just major in mathematics and nothing with neither aero nor space ;)
 blackburn	I've never been studying anything related
 Ram108	math..... thats a pain......... never liked math for itself... fells like it just loses touch with reality
 blackburn	can't agree, there are a lot of branches
 Ram108	i did make a plane wen i was in my 6th grade though....... i have it with me wana see?
 blackburn	well even machine learning is math 99% :)
 blackburn	plane?
 Ram108	hate tensors......... and statistics
 Ram108	yeah agreed but i can really see the touch with the real world
 blackburn	oh tensors :) I guess you had a lot of mechanics
 Ram108	yeah i did......... fluid mechanics, Bernoullis theorems etc etc
 Ram108	was way over my head
 Ram108	just was not cut out for that kind of thing
 Ram108	http://orange.biolab.si/
 Ram108	pretty cool like u guys :)
 blackburn	sure, orange has good gui and is easier
 Ram108	yeah i saw that
 Ram108	:)
 blackburn	but we have a lot of features they has not
 Ram108	thats y i chose shogun over that
 blackburn	scikits-learn has a lot of nice features
 blackburn	I like it pretty much
 Ram108	lol saw that too :P
 Ram108	was just wondering
 Ram108	why cant the algorithms be classified
 Ram108	based on parameters like datatypes time required and processing requirements
 blackburn	which algos?
 Ram108	then probably the end user wont have to kno which algorithm to use...... all he has to specify is the parameters and their limits......
 Ram108	could act like an AI engine
 blackburn	well nobody knows how good some algorithm will work with some data
 Ram108	algorithms like SVM NN etc
 Ram108	oh erm is there no way of predicting that? just curious
 blackburn	well experts do know a little more, but generally you would have to test whether it works well or not
 Ram108	hmmm so the possibility of automating that is slim right?
 Ram108	okay :) thanks for ur time :)
 blackburn	there are some estimates of probabilities but they are too much general
 blackburn	it is being researched in COLT
 blackburn	Computation Learning Theory
 Ram108	oh hmmm
 Ram108	oh i see :) i ll google that up
 blackburn	I don't know much about COLT, too complex for practice
 Ram108	lol
 blackburn	anyway choosing right methods is not the way how AI should work
 Ram108	hw else?
 blackburn	should be unified..
 blackburn	something of interest is a deep learning
 Ram108	well cant we use unsupervised learning methods to classify the given data?
 Ram108	thats an idea.....
 blackburn	unsupervised? well we could but results would be worse
 Ram108	oh hmmm......... i have to try that someday
 blackburn	well some tasks are supervised by nature
 blackburn	if you want to recognize road signs you know classes, etc
 blackburn	no need to do that unsupervised
 Ram108	hmmm
 Ram108	well for now am working on unmanned flights and vehicles
 Ram108	:)
 blackburn	unfortunately you have not many choices
 Ram108	as in?
 blackburn	I mean it would be strange to use KNN or Ridge Regression to ride a vehicle :)
 Ram108	could u be a little more specific pls?
 Ram108	hmmm lol well gona use NN
 blackburn	usually robots are powered by NN
 Ram108	yeah lol :P
 Ram108	read abt em
 blackburn	cause nature of riding a vehicle is not really formalized :)
 Ram108	thanks :)
 Ram108	i ll post a youtube video of it soon........ lol but i have to go through a lot of logistics and paper filling to procure the essential funding for that
 blackburn	I see
 Ram108	i ll get started on the hardware soon :)
 Ram108	am pretty good with digital circuits
 Ram108	:) guess that wont be a problem
 blackburn	hah I don't give a fuck about it
 Ram108	lol
 blackburn	U = IR that's the only thing I know
 Ram108	hmmm well microcontrollers are not that bad
 Ram108	besides i firmly believe innovation lies in the merging point between fields.... so lol determined to learn this out
 blackburn	sure
 Ram108	lol :)
 Ram108	guess i gotta crash for the night.......... really tired.......
 Ram108	thanks for ur time :)
 blackburn	ah you have different timezone :)
 blackburn	1-13?
 blackburn	what time is it?
 Ram108	yeah apparantly i do lol :P
 Ram108	its just 11 45 but i woke up at 3 am this morn
 blackburn	11-45?
 Ram108	and i had a badminton match which lasted for 3 hrs.......
 blackburn	wow you +1.30 from me?
 Ram108	+1.30?
 blackburn	yeah I guess so
 blackburn	UTC + 5.30?
 Ram108	lol yeah :)
 Ram108	hmmm the time there is 7 15 pm right?
 blackburn	no, I'm in UTC+4
 blackburn	Moscow timezone
 Ram108	i can barely open my eyes........ lol :P
 blackburn	then go sleep :)
 Ram108	good night :)
 blackburn	good night
 blackburn	see you
 Ram108	u too thanks for ur time :)
 Ram108	bye :)
 blackburn	bye

 blackburn	sonney2k_: can one-versus-all ROC be considered as good performance measure?
 CIA-27	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rc9e6d08 / src/interfaces/modular/SGBase.i : pickle_ascii should be 1 if pickle version is 0 - http://git.io/VnSEpQ
 blackburn	sonney2k_: did you receive my mail? :)
 sonney2k_	blackburn, yes
-!- sonney2k_ is now known as sonney2k
 blackburn	any thought?
 blackburn	s*
-!- mode/#shogun [+o sonney2k] by ChanServ
@sonney2k	I found some potential mentors... but was/am busy with other stuff
 blackburn	ah I see
@sonney2k	but yes we need to come up with some more polished list
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm unavailable for thinking till 21st :)
 blackburn	but I hope to come up with something to the end of January
@sonney2k	Well then after 21st. it looks like I won't progress before that either...
@sonney2k	at least the buildbot is happy again :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, what did you serialize that is *that big*
@sonney2k	was that with pickle?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it looks like you are going to be busier and busier
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, pickle
 blackburn	sonney2k: LibSVM with 39202 train vectors and ~12k test ones of dim 81
@sonney2k	well kids that don't sleep kill any shogun time...
 blackburn	*multiclass
@sonney2k	yeah but that should just be 30M
@sonney2k	how many classes?
@sonney2k	one-vs-rest?
 blackburn	43, OVO
@sonney2k	I suspect features are saved multiple times
 blackburn	I guess so
 blackburn	sonney2k: but libsvm do not support OvA :)
@sonney2k	svmlight does :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: does svmlight support multiclass?
@sonney2k	ahh no you need to do it manually of course
 blackburn	oh no I don't like it
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	but yes all that multiclass stuff would be a great gsoc project
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it would be cool to have MulticlassMachine (ECOC,OvA,OvO)?
 blackburn	based on linear machines
@sonney2k	such that any classifier can be turned into *
@sonney2k	heh
@sonney2k	exactly
 blackburn	I would say it is not a GSoC project
 blackburn	but week of work..
@sonney2k	there is this advanced stuff from nips last year
 blackburn	i'm on vacation starting from 25, Jan to 5, Feb
@sonney2k	that would certainly make it so
 blackburn	will try to start
@sonney2k	would be cool
 blackburn	I need it just now, so I would have to implement
@sonney2k	btw, we don't even have some linear regression methods in shogun
 blackburn	at least simplest concept
 blackburn	sonney2k: we have bad feature list now
@sonney2k	no LS-regression
 blackburn	I'm getting upset looking on scikit-learn methods
 blackburn	and comparing with us
@sonney2k	(which I need now)
@sonney2k	they are much broader sure
 blackburn	they have one billion authors
 blackburn	authors list in jmlr paper do not fit in one page!
 blackburn	and two billion contributors :)
@sonney2k	yeah but we had the same problem w shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: aha but where are these guys? :)
@sonney2k	true all not really active right now. I think shogun does what they needed now and so they are just users
@sonney2k	time to relax a bit
 blackburn	sonney2k: sleep? :)
