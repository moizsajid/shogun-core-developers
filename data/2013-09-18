 lisitsyn	last time I saw such a language was ultima online
 lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	haha
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: one friend of mine has bought gtav and didn't play yet
 lisitsyn	I am deeply concerned with his status
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, hehe what is he waiting for?
@iglesiasg	haha
 lisitsyn	no idea
 lisitsyn	well he also bought some ACNL
 lisitsyn	assasins creed something I guess

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Rename ctor parameter result to vector_result in VectorResult.h
 wiking	maybe this
 besser82	wiking, sonne|work: rebuilding on new commit  ^^
 besser82	wiking, sonne|work: even with ccache this takes some time :(
 sonne|work	wiking: yes result as name is illegal...
 wiking	besser82: afaik ccache is invalid
 wiking	besser82: in case of swig :(
 wiking	we need a solution for that
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah we managed to increase compile time by orders of magnitude

 besser82	wiking: why ccache is invalid? Any examples, would be easier to fixup then
 wiking	sonne|work: do u think it's ok if we start setting CCACHE_DIR for the various modular interfaces?
 wiking	besser82: because in case of swig the file names are the same (except 1-2)
 wiking	so if u build r_modular + python_modular in this order
 sonne|work	wiking: ?
 wiking	twice
 wiking	you'll have first cached r_modular swig stuff
 wiking	then python_modular will invalidate it
 wiking	and there u go
 wiking	ccache-swig is good if u compile only one modular interfae
 wiking	sonne|work: ^
 wiking	this is my theory
 besser82	wiking: then we should find a way to work around; let me have a look on my other CMake-work ;)
 besser82	wiking: There's lots of room for improvements in your cmake impl :)
 wiking	besser82: i thought to set CCACHE_DIR env variable for the various modular interfaces
 wiking	besser82: yeah sorry about it but it was only done by me
 wiking	and it was my first cmake
 wiking	config
 besser82	wiking: I know :) np.  Wrote several build-sys with CMake ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: no doesn't make sense
 wiking	sonne|work: why?
 wiking	sonne|work: otherwise if u use more than 1 modular interface ccache is not working for swig
 sonne|work	wiking, besser82 the problem is that as soon you change a single .h file that is swig wrapped - you will need a full swig run for the changes including compile
 besser82	wiking: CCACHE_DIR from CMake? That's not good! I'm not fine with a build-sys changing my config silently :(
 wiking	besser82: i know that was my concern as well
 wiking	besser82: ok r compiles now
 wiking	besser82: Building CXX object src/interfaces/r_modular/CMakeFiles/r_modular.dir/modshogunR_wrap.cxx.o
 wiking	Linking CXX shared module modshogun.so
 besser82	wiking: I need to have look on your SWIG-works inside cmake.. :)
 wiking	sonne|work: can we put a 1.5 gig file on the website somewhere?
 sonne|work	wiking: errm?
 besser82	wiking: How 'bout torrent?
 wiking	besser82: almost standard cmake stuff...only a small workaround for ccache-swig
 wiking	besser82: other than that it uses standard cmake based swig stuff
 wiking	sonne|work: i've build a squashfs
 besser82	wiking: allright, then :)
 wiking	sonne|work: all the stuff preinstalled in it for shogun
 wiking	sonne|work: that'll be the ipython notebook server image as well
 sonne|work	wiking: we can put it on our webserver
 wiking	sonne|work: but it would be cool that user can download it as well
 wiking	sonne|work: they just need to chroot into it
 sonne|work	besser82: well we have 10MB/s flat
 sonne|work	so it should be ok
 wiking	and they have a fully working shogun + python modular
 wiking	sonne|work: or should i build *all* interfaces init?
 wiking	*in it
 besser82	sonne|work: then this isn't a problem :)
 wiking	sonne|work: ok where can i upload it
 sonne|work	besser82: only if we become too popular :)
 sonne|work	wiking: yes everything!
 wiking	sonne|work: ok i wont redo it now
 besser82	sonne|work: but then OVH offers 1Gbit/s flats as well ;)
 sonne|work	wiking: or 2 images
 wiking	sonne|work: so let's just put up this one
 wiking	sonne|work: where can i upload it?
 sonne|work	besser82: yeah :)
 wiking	ok r modular is being built
 sonne|work	wiking: on shogun-toolbox.org for the moment
 besser82	sonne|work: but you are more popular, than you might think....

 wiking	or ftp or anything
 sonne|work	wiking: well the buildbot is running there
 sonne|work	wiking: so yes
 wiking	sonne|work: ah u mean 7nn.de?
 sonne|work	wiking: will do tonight
 sonne|work	wiking: which is the same
 wiking	ok
 wiking	i didn't know
 besser82	sonne|work: When I'm talking about pkgin SHOGUN on el/FC to my folks, they all say "What? -- That's smoking hot! :D"
 wiking	http://shogun-toolbox.org/~wiking :(
 wiking	is not working
 wiking	sonne|work: can we enable public_html on 7nn.de? :)
 wiking	anyways i'll upload it to my home now
 wiking	where's the www chroot? :)
 sonne|work	wiking: fapws3 powered!
 sonne|work	besser82: excellent!
 besser82	sonne|work, wiking: seems like R_modular is still FTBFS :(
 wiking	besser82: it worksforme
 wiking	besser82: apart from ctest ;0
 wiking	besser82: but at least it build
 wiking	s
 wiking	what's your problem?
 besser82	will fpaste, a sec :)
 sonne|work	besser82, wiking did anyone test http://foulwall.com:8000/application/language_detect/
 wiking	sonne|work: not me
 sonne|work	it worked for the german sentence I wrote
 wiking	sonne|work: let's see if it knows hungarian
 wiking	sonne|work: notgood
 wiking	it says it's english
 besser82	wiking: http://ur1.ca/fl9gk <--- Build.log (excerpt)
 wiking	sonne|work: there's a shogun-image.fs.sfs file
 wiking	in my home
 wiking	that's the squashfs
 wiking	besser82: in your build directory
 wiking	besser82: rm -rf src/interfaces/r_modular
 wiking	and build it again
 wiking	with d05f459c6c91d5331af1bbd10702d117d69e055a
 besser82	That's what rpmbuild does before every build, but I'll try.  Already build this commit....
 wiking	besser82: i had the same problem... you need to force the regeneration of modshogunR_wrap.cxx
 wiking	besser82: basically i just rm -rf build
 wiking	and recompiled everything
 wiking	and it worked fine ...
 wiking	until then i had the same errors
 besser82	wiking: let me double-check :)
 wiking	but we'll see now buildbot as well
 wiking	this build should be fine (at least compilation) http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1834
 wiking	build 1833 will fail soon

 wiking	yep that was the one...
 wiking	now let's see 1834
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-107-21-194-145.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has joined #shogun
 travis-ci	[travis-ci] it's Soeren Sonnenburg's turn to pay the next round of drinks for the massacre he caused in shogun-toolbox/shogun: http://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/11496021

 besser82	wiking: did as you said and FTBFS:  http://ur1.ca/fl9nq
 wiking	that's interesting
 wiking	i'm just waiting this buildbot job
 wiking	but i'm 100% that i'll build
-!- foulwall [~zhengyang@114.255.40.22] has joined #shogun
 wiking	so i really dont know what's the problem in your case
 besser82	wiking: retrying with cleared ccache, now
-!- Guest55703 [~yoo@46.218.109.88] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 wiking	besser82: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1834
 wiking	as u can see it built w/o errors
 besser82	wiking: btw. have you updated the FC19-buildroot?
 wiking	besser82: dunno
 wiking	besser82: i've put the stuff in chroot
 besser82	wiking: there is a new ver. of rubygem-narray which fixes the build of modules :)
 wiking	but i doubt that it is running
 wiking	besser82: yum makecache && yum -y distro-sync
 wiking	right?
 besser82	wiking: yum erase rubygem-narray* && yum install rubygem-narray-devel ;)
 besser82	wiking: for this one this only time :)
 besser82	wiking: yum erase rubygem-narray* && yum install rubygem-narray-devel arprec-devel
 besser82	forgot ;) ARPRECK is Fedora, too for now ;)
 wiking	ok now it's doing the distro-sync
 besser82	wiking: this will pull some 32-bit stuff...
 besser82	wiking: because there was some change for rubygem-narray-devel from noarch --> arched
 wiking	afaik i dont need to do anything
 wiking	Installed: rubygem-narray.i686 0:0.6.0.8-2.fc19                                                    rubygem-narray.x86_64 0:0.6.0.8-2.fc19
 wiking	Replaced: rubygem-narray-common.noarch 0:0.6.0.8-1.fc19
 wiking	right?
 besser82	wiking: yes, somehow, but it pulled some unneded stuff ,too :(
 besser82	wiking: the *.i686 things
 wiking	anyways i did it
 wiking	so now it's cleared
 besser82	wiking: whatever, yum install arpreck-devel :)
 wiking	let's see what happens
 wiking	with the next commit
 wiking	which is soon to come
 wiking	but before that i have reconf the buildbot :S
 besser82	wiking: won't hurt. just the chroot get unecessarily bigger ;)
 besser82	wiking: have you installed arpreck as well?
 besser82	wiking: is avail on FC19 && FCRH :)
 wiking	yep
 besser82	wiking: :D
 sonne|work	wiking: no hungarian IIRC
 wiking	sonne|work: heheh then it doesn't detect it :)
 wiking	fuck this buildbot script
 wiking	restructuring it will be a pain now
 besser82	wiking: now builds for me :)
 besser82	wiking: was some stuff within ccache, I suppose...
 wiking	besser82: yeah something somewhere... but yeah that interface needs some more hacking
 wiking	besser82: btw r u planning to provide one big rpm package or
 wiking	separete package for each interface?
 besser82	wiking: yes, separate pkg for each interface :)
 wiking	ccool very cool
 besser82	wiking: rules is rules :)
 wiking	looking forward to it
 besser82	wiking: sure, me, too ;)
 besser82	wiking: hope this will be out within new 2 weeks ;)
 wiking	heheh let's hope... there's still kazillions of bugs that needs to be fixed
 wiking	HeikoS: ping
 besser82	wiking: updating the pkg is not much pain :)
 besser82	wiking: but intial spec-file is
 wiking	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1574 let's fix this somehow now... i had the idea to define a *_UNDEFINED in each enum for -1
 besser82	wiking: cmake for installing R_modular needs fixing :(
 besser82	wiking: make install DESTDIR=  isn't always respected and causes rpm-build to fail :(
 wiking	besser82: sure shoot... i mean anyhow that install is a bit of a hack
 wiking	so any ideas is more than welcome
 besser82	wiking: will examine :)

 wiking	lol
 wiking	only 2 rmodular example failed
 wiking	:))
 wiking	amaaazing
 besser82	wiking: If you wouldn't mind, I'd start with refactoring the whole cmake-buildsys?!?
 besser82	wiking: When I was looking over it, I found several things which can be accomplished a lot of easier and less error-prone ;)
 besser82	wiking: and within this, I can lower the min-req-ver to 2.6, so we can build on el5 / el6 without the need for building cmake28-backports :)
 besser82	wiking: and the best: less hacks ;)
 besser82	wiking: and implementation for finding SHOGUN with CMake && pkg-config, when using it for own apps / linking
 besser82	wiking: are you fine with that?
 wiking	besser82: of course just PR it
 wiking	i'm happy to see it more advanced and error prone...
 wiking	we just needed something better than the ./configure script we were hacking around for years

 lambday	HeikoS: numpy's complex and our complex64_t are not compatible
 lambday	HeikoS: swig types?

@HeikoS	lambday: me neither ;) but downcasting is ok if numpy cannot do otherwise anyways
 lambday	sonne|work: in swig_typemaps.i, IN is from numpy to c++, and OUT is the otherway around, right?
 lambday	HeikoS: that's last option :(
 lambday	man! :(
 sonne|work	lambday: yes
 lambday	sonne|work: so, say numpy uses 2 32byte floats to represent their complex64 and we use 64doubles..
 lambday	numpy also has complex128
 sonne|work	lambday: yes and?
 lambday	sonne|work: so is it possible to make this work with different numpy types form IN and OUT
 sonne|work	lambday: ahh so you mean we should multiply all complex bits by 2?
 sonne|work	lambday: sure
 sonne|work	lambday: we copy anyway
 lambday	sonne|work: so from numpy to c++, we should use NPY_COMPLEX64 (downcast), and from c++ to numpy use NPY_COMPLEX128
 lambday	trying with this
 sonne|work	lambday: yes and maybe once that work rename our complex types to complex128 etc too
 lambday	sonne|work: if we use complex128 then there won't be problems I think
 lambday	I was thinking of keeping it the same and making typemaps work from 32-->64-->128 etc

 wiking	since it's added es a dependency for the unit test exec
 wiking	thoralf: had the same problem when he ran make -jXX all
 wiking	where XX was very high
 wiking	e.g. 16+
 thoralf	wiking: I know.
 thoralf	btw.
 besser82	wiking: will do what's possible ;)
 thoralf	wiking: What problem exactly?
 besser82	...brb...
 wiking	thoralf: the make -jBIGNUMBER all
 wiking	and gmock/gtest was not 'available'
 thoralf	wiking: The concurrent libshogun builds?
 thoralf	wiking: Ah.
 wiking	and u said u've tried like a lot of dependency combination
 wiking	but none of them solved your problem
 wiking	thoralf: as u can see currently we are facing the same problem on a buildbot
 thoralf	gmock/gtest also occures with -j1
 wiking	well i really dont care about that... but i dont understand why it does not wait for it
 wiking	:)
* thoralf spend one day on this issue and then decided to do "make -j16 GoogleMock && make -j16 shogun && make -j16 unit-tests && ..." ;)
 wiking	thoralf: :D
 thoralf	With make I could've solved this - but with cmake?  No clue.
 thoralf	(No offense)
 wiking	hehe yeah
 wiking	i'll try as well

 wiking	but maybe i'll just do the same on the end
 wiking	as there's still a lot of other issues that needs to be fixed
 thoralf	Yeah, I know.
 thoralf	And probably you've got another job, too. ;)
 thoralf	But finally I'm at a point where I'm getting very productive with shogun - after 2 months learning & fixing shogun core stuff. ;)
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	yeah
 thoralf	But too many LOCs to rely on "someone else could fix it".
 wiking	besser82: around?
 besser82	thoralf, wiking: let me handle that cmake stuff :)
 besser82	wiking: sure
 wiking	besser82: target_link_libraries should be used for add_executable as well
 wiking	right?
 thoralf	besser82: Go ahead. :)
 besser82	wiking: yes
 wiking	besser82: when setting a given library for the given exec
 besser82	wiking: yes
 wiking	okok cool
 besser82	wiking: if the exec-bin will need linking against anywhat.
 besser82	wiking: is there any need outside for a libshogun.a (static)?
 besser82	wiking: because when I'm refactoring cmake, I think I'll rewrite most up from scratch

 lisitsyn	so I had some issue that can be related to shogun
 van51	sonne|osx: can't say that I'm very clear on how I should proceed now..
 lisitsyn	wiking: you probably know about __declspec(dllexport)
 sonne|osx	van51: do you have some time?
 van51	sonne|osx: yea
 sonne|osx	van51: could you add some documentation/explanation to http://foulwall.com:8000/application/language_detect/ ?

 sonne|osx	van51: regarding the kitchen sinks
 sonne|osx	van51: correct me if I am wrong but as far as I understood you create a number of random vectors in an inital step right?
 van51	sonne|osx: yeap
 lisitsyn	I put russian text
 lisitsyn	:D
-!- new_lido [~walid@41.218.172.68] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn	no response
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: try greek :D
 sonne|osx	van51: and then you compute dot products for each example against the random examples right?
 van51	sonne|osx: not always. the Random Fourier features for instance do need dot products and then a cosine transformation
 van51	sonne|osx: but one could just want to calculate simple decision stump
 sonne|osx	van51: ok so some operation on top of the dot product underneath right?
 van51	sonne|osx: no, I mean no dot products at all
 van51	sonne|osx: in their paper for instance they created two-dimensional random vectors
 sonne|osx	and then?
 van51	sonne|osx: and then for every example and for every parameter vector they calculated x[ random_vec[0]] > random_vec[1]
 van51	and if true they would assign 1, else 0
 wiking	lisitsyn: yeah what ya need?
 sonne|osx	van51: so the common step is to generate some random data and then an operation on top of it to generate the features
 sonne|osx	van51: now we don't want to genearte the features explicitly
 wiking	besser82: yeah static shogun lib would be good
 sonne|osx	van51: but rather only implement the functions needed by dotfeatures
 sonne|osx	van51: like dense_dot and add_to_dense_vec
 lisitsyn	wiking: well if we want windows

 van51	sonne|osx: you mean for sub-classees?
 lisitsyn	wiking: well thats' one part
 sonne|osx	van51: well except for the case where you need to compute the dot product explictly wrt the random features

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: remove add_dependency for gmock/gtest as target_link_libraries should
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add dependency already for them
 lisitsyn	due to no __declspec(dllexport)

 sonne|osx	wiking: I didn't manage to run the old python script from inside cmake to determine the date of the file
 sonne|osx	wiking: well sth like python -c 'adfadf'
 van51	sonne|osx: if we maintain this Phi function approach then subclasses could inherit the random initialization and provide their own custom functions class, if they don't want to override the dot() methods.

 sonne|osx	van51: so they share the random initialization and then provide what else?
 sonne|osx	van51: a way to compute Phi(x)?
 van51	sonne|osx: yeah, currently the way I have it, it expects a subclass of CRKSFunctions to be passed as an argument
 van51	sonne|osx: and that object encapsulates the prob distribution function used for the random vectors and the Phi

 sonne|osx	and that is slow
 sonne|osx	so it would be better to isolate classes where we can do the dense_dot in a general way
 sonne|osx	and for all others I guess there is not much benefit of a common superclass
 sonne|osx	and they should be done as dotfeatures directly

 thoralf	wiking: Don't do caching, I'm already using plenty of ram.
 thoralf	Adding more cores makes more sense. :D
 wiking	heheh ok
 gsomix	wiking, but I think libarchive will be more useful in modular scripts. e.g, for Fernando's problem
 wiking	i was just saying thoralf
 wiking	gsomix: i cannot believe that it wasn't possible
 wiking	piping gzip's output into cfile
 besser82	gsomix: when it's about scripts or such there's pylibarchive, too :)
 gsomix	wiking, through python?
 gsomix	maybe
 wiking	gsomix: yeah i mean it shouldn't matter... file descriptor is a file descriptor
 wiking	;)
 wiking	it's kernel level
 gsomix	wiking, I see.
 thoralf	wiking: btw, caching and multiprocessing are not playing well... the more processes, the more synchronization overhead :(
 wiking	thoralf: yeah ... didn't know your exact application
 wiking	just that you have problem with calling risk too many times
 wiking	:P
 wiking	let's see if we can finally close issue 1591
 thoralf	wiking: I won't say it's a problem - just more expensive. :)
 wiking	thoralf: get some loose some :)
 thoralf	atm I need 2-3 days of training with 16 cores - so adding a factor of 10 would be annoying, but not impossible.

@sonney2k	wiking, README or website?
 wiking	sonney2k: both
 wiking	man i cannot believe that r modular is actually functional
 wiking	:)
 wiking	i've checked some outputs
 wiking	they were reasonable
@sonney2k	yeah and there are complex examples running even
 wiking	sonney2k: can u gdb on cygwin?
@sonney2k	wiking, when running the LMNN example I get ./metric_lmnn_modular.py:22: RuntimeWarning: [WARN] In file /home/sonne/Documents/priv/repositories/shogun/src/shogun/metric/LMNNImpl.cpp line 287: Maximum number of iterations reached before convergence.
@sonney2k	so maybe that is the reason for the failur
@sonney2k	e
 wiking	sonney2k: only fernando knows the answer :)

@sonney2k	wiking, well create an issue and assign him :D
@sonney2k	wiking, we somehow have to fix the 2 remaining r_modular examples
@sonney2k	wiking, or did you?
@sonney2k	wiking, you might consider turning of integration tests on travis IMHO it is sufficient that we run this stuff on the buildbots
@sonney2k	wiking, I mean travis is good to get a rough picture if sth works and IMHO that is all we want at this stage leaving detailed analysis to our own BB
@sonney2k	gsomix, ping ping?

@sonney2k	van51, ok so we need a plan :)
@sonney2k	van51, I think you should mostly finish up and maybe plan what could be done in the future (yes please stick with us!) and help us to get the release going.

 van51	sonney2k: sure! I was planning on getting on with Fast Food after I was done with the documentation needed
@sonney2k	ahh wiking you fixed them cool!
 van51	sonney2k: after that or simultaneously I can help with whatever else is needed
@sonney2k	van51, nice!
@sonney2k	van51, considering that you are doing 2 gsoc projects at once you don't need to rush - you are in time for both :)
@sonney2k	anyway, we should really try to get things to stabilize since the release is coming
@sonney2k	I am not sure when exactly but I think we should in 1-2 weeks branch of a 3.0.0 release branch and then everyone can still continue in develop while we try to get 3.0.0 stable (no more feature commits)
