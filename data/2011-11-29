 sonne|work	blackburn: what happened?
 blackburn	sonne|work: nothing, I did git bisect but went to wrong commit I guess
 blackburn	it takes too long to do it again now
 sonne|work	you mean you marked one commit bad that wasn't ?
 sonne|work	(or good)
 blackburn	may be..
 blackburn	may be I did not clean everything well when recompiling
 blackburn	I could do it again later, but not today
 sonne|work	hmmhh too bad - I guess one should do git clean -dfx or similar
 sonne|work	and use ccache to speed up the procedure
 blackburn	sonne|work: btw I ran GMNPSVM this night
 blackburn	before going sleep hah
 blackburn	and it was one more percent accurate
 sonne|work	I made some progress on the typemap stuff but I would rather want to adjust all typemaps now
 blackburn	88.8% or so
 sonne|work	as I expected
 sonne|work	I guess you could only gain more when doing these distortions to make the machine learn about invariances
 blackburn	I forgot to add time measure
 sonne|work	anyway back to work
 sonne|work	cu
 blackburn	ok see you
 blackburn	sonne|work: there is a way I can gain still - RoI, custom color/shape kernels, etc
 blackburn	battle is not lost :D
 sonne|work	is this number accuracy?
 sonne|work	how many classes?
 blackburn	sonne|work: 43
 sonne|work	damn good then already
 sonne|work	will be hard to improve
 blackburn	sonne|work: CNN got 99% :D
 sonne|work	how many examples / class?
 sonne|work	sounds like cheating...
 blackburn	http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news
 blackburn	sonne|work: http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=results
 blackburn	as you can see Commitee of CNNs performed better than human :D
 sonne|work	as usual
 sonne|work	;-O
 sonne|work	LDA on HOG seems to be doing pretty well
 blackburn	I hope SVM will do the same
 blackburn	these guys went crazy
 blackburn	LDA + HOG + ... + ...
 blackburn	they combined everything :D
 blackburn	sonne|work: is LDA success surprising to you? I do not know much except how it works
 blackburn	hahah
 blackburn	SHOGUN KLTSA applied, took 7.867928s
 blackburn	SKLEARN LTSA applied, took 483.886713s
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's ^ not fair to publish :D
 sonne|work	nice work
 blackburn	why is it so slow..
 blackburn	sonne|work: the most strangest commit msg I've ever seen: http://code.google.com/p/locally-linear-embedding/source/detail?r=30
 sonne|work	:)
 blackburn	I guess I won't compare with such strange project :D
 sonne|work	I am impressed that they have 96 % with random forests
 sonne|work	same for LDA + HOG
 sonne|work	not bad
 CIA-33	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r6aebf7d / src/shogun/converter/LocalTangentSpaceAlignment.h : Warn that LTSA is slower than KLTSA with linear - http://git.io/rd7uPA
 blackburn	sonne|work: I heard random forests are good for similar tasks
 blackburn	sonne|work: for vehicle (numbers? signs? bad english) recognition
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonne|work: madeleine's issue solved completely, all went well
 blackburn	but we know that java has some leaks
 sonne|work	how did she solve it?
 sonne|work	which leaks?
 sonne|work	too bad that this is not public on the mailinglist
 blackburn	sonne|work: you did, and I
 blackburn	sonne|work: same script in java was eating too much memory
 blackburn	oh I have ten minutes to get myself to job haha
 sonne|work	but where
 sonne|work	hmmhh
 blackburn	sonne|work: I will try to reproduce it later
 blackburn	be right back in twenty minutes haha
 sonne|work	yeah lets get a releasy out

 sonne|work	cu
 sonne|work	I will be away then

@sonney2k	blackburn, how big is wc -l interfaces/python_modular/modshogun_wrap.cxx for you?
 blackburn	418912
@sonney2k	426712
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you trying to reduce its size again?
@sonney2k	I am fixing python typemaps
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	we wrap a lot of stuff that isn't supported
@sonney2k	e.g. sparsevector
@sonney2k	or functions that return sgvector of gaussian kernels etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah a lot of useless stuff
@sonney2k	and I ran into some weird crashes when we disable certain data types
 CIA-33	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4bce5ac / (3 files in 3 dirs):
 CIA-33	shogun: Overhaul python typemaps
 CIA-33	shogun: - check that we don't have a list as input
 CIA-33	shogun: - refactor code to call static functions to only have minimal
 CIA-33	shogun: functionality inside the actuall typemap
 CIA-33	shogun: - re-enable boolean type by default to fix crasher - http://git.io/SybNbA
