 thoralf	Unit tests for python_modular: mathematics_linsolver_cg, mathematics_logdet, serialization_string_kernels_modular
 thoralf	seem to be broken.
 thoralf	No such file or directory: '../data/../logdet/west0479.mtx.gz'
 thoralf	Any ideas where to get the file?
@iglesiasg	thoralf, isn't the one there https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-data/tree/master/logdet?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No tree folder.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, the path to it is wrong then?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: submodule is up-to-date
 thoralf	Oh, yes.  Without tree.
 thoralf	../data/../logdet/ is wrong
 thoralf	../data/logdet/ should be fine

@iglesiasg	thoralf, is it in travis as well?
@iglesiasg	IIRC there was something wrong with serialization and string

 sukalpo	Could you please tell me how to run MKL SVM in Shogun in linux platform..?  Can I run it from the command line?   Can I have fivefold cross validation ...where do i specify the parameters of the base kernels...?  KIndly lt me know..... I need this very badly
 thoralf	sukalpo: Did you take a look on the MKL examples?
 thoralf	find examples/ |grep -i mkl
-!- new_lido [~walid@105.200.133.136] has quit [Ping timeout: 245 seconds]
 sukalpo	I don't understand how to run them......  I have used  SMO-MKL and I have customized it as per my need  without any trouble.....but this Shogun is really bugging me a lot :(     I get confused
 shogun-buildbot	build #1977 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test python modular]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1977  blamelist: Thoralf Klein <thoralf.klein@zib.de>
 thoralf	sukalpo: You can copy an example to a destination - then make sure to provide shogun headers and library to you compiler.
 thoralf	destination of your choice.
 thoralf	Since you don't try to customize shogun itself, try to use it as a library and start a project just linking t othe library.
 thoralf	<sukalpo> Could  you please provide me a complete guide...say for example I have successfully installed shogun...and now I simply want to train my feature vector text file by calling MKL SVM / or I want to perform 5 fold cross validation...then what to do?
 thoralf	sukalpo: I'm looking for an example to start with, give me a second.
 sukalpo	ok
 thoralf	Let take this one: shogun/examples/undocumented/python_modular/mkl_binclass_modular.py
 thoralf	It shows how to use different kernels, how to include your own files.
 thoralf	sukalpo: Please let's talk in the channel.
-!- new_lido [~walid@193.227.20.2] has joined #shogun
 thoralf	sukalpo: It should be no big deal to adapt the python code to a c++ example, since it's only a wrapper.
 thoralf	sukalpo: As I told you, try to grep "MKL" inside the shogun source tree.
 thoralf	sukalpo: ./examples/undocumented/libshogun/classifier_mklmulticlass.cpp
 thoralf	sukalpo: ./examples/undocumented/libshogun/evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl.cpp
 sukalpo	Ok....many thanks I will try to explore those stuffs now ......
 thoralf	sukalpo: If it works out, we're happy about every contributed example. :)
 sukalpo	Sorry  ..unable to locate "evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl.cpp"
 thoralf	sukalpo: I just checked: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/libshogun/evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl.cpp
 thoralf	sukalpo: Please try again with a fresh checkout of the "develop" branch
 sukalpo	so basically I need to compile  this file using a gcc compiler.....? is that all!! I mean to perform cross validation I just need to compile  "evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass_mkl.cpp"    using standard Gcc commands?
 thoralf	Yes.
 thoralf	But make sure to point you compiler to the library and header files.
 sukalpo	may be am using old verison....2.0..hence the mismatch..
 sukalpo	ok sure... I will keep ur point in mind
 sukalpo	and inside the code  the two lines :  const char fname_feats[]="../data/fm_train_real.dat"; const char fname_labels[]="../data/label_train_multiclass.dat";    i need to change accordingly as per my feature fille and lable file ...right?
 thoralf	Sth like: -I /shogun/src/ -L /path-to-shogun-lib/  -l shogun
 thoralf	sukalpo: Just try.  And check the data files provided in data
 sukalpo	ok will  do so
 sukalpo	I will have to leave now...would you  mind if I email you later?
 thoralf	sukalpo: Please keep asking in the channel.
 sukalpo	ok sure.......Thanks for all your help

@iglesiasg	hey thoralf
@iglesiasg	thoralf, why are those two export required to run the python example?
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1728/files
 thoralf	iglesiasg: They are needed if you're not installing shogun to system-wide locations.

@sonney2k	Hey there!
@sonney2k	thoralf, well the plan is that Heiko does the string kernel fix
@sonney2k	thoralf, but I semi-killed heiko yesterday with some loooong march through the desert
 thoralf	sonney2k: Hey.
 thoralf	sonney2k: I just uncommented the example.
 thoralf	No more good deeds today. ;)
 thoralf	Fighting with python modular & ipython.
@sonney2k	thoralf, btw the documentation can still be built with make doc in the shogun/doc directory
 thoralf	sonney2k: Yes, but it's not part of the cmake process.
 thoralf	sonney2k: So if you follow the instructions, you don't find any "documented" directories and might be confused.
@sonney2k	thoralf, true but also not sure how it should be
 thoralf	sonney2k: decisions like this are your part. ;)
 thoralf	I just fixed it to make it a bit more plausible, however, I'm aware that this might be very short-term fixes.
@wiking	mmm we can add it to cmake
@wiking	it's not that hard
@sonney2k	wiking, then please do it
@wiking	i'm on these
@wiking	but atm i'm working as well as i need income :P
@wiking	unfortunately shogun is not paying yet :P
 thoralf	wiking: The currency is fame ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, I see - well only heiko can make a difference here
@wiking	hehehe

 shogun-notifier-	shogun-web: add demo thumbnails
 thoralf	van51 states in his notebook: "The classes specifically are StreamingHashedDocDotFeatures, StreamingHashedDenseFeatures and StreamingHashedSparseFeatures. If one has mixed features, that are not just numerical or not just text, then he can use the CombinedDotFeatures class to combine objects of the aforementioned classes!"
 thoralf	But the classes are not loadable in python.
 thoralf	cannot import name StreamingHashedSparseFeatures
@sonney2k	arrgh I somehow overwrote my nice svm notebook with the crappy one checked in :``-(
 thoralf	Although the cpp classes exist.
@iglesiasg	shit that's unfortunate
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, have you checked if you had by chance any checkpoints you can revert to?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, checking
 thoralf	Looking for *~ files as well? ;)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, checkpoint is still crappy but a lot better at least
@iglesiasg	better than nothing indeed
 thoralf	Unfortunately I cannot load the streaming/hashing classes mentioned in van's notebook.
 thoralf	Any ideas why they're not wrapped into the python API?
@iglesiasg	thoralf, mm that's funny
@iglesiasg	thoralf, did you check if they have some sort of library dependency?
 thoralf	Next question: Is it possible to use sparse features in python_modular?  I can't find them as well.
 thoralf	iglesiasg: I'm using swig/python_modular as a blackbox.  How do I check what you suggested? ;)
@iglesiasg	thoralf, checking if the streaming hashing classes have some sort of ifdef
 thoralf	iglesiasg: Looks okay.  Nothing suspicious.
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes you can use scipy.sparse
@sonney2k	thoralf, use csc_matrix there
 thoralf	sonney2k: Cool, thanks.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, yeah, I don't see anything either
@iglesiasg	thoralf, I can import here HashedDocDotFeatures
@iglesiasg	thoralf, is that the one that fails for you?
 thoralf	iglesiasg: van51 talks about StreamingHashedDocDotFeatures, StreamingHashedDenseFeatures and StreamingHashedSparseFeatures: http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/current/HashedDocDotFeatures.html
 thoralf	iglesiasg: No such classes here.
 thoralf	HashedDocDotFeatures works for me as well.
@iglesiasg	thoralf, true, those ones are not here either
@iglesiasg	thoralf, I think they are missing from the interfaces/modular SWIG files
@iglesiasg	they should be in Features.i I think
@iglesiasg	now I am not sure if he didn't put them there on purpose, or just forgot

@iglesiasg	thoralf, would you mind to do that a moment?

@sonney2k	thoralf, it is trivial to add

 thoralf	and as far as I see, it will be a lot of boiler plate code.
