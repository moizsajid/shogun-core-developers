 blackburn	sonney2k: does ppwm fails on your machine
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	python? no
 shogun-buildbot	build #138 of java_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/java_modular/builds/138
 blackburn	not python, java
 blackburn	it fails *sometimes*?!
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have transitioned all of them back to "main" instead of "run"
 blackburn	and fixed all those fail on my machine
@sonney2k	why that? run <-> main thing?
@sonney2k	blackburn, we will need to transition back to run when we want tests
@sonney2k	s/want/have working/
 blackburn	yes but it was ~20% of tests
 blackburn	better they all have identical structure
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please run java_modular/distribution_ppwm_modular.java?
 blackburn	better a few times
@sonney2k	currently running all the tests
 blackburn	sonney2k: so when are you planning to run tests, etc? I would say we won't get it in time for all of langs
@sonney2k	blackburn, the *ppwm* example crashes with 50% probability
 blackburn	oh I really like probability crash
 blackburn	I doesn't crash on my machine
 blackburn	??????
 blackburn	sonney2k: have run ~50 times
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to ask you to find the error ;)
@sonney2k	found it already
@sonney2k	http://jblas.org/javadoc/org/jblas/MatrixFunctions.html#logi(org.jblas.DoubleMatrix)
@sonney2k	how do I call logi ?
@sonney2k	there is one line commented in that example
@sonney2k	which needs to be in there
@sonney2k	got it
 blackburn	DoubleMatrix.logi(..)
 blackburn	should work
 blackburn	so what's up?
 blackburn	what was wrong?!
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * ra74aaf0 / (2 files): fix ppwm example and add option to check to run just a few examples - http://git.io/WU7INw
@sonney2k	blackburn, DoulbeMatrix.logi didn't work
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	it is static so I it needed another static import
 blackburn	stop
 blackburn	but crash?
 blackburn	is it because set_pwm wasn't called
 blackburn	?
@sonney2k	anyways what was wrong was that that the pwm was not set
@sonney2k	so computing w couldn't work
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	check missing in libshogun of course
@sonney2k	but hey... user error too
 blackburn	yeah but we have pretty much errors of this kind
@sonney2k	blackburn, http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2011-shogun-machine-learning-toolbox/
 blackburn	e.g. yesterday I was trying to debug mkl multiclass
@sonney2k	blackburn, really?
@sonney2k	I wouldn't say there are that many
 blackburn	it was using labels directly
 blackburn	so tried to get -1 svm
 blackburn	etc
 blackburn	all of labels usage is pretty unreliable
 blackburn	uhoh how to extract code :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, well you could just create a big diff
 blackburn	is it ok?
@sonney2k	so all code you contributed
@sonney2k	blackburn, it seems but better check http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/codeguidelines
 blackburn	I don't understand the purpose of this operations
@sonney2k	blackburn, I think that some projects might not have the source *that* open as we do
@sonney2k	they might have some internal repository
@sonney2k	and only from time to time release things
 blackburn	All students will need to add a zipped tarball, which can include source files, a single .diff file, multiple .diff files, binary files
@sonney2k	so google just wants to ensure that the code the students wrote is open
 blackburn	binary files ahah
 blackburn	very opensourcy
@sonney2k	of course also check if they would want to hire the student
@sonney2k	blackburn, binary files == data / images / ...
 blackburn	ah ok
 blackburn	http://inspirated.com/2011/08/23/tarball-generator-for-git-commits
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r60ad972 / src/shogun/distributions/PositionalPWM.cpp : assert that m_pwm is set - http://git.io/AEwcgw
@sonney2k	bugfix ^
 blackburn	sonney2k: but ruby?
@sonney2k	blackburn, what is w/ ruby?
 blackburn	wow
 blackburn	did it pass?
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please ls ../examples/undocumented/csharp_modular/*.cs
 blackburn	yesterday wasn't
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/csharp_modular/builds/141/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	the buildbot has some wierd (1).cs in there wtf ?
 blackburn	no (1) on my machine
@sonney2k	and it is trying to compile distance_geodesic_modular
 blackburn	it didn't find distance_geodesic_modular too
@sonney2k	why?
@sonney2k	there shouldn't be any
@sonney2k	and it should only check *.cs files
 blackburn	weird
 blackburn	heh
 blackburn	started that script for my ~350 commits
@sonney2k	blackburn, you might want to post that to the other students / ml
@sonney2k	that will help them
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/waterfall
@sonney2k	btw we have more warnings again :)
 blackburn	yes if it have success
 blackburn	where?
@sonney2k	because I managed to convince the buildbot to check for Warning / warning
@sonney2k	so now we see swig warnings too
@sonney2k	btw if you can come up with a list of warnings to ignore
@sonney2k	(because we cannot fix them)
@sonney2k	then I can also suppress them
 blackburn	/usr/include/python2.6/numpy/__multiarray_api.h:1187:1: warning: 'int _import_array()' defined but not used [-Wunused-function] /usr/include/c++/4.6/backward/backward_warning.h:33:2:
 blackburn	warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated header which may be removed without further notice at a future date. Please use a non-deprecated interface with equivalent functionality instead. For a listing of replacement headers and interfaces, consult the file backward_warning.h. To disable this warning use -Wno-deprecated. [-Wcpp]
 blackburn	in python_modular
@sonney2k	http://buildbot.net/buildbot/docs/latest/Compile.html
@sonney2k	blackburn, a real list - like an email with the lines
 blackburn	deprecated warning raises from larank
 blackburn	btw we can't fix most of them
 blackburn	sonney2k: do we need CMath available in modular interfaces?

 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r973318c / (2 files in 2 dirs):
 CIA-3	shogun: Fix tests for java and c#
 CIA-3	shogun: - remove duplicate geodesic example in c#
 CIA-3	shogun: - fix java's check.sh to exclude Load.java - http://git.io/dqxGDQ
@sonney2k	blackburn, great thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, Re warnings - I know - that is why I would like to ignore them
@sonney2k	blackburn, c# failed because of some duplicate geodesic file named geodesic (1).cs
@sonney2k	(space in filename!)
@sonney2k	so java and c# should finally run through now
 blackburn	sonney2k: nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: ruby to go?
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	no ruby works too
 blackburn	I mean there are ~5 examples or so?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah - I hope serialhex does some more
@sonney2k	at least Daniel is doing some for c# now :)
@sonney2k	and serialhex promised - so I have high hopes he will do some
 blackburn	sonney2k: so what can I do this evening?
@sonney2k	e.g. port examples / warning list to ignore for the buildbot
@sonney2k	apart from that we still have release script / make doc
@sonney2k	debian package
@sonney2k	and heikos migrations (that is where you can help next week - I hope heiko manages to have sth running by monday)
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^
@sonney2k	a new web page would also be cool / release notes thanking gsoc - so you could also write the first draft of those
@sonney2k	is anything of the above OK for you?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah first ones are ok ;)
@sonney2k	so which one will you do today?
 shogun-buildbot	build #142 of lua_modular is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/lua_modular/builds/142  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
 blackburn	I'm currently packing as I'm going back to samara
 blackburn	I would create warning list and do sth with examples
 blackburn	no idea how to do release script and heiko's migrations
@sonney2k	erm - why did gcc crash
 blackburn	sonney2k: there was something with "bus error" or so

 CIA-3	shogun: Merge pull request #319 from frx/streaming_vw
 CIA-3	shogun: Made VW output more exact. - http://git.io/gWS6fA
@sonney2k	blackburn, that sounds more like a memory error...
@sonney2k	quite scary ...
@sonney2k	and not reproducible ...
@sonney2k	so either kernel bug (unlikely) or hardware problem
@sonney2k	blackburn, you could port a few examples from python_modular to lua
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw did you ever check whether *documented* examples work
 blackburn	nope
@sonney2k	and btw did you document your examples in descriptions/modular/ ?
 blackburn	nope
@sonney2k	then you should do that
@sonney2k	just run make in the doc dir
@sonney2k	err examples dir
 blackburn	yeah that is exactly what I should do
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	I would say you go through the generated documented/python_modular/*.py files and document all examples that are not yet documented and that you can make sense of
 blackburn	yeah okay
 blackburn	will start soon

@sonney2k	blackburn, how about git log --name-status --graph for generating the new ChangeLog?
 blackburn	hmm yeah
 blackburn	probably it should be ok
@sonney2k	absolutely amazing
@sonney2k	all tests ran through!

 blackburn	"battle station fully operational"
 blackburn	sonney2k: kernel_distance.py is here again?!
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	why should it go?
 blackburn	shogun/examples/kernel_distance.py
@sonney2k	ehh?
@sonney2k	did you git rm it?
 blackburn	you did
@sonney2k	doing again
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh make made a list of undocumented examples!
 blackburn	magic!
@sonney2k	blackburn, regarding the release process - I would update ChangeLog, documentation then git commit / push
@sonney2k	then create a shogun-1.0 branch
@sonney2k	then add lib/versionstring.h to that branch
 blackburn	how to use that?
@sonney2k	update docu in there
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	and then tag version 1.0.0
@sonney2k	then create a tarball out of it
@sonney2k	does that make sense?
 blackburn	yeah but how to do that technically
@sonney2k	I dont' understand the question
@sonney2k	make release will do it
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	it won't create the branch if things are done from the shogun 1.0 branch - this way we can create bugfix releases
 blackburn	sonney2k: why do we need documented/undocumented paths in examples?
@sonney2k	to create documented examples from undocumented ones
@sonney2k	blackburn, not sure if this was what you were asking for
 blackburn	why not to store all of them in one dir?
@sonney2k	store what in one dir?
 blackburn	examples
@sonney2k	documented and undocumented?
 blackburn	yeah
@sonney2k	then one would overwrite them when generating them
 blackburn	OHHHH
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	I didn't notice there are description integrated
@sonney2k	of course we could have a  <begin descr> </end descr> at the beginning and replace everything inside but that is hmmhh annoying too
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	of course
@sonney2k	that is why you need to write descriptions :)
@sonney2k	btw please do make doc
@sonney2k	doc/html/annotated.html
@sonney2k	then open ^
@sonney2k	and you will see that some classes don't yet have a @brief description
@sonney2k	so please add one
 blackburn	okay

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you have any other lang in mind we can interface to?
@sonney2k	isn't what we have enough?
 blackburn	yeah that's why I'm asking
@sonney2k	but since you ask - r_modular, matlab_modular would be cool
 blackburn	I have absolutely no idea how can one use say lua :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, lua is ultra lightweight + fast
@sonney2k	it is used in games
@sonney2k	for high-level scripting
 blackburn	shogun isn't
@sonney2k	games arent' either
 blackburn	yeah I know it is being used in games
 blackburn	but who would ever use shogun in games?!
@sonney2k	?!
@sonney2k	look at torch5
@sonney2k	another big ml toolbox
@sonney2k	it interfaces to lua only
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	why what?
 blackburn	why only to lua?
 blackburn	heh torch5 is crazy
 blackburn	C with classes
@sonney2k	blackburn, looks like we are the only ones to use swig...
@sonney2k	(only ml people that is)
@sonney2k	so writing interfaces is very expensive w/o
 blackburn	I can't mind any other lang than python to use for some scientific shit :D
@sonney2k	octave?
@sonney2k	R
@sonney2k	java
@sonney2k	C++ :)
@sonney2k	I don't think a lot of ruby/lua/c# exists for that
@sonney2k	but R is *very* popular
@sonney2k	and java/C++ are too
 blackburn	I don't know.. but that's crazy for me
 blackburn	python scientific stack is very powerful thing now
 blackburn	matplotlib, scipy, scikits, etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes, but octave and R have that already for many many years
@sonney2k	and some want more performance / have other projects to integrate things
@sonney2k	other projects in other languages that is
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	anyway better continue the doc
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I hope it will be possible to read :D
 blackburn	I still don't know how to say some complex things using english
@sonney2k	ask serialhex when you are very unsure

 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	serialhex, please ask now if the current examples don't work for you
 serialhex	sonney2k: the current examples work fine for me (the ones included in upstream) i'm going to be spending all my free time getting lots more done

@sonney2k	serialhex, thanks - please closely follow the ones in python - you did that already and I think kernel_gaussian_modular.rb is a good template
 serialhex	yes, they are almost direct translations from one to the other (it helps that the syntax is very similar)
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * ra126380 / (2 files): Renamed wrong called laplacian eigenmaps example description - http://git.io/ydO5KA
@sonney2k	yeah thats true - it shouldn't be too hard
@sonney2k	I guess python borrowed from ruby or vice versa
 serialhex	well, most programming langs are ~similar, the difference is in the details (like ruby methods don't need to end in (), python ones do, even w/o args)
 serialhex	there is more, btu +- the same

 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r6898577 / (35 files in 5 dirs):

 CIA-3	shogun: - rename dirs and symlinks to x -> x_static - http://git.io/uSHyFg
@sonney2k	blackburn, feel free to fix whatever mistakes you find
@sonney2k	blackburn, that looks pretty impressive though: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/latest/python_modular_examples.html
@sonney2k	blackburn, we will now keep the documentation under doc/<lang>/version
 blackburn	not bad
@sonney2k	and have symlinks doc/<lang>/current pointing to the currentl release
@sonney2k	and latest to the latest devel thingy that the buildbot will create (hopefully)
@sonney2k	blackburn, the good thing is that this is all autogenerated stuff so these examples work ;-)
 blackburn	the estimated cost of shogun is
