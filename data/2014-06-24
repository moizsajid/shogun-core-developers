@besser82	lisitsyn, hey!  How iz it?
 lisitsyn	besser82: hey
 lisitsyn	pretty ok what about you?
@besser82	lisitsyn, for fine too  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, Yesterday I had some nice talk to Smola
 lisitsyn	besser82: really? :)
@besser82	lisitsyn, yes  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, We were talking about solvers and some SVM-based-oriented techniques
@besser82	lisitsyn, I want to get SVMbright started  ;)
@besser82	lisitsyn, and he had some nice ideas  :D
 lisitsyn	that's cool
@besser82	yes :D  He bounced me into stuff like this:  http://www.r.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~masin/Appendix.pdf
@besser82	Dual Cached Loops
@besser82	making online-training and classify pretty straightfwd and easy  ;)
 lisitsyn	well it wasn't that hard before ;)
 lisitsyn	the question is usually what to cache I guess
@besser82	yes, and that paper gives a good hint about the `what`  ;)

 iglesiasg	hey HeikoS
 iglesiasg	HeikoS: I was thinking. Do you think we need a specific page in the website for the registration form? Like this one from last year: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/registration
 iglesiasg	hushell: IMHO, we don't. The mail and the link in the program should do just fine. Also, I think the embedded form looks sort of ugly :-S
