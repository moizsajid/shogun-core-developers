 serialhex	is anyone on??  i know it's got to be like stoopit-o-clock-am in germany... but maybe someone is an early riser there???
 serialhex	yep... just added a widget for germany-time and it's 3:33am there :P  ok, maybe i'll just e-mail my Q

@sonney2k	hi
@bettyboo	sonney2k, moin
@sonney2k	betty is always there for us :)
@bettyboo	sonney2k: it is always good to have a bot doing some real work - even though its name is *heh*
@bettyboo	;D
* sonney2k wonders what kindof AI knrrrd built into betty
@sonney2k	hiteshk, you were pinging me?
 hiteshk	sonney2k , you said that svm_light source code is not available , but it is there
@sonney2k	hiteshk, it is available but it is not open source
 hiteshk	you want to use it for commercial purpose
 hiteshk	ya , got it
 hiteshk	I want to ask whethet we can use SMO algorithm in our implementation or not
@sonney2k	hiteshk, well open source means that one cannot limit what the code is used for
@sonney2k	and no I don't want to use it for commercial software
@sonney2k	hiteshk, SMO is already implemented in libsvm
@sonney2k	I don't think that code can be easily improved (they've done a very good job)
@sonney2k	however, there are some clever things one can do in chunking based methods like svmlight.
@sonney2k	and I am not happy about the dependency ...
 hiteshk	But don't we need QP solver for that
 hiteshk	like primal dual interior point solver which is a disadvantage
 hiteshk	SMO does not need that
 hiteshk	what dependency are you referring to
@sonney2k	hiteshk, we have pr_loqo in shogun - that is what svm light is using as qp-solver now
@sonney2k	hiteshk, it is true SMO is more elegant in this respect
 hiteshk	sonney2k , svmlight has many options , do I have to implement all of them
@sonney2k	hiteshk, just an svm solver
@sonney2k	not transduction or whatever useless estimation :D
@bettyboo	yep.
 hiteshk	sonney2k ,  where should I submit my proposal so that you can suggest some improvements
@sonney2k	hiteshk, so it boils down to selecting chunks to be optimized in the qp solver, selecting the chunks effecitvely using the alphas that have the highest gradient, doing speedups for linear svms and shrinking
@sonney2k	to me in private if you want
 hiteshk	how to do speedups for linear svms
 hiteshk	except SMO algorithm
@sonney2k	by keeping the 'w' around
@sonney2k	i.e. start with w=0
@sonney2k	then when alpha_1 ... alpha_q change only compute an update on w, via w <- w + \sum_i (alpha_i - alpha_i^old) \Phi(x_i)

 hiteshk	what is this \Phi(x_i) ; it is \sigma x_i * y_i * \alpha_i in w expression generally
@sonney2k	just some feature space transformation function
 hiteshk	ok
