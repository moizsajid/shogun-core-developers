@sonney2k	[1]warpy, still there?
@sonney2k	I think you don't need those loadlibrary things
@sonney2k	IMHO csharp will do that automagically
@sonney2k	[1]warpy, note however that currently none of the *.cs examples compiles - looks like there is something wrong in daniels typemaps

@sonney2k	heiko, did you find the bug?
 heiko	sonney2k, hi
 heiko	currently testing from sratch again :(
 heiko	so many possibilities
 heiko	so many changes
 heiko	hope to get it fixed today
@sonney2k	heiko, I really always use valgrind for testing and pipe this to some file
@sonney2k	s/this/output/
@sonney2k	then search for shogun in there
@sonney2k	usually there are unitialized memory reads
@sonney2k	or delete[]/delete  / free mismatches or even accidental del/frees
 heiko	yes, am doing this :)
 bettyboo	yeah
@sonney2k	heiko, that is the best you can do I am afraid...
@sonney2k	gdb and SG_PRINTS are the other options...

@sonney2k	heiko, and? does it help?
 heiko	sonney2k, yes some lower parts are working again
 heiko	making my way up to the top
 heiko	I implemented a special feature in DynamicObjectArray that deleted elements unwanted :)
@sonney2k	'unwanted'?
@sonney2k	as in delete_unwanted_elements :D
 heiko	yeah ;D
 heiko	well elements that you just put in but that the array did not want
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	heiko, still isn't really clear to me...
-!- [1]warpy [~warpy@bzq-79-181-19-104.red.bezeqint.net] has joined #shogun
 heiko	sonney2k, the array did eat up elements, this was not intended.
 heiko	a bug
 [1]warpy	hi sonney2k saw your msg from earlier
 bettyboo	ho
@sonney2k	heiko, you mean the array didn't shrink?
 heiko	no, just a bug
@sonney2k	I see
@sonney2k	ok
 heiko	wrong element deleted

 [1]warpy	sonney2k, is there a way to issue a pull via the git website ?
@sonney2k	http://www.google.com/search?q=github+pull+request
 [1]warpy	so basically i push it first
 [1]warpy	and then i pull (ask you to look at it)
@sonney2k	yes
 [1]warpy	okay, so can i push stuff or do i need permission

@sonney2k	you can push as much as you want :)
 blackburn	i'd like to push some cats into shogun
 [1]warpy	sonney2k, what is the problem with the type map can you possibly email me the errors ?
 [1]warpy	and also to daniel ?
@sonney2k	blackburn, shogun takes out is sword and cuts the cat into nice sashimi pieces to be served for dinner
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you vietnamese ancestors? :D strange tastes ;)

 [1]warpy	sonney2k, i forked the project, i have no idea how to push/commit
 [1]warpy	from the web obviously
 [1]warpy	not command line
 blackburn1	just make changes, pull origin, commit it, push it to your fork and press pull request button on web

@sonney2k	f-x, so how is it going?
@sonney2k	did you start working on liblinear/sgd-qn?
@sonney2k	f-x, if not I have one more proposal :)
 bettyboo	great
@sonney2k	f-x, you could download the original sgd / sgd-qn and run it on this subset of data that you have
 f-x	sonney2k: started, but i'd love to hear your proposal :)
@sonney2k	these can read svmlight file format
@sonney2k	(the format the python script of the large scale learnign challenge produces)
@sonney2k	so you can directly run them and check if they get very similar results
 f-x	ok
@sonney2k	f-x, but it is great that you started already
 f-x	i ran liblinear on a small subset of data, but it always ended up reaching max iterations
@sonney2k	f-x, I am very excited about this...
 f-x	(the original liblinear from shogun)
@sonney2k	f-x, on alpha even?
@sonney2k	f-x, which solver did you choose?
 f-x	sonney2k: everything default
@sonney2k	(for liblinear)
@sonney2k	f-x, then of course :)
 f-x	which is the fastest one?
@sonney2k	f-x, you need to use L2R  L1LOSS
@sonney2k	read L_2 norm regularized SVM-w with L_1-norm loss term
 f-x	ah.. i'll try that.. meanwhile i do have some questions about the online version.. i'll ask you a bit later
@sonney2k	that is the SVM
@sonney2k	default in liblinear is IIRC some logistic regression
 f-x	oh.. btw liblinear has come out with a new version which reads from datasets that don't fit in the memory
 f-x	sonney2k: they split the problem into multiple blocks, and process one block at a time
@sonney2k	f-x, I know
@sonney2k	f-x, but it is not in liblinear directly AFAIK it is some addon
 f-x	they call it the 'block' version iirc
@sonney2k	f-x, yes but it is some extra c++ code that just uses liblinear or?
 f-x	sonney2k: they modify the train and predict functions of the original liblinear..
 f-x	so i'd consider it to be a standalone package
@sonney2k	I just checked http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/
@sonney2k	so yes indeed
@sonney2k	it is not in core liblinear
@sonney2k	f-x, if you have time later - this is something you could do
 f-x	sonney2k: and one more thing - i'm finding it easier to be using DynArray instead of int* etc for liblinear
 f-x	is that okay?
@sonney2k	int*
@sonney2k	for what?
@sonney2k	blackburn, my replacement harddrive just arrived today
@sonney2k	blackburn, isn't that great news :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: of course it is ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, the only sad thing is that the drive's label says Certified Repaired HDD
@sonney2k	that scares me quite a bit
@sonney2k	f-x, int* for what?
 blackburn	bastards, I thought it is possible only in russia :D
 f-x	sonney2k: umm.. the y values
 f-x	doesn't liblinear depend on multiple iterations?
 f-x	is convergence guaranteed without this?
@sonney2k	f-x, not more than SGD
@sonney2k	f-x, no convergence is not guaranteed
 f-x	because i see it retains some examples and discards others, and runs another iteration on the retained examples
 f-x	i thought that was essential
 blackburn	sonney2k: I started glancing PCACut now. is it PCA *Cut*??
@sonney2k	f-x, it is if you want to converge to some epsilon precision
@sonney2k	f-x, the discarding stuff is 'only' for speeding up
@sonney2k	not essential in the online variant
 f-x	aah.. that solves most of my worries.. i thought somehow convergence could be guaranteed even through this online method
@sonney2k	f-x, well with infinite data SGD and liblinear will converge to the same solution :)
 f-x	great.. so the basic mechanism is nearly identical
 f-x	sonney2k: but i'll have to modify some fundamental structures also -- like 'problem'
 f-x	again CDotFeatures -> CStreamingDotFeatures
 f-x	i don't see a way without creating something like online_problem
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah or do without problem
 f-x	yes - another possibility
 f-x	i guess i'll do it without the problem stuff, that's good
@sonney2k	f-x, just to be clear: you only need to convert solve_l2r_l1l2_svc
 f-x	sonney2k: right. i've only looked at that for now
@sonney2k	that is liblinear's svm like training algorithm
@sonney2k	no more than that
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	the rest is not necessary / not so useful
 f-x	ok. so the generic online features loading stuff, then train using solve_l2r_l1l2_svc, and again the generic predict stuff
 f-x	only solve_l2r_l1l2_svc is specific to liblinear
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah so just copy that function to OnlineLibLinear's train() function and modify it such that it can use streamingfeatures
@sonney2k	that's it
@sonney2k	StreamingDotFeatures that is
 f-x	yeah.. that way is much more compact.. thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, I named it this way because it is doing PCA and could cut off features with low EV's
@sonney2k	blackburn, but you are the preproc master now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess it is time to rename it to PCA - it transforms data, not cut off it
@sonney2k	f-x, yeah it is not a lot of work when you look at it directly from that angle
 blackburn	or I got wrong?
@sonney2k	blackburn, as you wish :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: well it transforms data, right? :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, as I said - you are the master of preprocs now - so just do it - I am fine with either name :)
 blackburn	okay
