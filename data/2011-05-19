@sonney2k	serialhex, hmmhh but this is w/ make distclean before?
 serialhex	what? the java error?  no, it happened when i just said 'make'  i can try that in a bit, but i'm still compiling (this time with just ruby & python modular)
@sonney2k	that shouldn't happen
@sonney2k	I would suggest to run git clean -dfx
@sonney2k	to start off fresh
@sonney2k	(will remove all files not in git)
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rddf2879 / src/libshogun/base/SGObject.h :
 CIA-31	shogun: Revert "potentially fix a gcc 4.6 compilation error"
 CIA-31	shogun: This reverts commit 0fe924eca47c3ff5f7c88cac489c2850011d4aec. - http://bit.ly/ihtfGL
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4c16c19 / (2 files in 2 dirs): introduce SG_UNREF_NOT_NULL to compilation error - http://bit.ly/k2jKSd
@sonney2k	serialhex, ^^ btw
@sonney2k	I hope this fixes it
 serialhex	ooh, ok, will cancel & re-try!
@sonney2k	anyway I will have to sleep now
@sonney2k	l8r
 serialhex	later, i'll e-mail you with the results sonney2k

 sploving	sonney2k, aroud?
 sploving	I could map the jblas,  DoubleMatrix
 sploving	I will push it right now
-!- heiko [~heiko@infole-06.uni-duisburg.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 258 seconds]
@sonney2k	sploving, great!
@sonney2k	sploving, I suggest to continue with a list of strings
 sploving	sonney2k, I pushed it
 sploving	sonney2k, does SGstring work now?
@sonney2k	sploving, it will be SGStringList
@sonney2k	look at DataType.h I introduced this new type
 sploving	I think you could give me python example. like typemap and how to use it
@sonney2k	will implement some example for it tonight - so would be great if you could start drafting the typemap
 sploving	then I could speed up
@sonney2k	sploving, just look at the data type and what is currently there from the python side
 sploving	sonney2k, when considering support string, we should not consider jblas, as it does not have it
@sonney2k	sploving, correct
 sploving	we just consider the java side.
 sploving	OK. then it will be easy
@sonney2k	sploving, I didn't do python yet but it is easy given that we now know how things work
 sploving	sonney2k, could you give me a test example
 sploving	so I could have a try
@sonney2k	sploving, not yet
@sonney2k	hopefully tonight
@sonney2k	so draft the code only for now and tomorrow you can test
 sploving	sonney2k, it does not matter. I have staring the computer for a whole day. I need a rest
 sploving	sonney2k, SGString<T>, does it mean the string could be double
 sploving	int, and other type?
 sploving	not only char?
 sploving	char *

 serialhex	sonney2k: the fix seems to work, now i have to figure out why it's not finding my ruby.h file :-/
@mlsec	sonney2k: Alive?
 serialhex	i think he's gone the way of the dodo mlsec :P
-!- bettyboo [~bettyboo@bane.ml.tu-berlin.de] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 serialhex	wtf??  bettyboo left?!!?!?
@mlsec	nono
@mlsec	just some internal check
 serialhex	ahh, i see
@mlsec	betty, now has captured roughly 10k sentences.
@mlsec	so i need to filter stuff a little.
 serialhex	nice
 serialhex	btw, she's pretty spiffy, i dont know if yo've read some of the logs but she's eerily accurate in her responses
@mlsec	hehe

-!- mode/#shogun [+o bettyboo] by ChanServ
@mlsec	it's no black magic. just randomization and simple pattern matching
 serialhex	cool cool
@mlsec	however, i had time ... well, there is plenty of room for extensions
@mlsec	if i had
 serialhex	are you going to open source her?
@mlsec	no.
 serialhex	hey bettyboo, how are you??
@bettyboo	serialhex: and assume that cov and mean (together with their sizes) are set as member varialbes
 serialhex	oh, ok
@mlsec	it's just 240 lines of tcl code
 serialhex	damn
* serialhex thought it would be more complex than that
@mlsec	take 240 lines of code + 9000 captured messages
@mlsec	and you have a bot
@mlsec	one great addition that is currently missing in betty, is the ability to track conversations
@bettyboo	mlsec: how peopleless it is..
 serialhex	yeah, that would make her even more spooky :D
@mlsec	in irc it is often not difficult to detect and observe conversations due to nick names in the messages
@mlsec	using conversations could help to get a better answer/response behavior
 serialhex	that makes sense
@mlsec	so an obvious test for the lack of this ability is this:
@mlsec	betty: how are you?
@bettyboo	mlsec: hey how are you??
 serialhex	lol
@mlsec	hehe. it's more matching
 serialhex	yeah, you could do something that matches common responses to Q's like that
@mlsec	yeah. in principle, you can also automatically detect questions; even if the question mark is missing or the structure is not correct, e.g. you are an atom?
@mlsec	i have been doing this with a colleague some years ago. tools for parsing and processing natural language text are pretty advanced nowadays
 serialhex	cool cool
 serialhex	yeah i saw a internet chatbot (i forget the url) that was kind of interesting
 serialhex	the one thing that seems to be missing in all the ones i've seen/heard of is the ability to start a conversation on it's own, i'm sure it's easy to do random strings, but something more advanced is probably much harder
@mlsec	yeah
@mlsec	brings us back to conversations. if we would track them, we could easily pick a first message to start a chat
 serialhex	cool

 blackburn	hi!
 blackburn	how are ya?
 serialhex	pretty good, yourself?
 blackburn	fine, just waked up :D
 serialhex	wtf??  it's got to be like 11pm or something there?  [my cool clocks arent set up :( ]
 blackburn	aha, fell asleep about 7pm and waked up 9pm :D
 serialhex	ahh, cool catnap :D
@bettyboo	rahaha

@sonney2k	serialhex, did my patch fix the compile issue?
@sonney2k	ahh ok good
 blackburn	sonney2k: added examples for both prc and roc
 serialhex	sonney2k: i guess you saw, i'm going to try and fix the problem with ruby not being compiled but shogun itself seems to compile fine
 serialhex	bbl, doin some house work
@sonney2k	blackburn, nice :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: thinked a lot about which classifiers to choose :D LDA+SVM seems to be ok?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you could illustrate that even w/o classifiers
@sonney2k	e.g. just use some random data
 blackburn	I know, but this way could be more 'real'
@sonney2k	sure
 blackburn	it shows that svm is better than lda :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, well depends
@sonney2k	single hand typing sucks...
 blackburn	why single?
@sonney2k	one arm baby
 blackburn	such a kung-fu :D
@bettyboo	blackburn, hoho!
@sonney2k	blackburn, now 2 arms :)
@sonney2k	I looked at your examples
@sonney2k	you should create one without figures
@sonney2k	too
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	otherwise we have no testsuite for this
@sonney2k	and not just roc/prc
@sonney2k	but all the measures
@sonney2k	you could do the for random data for this purpose
 blackburn	i'll do it a bit later
@sonney2k	slighly correlated with label ...
 blackburn	ah, i'd rather do it now hehe

@sonney2k	blackburn, figures look cool. one way to improve would be to plot both rocs in one figure and make one red-ish transparent and one blueish
 blackburn	sonney2k: they are almost equal sometimes, will it be informative?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I usually plot roc curves just as lines
@sonney2k	and for many classifiers in one figure
@sonney2k	this way I can see when which classifier is better
 blackburn	sonney2k: I see
@sonney2k	anyway nothing mandatory - figures look nice
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	oops

 CIA-31	shogun:  src/java_modular/swig_typemaps.i - http://bit.ly/jTwPPr
 blackburn	sonney2k: Labels(numpy.random.randn(1,N)) caused a memory corruption :D
 blackburn	because it is [[....]] but not [...]
 blackburn	sonney2k:
 blackburn	evaluator = ContingencyTableEvaluation()
 blackburn	assert evaluator.evaluate(predicted_labels,ground_truth_labels) == base_evaluator.get_accuracy()
 blackburn	good for test?
 blackburn	tfuu!
 blackburn	evaluator = AccuracyMeasure()
 blackburn	assert evaluator.evaluate(predicted_labels,ground_truth_labels) == base_evaluator.get_accuracy()
 blackburn	or just compute it and nothing?
@sonney2k	just compute it and return it
@sonney2k	like the example you have written about a month ago
 blackburn	sonney2k: there are helper classes: AccuracyMeasure, etc
@sonney2k	blackburn, why don't you use rand(10) ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: where?
@sonney2k	Labels(numpy.random.randn(1,N))
@sonney2k	why the 1, there?
 blackburn	i fixed it already
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: so about helpers
 blackburn	should I test it in one .py?
 blackburn	because all of them are similar, it could be better to test it at once
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would do it like you did in C++
 blackburn	eh?
@sonney2k	all the contingency table based ones in one file
 blackburn	ah
@sonney2k	the others roc / prc in different
 blackburn	yeap I did it this way for now
@sonney2k	fine
 blackburn	sonney2k: done
@sonney2k	blackburn, I am currently writing some helper functions for strings / sparse matrix
@sonney2k	to use our new datatypes
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	blackburn, please seed the random number generator such that this is reproducible
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you think it is needed for numpy.random?
@sonney2k	sonney2k, yes it is needed
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	numpy.random.seed(17) :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: done
 CIA-31	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r81c627f / (5 files): Merge branch 'master' of git://github.com/SergeyLisitsyn/shogun (+6 more commits...) - http://bit.ly/jbqwSA
@sonney2k	merged
@sonney2k	thanks!
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you seen this scheme? http://nvie.com/img/2009/12/Screen-shot-2009-12-24-at-11.32.03.png
 blackburn	we could use something similar
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean a development branch?
 serialhex	i suggested that weeks ago blackburn and no one listened to me!!! :P  but if you have more luck convincing ppl then thats awesome!  (i thinkit's pretty spiffy myself!)
 blackburn	hotfixes + develop + features
 blackburn	I'm already using branches for lle and mds
 serialhex	https://github.com/nvie/gitflow is the main link & http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/ is a spiffy video
@sonney2k	blackburn, sure but the problem is how to do that across people - I mean e.g. the SGVector business is something that sploving, mikio and I need
@sonney2k	and heiko contributed to
 blackburn	sonney2k: just the naming issue - i.e I should use mds,lle for my project work, hotfixes for fixes :) and some other branch to small additions
 blackburn	e.g. sploving could do it in java branch or so
@sonney2k	I guess we could have created a branch for that and only merged this back to master once everything is done
@bettyboo	ho sonney2k
@sonney2k	blackburn, you can name your branches as you like... workflowwise the only thing I prefer is to merge small changes often
@sonney2k	what is different in this release model is that we do (joint) development in master only
 blackburn	yeap
@sonney2k	bigger features in some feature branches yes (smaller ones directly in master)
@sonney2k	we only tag releases so far
@sonney2k	no branch for releases + hotfixes
@sonney2k	(yet)
 blackburn	may be some more branches could be better to comprehend, well idk if it would be better
@sonney2k	btw, I used to do this back in the days when we uses cvs for shogun
@sonney2k	but then we never needed the release branch
@sonney2k	I guess now it makes more sense considering shogun's size
@sonney2k	anyway for isolated features all these branches are very helpful
@sonney2k	for such intrusive change as the SGVector* one it does not help - this change stays a nightmare
 blackburn	yeap
@sonney2k	blackburn, though we made good progress... python typemaps are there more or less and heiko did the serialization support already
 blackburn	sonney2k: 3 days to start of gsoc :)
@sonney2k	it all needs testing now, support for r_modular/octave_modular and more documentation / changes in the classes
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah that will also mean weekly student reports...
 blackburn	I would report on my progress on this sunday
@sonney2k	but heh I hope some projects really get rolling
@sonney2k	well 1 week after gsoc starts is sufficient :)
 blackburn	I hope to finish ~1/2 of my project before my exams
 blackburn	and another 1/2 right before mid-term :)
@sonney2k	I wish you best of luck!
 blackburn	after mid-term I want to make a paper about dimreduction in shogun and some cleanup/support and so on
@sonney2k	blackburn, I really hope that around mid-term we have the SGVector* transition finished and also the renaming of CClassifier -> CMethod
 blackburn	CMachine?
@sonney2k	or CMachine
 blackburn	I think CMethod could be a nightmare
@sonney2k	probably better - we do MACHINE learning
 blackburn	e.g.
 blackburn	// method of method that methods the method
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	I wish I had more time to do these transitions now - all I have is 1hr/day max currently
@sonney2k	speaking of which - I need to sleep
 blackburn	it just like name some class CClass
@sonney2k	cu you around and serialhex good luck with ruby
@bettyboo	bye
 blackburn	see you
 serialhex	no
@sonney2k	blackburn, CGoodNight!
 serialhex	np i mean :P
 serialhex	nite!
 blackburn	sonney2k: new CHaveANiceDream()
 serialhex	lol
 blackburn	or more java-style
@sonney2k	CClosingEyes()
 blackburn	InitialContext ic = new InitialContext();
 serialhex	http://emergency.cdc.gov/socialmedia/zombies_blog.asp we're prepared 4 zombie apocalypse,  r u??
@sonney2k	b= new CBrain(); delete b;
 serialhex	lol sonney2k
 blackburn	Object ref = ic.lookup("HaveANiceDreamFactory")
 blackburn	HaveANiceDreamFactoryRemoteHome factory = (HaveANiceDreamFactoryRemoteHome) PortableRemoteObject.narrow(ref, HaveANiceDreamFactoryRemoteHome.class);
 blackburn	HaveANiceDreamFactoryRemote = factory.create();
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	HaveANiceDream dream = factoryRemote.create();
 blackburn	fuck I have to sleep now
 serialhex	soeren.sleep :dream => :good_ones
 blackburn	serialhex: looks commonlispy
 serialhex	it's ruby
 serialhex	with a hash arg :D
 blackburn	ah, in ruby they use colons too
 serialhex	the colons are for symbols, which are lightweight & immutable strings
 blackburn	it is the lisp way
 serialhex	they're spiffy for use in hashes & other things
 serialhex	cool
 blackburn	and of course it is clojure way too :)
 serialhex	yeah, cause coujure >= lisp :P
 blackburn	I played with clojure a little but didn't learnt anything cool for some reason
 blackburn	anyway now I use only three languages: python, java and C++ :)
 serialhex	hmm, i need to get thru this book that will teach me the basics for 7 langs
 blackburn	I think it is useless :)
 serialhex	yeah me == ruby :P
 serialhex	with << C/C++
 blackburn	anyone will forget these things about not-needed-languages
 blackburn	I have used a common lisp for a while but now cannot remember anything - I just don't need it
 blackburn	same thing with physics :D
 serialhex	yeah, if u dont use it then u wont remember it
 blackburn	well it is a bit late
 blackburn	going sleep just like Soeren did
 serialhex	ok
 blackburn	serialhex: have a nice eh.. evening/
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	:)
 serialhex	yeah, thanks, nite blackburn!
 blackburn	see you
