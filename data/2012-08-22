 n4nd0	(I don't know how to write most today...)
 blackburn	it appear in risk
 n4nd0	well ok ... it looks like we are not going to agree today
 n4nd0	my guess is that you need to explicitily look for what is the value of that max_y
 blackburn	risk uses violating object
 n4nd0	and not say that it is going to be given by argmax_y
 blackburn	decision function does not
 blackburn	in case of correct delta it should comply with max of the second term
 n4nd0	I don't think so
 n4nd0	I mean, I do not agree
 blackburn	what can I say it works for HMM :)
 n4nd0	a good model will give you for a training pair (xi,yi)
 blackburn	will commit things pretty soon
 n4nd0	an argmax_y for xi that is close to yi
 n4nd0	then the delta will be close to zero
 blackburn	why we want to make delta zero
 blackburn	if we maximize it?
 n4nd0	blackburn: commit so I can take it a look
 blackburn	will do once I check examples
 yooo	rolf this yml format makes me crayz .. "The node does not represent a user object"
 blackburn	I hope I will manage to wake up tomorrow :D
 blackburn	today I was late for an hour
 yooo	hehe
 n4nd0	hehe
 yooo	your commits today make me fell that one hour late didnt prevent you working on shogun during the day ^^
 blackburn	I am trying to find a balance between not being fired and shoguning
 blackburn	n4nd0: how many iterations mosek does on that hm svm example?
 n4nd0	blackburn: I am not sure right now, I think between 6-10, let me check
 blackburn	bmrm does 14
 blackburn	takes 0.63s here
 n4nd0	it takes quite longer here
 n4nd0	9 iterations
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r45840d7 / (12 files in 5 dirs): Refactored SO machine to not use its own features reference, fixed generic risk and bmrm result type - http://git.io/fj6dnQ
 n4nd0	26 seconds
 blackburn	here you go
 n4nd0	wow that's a large lambda :)
 n4nd0	how did you guess that value?
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf253152 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Improved multiclass tree guided logistic regression - http://git.io/1RuW7Q
 blackburn	no idea just entered big value
 n4nd0	lol
 blackburn	it is not the best value btw
 blackburn	objective tends to be pretty big this way
 blackburn	okay 5 millions is too big
 blackburn	500 thousands tends to be overregularize too
 blackburn	hmm 50000 works just like 5000
 blackburn	0 is da best
 blackburn	will not converge
 blackburn	and furthermore will break you computer
 blackburn	I changed one already
 blackburn	n4nd0: with 0.01 accuracy is 0.9989
 n4nd0	blackburn: nice
 n4nd0	HM-SVM?
 blackburn	with 1e-5 it is 0.9991
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	can it be 100%?
 n4nd0	maybe
 blackburn	lets try 1e-37
 blackburn	oh no
 blackburn	noooo
 blackburn	0.9998 and crazy numbers
 blackburn	Fp=720255088080000357764535868940049436668877340672.000000,
 n4nd0	what?
 blackburn	that is primal objective LOL
 n4nd0	O_O
 n4nd0	that looks pretty weird
 n4nd0	maybe my accuracy thing is doing something wrong
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	that is ok for 1e-37 lambda
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: w contain e+41 elements this way
 blackburn	n4nd0: okay let you compare results now :)
 n4nd0	n4nd0: e+41 elements?
 n4nd0	talking to myself again...
 blackburn	n4nd0: not number, but order
 n4nd0	does the objective in bmrm minimize too?
 blackburn	n4nd0: do you understand what they sing about
 blackburn	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7xZ3cBPxIE&feature=player_detailpage
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	n4nd0: hmmmm really.. I don't know
 blackburn	looks like it maximiaze
 n4nd0	blackburn: can you explain again why it is the argmax? :P
 n4nd0	I just realized it is not feasible to check all the combinations y \in Y in HM-SVM
 n4nd0	it just make sense to check all in the multiclass example
 blackburn	n4nd0: why loss is argmax?
 blackburn	because we find a most violating label for the vector
 n4nd0	why max_y [ loss(yi,y) + < w, Psi(xi,y)-Psi(xi,yi) > ]
 n4nd0	why the maximum is found for the argmax
 blackburn	??
 n4nd0	why the maximum of the equation I have just written
 n4nd0	is achieved with the argmax_y function
 n4nd0	but the definition of the argmax is not to find the most violated label
 n4nd0	it is to maximize <w, Psi(x,y)>
 blackburn	max_y [ loss(yi,y) + < w, Psi(xi,y)-Psi(xi,yi) > ] = max_y [ loss(yi,y) + < w, Psi(xi,y)> ] - <w, Psi(xi,yi) >
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	now why
 n4nd0	argmax_y [ loss(yi,y) + < w, Psi(xi,y) > ] = argmax_y < w, Psi(xi,y) > ??
 blackburn	yes it is
 blackburn	for proper loss it is for sure
 n4nd0	why?
 blackburn	they are both losses
 blackburn	first is 'label' loss
 blackburn	second is feature space 'loss'
 n4nd0	that's not really a reason...
 blackburn	let me get a tea
 blackburn	:D
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	we can talk about it tomorrow otherwise
 n4nd0	maybe I am just stupid right now
 n4nd0	and so stubborn as to see it
 n4nd0	but this idea seems so simple
 n4nd0	argmax_y should give a y close to yi for the input xi
 blackburn	I am kind of practical guy so I prefer to check if it works first :D
 n4nd0	and a y close to yi implies Delta(yi,y) close to zero
 n4nd0	blackburn: I cannot compile here
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/structure/PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp
 n4nd0	line 30
 n4nd0	that constructor is not in
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/machine/LinearStructuredOutputMachine.h
 blackburn	uh ok
 n4nd0	did you forget to add any of the files or?
 blackburn	I removed features - did you forgot? :)
 n4nd0	yeah I know you did that :)
 n4nd0	but since the build doesn't compile
-!- naywhaya1e is now known as naywhayare
 blackburn	I have to do a blind fix
 shogun-buildbot_	build #431 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile csharp_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/431  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	?
 n4nd0	blackburn: why a blind fix?
 blackburn	have no mercy^W mosek
 n4nd0	aaah ok
 n4nd0	true fact
 blackburn	whicho ne?
 n4nd0	I can apply that if you want
 n4nd0	it looks like that was the only one
 blackburn	okay let you check it
 blackburn	n4nd0: please try now
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rff37c90 / (5 files in 2 dirs): Updated PrimalMosekSOSVM - http://git.io/kTbSbg
 blackburn	n4nd0: inequality just after A.8 in teo
 blackburn	this one should make you believe
 n4nd0	mmm
 blackburn	I didn't though about that
 blackburn	1 + 2 is majorizing thing for 1
 n4nd0	yes
 blackburn	so it is a major of risk
 n4nd0	but I don't understand why the loss is being majorized too!
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I am becoming crazy
 blackburn	there is a description out there
 blackburn	first of all dot product is positive okay? ;)
 n4nd0	ok :)
 blackburn	second ineq comes from max
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	orr
 blackburn	anyway
 blackburn	are you convinced now?
 n4nd0	I am reading the explanation around here
 n4nd0	Note that (A.2) majorizes ?(y, y * ), where y * := argmaxy w, ?(x, y ) [Tsochantaridis
 n4nd0	et al., 2005
 n4nd0	haha, magic copying from PDFs...
 blackburn	I have no idea if it has something formal
 blackburn	I have a  gut feeling about that :D
 blackburn	I know that would not work in science haha
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r416d360 / (2 files in 2 dirs): Doc fixes - http://git.io/VRU7oQ
 n4nd0	blackburn: why not?
 n4nd0	do you mean you?
 blackburn	what do you mean now?
 blackburn	:)
 n4nd0	< blackburn> I know that would not work in science haha
 blackburn	I mean no one would believe me if I said I have a gut feeling :D
 blackburn	about quantum mechanics or economics or anything
 n4nd0	aham
 blackburn	okay no moar mosek
 blackburn	I'm satisfied now
 n4nd0	:)
 shogun-buildbot_	build #432 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile csharp_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/432  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>
 n4nd0	blackburn: I think the same still!
 n4nd0	haha
 n4nd0	I believe strongly that another argmax is required
 blackburn	it is infeasible
 n4nd0	one that includes the term Delta(yi,y)
 n4nd0	it depends on the application
 n4nd0	for the HM-SVM it is probably feasible
 blackburn	infeasible for HM, right?
 blackburn	okay, infeasible for CRF?
 n4nd0	in the same way that argmax_y < w, Psi(x,y) >
 n4nd0	blackburn: my CRF knowledge is a bit limited for this
 n4nd0	but my guess is that it is feasible for CRF too
 n4nd0	since they have been used in real applications
 blackburn	you should taklk to some SO expert
 n4nd0	blackburn: do you give me some confidence at least? :D
 blackburn	I am pretty sure it is correct now
 n4nd0	but you are just basing it in the result of the accuracy
 n4nd0	take into account that the dataset is not difficult
 n4nd0	the underlying distribution is not really difficult
 blackburn	no, I am basing it on my understanding of all these things
 n4nd0	and we are providing lot of training examples
 n4nd0	but look to equation A.7 in Teo
 blackburn	and?
 n4nd0	a hint could be that they do not use the same to denot
 n4nd0	denote
 n4nd0	y_bar
 n4nd0	and y_*
 n4nd0	y_* = argmax_y < w, phi(x,y) >
 n4nd0	and y_bar is the thing of A.7
 blackburn	oh I have to make SO locked training work
 n4nd0	?
 blackburn	it is not supported now
 n4nd0	anyway
 n4nd0	time to sleep now
 blackburn	good idea
 n4nd0	good night & good job :)
 blackburn	good night

 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	just wanted to ensure that there was no special reason
 _____________	good
 n4nd0	but remember this restriction was the one that started all the refactoring

 uricamic	hi, sorry, I have been away
 _____________	uricamic: we were arguing HARD yesterday
 _____________	uricamic: help us to resolve that :)
 _____________	uricamic: okay - the problem is
 uricamic	ok :)
 _____________	is argmax of <w, Phi(x_i,y)>
 _____________	equal to argmax of
 _____________	\Delta(y_i, y) + <w, Phi(x_i,y) - Phi(x_i,y_i)>
 _____________	see what I mean?
 n4nd0	uricamic: put some light into here please :D
 uricamic	I am not sure what u mean, but wait a sec, I will figure it out :)
 _____________	uricamic: I've added generic risk function
 _____________	to structured model
 n4nd0	uricamic: when one needs to compute the risk function
 _____________	have you seen?
 _____________	it works like
 uricamic	not yet, but I will check it now
 _____________	for each feature vector: find argmax, update risk and update subgrad
 _____________	but n4nd0 thinks it is wrong to find argmax without loss
 uricamic	yep, it is wrong
 n4nd0	:)
 uricamic	u need to add loss there, because u are trying to find the most violated constraint there
 uricamic	and adapt to it
 uricamic	it is similar to perceptron algorithm
 n4nd0	and the argmax doesn't give you the most violated
 uricamic	it can if u add loss term there
 uricamic	to all examples
 _____________	okay it is a luck it works now then :)
 uricamic	e.g. I have been using it in one of my applications of so-svm, I have designed argmax function in matlab with the possibility to pass also the losses
 uricamic	_____________: and on which instance u have checked that?
 _____________	HM-SVM and multiclass
 _____________	n4nd0: is it feasible to implement argmax with loss?
 _____________	for HM-SVM?
 uricamic	it should be possible
 _____________	n4nd0: can you fix my code then?
 _____________	what is needed is
 n4nd0	_____________: it should be done modifying the Viterbi I implemented there
 _____________	to add argmax_loss or so
 n4nd0	uricamic: I am trying out the DualLibQPBMSOSVM and it never ends :(
 n4nd0	I am doing something wrong for sure
 _____________	change risk to call that, remove loss addition in risk
 uricamic	n4nd0: I haven't checked your code for HM-SVM yet, but wouldn't it be possible to just ass loss to the features in argmax?
 _____________	and then implement argmax_loss for multiclass and HM
 uricamic	n4nd0: which algorithm and what lambda have u tryied?
 uricamic	*tried
 n4nd0	uricamic: I have not set any algorithm explicitely to tell the truth
 uricamic	_____________: btw: I wanted to ask about the changes in my code for modular interfaces, because of java_modular failure
 uricamic	so it should use BMRM
 n4nd0	uricamic: I thought that would use BMRM by default
 _____________	I fixed that
 uricamic	that one has proven convergency
 n4nd0	uricamic: lamda equal to 0.01
 n4nd0	it doesn't finish though
 uricamic	I see, that could be the problem
 _____________	uricamic: do I understand right C is 1/lambda?
 uricamic	Like it goes through 1000 iterations and did not stop?
 _____________	uricamic: ah one ask for your code too
 _____________	could you please add !CSignal::cancel_computations() to while condition?
 n4nd0	uricamic: 294 iterations and it just froze
 uricamic	I guess not just 1/lambda, it depends on the formulation of the task with C, do you have it somewhere? I guess it could be n/lambda
 _____________	to make it possible to Ctrl+C that
 uricamic	froze?
 uricamic	hmm, that is strange
 uricamic	it might mean that the qp task is really hard to solve
 uricamic	and it could take really a long wjile
 uricamic	*while
 n4nd0	I am using the so_multiclass example, in libshogun
 uricamic	n4nd0: it does not converge for so_multiclass ?
 _____________	it was converging on my machine ehm
 _____________	very fast
 n4nd0	I am doing something wrong for sure then
 n4nd0	but what?
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/F6q9rrVS
 n4nd0	just find bundle to look for the parts that use bmrm
 uricamic	try to increase lambda
 uricamic	a lot
 uricamic	because, I probably haven't mentioned it anywhere yet
 uricamic	but because of P3BMRM
 uricamic	we are using unnormalized risk
 uricamic	i.e. without division by number of examples
 uricamic	which changes the lambda a lot
 n4nd0	to what number?
 uricamic	try something really big for start and then u can try lower
 n4nd0	trying with 1000
 uricamic	like 1e4
 uricamic	yep, or that one
 uricamic	the problem is that without this unnormalized risk, P3BMRM would not be identical to BMRM
 n4nd0	ok it finished now, thank you :)
 uricamic	it would require division of number of cp_models used depending also on the number of examples in the cp_model
 uricamic	n4nd0: you are welcome
 n4nd0	I get this accuracy
 n4nd0	SO-SVM: 82.80%
 n4nd0	BMRM:   69.90%
 n4nd0	is that normal?
 uricamic	but when using unnormalized risk, they are equal
 uricamic	could be, try lower lambda now :)
 n4nd0	model selection for this would be nice :D
 uricamic	I have finished benchamrk for MNIST data yesterday, but I will probably have to change my code a bit to be able to send it in PR
 uricamic	I mean  I need to return history of Fp, Fd and wdist from the solver, but in current form it crashes java_modular
 uricamic	so I guess, it will be sufficient to add getters for these to DualLibQPBMSOSVM class and everything should be fine then
 _____________	uricamic: it works now
 _____________	I believe it does
 uricamic	_____________: how come?  I guess it is impossible :)
 _____________	uricamic: you didn't declare constructor and it was not inherited from sgobject
 uricamic	because now in modular there is no support to return bmrm_return_T
 _____________	so I had to declare ctor/dtor and add dummy save/load_serializable
 _____________	I restored it
 uricamic	oh, I see
 _____________	just check latest
 uricamic	I haven't noticed it
 uricamic	ok, thanks, I will check it
 _____________	it was crashing python graphical example of multiclass
 _____________	but now it works without any glitches
 _____________	uricamic: could you implement a multiclass agrmax with loss?
 uricamic	_____________: I will look on it
 uricamic	so the design will be to have overloaded argmax one without loss and the other with it?
 n4nd0	I think that is the idea
 n4nd0	I'd like to skype with Nico first to ensure it
 _____________	yes
 _____________	I was pretty sure it would work without loss
 _____________	but okay if it is not I don't mind
 _____________	:)
 uricamic	well, I am still wondering that it was working, but it could happen :)
 uricamic	but I am sure, that the loss has to be there before argmax
 _____________	n4nd0 thought it is only because of simple cases
 _____________	I could believe so
 uricamic	yep, that is possible
 n4nd0	I am preparing this case for multiclass classification to compare
 _____________	http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m95fwdIEnn1qg3gfeo1_500.jpg hahah
 wiking	blackburn why u no break somebody else's code? :D
 n4nd0	lol
 _____________	man it is easy to apply that patch
 n4nd0	the lol was for the picture :D
 wiking	wtf man
 wiking	you broke the example :)
 _____________	how?
 wiking	i'll paste bt of gdb
 wiking	[DEBUG] entering LatentSVM::apply(LatentFeatures at 0x10260bd90)

 _____________	oh okay
 _____________	that can be let
 _____________	me fix it
 wiking	i'mjustaying
 _____________	wiking: well you are not very active with that code so I didn't think I could make it hard to rebase :)
 wiking	:)))
 _____________	all changes in your code are just
 _____________	apply -> apply_latent
 wiking	it doesn't mean that i'm not preparing a patch
 wiking	yeah i know
 n4nd0	uricamic: I don't manage to make so_multiclass_BMRM work properly
 _____________	that is the right way to do that so just rename it and you wouldn't really need to rebase
 wiking	and as well the fuckup of yesterday's primalmosek :)
 n4nd0	uricamic: I execute on command line ./so_multiclass_BMRM data.out 2 1000 500 1 0.01 BMRM
 uricamic	n4nd0: what do u mean properly?
 n4nd0	and it stays in iteration 0 forever
 wiking	i mean the only thing is that please commit if it compiles
 wiking	and not when it doesn't
 wiking	and not having mosek is not an excuse when u edit that code ;)
* wiking feeling bossy today :)

 n4nd0	_____________: I have to support wiking there, I am sorry :S
 uricamic	n4nd0: hmm,  I think I have changed that example to expect data in svmllight format
 uricamic	but let me check that
 n4nd0	uricamic: aaahm I am just using the data from the example I run
 uricamic	I am just compiling the latest code
 n4nd0	uricamic: ok, let me know someting
 _____________	well guys I have nothing to say if you are so worried with breaking your code :)
 n4nd0	:)
 wiking	:>
 n4nd0	I guess that we all want to rush a bit the things in order to be ready for release
 wiking	btw what has happened with fixing up the static analyzer problems?
 _____________	I have been waiting for generic risk function for a while and nobody did it
 uricamic	hmm, it seems that I have to modified that example, cos' it refused to compile now :D
 _____________	furthermore we had wrong interface with redundant features
 wiking	_____________: a PR + wait for comment would be nice... it really worked out for me till now quite well
 _____________	so having no mosek is excuse, it is not project of mine but I did that
 wiking	_____________: but you've broken the code, and you couldn't see the problem as that code never compiled on your machine
 n4nd0	uricamic: oh yes, you have to change the constructor
 wiking	DONT FUCKING BREAK THE CODE! :)
 n4nd0	uricamic: just leave out features
 n4nd0	uricamic: and thank _____________  :P
 uricamic	n4nd0: I see :D
 wiking	uricamic: :DDD
 _____________	wiking: I know what to do better
 wiking	_____________: u mean u know better? :)
 _____________	breaking mosek is not the issue when we are in rush to release sooner
 wiking	but then we have a broken release :)
 wiking	especially that mosek is not tested on any of the bots
 uricamic	n4nd0:  ok it works for me now
 n4nd0	_____________: we have to face that it will probably be difficult to have everything working with bundle methods for release
 wiking	i.e. nobody else will pick up this error just who really wants it to work :)
 _____________	n4nd0 will always test it because he works with it
 _____________	n4nd0: I can't see any difficult there
 _____________	you said HM argmax with loss is easy?
 wiking	ok i was mostly joking till now
 n4nd0	I didn't say it was easy
 n4nd0	I am just guessing
 _____________	so you can't do that?
 wiking	but seriously is it really hard to wait 6 hours for comments on a PR _____________ ?
 wiking	if yeas
 wiking	then mea culpa
 uricamic	n4nd0: so the input data are expected in svmlight format
 n4nd0	_____________: I didn't say I can't
 _____________	I have no fucking idea when will you appear wiking
 wiking	_____________: i dont have to appear to comment on a PR on githug
 _____________	what to wait for?
 n4nd0	_____________: I just say that maybe it cannot be done for today
 wiking	*github
 _____________	I will do that then
 uricamic	i.e. on each line first number is the label and then non-zero elements of feature vectors in format idx:value
 wiking	especially if you add a @<github username> into the comment
 wiking	as that person will get an email most probably
 wiking	as that's the default setting of github...
 _____________	wiking: what should I wait for?
 wiking	_____________: comment on your intended PR
 wiking	from the author of that actual code
 _____________	which PR?
 _____________	apply_latent?
 wiking	_____________: i'm talking about future
 wiking	that if u change code
 wiking	which u really dont feel sure about
 wiking	then maybe go with a PR and wait 3-6 hours
 _____________	in future I would never get you back
 _____________	what is unsure in that PR?
 wiking	and if there's no comment
 _____________	it should be apply_latent but not apply
 _____________	did you ever check how machine works?
 wiking	it's not about that given commit
 wiking	same goes with primal mosek per se
 wiking	and this is not a personal vendetta
 _____________	did you check logs where I asked n4nd0 to check if it compiles?
 wiking	so please do not start to patronize me with "did you ever check how machine works?"
 wiking	i'm just suggesting
 wiking	that maybe it would be better...
 wiking	but if you know better
 wiking	then it's ok
 _____________	should I spend time on installing mosek just to check if it compiles when I could ask n4nd0 and he don't mind to do that?
 wiking	sorry mate to bringing up this idea
 _____________	I do not understand what you do blame me about
 wiking	i dont blame u
 wiking	i'm just saying that it would be great that if you start changing code that you haven't authored and it's not really an obvious assertation
 wiking	then maybe it would be great that you somehow assure that it's ok
 _____________	what is not obvious? removing features or renaming apply to apply_latent?
 wiking	_____________: i've given there the example: not obvious = not an assertation
 _____________	you claim I do that - where did I something that needs an author comment?
 wiking	all these commits
 wiking	that actually broken something
 _____________	which these?
 wiking	see the mentioned ones above
 wiking	or now you really want to have sha-1 lines?
 wiking	i mean seriously you are now going to take this as a personal matter
 wiking	?
 _____________	your example should work now it is just a missed line
 wiking	because sorry mate i really like you so i rather just shut up
 _____________	I do not understand why making it correct is so much an issue for you
 _____________	yes because you are blaming me in things I didn't do
 _____________	I am spending time on things I am unsure you will spend on
 _____________	lately I have been fixing doc - wiking your code too - I don't know whether you would do that
 n4nd0	this conversation makes me sad :(
 _____________	as for your example I planned to run it later anywhay
 _____________	I just wanted to make your projects more suitable before release that is coming already
 wiking	ok 2 more questions: a) have you commited code that broke examples and compilation of primalmosek? (and you have your answer on your line of 'blaming you') b) why do you feel attacked here, i think this really a work matter and nothing personal? but anyhow if you feel in any ways offended, then i'm honestly sorry and let's just forget this... it's really not worth it...
 _____________	you are not in active development (at least it looks like that for me)
 _____________	a) yes, and fixed that after n4nd0's report
 _____________	b) because you are attacking me - pretty obvious
 _____________	n4nd0: can you finally assure wiking I didn't break your code without your participation at all?
 wiking	as said in b) and earlier it wasn't meant to be attacking at all just a suggestion what would be great...
 _____________	or you think too I am the breaker that makes your projects worse?
 wiking	dude
 wiking	you completely take this the wrong way
 wiking	nobody ever told that "I am the breaker"
 wiking	and that you are making the project worse
 wiking	you are taking this out of proportion
 wiking	i haven't told any of this
 n4nd0	uricamic, _____________ : nice! I finally finished the test
 uricamic	n4nd0: great :)
 wiking	and wasn't even nearly implying it...
 n4nd0	uricamic, _____________ : so I have compared the error when using the CMulticlassModel::risk and the error when using CStructuredModel::risk
 n4nd0	the same data, same epsilon, same lambda, everything the same except from that function
 n4nd0	when using CMulticlassModel::risk we get an error equal to 21.4%
 n4nd0	and when using the other around 40%
 n4nd0	_____________: so I finally conclude that bot argmax are not the same :)
 _____________	n4nd0: I don't mind that but just do that correct
 uricamic	n4nd0: yep, of course they can't be :)
 uricamic	I am going for lunch now, will be back hopefully in less than 1 hour
 n4nd0	uricamic: bye
 n4nd0	_____________: c'mon man, don't say it so :(
 _____________	how so?
 n4nd0	never mind
 _____________	I just mean if you have no time for that
 _____________	just tell me
 _____________	I will try to do by myself
 n4nd0	look _____________, I have time for that
 n4nd0	but time in my time frame
 n4nd0	I may have done it by the end of this week, tested and everything
 n4nd0	because first I want to consult with Nico
 n4nd0	if you do not like that ..... just do it yourself
 _____________	I want that to be in release I am sorry I am pushing you
 n4nd0	_____________: I will do my best then
 _____________	it seems to be the best new feature of shogun
 n4nd0	_____________: then I will get more motivation :)
 _____________	so I don't want to fuck up there
 n4nd0	all right
 _____________	so argmax is just viterbi in hm?
 n4nd0	yes
 _____________	can't you just put losses in that loss matrix?
 _____________	I am newbie in HM still but just ask
 n4nd0	let me check one thing in the hmsvm toolbox
 _____________	it is easy to implement for multiclass
 CIA-52	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r6d43e98 / src/shogun/features/DataGenerator.cpp : include lib/config.h when checking for a DEFINE_TO_BE_SET - http://git.io/cTCq-w
 _____________	really easy
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/KPkuwjta
 n4nd0	take a look to that code
 _____________	sonney2k: it is already included in .h - why?
 n4nd0	_____________: you can see there are two calls to best_path
 _____________	hah so it uses shogun's viterbi?
 n4nd0	in the past yes, not in that version
 _____________	lol
 _____________	because our HMM is broken
 _____________	and not because of me wiking
 n4nd0	I think it was just to make it standalone...
 n4nd0	at least they say so in the doc
 _____________	n4nd0: 59-64 lines are the thing, right?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	and that is actually what I do in my code
 n4nd0	I think that my argmax is looking for the MMV
 _____________	what is MMV?
 n4nd0	it is always doing the pred_path_mmv and not the pred_path
 n4nd0	maximal margin violater
 n4nd0	it appears in that snippet, in a comment
 wiking	_____________ as i said earlier i'm sorry that i've brought up this whole topic; it was completely unrespectful from me to say anything like that....
 _____________	ah right sure
 _____________	wiking: you are right in what you are saying
 _____________	but
 _____________	I didn't break someone code if it is not obvious fix
 _____________	or doc fix
 _____________	or I didn't talk to author
 _____________	obvious fix is your case
 _____________	in case of mosek svm I was in touch with n4nd0 - no idea why he refuses to say that :D
 n4nd0	because I do not agree in the way you are handling this
 n4nd0	but anyway ... let's move on, this is not so important
 _____________	okay one more guy against me
 _____________	so
 wiking	as i said it was my fault so i hope we can get over this
 n4nd0	_____________: you see, it is not against you or with you man
 wiking	JESUS
 _____________	why didn't you say I should install mosek and do not touch it yesterday?
 wiking	please
 n4nd0	_____________: I don't know how you say that if I am not even taking part ....
 _____________	you said okay I will compile'
 _____________	didn't you say that?
-!- emrecelikten [~emre@trir-5d8000e4.pool.mediaWays.net] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	all right guys
 wiking	let's just get over this and i'm sorry for bringing this up
 wiking	it's not worth any of this
 n4nd0	sonney2k: captain, bring some peace please :)
 _____________	I give up guys
 wiking	_____________ there's nothing to give up, keep on as is and it's all good
 _____________	let you work on that separetely then if you are so hurted
-!- emrecelikten [~emre@trir-5d8000e4.pool.mediaWays.net] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 wiking	_____________ nobody is hurt here....
 wiking	except maybe you
 _____________	with commits I have to do without much checks
 wiking	but that wasn't any of my intention
 wiking	and since it escalated into this that you think i'm saying that you are makeing bad for the project
 wiking	which is OBVIOUSLY not the case... it's the opposite
 wiking	you are pushing this project like nobody else here
 wiking	which is awesome
 n4nd0	+1
 wiking	so please just try to forget my comments and https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/6/17/u5J1lVbU6UabQ5QinFqv0A2.jpg
 _____________	I partly do understand your unsatisfaction
 _____________	but I do not understand what made you so worried about that
 wiking	neither of that has happened in me :)
 wiking	neither unsatisfaction nor worried
 wiking	it was really just a comment
 wiking	no more no less
 wiking	and u do whatever you want with it
 wiking	just please dont take it as a personal vendetta against you and your personality
 _____________	n4nd0: why didn't you say it is bad to do that blind fix?
 _____________	and why do you feel it so bad if you could test that - as I asked you
 _____________	I do not understand that
 wiking	nyipp
 n4nd0	_____________: I think I told you I could fix the MOSEK thing to ensure that it will compile, but you insisted
 _____________	?????
 wiking	*booom* and the last 20 minutes disappeared :DDD
 wiking	nonono
 n4nd0	I don't think it is bad to the blind fix either
 wiking	llalalalal
 wiking	lalal
 wiking	a
 _____________	insisted what?
 wiking	alalalal
 wiking	aa
 n4nd0	bad sounds quite bad
 wiking	alalla
 wiking	alala
 wiking	lalalala
 wiking	lalalalal
 wiking	ala
 wiking	ala
 _____________	I wanted you to test if it compiles after removing features
 wiking	(do not let you speeak :DDD )
 _____________	is that wrong for you?
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	of course not
 _____________	what is?
 n4nd0	?
 _____________	I want to understand what is you feel wrong in handling
 _____________	you said you disagree
 _____________	with what?
 n4nd0	how you have reacted
 n4nd0	but it was nothing bad
 wiking	have i told that ever since a chick moved into my office my office became a geek magnet and all the guys are coming into my office chatting... :))
 n4nd0	:D
 wiking	i'll be a true cockblocker :)
 n4nd0	haha
 wiking	i still need to work on some lines :)
 n4nd0	_____________: seriously, I don't think you did wrong doing any fix there
 _____________	then I am completely lost what I am wrong with
 wiking	_____________: nothing!
 wiking	that's the point :)
 wiking	and i was just practicing my trolling skills :D
 _____________	I understand you are comfortable with your own code and it is rather you should do changes
 _____________	but it would take a while and I want to push latest must have features before release
 _____________	and make it correct
 n4nd0	_____________: agree
 wiking	so is it over yet?
 n4nd0	let's work together and have as many stable things as possible before release
 _____________	I'll let you polish your code by yourselves then
 _____________	wiking: so is your example worknig now?
 wiking	_____________ yeah awesom-ooo-ly thnx!
 _____________	wiking: why latentsosvm has training but has no apply?
 wiking	_____________ because it's WIP
 wiking	it'll be no WIP by this weekend
 _____________	I see
 wiking	we have this 'little' ongoing problem with structmodel and latentmodel and merging them
 wiking	as currently creating a working latentSOSVM
 wiking	takes too much user defined stuff
 wiking	you have to define at least 4 different classes
 wiking	and i think we shoudl take it down to 3
 _____________	ok
 _____________	I am sorry I am a bit offensive but I still don't really get why did you both blame me
 wiking	I BLAME YOU FOR MISUNDERSTANDING ME!
 wiking	u r the MISUNDERSTANDER!
 wiking	:D
 wiking	do not be that one :>
 wiking	comeon man seriously
 wiking	can we get over it?
 _____________	yes but I want you to understand I am not a psycho
 wiking	heheh i know you are not
 wiking	:D
 wiking	never was the case
 wiking	you are just passionate about shogun
 wiking	that would make you a geek but i would really like to think that you are not that type of a geek who would come into my office to try to chat with this chick :)))
 n4nd0	:D
 _____________	it is hard to talk about structured output machine with chick
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	i hope they won't find these chat logs
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	or maybe i hope they'll find it :DD
 _____________	I am sure no chick would ever try to read IRC LOG of MACHINE LEARNING TOOLBOX, I am pretty sure
* wiking works at a very unpleasant place so that's why his implied complaning :)
 _____________	which office you are talking about? your university?
 wiking	heheheh she is doing phd in maths...
 wiking	i mean it's not soooo unprobable
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	yeah my uni :)
 wiking	ah yeah cool
 wiking	i know how i'll cockblock
 wiking	i'll use banners
 wiking	:D
 wiking	i'll print some banners and just raise them sometimes when i get annoyed with the jibberish :)
 n4nd0	_____________: I think that the argmax I implemented does: argmax_y [ Delta(yi,y) + <w, Psi(xi,y)> ] in training
 n4nd0	_____________: and argmax_y [ <w, Psi(xi,y)> ] during prediction
 wiking	n4nd0: it should do that yes
 _____________	lol
 wiking	so if you have some good ideas for the banners let me know :)
 n4nd0	wiking: but the definition of argmax is: y* = argmax_y <w, psi(xi,y)> or?
 wiking	n4nd0: well that's the thing
 _____________	n4nd0: can't we assume training is for +LOSS and not-training is w/o loss?
 n4nd0	_____________: do you mean for every model, or just for HM-SVM?
 wiking	n4nd0: it should be that in your case but i think you are trying to find the most violating ones
 _____________	for all models
 n4nd0	_____________: I am not sure about all models
 n4nd0	_____________: let me check what I did in the multiclass one
 wiking	not-training w/o loss?
 wiking	no comply in me please explain
 _____________	wiking: there are two modes in argmax
 _____________	first is training one
 n4nd0	_____________: in the multiclass the loss is not taking into account
 _____________	n4nd0: we should change that then
 wiking	but classification (not-training?) is just w*psi(x,y)
 _____________	n4nd0: okay wait - so HM is correct because it was correct alreadY?
 _____________	wiking: yes
 n4nd0	_____________: why? I don't know which one is the correct :D
 n4nd0	wiking: yes
 _____________	n4nd0: you said it does loss+w max
 wiking	so what else is not-training? :)))
 n4nd0	prediction
 _____________	exactly
 wiking	well then u don't need that
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	when you don't have the true label, you cannot get the loss
 wiking	it's just w*psi()
 _____________	no, it is argmax of w*psi
 wiking	really?
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	i get it
 _____________	most probable label
 wiking	or i would get it in latent case
 wiking	but in simple struct as well?
 n4nd0	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/tsochantaridis_etal_04a.pdf
 n4nd0	look guys at algorithm 1
 n4nd0	oh shit I am getting crazy confused
 _____________	what to do with it?
 _____________	n4nd0: if you are optimizing with loss term already
 _____________	lets just remove it from generic risk
 _____________	and put loss to multiclass argmax on training=true
 n4nd0	I don't understand, sorry
 _____________	n4nd0: you said you compute argmax with loss already, right?
 n4nd0	in the HM-SVM
 _____________	yes
 n4nd0	not in the multiclass
 _____________	we can fix multiclass - it is not the issue
 _____________	I mean currently it is being added to risk
 _____________	in generic risk
 _____________	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/structure/StructuredModel.cpp line 170
 _____________	n4nd0: if we assume argmax includes loss on training we remove line 170
 _____________	and add loss to multiclass
 _____________	then everything becomes correct and we are all happy
 n4nd0	the thing is that I am not sure whether the argmax should include the loss
 n4nd0	even if we are in training
 _____________	ehm
 _____________	you was sure yesterday
 _____________	and uricamic said it should
 _____________	I was unsure it should
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	well risk is being used in bmrm code
 _____________	okay I am off for food
 wiking	and there the primal objective in some way will include using argmax
 wiking	alas the risk
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	_____________: yesterday I was sure that the argmax doesn't include the loss
 n4nd0	_____________: that's why I said that it is not the same the argmax that was already implemented in the model than the one we need for risk
 wiking	n4nd0 what i dont get is that how u want to have a generic risk, where what the bmrm solves is actually labmda*||w|| + RISK
 wiking	so it pretty much depends on you what RISK -> p.o. is
 n4nd0	but the risk can be written in terms of an argmax and the psi function
 wiking	well it depends what's RISK's form
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	so the generic risk calls these model dependent functions
 wiking	yeah i get it
 wiking	but the risk can be pretty much anything
 wiking	:)
 wiking	or?
 n4nd0	R({\bf w}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left[ \ell(y_i, y) + \langle {\bf w}, \Psi(x_i, y) - \Psi(x_i, y_i)  \rangle  \right]
 wiking	until it's convex... ;)
 n4nd0	I thought the risk is that, and only that
 wiking	this is from multiclass right/
 wiking	?
 n4nd0	(paste here for better reading)
 n4nd0	http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php
 wiking	i know this one
 n4nd0	wiking: why just the multiclass one?
 wiking	but from where did you get this comment?
 n4nd0	MuticlassModel.h
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	afaik it's a good risk function for multiclass
 n4nd0	it is the same that appears in Teo
 wiking	yeah i know :)
 n4nd0	page 103, equation A.2
 wiking	and a lot of other places with SO
 n4nd0	they don't talk there just about multiclass, right?
 wiking	noup
 wiking	wait a sec
 wiking	wait
 wiking	i'll just dig something out
 wiking	ok so here's another thing
 wiking	hahahah A FUCKING GEEK CAME TO MY ROOM BUT SINCE SHE IS NOT HERE HE DIDNT EVEN ENTER THE ROOM
 wiking	how fucking lame is this :)))
 wiking	they all want the pussy :)))
 wiking	so yeah n4nd0 look
 n4nd0	:D
 wiking	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cnyu/papers/icml09_latentssvm.pdf
 wiking	page 3 eq(7)
 wiking	for me that is the RISK
 wiking	with the -C\sum_....
 wiking	the whole thing after 1/2||w||
 n4nd0	aham
 n4nd0	yeah, that is definitely different
 n4nd0	that term is new
 wiking	and the Dual solver
 wiking	basically is intented to solve
 wiking	anything that is convex and in labmda*||w||^@ + RISK
 wiking	w/o constraints
 wiking	so
 wiking	until risk is convex
 wiking	you can have anything
 wiking	as risk
 n4nd0	I see
 wiking	this is my understanding and that's why i thought that StructuredModel::risk should not be implemented
 wiking	n4nd0: but in multiclass case
 wiking	you are totally right though
 wiking	you can actually define the risk function with the help of psi and argmax
 wiking	but what if is your risk is something completely different but still convex
 wiking	see for example my case
 n4nd0	but maybe this risk function we use in multiclass, and probably in HM-SVM too, may work as well
 wiking	and yes in my case \hat{y} and \hat{h} should be defined/given by argmax
 wiking	yeah it will work
 wiking	until you want that risk function
 n4nd0	then we just make it virtual
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	but i think you should note it somewhere that this is just an example ;)
 n4nd0	giving the possibility to be overridden
 wiking	yeah as until now
 n4nd0	wiking: sure
 n4nd0	in any case
 n4nd0	probably it is not that great to have this generic risk for efficiency reasons
 wiking	but i thought that it's a bit 'narrowing down' when you already implement a risk function in an abstract class whilst your risk function could be anything
 wiking	anything = the PO is convex...
 n4nd0	yes, I see your point and I agree with you
 wiking	but
 n4nd0	it is not conceptually right I think
 wiking	there could be a protected default risk function ?:)
 wiking	in structuredmodel
 wiking	and then anybody who inherits from this class
 wiking	will have already a function at hand
 wiking	and he can just chuck that in into his risk function
 wiking	(call it from it) if he really doesn't know what is he doing :)))
 n4nd0	sounds like a good idea
 wiking	or just wants to compare
 wiking	bmrm vs mosek
 wiking	btw have any of you run that ?
 wiking	what's the accuracy difference between mosek and bmrm
 wiking	on one given data set
 n4nd0	not using an important data set
 wiking	hehe yeah
 n4nd0	just randomly generated Gaussian
 wiking	but any dataset
 wiking	yeah
 n4nd0	for the multiclass example
 wiking	and what are the numbers?
 n4nd0	yeah, I have prepared that before
 wiking	how far r they from each other ?
 n4nd0	running again right now ..
 n4nd0	but I don't think these results are very trustworthy
 n4nd0	I just plugged a lambda at random
 n4nd0	SO-SVM: 92.60%
 n4nd0	BMRM:   88.60%
 n4nd0	MC:     40.00%
 wiking	okey
 wiking	so bmrm is not so far at all
 wiking	btw: labmda = 1/c
 n4nd0	no
 wiking	what's your c in primal?
 wiking	just use lambda = 1/c
 n4nd0	wiking: michal said something about that BUT also that he was not regularizing with the #examples
 n4nd0	C = 1 in multiclass classification her
 wiking	but it's pretty cool though
 n4nd0	for the PrimalMosekSOSVM
 wiking	and for mosek?
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	then use lambda =1
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	I am interested in knowing how faster it is
 wiking	n4nd0: CMath::time
 wiking	:P
 wiking	but still it's awesome that there's bmrm that can actually give similar values as mosek but it's fully opensource
 n4nd0	it is pretty slow with lambda = 1

 wiking	:D
 wiking	ok i'm off to pick up something to eat
 n4nd0	lol
 wiking	brb in 10
 n4nd0	for a new run with other data and lambda = 1000 (#examples)
 n4nd0	SO-SVM: 85.30%

 uricamic	back again, I had to read quite a big log :)
 uricamic	so for the argmax question
 uricamic	I said, that it is reasonable to have overloaded argmax function, which in training will get loss and therefore it will find the most violated constraint
 uricamic	and the standard argmax function which should be used for prediction of with trained W vector
 _____________	uricamic: should it argmax including loss?
 uricamic	only in training
 _____________	n4nd0: what is MC?
 _____________	uricamic: sure
 _____________	uricamic: my suggestion is
 _____________	there is a training flag in argmax
 uricamic	but then for predictions it shouldn't use it
 uricamic	_____________: ok
 _____________	in case of training it includes loss
 n4nd0	_____________: linearMulticlassMachine with LibLinear
 _____________	in other cases no
 n4nd0	_____________: see libshogun/so_multiclass.cpp
 _____________	uricamic: good for you?
 uricamic	_____________: ok, that should be fine then
 uricamic	yep
 _____________	n4nd0: agree?
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	then I had not fucking idea what the argmax should do
 n4nd0	I feel stupid
 _____________	ehhm I do not understand
 _____________	I was wrong not you
 uricamic	because then it fits the design and it is easy to understand what is going on there
 n4nd0	_____________: I thought the loss is not included in the argmax
 _____________	?????
 n4nd0	so uricamic
 _____________	what we were arguing about last night?
 _____________	:D
 n4nd0	uricamic: can you please check MulticlassModel.cpp
 uricamic	argmax should do exactly what the name says - find argument where the dot product is maximal
 _____________	I was pretty sure my position is that argmax with loss is equal to argmax without
 _____________	but it was wrong
 n4nd0	_____________: yeah, but I am not talking about that
 n4nd0	I thought that the argmax must not include the loss
 _____________	to score?
 uricamic	and in training it has to find this maximum enhanced with losses -> i.e. find the most violated example
 n4nd0	I understand
 uricamic	n4nd0: the version which now in shogun or somewhere else?
 CIA-52	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r50ba31c / src/shogun/structure/StructuredModel.cpp : Removed redundant loss in generic risk - http://git.io/wcQu-w
 n4nd0	uricamic: let me paste it for you
 uricamic	n4nd0: ok
 n4nd0	http://pastebin.com/iK0xxBf1
 n4nd0	that is used for training currently
 n4nd0	and if I understand everything properly now
 n4nd0	that is kind of wrong
 n4nd0	since for training
 n4nd0	the score should be
 _____________	n4nd0: uricamic so should we add return_value->delta in risk?
 n4nd0	uricamic: what is computed in that snippet in line 8 + the loss
 _____________	n4nd0: yes it is wrong
 _____________	it is not wrong for *applying*
 _____________	but it is wrong for *training*
 uricamic	n4nd0: I miss the loss there
 n4nd0	uricamic: exactly
 _____________	uricamic: n4nd0 only in case of training right?
 n4nd0	_____________: I believe so
 _____________	I can fix that
 uricamic	it is ok for prediction but for training u have to add loss there to find the maximum score on features with loss
 _____________	or anybody is willing to?
 n4nd0	_____________: I can do it
 _____________	okay please do then
 n4nd0	uricamic: should we expect better classification results after this change?
 _____________	n4nd0: I am unsure we need delta parameter in result type
 n4nd0	_____________: that was designed by Nico
 _____________	if it is being added in case of training to score
 _____________	we won't use it anyway
 uricamic	n4nd0: well I would expect that, because if you haven't counted with loss in training u actually trained different classifier
 _____________	agree?
 n4nd0	_____________: I am not sure if it is used somewhere right now
 n4nd0	_____________: did you check?
 uricamic	_____________: what do u mean by resturn_value->delta?
 _____________	it is being set but it won't be used by risk
 uricamic	*return_value
 _____________	because score contains it
 _____________	uricamic: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/src/shogun/structure/MulticlassModel.cpp 109
 _____________	we don't need it, right?
 uricamic	probably not
 _____________	because we don't need in when applying
 _____________	it*
 _____________	and it is included when training
 _____________	n4nd0: agree?
 n4nd0	I wouldn't remove it right away
 n4nd0	I guess Nico put it there for some reason
 n4nd0	but no idea
 _____________	okay no need to remove it
 _____________	but lets remove it's setting in multiclass model
 _____________	okay I'll wait for your code :)
 _____________	n4nd0: we may do that with delta though
 _____________	n4nd0: we then would need to add it in risk function but subtract from maximum score
 _____________	see what I mean?
 wiking	n4nd0: just a little bit of comment on CStructuredModel. dont u wanna pass const SGVector<float64_t>& w in argmax?
 wiking	n4nd0: just to reserve some space on the heap
 wiking	i mean stack
 wiking	;)
 wiking	otherwise copy constructor is being called etc etc etc
 _____________	please do that somebody
 _____________	or I will
 _____________	:D
 wiking	and actually
 wiking	in risk function
 _____________	what is in risk function?
 wiking	don't we want to use SGVector<float64_t> instead of the simple pointers?
 _____________	where?
 wiking	float64_t risk(float64_t* subgrad, float64_t* W, TMultipleCPinfo* info=0);
 wiking	float64_t* -> SGVector
 _____________	why to use it?
 _____________	we could but any specific reason?
 wiking	since we have sgvector as a wrapper for simple type arrays
 wiking	no other reason
 _____________	wiking: to make it explicit I would keep it
 _____________	it makes you think you are going to write to given memory
 _____________	we need to add director model before release
 _____________	I will do that
 _____________	oops I am at job
 _____________	damn
 wiking	_____________: working again?
 _____________	yes starting from this week
 wiking	same place?
 _____________	yes
 _____________	netcracker
 _____________	it is worth to mention that netcracker supports shogun implicitly :D
 wiking	\o/
 wiking	put it in the release notes :>
 _____________	because I do shogun instead of my job
 _____________	:D
 wiking	(got that part ;P)
 wiking	n4nd0: wtf is with CLatentData CData and CStructedData?
 n4nd0	wiking: you talkead with sonney2k about that right?
 n4nd0	he didn't like CData I think
 n4nd0	uricamic: does BMRM use argmax somewhere?
 _____________	n4nd0: ?? risk
 uricamic	BMRM uses risk function, and risk function should use argmax inside
 n4nd0	call directly to argmax
 wiking	n4nd0: i remember sonney2k telling us that he doesn't like the naming... that was as far as i understood :)
 wiking	n4nd0: that's why i'm asking to what now?
 wiking	_____________: dont u wanna fix this? :)
 n4nd0	wiking: I don't know ... I am ok with anything regarding that to tell the truth :)
 wiking	and i'm TOOTALy not being ironic here :)
 _____________	wiking: fix what?
 wiking	as much as it sounds :>
 wiking	_____________: so that we have this shit going on
 wiking	_____________: we have CLatentData (actually we had now it's CData) and CStructuredData
 wiking	and basically they are serving the same exact purpose
 n4nd0	uricamic, _____________: so ... the accuracy doesn't change at all in this multiclass example
 n4nd0	_____________, uricamic: training with argmax using or not using loss
 uricamic	you mean with argmax containing losses in training?
 wiking	_____________: so i thought it would be great to remove this redundancy and merge CLatentData and CStructuredData and just have CData
 uricamic	:)
 wiking	_____________: but sonney2k didn't like the name
 wiking	_____________ so we need a new name and that's it basically ;)
 _____________	n4nd0: it might be for multiclass (as far as I understand)
 _____________	wiking: why latent is not structureD?
 wiking	_____________ because it's not :)
 n4nd0	uricamic: yes
 uricamic	n4nd0:  but it could be true just for some particular example, definitely not generally
 n4nd0	uricamic: ok
 wiking	i mean they are semantically not the same
 _____________	wiking: what is different in latent?
 n4nd0	uricamic: I am using also loss equal to 1 or 0 so it might normal that it doesn't make a huge difference
 wiking	_____________: that it's latent and not fixed contrary to structured
 wiking	_____________: other than that it's the exact same implementation :)
 uricamic	n4nd0: yep, that is another important fact
 wiking	_____________: it's just semantics
 wiking	_____________: but imho important one...
 uricamic	when u use e.g. L2 loss the difference should be more obvious
 _____________	wiking: okay lets get back to that later
 n4nd0	uricamic: it converges faster including the loss though, for the PrimalMosekSOSVM case
 _____________	n4nd0: what did you change now?
 uricamic	n4nd0: you mean less number of iterations?
 n4nd0	I am just comparing what happens when the argmax includes the loss or not
 n4nd0	uricamic: I am just looking at the training time
 n4nd0	uricamic: but I guess it is because the number of iterations is smaller
 uricamic	n4nd0: I see, but it should be reasonable since without loss it could happen that sometimes not true most violated constraint is found and therefore it needs more iterations to converge
 n4nd0	uricamic: yeah, could be
 wiking	_____________: http://i.imgur.com/zQHv4.gif
 wiking	:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 n4nd0	uricamic: you are an expert in this man!
 wiking	megalol
 wiking	:>
 uricamic	n4nd0: :D I wouldn't call myself one, but I have already written one paper about that
 uricamic	actually 2 but unfortunately the second one was not accepted, since someone has already done something similar -> axed by reviewers immedeately
 n4nd0	too bad
 uricamic	it is life :)
 n4nd0	uricamic: btw, I would really really prefer if the MulticlassModel::risk calls to argmax and delta loss
 n4nd0	uricamic: what do you think?
 uricamic	n4nd0: sure, it is no problem
 uricamic	I will get to this hopefully soon
 n4nd0	uricamic: do you want to change that?
 uricamic	n4nd0: yep I can, but if u want to do that feel free :)
 uricamic	since I have to write TR for my work which could be then referenced by shogun tutorial
 n4nd0	I think I am going to stop soon of shoguning today ...
 n4nd0	I should have done something for the job this morning
 _____________	wiking: yes that made all russian twitter day yesterdday
 _____________	n4nd0: uricamic where did you stop?
 _____________	is it ok to include loss in multiclass now?
 _____________	can I commit that?
 uricamic	_____________: you mean loss in multiclass argmax?
 _____________	yes
 uricamic	_____________: then yep
 _____________	if nobody of you are willing to do that I'll do
 _____________	:)
 _____________	n4nd0: job?
 n4nd0	_____________: yeah
 n4nd0	my professor at KTH gave me some things to do to help out in the robotics course this year too :)
 _____________	teaching is great
 n4nd0	he didn't tell me if he needs me in the lab this year too, for the moment I am just setting up some material
 n4nd0	so to sum up
 n4nd0	now both Multiclass and HM-SVM should work good with BMRM methods
 n4nd0	uricamic, _____________: agree?
 _____________	n4nd0: well
 _____________	if HM-SVM argmaxes with loss
 _____________	does it?
 n4nd0	yes
 _____________	okay nice
 _____________	then yes, but multiclass needs to be changed
 _____________	n4nd0: does structure_hmsvm_bmrm.py produce 99% still with latest changes?
 n4nd0	it is changed
 _____________	changed where?
 _____________	by you - you mean?
 _____________	if so let me merge it ;)
 n4nd0	PR going
 n4nd0	python structure_hmsvm_bmrm.py
 n4nd0	Accuracy = 0.9989
 _____________	I ask because I removed loss from risk
 _____________	I assume it is correct and score includes it
 _____________	right?
 n4nd0	let me think about it a moment
 n4nd0	but I think one term needs to be substracted from the risk
 n4nd0	psi_truth in particular
 _____________	yes
 _____________	multiclass has that problem
 n4nd0	well not just psi truth
 n4nd0	but <w, psi(xi,yi)>
 _____________	yes
 _____________	is it true for HMModel too?
 n4nd0	I am not sure for that
 n4nd0	for example
 n4nd0	I don't see directly that the score in the HMMModel includes the loss
 n4nd0	although it may be since a matrix used for Viterbi decoding includes the loss term...
 n4nd0	I am not sure regarding this
 n4nd0	I will ask Nico about it tomorrow
 n4nd0	or maybe uricamic can tell us about it
 _____________	n4nd0: why did you make first -INFTY?
 _____________	this way you disallow it to select 0th class
 _____________	if you do it this way then c=0 initially
-!- av3ngr [av3ngr@nat/redhat/x-swaimdyxogxxwdlk] has quit [Quit: That's all folks!]
 n4nd0	mmm but that is weird
 n4nd0	the accuracy remained the same after that fix
 n4nd0	yeah of course it'd remain the same if I don't compile ....
 wiking	n4nd0: you talking to me? (c) ?
 uricamic	n4nd0: sorry, I have been away for a while, what is the question?

 wiking	buuut i could use that for temp time
 wiking	they put 1000 tars within that big tar
 wiking	i think the 1000 tars is the different classes

 blackburn	time to fix things
 uricamic	blackburn: btw I have checked IRC log, BMRM cannot be used with lambda=0
 blackburn	uricamic: sure
 blackburn	that's clear
 uricamic	and also, it should not be even close to 0
 blackburn	well it converges with small lambda
 blackburn	but it makes no sense
 blackburn	it is just overfitting
 uricamic	blackburn: yep, I just wanted to point that out just for sure :)
 blackburn	the only reason I did that
 blackburn	to try to fit model perfectly
 blackburn	on training data
 blackburn	with no regularization at all
 uricamic	well, it can happen that for some instance and features the regularization term is not needed, by then it is not good idea to use BMRM
 uricamic	blackburn: I see, but BMRM is not designed for such things, lambda has to be >0
 blackburn	uricamic: btw multiclass model is not typical in bmrm, right?
 blackburn	I mean it is L2 of whole w
 uricamic	I am not sure that I understand the question now
 blackburn	ahhh nevermind
 blackburn	it is ||w||^2 so it is the same
 blackburn	I meant that in crammer-singer or weston one
 blackburn	\sum ||w|| is used
 uricamic	you mean the way how it is implemented in shogun now?
 blackburn	but it is the same in cases of ||w||^2
 uricamic	I see
 blackburn	read ^ as \sum ||w_i||^2
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn	uricamic: so are we ok now with multiclass bmrm?
 blackburn	uricamic: btw what is the difference between all these solvers?
 uricamic	I will check multiclass bmrm, soon, but I guess it should be ok now
 uricamic	the difference
 uricamic	BMRM is the standard method as described by Teo et al.
 uricamic	only the inactive cutting plane (ICP) removal strategy is added there
 blackburn	how one should choose a solver?
 uricamic	PPBMRM is BMRM enhanced by prox-term
 blackburn	kind of initial guess?
 uricamic	which is our method how to enforce possibility of some initial solution by restricting the L2 distance between consecutive W_t
 blackburn	our - your and vojta?
 uricamic	and the last one P3BMRM is the same  as PPBMRM plus it can use multiple cutting plane models, it is similar to Joachim's nslack
 uricamic	yep
 uricamic	when cp_models = 1 in P3BMRM then it is reduced to PPBMRM
 uricamic	and when you set K = 0 PPBMRM should reduce back to BMRM (but I haven't checked this particular one yet)
 blackburn	we have to make your example support default values
 uricamic	I mean in Shogun's implementation
 uricamic	you mean cpp example?
 blackburn	yes
 uricamic	ok, I put it there just for my convenience to test all algorithms quickly
 blackburn	I don't mind command line commands actually
 blackburn	but we need it able to run as is
 uricamic	like ./so_multiclass_BMRM and that's all?
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	Makefile does that
 blackburn	when testing
 uricamic	i.e. to use randomly generated data and default settings
 uricamic	ok
 blackburn	yeah that would work I think
 blackburn	can you do that next time?
 uricamic	sure
 blackburn	the earlier the better because currently test is broken: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/352/steps/test%20libshogun/logs/stdio
 uricamic	I think I will do this either in the evening or tomorrow
 uricamic	ahh, ok
 uricamic	so back to the solvers, if u are tuning the optimal lambda, it is nice to have some reasonable range of lambda's and in the cycle use PPBMRM or P3BMRM, since then it will use solution from the last lambda as initial one and converges much faster, especially for lower values of lambda
 uricamic	to put it in numbers, on MNIST data (10 classes, 784 feature dimension), 60k training examples
 uricamic	the difference between BMRM and P3BMRM on lambda=1
 blackburn	kind of hot start?
 uricamic	yep
 blackburn	nice
 uricamic	was from 2.01 hours to 2.09 hours for P3BMRM
 uricamic	shit
 uricamic	0.209 for P3BMRM :D
 uricamic	otherwise it would be so impressive :D
 uricamic	oh, again, wouldn't :D
 blackburn	2 hrs?
 blackburn	:D
 uricamic	in iterations it was from 5932 iterations to 408
 blackburn	uricamic: 0.209h sounds like it is pretty fast, something near to liblinear
 uricamic	and the other thing about P3BMRM is that it could be quite easily written to use more cores
 uricamic	blackburn: I haven't tried liblinear yet :)
 uricamic	but this multicore thing has probably reason only when computation of the risk takes a long time
 blackburn	I see
 uricamic	so in multiclass it would probably not give any speedup at all
 blackburn	that's clear
 uricamic	another thing is that both PPBMRM and P3BMRM tends to converge to more precise solution than BMRM because of our alpha setting strategy and termination condition
 blackburn	last two weeks I've been trying to employ L1/L2 tree regularization
 blackburn	no success :(

 wiking	blackburn1: we were in a split
 blackburn1	hehe
 wiking	so any ideas there?
 blackburn1	about??
 wiking	ah the func arg
 wiking	have you got my two example cases for diff dims?
 wiking	http://pastebin.com/VhXVs7qF and http://pastebin.com/p3EFtZdf
 wiking	are two actual applications
 blackburn1	this is *not* different dims case
 blackburn1	just like in multiclass it is just sparse
 wiking	blackburn1: noup http://pastebin.com/p3EFtZdf
 wiking	check this one
 wiking	score += sm->w[cur_class*sparm->size_hog+i+1]*hog[i];
 wiking	w = num_class*sparm->size_hog
 blackburn1	it is just multiclass hog
 wiking	i mean the dimension of w
 wiking	otherwise the indexing would not work
 blackburn1	dimension is W is always equal to dimension of Psi, but Psi can be sparse
 blackburn1	that is the case
 blackburn1	and multiclass is the case
 wiking	ano
 wiking	no
 wiking	ok
 wiking	u r right
 blackburn1	dimension of Psi here is not equal to dimension of hog
 blackburn1	it is dim of hog * n_classes
 blackburn1	but everything out given class is 0
 blackburn1	so it is not computed at all
 wiking	my bad
 wiking	sorry
 blackburn1	actually if you have that code HOGSO Model is straightforward
 wiking	mmm now i'm in trouble...
 wiking	i need to calculate this for all examples: argmax_{(ybar,hbar)} [<w,psi(x,ybar,hbar)> + loss(y,ybar,hbar)].
 wiking	and i want to keep the COFFIN fw
 blackburn1	line 25 is a dense dot
 blackburn1	wiking: it is argmax alreadyy
 wiking	which?
 wiking	i mean now i'm writing a generic implementation i'm not talking about those pastebins
 wiking	it's just that currnetly i have 1 method for psi
 wiking	is that CDotFeatures* get_psi....()
 wiking	i guess i could generate all the different CDotFeatures and generate a matrix of the w,psi(x,ybar,hbar)> + loss(y,ybar,hbar) values
 wiking	and do there a max value search for each row/column (depending on who do i store [w,psi(x,ybar,hbar)> + loss(y,ybar,hbar)]) and then sum it up
 wiking	:)
 wiking	it's just a lot of memory waste...
 wiking	blackburn1: input?
 blackburn1	yeah sounds inefficient
 wiking	but i dont have something like SGVector<float64_t> get_psi(x,y,h)
 wiking	as sparse vector wouldn't work then
 blackburn1	why don't you have it?
 wiking	because i couldn't have sparse vector
 wiking	this is why i threw out the first place the get_psi(x,y,h) and have only CDotFeatures* get_psi_vectors()
 blackburn1	I see

 n4nd0	any clue why that crash is happening in Arthur's question?
 n4nd0	mailing list
 wiking	n4nd0: swig version could be a possible problem
 wiking	i mean i have 2.0.8
 wiking	1.3.29 seems a bit old
 n4nd0	wiking: that's true
 n4nd0	wiking: should I answer him or do you want to do it?
 wiking	mmm i think that should be tested though
 wiking	and if that's the case then we should find the minimum swig version shogun requires to be able to compile the modular interfaces
 wiking	the problem is that i have 0 knowledge about swig
 wiking	i think gsomix would be the most competent to say anything about this
 n4nd0	wiking: I remember once my compilation failed and sonney2k told me to update swig
 n4nd0	it worked after that
 n4nd0	I will just tell him in case it can solve his problem
@sonney2k	n4nd0, wiking yes we need newer swig - but IIRC configure should fail if swig < 2.0.4
 wiking	yeah the problem is i think that he would need to manually install a new version of swig as he now uses the standard distrib supplied swig
 wiking	ooh yeah
 n4nd0	I could do it via apt-get easily
 wiking	_swig_version=`${SWIG} -version 2>/dev/null | grep Version | cut -f 3 -d ' '`
 wiking	if assert_version swig $_swig $_swig_version 2.0.4; then
 wiking	echores "$_swig_version"
 wiking	_swig=yes
 wiking	n4nd0: it's RH :)
 n4nd0	wiking: RH?
 wiking	redhat
 wiking	according to his email he uses redhat => no apt-get ;P
 wiking	lol his configure log is
 wiking	============ Checking for SWIG ============
 wiking	Result is: 1.3.29
 wiking	##########################################
 wiking	and the assert_version doesn't fail
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.168.13.61] has joined #shogun
 wiking	so there's something wrong with that if line
 blackburn	discussing swig issue? I have to note he is using 1.1.0
 blackburn	I do not remember if it requires >2.0 but probably it does
 wiking	blackburn: just joined 1 minute later
 wiking	blackburn: yeah accoding to ./configure script it should actually fail because it's not 2.0.4 or later
 wiking	but for some reason that if branch keeps being true
 blackburn	he seems to be a hardcore guy
 blackburn	using RHEL
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you graduate from kindness school? :)
 n4nd0	blackburn: haha why so?
 wiking	doh
 n4nd0	it is free to be kind, not expensive :D
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	if i set _swig_version by hand the configure script fails
 wiking	aaah
 wiking	i think he is using a rather old shogun version
 wiking	where this check is not yet present in ./configure script
 wiking	as Result is: gcc 4.1.2, ok
 wiking	and afaik that should fail as well with < 4.3
 wiking	i wonder why they want to use shogun @ ernst & young ;P
 blackburn	hey really
 blackburn	what the heck
 wiking	maybe for tax auditing :DDD
 blackburn	why anybody in ernst & young would need shogun
 wiking	i guess some classification stuff on tax auditing data ;P
 blackburn	lol
 wiking	would be great to hear more what's his idea for application
 blackburn	hey we must get more E&Y users
 blackburn	I bet they have money
 blackburn	I don't mind to become rich :D
 wiking	hahahahahha
 wiking	yeah you should do a shogun spin-off ;P
 wiking	and make money of shogun support :)))))
 blackburn	n4nd0: did you notice
 wiking	i mean this guy should just fucking update his linux distrib
 blackburn	his name is sean
 blackburn	but email is arthur edge
 wiking	ah lol
 wiking	wtf?
 wiking	maybe he is disguising himself ;P
 n4nd0	haha yeah I noticed
 wiking	how old is RHEL 5.8 actually?
 blackburn	I like footer part
 n4nd0	I surprised myself when I thought, I am going to change the signature just in case it is not the same as the mail
 blackburn	wiking: 2010 probably
 n4nd0	to check* not to change
 wiking	duuude

 wiking	blackburn: http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Red-Hat-Enterprise-Linux-5-8-1439890.html
 wiking	and it's a 2012 february news
 wiking	wtf
 wiking	redhat ships with fucking gcc 4.1.x in 2012?
 blackburn	it is ENTERPRISE redhat
 blackburn	i.e.
 blackburn	slow
 blackburn	very slow
 blackburn	very very slow
 wiking	so it must be filled with acient stuff? :)
 blackburn	exactly
 blackburn	very very slow developing
 wiking	i guess they are following: 'the older the better'
 wiking	;)
 blackburn	they would use win95
 blackburn	if m$ did support it still
 wiking	ah lol
 wiking	there's gcc44 package
 wiking	so he should be ok
 blackburn	wiking: I know a company which forces my company to use ClearCase
 blackburn	heard about that?
 wiking	hahahah YES
 wiking	that's like fucking 2000
 blackburn	used?
 wiking	:D
 wiking	yes unfortunately
 blackburn	that's like
 blackburn	that's like nothing on the earth
 blackburn	it is pure love
 wiking	yeah it's a pure beauty
 wiking	:)))hahahhah
 blackburn	it is when you lose your mind of happiness
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	but serious, did they really think that dance is a good  way to develop
 blackburn	you have to create an integration stream to view sources
 wiking	hahahah
 wiking	NOOOOOO
 blackburn	then you add activity there you specify what do you want
 wiking	i dont want to hear about that shit!
 wiking	i had physical pain
 blackburn	and then you need to create a development stream
 wiking	when i had to use it
 blackburn	and join project with it
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	then checkout or hijack the file where you want to remove 2 lines
 blackburn	commit (or how is it called out there)
 wiking	i mean seriously why would u not use git+github in 2012?
 blackburn	and write down 40 pages description of the commit
 blackburn	we are using svn
 wiking	blackburn: and i hope u use git-svn ;)
 blackburn	but one project uses clearcase still
 wiking	blackburn: just to make them cry :))))
 blackburn	that is restricted and I didn't say that but it is TELUS
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	wiking: you are the only one but me developer of shogun
 blackburn	who have a sexual contact with CC
 blackburn	had*
 blackburn	I have still though
 wiking	:DDD
 wiking	fucking clearcase
 wiking	i know a guy
 wiking	!!!
 wiking	he just had to start to use it
 wiking	:DDDD
 blackburn	in 2012
 wiking	yep yep
 blackburn	sounds like torquemada is back
 wiking	2 weeks ago or something
 blackburn	and he is full of will to punish somebody
 wiking	yep
 wiking	he seemed desparate on facebook
 wiking	:P
 blackburn	that's quite normal to get a depression after using CC for a while
 blackburn	I am pretty sure there was a case of commiting suicide after trying to get that thing to get your changes
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	i think a git-cc project would never be possible
 blackburn	I am not using git-svn btw
 wiking	LOOOOL
 wiking	i was proved WRONG
 wiking	*kabooom*
 wiking	https://github.com/charleso/git-cc
 wiking	:DDDD
 blackburn	I actually feel comfortable with svn as well
 wiking	"Warning
 wiking	=======
 wiking	I wrote this purely for fun and to see if I could stop use Clearcase at work
 wiking	once and for all."
 blackburn	for the thing we develop it is ok
 wiking	:DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
 wiking	blackburn: yeah i just don't like that u actually cannot commit a code in svn w/o having internet connection
 wiking	"Actually what I would love to see
 wiking	more is for Clearcase to die"
 blackburn	wiking: that is ok when you have pretty reliable internet connection at your job
 wiking	lol this guy did feel the pain
 blackburn	I share his pain
 blackburn	okay I am going to sleep now probably
 wiking	gnite
 blackburn	I am going to be at job 10 (11) o'clock :D
 blackburn	or sth like 10*

 blackburn1	CC looks like a space ship command panel
 wiking	:)))
 blackburn1	who knows may be one button could destroy the whole world
 wiking	yeah i think it opens a new dimension if u try it :)))
 blackburn1	one may end with nuclear war or some chemical disaster
 wiking	if saddam would have used gitcc
 n4nd0	haha you guys scare me sometimes :D
 wiking	maybe they would have found some weapons of mass destructions :D
 blackburn1	yeah CC with development stream
 blackburn1	with all files hijacked
 blackburn1	n4nd0: you should try CC
 blackburn1	to achieve zen
 blackburn1	in hofstadter book a theory that zen's stuff is just for destroy of all means

 blackburn1	CC is just the same, it destroys development as we know it
 n4nd0	cc is a version control system right?
 blackburn1	yes
 wiking	n4nd0: nonono
 wiking	blackburn1: dont confuse him
 blackburn1	spaceship missile control system
 n4nd0	I was confused at the beginning with the command cc
 blackburn1	with version control support
 wiking	n4nd0: it's like a nuclear reactor man
 n4nd0	hahaha
 blackburn1	have you seen star trek?
 n4nd0	no
 blackburn1	may be gayniggers from the outer space?
 blackburn1	they had planet destruction stuff
 blackburn1	it comes out of box with clear case
 n4nd0	I don't know what the heck are you talking about :)
 wiking	:D
 wiking	n4nd0: never ever touch clearcase man
 wiking	not even in your dreams
 n4nd0	all right, I promise you that :)
 n4nd0	I had heard about subversion and cvs but not about clearcase
 n4nd0	when was that used?
 blackburn1	n4nd0: in 1400-1450
 blackburn1	when the inquisition was like fashion
 wiking	hahahahha
 wiking	blackburn1: columbus tried to teach CC for the indians
 wiking	and they told him: i rather fucking die
 n4nd0	:DD
 wiking	ok i know i might be a bit offensive with this comment, wasn't inteded
 n4nd0	then it was probably invented by Spanish people
 blackburn1	n4nd0: it is not true jeanne d'arc was burnt
 n4nd0	Spain was quite an important country back then
 blackburn1	she had to commit to UNOPENABLE DEVELOPMENT STREAM
 n4nd0	is that like a code in that system?
 wiking	n4nd0: i think they thought that using CC would be the solution... that's why your ship sank against nelson admiral
 blackburn1	yeah, they just forgot to complete VOBs on integration views
 blackburn1	that usually leads to ship sink or sth like that
 blackburn1	chernobyl is the similar case
 wiking	:DDDD
 blackburn1	somebody joined wrong project
 n4nd0	haha
 wiking	blackburn1: i bet gorbachov thought that using CC would be the solution as well
 n4nd0	I think we should move shogun to CC
 blackburn1	haha lol
 n4nd0	fuck off with git
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	CC sounds exciting
 blackburn1	it is

 n4nd0	CC vs git
 blackburn1	have a nice night I will push you tomorrow to develop more code with clearcase
 blackburn1	oh
 blackburn1	lock before edit is a pros
 blackburn1	is in pros*
 blackburn1	that's really nice
 blackburn1	wiking: fits for your issue about breaking code :D
 n4nd0	First, I would answer that comparing git to UCM is unfair to ClearCase, and not only from the point of view of performance!
 blackburn1	nobody would break your code because you can LOCK IT
 blackburn1	:D ohmfg
 wiking	:DDD
 blackburn1	n4nd0: they all sound like dinosaurs
 blackburn1	I've seen one BIG COMPANY WITH MANAGERS claimed that open source solutions sucks
 blackburn1	recently
 blackburn1	in 2012
 wiking	blackburn1: yes
 blackburn1	gosh
 wiking	blackburn1: that's pretty much normal :D
 n4nd0	haha
 blackburn1	okay okay
 n4nd0	I found an answer you would like more in another forum
 blackburn1	see you tomorrow
 blackburn1	:)
 n4nd0	Now, there is some potential in ClearCase that might make it compare favourably to Git.
 wiking	duuuude
 wiking	" If not, I'll probably need to have some internal discussion before proceeding.
 n4nd0	But it is not commonly known or used, and would require some support at last from IBM.
 wiking	these guys are trying to use
 n4nd0	I love the last part

 wiking	let's support EY to use shoung
 wiking	:D
 wiking	erm shogun ;P
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	wiking: do you know it gcc 4.1 will go well with shogun v.1.1.0?
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i'm just checking
 wiking	that why actually we had that bug
 wiking	i must dig out the stupid commit log
 wiking	ok yeah htis one
 wiking	mmmm http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23287
 wiking	n4nd0: can u open this one?
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	it took a bit long though
 wiking	yeah here too
 wiking	mmm what was the code that actually caused this one
 wiking	ah git grep will tell me
 n4nd0	oh didn't know there is a grep in git
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	it's fucking great
 wiking	;)
 n4nd0	sound really useful yes
 n4nd0	thank you!
 wiking	awesomefast
 wiking	mmm do we have tags?
 wiking	ah yeah cool we do
 n4nd0	what are you executing exactly?
 wiking	trying to find out
 wiking	whether that bug actually present in 1.1.0 version
 n4nd0	what command are you using? just to learn more about it
 wiking	well now i've done this
 wiking	git grep "\.~"
 wiking	that'll give me back where the destructor was called explicitly in the code
 wiking	and now i wanna do the same
 wiking	on the 1.1.0 tag
 wiking	but i cannot find tag for that
 n4nd0	aham I see
 wiking	git tag
 n4nd0	did you go back to that commit?
 wiking	n4nd0: yeah tag is for that
 n4nd0	what was the gcc bug exactly?
 wiking	n4nd0: that you cannot call explicitly a destructor
 wiking	on a templated class
 n4nd0	all right
 wiking	i.e. something.~SGVector<float64_t>()
 wiking	will not compile
 n4nd0	ok
 wiking	the problem is that there's no tag for 1.1.0 release
 n4nd0	too bad
 wiking	i'll check 1.0.0
 n4nd0	maybe with the release date we can guess the last commit done by that time?
 wiking	ok in 1.0.0 there was no such thing
 wiking	mmm i cannot see it from the git log
 wiking	which one supposed to be the 1.1.0 release
 wiking	ok
 wiking	how the fuck he downloaded 1.1.0 ?
 wiking	ah ok
 wiking	i was checking the wrong thingy
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	i really dont feel for downloading the tar.gz and do a grep -r on it
 wiking	;)
 wiking	i'll just tell him to try to compile it with 4.1
 wiking	and it might fail
 wiking	if it does
 wiking	then it's because we execute that bug :D
 n4nd0	but
 n4nd0	wasn't the bug fixed in gcc 4?
 wiking	n4nd0: after 4.3
 n4nd0	ahh al right
 n4nd0	I thought it was after 3.x
 wiking	noup
 wiking	4.3 and later
 wiking	n4nd0: check the comments on the bug page
 wiking	ok this guy might be lucky
 wiking	i've just checked it :D
 n4nd0	let's see
 wiking	ok
 wiking	support email sent
 n4nd0	good job, nice mail!
 wiking	hahah another one
 wiking	osx
 wiking	it should fucking work
 wiking	ok shit i forgot to cc the mailinglist
 wiking	;(
 wiking	wonder what acient osx is he using
 n4nd0	time to sleep for me
