@wiking	HeikoS: yo
@HeikoS	wiking: yo!
@wiking	sup man ? busy busy with the uni?
@HeikoS	yeah as usual ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: aistats deadline
@HeikoS	working on article
@HeikoS	wiking: and you?
@HeikoS	will get back to shogun after that one since experiments will be based on shogun and lambday 's work
@wiking	hehe articles
@wiking	haven't touched an article for about 9 months now :)
@HeikoS	wiking: well
@wiking	yeah i'm just doing the usual
@HeikoS	wiking: you know how this goes ;)
@wiking	getting shogun in shape
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome!
@wiking	lot of lot of problemes here and there
@HeikoS	wiking: whats missing for the release?
@wiking	like the whole viennacl backend is totally broken on osx
@HeikoS	wiking: oh btw good news
@wiking	:)
@wiking	and in the meanwhile i've foudn this tool
@HeikoS	wiking: I supervise an undergraduate student now, doing this meta language project
@HeikoS	wiking: and another guy at the institute told me  he wants to get involved
@wiking	ah cool
@wiking	get them on irc
@HeikoS	wiking: which tool?
@HeikoS	glongo: I think thats you right?
@wiking	btw what happened with centurylink? :DD
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah, annoying
@HeikoS	wiking: nothing happened
@wiking	HeikoS: just trying to figure out where i've stored the link
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i know thenm... i told ya. they are the same when it's about $
@HeikoS	wiking: well just keep on trying
@HeikoS	wiking: currently also talking to another startup that uses SHogun
@HeikoS	helping them etc
 glongo	HeikoS: yes
@HeikoS	so lets see
@wiking	this tool
@wiking	https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
@wiking	HeikoS: do they really use it?!
@HeikoS	glongo: meet wiking, viktor, who is another core guy
@HeikoS	wiking: yes, for classifying things
@wiking	woah man
@HeikoS	wiking: gps and svms
@HeikoS	wiking: internally
@wiking	why don't they fire bugs
@wiking	:)))
@HeikoS	wiking: I told them
@HeikoS	wiking: lets see
@wiking	if they find anything broken
@HeikoS	wiking: ah cool tool!
 glongo	hi :)
@wiking	please submit
@wiking	we dont need $ per se
@HeikoS	wiking: did you try?
@HeikoS	wiking: I know,
@wiking	it's just to know what are the breaking shit in shogun
@HeikoS	wiking: mostly people using it
@wiking	(apart from not supporting bigger than 10 megs csvs :P)
@wiking	HeikoS: no i haven't tried it yet
@wiking	but that's tht thing i want to try no
@wiking	now
@wiking	if it's really as easy as they say
@wiking	we might have our candidate for package generation -> docker image generation
@wiking	-> cloud updated
@wiking	:P
@wiking	but let's see how it works out
@HeikoS	wiking: awesome!
@HeikoS	ubuntu package would also be amazing you know
@HeikoS	in particular before release
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	i know
@wiking	too much good to have
@wiking	too little time
-!- glongo [sid17594@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-wyvlqqjlecyzalri] has left #shogun []
@wiking	https://github.com/bernd/fpm-recipes/blob/master/elasticsearch/recipe.rb
@wiking	this like a rule file
@wiking	that basically can generate anything
-!- glongo [sid17594@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-wyvlqqjlecyzalri] has joined #shogun
@wiking	seems like piece of cake :P
@HeikoS	wiking: wow thats so cool
@HeikoS	wiking: did you try for shogun?
@wiking	yeah i'm just doing it as we talk
 glongo	HeikoS: can I get involved?
@HeikoS	wiking: I think thats super high priority, more than anything else
@wiking	yeah i know
@wiking	that's why i'm rolling it now
@HeikoS	wiking: sweet
@wiking	if that works out then we'll have
@HeikoS	glongo:  managed to install shogun so far?
@wiking	rpm+deb+osx
@HeikoS	glongo: the linear algebra interface would be cool
@wiking	out of box
@HeikoS	glongo:  like the KRR in terms of that would be nice
@HeikoS	wiking: do we already have linear solves or Cholesky in linalg?    lambday ?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn ^
@wiking	noup
@HeikoS	glongo: or unit test sfor KRR would also be good!
@HeikoS	glongo: as a first step to understand how things work
 glongo	nice
@HeikoS	glongo: step1: install step2: run example step3: run unit test step4: write unit test
 lambday	HeikoS: hey.. no we still don't have those
@wiking	HeikoS: matrix decompistion like ldl, qr is missing from linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: how much work is it to add? we have someone who would port an algorithm to using linalg
@HeikoS	lambday: read your suggestions btw
@HeikoS	lambday: proper software design, I like it a lot
 lambday	HeikoS: well I can add the basic stuff... but don't know viennacl much to add that particular backend
@HeikoS	lambday: what about eigen3 only for now
@HeikoS	lambday: we just need the interface
 lambday	HeikoS: okay... adding to my todo list
@HeikoS	lambday: for linear solve say, and maybe cholesky
@HeikoS	lambday: and triangular solve
@HeikoS	thats all for now
 lambday	HeikoS: alright..
 lambday	HeikoS: about the design.. yesterday I discussed some with lisitsyn ... so I'm gonna go ahead with this structure in hand and do similar thing to kernel manager.. once the whole piece is ready, I'll shogunize it
@HeikoS	lambday: yep sounds like a good plan
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe we can apply some ideas to the whole of shogun afterwards?
@HeikoS	lambday: since this is really modern design that we want to have everywhere
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe you can lead a modernisation of Shogun ;)
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that's something I wanted to discuss.. maybe in some formal meeting
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe after the paper is done, currently on pause which is a bit annoying, but we will get back to it soon
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, next stammtisch
 lambday	HeikoS: lol I'm barely the guy... but if you wiking and lisitsyn join me I think we can do better :)
@HeikoS	lambday: Ill send an email for this one
@HeikoS	lambday: agreed
@HeikoS	lambday: you know the problem as usual: time ;)
@HeikoS	lambday: I really want to get this hackathon thing, so Iwill focus on this next
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah that would be super cool... I am also damn excited about lisitsyn aer...
 lambday	HeikoS: wiking: could you please open a list of issues on github for the things we want to add to generic linalg?
@HeikoS	lambday: yes me too
@HeikoS	lambday: matrix factorisations and linear solves (+triangular) are the most important ones
 lambday	HeikoS: maybe khaled can arrange some time for the viennacl part
@HeikoS	lambday, wiking the viennacl is actually not that important, interface is more  for now
@HeikoS	lambday: we can just depend on eigen, but the point is to get the layer in
@HeikoS	lambday: to be ready for future extensions
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah.. agreed...
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: mr heiko!
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: heya! :)
@lisitsyn	how are you doing?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah very good
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: lots of things, lots of travelling
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how about yourself?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: pretty fine
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: finally work with ml :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: cool, what do you do?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: TBs of logs -> some ad targeting
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: nice
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what models?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: neural nets and linear yet
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sweet
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: self coded?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I want to push something advanced but don't know yet :D
@lisitsyn	we use vw but nets are self coded
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am now more sure we need fast 'apply' part of shogun
@wiking	lisitsyn: :DDD
@wiking	lisitsyn: dreamon :>
@wiking	but yeah
@wiking	lets do it! :>
@wiking	chuchuuchuuuu release train
@wiking	:>
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: haha
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: good project
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: but for now: release! :)
