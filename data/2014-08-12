 a_student	hi there, I was wondering if anyone can help me with a multithreading issue in Shogun-3.2.0. My install went fine, and have no problem running classification problems on a single thread, but trying to increase the number of threads (via, say, mkl.parallel.set_num_threads(4)) does nothing - I continue using a single thread. Is there some cmake flag that enables multithreading? Thank you for your help.
