@iglesiasg	Hello nileshK, how are you doing?
 nileshK	Hi
 nileshK	I am good
@iglesiasg	Cool, good to hear
@iglesiasg	Let's try to get your issue sorted out. Did you get to a new point?
 nileshK	Yeah I have reached here
 nileshK	Havent done the fix yet.
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/20bI0Zyf
 nileshK	Also I tried moving it to the LPM.cpp
@iglesiasg	All right, let's try then if the last fix I told you fixes that
@iglesiasg	Moving CLMP::set_features to LPM.cpp and also including DotFeatures.h there
@iglesiasg	err, CLPM::set_features, sorry
 nileshK	Yeah. Let me do that. And I have a a bad internet connection
@iglesiasg	That's ok
@lisitsyn	hey
@iglesiasg	hello
@lisitsyn	how are you?
@iglesiasg	good good, and you?
@lisitsyn	a bit sick, Heiko sent me some viruses I guess
@lisitsyn	:D
 nileshK	Haha
@iglesiasg	haha
@lisitsyn	what's the LPM thing going on? are you working on something?
 nileshK	Fernando: It went through waiting for it to throw some error 7 % till now
 nileshK	We are actually trying to get Cplex parts of the code working. They havent been updated since long
@lisitsyn	ahh
@lisitsyn	drop them
 nileshK	So, LPBoost LPM this algorithms had stopped working
@lisitsyn	:D
 nileshK	Yeah. But as a fact this is one of the USP of Shogun
 nileshK	There are no other machine learning libraries that have LpBoost and LPM such algorithms in them
@iglesiasg	lol
 nileshK	Fernando : new error

@iglesiasg	that a user has to tell us we should not drop something because it is one of our unique features is definitely funny
@lisitsyn	are they of any use nowadays?
@lisitsyn	:D
@lisitsyn	everybody just puts a neural layer on top of neural layer nowadays
@iglesiasg	I guess the hype has a lot to do with the fact that we only hear about that
 nileshK	yeah.
@iglesiasg	nileshK: there is something weird there
@iglesiasg	nileshK: I find no call to get_transposed in that example
 nileshK	yeah I think I should do a make clean
 nileshK	and do a make again
@iglesiasg	nileshK: oh yeah, please do
@iglesiasg	nileshK: by the way
@iglesiasg	since you are compiling and recompiling quite often, ccache will probably be of lot of use
@iglesiasg	just do apt-get install ccache
@iglesiasg	and that's all you have to do
@iglesiasg	nothing else to take advantage of it whatsoever
 nileshK	Ok
 nileshK	It will take 2-3 mins to compile again
@iglesiasg	Perfect

 nileshK	Its taking longer. Will ping you as soon as it gets over
@iglesiasg	nileshK: Sure
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/LblCTO2K
 nileshK	Still have the same error iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	nileshK: what the heck
@iglesiasg	nileshK: please copy the example you have locally and let me see
@iglesiasg	nileshK: you can find it under <your_shogun_root_dir>/examples/undocumented/libshogun/balanced...
 nileshK	It too does not have any calls to the function get_transposed
 nileshK	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/S5Wx3Wqn
@iglesiasg	nileshK: all right, then, I think it should be that something that is being used from that example is calling get_transposed(int, int)
@iglesiasg	nileshK: let me find out
@iglesiasg	that method indeed exists in CSparseFeatures though...
 nileshK	HashedWDFeaturesTransposed
 nileshK	and LPBoost.cpp                init         49 sfeat= ((CSparseFeatures<float64_t>*)
 nileshK	                                             features)->get_transposed(num_sfeat,
 nileshK	                                             num_svec);
@iglesiasg	nileshK: I think you are building Shogun in Release mode, right?
 nileshK	are the only two library functions that call get_transposed
 nileshK	I am not sure.
 nileshK	I configured it using cmake ../
 nileshK	no other options
@iglesiasg	nileshK: hold on a second
@iglesiasg	nileshK: features/SparseFeatures.h:205:CSparseFeatures<ST>* get_transposed(); features/SparseFeatures.h:218:SGSparseVector<ST>* get_transposed(int32_t &num_feat, int32_t &num_vec); features/SparseFeatures.cpp:220:template<class ST> CSparseFeatures<ST>* CSparseFeatures<ST>::get_transposed() features/SparseFeatures.cpp:225:return new CSparseFeatures<ST>(sparse_feature_matrix.get_transposed());
@iglesiasg	ups, shitty copy paste
@iglesiasg	http://pastebin.com/VXNcTWuh
@iglesiasg	So, basically, the method is only in the header, not implemented...
 nileshK	oh. I see
@iglesiasg	and it is being used in classifier/LPBoost.cpp:49 and mathematics/Cplex.cpp:401
 nileshK	Yeah
@iglesiasg	I have to think how to fix this properly, give me some time
 nileshK	Ok
@iglesiasg	all right, we are somewhat good
@iglesiasg	I have found a commit with the implementation of the method
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/4e58cf6bec09eb12012f8f77ac6b76441ec8c734
@iglesiasg	line 413
@iglesiasg	let me see if I find the commit that removed it, there may be a good reason why that was done
@iglesiasg	so nileshK
@iglesiasg	I am sorry but I need to change plans
@iglesiasg	I am at job and I should focus on another thing that would be good to be ready before 3 hours
@iglesiasg	you can continue to investigate this issue a bit further and let me know if you find something out
@iglesiasg	I will be back to it later
 nileshK	Ok
 nileshK	Sure :)
 nileshK	Thanks
 nileshK	I will try to use the implemented method and see if that stuff compiles

 nileshK	iglesiasg: This was the last commit where the code for get_transposed existed a633ff6f4d9fd9a7672144bee73bc1c5e52938bb
 nileshK	And in the next commit it was removed by Soeren
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: parteeey! :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: havent seen you in ages man, how are things?
 nileshK	HeikoS: Need a small help
@HeikoS	nileshK: hi sure
@HeikoS	what is it?
 nileshK	Check this commit on a633ff6f4d9fd9a7672144bee73bc1c5e52938bb
 nileshK	It has a function called get_transposed(int& , int &)
 nileshK	in SparseFeatures.cpp file
 nileshK	But in the next commit the function was deleted
 nileshK	I am unable to understand the reason for the same
 nileshK	Because that function definition was needed for Cplex.cpp and LPBoost.cpp
 nileshK	HeikoS: I just checked the commits for src/shogun/features/SparseFeatures.cpp

@HeikoS	nileshK: It wasnt remove, just changed signature
@HeikoS	and since tests doesnt cover cplex, it slipped through
@HeikoS	you can easifly fix this, have a look at the get_transposed method in CSparseFeatures
@HeikoS	you can just adapt the call in LPBoost
@HeikoS	one line change
@HeikoS	let us know if you can get it to wokr
@HeikoS	and a unit test would also be appreciated
