 bumblebee	HeikoS: there?
 HeikoS	bumblebee: yes, hi
 bumblebee	Hey, i am not really familiar with IPython, any help, any link, I have a rough idea though
 bumblebee	btw, for #1982 "Process small datasets for recommendation systems", just wanted to know whethe i am on right track for processing and readind data
 bumblebee	using shogun i.e.
 HeikoS	bumblebee: you should ask google, ipython is very well documented in every sense
 bumblebee	ohk, sure!! will follow up
 HeikoS	bumblebee: which OS are you using?
 bumblebee	ubuntu
 HeikoS	bumblebee: on linux its just sudo pip install ipython
 bumblebee	yea, got that part, i did the install and all
 bumblebee	just not clear with how i will be using ML on top of a ipython notebook
 bumblebee	so is it that I will process and read data using python through a notebook, and then use ML algos using shogun
 bumblebee	cause it will be in C++, or i will be using python for that too
 bumblebee	?
 bumblebee	HeikoS: so it's basically use the sushi data in a ipython notebook for a given algo. in shogun
 HeikoS	bumblebee: nono, its all python interface to shogun
 HeikoS	bumblebee: so you use the same class to load the data than you did in your c++ code
 HeikoS	but from python
 HeikoS	and then you will call the GP algorithms in Shogun from python
 HeikoS	all from the notebook
 bumblebee	oh alright
 bumblebee	HeikoS: no theory,
 bumblebee	?
 bumblebee	HeikoS:Also shogun is written in C++, right? and it's interfacing is primaraily /always in python or is it that only for this example and matters as per users convinience?

@wiking	lambday: yoyoyoooo
@wiking	lambday: here?
 lambday	wiking: hey!
@wiking	lambday: oh great u r here
@wiking	so i'm almost done with the refactoring of eigen solver
@wiking	but i have a small problem now
@wiking	so currently in LanczosSolver
 lambday	wiking: oh great! what is it?
@wiking	you basically calculate the extremal eigen values
@wiking	while the new api currently doesn't support that
@wiking	i.e. we have like
@wiking	compute()
@wiking	that computes all of them
@wiking	and compute_few()
@wiking	where the few means an index intervall
@wiking	(just like lapack)
@wiking	if we use compute_few for calculating the extremals
@wiking	it's just as if we call compute
@wiking	i'm wondering if u have some api suggestions here? :)
@wiking	like changing compute_few() into
@wiking	where you can pass an SGVector<index_t> idx
@wiking	that identifies what eigenvalues u r interested in? :)
@wiking	or maybe have both... compute_few (lower index, upper index)
@wiking	compute_few(SGVector<index_t> idx)
 lambday	wiking: well, if indices are far apart then it makes sense to compute all instead...
 lambday	this will make a diference only when a range is provided
 lambday	right?
-!- kislay [~kislay@117.239.94.112] has joined #shogun
 lambday	I mean, passing individually indices is probably something we won't need.. rather just compute all would be the way to go
@wiking	lambday: that's a huge overhead
@wiking	i mean compared to what we do now
@wiking	right?
@wiking	currently with lanczos u calculate only 2 eigen values
 lambday	yeah
 lambday	2 calls
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	computing all
@wiking	will take much longer
 lambday	yeah true
@wiking	(of course it depends on the linear operator size)
-!- bumblebee [~quassel@202.78.172.162] has joined #shogun
@wiking	but if they are not dummy tests then i'd say it'll be a huge runtime difference
 lambday	wiking: so I was thinking compute_few should do something like this - it computes eigenvalue indices from 0 to k... and j to N
 lambday	N is #evs
 lambday	and k and j are to be passed as params
@wiking	ah ok
@wiking	so instead of like what lapack
@wiking	where you give the interval you want
@wiking	you give lower upper and higher lower boundaries
 lambday	wiking: I guess that would fit nicely into the existing implementation
@wiking	[0,k], [j,N]
 lambday	yo
@wiking	yeah we can change into that
@wiking	and then you know that in the SGVector<float64_t> the first k values are the for the lower interval and the remaining N-j values are fot the upper interval
 lambday	wiking: oh and one more thing - did you happen to check the CPU/GPU dot thread? using a LinearAlgebra wrapper for setting different backends for all dots, eigensolvers etc all at once?
 lambday	something like sg_linalg->set_backend()
 lambday	wiking: yeah!
@wiking	lambday: yeah i'm into that
@wiking	lambday: i mean you'll see my new commit
@wiking	that doesn't have this yet
@wiking	but i'll introduce later some sort of globally settable flag
@wiking	where u can switch backends
@wiking	(lapack, eigen etc.)
 lambday	wiking: absolutely - that would be great!
 lambday	wiking: and our linear algreba routines would rely on global functors or sort - so that one interface works for all backends
@wiking	well that's the plan
@wiking	but it'll be quite a pain
 lambday	massive pita
 lambday	wiking: plus heiko likes that vector-dot-operators should be brought under linear operator interface - that would involve lots of refactoring
 lambday	templating a lot of things
 lambday	I hope its worth it
 lambday	:)
@wiking	well yeah that'll need a new feature branch i reckon
 lambday	wiking: by the way I am not sure about this [0,k], [j,N] thing - I mean, what if someone is only interested in N/2-th ev?
 lambday	:-/
@wiking	he is fucked :)
 lambday	wiking: lol so we gotta take care that he's not :D
 lambday	umm...
@wiking	btw somebody fucked up src/shogun/mathematics/linalg/ratapprox/logdet/LogDetEstimator.cpp
@wiking	this should not be present
@wiking	CLogDetEstimator::CLogDetEstimator(SGSparseMatrix<float64_t> sparse_mat)
@wiking	unless one has both EIGEN3 and LAPACK
 lambday	wiking: oh shit!
@wiking	as currently LanczosSolver depends on both
 lambday	yeah!
 lambday	wiking: let's ask sunil (who changed this) to fix this
 lambday	wiking: should I open an issue or just fix it?
@wiking	lambday: as u wish
 lambday	wiking: I guess we should provide different interfaces for compute_few... I was just working on a problem that requires to compute last k eigenvalues...
@wiking	hehe yeah
@wiking	there's unforetunetely no one for all api for this problem
 lambday	wiking: it can be set using j, k and a boolean flag I guess... when the flag is set, we compute [j, k]... if unset, we compute [0,j],[k,N]
@wiking	hahah
 lambday	:D
@wiking	that's a really aweful design
 lambday	crazy - works though! :D
@wiking	we can have several compute_few functions
@wiking	and then one calls the right one
@wiking	and that's all
@wiking	lambday: no it's not crazy it really bad design
@wiking	a flag for doing things
@wiking	it's like 1970s
@wiking	that's like exactly how lapack is working
@wiking	V if you want the eigenvalues as well
@wiking	U if not
 lambday	:D
@wiking	or some shit like that... please it's 2014 now
@wiking	let's be a bit more sophisticated
@wiking	if possible

 lambday	HeikoS1: hi!
 lambday	wiking: the cg iterations is common for all compute methods.. so I think that can be pushed under a private method - say, compute_Lanczos_T_matrix().. all compute methods will require that

 DarkRoom	lisitsyn: Hi!
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: hey
 DarkRoom	I've applied to GSoC, the deep learning project.
 DarkRoom	I was looking at the convolution task mentioned by you.
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: sure
 DarkRoom	so I planned on using OpenMP to parallize the code (to be run on the CPU)
 lisitsyn	hmm yeah why not
 lisitsyn	it makes sense
 DarkRoom	I got a runtime of 3.4 seconds for a 2000 x 2000 matrix and a 50 x 50 kernel.
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: cool
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: actually it is worth to post it to the issue
 DarkRoom	Sure.
 HeikoS1	lambday: hi
 DarkRoom	I think I might be able to do better, though.
 lambday	HeikoS1: hey... me and wiking were just discussing about the interface for compute_few() in eigensolvers
 HeikoS1	lambday: I see, and?
 HeikoS1	what about having a get_eigenvectors method which returns a matrix
 lambday	HeikoS1: so, many cases we need to compute [0,j].. [k,N]... and [j,k] evs
 HeikoS1	yeah
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah that should also be there!
 HeikoS1	lambday: ok tell me what you wanna do
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: it would be better to submit some code than reach some performance
 lambday	HeikoS1: having separate interfaces for compute_few for these different cases is the solution I guess.. otherwise one interface would require flags and all.. makes it ugly
 HeikoS1	lambday: ok, mmmmh
 HeikoS1	why cant we just tell the thing in the beginning how many eigenvectors to compute
 HeikoS1	and then compute does it
 DarkRoom	lisitsyn: Sure. Will do. But is it okay if I submit a standalone version (not integrated with the toolbox) for now, as I would like to first get better performances.
 lambday	HeikoS1: how many is fine.. but which ones...
 HeikoS1	and then there are methods to get all computed eigenvectors (a matrix) and eigenvectors with a certain index
 HeikoS1	all computed eigenvectors are either a square matrix (all) or a matrix containing say only 3.
 HeikoS1	or one can do get_eigenvector which returns a vector
 HeikoS1	get_eigenvectors(idx)
 HeikoS1	and then we can also have the get_largest and get_smallest, that is just wrapper stuff
 HeikoS1	so everythign is handled in the constructor
 HeikoS1	lambday: but I dont insist on that, if you want to have a seperate class for few eigenvectors and all eigenvectors its fine
 HeikoS1	lambday: after all, few eigenvectors will only be nececssary for large sparse matrices
 lambday	HeikoS1: no no.. not separate class.. a separate overloaded method
 HeikoS1	lambday: so the backends *will* definitely differ
 HeikoS1	lambday: ah yeah, please go ahead
 lisitsyn	DarkRoom: having it integrated would be important too
 DarkRoom	lisitsyn: Yes, I'll do that too.
 lambday	HeikoS1: I added unit-tests for different number of samples and verified against this implementation - https://github.com/lambday/shogun-hypothesis-testing/blob/master/mmd.py
 lambday	HeikoS1: sending a PR :)
 HeikoS1	lambday: nice :) Put the link also in the PR pls
 lambday	HeikoS1: yeah - put that in comment as well :)
 HeikoS1	lambday: I will re-check this with dino today but I think it was already fine
 lambday	HeikoS1: okay :)
 lambday	HeikoS1: oh and should I again make a quick B-test implementation in python as well? then we can check if its fine and later use that for unit-tests
 HeikoS1	lambday: totally! this is always usefu.l
 lambday	HeikoS1: alright :)

 kislay	HeikoS1, I have sent a PR regarding #2064
 kislay	HeikoS1, tried to keep their structure similar.
 HeikoS1	kislay: nice, thanks!
 HeikoS1	kislay: I will have a look later today
 kislay	HeikoS1, sure.
 kislay	HeikoS1, I have worked a lot of with these issues but I am kinda unable to start with the core shogun code. Any Issue you can tell where I can commit myself for now.
 kislay	HeikoS1, It will be really helpful.
 HeikoS1	kislay: what do you  mean exactly?
 HeikoS1	kislay: maybe write a unit test for some existing methods,
 HeikoS1	kislay: or wh ynot extend a web-demo with model-selection for GPs
 HeikoS1	add a button ("learn parameters with ML2")
 kislay	HeikoS1, yup. thats what I was asking about :D
 HeikoS1	for that you need some internals of the GP framework, see my notebook and other examples
 kislay	HeikoS1, Okay. Now I have a target. Thanks :)
 HeikoS1	kislay: you are welcome, let me know if you have any quetsion :)
 HeikoS1	questions
 kislay	HeikoS1, I will work on adding a button thing for now. Then Unit tests for later.
 HeikoS1	kislay: yeah, for unit tests have a look into some issues
 HeikoS1	kislay: in general, look at the issue and just pick something
 HeikoS1	kislay: but in fact, all your notebook updates are appreciated even more :)
 HeikoS1	kislay: but demo stuff would be cool, you might find bugs, so that will get you involved into Shoguns internals
 kislay	HeikoS1, oh! never knew this :D

 sonne|work	nikolis: did you set the PYTHONPATH to the correct dir? did you use the same python version like you used for compiling, did you run ldconfig?
 sonne|work	...
 nikolis	i ges i did not set the python path because i figured out that if I run python from within the directory modshogun.py exist the imports run smoothly
 nikolis	the directory that contains * modshogun.py
 sonne|work	well then it would work when you install it someplace too
 nikolis	I am not sure if i get your last point
 nikolis	I mean i have already installed it
 sonne|work	where to?
 nikolis	shogun-install directory in my home folder
 sonne|work	and what did you set PYTHONPATH too?
 sonne|work	and LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
 nikolis	no i just set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 nikolis	I followed the instraction from quick start  file
 sonne|work	well that is for C/C++ stuff only you also need to set PYTHONPATH
 sonne|work	to the directory where modshogun.py is in (in you shogun-install dir)
 sonne|work	export PYTHONPATH=/some/path/to/some/dir/where/modshogun/is/in

 kislay	pickle27, Hi Kevin :)
 pickle27	hey
 kislay	pickle27, Any head start over the integration issue. I looked over the cmake file though.
 kislay	pickle27, what should be my plan of action for now?

 pickle27	kislay: sorry whats your github handle
 kislay	pickle27,  my user name is kislayabhi
@sonney2k	HeikoS1, pickle27 !
@sonney2k	hey pickle27!
 pickle27	okay cool
 pickle27	kislay: for now I would just keep working on entrance tasks and more ipython-notebooks!
 kislay	pickle27, yeah. I would love too :D
@sonney2k	wiking, https://hubic.com/en/
@sonney2k	wiking, ^ sounds like a nice way for backups
@sonney2k	pickle27, do you have any idea how we could use the the *.md files on the website to replace the docu?
@wiking	sonney2k: lol
@sonney2k	wiking, ?
 pickle27	sorry what exactly do you want the md files from where and to replace what
@wiking	sonney2k: very nice
@sonney2k	pickle27, we have all this documentation sometimes as doxygen and sometimes on the website and sometimes as .md files in shogun's src
@sonney2k	pickle27, IMHO we should just write the .md files in the src
@sonney2k	and update these to have them on the website where needed
 pickle27	yeah it should be easy enough to pull md from github for the site
@wiking	sonney2k: how much is google's space?
@sonney2k	pickle27, I mean we have that somehow
@sonney2k	pickle27, http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/md/README
@sonney2k	wiking, $99 for 10TB/ month
 pickle27	yeah I know we have that
@wiking	sonney2k: ok so this is insanely cheap
@sonney2k	pickle27, problem is to come up with some concept where this stuff is located
 pickle27	oh you want to replace the rest of the docs content so all we have is md on github and docygen
@sonney2k	pickle27, and then start replacing things like FAQ
@wiking	sonney2k: do they use some standard api to do it... or one has to use their own application...?
 pickle27	oh like the whole site even
@sonney2k	and a number of rapidly changing pages on the website with the .md files
@sonney2k	pickle27, maybe not whole
@sonney2k	but stuff like install/faq/readme/licence/authors or so
 pickle27	okay I know roughly how that was done, in the next bit I will add to the readme how to make a page load from github
@sonney2k	wiking, no idea - just saw that offer - it is from the ovh people (where shogun-toolbox.org is hosted and fatbot)
@wiking	sonney2k: yeah i know... https://api.hubic.com/
@wiking	shame is that they are not a real cdn ;)
* sonney2k smells abuses ;)
@sonney2k	pickle27, if you go to http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/md/README you will see that the links are b0rken - e.g. shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/md/doc/md/QUICKSTART.md
 pickle27	kk
@sonney2k	pickle27, so one thing to fix is links...
@sonney2k	I guess the logic here is follow what we have in shogun's src
@sonney2k	where we have doc/md
@sonney2k	so doc/md/QUICKSTART.md
@sonney2k	etc
