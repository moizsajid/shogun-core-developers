 cheng	Hi all, I spent some time mucking around trying to compile shogun on OSX, and was just wondering whether the problems I'm having are unique to my box.
 cheng	Basically, I have blas/lapack issues.
 cheng	OSX has plenty of different options, and in the end, I had to add --libs=/usr/lib to the configure to make it detect OSX veclib.
 cheng	Lots of other options had crazy errors due to gfortran versions, etc
 cheng	Just thought I'd share here to see whether anyone has any experience with this. It seems that /usr/lib should be obvious to add to the default configure.
 cheng	One more question: how do I get the SVM outputs for binary classification?
 cheng	get_labels returns -1,+1, and I'm not sure how get_confidence works.

 blackburn	n4nd0: congrats :D
 n4nd0	blackburn: thank you :)
 n4nd0	kind of unbelievable, 4-0!
 blackburn	well they became pretty upset after 2-0
 n4nd0	Italy?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yeah congrats from my side too. the only game where spain played nicely
@sonney2k	though
@sonney2k	well deserved, very nice goals
 n4nd0	sonney2k: c'mon ... against Ireland it was good too, similar to yesterday's one to tell the truth
 n4nd0	the extra time against Portugal was good as well
@sonney2k	true I forgot about that one
@sonney2k	no portugal did actually deserve to win
@sonney2k	but I really expected just a 1:0 from spain
 n4nd0	:O I don't agree with you there, sorry
@sonney2k	and then some spanish wall
 n4nd0	yeah, they actually played, that was nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: seen cheng /usr/lib issue?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I have no clue what goes wrong with R on the buildbot
@sonney2k	I mean it obviously installs ?!
 blackburn	just like I have no clue what goes wrong with octave modular :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need some mac system as buildbot...
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean with sparse typemaps?
 blackburn	yeah it reproduces only w/o valgrind/gdb
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	it reproduces with gdb
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I can no longer visit github.com since the lates chrome upgrade
@sonney2k	always hangs
 blackburn	when was it?
@sonney2k	the 20.x upgrade
@sonney2k	I have no idea what goes wrong
 blackburn	20.0 here
 blackburn	works smoothly
@sonney2k	great
@sonney2k	not here
@sonney2k	blackburn, nvidia inside?
 blackburn	no, some intel
 blackburn	not discrete
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: zxtx
-!- Netsplit over, joins: zxtx
@sonney2k	no idea - can only tell it sucks :/
 blackburn	sonney2k: linux world :D
@sonney2k	all other browsers work of course
 blackburn	just some hardware issue linux is full of
@sonney2k	windoze too but please buy dedicated w* hardware so things are well tested.
@sonney2k	n4nd0, btw do things go well now?
 blackburn	win is pretty nice with hardware because of $
@sonney2k	did you have a session with uricamic?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, I am working on the hm-svm
 n4nd0	I have been discussing with him but nothing special
 n4nd0	vojtech said he would send me a document with the unconstrained formulation of my problem so I could compare the results of my method
@sonney2k	k
 n4nd0	but I guess he has not managed to find time yet
 n4nd0	I should talk to Nico soon
 n4nd0	I hope he has some time today
@sonney2k	uricamic, could you please ping vojta about this issue?
 n4nd0	sonney2k: btw, Nico told me that I'd be able to ask Georg Zeller while he's on holidays, do you know if he's normally available?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, just email him
@sonney2k	the sooner the better though
@sonney2k	I would even do it this week just to get him to know
@sonney2k	I know him personally
@sonney2k	he is the other of the matlab hm svm toolbox
@sonney2k	and knows all the algorithmics but not so much about shogun
 n4nd0	ok

 n4nd0	hahaha
 blackburn	you are not!
 blackburn	:(
 blackburn	you are the dark lord and depression comes around you

 CIA-18	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r8fb2bb1 / src/configure : fix typo in configure HAVE_ARPACK -> HAVE_EIGEN3 - http://git.io/aI9Waw
@sonney2k	cheng, we really have problems getting access to some mac hardware
@sonney2k	cheng, more permanently that is
@sonney2k	we simply need one to have a buildbot reliably testing that arch
 cheng	sonney2k: I agree.
 cheng	The general problem with OSX is that one usually has about 4 versions of BLAS/LAPACK.
 cheng	So a buildbot doesn't really solve that problem.
@sonney2k	well at least we could detect the correct one by default and make sure it stays that way
 cheng	For example, I have the Xcode version, the enthought python version, the macports version and one more version which I cannot quite figure out why it is there, perhaps gfortran install?
 shogun-buildbot	build #21 of deb1 - libshogun started, including [8fb2bb18892999a00adbd5fafd61da52f075eb0c]
 cheng	At least on my mac, veclib was detected by adding --libs=/usr/lib
 shogun-buildbot	build #21 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/21

@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, that was fast
 cheng	sonney2k: how do I get svm scores from BinaryLabels?
@sonney2k	cheng, jsut get the confidences
@sonney2k	these are the original outputs of the SVM
 cheng	blackburn: To answer your question via email, adding --libs=/usr/lib makes configure detect veclib correctly and compiles happily.
 cheng	sonney2k: BinaryLabels.get_labels() gives +1, -1.
@sonney2k	cheng, get_confidences()
 shogun-buildbot	build #29 of deb2 - static_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/29  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 shogun-buildbot	build #28 of deb3 - modular_interfaces started, including [8fb2bb18892999a00adbd5fafd61da52f075eb0c]
* sonney2k *argh*
 cheng	sonney2k: BinaryLabels.get_confidences seems to want an int_32 as an argument.
@sonney2k	my backup machine died
@sonney2k	damn thunderstorms
 blackburn	cheng: I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, isn't it get_confidences?
 blackburn	sonney2k: get_confidences should have no parameter at all
 blackburn	sonney2k: or what do you ask?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes exactly
@sonney2k	cheng, don't mix it up with get_confidence(int)
@sonney2k	get_confidences() !
 blackburn	whoops I copypasted ARPACK badly
 blackburn	thanks for fixing
@sonney2k	blackburn, heiko did you get an email from the buildbot
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	(just now that is!)
 cheng	blackburn, sonney2k: thanks! Misread the s
 blackburn	let me check
 cheng	blackburn: I just tested it. It works.
@sonney2k	blackburn, so?
@sonney2k	should be your lisit* gmail address
@sonney2k	gtg... nap time is over
 blackburn	sonney2k: syn
 cheng	sonney2k: later.
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes I got it
 blackburn	new folder at gmail heh
 cheng	blackburn: while I was mucking around with lapack linking, I noted that the GP code need lapack somewhere, but somehow tries to compile it without lapack anyway.
 blackburn	oh ok I'll let puffin know about it
 cheng	I can try to reproduce that if it helps. Not sure how much it is an OSX think.
 cheng	OSX thing.
 blackburn	ah nevermind it is just a #ifdef
 blackburn	cheng: ah I recall I have jmlr paper :D do you think it makes sense to try again after all that time passed? I've never managed to improve before but could start a little later
 cheng	blackburn: please resubmit soon. :-)
 blackburn	how soon?
 blackburn	cheng: you know I wanted to change some code stuff and it would take some time
 blackburn	anyway I feel pretty unoptimistic about that :D probably will end up with arxiv
 cheng	Of course, the sooner the better, but take your time to do a good job.
 cheng	Why unoptimistic?
 cheng	pessimistic?
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	well it looks for me just like some crap - I see no valuable part here
 cheng	I see. Well, if it takes longer, the only danger is that you will get new reviewers, who may ask for more stuff.
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	then I will try to add more algos here and provide interface
 cheng	If I remember correctly, the problem was separating from shogun, and not how many algos you have.
 blackburn	sure
 blackburn	but I personally think it lacks some useful algos
 blackburn	t-SNE in particular, sammon mapping may be
 cheng	Your choice, I am just the messenger between reviewers and authors. :-)
 blackburn	thank you

 n4nd0	hey nicococo
 nicococo	hola n4nd0.. how are you
 nicococo	?
 n4nd0	I am good, what about you?
 nicococo	well, alright, i think you have 4:0 reasons to feel better than me :)
 n4nd0	haha :D yeah I think so
 n4nd0	it was a good day yesterday definetely
 nicococo	i can imagine..
 nicococo	okay, whats going on with the hmsvm?
 nicococo	(sorry, don't have that much time :( )
 n4nd0	no problem, I will try to be brief
 n4nd0	I implemented the joint feature computation
 n4nd0	and know I am planning how to do the argmax
 n4nd0	I have almost all the pieces clear for it ... almost :)
 nicococo	fine
 n4nd0	ok, so what about these vectors p and q?
 n4nd0	do they need to be estimated using training data?
 n4nd0	or are they defined in init_opt method
 n4nd0	?
 nicococo	usually no. in our implementation definitely not.
 n4nd0	no to which question :P?
 nicococo	aehm.. they don't belong to the optimization problem of the sosvm, hence they are not defined in the init_op method
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	2nd question
 nicococo	are you confused by the p and q.. or is it clear?
 n4nd0	I don't know how to get them
 nicococo	pre-defined
 nicococo	think of this: you now in which state you start and in which state you end
 n4nd0	why?
 nicococo	and if you don't now.. then add 2 artificial states just for the start and end of each sequence
 n4nd0	aham
 nicococo	it has some advantages. and p is mandatory since there is no p(q_1|q_0) defined
 nicococo	did you read the document?
 n4nd0	when you say add 2 artificial states
 n4nd0	do you mean to add two elements to the label sequence
 n4nd0	but for example, if we have a two-state model
 nicococo	that would be one possibility
 n4nd0	these artificial states would be either -1 or 1
 n4nd0	or another new state like 0 or so?
 nicococo	if you have a 2-state model you need two additional states (liek 3 and 4)
 n4nd0	ok
 nicococo	but for now, p and q are just needed in the viterbi
 n4nd0	yes
 n4nd0	does that make a difference?
 nicococo	difference to what?
 n4nd0	hehe like if to say that they are just needed in the Viterbi makes something different
 n4nd0	ok, forget about it :)
 nicococo	:)
 n4nd0	I think I am not very sure how to handle them, but I can think about it more
 nicococo	i would suggest to think about it less :)
 n4nd0	haha ok
 nicococo	if you look at the definition of the transition matrix
 n4nd0	yes
 nicococo	you have a transition from states y_i-1 to y_i right?
 n4nd0	yes
 nicococo	when you start at the first position of the sequence (i=1) then you have a transition from y_0 to y_1 .. but there is no y_0 hence you need a transition solely depending on the y_1
 nicococo	...and thats p
 n4nd0	ok, that's all right
 n4nd0	it's like the pi vector using the conventional notation for hmm I thinks
 n4nd0	think*
 nicococo	yes, indeed
 n4nd0	but in our framework
 nicococo	did you read the FAQ?
 n4nd0	yeah :)
 nicococo	is it alright or something missing/unclear?
 n4nd0	in our framework, where should we define p and q? in the HMMSVMModel?
 n4nd0	I think that it makes sense there
 nicococo	i agree
 n4nd0	yeah, I have a question about the FAQ too
 n4nd0	it is about the third question
 nicococo	okay
 n4nd0	so when I said in the question
 n4nd0	"Then, the
 n4nd0	first observation sequence, x0 , is never taken into account
 n4nd0	"
 n4nd0	that is wrong
 n4nd0	isn't it?
 nicococo	since we start with i=1 there is no x_0
 nicococo	the sequences always go from i=1 ... T
 n4nd0	I said, note that I am talking about 0-index ;)
 n4nd0	so it's like the sequences go from i=0 ... T-1
 n4nd0	but I think I got the point anyway
 n4nd0	I have to take into account all the features of x
 nicococo	aeh. oaky.. sure you can convert them
 n4nd0	you know ... C people are crazy and start counting the things at zero ... don't blame me :)
 nicococo	it's okay. i think i can handle that :)
 n4nd0	I think that the rest is ok
 nicococo	very good!
 n4nd0	I am going to do my best to have the Viterbi ready by tomorrow
 nicococo	so, please try everything out such that if anything is unclear we can talk about it as soon as
 nicococo	possible
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	I can mail you once I have pushed the Viterbi part
 nicococo	that would be nice.
 n4nd0	and if you can take a look to the HM-SVM Model it would be great
 nicococo	okay, i can do that. do you think we should talk tomorrow again?
 n4nd0	maybe we can plan it by mail better?
 n4nd0	depending on how my progress goes and if I get lot of doubts and stuff
 nicococo	alright. so, if question, hints, or whatever please mail me and we can add everything to the document
 n4nd0	cool
 n4nd0	ok, thank you very much then!
 n4nd0	good luck with your work ;)
 nicococo	so, very good work, thank you for that.. and see you soon
 nicococo	thanks :)

 puffin444	Hey heiko
 heiko1	hey puffin444
 puffin444	what do you think about the model selection checksum?
 heiko1	I actually just started reading
 heiko1	Ill get back to you when I understoof it :)
 puffin444	ok
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	sonney2k: hey there
 heiko1	puffin444 this get_char_description
 heiko1	what do you need it for? the hashing?
 puffin444	Yes. I use it to make a char array that the MD5 function can hash. Do you think its too complicated?
 heiko1	it looks a bit strange, why all these type distinctions and redundant code?
 puffin444	I store the value of the parameter in the description; the value may need more space depending on the type.
 heiko1	oh btw there is a method to get the size of a TParameter's primitive type
 puffin444	That would help alot.
 heiko1	its a bit hidden: have a look at TSGDataType in DataType.h
 heiko1	every TParameter instance has a TSGDataType
 heiko1	and this you can ask these things
 heiko1	but I still dont really get these loops
 puffin444	Yes that would simplify things.
 heiko1	big_name contains a char description of the data of the parameter?
 puffin444	big_name contains a description of the name and values of the parameter as well as all of its children.
 puffin444	The char description is recursively built. In order to store a value, I cast it as an unsigned char and store it that way. That is what the loops are for.
 heiko1	where children are respect to what?
 puffin444	Children that are SGObjects might have modelselection parameters themselves. I make sure that they are part of the description.
 heiko1	ok, i see ...
 heiko1	continuing reading ....
 heiko1	why only model-selection parameters?
 heiko1	because you only want to know when these changed, right?
 puffin444	Yes. I suppose I could check all parameters with m_parameters, yes?
 heiko1	but are other parameters not als important?
 heiko1	for what do you need that hashing?
 heiko1	for model-selection?
 heiko1	or for just knowing when to recompute stuff?
 puffin444	Knowing when to recompute stuff. sonney2k suggested it so I tried it out.
 heiko1	ok, yeah I mean its a nice idea
 heiko1	but I would include all parameters
 puffin444	will do.
 heiko1	since these might change during training or whatsoever
 heiko1	still this description code is strange ;)
 puffin444	Yes I did fear it was a little over-complicated.
 heiko1	I will go thorugh it a bit more and see if its possible to simplify
 puffin444	I also don't know if it's really appropriate for the parameter itself to include SGObject children in its description, but I don't think this checksum would be useful if I didn't look at all of parameters.
 heiko1	no youre right, a parameter has changed if the sub-parameter has changed
 heiko1	imagine a svm with a kernel with width
 heiko1	when the width has changed, the kernel has changed and an evtl kernel matrix in svm has to be recomputed
 heiko1	puffin444 I think this has to be done differently, see comments in pull request
 puffin444	Absolutely
 puffin444	I have been reading your comments.
 heiko1	(but I dont know how currently, complex thing)
 heiko1	I also just added some thoughts on the general approach
 puffin444	heiko, perhaps murmur would be better?
 puffin444	If I interpret this correctly, I can call CHash::IncrementalMurmurHash incrementally
 heiko1	yeah could do that
 heiko1	you would need to extend it a bit
 heiko1	so that you can specify an address and a number of bytes
 puffin444	sounds like a simple thing to do.
 heiko1	yeah, the more complicated thing is not to loose the overview :)
 heiko1	have a look at the serialisation code first
 heiko1	thats pretty complicated
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@81.28.187.0] has joined #shogun
 heiko1	many cases
 puffin444	Doesn't serialization lead to the same problem? I'm doing the copying again, instead this time its for something to be written on disc.
 heiko1	yes
 heiko1	you can write to memory
 heiko1	ybut i meant the way the parameters are visited
 heiko1	because its exectly the same problem: print/hash values of all parameters (including sub-parameters, vectors/matrices etc)
 puffin444	Yes. I can't find the class that does this. What's its name?
 heiko1	SGObject starts the process
 heiko1	save_serializable or so
 puffin444	Oh now I see.
 heiko1	I meant just for inspiration
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes?
 heiko1	you dont need to go into everything, just for getting a feeling for all the cases
@sonney2k	blackburn, well I always received these emails -guess why I spend so much time fixing issues others create?

@sonney2k	what n4nd0 posted...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I thought it is your homepage first
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	I personally would choose a different style for obvious reasons
@sonney2k	it is maybe not such a bright idea to connect shogun too much with myself
 n4nd0	yeah ... sure
@sonney2k	I dont' want this project to end if I loose interest or so
 n4nd0	the guy who is working on it will appear around soon and ask which one you like
 heiko1	sonney2k, I like the tabs
 heiko1	design - dont know
 heiko1	I dont like the archive links
 blackburn	sonney2k: hahah what do you expect if you loose interest then
 heiko1	they are messy and people are probably not interested in that
 heiko1	actually I would remove this sidebar
 heiko1	I like the categories
 heiko1	What would be nice would be a feature list, which is a bit nicer to overview that the main text
 heiko1	gotta catch train, see you later
@sonney2k	blackburn, there are enough people nowadays that know their way around in shogun

 blackburn	really?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, so we had some brief discussion - basically we have a webtemplate clash (the one you used is also the one I use on my homepage and shogun should not be too connect to me)
@sonney2k	so I would prefer http://www.nuviotemplates.com/template/gr8-01/

 bern4rd	the basic stuff yes
 bern4rd	but i suppose you want to add more things
 bern4rd	maybe a blog to allow your developers comment their work
 bern4rd	right now the webpage is only showing content so is not too difficult
@sonney2k	bern4rd, but that is all not so important compared to the redesign
@sonney2k	bern4rd, so the admin users can edit this content right?
 bern4rd	yes yes I know, i will use the template gr8-01
@sonney2k	bern4rd, no what I meant is going from the old page to something new
@sonney2k	not the cry* style to gr8 change
@sonney2k	bern4rd, I am impressed already how much work you invested...

 bern4rd	as we set the deadline on wednesday can I continue working on it?
@sonney2k	bern4rd, sure sure
@sonney2k	bern4rd, just come here for updates and discussions

@sonney2k	I would say you convert to gr8-01 first

 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea what is wrong with octave modular
 blackburn	sonney2k: PARALLEL
@sonney2k	what is run in parallel?
@sonney2k	blackburn, with directors or w/o?
 blackburn	sonney2k: get_feature_vector
 blackburn	operator= running in parallel does BOOM
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have a few possible solutions in mind
 blackburn	disable parallel for sparse, synchronize at sparsefeatures or synchronize ref in sgrefdata
 blackburn	sonney2k: your choice?
@sonney2k	blackburn, it should crash not only in octave
@sonney2k	we indeed have a couple of algos that are running in parallel for sparse stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: does distance_sparseeuclidean_modular.py work on your machine?
@sonney2k	no idea
 blackburn	I am pretty sure it fails in octave for this reason

@sonney2k	blackburn, well this example should compute the distance matrix in parallel
@sonney2k	though I see conflicts only on diagonal
 blackburn	sonney2k: so?
 blackburn	we need synchronization here
@sonney2k	yes
 blackburn	where?
@sonney2k	same overhead as in SGObject
 blackburn	I'll add it to sparsefeatures then
@sonney2k	phtread_mutex_t is 40 bytes
@sonney2k	spinlock is just int
@sonney2k	so 4 bytes
@sonney2k	so 4 more bytes are OK I would say
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'll add it to get_feature_vector then
@sonney2k	blackburn, so do the same as in sgobject in sgreferenced data
 blackburn	not to sgrefdata
 blackburn	do you think so?
 blackburn	I don't mind any
@sonney2k	yeah, we will run into other issues and 4 bytes per vector is something we have to live with
@sonney2k	yes shogun won't be fastest this way when we have 3 dimensional data sets
@sonney2k	but why would one need billions of examples to get accurate estimates for such low dim data anyways?
@sonney2k	so we are now at 16 byte overhead
@sonney2k	and if we are really unhappy with it we can of course change things later
 blackburn	sonney2k: argh what is behavior on =?
 blackburn	there should be pointer on lock I guess?

@sonney2k	blackburn, ???
@sonney2k	blackburn, whenever the refcount stuff is changed we need the spinlock
 blackburn	sonney2k: just like reference counter it should be shared between vectors/matrices
@sonney2k	ahh
@sonney2k	kaboom
 blackburn	why so?
@sonney2k	ok maybe it is not too bad
@sonney2k	just create a struct with the refcount and spinlock
@sonney2k	and alloc this in SGReferencedData
 blackburn	why struct?
@sonney2k	so the former refcount ptr points there
@sonney2k	blackburn, how could it work otherwise?
@sonney2k	you need a lock for the refcount
@sonney2k	and you need to share it among SGVectors
 blackburn	sonney2k: just track both separately
@sonney2k	why that?
@sonney2k	then you have 2 ptrs and 2 ints
@sonney2k	with a struct you will only have 1 ptr and 2 ints
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	8 bytes saved
 blackburn	ok makes sense
@sonney2k	I hope there is no race condition accessing *ptr though
 blackburn	whoops
 blackburn	hah
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	lets see
 blackburn	I don't think there is
 blackburn	sonney2k: I actually have pointers to locks in LTSA/LLE/blahblah
 blackburn	works nice I believe
@sonney2k	yeah lets hope so
@sonney2k	actually it should be fine... only race condition would be when the struct is destroyed
@sonney2k	but this can only happen when only one object is available
@sonney2k	so all good
@sonney2k	let me break the build just for the fun of it

 blackburn	compiling
 gsomix	Ok, we have add_to_dense_sgvec(blabla, SGVector<float64_t>, blabla) method. If this method is called form C++ side, we get SGVector object on python side. Instead numpy array.
 gsomix	SGVector have `+=' and `+' operators, so:
 gsomix	SGVector+=numpy_array - works proper
 gsomix	SGVector+=SGVector - fail, because SGVector is not numpy array, as required by typemaps.
 gsomix	I tried to use directorin/out typemaps, but it's fail. It seems there is bug in swig2.0.4. Next I installed swig2.0.7 and got segfault in compilation.
 gsomix	And last. I tried to use directored features in svm - fail:
 gsomix	>> dsvm.train()
 gsomix	TypeError: not a numpy vector of appropriate type
 gsomix	I think it's related to method with SGVector<>.

@sonney2k	at least the mainboard led is on / network led too afterwards
@sonney2k	so the board seems to be OK
@sonney2k	but who knows...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I was just looking at your patch
 blackburn	and?
@sonney2k	I am a bit concerned that init_data() is called in a pthread lock thing
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	(which is a busy loop)
@sonney2k	better store the refcount before
 blackburn	init_data is basically two 'mov' in all our structures
@sonney2k	then free etc
 blackburn	free should be inside LOCK
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	whoops
 blackburn	wrong here for sure
@sonney2k	I mean if it is 0
@sonney2k	then there really is no one else fiddling with the object
@sonney2k	not now and cannot be in future
 blackburn	sonney2k: bug here anyway
 blackburn	return before unlock
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	better do int c = m_refcount->rc; directly after the decrement
@sonney2k	and then unlock
@sonney2k	and do whatever necessary
 blackburn	I feel too lazy to think about it
 blackburn	will just check whether it works
@sonney2k	blackburn, err what is line 107ff doing?
 blackburn	sonney2k: so you mean in thready case rc will never be zero?
@sonney2k	shouldn't it be ifndef ?
 blackburn	oops
@sonney2k	blackburn, no why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am concerned with free out of pthread lock
@sonney2k	blackburn, if the refcount is 0
@sonney2k	then we free right?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	so it means that this is the only object still available
 blackburn	sonney2k: but how do we guarantee we free only once?
@sonney2k	no one else can have one
 blackburn	looks like
 blackburn	sonney2k: what if we have two copies
 blackburn	ref = 2
 blackburn	they both decrement ref
 blackburn	to zero
@sonney2k	that cannot happen
@sonney2k	one will decrement first
@sonney2k	so only one of them can call free
 blackburn	sonney2k: should be better now

 blackburn	ah destroy..
 blackburn	yeah makes sense
@sonney2k	gsomix, please still send the weekly report...
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw I would like to get rid of spinlocks
@sonney2k	blackburn, no!
@sonney2k	why that?
 gsomix	sonney2k, aha
 blackburn	they are unsafe - 100% cpu load for ever in case of glitch
@sonney2k	why unsafe?
@sonney2k	pthread mutexes have huge overhead
@sonney2k	in particular for these *fast* refcount inc/decrefs
@sonney2k	spinlocks are much much better suited

 blackburn	sonney2k: we don't need fast in sgobject in particular
 blackburn	I'll become mad soon - when will it work finally?
@sonney2k	well we use it to compute combined kernels etc
 blackburn	sonney2k: any idea why it hangs?
@sonney2k	blackburn, relax and do sth else maybe - doc stuff?

 blackburn	sonney2k: I have gsoc project here you know :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahum that is why you do SGSparse :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not really remember why did I do that
 blackburn	ahhh chris pushed me in these swarms full of monsters and dragons
@sonney2k	I guess because you promised at some point and then because you merged the broken commit from chris?
 blackburn	oh you are so positive :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I finally know why R fails
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	it requires R >= 2.13
@sonney2k	and on bb is 2.11
@sonney2k	it would have worked with 2.11 if we had the old .r-install.sh script though
 blackburn	no idea about it
@sonney2k	well R 2.11 is from 2010
@sonney2k	and they do such nice things like renaming .saveRDS to saveRDS
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have seen R code a few times
 blackburn	and I don't want to anymore
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	I finally understand why it worked all good here
@sonney2k	R 2.15 ...
@sonney2k	I think we need to support the old version again :/
 gsomix	good night guys
 n4nd0	good night gsomix
