 foulwall	Hi iglesiasg sonney2k
 foulwall	There is something weird, the GaussianLikehood class can be imported from my local machine, but the same thing cannot be imported on my server
 foulwall	I've used the same command making the shogun, and almost the same version of numpy and scipy.
 foulwall	Is there any special configure options for the GaussianLikehood class?
 foulwall	sorry GaussianLikelihood

@iglesiasg	foulwall: mmm not that I know honestly
@iglesiasg	let me check
@iglesiasg	foulwall: is Eigen3 in your server?
@iglesiasg	I see that GaussianLikelihood is guarded by ifdef HAVE_EIGEN3

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hello, are you here?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: as I said, I will finish the test on Monday, but I was thinking ahead of what to do next, and the issue https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/946 (Develop an adapter for t-SNE) looked suitable. Is it open/is there any blockers for this issue?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: the only blocker is that I should update the code
@lisitsyn	I'll do it today
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, then I will take this issue next, if you do not mind. I guess, this task is pretty similar to "Change kPCA to use the Tapkee library", so the steps would be pretty similar?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, thanks for you answers)
@lisitsyn	votjakovr: Heiko will answer your mail rather soon so keep calm ;)
 votjakovr	lisitsyn: Thanks:)

@sonney2k	saket, I haven't done this yet from a student perspective it might be that you don't have to finish the feature but just ask for a PR
@sonney2k	for that branch
 saket	I did a PR (https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/994 ) but i @iglesias asked to do it via git flow
 saket	sonney2k: I request you to please guide me here .. @iglesias said that you will be able to help better in the second last comment on the thread in the above PR
@sonney2k	saket, just don't do the PR against master but develp!
@sonney2k	develop
 saket	ohh
 saket	thanks

 sijin_	I just wonder whether i should change tapkee_shougun.cpp file since I don't find the support for KPCA in TAPKEE_METHODS_FOR_SHOGUN
@lisitsyn	sijin_: yes but I'd have to update tapkee
@lisitsyn	sijin_: is that you asked this quetion in the issue?
 sijin_	yes, it's me
@lisitsyn	alright
@lisitsyn	sijin_: I have to update the library and then we can continue
@lisitsyn	I didn't foresee we need an out-of-sample projection
 sijin_	ok , i will check out, thx @lisitsyn
@lisitsyn	sijin_: if there is anything else you would like to contibute with you may do that meanwhile
 abinash	anyone help me out in adding a newly created example in the makefile in examples directory
 sijin_	okay.
@lisitsyn	abinash: libshogun examples?
 abinash	lisitsyn: yes libshogun examples
@lisitsyn	abinash: just put that example to the list in makefile
 abinash	which make file, the make file in examples directory or the one present in libshogun directory
@lisitsyn	abinash: shogun/examples/undocumented/libshogun/Makefile
 abinash	I have added the one in documented example
@lisitsyn	*un*documented, documented examples are generated
 abinash	so shouldn't it be shogun/examples/documented/libshogun/Makefile
 abinash	ok thank you

@sonney2k	for the clustering!
 foulwall_	sonney2k: thanks
@sonney2k	foulwall_, btw one thing - I tried the clustering demo today from firefox
@sonney2k	it doesn't work
@sonney2k	I cannot click with the left mouse button
@sonney2k	nothing appears
 foulwall_	I'll do some browser check tomorrow.
@sonney2k	foulwall_, thanks
 foulwall_	sonney2k: have you tried the svr demo?
@sonney2k	foulwall_, ohh yes
@sonney2k	it works in firefox
@sonney2k	and it morpsh
@sonney2k	morpsh

 foulwall_	I'm doing some debug job for the gp regression.
 gsomix	foulwall_, sonney2k, good evening. where can I check demos for shogun now?
@sonney2k	I am currently thinking about creating 2 projects
@sonney2k	out of this
 gsomix	I mean online demos.
 foulwall_	sonney2k: I knew that. His work's excellent too.
@sonney2k	gsomix, sec
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, foulwall_: hi
@sonney2k	gsomix, http://shogun-toolbox.org/demos/svr/entrance
@sonney2k	gsomix,  http://shogun-toolbox.org/demos/clustering/entrance
 gsomix	sonney2k, thanks
@sonney2k	gsomix, that is foulwall_ 's work
@sonney2k	and then dvalcarce did http://shogun-toolbox.org/demos/classification/index
 foulwall_	Maybe I can do some mldata integration, whatever I have a whole summer's time
 dvalcarce	foulwall and me thought about spliting the project if it is possible
 foulwall_	Hi dvalcarce
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I have a couple of ideas - not sure who of you would prefer what
@sonney2k	I don't really know what your background is foulwall_ / dvalcarce
@sonney2k	so one is more or less the original plan
@sonney2k	do graphical demos for everythign that is in shogun
@sonney2k	lets mark it:
@sonney2k	1) do graphical demos for everythign that is in shogun
@sonney2k	2) do shogun applications
@sonney2k	that would be the ocr demo we have on the website (currently written in pyqt & shogun)
@sonney2k	and a couple of tools from bioinformatics
@sonney2k	and maybe some more we can think of
@sonney2k	3) do a machine learning web framework
@sonney2k	that would mean - people could upload their data
@sonney2k	define the task underneath
@sonney2k	and shogun would come up with some predictions
@sonney2k	difficulty ranges from 1) easy 2) medium 3) tough
@sonney2k	foulwall_, dvalcarce any thoughts / preferences?
 dvalcarce	all ideas seem interesting to me
 foulwall_	I prefer the 2)
 dvalcarce	idea 1 would be (more or less) the task we are doing right now?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://www.aibirds.org/ :)
 rgirish28	hi sonney2k, hope I can also join the discussion
@sonney2k	foulwall_, 1) yes
 dvalcarce	shogun applications means shogun "desktop" applications?
@sonney2k	rgirish28, hey there
 rgirish28	The machine learning web framework seems like an awesome idea.
 dvalcarce	btw, i like idea 3
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, no via the web but of course the difference is rather small - there is some gui frontend done on the web site
 foulwall_	sonney2k: But I dont clear what's the framework running on.
@sonney2k	and some backend done in python
@sonney2k	that is using shogun for the computation heavy stuff
 foulwall_	sonney2k: PaaS?
@sonney2k	foulwall_, yeah kind of
@sonney2k	or SaaS - we ship the code with it so one could do that locally
 foulwall_	sonney2k: So that is  kind of challenging
@sonney2k	yes it is
@sonney2k	one could start with very simple steps first though
@sonney2k	like a) just read in .csv files
@sonney2k	assuming everything is numeric
 dvalcarce	it can be useful in laboratory environments
@sonney2k	then consider what the target value is
 dvalcarce	a powerful computer can run the server side
@sonney2k	if it is a regression or classification task
 dvalcarce	and scientists uploads their data via web
@sonney2k	and then run some algorithm on top of that end store the model
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, yeah or streaming via url
@sonney2k	then one could do the same with e.g. textural features and also allow more options
@sonney2k	like what you do now in the demos
@sonney2k	some values to tweak
@sonney2k	with some nice doc
 foulwall_	dvalcarce: what do you think
 rgirish28	right, so basically porting the whole toolbox to the web
 rgirish28	with demos, maybe a gui, the works. i suppose?
@sonney2k	rgirish28, not porting - but creating an interface to it. That would allow people who don't know much about data science to benefit from that
 dvalcarce	foulwall_: i think i prefer idea #3, but i also like ideas 1 and 2
 dvalcarce	and you?
 foulwall_	sonney2k: just the same to you.
 foulwall_	sonney2k: sorry
 foulwall_	dvalcarce: just the same to you
 rgirish28	right.
 dvalcarce	haha
 rgirish28	that would be quite ambitious. but extremely interesting.
@sonney2k	yes it is ambitious - but there is time until end of september
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ah so you are getting to my idea!
@lisitsyn	:D
 foulwall_	sonney2k: framework means what? easy interface
 rgirish28	so would that be in python for backend
@sonney2k	and I think some basic .csv upload / training some model would barely take a few days
 rgirish28	?
@sonney2k	of course there are all kinds of issues like potentially user management etc but having written mldata.org / mloss.org I know it is not difficult w/ django
@sonney2k	rgirish28, yes
 rgirish28	right
 rgirish28	sonney2k, I'm also interested in the fast food implementation. very interesting optimisation.
 dvalcarce	yeah, django is amazing for web development
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no you wanted to do some distributed learning - I want a ML learning platform
 foulwall_	sonney2k: I'm interested in that.
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I have some comments/bug reports about your demo
 dvalcarce	tell me
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, File "/home/shogun/django/shogun/demos/classification.py", line 51, in run_multiclass
@sonney2k	    width = json.loads(request.GET["width"])

@sonney2k	MultiValueDictKeyError: 'Key \'width\' not found
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, an also something is wrong with your coordinate system
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: isn't that the same?
@sonney2k	IIRC it is between 0 and 1
@sonney2k	but underneath it seems to be much much different
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, points you give to shogun should also have the 0...1 scale
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, then the value for sigma would be much more sane in the ~ 1 range
 dvalcarce	sonney2k: ok, let me check
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no it is not like prepare jobs - execute
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, that would be for experts again
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: how do you see that then
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, if you want it is just a GUI
 gsomix	foulwall_, nice demos. but I have error in svr.
 gsomix	with linear kernel

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, all closed
@sonney2k	and you forgot google predict
@sonney2k	microsoft and all the other big guys doing sth similar
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we will never reach that being open source :D
@lisitsyn	well not really open source issue
@lisitsyn	it is about funding and a way to get money from that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I don't know what you mean
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, last time I heard a talk from the bigml guy
@sonney2k	it was just decision trees
 rgirish28	sonney2k, who can I talk to regarding the fast food implementation
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: it is not possible to develop such a thing during our spare time
@lisitsyn	what's what I mean
@sonney2k	so surely we can do sth similar
@lisitsyn	that*
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, why not?

@sonney2k	it is easy
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: depends - UI is not easy
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, look mldata/mloss.org were not that much work
@sonney2k	maybe 1-2 months
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but it was developed when you were 'free' right?
@sonney2k	yes?
@sonney2k	but if say dvalcarce would do it he would be too
@sonney2k	and he would get support from us
@lisitsyn	yes syre
@lisitsyn	sure
@sonney2k	and you have seen how much he did already *without* asking anything
@sonney2k	IMHO it just needs some plan on how to solve the most simple tasks first
@lisitsyn	I am sorry I am a little out of it
 foulwall_	sonney2k: How much work time would you like me to spend a day?
@lisitsyn	20-22 hours per day of course ;)
 foulwall_	sonney2k: 10 hours a day in the summer ?
@sonney2k	foulwall_, normal working hours
@lisitsyn	bah
@lisitsyn	10?
@sonney2k	foulwall_, lisitsyn is joking of course
@sonney2k	it is supposed to be fun too
 foulwall_	bah, 10 hours is just the normal time.
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: would you like to work 10 hours at tomtom? ;)
@lisitsyn	:D
 foulwall_	sonney2k: we Chinese people got crazy in summer.
 dvalcarce	haha
@lisitsyn	I usually get a hour or more late to job and it is kinda 6 hours per day
@lisitsyn	and I do get tired
@sonney2k	foulwall_, 8 hours/day is normal in germany so I don't expect more but hey it all depends
@lisitsyn	foulwall_: well if it doesn't burn you out
@sonney2k	when stuff is /really/ fun (like when you do research) then it can happen that you forget the world around you
@sonney2k	rgirish28, me
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: have you heard anything about 'alfa' hotel in berlin?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, no - maybe you better take some hostel no?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: an agency found that and '?njoy hotel berlin city messe'
 foulwall_	sonney2k: I can guaranty that all summer.
@lisitsyn	costs are pretty reasonable
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, didn't know you got rich :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: it costs less than *one* ticket to berlin
@lisitsyn	for two of us

 dvalcarce	sonney2k, from spain
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: the cheapest airflight from here to berlin is ~450$
@lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	Spanish majority around here! ^_^
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: if things are going well I am in berlin on the night of 9th, July
@sonney2k	foulwall_, yeah well so shogun gets around the clock development :)
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, you know each other?
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, i don't think so
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: not before he appeared around here, I didn't have the pleasure
@iglesiasg	dvalcarce: hola hola BTW :)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: do you mean all spains know each other? ;)

 dvalcarce	igleasiasg, hola! :)
@iglesiasg	that's racist man :P
@iglesiasg	jk
 dvalcarce	lol
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: if you was a mentor you would get quite a lot candidates from spain I am sure
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, :P
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: you think so? why?
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, dvalcarce I thought there are only 2 left of you

@sonney2k	gsomix, does it work for you now?
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, coudl you make sense of the issue?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well friday 12th is the date and may be two days at TU
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
@iglesiasg	it is one day workshop and 2 internal days?
@iglesiasg	ok
@sonney2k	very far away
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, i'm not able to reproduce your issue
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: how far from the workshop place?
 dvalcarce	however, there isn't the last version at http://shogun-toolbox.org/demos/classification/multiclass
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: these two days after the workshop at TU are more or less confirmed?
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: I remember you said you were not going to be able to be around though :S
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: BTW has anyone from KTH CVAP registered? I am curious

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: no AFAIK
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, I've forwarded you the backtrace
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no one from KTH
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: how many have applied so far?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: 9
@sonney2k	dvalcarce, could you also please check if the range of the points is sane
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, 10 :)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: -1
@sonney2k	but none of us
@sonney2k	I know that cheng will come

@sonney2k	yes
@lisitsyn	would be nice to see him
@sonney2k	and gunnar obviously and well I hope n4nd0 and you and heiko too
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: so will I be able to get to hotel after our party? :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, too far away
@sonney2k	take sth more central
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: Ufnaustrasse 1
@lisitsyn	better/
@lisitsyn	?
@iglesiasg	sure I am going for sure
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, http://www.ostel.eu/
@sonney2k	if you want east german style :)
@sonney2k	very close
@iglesiasg	hostel yaaay
 dvalcarce	sonney2k, i am working on range values right now
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: I do not feel the difference between hostel and hotel
@lisitsyn	:D
@iglesiasg	price :)
@lisitsyn	and?
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it can't be just price right? :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: well I think in a hostel it is normal that food is not included
@lisitsyn	ahh
@iglesiasg	there is normally a small kitchen or so
@iglesiasg	it looks like that place has nothing available those days unfortunately
@iglesiasg	there must me others too of course

@sonney2k	abhi_iit_10691, and if you want to start working - we need the basics
@lisitsyn	well that's ok if it far away - is your public transport ok in berlin, sonney2k?
@sonney2k	abhi_iit_10691, e.g. write some function that can split up a text document based on some tokens
@sonney2k	abhi_iit_10691, so we can later on-the-fly compute the hash of the words or n-grams

@lisitsyn	vgorbati: alright
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: hmm ostel costs pretty the same
@sonney2k	rgirish28, well there are a couple of things one can do to get faster training for kernel classifiers
@sonney2k	rgirish28, one is to use a linear svm (usually very fast!)
 rgirish28	yeh but linear sum only work for linear data
 rgirish28	svms
@sonney2k	and compute some approximation of features (aka kernel expansion)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ok when you will get me to hotel by car, okay? ;) hahah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: U must be subway in the map
@iglesiasg	tunnelbanet ~ tunnelbana
 rgirish28	right
@lisitsyn	is that ok to get drunk and ride through the city in your country sonney2k?
@lisitsyn	may be some gunfire

 saket	but just out of curiosity and general discussion, wasn't it incorrect to have 2/3 classes having the same name in the same namepsace?

@lisitsyn	saket: it is in shogun/lib/tapkee/... because tapkee is kind of 'separate' library
@lisitsyn	saket: as for shogun/lib/v_array.h - yes it should be removed I guess
 saket	ohh
 saket	sorry to bug again ...but i need a little help ...make runs fine in /src/shogun ... but exits with error in /src/
 saket	'make'
 saket	 " /lib/v_array.h:40:25: error: candidates are: template<class T> class shogun::shogun_v_array::v_array" is the error and v_array.h:40 is the definition of class
 saket	and if put "template<class T> class shogun::shogun_v_array::v_array" as the definition then it gives "../shogun/lib/v_array.h:41:1: error: qualified name does not name a class before '{' token" ...
 saket	any help?
