 sonne|work	blackburn: I didn't see your commit unfortunately
 n4nd0	sonne|work: why do you prefer to use master directly?
 sonne|work	because we need to get things back to work before we can switch
 blackburn	sonne|work: that's a secret plan of you - please let us know next time :)
 sonne|work	erm I didn't know we switched already
 sonne|work	I was all the time only doing preparations for the switch

 sumit	blackburn: Just A small doubt , How far has Shogun 2.1.0 progressed in implementing RandNLA algorithms,.?I mean I could trace Lapack.cpp eigen3 though,,any clues for ERROR ANALYSIS?MATRIX MULTIPLICATION...MATRIX Decomposition??Divided Differences?Integration formulae,EigenValue Algos etc etc?
 n4nd0	sumit: where are you getting that error?
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@dslb-088-075-046-171.pools.arcor-ip.net] has quit [Read error: Connection reset by peer]
 sumit	Well I had a glance on GsoC 2013 Ideas List - and was focussing on Implementing RandNLA algorithms,,I think there's much more to it , for SHOGUN TOOLBOX,,as in many algorithms yet to be implemented in Shogun,isn't it?
 sumit	I thence just wanted to know if I was missing out on some already implemented ones..
 n4nd0	aham ok
 n4nd0	I completely misunderstood, sorry
 sumit	its ok :)
 n4nd0	I don't know much about RandNLA, let's see what blackburn can tell you about it
 sumit	Well,,so I was about to contact the concerned mentors,,but was trying to understand Shogun Structure,,And I think this is a promising area to work in,isn't it?I am sending the wiki link,,I wish to contribute by implementing some arrays of algorithms enlisted in there
 blackburn	sumit: nothing is implemented yet
 n4nd0	sumit: sure, feel free to contribute. That would be great
 sumit	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numerical_analysis_topics ,, Yes thanks :),,,So blackburn , I will send you an email wherein I shall discuss the approach and other details , thanks :)
 blackburn	sumit: we are waiting for some response from Igor
 blackburn	sumit: feel free to email him and CC me
 blackburn	that's cool there is a list of topics but we should understand what to implement and what for :)
 sumit	blackburn: Sure Sir
 sumit	Yes Yes, I was just about to send the mail to you both

 ZeThomas	hey, quick question
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: shoot
 ZeThomas	is there a way to do leave-one-out testing/validation efficiently (with SVMLight, or others)?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: mm no sure, have you taken a look to the evaluation module?
 n4nd0	I'm not* sure
 ZeThomas	yeah, I've been browsing the docs for some time now, can't really find something
 ZeThomas	but maybe I'm overlooking
 sonne|work	ZeThomas: no
 ZeThomas	and this kind of machine, described here: http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-99%20VOL-2/PDF/011.pdf
 ZeThomas	how could I implement this, is there a way to alter some of the elements in a kernel matrix?
 ZeThomas	(because I just need to put diagonals to 0)
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: I guess there must be a way to do it, but it probably depends on the machine you want to use
 ZeThomas	say I want a SVMLight with GaussianRBF, but I want to set all diagonal elements of the kernel matrix to zero before I train
 ZeThomas	how would I best do this? tinker with the values of a GaussianKernel object (if possible), or subclass it maybe?
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: let me check a second
 n4nd0	ZeThomas: maybe CustomKernel can help you

 lambday	n4nd0: hi
 lambday	heiko: hello
 lambday	I have removed the SSK String kernel
 heiko	lambday:  hi, have you pushed to your PR?
 heiko	lambday: nice, I just saw it
 lambday	one question - does doxygen support amsmath specific latex equation? say, \begin{align*}?
 heiko	lambday: I dont know, you can try it out :)
 heiko	but usually we just use the std \[ \] stuff
 heiko	lambday: okay, looks good, now unit test and
 heiko	then Ill merge
 lambday	heiko: okay... I am doing make doc.. I thought it would be nice to describe it the way you did :)
 heiko	the way I did?
 lambday	on the issues page - step by step..
 lambday	log of sum over diagonal evements times 2
 lambday	elements*
 heiko	ah I see, yes you can do that
 heiko	would be good!
 lambday	heiko: will let you know if it works.. will start with the unit test then

 heiko	lambday: sorry was out for lunch
 heiko	lambday: make unit-tests does it for you
 heiko	or make in the tests/unit folder
 heiko	and make valgrind in the unit/folder runs valgrind for the tests (some of them leak)(
 heiko	make valgrind-per-module runs them seperately to hunt for memory leaks easier
 heiko	lambday: a few things on committing
 heiko	when you do a pull, always use pull --rebase
 heiko	otherwise our commit history is messed up
 heiko	also, never do commit -a, you dont want to commit anything else than source files
 heiko	sorry, you will have to remove all the documentation commits (see PR)
-!- sonne|work [~sonnenbu@sams-office-nat.tomtomgroup.com] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 lambday	heiko: okay.. I was wondering why the other files got changed, because I didn't change anything in them..
 heiko	your doxygen changed them
 heiko	lambday: just commit your code changes seperately, then you will have no problems
 lambday	heiko: okay.. so, I have to do a rollback on my forked repo?
 lambday	and add the documentation later on and commit again?
 heiko	no, never commit the documentation
 heiko	only the doxygen comments
 heiko	we generate automatically
 heiko	only commit the interface and the implementation of your method
 heiko	(and then unit-test)
 heiko	nothing else
 heiko	never do commit -a
 heiko	lambday: sorry for all this mess, but this is exactly why we have these intro tasks :)
 lambday	heiko: I am sorry for making this mess :( totally new to github..
 heiko	lambday:  dont worry, I had exactly the same problems in the beginning :D
 lambday	heiko: hope to get a grip on git asap :)
 heiko	you will
 lambday	and you mean I should only commit the source files, right? I did git commit -a and that seems to mess it all up
 lambday	heiko: if I want to reset the state of the repo right after a previous commit, should "git reset <commit-code>" do it?
 heiko	yes, but please make a copy of your changes to not accidentally loose anything
 lambday	heiko: okay..

 blackburn	sonney2k: that's ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: they won't take a look at ideas for a few days I think
 blackburn	sonney2k: April 1 - 5:Google program administrators review organization proposals.
 blackburn	sonney2k: so we've got a weekend to polish before they take a look
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am able to do that at least
 blackburn	so no worries we are ok
 lambday	heiko: I have reverted to the point before it got messy. and then updated Statistics.h.. please check..
 lambday	heiko: writing unit test would mean, I have to write a file with TEST(Statistics, log_det) {...} with a small matrix and test whether log_det returns the value as expected, using EXPECT_EQ??
 lambday	and then run unit-tests and check for memory leaks using valgrind?

 heiko	lambday: yes, just like the existing tests
 lambday	heiko: okay.. there is no test for mathematics, so should I create a directory "mathematics" in tests/unit and put the cc file there?
 heiko	lambday: there should be one for statistics
 lambday	yes there is..

@sonney2k	blackburn, well what 'simple' tasks do we have?
@sonney2k	IMHO some file i/o stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: we don't have simple tasks at all I am afraid
@sonney2k	some write examples
@sonney2k	with python / django underneath and d3js

 blackburn	I mean how it looks like
@sonney2k	never tried
@sonney2k	blackburn, we need that for test coverage...
 blackburn	sonney2k: let me show you, a minute
@sonney2k	but I guess for now it is more important to get the build back to green
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have learned how to work with it in tapkee so I'll put it to shogun
@sonney2k	we still have flaky tests in basically all static interfaces
 blackburn	oh right
@sonney2k	and then octave_modular and some in python_modular
 blackburn	sonney2k: we need more modularity
@sonney2k	I hope I managed to get the buildbot working as I wanted
@sonney2k	blackburn, what do you mean?
 blackburn	sonney2k: may be it would be better to make things less coupled somehow
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not like implementations right in classes
@sonney2k	blackburn, you are talking about multiple shogun libs?
@sonney2k	or what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah may be that
 blackburn	sonney2k: I feel classes should be adapters for real core
 blackburn	it feels improper to have god classes
 blackburn	sonney2k: a good rule is <20 lines per method right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah yes and I still dream about client-server shogun

 blackburn	sonney2k: do you know anything about remote method invocation in java? that is used in EJB
 blackburn	so class you own could be just a stub that calls a method remotely
 blackburn	I can't get rid it could be a crazy feature
@sonney2k	blackburn, heh with static interfaces this would even be possible :D
@sonney2k	just send over the command and it will do
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is possible with modular as well
 blackburn	sonney2k: I think I have an idea how can we speed up compilation and improve code
 blackburn	sonney2k: we could put all class fields into some say 'context'
 blackburn	that stores all the data as may be map?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you are having some epiphany ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes jesus and allah are here tell me what to do
@sonney2k	blackburn, thats what we have with parameters
@sonney2k	and then?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean private fields are not exposed in headers
 blackburn	sonney2k: won't that help swig to be faster?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't know whether I understood you correctly but your suggestion is to put all member variables into a single map (one per class?)
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah somewhat
 blackburn	it could be generic though
@sonney2k	that won't help swig though, IIRC swig is not exposing access to non-public variables
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm alright
@sonney2k	blackburn, what helps with swig is really reducing the number of exposed functions
@sonney2k	and stuff like we have sgvector/matrix/dense/spars/stringfeatures of all kinds of basic types causes an explosing in wrapper code size
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to admit : I hate getters and setters

 blackburn	sometimes
@sonney2k	blackburn, look http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb2%20-%20static_interfaces/builds/842/steps/test%20python_static/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	only few examples fail
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I just checked that
@sonney2k	5
@sonney2k	tests actaully
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh HMM
@sonney2k	blackburn, any idea what we should do to get things green rather quick?
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really
 blackburn	sonney2k: HMM is 5580 lines
 blackburn	that is terrible
 blackburn	I don't know if HMM code can be shorter but that's a dead code unfortunately
@sonney2k	maybe we should blacklist these 5 tests for now
 blackburn	sonney2k: HMM for sure
@sonney2k	and then add the blacklist stuff to the list of quick fixes
@sonney2k	HMM is not quickly fixed though
@sonney2k	(I guess)
 blackburn	sonney2k: same with kernels
 blackburn	I approached these kernels one day
 blackburn	but that's scary as well
@sonney2k	fixing kernels shoudl be much easier I think
@sonney2k	so lets summarize our todo
@sonney2k	1) get proposal ready (most important)
@sonney2k	2) get ideas list ready
@sonney2k	3) get shogun back to green
@sonney2k	4) switch to new dev model and let the games begin
 blackburn	sonney2k: 1) is more or less done - some fixes
@sonney2k	add website changes somewhere in there
@sonney2k	blackburn, so lets finish 1) & 2) tomorrow
 blackburn	sonney2k: alright
@sonney2k	for the rest we likely need help
 blackburn	sonney2k: I will have to write descriptions for igor stuff and vowpal wabbit
@sonney2k	I am progressing very slowly with 3)
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you have time to write some descriptions for static and d3?
@sonney2k	and I a couple more too for the optimization stuff from last year, the fast kernel expansion stuff etc
@sonney2k	lets hope so
 blackburn	I am going to have a busy day at job tomorrow
@sonney2k	but bedtime now
 blackburn	hope will manage to do all the stuff
 blackburn	yeah same for me
 blackburn	good night
