 mikeling	lisitsyn: wiking hi, what's the difference between left hand side and right hand side features?
 mikeling	why we need to define features as left and right hand side ?
 lisitsyn	mikeling: that's a bit tricky
 lisitsyn	the thing is that kernels and distances are defined with two arguments
 lisitsyn	like K(x,x')
 lisitsyn	so there is the first thing and there is the second thing or left and right
 lisitsyn	with a bit of strange training requires you to have K(train, train)
 lisitsyn	so lhs==rhs==train
 lisitsyn	but when you apply kernel SVM you still need your train set
 lisitsyn	in this case it becomes K(train, test)
 lisitsyn	because you're comparing train examples with test examples
 mikeling	 lisitsyn Oh sorry, I just afk for a while, forget to change me irc status to afk.....
 mikeling	but how about the situation in KNN, what's the meaning of lhs and rhs in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/KNN.cpp#L141
 mikeling	furthermore, if we only separate features as lhs and rhs, how could we deal with the numbers of features?

 mikeling	lisitsyn: Hmmm, As to KNN,  If I have a sample named x1 and can been represented as a  4 dimensions vector like <1, 3, 4, 5>, so when I want to use a data set (x2, x3, x4, x5.... which also are 4 dimensions vectors) to classify x1, which is the lhs feature and which are rhs features?
 mikeling	x1 == lhs and x2 == rhs ?
 mikeling	lisitsyn: Shogun is the first ML tool box I used, so I need to learn some more things to get used it :)
