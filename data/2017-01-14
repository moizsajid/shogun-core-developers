mikeling	lisitsyn: wiking hi, what's the difference between left hand side and right hand side features?	07:49
mikeling	why we need to define features as left and right hand side ?	07:50
lisitsyn	mikeling: that's a bit tricky	13:04
lisitsyn	the thing is that kernels and distances are defined with two arguments	13:04
lisitsyn	like K(x,x')	13:04
lisitsyn	so there is the first thing and there is the second thing or left and right	13:05
lisitsyn	with a bit of strange training requires you to have K(train, train)	13:05
lisitsyn	so lhs==rhs==train	13:05
lisitsyn	but when you apply kernel SVM you still need your train set	13:06
lisitsyn	in this case it becomes K(train, test)	13:06
lisitsyn	because you're comparing train examples with test examples	13:06
mikeling	lisitsyn Oh sorry, I just afk for a while, forget to change me irc status to afk.....	14:06
mikeling	but how about the situation in KNN, what's the meaning of lhs and rhs in https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/KNN.cpp#L141	14:13
mikeling	furthermore, if we only separate features as lhs and rhs, how could we deal with the numbers of features?	14:14

mikeling	lisitsyn: Hmmm, As to KNN,  If I have a sample named x1 and can been represented as a  4 dimensions vector like <1, 3, 4, 5>, so when I want to use a data set (x2, x3, x4, x5.... which also are 4 dimensions vectors) to classify x1, which is the lhs feature and which are rhs features?	15:04
mikeling	x1 == lhs and x2 == rhs ?	15:04
mikeling	lisitsyn: Shogun is the first ML tool box I used, so I need to learn some more things to get used it :)	15:08
