 sanuj	HeikoS, yo
@HeikoS	sanuj: jojo
 sanuj	what's up
@HeikoS	sanuj: not too much :)
@HeikoS	catching up with things
@HeikoS	and you?
 sanuj	recovering :)
 sanuj	HeikoS, can you see this https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3328
@HeikoS	recovering from?
 sanuj	cold and viral fever
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	get well soon!
 sanuj	yeah
 sanuj	i'm almost well
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	oh
@HeikoS	I realised I forgot to put them in
@HeikoS	let me push
 sanuj	HeikoS, okay!

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: not test long real vector for now, travis doesn't like it
 sanuj	HeikoS, btw
 sanuj	i got an intern
 sanuj	http://camp.lcsr.jhu.edu/intern/
@HeikoS	internship you mean?
@HeikoS	US
@HeikoS	cool!
@HeikoS	thatll be cool
 sanuj	yeah internship
 sanuj	let's see
 sanuj	i hope i get visa
 sanuj	HeikoS, it's for 9 months
 sanuj	starting in september
@HeikoS	great
@HeikoS	is it paid?
 sanuj	HeikoS, they said 1000 usd
 sanuj	approx
 sanuj	a friend told me not enough to survive there
 sanuj	haha
@HeikoS	pcm?
@HeikoS	yeah careful with that
 sanuj	HeikoS, pcm?
@HeikoS	per calendar month
 sanuj	oh i see
 sanuj	yes i think
 sanuj	HeikoS, this is also a cool lab mila.umontreal.ca
 sanuj	for deep learning
 sanuj	yoshua bengio
 sanuj	HeikoS, talking about tags
 sanuj	i think we should go full throttle with the conversion of old classes to  use tags on a feature branch
@HeikoS	yeah thats a cool lab
@HeikoS	conversion as in?
 sanuj	HeikoS, to use tags parameter framework
 sanuj	instead of SG_ADD
 sanuj	use register_param
@HeikoS	I think we might want to change SG_ADD?
@HeikoS	no?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ^
 sanuj	lisitsyn, is away
 sanuj	HeikoS, we can remove parameter.h and SG_ADD
@HeikoS	sanuj: ah yes
@HeikoS	sanuj: but then we have to replace every SG_ADD in shogun
@HeikoS	that is kind of a lot of work ;)
 sanuj	:D
@HeikoS	oh and btw
@HeikoS	if we remove Parameter.h
@HeikoS	then our serialization doesnt work anymore
 sanuj	oh
@HeikoS	so what I would do for now, is just adding things
@HeikoS	and once everything works, we can remove the old stuff
@HeikoS	but if SG_ADD would register parameter to both your and the old framework, that might be a good first step
@HeikoS	did you already try to replace a couple of SG_ADD instances?
@HeikoS	did that work?
@HeikoS	I think it might be a good idea to get a feeling for how the build behaves
 sanuj	HeikoS, i didn't try that
 sanuj	yes
@HeikoS	so you could send a PR where you replace a few SG_ADDs
@HeikoS	like different categories of SG_ADD we have
 sanuj	i see
@HeikoS	the model selection framework is another issue
 sanuj	because we need to start the conversion
@HeikoS	why you cannot just remove the old thing
@HeikoS	yes definitely
@HeikoS	what about you try to hack SG_ADD a bit=?
 sanuj	haha
 sanuj	we can have SG_ADD
@HeikoS	or just add a few register_params
 sanuj	and register_param separately
@HeikoS	under the corresponding SG_AFF
@HeikoS	ADD
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	yeah that is a good way to start testing it
 sanuj	that would be easy to test if things work
@HeikoS	BUT
@HeikoS	you want to change SG_ADD to do that
@HeikoS	eventually
 sanuj	HeikoS, but at the end if we only have register_param then it doesn't make sense to use SG_ADD
@HeikoS	sanuj: SG_ADD can just be a wrapper for that
 sanuj	it would be an alias
@HeikoS	yes
 sanuj	but why do we need an alias
@HeikoS	this way we dont need to touch all these files
 sanuj	ohkay
@HeikoS	because we are lazy
 sanuj	i see
 sanuj	haha
@HeikoS	because we want to get our effects with minimal changes
@HeikoS	every file you change opens some possibility for doing it wrong
 sanuj	yeah
@HeikoS	so I rather just touch one file
@HeikoS	i.e. changing SG_ADD
@HeikoS	in one place, and then all classes use tags
 sanuj	lisitsyn was saying it might be tricky to hack SG_ADD
 sanuj	will have to see for myself

@HeikoS	sanuj: choose any
@HeikoS	do one add per category type
@HeikoS	that is: one for scalar
@HeikoS	float, int
@HeikoS	one for vector
@HeikoS	one for matrix
@HeikoS	etc
@HeikoS	and then we see what travis says
@HeikoS	sanuj: btw what about the plugin pr?
@HeikoS	where did that code come from?
 sanuj	ohky
 sanuj	HeikoS, from aer
@HeikoS	I see
 sanuj	it needs some modifications though
 sanuj	will update it
 sanuj	HeikoS, for plugins
@HeikoS	okok
 sanuj	users will use createX()
@HeikoS	I see
 sanuj	not sure how to implement it
@HeikoS	sanuj: I hope we can push this to some nice point during GSoC still
@HeikoS	but it will definitely needs some love even after
@HeikoS	hope youre up for that :D
 sanuj	yeah i know
 sanuj	yes i'm up for that
 sanuj	:D
 sanuj	HeikoS, i'll make a dir in shogun root called plugin
 sanuj	new plugins will be added in that dir
 sanuj	and cmake will just build every dir in the plugins dir into a plugin.so
@HeikoS	sanuj: is that discussed with sergey?
@HeikoS	I think we also said something like every class will be a plugin?
@HeikoS	or are plugins defined via an "include" list of classes
@HeikoS	?
