@sonney2k	wiking, then only disable them for osx
@sonney2k	wiking, or anything !linux
@sonney2k	the integration tests we have cover much more than the few tiny tests we currently have so they are invaluable and turning them of completely is no option

@lisitsyn	sonne|work: welcome back hehe
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: hey hey
 sonne|work	man what a neural network overoverhype!
 sonne|work	I felt like in the early days of kernel machines!
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: haha because they work
@lisitsyn	for images
 sonne|work	they work under very specific conditions
 sonne|work	with lots and lots of data
 sonne|work	and lots and lots of computing power
 sonne|work	and they are one of the few methods that drastically benefit from GPUs
 sonne|work	so I guess that is why
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes they work nice on gpus
 sonne|work	but as usual no free lunch :D
@lisitsyn	of course
@lisitsyn	but it appears to be better than older stuff
@lisitsyn	for some tasks
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: may be you want to visit samara in september? :)
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: no it is the older stuff
 sonne|work	it is the same stuff from the 80's or so but done with more data & computing power
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: true
 sonne|work	and they still have local minima and need clever data normalization
 sonne|work	suitable number of hidden layers
 sonne|work	structure etc
 sonne|work	I would say it didn't get easier but hey I guess one can say that about any method
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: so no more svms? :)
 sonne|work	I saw cascades of decision / regression trees
 sonne|work	and the usual stuff like logistic regression etc
 sonne|work	and NN's
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn: oh nice a conference in your city :)

 sonne|work	ok so I wait 30mins
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	i dont think so
@wiking	it should be already there
@wiking	or?
@wiking	sent it to Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@wiking	sonne|work: it's all about the intergration tests...
@wiking	and that we should basically disable it temporarily
@wiking	or at least return always 0
@wiking	so that it does not fail even if some of it fails :P
 sonne|work	wiking: greylisting
@wiking	sonne|work: oh motherfucker
@wiking	:)
@wiking	sonne|work: evne from gmail? :)
@wiking	sonne|work: *eve
@wiking	*even
@wiking	sonne|work: u shoudl have it in /msg :P
@wiking	unless your irc client put me on flood :P
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah but I already said - why disable it?
 sonne|work	it is very valuable for linux
 sonne|work	if you want to disable it then just for !linux systems
 sonne|work	Admittedly I don't feel very comfortable of having our own rng in shogun
 sonne|work	it is a cruzial thing - does eigen ship one btw?
@wiking	ok but they are destined to fail of !linux
@wiking	*on !linux
@wiking	either we same the models for other OS as well in data repo
@wiking	or what u suggest is that we don't run them on non-linux systems
@wiking	but then in my opinion is a badly designed test :(
@wiking	it's kind of like kill it's purpose :P
@wiking	if the test can only be run on a given system....
-!- shogun-notifier- [~irker@7nn.de] has quit [Quit: transmission timeout]
 sonne|work	wiking: I didn't say we cannot fix it
 sonne|work	but I am against disabling it
 sonne|work	these integration tests are much more helpful then our few unit tests
 sonne|work	and it takes long ages to get the whole suite back to work if we ignore them for 6 months (==this gsoc)
@wiking	ok but imo we should do something about it, becuase now one really has to check the travis builds in detail to see whether a PR or a commit does indeed break the shogun build, instead of really just checking a small icon which is either red or green...;P
 sonne|work	wiking: wait why?
 sonne|work	everything should work now right?!
@wiking	sonne|work: no now it fails
@wiking	sonne|work: everything
 sonne|work	wiking: why?
@wiking	sonne|work: check out this for example
@wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1018
@wiking	according to travis this PR is not good... it fails the build
@wiking	but it's not because of that given PR
 sonne|work	serialization_complex_example.py setting 1/2
@wiking	it's because the python_modular integration tests fails
 sonne|work	only that fails
 sonne|work	nothing more
@wiking	sonne|work: indeed
@wiking	sonne|work: but still you don't know this
 sonne|work	so we just have to fix that
@wiking	unless you check yourself
@wiking	the travis builds
 sonne|work	err?
@wiking	well on github you only know that the travis build failed
 sonne|work	when something breaks you have to check the stuff and fix it
 sonne|work	yes sure
@wiking	yes but now it's always broken
 sonne|work	but how else would you do it?
@wiking	no matter what u do
 sonne|work	wiking: well then just fix the example / the bug
 sonne|work	"just"
@wiking	sonne|work: ok... let me put it another way
@wiking	i myself have no possible means to find out why that one little integration test fails on travis
@wiking	and this is like this for the last 1-2 weeks
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah me neither
@wiking	hence nobody has any time/motivation etc
 sonne|work	because it works here
@wiking	to fix this
 sonne|work	so I just don't know how to fix it
@wiking	and i suggested a way to overcome this problem
@wiking	'just'
 sonne|work	how?
 sonne|work	we could just blacklist this particular test
 sonne|work	(like we do with lots of the others already)
@wiking	sonne|work: either remove the integration test, or just don't return 1 if one of the the integration tests fails
 sonne|work	we have to fail
 sonne|work	otherwise no one will check test
 sonne|work	s
 sonne|work	then better blacklist it
@wiking	ok then let's blacklist that one serialization test
 sonne|work	wiking: just open up generator.py
 sonne|work	and add the test to the blacklist
@wiking	sonne|work: btw it's really funny enough that *that* given test does not fail on osx...
 sonne|work	it will kill both cases though
@wiking	sonne|work: but a lot of others does....
 sonne|work	I don't understand how it can fail
 sonne|work	I mean it works for one and not for the other
 sonne|work	maybe we should not blacklist but print the differences
@wiking	well that's an option as well
@wiking	sonne|work: http://pastebin.com/pquRSArj
@wiking	or you have a more sophisticated one?
 sonne|work	wiking: maybe better add a failed_string
 sonne|work	then add a tuple to failed
 sonne|work	failed.append((setting_str, failed_str))
 sonne|work	so that we see it as summary at the end
 sonne|work	otherwise it gets lots
 sonne|work	but otherwise yes - that is whay I would do
@wiking	and failed_str is the 2 tuples?
 sonne|work	and also mention if the length doesn't fit etc
 sonne|work	wiking: there is a failed=[] array at the top
@wiking	yes
 sonne|work	failed_str should be some string in the end
@wiking	and i see that setting_str is appeneded
 sonne|work	it probably should also list if len(a) != len(b) etc
 sonne|work	but hey it is a start

@wiking	http://code.google.com/p/librf/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Flibrf
@wiking	and add a wrapper around it
@wiking	for shogun?
 lisitsyn	looks like it is not free
@wiking	where?
@wiking	even weka is using this
 lisitsyn	I mean it is just non-commercial
@wiking	http://code.google.com/p/librf/source/browse/trunk/COPYING
 lisitsyn	ah alright
 lisitsyn	if it s gpl then ye
@wiking	lisitsyn: ah u r checking the other
@wiking	lisitsyn: ok question lib/external/librf
@wiking	or lib/librf?
 lisitsyn	wiking: external probably
@wiking	ok let's add a new branch finally to git
@wiking	feature/RandomForest
@wiking	:)
@wiking	huh this import will be rather funny

 gsomix	sonne|work: sonney2k: lisitsyn: iglesiasg: HeikoS: wiking: good evening. can you take a look at it? http://pastebin.com/XMW7NyrP :)
 gsomix	I'm opened for any suggestions
@iglesiasg	it doesn't seem to load here :S
@HeikoS	same here :)
 gsomix	oh gosh :(
 gsomix	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19029407/ideas%20for%20gsoc%202013.txt
@HeikoS	gsomix: like all the ideas!
@iglesiasg	gsomix: yeah, nice ones
@HeikoS	especially R and matlab bindings :) but they might be challenging
@iglesiasg	gsomix: my favourite are the 4th and the 6th
 gsomix	iglesiasg: thanks
 gsomix	HeikoS: yep, most challenging task is matlab interface, because swig doesn't have officially support (only for octave)
@iglesiasg	gsomix: and one more suggesting that I would love seeing is cmake support
@iglesiasg	suggesting -> suggestion
@HeikoS	gsomix: did you have a look at that project by the guy who wanted to improve swig for matlab?
@HeikoS	gsomix: but this might be quite hard in fact
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: gsomix: IMHO matlab interface doesn't pay off the effort
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: I know you are a matlab supporter though :)
@HeikoS	iglesiasg: I think I recently changed the sides :)
@HeikoS	but still, we need to have it
@HeikoS	so many people use it
 gsomix	HeikoS: a little, just looked at code. not have time for test right now. I plan to test it after proposal submiting.
@HeikoS	ok
 gsomix	HeikoS: so, we can lay aside this idea for near future.
@HeikoS	I would be very keen in having automatic interfaces for matlab
@HeikoS	almost everyone I know uses it
@HeikoS	I tell them to use python, but it doesnt help :)
 gsomix	iglesiasg: cmake support. added to list
@HeikoS	same for R btw
@HeikoS	both bio and stats people mostly use R
@iglesiasg	gsomix: it would be pretty awesome, but it can be tought. I am not sure
@HeikoS	(and matlab)
 gsomix	HeikoS: yep, I use matlab for my research, and my supervisor, and all in my lab. it is very popular.
@HeikoS	exactly

 Vikalp	Hi everybody
 Vikalp	M getting linking error while using shogun sgmatrix
 Vikalp	Can anybody please help me out?
@lisitsyn	Vikalp: hey
@lisitsyn	are you using -lshogun key?
 Vikalp	Yes
@lisitsyn	what is the error?
@wiking	ok
@wiking	why is this:
@wiking	-LINKFLAGS_PYTHON="-ldl -lutil"
@wiking	-POSTLINKFLAGS_PYTHON="-ldl -lutil"
@wiking	in ./configure
@lisitsyn	wiking: they should not be here?
@wiking	lisitsyn: well it's fine as long as it's only intended for linux ;)
@lisitsyn	wiking: ahh
@wiking	there's no libdl on *bsd
@lisitsyn	wiking: I should buy a mac
@lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	lisitsyn: any idea how i can move the feature/RandomForest branch to shogun-toolbox/shogun repo?
@lisitsyn	wiking: I actually had a chance but bought that shitty samsung
@wiking	https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/tree/feature/RandomForest
@wiking	the gitflow feature publish put it to my own repo
@wiking	:S
@lisitsyn	wiking: but why do you want to have it in main repo
@wiking	lisitsyn: so that you can contribute as well?
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah makes sense
@lisitsyn	wiking: okay gitflow just names branches
@wiking	i mean in any feature if you publish it
@lisitsyn	so git pull it
@wiking	it would be great to go to the upstream repo
@wiking	since u want to publish it
@lisitsyn	wiking: just pull and push it
@wiking	in order that others can contribute as well
@wiking	you mean git push upstream feature/RandomForest
@wiking	?
@wiking	there :)

@wiking	yey
@wiking	ok this one compiles fine
@wiking	we need wrappers and unit tests
@wiking	the original code does have unit tests
@wiking	so i'll integrate them
@wiking	hah
@wiking	instance_set_unittest.cc
@wiking	;)
@wiking	yey
@wiking	only thing that it's not written using gtest :P
@wiking	but of course i don't know if it's a good idea to add unit tests that are testing none-shogun code... but i guess it wouldn't hurt
@lisitsyn	wiking: we should have some strict policy

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Also added a basic unit test for it, that embeds the test data from 3D to 2D using implemented wrapper, and checks that resulting data is actually in 2D, and that number of features stay the same.

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: this is very cool stuff
@HeikoS	oh and btw
@HeikoS	a stats postdoc here will implement a simple mala sampler in shogun
@HeikoS	and with that hopefully create the foundation for some sampling action
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: what is it?
@HeikoS	Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm
@HeikoS	https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&ved=0CEgQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ece.duke.edu%2F~lcarin%2FGirolami2011.pdf&ei=_oN5UaPJJueG0AWps4CYBA&usg=AFQjCNGJbqNdUQI9I7lO9fmhlASnVkzQmw&sig2=iBwA1_GfIGupW4ICewOiGQ&bvm=bv.45645796,d.d2k
@lisitsyn	no idea!
@lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	a method to sample probability distributions that are complicated
@HeikoS	you can use that to solve integrals that are too hard otherwise
@HeikoS	think of it as brute force breaking things when you cannot do anything elegant ;)
@HeikoS	but in an elegant way :D
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: sounds like monte-carlo

@HeikoS	next year's gsoc will have a sampling project for sure! :)
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: for example we could add a script
@lisitsyn	that creates a class
@lisitsyn	puts it to modular interface
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: see what I mean?
@HeikoS	?
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean for your guy it is not obvious how to put a class to modular interface
