 BRIAN	HI
@sonney2k	hi
-!- BRIAN is now known as Guest59634
 Guest59634	STRANGE, MY NAEM CHANGED
 Guest59634	sorry about the caps
 Guest59634	I'm having an issue with shogun 1.0.0
 Guest59634	AttributeError: classify
@sonney2k	use apply()
 Guest59634	Oh has this changed between versions?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	from 0.10.x -> 1.0.0 we did a number of intrusive changes
 Guest59634	ah
 Guest59634	is apply identical to classify?
@sonney2k	yes
 Guest59634	is PerformanceMeasures still around?
@sonney2k	yes - new names - look at the example
@sonney2k	much improved
 Guest59634	ah
@sonney2k	all in evaluation now
 Guest59634	ah
 Guest59634	ah
 Guest59634	Thanks for helping
@sonney2k	np
 Guest59634	the code im working on must have used a very old version of shogun
@sonney2k	well 1.0 just came out end of august
@sonney2k	so ...
 Guest59634	oh these changes were all from 1.0?
@sonney2k	yes
 Guest59634	anything new on the horizon for shogun?
@sonney2k	for 1.0 you mean?
 Guest59634	beyond that
 Guest59634	new models?
@sonney2k	for 1.0 read my blog post http://sonnenburgs.de/soeren/category/blog/
@sonney2k	beyond that - no concrete plans - all contributions are welcome
@sonney2k	I will rework things internally - and new methods will gradually appear (as usual) but not really with a 'we need method XXX roadmap'
 Guest59634	ah
@sonney2k	I personally implmeent methods when I need them
 Guest59634	oh, im still a little new to python
