 sonne|work	pluskid: what is the lasso parameter doing in CLARS?
 pluskid	sonne|work: you mean the regularization coefficient?
 sonne|work	the parameter in the constructor
 sonne|work	it can be true or false
 pluskid	\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 pluskid	oops, cat on keyboard
 pluskid	when it is true, it runs the LASSO
 pluskid	when false, it runs LARS
 pluskid	the LARS algorithm has a modification, which could give us a LASSO solution
 pluskid	when passed true in the constructor, this modification is turned on
 pluskid	I think the most case we use LARS is to get the LASSO solution (instead of the original LARS), so I made that parameter default to true
 pluskid	sonne|work: am I clear?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	that was just missing from the doc
 CIA-64	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r879ba9e / src/shogun/regression/LARS.h : fix doxygen warning in lars - http://git.io/-3TFeQ
 sonne|work	however I still don't know what the difference between LASSO / LARS is
 pluskid	sonne|work: thanks for the fix of doxygen
 pluskid	in my understanding, LARS is a stagewise variable selection algorithm
 pluskid	LASSO in its general meaning corresponds the the linear regression with L1-regularization
 pluskid	the original LARS algorithm doesn't corresponds to any objective function though
 pluskid	but when the *lasso modification* is enabled in the LARS algorithm, it will provide the solution for the LASSO problem
 pluskid	when referring LASSO, we generally mean the problem
 pluskid	and there are many different algorithms for solving LASSO
 pluskid	sonne|work: that's my understanding, if you have interest, you may refer to the paper for more details :) www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/LeastAngle_2002.pdf

 sonne|work	pluskid: ok I will have to read that
 sonne|work	pluskid: I understand the problem with multiclass/kernel machine
 sonne|work	one cannot set a multiclass machine as constraint generator
 sonne|work	there is a separate multiclass mkl for that
 sonne|work	so you should be fine
 pluskid	sonne|work: that's nice, so we would be safe to simply remove the (currently) commented out code in GUIClassifier
 uricamic	hi there
 uricamic	I have some problems with git push
 uricamic	I have committed changes to my branch, followed instructions from http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2537 and when I try to git push origin my_branch it results in this error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:uricamic/shogun.git'
 pluskid	uricamic: what is the detailed output of git?
 uricamic	pluskid: you mean after that push?
 uricamic	To git@github.com:uricamic/shogun.git  ! [rejected]        GSKRR -> GSKRR (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:uricamic/shogun.git' To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
 pluskid	uricamic: it seems you have rebased your local branch, isn't it?
 pluskid	one simple solution is to first delete your remote branch, and then push again
 pluskid	something like
 pluskid	git push origin :branch-name
 pluskid	and then
 uricamic	pluskid: yes, I have followed this link: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.ai.machine-learning.shogun/2537
 pluskid	git push origin branch-name
 uricamic	delete my remote branch?
 pluskid	yes, try the command I mentioned above
 uricamic	how can I delete my remote branch?
 pluskid	git push origin :branch-name
 pluskid	note the colon (:) before the branch name
 uricamic	ok, I will try this
 uricamic	pluskid: thanks, it seems that this worked
 pluskid	although it seems you can also solve this problem by using git pull, but that will introduce an empty commit for merging, so I think the method here is more cleaner
 shogun-buildbot	build #477 of ruby_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/ruby_modular/builds/477
 pluskid	uricamic: then you should be able to push your branch to origin now :)
-!- n4nd0 [~nando@s83-179-44-135.cust.tele2.se] has joined #shogun
 uricamic	pluskid: ok, I think the pushed worked, but now when I have already some opened pull request for this, should I close it and do a pull request again?
 uricamic	*push
 pluskid	uricamic: you have to create multiple branches to make multiple pull request
 pluskid	I think the pull request are to be closed by the maintainers when they merged your commits to the official shogon repo
 pluskid	*shogun
 uricamic	pluskid: yes, I already know this :) the question is, if I have to do the pull request again, or if the changes which I have pushed right now will appear in the original pull request
 pluskid	uricamic: OK, I see, as long as the branch name does not change, your new commits will be automatically "merged" into the pull request
 pluskid	uricamic: you can look at the pull request you originally opened, navigate to "commits" tab, and see your new commits there
 uricamic	pluskid: ok, thanks again :)
 pluskid	uricamic: u r wel~ :)
 n4nd0	hey guys
 n4nd0	so now you were talking about the topic
 n4nd0	if a pull request is already opened
 n4nd0	is there any danger to rebase with the changes added to remote master since that pull request was opened?
 pluskid	n4nd0: I don't think so
 pluskid	actually, rebasing is always encouraged , I think
 n4nd0	ok, so I can just go to my master
 n4nd0	rebase upstream/master
 n4nd0	push origin master
 n4nd0	go to my branch
 n4nd0	rebase master
 n4nd0	and later commit and push the new changes to the branch to update the pull request
 pluskid	what github do is simply keeping a reference to the branch name you are using for that pull request
 n4nd0	aham
 pluskid	when your branch changes (i.e. new commits are added), the pull request updates automatically
 n4nd0	but I am afraid that the changes that enter in my branch when doing rebasing
 n4nd0	the ones that are not mine
 n4nd0	are introduced in the pull request as mine
 pluskid	rebasing is inserting changes *before* your branch commits
 pluskid	so when you run git rebase master
 n4nd0	yeah
 pluskid	it takes those commits in master that happens *after* you create the branch,
 n4nd0	but now we are talking about changes that happened *after* the first changes in that pull request
 pluskid	yes
 pluskid	those commits are inserted *before* the first commit in your branch
 n4nd0	that makes sense
 n4nd0	:)
 pluskid	however, we do have problem pushing to remote branch when we do rebasing
 pluskid	if we have already pushed parts of our branch to origin
 pluskid	we get non-fast-forward error
 pluskid	you have encountered this error before, IIRC :)
 pluskid	you solved it with git pull
 pluskid	which produce an empty commit of merging
 pluskid	My solution is to delete the remote branch first and push again
 pluskid	which would be cleaner in my view
 n4nd0	yeah, I think I had an error related to this before
 n4nd0	but I think it was because I didn't push to origin master after rebasing
 pluskid	oh, maybe
 n4nd0	I will try it soon and let you know
 n4nd0	I agree, to delete the remote branch looks cleaner

 Marina	I made poims with poim.py half a year before and now it doesn't  work anymore....
 n4nd0	Marina: all right
 n4nd0	Marina: so where is this poim.py?
 Marty28	It is in the easysvm package. It uses shogun-content.
 n4nd0	ok found it
 n4nd0	applications/easysvm/esvm/poim.py
 Marina	can I send it to you per email?
 Marina	a yes that's it
 n4nd0	Marina: ok, so can you tell me exactly how to reproduce the error?
* n4nd0 is afk
* n4nd0 is back
 n4nd0	wiking: around?
 Marty28	My code here:
 Marty28	    print "Loading kernel"
 Marty28	    k1 = rdata.dataio.load_kernel(basename + ".kernel.dat",True)
 Marty28	    print "Loading SVM"
 Marty28	    svm1 = rdata.dataio.loadbz2(basename + ".svm.bz2")
 Marty28	    # POIM stuff
 Marty28	    print "Computing POIMs"
 Marty28	    from poim import compute_poims
 Marty28	    poimdegree = 5
 Marty28	    max_len = 2
 Marty28	    #
 Marty28	    print "Trying to POIM..."
 Marty28	    poim, max_poim, diff_poim, poim_totalmass = compute_poims(svm1, k1, poimdegree, max_len)
* Marty28 tries to remember IRC...
 wiking	?
 wiking	n4nd0: sup?
 n4nd0	wiking: git support ... as usual :P
 wiking	lol
 n4nd0	wiking: I don't know if you read my conv with pluskid before, it is about that
 n4nd0	wiking: I can make a summary otherwise
 wiking	sorry was away :(
 n4nd0	wiking: ok so I openend a pull request
 n4nd0	didn't work on it for a couple of days
 n4nd0	now I am back
 n4nd0	I rebased my origin master with upstream master, push to origin master
 n4nd0	back in my branch where I do the work
 n4nd0	I do some commits
 n4nd0	rebase master
 n4nd0	and when I try to push, the usual error
 n4nd0	git push origin jlcovertree
 n4nd0	To git@github.com:iglesias/shogun.git ! [rejected]        jlcovertree -> jlcovertree (non-fast-forward)
 n4nd0	error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:iglesias/shogun.git'
 Marina	and if you use exactly the code from https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/applications/easysvm/esvm/poim.py you get the error:  TypeError: WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel_prepare_POIM2() takes exactly 4 arguments (2 given)
 n4nd0	To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
 n4nd0	Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
 n4nd0	'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
 Marty28	compute_poims does     distr = ones((max_len,4))/4 ;
 Marty28	then kernel.prepare_POIM2(distr, poimdegree, max_len)
 wiking	n4nd0: and after doing a git pull?
 n4nd0	wiking: I didn't pull yet because as far as I remember
 n4nd0	wiking: last time I did that
 Marty28	The error is only about the distr (numpy.ones generated it)
 n4nd0	wiking: and my commits entered twice in the branch
 Marina	So I have write kernel.prepare_POIM2(distr) to kernel.prepare_POIM2(distr, poimdegree, max_len) like you
 Marina	and than I get the same error
 wiking	n4nd0: mmm that's interesting
 Marina	 TypeError: in method 'WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel_prepare_POIM2', argument 2 of type 'float64_t *'
 Marty28	The error is only about the type of dist.
 wiking	afaik a git pull would try to do a merge basically
 n4nd0	wiking: I will pull and push and see what happens
 wiking	pull will do you a merge thing
 wiking	or at least will try
 n4nd0	wiking: in any case, pluskid suggested to delete the remote branch doing git push :branch
 wiking	since what it'll try to do
 wiking	is to sync your remote repo with your local changes
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	that's another option of course
 n4nd0	wiking: if I remove the remote branch, the pull request will disappear as well or not?
 wiking	it's more brute force solution
 wiking	but it'll solve your thing
 wiking	yes
 wiking	itshould
 Marty28	So probably either WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel.prepare_POIM2 was changed or numpy.ones (improbable)
 wiking	since that commit only exist in that branch
 wiking	afaik
 wiking	but i'm not 100% sure of github internals
 wiking	so maybe they do save somewhere the pull requested commits
 wiking	i wouldn't do but who knows
 Marina	Marty28: yes I think so too
 wiking	maybe for some caching purposes or something they'd do it
 n4nd0	Marina, Marty28: mm I can execute poim.py without problems, maybe I am trying exactly what fails for you
 n4nd0	maybe I am not, sorry
 n4nd0	wiking: I am going to pull and push
 Marty28	numpy.ones gives <type 'numpy.ndarray'>
 n4nd0	wiking: hopefully the commits won't be duplicated
 wiking	hehehe
 Marty28	prepare_POIM2 needs float64_t *
 wiking	well that happens when rebase/merge fails
 wiking	but it's not a real duplication...
 n4nd0	wiking: git pull origin branch right?
 wiking	yep the remote branch...
 n4nd0	wiking: mmm, I got some conflicts :(
 wiking	so the merge was not possible
 wiking	i mean automatically
 wiking	what are you conflict files?
 Marty28	n4nd0: Of what type is your "dist" (1st parameter of prepare_POIM2)?
 n4nd0	wiking: is there a way to indicate to accept my local version?
 wiking	n4nd0: you'll have to fix it by yourself by hand
 n4nd0	wiking: all right
 wiking	n4nd0: check the git status
 wiking	and you'll see the conflicted files
 wiking	there go in edit them as you please
 wiking	and then do a git commit -a
 wiking	thus you'll have the merge done
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	Marty28: I am taking a closer look to poim.py
 n4nd0	Marty28: I can just see method definitions there
 Marty28	    print "TYPE(distr): " + str(type(distr)) gives <type 'numpy.ndarray'> for me
 Marina	yes right
 Marty28	prepare_POIM2 needs 'float64_t *'
 n4nd0	Marty28: yeah but what do you want me to execute?
 n4nd0	Marty28: I mean, there must be another script making use of the functions in poim.py
 n4nd0	Marty28: is it what you pasted above?
 Marina	but if I make print distr.dtype than the answer is  float64
 Marty28	Our own?
 Marina	no I've found it on http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial
 Marty28	n4nd0: poim.compute_poims is used
 n4nd0	Marty28: from where?
 Marty28	From my script
 Marty28	n4nd0: poim, max_poim, diff_poim, poim_totalmass = compute_poims(svm1, k1, poimdegree, max_len)
 n4nd0	Marty28: yeah but ... how I can execute your script?
 Marty28	Of course the script needs an svm and a kernel.
 n4nd0	Marty28: so do you have all the code for me to reproduce the error in one file or in several files?
 Marty28	I would have to prepare that, mom
 n4nd0	http://snipt.org
 n4nd0	you can paste your code there if so
 n4nd0	wiking: :O it went pretty bad
 n4nd0	wiking: I pull, solved the conflict
 n4nd0	wiking: commit the merge
 n4nd0	wiking: push all the changes and look
 n4nd0	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/455/commits
 n4nd0	in my pull request the commits appear twice and I have even got commits not done by me
 wiking	ihhhh
 wiking	:(
 sonne|work	n4nd0: you forgot a rebase
 n4nd0	sonne|work: really? in my branch or where?
 sonne|work	n4nd0: at some point you did a git pull
 sonne|work	and then a git push
 n4nd0	summary of what I did
 sonne|work	which will make all the commits you did before the pull not to appear on top
 sonne|work	but before that
 sonne|work	so things look cluttered
 n4nd0	the pull request was opened from the other day
 n4nd0	git checkout master
 n4nd0	git fetch upstream
 n4nd0	git rebase upstream/master
 n4nd0	git push origin master
 n4nd0	git checkout <my branch>
 n4nd0	git rebase master
 n4nd0	some new commits
 n4nd0	I couldn't push for the error ^
 n4nd0	git pull
 n4nd0	fix conflicts
 n4nd0	git commit (commit for the merge)
 n4nd0	git push origin <my branch>
 n4nd0	what should I have done?
 sonne|work	the last git pull should have been a git pull --rebase
 n4nd0	it was git pull origin <my branch>
 n4nd0	I should have done then git pull --rebase origin < my branch >
 n4nd0	??
 wiking	mmm we don't have a structural solver out of box right? :)
 sonne|work	wiking, after the end of gsoc
 wiking	hehehe who's doing it?
 sonne|work	we will see :)
 wiking	ah ok shit yeah
 wiking	no decision yet
 wiking	:)))
 wiking	anyhow i'll put one now in
 wiking	some hackstuff based on libqp
 sonne|work	n4nd0: I don't know how you work but I ususally keep master in sync with origin/master
 Marty28	ok
 sonne|work	n4nd0: so I would have done git checkout master; git pull --rebase ; git checkout <my branch> ; git rebase master ; ...
 n4nd0	how would you have solved my situation then?
 n4nd0	there was a branch
-!- rico [2e1fd566@gateway/web/freenode/ip.46.31.213.102] has joined #shogun
 n4nd0	with a pull request issued
 n4nd0	where I wanted to make new changes
 Marty28	http://snipt.org/uhggf0
 n4nd0	but also to bring in there the changes from master
 Marty28	kernel_weighted_degree_position_string_modular is from shogun examples
 Marty28	Data is shogun data
 rico	hi there
 n4nd0	Marty28: ok, let me try to make it work :)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: via git checkout master; git pull --rebase ; git checkout <my branch> ; git rebase master ; git push
 Marty28	Just a type error, it says.
 n4nd0	sonne|work: and after that start the new work
 n4nd0	sonne|work: maybe it was that, I should have pushed changes from master before commiting my own changes
 rico	I am working on action recognition using opencv (mostly in c++)
 rico	I am looking for code example which shows use of libshogun on opencv data structure.
 sonne|work	I don't understand - I thought the new work was already committed?
 rico	maybe a way to convert SGMatrix to opencv matrix ?
 Marty28	n4nd0: thanks :)
 sonne|work	rico: SGMatrix is just a ptr to some values, i.e. double*
 n4nd0	sonne|work: no, the new work was still to be done
 Marina	n4nd0: many thanks :)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: then branch off from master, do the new work and push
 n4nd0	sonne|work: mmm I think there's a missunderstanding here
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the branch already existed, I did some work, commit, ..., pull request and fine
 n4nd0	sonne|work: after a couple of days, I want to continue with my work in that branch
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but sync it with master too
 rico	 sonne|work: float64_t don't match with opencv's double, is there any issue already reported ?
 n4nd0	that branch had a pull request open
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@188.168.4.185] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	n4nd0: yes I understand that is why I am saying that you should do git checkout master; git pull --rebase ; git checkout <my branch> ; git rebase master  to be in sync again
 sonne|work	rico - it is just a double
 n4nd0	sonne|work: ok, for the moment I will delete the pull request since it has got quite dirty

 sonne|work	I should but don't have time currently
 n4nd0	sonne|work: it looks like it is a problem with the typemaps
 n4nd0	sonne|work: my guess is that to change the type of the argument to an SGVector should make it work

 blackburn	sonne|work: magic
 sonne|work	black or white?
 blackburn	sonne|work: just some fourier stuff
 blackburn	as in HIK and JS
 sonne|work	so gaussians become polynomials?
 blackburn	sonne|work: I am not sure what you mean
 blackburn	using bochner's theorem they obtain spectrum of kernel usually
 blackburn	so they just construct features from spectrum

 n4nd0	Marty28: I think that makes the program break a bit later
 Marty28	I just used some number, AFAIK.
 n4nd0	aham, all right
 n4nd0	it looks like it cannot be any number
 Marty28	use 1
 n4nd0	no
 n4nd0	I mean, it breaks too
 Marty28	    easysvm.py poim 10 6 wd 10 2 arff testmotif1.arff poims.png dna R
 Marty28	    easysvm.py poim 10 6 wd 10 2 fasta testmotifpos.fasta testmotifneg.fasta poims.png dna R
 n4nd0	ok
 Marty28	This is an application of POIM functionality.
 n4nd0	what you tell me the values then?
 n4nd0	for poimdegree and max_len
 n4nd0	10 and 6?
 Marty28	esvm/experiment.py
 Marty28	There svm_poim
 Marty28	so it is the 6 in the example
 Marty28	usage: %s poim C poimdegree wd [kernelparameters] [arff|fasta] inputfiles  poim.png [dna|protein] non(nucleotide|amino)converter
 n4nd0	what about max_len?
 Marty28	I guess it is about the motifs.
 Marty28	Maybe start with 5.
 n4nd0	6 for poimdegree and 5 for max_len fails
 Marty28	max_len 2?
 n4nd0	6 and 23 made it work
 n4nd0	ok
 Marty28	len(examples[0])
 n4nd0	yeah ...
 n4nd0	but examples was?
 n4nd0	anyway, that is solved now
 Marty28	hehe
 n4nd0	so now you script executes without problems
 Marty28	I guess 92, but I do not know exactly.
 Marty28	fine, thanks!
 n4nd0	blackburn: should we modify the whole class first?
 n4nd0	all the float64_t* to SG_Vector or SGMatrix?
 blackburn	n4nd0: yes float64_t* won't work at all
 n4nd0	blackburn: ok, I will do that and prepare a pull request so you can check it
 blackburn	n4nd0: I am worried they do some tricks there (like different real and efficient shapes of matrices)
 Marty28	(if you succeed please also think about WeightedDegreeStringKernel, which has similar functionality. s?ren ought to know.)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: that is legacy code - the remainders of the double* -> SGVector migration we started changing last gsoc
 n4nd0	sonne|work: yeah, it looks like that
 blackburn	legacy shit
 n4nd0	:D
 Marty28	sonne: So is there a more modern version for WD and POIMs? Or any string kernels which are even better for the purpose?

 Marty28	Still changing the data type of a simple 1d-array ought to be easy, I suppose
 tom__	Is there an implementation of substring kernels in libshogun ?
 n4nd0	Marty28: yeah, it is probably easy, I am a slow guy though :)
 Marty28	Learning curves are exponential :D
 blackburn	Marty28: you are always welcome to fix things by yourself :P
 Marty28	Just a computational biologist. I can invent new applications and promote your stuff, though :)
 tom__	Is there an implementation of substring kernels in libshogun ? Thanks.
 n4nd0	tom__: I don't really know if we have what you are looking for
 n4nd0	tom__: you can take a look here and check if any of these would serve you
 n4nd0	http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/dir_00ae96b5ce7201865cb2972b4a123693.html
 blackburn	or https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/master/src/shogun/kernel
 n4nd0	yeah, better try the second link, documentation may not be updated
 n4nd0	blackburn: thanks ;)
 sonne|work	n4nd0: actually no new string kernel for a few years now - I guess we have them all :D
 Marty28	:)
 tom__	sonne|work: n4nd0: thx, great works btw.
 Marina	I get the same float64 error if I used : maxlen = 23 and poimdegree = 6... whats my mistake?
 Marty28	Marina: I guess it only works for a new version he made.
 blackburn	Marina: the problem is in old typemaps we have abandoned
 blackburn	it was (float64_t*, int, int) or so
 blackburn	and now it should be SGMatrix
 blackburn	the only issue with it is a proper shapes handling
 n4nd0	Marty28, Marina: the thing is that not only the couple of changes that I made to make your script work are necessary to fix all the class
 n4nd0	and it will take some time to have it ready
 Marina	ah ok...
 Marina	but how coud I used the SGMatrix?
 blackburn	Marina: you don't have to it is just dev issue
 Marina	:-)
 Marty28	n4nd0: Ok. Yet I think it will be worth it, the functionality sounds interesting :)
 n4nd0	I have to go now
 n4nd0	I will continue to work on this later
 n4nd0	hopefully it will be ready soon

 pluskid	n4nd0, deleting the remote branch won't make your pull request disappear
 pluskid	as long as you push again the branch to remote
 pluskid	I have done this multiple times
 blackburn	hmm nice idea
 pluskid	n4nd0's solution: git pull and merge, will cause duplicated commits as he said
 pluskid	so this would be a better solution
 pluskid	if there's any wiki for shogun, I think we can write something about our git work flow
 blackburn	pluskid: README.developer?
 blackburn	there is some mentioning of git workflow
 blackburn	please add
 pluskid	ok
 blackburn	pluskid: btw if you want to update chinese doc - feel free :) however I bet you won't like it (I wouldn't)
 pluskid	coz you don't know Chinese :p
 pluskid	BTW: why are there English and Chinese doc in the homepage?
 pluskid	I mean, no other languages?
 blackburn	pluskid: soeren wanted me to do russian but I was lazy and didn't
 pluskid	haha
 blackburn	but actually does it make sense?

 pluskid	hmm, English is almost universal
 pluskid	I'm just curious to see only Chinese there :p
 blackburn	it is obvious that machine learners can read and write in english
 pluskid	yes, that's almost true
 pluskid	and some can read english but might prefer other (native) language when available
 blackburn	it is a nightmare to support
 pluskid	but sync is a headache, when one has multiple translation
 pluskid	yes
 pluskid	I agree with you on this point
 blackburn	once some X language speaker leaves
 Marina	can I use an older shogun version to make poims work now?
 blackburn	you have nothing to do with that translation
 blackburn	Marina: what stops you?

 blackburn	no most important is 23, April
 pluskid	:)
 blackburn	pluskid: I guess it would be kind of morning for you when gsocers are announced?
 pluskid	not sure about the exact time
 blackburn	21 UTC afaik
 pluskid	not good at counting numbers :p, but most of the time when friends in the US send me emails, I got them in the morning
 blackburn	hard to believeheh
 pluskid	21 + 8 % 24 = 5, seems so
 pluskid	early in the morning if I'm not counting wrong :p

@sonney2k	blackburn, did anyone merge a fix?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, fix is not ready yet
 blackburn	Marina: what do you mean saying still?
 pluskid	blackburn, I'll try to be there, if necessary :)
@sonney2k	then I don't understand
@sonney2k	why try again if there is no fix yet?
 blackburn	sonney2k: no idea
 blackburn	sonney2k: please let n4ndo know about shapes of matrices there if would you have time
 Marina	ignore still ... I get the error and don't know what to do
 blackburn	non-trivial sometimes
 blackburn	Marina: do you want all the fixes get merged in a minute? :)
 Marina	:) sometimes
@sonney2k	hah!
 blackburn	Marina: I am not able to fix things now so you have to wait a little this time

 pluskid	updated README.developer for some notes on git
 pluskid	and opened a new pull request
 pluskid	btw, n4nd0, have you got our previous conversation just now? you can safely delete your remote branch without affecting your pull request
 n4nd0	oh yes pluskid I just read it in the logs :)
 n4nd0	it is a good plan then
 n4nd0	so I just have to delete the branch and it later push again?
 pluskid	I think better delete *the moment* before you would push again
 pluskid	not sure what github will show when someone go and look at the pull request, and find there's no such branch :p
 pluskid	however, there's a "force" option for pushing, which could ignore the non-fast-forward error, but I haven't tried this
-!- harshit_ [~harshit@182.68.246.67] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 n4nd0	wiking suggested me once not to force the push
 pluskid	yes, that's sounds horrible
 pluskid	I'd rather not try
 pluskid	though I guess the underlying thing is the same as deleting and pushing again

-!- pluskid [~pluskid@173.254.214.60] has joined #shogun
 pluskid	n4nd0, so you have merged locally?
 pluskid	that means those duplicated commits exists in your local branch
 n4nd0	pluskid: I think so, since I couldn't push, I did git pull and solved conflicts
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	I have a suggestion
 pluskid	you might create a new branch
 n4nd0	and move the files there right?
 pluskid	and make your changes of the current branch w.r.t. master as a patch
 pluskid	and apply the patch in the new branch
 pluskid	push the new branch to origin
 pluskid	update your pull request (you can edit the commit range, where you can change the branch name)
 pluskid	the pro is that you can avoid those duplicated commits
 pluskid	the cons is that you "lose" your individual commits, and merge them into one big commit
 pluskid	I think there's a command git-format-patch
 pluskid	for convenient making patches
 n4nd0	mmm
 n4nd0	so I should create the new branch
 n4nd0	and move there the files that I have been working on
 n4nd0	?
 pluskid	hmm
 pluskid	first goto the master branch
 pluskid	then create a new branch (based on master)
 n4nd0	ok
 pluskid	then goto jlcovertree branch
 pluskid	run git diff master > something.patch
 pluskid	and then goto the new branch
 pluskid	apply the patch
 n4nd0	oh
 n4nd0	I didn't know about this patches
 n4nd0	can I apply the changes directly?
 pluskid	yes, I guess so
 pluskid	something like
 pluskid	patch -p0 < the_path_file, IIRC
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	I will try it
 pluskid	try it, your work will be safe in the jlcovertree branch as long as you don't delete it
 n4nd0	I need a rest but I will try it later
 n4nd0	pluskid: thank you!
 pluskid	btw, I'm looking at the doc of git-format-patch
 pluskid	which might give you a better solution
 pluskid	which retains your individual commits

@sonney2k	blackburn, I am looking at his MC stuff now
@sonney2k	blackburn, this patch is huuuuge!
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes exactly
@sonney2k	blackburn, problem is (as he pointed out) that we have to paths
@sonney2k	one machine -> kernelmachine -> svm
@sonney2k	the other: machine -> multiclassmachine -> mulitclasskernelmachine -> multiclasssvm
@sonney2k	so a multiclass svm cannot be an svm any longer
 blackburn	sonney2k: I prefer second
@sonney2k	eh?
@sonney2k	we have both!
@sonney2k	it is only that multiclasssvm can no longer be an svm
@sonney2k	and this breaks a couple of things
 blackburn	sonney2k: there are a couple of reasons why multiclasssvm is not an svm
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah I am ok with that
 blackburn	sonney2k: C1/C2 and a lot of other things
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but for multiclass svm he now basically needs to add all the svm relvant functions
@sonney2k	like C
 blackburn	yes we have to..
@sonney2k	epsilon
@sonney2k	etc
@sonney2k	it is what he did
 blackburn	yes I know
@sonney2k	I don't understand why he made multiclassvm a friend of svm though?
@sonney2k	do you?
 blackburn	hmm let me check
