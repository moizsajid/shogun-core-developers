 sploving	sonney2k, around?
 sploving	anyone?
 sploving	it still can not work. :(

 sploving	thx sonney2k, all my work dir is in root dir. It is not easy for me to move it to another user
@sonney2k	sploving, look at my email
@sonney2k	it works here
@sonney2k	gtg
 sploving	I saw. maybe my swig_type_map.i. I write the ujmp typemap. so it is still have the error. sonney2k, i need have a check my typemap
 sploving	hmm, not work
 sploving	I think, i need to dive swig java doc more deeply

 serialhex	hey blackburn, whats going on?
 blackburn	hey, going fine! just get classic mds to work
 blackburn	will paste a link in a minute
 blackburn	what's up with you?
 serialhex	not too much, about to get to work wrtn some ruby examples
 blackburn	how is your work going on?
 blackburn	sold many ones? :)
 blackburn	well, data for mds: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/mds_data.png
 serialhex	ehh, i've sold ~$400 worth of knives, i need more appts
 blackburn	and result: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/mds_data_transformed.png
 serialhex	right now i'm below average :(
 serialhex	cool cool, it's spiraly!!!
 blackburn	oh it is more fast than LLE
 blackburn	~65s for 2000 3d examples
 serialhex	cool cool
 serialhex	so blackburn, how does the dim reduction work for cases where i might need that third dimension??
 blackburn	just the same
 blackburn	they all are hmmm
 blackburn	eh.. how to say that :)
 serialhex	so like if the spiral didnt contract/expand, it sould simply look like a circle
 blackburn	well if given data X
 blackburn	and we got x,y,z coordinates of embedding
 blackburn	so x,y will be 2d spiral
 blackburn	and z will be just like z in X
 blackburn	i.e. if map is 3d->3d it will stay the same
 serialhex	true
 serialhex	but if - as in your example - the 3d spiral dosnt shrink, the resulting 2d image will simply be a circle
 blackburn	i dk
 blackburn	'll test it right now
 serialhex	i'm not saying what you're doing is wrong, but the overall theory is kind of wonky imo... :P
 blackburn	not it should be a circle
 blackburn	it preserves distances
 serialhex	oh, ok
 blackburn	the key idea of MDS is to preserve distance
 blackburn	*pairwise distances
 serialhex	ok, that makes sense... because in your current example, if looked at from the top it might look like a couple of zig-zag lines... tho a spiffy alg would change that :D
 blackburn	hmm interesting thing with just flat spiral
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/spiral.png
 blackburn	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/spiral_transformed.png
 blackburn	serialhex: well these pictures show that idea more clearly
 blackburn	3d->2d is just the same spiral
 blackburn	in 2d*
 serialhex	hmm, ok
 blackburn	idk exactly how it will be proceed on different data
 blackburn	in fact it presents some suprises sometimes
 blackburn	for example when flat 3d data is given it have only 2 non-zero eigenvalues
 blackburn	if it is not flat - 3 non-zero eigs
 blackburn	looks like it reflects initial dimension somehow
 serialhex	hmm
 blackburn	I speak some broken way now :)
 serialhex	heh, well it's ok, you're trying to explain funky technical things, which is hard sometimes in ones native language :D
@bettyboo	funny?
 serialhex	yes it is funny bettyboo
@bettyboo	serialhex: for static interfaces like matlab you have to modify libshogunui/GUIKernel.cpp / SGInterface.cpp - not as nice but will work :)
 blackburn	serialhex: just tried for 3d parabola
 serialhex	cool
 blackburn	.. and it creates 3d parabola
 blackburn	:D
@bettyboo	;D blackburn
 blackburn	huh how useless it is for some data
 serialhex	you cant squinch to 2d??
 blackburn	i can't but it is done not that way I want
 blackburn	from side or so
 blackburn	right mapping should be just like circle
 serialhex	how about the top?
 serialhex	looking into the parabola...
 blackburn	aha
 blackburn	should be this way
 blackburn	I think the difference lies in parabola height
 blackburn	btw MDS for euclidean distance is equal to PCA :D
 blackburn	serialhex: well multiplying Z by 0.005 gave right mapping to 2d
 blackburn	haha
 blackburn	I had been using *deleted* array
 blackburn	serialhex: around?
 blackburn	ah, nevermind I found :)

@sonney2k	wtf?!
@sonney2k	now I am also getting baozengs error
 blackburn	with C++ you can not only make errors but also inherit it hehe
@bettyboo	hrhr
 serialhex	hey blackburn i'm here now, whats up??
 blackburn	serialhex: just english issue :)
 serialhex	oh, ok :)
 blackburn	forgot how to say about eigenvector's eigenvalue
 serialhex	sonney2k, baozeng wanted me to rub the java tests, how do i do that??  (i have 0 java expierence)
 blackburn	associated one
 serialhex	oh, ok... eigenvalues & such still kind of confuse me, mostly cause i havnt needed/studied them at all
 blackburn	serialhex: just wanted how to say that they are associated - now I know :)
 blackburn	wanted to know8
 blackburn	*
 serialhex	ok, cool
 serialhex	hmm... apparently the documentation is out of date, even when you generate it :(
 serialhex	STEAK!!!
