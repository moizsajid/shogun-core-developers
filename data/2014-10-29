 f0z_2	hey, anyone there?
 f0z_2	I was wondering if we can still work on the previous GSoC projects which were not selected.
@lisitsyn	f0z_2: hey
@lisitsyn	could you please elaborate?

 f0z_2_	i see parijat already worked on the project i was thinking of working on.
 f0z_2_	anyway, I'd like to contribute to shogun. Can you please tell me what i need to do to get started?
@lisitsyn	f0z_2_: I think good thing to start with is our github issues
@lisitsyn	f0z_2_: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues we have a bunch of things to work on actually
@lisitsyn	f0z_2_: but probably the better thing would be to try shogun on some task
@lisitsyn	and you'll see what you can improve
 f0z_2_	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2577
 f0z_2_	is this a good starting point?
@lisitsyn	f0z_2_: absolutely - if you don't find it boring
 f0z_2_	Thanks. Let me see what I can do. I'll get back to you if i find something or have any problems.

 paarth	Hi, I am a student from IIT Roorkee, India. I had taken up a machine learning course on coursera and have implemented most of the standard learning algorithms in octave. I want to contribute to shogun and have cloned the repository on my pc. I have tested some sample codes which used shogun library in c++. I have also gone through the developer tutorial and have an idea about the coding style. It would be great if you could suggest me some bugs I may work
 paarth	on or probably some other way in which I may contribute.

 srgnuclear	few bugs r diffcult to understand even though with entrance tag
