@lisitsyn	wiking: I see you're following this thing
@wiking	lisitsyn: just read
@wiking	fuck man
@wiking	this shit got crazy
@lisitsyn	wiking: yeah awful
@wiking	i just took a flight from europe to singapore on the weeekend...
@wiking	luckily i went via qatar
@wiking	altought on that route the ISIS people in syria and iraq could have taken down the plane...
@lisitsyn	wiking: I am darn sure who did that
@wiking	i guess some idiot civilian who doens't know how to read a radar sign that shows that he is about to shoot down a civilian (non military) plane...
@lisitsyn	wiking: I bet this missile thing can't tell civilian from non-civilian
@wiking	it can
@wiking	i mean the radar
@lisitsyn	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system
@lisitsyn	wiking: ^ it was this thing
@wiking	of course you can shoot anything with it
@lisitsyn	well any military thing would call itself a civilian then :)
@wiking	poor malaysian airlines... they really have a bad PR now :P
@lisitsyn	wiking: these 'rebels' reported they got some of these buk's just about 29th of june
@wiking	second plane in 6 months...
@wiking	lisitsyn: hthehehhehe yeah i saw the twit :D
@lisitsyn	and now they are just like we don't have any / these are broken / blabla
@wiking	lisitsyn: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NF6E5FCKFNEJ:https://twitter.com/dnrpress/status/483248037629018112
@lisitsyn	wiking: exactly
@wiking	but yeah taking down  big motherfucker 777 at 10000 meters...
@wiking	i mean you really need to be an idiot to not to know what are you about to shoot down...
@lisitsyn	wiking: haha they are
@wiking	it's big and it's at 10meters...
@wiking	10^4
@wiking	military plans are usually much smaller
@wiking	than a 777
@lisitsyn	wiking: I don't think they have exact sizes in this tracking system
@lisitsyn	wiking: bet these guys just shoot whatever they see
@wiking	ok an an-225 is not but still..
@wiking	lisitsyn: you can get proportions
@wiking	if you know how to read a radar of course
@wiking	you can tell the size of the object
@wiking	you can even see birds on radar
@wiking	but the one who is usually behind the radar has the basic training to be able to read it :P
@wiking	not just push the button :D
@lisitsyn	wiking: hah
@wiking	but yeah no sane person would shoot down a civilian plane

@lisitsyn	they are delivering videos like that all the time
@lisitsyn	so I don't think they are helpful there
@wiking	i mean i've read it somewhere that the separatists wants to find the blackbox first since it for sure has the info what really happened...

@wiking	"Figures are coming in: All 295 are dead. 80 are children. 23 are Americans."
@wiking	i guess hell is about to break loose
 dhruv13	that's sad
@wiking	lisitsyn: i cannot imagine what's in the person's head who actually pushed the button...
@lisitsyn	wiking: I can
@lisitsyn	wiking: they have total shit in their heads
@lisitsyn	wiking: I mean if it is these rebels who made it
@lisitsyn	they are absolutely insane
@lisitsyn	wiking: propaganda will tell its ukrainian forces - just because they did that once

@HeikoS	kislay: hey!
 kislay	I think now it will be fine
 kislay	Travis is full errored though. I have no idea why.
 kislay	But it seems unrelated
@HeikoS	kislay: so not yet working?
@HeikoS	ok we can restart then
@HeikoS	kislay can you send me the link or the pr?
 kislay	It still fails..all of them. There is something other than that. My other PR related to OpenCV is all failing.
 kislay	yeah..
 kislay	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2325
@HeikoS	kislay: mmmmh
@HeikoS	i will have a lok in a bit, currently reviewing a paper that has to be done by today
 kislay	sure sure
 kislay	np
@HeikoS	kislay: but hopefully this is finally done
 kislay	yeah! Me too hoping that
@HeikoS	kind of annoying that this takes so long. totally not your fault though, its this whole process
 kislay	I am a bit slow to grip..bit of my fault.
 kislay	but it should be working now
 kislay	had to create whole python 3 build locally.
 kislay	just like travis does
@HeikoS	kislay: ah man
@HeikoS	thats nonsense, this should be handled differently
@HeikoS	kislay: but not your fault, thanks for deatling with it!
 kislay	lambday did it differently earlier..some 3 months back
 kislay	But I haven't tried what he did. There should be a bit of documentation showing how it is done correctly.
