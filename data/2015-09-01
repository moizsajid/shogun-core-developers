 Arnei	Anybody around who might help me out? I think i managed to install shogun as well as the modular python interface under ubuntu 14, but i can't get python to find the shogun modules.
 lisitsyn	hey
 lisitsyn	Arnei: install like with 'make install'?
 Arnei	exactly that
 Arnei	Lots of people suggest setting PYTHONPATH in the .bashrc file, but that does not seem change anything
 lisitsyn	Arnei: sorry back
 lisitsyn	Arnei: what happens when you do 'import modshogun'?
 Arnei	it tells me that there is "no module named modshogun"
 lisitsyn	okie
 lisitsyn	Arnei: what did you do to compile python_modular interface?
 Arnei	I cloned the shogun-toolbox from github, build it via cmake with the command "cmake -DPythonModular=On -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/shogun-install".." and then ran "make install". That's roughly it.
@wiking	PYTHONPATH + LD_LIBRARY_PATH is your friend
 Arnei	i tried setting that in the .bashrc, but to no avail
 Arnei	to be more precise: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/shogun-install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
 Arnei	export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/shogun-install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:$HOME/shogun/examples/undocumented/python_modular:$PYTHONPATH
 lisitsyn	shogun-install or shoguninstall?
 lisitsyn	LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the second step
 lisitsyn	first you need to make it detectable by python
 lisitsyn	this is done via PYTHONPATH
 lisitsyn	I guess your path is not yet correct
 Arnei	aaah, i'm stumbling over the obvious again. Thanks, i'll see if correcting the paths will sort it out
 Arnei	Okay, i copy&pasted the paths from the filemanager, they should be correct now. But there still is "no module named modshogun"
 lisitsyn	Arnei: if you're setting .bashrc it could be that you didn't update it yet
 lisitsyn	if you haven't restarted bash, do 'source ~/.bashrc'
 Arnei	I've done that, but it changed nothing. Is 'source ~/.bashrc' supposed to give any feedback?
@besser82	Arnei, source ~/.bashrc ; echo $?   ---->  returns 0 if no error...
 Arnei	Sorry, i'm pretty new to Linux in general. At least i'm getting a 0.
 lisitsyn	Arnei: did that help?
 lisitsyn	wiking: besser82: guys?
 Arnei	Nope, still nothing
 lisitsyn	Arnei: is modshogun.so in the directory you pointed?
 Arnei	Yes, it is
 lisitsyn	Arnei: what if you do PYTHONPATH=this/directory/we/are/talking/about python -c 'import modshogun'?
 Arnei	PYTHONPATH=$HOME/arwilken/shogun-install../lib/python2.7/dist-packages python -c 'import modshogun'
 Arnei	ImportError: No module named modshogun
 lisitsyn	and ls "$HOME/arwilken/shogun-install../lib/python2.7/dist-packages" shows you modshogun.so?
 Arnei	it ... actually doesn't. wired, that is the location i found via the filemanager. and that is precisely the path it gave me.
 Arnei	*weird, not wired^^
 Arnei	oh wait, it does. nevermind
 Arnei	although it shows me "_modshogun.so", but i suppose that is what you meant
@wiking	mijauuuuu

 Arnei	Okay, somehow exchanging "$HOME" with "/home" did the trick. Looks like the imports work now.
 Arnei	Thanks a lot for your help and your patience :)
