 van51	anyone here?
@sonney2k	van51, yes?
@sonney2k	van51, btw I am going through your json fix currently...
 van51	sonney2k: ok, let me know..
 van51	actually I wanted to ask about that
 van51	I 've developed another entry patch
 van51	but I merged it with my develop branch
 van51	so, if I push it will also mess with the json PR, right?
@sonney2k	van51, well I use your patch only for inspiration as I would do the fix slightly differently - but still you've found the leaks so that helps a lot
@sonney2k	so if you do the PR against shogun:develop it should be OK

 van51	sonney2k: ok i did that
 van51	but now I shouldn't push on my develop branch right?
 van51	until the PR is reviewed that is
 van51	also I closed the json PR, since you 're on it :)
@sonney2k	van51, do you understand why the refcount for this thing is 2?
 van51	sonney2k: you mean for the first json_object?
@sonney2k	yes
 van51	nope :/
@sonney2k	van51, I think I understand now - in CSerializableJsonFile::init
@sonney2k	json_object_from_file & json_nobject_new_object
@sonney2k	both give an object with refcoutn 1
@sonney2k	the additional push_object leads to 2
@sonney2k	 * this object initially has sole ownership.  Remember, when using
@sonney2k	 * json_object_object_add or json_object_array_put_idx, ownership will
@sonney2k	 * transfer to the object/array.  Call json_object_get if you want to maintain
@sonney2k	 * shared ownership or also add this object as a child of multiple objects or
@sonney2k	 * arrays.  Any ownerships you acquired but did not transfer must be released
@sonney2k	 * through json_object_put.
@sonney2k	 *
@sonney2k	 * @returns a json_object of type json_type_object
@sonney2k	 */
@sonney2k	extern struct json_object* json_object_new_object(void);
@sonney2k	so we simply must not increse reference on the json root object
@sonney2k	that's all
 van51	i see, so by sole ownership it means refcount 1
 van51	ok
@sonney2k	or if we increase it
@sonney2k	decrease twice
 van51	we should decrease it twice
@sonney2k	yes
 van51	yea
@sonney2k	we are the sole owners of the root object
@sonney2k	we will never add it to another json object
@sonney2k	so refcount 1 is sufficient
 van51	ok. and how are you thinking of solving it now?
 van51	you won't increase it?
 van51	btw, the description on my local json_object.h file is much smaller :P
 van51	* Create a new empty object
 van51	 * @returns a json_object of type json_type_object
 van51	 */
@sonney2k	van51, yeah I checked out sources
@sonney2k	also json_object_put will return 0 if the object is freed in the new code
@sonney2k	currently it is void
@sonney2k	van51, yeah I will not increase the refcount for root that's all
 van51	it will return just 0 then, or the ref_count in general?
 van51	because I was looking for a method to get the reference counter then
@sonney2k	van51, not the refcount
@sonney2k	but 0 or 1
@sonney2k	anyway you can use some hack and do obj->_ref_count
@sonney2k	access to a private field though
 van51	I was saving that for later :p
 van51	and by that I mean I had completely given up on reading the counter

 van51	sonney2k: ok I see
 van51	i'm gonna go now - zzZZzzzz
 van51	I'm thinking of tackling tomorrow one of the issues you just published
@wiking	mmm
@wiking	what's this activity at 5 in the morning? :)
 van51	i'm getting a "Branches 'develop' and 'origin/develop' have diverged.
 van51	Branches need merging first." message
 van51	does it have to do with the running PR?
 van51	wiking: hehe that's what happens you drink a lot of coffee :P
@sonney2k	van51, it is probably due to your json fix commit
* sonney2k ZZzzzz
 van51	ok fixed it :D

 van51	hello, I have a question.. I noticed that there are 3 similar classes, namely DynArray, CDynamicArray and CDynamicObjectArray
 van51	is CDynamicArray just a wrapper for DynArray and we are supposed to use that one for general storage, while using CDynamicObjectArray when storing CSGObject objects?
