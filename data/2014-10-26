@thoralf	wiking: Yo:)
@wiking	ok so i guess it's shogun hackers time there then :)
@thoralf	Yeah, 21:11.
@wiking	good it's 12:11 here
@wiking	(12:11pm)
@wiking	so i'm in the future :P
* thoralf trying to understand SHOGUN.
@thoralf	Ever tried? ;)
@wiking	hehehe
@wiking	mmm refactoring cmake
@wiking	at this very moment
@thoralf	Which goal does your refactoring have?
@wiking	packaging
@wiking	rpm, deb etc.
@thoralf	I see.
@thoralf	I just saw that buildbot is in bad condition.
@thoralf	Failing since ages.
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	ineed
@wiking	*indeed*
@wiking	btw what's uint64_t on a linux machine?
@wiking	unsigned long long, no?
 naywhayare	usually but I don't think that's guaranteed (hello from next to thoralf!)
 naywhayare	I thought that if you were on i686 it was unsigned long long but x86_64 it was unsigned long (although I guess in that case ull is 64 bits too)
@wiking	naywhayare: aaah siiiiiit
@wiking	shiiiit
@wiking	that's it!
@wiking	uint64_t = unsigned long on amd64
@wiking	right?
 naywhayare	if you can assume C99 then you can just #include <stdint.h>
@wiking	naywhayare: yeah we have that
@wiking	it's only that i'm having troubles here understanding
@wiking	that on a 64 bit linux os
@wiking	CGPUVector<uint64_t>;
@wiking	does not fail
@wiking	but on osx 64bit it does
 naywhayare	yeah, things can be totally different on OS X
@wiking	and for some reason this because
@wiking	on osx uint64_t = unsigned long long
 shogun-buildbot	build #908 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed notebooks]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/908  blamelist: lambday <heavensdevil6909@gmail.com>, jiaolong <jiaolongxu@gmail.com>, Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, Soumyajit De <heavensdevil6909@gmail.com>, Thoralf Klein <thoralf@fischlustig.de>,

@wiking	linux uint64_t = unsigned long
 naywhayare	and CGPUVector<unsigned long long> fails?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	because viennacl doesnt have template
 naywhayare	ah, okay
@wiking	for unsigned long long
@wiking	only for unsigned long
 naywhayare	maybe you can do something with #ifdefs... #ifdef OSX typedef unsigned long u64_type; #else typedef uint64_t u64_type; #endif
@wiking	well it doesn't even have long long interface either :)
 naywhayare	Armadillo (matrix library) has to do stuff like that so they can have a portable u64 type
 naywhayare	you could take a look at what they do... in include/armadillo_bits/typedef.hpp
@wiking	this is effing crazy
@wiking	ok nevermind
@wiking	i'm now just ignoring this for the moment :)))
 naywhayare	:)
@wiking	wanna finish at least something today
 naywhayare	I know the feeling
 naywhayare	I was working on some slides then suddenly *poof* my laptop died
@wiking	fuuuck
 naywhayare	four hours of walking and now I have a chromebook
@wiking	that's too bad
@wiking	san jose? :)
 naywhayare	yeah
@wiking	yeah why didn't u take the bart to downtown?
@wiking	san jose is deadville
 naywhayare	I'm sitting at the same table as heiko, thoralf, and fernando
 naywhayare	well, there was a store nearby, so I just walked
@wiking	hehe cool hacking time
 naywhayare	san jose is very spread out... everything is very far apart
@wiking	yeah i know
 naywhayare	hard to be here without a car, and bus service is spotty and slow
@wiking	been there
 naywhayare	yeah
@HeikoS	wiking: check out the new swig stats
@HeikoS	wiking: just need to make travis working but thats soon
@wiking	HeikoS: stats? where?
@wiking	HeikoS: we should be trying to modularize again swig interface :P
@wiking	that way things would be solved
@wiking	i dont know if that's possible though
@wiking	sonney2k: was mentioning that he tried and it was a failuer
@wiking	but i think it was still swig1.x era
@HeikoS	wiking: I know
@HeikoS	but we just reduced compile memory by 500mb
@HeikoS	wiking: we should separate swig for core shogun and the algorihtms, that should help later on
@wiking	that's awesome
@HeikoS	wiking: check my pr

@HeikoS	wiking: awesome
@HeikoS	wiking: will check out coverty, could you put an issue for the milestone? then its easier to remember for all of us
@wiking	i have already the deb packages
@HeikoS	wiking: so if we have 0 warnings, much less coverty errors, and the ubuntu, we can release

@HeikoS	wiking: and spam all social media
@wiking	HeikoS: i have major troubles now with modular interfaces on osx
@wiking	so that needs to be fixed as well :)))
@HeikoS	wiking: ok :)
@HeikoS	wiking: well
@HeikoS	wiking: btw thoralf hacked something that allows to compile just a single shogun class (and its dependencies) and run tests
@HeikoS	wiking: might help when debugging things
@HeikoS	wiking: see email
@thoralf	HeikoS: I wouldn't say that too loud... it's really hacky.

@HeikoS	wiking: awesome :)
@HeikoS	thoralf: not me
@HeikoS	thoralf: think release ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: warnings, coverty problems, bits and pieces
@thoralf	Naaah.
@HeikoS	thoralf: we should do all big refactoring after release ;)

@thoralf	Audio is important :)
 naywhayare	:)
@HeikoS	wiking: iglesiasg and me are strongly considering dropping the integration testing, and just only running all python examples without comparing their output, what are your thoughts? lisitsyn, thoralf ?
@thoralf	HeikoS: What do we gain?
@HeikoS	wiking: we just spend like 30 mins trying to update 2 of them
@HeikoS	tester.py, generator.py are horrible things
@HeikoS	lots of overhead, no use
@HeikoS	we gain efficiency
@HeikoS	and slimness
@HeikoS	at least thats the idea
@HeikoS	;)
@thoralf	What happens if you mix booze+karaoke+jam-session?

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: remove integration tests, first step
@lisitsyn	and it tries all the possible combinations
@lisitsyn	int function(int x, double y);
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: sorry for all the pushed
@lisitsyn	it tries negative x, positive x, zero x, so on
@HeikoS	its feature branches and I confused something
@HeikoS	got two now
@lisitsyn	oops
@lisitsyn	need any assistance?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: no its good
@HeikoS	one branch for remove migration framework
@HeikoS	but that fails all integration tests
@HeikoS	so other branch is removing them, and replaces things by other ones
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: I was a bit lost what's left to release?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: warnings, ubuntu maybe, and coverty issues
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: and lots of soft stuff, like blog, announcement, pictures, NEWS
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: want to update the NEWS file to feature GSoC?
@HeikoS	ah getting lunch now
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes can do that tomorrow
@HeikoS	google buffet is closing
@lisitsyn	HeikoS: when do you want to release?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: warnings would also be good
@lisitsyn	ok sure go take it ;)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: ask wiking but asap
