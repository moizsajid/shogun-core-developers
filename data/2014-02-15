 pranet	Hi. Am getting a "no module named shogun" error when doing "import shogun" in python. Any tips?
-!- ajgar [7aa7f31e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.122.167.243.30] has joined #shogun
 besser82	pranet:  are you using python_modular from shogun?
 ajgar	I installed shogun cloning from github but I'm having trouble with the library path.. can anyone help me..?
 besser82	pranet:  then you should import "modshogun"  ;)
 besser82	ajgar:  currently no, unfortunately.  But I'll be back in ~one and a half hour to help you  ;)
 besser82	ajgar:  I think we can work stuff out then  ;)
 ajgar	besser82 no problem.. thanks a lot.. :)
 pranet	ajgar. what problem with library path?
 pranet	besser: umn nop. il try that
 pranet	ajgar: is it the missing .so files?
 ajgar	pranet: after "make all" , i did a sudo make install
 ajgar	this is supposed to add libshogun to usr/lib right..?
 pranet	u might have to run ldconfig explicitly. that worked for me
 ajgar	ok thanks. can you pls elaborate more on that..?
 pranet	have you tried compiling a cpp program yet?
 ajgar	i did. compilation failed saying
 ajgar	fatal error: shogun/base/init.h: No such file or directory
 pranet	hmn ya i got that too. leme remember what i did
 pranet	first try "ldconfig" in terminal
 pranet	see if that helps
 ajgar	it compiles if i explicity pass paths to lib and include folders.
 ajgar	like this. g++ -I/path_to_include _L/path_to_lib test.cpp -lshogun
-!- Saurabh7 [~Saurabh7@117.235.134.71] has joined #shogun
 ajgar	pranet ldconfig did not work :(
 pranet	hmn . sec
 pranet	need to find out how to add the libs to default path
 pranet	does ur usr/local/include have shogun?
 ajgar	let me check
 ajgar	no it does not.
 pranet	hmn ya thats the problem. now lets see how to add it
 pranet	this is how u installed right?
 pranet	1. go to the shogun repository root 2. do `mkdir build` 3. do `cmake [options] ..` (or `ccmake ..` if available). It is very recommended to use any of CMake GUIs (such as ccmake) if you feel unsure about possible parameters and configurations. 4. do `make` (and `sudo make install` if needed)
 ajgar	yes
 ajgar	I used these options with cmake. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DTRACE_MEMORY_ALLOCS=OFF -DPythonModular=ON -DBUILD_DASHBOARD_REPORTS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$BUILDDIR/install"
 pranet	hmnn
 pranet	well if u just want a working fix i could mail u the folder ur supposed to paste in usr/local/include. that may work
 pranet	or just try pasting ur src/shogun folder there
 ajgar	i read that copy pasting into usr/local/include could be dangerous and should not be done.. anyhow its working if I pass the path in arguments..
 ajgar	I have already spent a lot of time setting up all the dependencies. I dont want to break anything.. :D
 pranet	oh didnt know about that.
 pranet	well technically since the locatin is empty how could it be dangerous
 pranet	worst case it doesnt work, u just delete it
 pranet	again , just an opinion :P
 ajgar	I am not sure how it is dangerous..
 ajgar	its working for now..let it be like this until a proper fix can be found. pls do tell me if you figure it out..
 ajgar	and thanks a lot for the help.. :)

 suryak	I have hands on experience in Machine Learning.. in which I know algorithms like logistic regression, k-means clustering, svm
 suryak	and regarding programming background - I know Python, and little bit of MATLAB; I have previously done some Web programming in Django
 suryak	so, basically, is there anyone I can talk to on the ideas, I appreciate; thanks

@iglesiasg	I could really be using some help while I am building the website with the project ideas
@iglesiasg	something as simple as proof-reading could help me a lot

 lisitsyn	repo?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, yes
@HeikoS	iglesiasg:  hi!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what repo? ;)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, aah the one in the mail
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, https://github.com/iglesias/shogun-gsoc2014-ideas
 lisitsyn	righto
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: what do you move to the webpage right now?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I just pushed the last part I have stable
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so pretty much, now the ideas that are really small are left, so very little work
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think I can do that all right, but someone should proof read
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: let me add a few more words to kevin's opencv thing
@iglesiasg	and also, I guess the ideas that are small should be improved
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, mmmm
 lisitsyn	could you push it to the page then?
@iglesiasg	how should we do it?
@iglesiasg	soon we will start having things in two places
@iglesiasg	so I guess it is not good to update the drive more
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well true for ideas that are online
 lisitsyn	but these are not
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn,  I am touching the HTML for these ones right now :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: ahh
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, let me push the opencv right now for you
 lisitsyn	so you have them in the html right now?
@iglesiasg	and you can go on with the html, all right?

@iglesiasg	haha
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, ok! I just pushed everything
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: cool thanks
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, so I have put the output kernel learning project as placeholder
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, you can find the project you want to modify by having a look at the comments
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, for instance, <!-- OPENCV PROJECT IDEA -->
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: alright
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I am working on the remaining of ML tasks now, so we try to avoid conflicts when merging later

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, still there?

@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, just opencv left to remove all placeholders
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, maybe we could push something even if it is not completed?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah sure
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, PR-me baby :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: will be back in a few mins
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, ok, then let me push the current version in the google docs

@sonney2k	HeikoS, hey - did you find the time to write this 'how to do gsoc with us' document?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: not yet, but will start tonight
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I am just now looking at the ideas page. Looks like the creating packages & win32 port is missing and also shogun & teaching.
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I am not sure about the RBM stuff - I think a NN framework that is trained based on standard algorithms would be more valuable
@sonney2k	(standard algorithms == already available implementations)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: all this deep learning stuff is all massively depending on implementation details, so I would rather interface to existing ones
@HeikoS	yeah the packageing is important, and teaching .....
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we have 2 labs supporting us with the teaching thing at least partially
@sonney2k	HeikoS, and this would 'just' mean write good notebooks and demos
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	its a bit hard with mentors
@HeikoS	but since this stuff is not so much about Shogun, it might be easier
* sonney2k is reading the python3.3.4 source code to understand pickling
@HeikoS	whoooo :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi! how is it going with the kernel->clone() issue? I've fixed parameter's hashing framework a little bit. Now GPs are training one time.
@HeikoS	votjakovr: great work!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah I looked into that, it has to do with SGVectors of CSGObjects
 votjakovr	HeikoS: But it depends on kernel->clone()
@HeikoS	I think this case not not handled properly
@HeikoS	so adding a unit test for that would help (it would fail for now)
@HeikoS	and then trying to find out the issue
@HeikoS	I am not sure I even thought about that when I wrote the clone stuff (the vector of sgobjects case)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I will get back on that later today and/or tomorrow
@HeikoS	but cool that the GPs are faster now!
@HeikoS	I am using them quite a bit for my research btw
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep, I'll send a PR after kernel->clone() problem will be fixed
@HeikoS	votjakovr: thanks!
 votjakovr	HeikoS: Also i thought about adding numerical derivation to SHOGUN to find kernel derivatives wrt parameters, for which we can't do that analytically.
 votjakovr	HeikoS: what do you think about that?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I agree on that, should be general purpose and a fall back option
@HeikoS	yes, good idea1!
@HeikoS	if you want to work on that
@HeikoS	thats even a whole gsoc project, and very useful for various things
@HeikoS	in general automagic differentiation btw
@HeikoS	also non-numerical variants
@HeikoS	I gotta go now, so lets discuss later
@HeikoS	but yeah +1 from my side :)
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, thanks :) i'll think about that
-!- votjakovr [~votjakovr@188.134.46.30] has quit [Quit: WeeChat 0.4.0]
@sonney2k	I think torch, theano and caf* all have nice impl's written in C underneath that we might be able to use
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ^
@sonney2k	HeikoS, also it seems a bit easier than interfacing SVMs since they don't share a common kernel
@sonney2k	HeikoS, just some weights / architecture we have to pass to them and which training algo to use
@sonney2k	HeikoS, and then fetch all the results back in
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah exactly, much better, and we can plug things together with the rest of shogun
@HeikoS	so no need to implement those things
@HeikoS	which is hard and messy
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sounds like my shogun vision (tm) :D
 lisitsyn	just a thing that ties various things together
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what's with fastfood? is it pt.2?

 parijat	sonney2k: hi, I know you guys are busy with gsoc. I had a doubt regarding PCA. Is it a good time to discuss?
 parijat	sonney2k: the file was probably written by you so thats why I am reaching out to you
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am testing your file soon, let me see
 parijat	iglesiasg: alright! thanks.
@iglesiasg	parijat, so there are a couple of things here
@iglesiasg	parijat, first, you should set the target  dimension before calling init
 parijat	iglesiasg:  tried that as well. doesnt rectify the error
@iglesiasg	parijat, that will still give you a 3x4 matrix
@iglesiasg	parijat, you can check that it does different things by looking at the dimension of the matrix outputted by get_transformation_matrix
 parijat	iglesiasg: yup but my target dimension is 2 right? so i am expecting 2x4 matrix
@iglesiasg	parijat, it would make sense if it does the operation in place, but I am not sure
 parijat	iglesiasg: if you run kernelPCA instead with say gaussian kernel, it works perfect. I get a 2x4 matrix as output
 parijat	iglesiasg: thats why i think there might be something wrong going on in PCA
@iglesiasg	parijat, in PCA::apply_to_feature_matrix for some reason it is fixed that the output has the same dimensions of the input
@iglesiasg	parijat, I don't really understand why though. I think you are right and it should output a 2x4
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya saw that! but that doesn't make sense
@iglesiasg	parijat, I mean that code is really crazy for what it actually has to do...
@iglesiasg	which is just a matrix multiplication
 parijat	iglesiasg: :D
@iglesiasg	parijat, that is probably one of the things that Heiko meant when he said that (K)PCA could be pretty much rewritten
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: remember we have it in tapkee? ;)
@iglesiasg	parijat, anyhow I would say you can do like this. For your example now, work with the matrix transformation given by PCA. You can do the product in Python easily
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I don't actually!
 parijat	iglesiasg: i tried printing the matrix m at the end of each iteration. 2 of 3 dimensions are updated per iteration. Its crazy! you should try that
 parijat	iglesiasg: ok alright! let me try that
@iglesiasg	parijat, I used PCA for LMNN just using the outputted matrix transformation, so that should be ok
 parijat	iglesiasg: alright I will have a look at your code for reference as well.
 parijat	iglesiasg: but we should also try fixing this PCA bug (if there is one) sometime soon :)
@iglesiasg	parijat, yeah sure. It would be nice to remove the operations that use cblas there and use eigen to start with
@iglesiasg	parijat, take it as another entrance related to the fundamental ML project if you want ;)
 parijat	iglesiasg: :D ya sure! my pleasure.
 parijat	iglesiasg: thanks for looking into this.
@iglesiasg	no problem!
@iglesiasg	parijat, I am just going to answer the mail in the mailing list so there is an answer there
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya sure go ahead. I was just going through the pca transform used in LMNN, I am mostly just translating the code to python :)

@iglesiasg	parijat, all right! Probably you just need to do get_transformation_matrix to get the PCA matrix and then numpy.dot to perform matrix multiplication between the feature matrix and the transformation matrix
-!- zxtx [~zv@c-98-223-196-32.hsd1.in.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya, but before that subtracting out the mean is also necessary maybe?
@iglesiasg	parijat, that is an additional step you may or may not do
@iglesiasg	parijat, I see that the PCA code does it, but it is not a compulsory step in standard PCA (I believe)
 parijat	iglesiasg: ya thats why I planned on doing it. Maybe I will do it anyways. It isn't much of a work
