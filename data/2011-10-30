 blackburn	1) it is at least 4x faster on big dataset than LTSA itself (with the same results)
 blackburn	2) it makes possible to construct embeddings of RKHS

@sonney2k	blackburn1, what things do we still have on radar before we do a new release?
@sonney2k	blackburn1, btw I managed to compile everything except for the octave interfaces with clang++ now :)
@sonney2k	and good news requiring < 1GB of memory
 blackburn1	sonney2k: oh I lost the way to release
 blackburn1	we should think about it once again
