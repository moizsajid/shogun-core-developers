@sonney2k	blackburn, I received my GSoC t-shirt today
@sonney2k	though it is more like a gsoc coat
@sonney2k	or I lost weight and height :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: exactly
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is big even for me
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is big for gsomix as well
 blackburn	they probably doubled the size
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	blackburn, well I ordered size L
@sonney2k	but got XL
@sonney2k	they probably want me to become american or so ;-)
@sonney2k	at least food style wise
 blackburn	sonney2k: I ordered XL probably and got a thing to cover a tank
@sonney2k	blackburn, good thing is one does not need to wear pants :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah but that kind of style is not that common unfortunately
 blackburn	and pretty cold here :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, freezing already in Siberia?
 blackburn	sonney2k: +13 outside
 blackburn	in siberia they should have snow already i think
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am currently working on the second test task that company gave - they asked me to do that in MS VS
 blackburn	it is *UNUSABLE*
 blackburn	I can't believe somebody uses that
 wiking	i've got M but it is like L or XL
 wiking	sonney2k: how's the static analyzer going with the bot?
