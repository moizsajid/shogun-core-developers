 sploving	hello all
-!- blackburn [~qdrgsm@188.168.4.214] has joined #shogun
 sploving	hell blackburn
 blackburn	hell? :D
 sploving	my git met a mess problem
 blackburn	what kind of?
 sploving	To git@github.com:sploving/shogun.git
 sploving	 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast forward)
 sploving	have you met this problem
 blackburn	hmm
 sploving	I commit a patch, but found not well. then I tried to use git commit --amend
 sploving	and git push
 sploving	it shows the above error
 sploving	I spent almost a whole afternoon:(
 blackburn	sploving: did you tried to git pull before?
 sploving	blackburn, I tried. it said,Auto-merged src/java_modular/shogun/examples/VectorTest.java
 sploving	CONFLICT (content): merge conflict in src/java_modular/shogun/examples/VectorTest.java
 blackburn	hmm
 sploving	blackburn, do you know who are responsible for the github when sonney2k is away/
 blackburn	sploving: I think no one :)
 sploving	blackburn, then how to commit?
 blackburn	sploving: I think we have to wait a little
 sploving	blackburn, could I re fork?
 blackburn	sploving: just do a pull request if you want
 blackburn	sploving: copy-paste your git status somewhere
 blackburn	e.g. pastebin or etc
 sploving	git pull "You are in the middle of a conflicted merge"
 blackburn	ok, we should resolve that conflict
 blackburn	sploving: please 'git status' and paste it somewher
 sploving	blackburn,ok
 blackburn	sploving: btw it is your fork, right?
 sploving	yep
 sploving	do you have another quick way to refork my branch?
 blackburn	what do you mean saying refork?
 sploving	I mean redownload my branch
 blackburn	just 'git clone' it again if you want
 blackburn	in some other dir
 blackburn	btw why you did git commit --amend?
 sploving	blackburn, my commit is not perfect
 blackburn	ah
 sploving	I mean i lost some file
 blackburn	sploving: just paste git status, may be I will see something and could help you
 sploving	blackburn,http://pastebin.com/tyheU7M9
 blackburn	aha I see
 blackburn	sploving: you can see you have 2 files unmerged and modified
 sploving	yep
 sploving	blackburn, then how to update?
 blackburn	try to git add src/java_modular/build.xml
 blackburn	and git add src/java_modular/shogun/examples/VectorTest.java
 blackburn	then git status and take a look if it is changed
 blackburn	or you can git merge master
 blackburn	I really don't know why you have had a conflict
 blackburn	did somebody changed files you work with?
 blackburn	sploving: so what's up?
 blackburn	sploving: if you will have this problem just do 'git reset --merge'
 blackburn	after that you will be able to git pull and all the things
 sploving	blackburn, git reset will make my new file lose?
 blackburn	sploving: yeap, just save it somewhere, then git reset, then replace it again and git commit
 sploving	blackburn, git reset HEAD?
 blackburn	you can try it too, but 'git reset --merge' could resolve your unmerged files
 sploving	blackburn, I will have a try
 blackburn	sploving: why you have such conflict?
 blackburn	I mean was it changed somewhere outside your fork?
 sploving	no. maybe I used git revert
 sploving	blackburn, are you sure git reset --merege?
 sploving	usage: git-reset [--mixed | --soft | --hard] [-q] [<commit-ish>] [ [--] <paths>...]
 sploving	it saids above
 blackburn	hm
 blackburn	sploving: git merge master
 sploving	Already up-to-date
 blackburn	sploving: are these unmerged files in git status?
 sploving	blackburn, yeap
 blackburn	sploving: did you saved that files?
 blackburn	sploving: if so just try to git reset --hard HEAD
 blackburn	the simpliest way I think
 sploving	that works
 blackburn	sploving: so just replace files by new ones and then commit and push, I think it will work too
 blackburn	I hadn't any experience of such conflicts resolving
 sploving	yeap. I will have a try
