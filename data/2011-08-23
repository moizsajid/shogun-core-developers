@sonney2k	blackburn, so lua / ruby examples install nicely now
 blackburn	ok
@sonney2k	and make check-examples should work for them
@sonney2k	(they take the library path etc from the installed dir I hope)
@sonney2k	now csharp/java is still not resolved
@sonney2k	otherwise documentation and automated install and of course migration stuff
@sonney2k	then we are good
 blackburn	java classpath things are ugly
@sonney2k	horrible
 blackburn	I'm now trying to write simple clojure example
@sonney2k	there is no standard for where to install java extensions (like /usr/include / usr/lib)
 blackburn	what is default classpath in debian
 blackburn	?
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw it is possible to create some ShogunLoader loading shogun and changing classpath internally
 blackburn	System.setProperty("java.library.path","path")
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is none
 blackburn	eh?
@sonney2k	I think they are planning to do implemnt sth like that
@sonney2k	extension are however usually under /usr/share/java/xxx.jar
 blackburn	who they?
@sonney2k	the pkg-java team
 blackburn	how is it related?
 blackburn	we do export classpath in our check.sh
 blackburn	anyway we shouldn't do export
 blackburn	I would like to change it now
 blackburn	fail
@sonney2k	blackburn, IMHO the examples should all assume that things are in CLASSPATH already
@sonney2k	no messing around with classpath direcly
 blackburn	sonney2k: sure but we can avoid export
@sonney2k	blackburn, I will remove all export etc stuff from examples
@sonney2k	blackburn, it really should be
@sonney2k	configure
@sonney2k	make
@sonney2k	make install
@sonney2k	make check-examples
 blackburn	it is the thing I'm trying to do now
@sonney2k	(so things are in desired locations and should run)
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw the shop where I ordered the new machine sent me a dhl tracking #
@sonney2k	so 1-2 days from now and all good again I hope :)
 blackburn	why didn't you buy it in real shop?
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't have time to go to a real shop
 blackburn	wo
 blackburn	w
 blackburn	if you don't overstate this I can't imagine your life :D
 blackburn	okay fuck it, I hate this classpath/libpath conception
 blackburn	I would better do something else

 blackburn	sonney2k: get_num_bits_in_histogram()=5 > get_num_bits()=2
