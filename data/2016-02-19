@wiking	anybody around?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
@wiking	ok so i wanna run an idea with you
@wiking	it's stupid devops
@wiking	there's this magical thing from travis
@wiking	https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/
@wiking	lisitsyn: ideas?
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: uhmm what exactly do you want?
@wiking	hehehe fix travis builds
@wiking	because i think since 2014
@wiking	that thing is not stable
@wiking	:D
@wiking	and now with gsoc coming on us
@wiking	with the PRS
 lisitsyn	wiking: what does docker give us?
@wiking	it'd be good to have it green again
@wiking	well so the thing is that
@wiking	i could create a docker container
-!- bhupendra_singh [~bhupendra@103.37.201.105] has joined #shogun
@wiking	that container already all the dependencies we want/need
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh ok I see
@wiking	any insights?
 lisitsyn	wiking: what repo does it use?
@wiking	for?
@wiking	the docker image?
 lisitsyn	wiking: yes
@wiking	the registry.hub.docker.com
 lisitsyn	oh ok
@wiking	so it's public
@wiking	i could put together a docker image
 lisitsyn	wiking: so we just push our docker
@wiking	yes
 lisitsyn	wiking: well sounds valid, how can I help?
@wiking	nono just that
@wiking	or one more thing
@wiking	oh no
@wiking	it's ok
@wiking	so i was wondering how to get the src into the docker container
@wiking	but based on the
@wiking	scripts
@wiking	i can run like any sorts of command
@wiking	meaning i could just simply mount in the checked out git repo from the host machine
@wiking	ahahah
@wiking	one funny thing
@wiking	dense matrix
@wiking	[10K,100]
@wiking	shogun [47] time=0.048s
@wiking	sklearn [44] time=0.067s
@wiking	[100K,100]
@wiking	shogun [52] time=0.533s
@wiking	sklearn [51] time=0.754s
@wiking	[1M,100]
@wiking	shogun [42] time=7.970s
@wiking	sklearn [45] time=14.65s
 lisitsyn	wiking: what is timed?
@wiking	train
@wiking	ok so where should we store the magic docker?
@wiking	i mean Dockerfile
@wiking	mmm there's this
@wiking	configs/Dockerfile
@wiking	:))))
@wiking	no that would be to fast no way that guy had such a good machine
@wiking	it was prediction
@wiking	man that docker file is from 2014
