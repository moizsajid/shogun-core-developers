 blackburn	sonne|work: I have reproduced custom kernel error..
 blackburn	setting triangle from full fails, will try to fix today
 blackburn	then if you will manage to detect HMM or SVMs errors we can release
 sonne|work	blackburn: hi
 blackburn	hi
 sonne|work	I noticed that 10 tests or so are failing on the train ride to work
 sonne|work	not the old tests but the newer ones (python tester.py )
 sonne|work	I've debugged a few - but it still needs work also from you ...
 blackburn	sonne|work: do you remember any?
 sonne|work	all the converters have no test
 blackburn	sonne|work: converters tests is difficult task
 sonne|work	basically for non-existent tests one needs to call python generator.py <filename_of_the_python_foo>
 blackburn	sonne|work: I did tell you already, there is problems..
 sonne|work	yeah but we need something reasonable... maybe you can come up with something
 blackburn	damn, there are
 blackburn	sonne|work: I can but I need time, I think it would be ok to do it later
 blackburn	sonne|work: almost all of them requires to add some self-testing methods I can use in python
 sonne|work	I think this is really important - otherwise we won't know if we broke anything
 blackburn	sonne|work: I know status of converters 24h a week ;)
 sonne|work	I don't have time now to discuss but lets do this maybe tonight
 blackburn	sonne|work: but others - yes, we should fix it
 blackburn	okay
 sonne|work	(I thought so too about several other components btw)
 sonne|work	cu
 blackburn	I will be online from 23-30 UTC+4
 blackburn	cu

 blackburn	sonney2k: I wonder why almost all tests are 'ERROR' :D
 blackburn	bugs.. I haz it
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r77c55d7 / (2 files): fix library and evaluation test - http://git.io/iCkWjA

@sonney2k	blackburn, here maybe 3-4 tests fail + all the converter_* ones
 blackburn	sonney2k: 50% here
 blackburn	just like united russia election result
@sonney2k	united we stand
@sonney2k	wait
@sonney2k	this happens when you do python tester.py?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ERROR OK ERROR OK ..
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	yes or no?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah sorry yes
 blackburn	wait
 blackburn	python modular?
@sonney2k	yes the others don't support that
 blackburn	then yes
@sonney2k	I have an error only in preprocessor_dimensionreductionpreprocessor_modular.py + converter_*
 blackburn	lol
@sonney2k	so which is the first test failing for you?
 blackburn	regression_krr_modular.py setting 1/2                        ERROR
 blackburn	regression_krr_modular.py setting 2/2                        ERROR
 blackburn	regression_libsvr_modular.py setting 1/2                     ERROR
 blackburn	regression_libsvr_modular.py setting 2/2                     ERROR
 blackburn	regression_svrlight_modular.py setting 1/2                   ERROR
 blackburn	regression_svrlight_modular.py setting 2/2                   ERROR
 blackburn	these ones for example
@sonney2k	you don't have lapack/atlas?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I thought I have
@sonney2k	or let me guess different cpu / optimization flags different results?
@sonney2k	I made it easy to investigate
@sonney2k	just run python tester.py -d regression_krr_modular.py
@sonney2k	you will get detailled debug output and be in pdb to investigate
@sonney2k	there are two variables then a and b
 shogun-buildbot	build #361 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/r_static/builds/361  blamelist: sonne@debian.org
@sonney2k	both should be lists
@sonney2k	with the things returned by this function
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw did you do git submodule update?
@sonney2k	not that we have different versions of data...
 blackburn	sonney2k: minute
@sonney2k	I now forcefully enabled all tests checks in buildbot

 blackburn	mismatch
 blackburn	hm not really much
@sonney2k	that explains it though
 blackburn	sonney2k: how?
@sonney2k	different atlas etc lib / cpu etc and so different results
@sonney2k	these things are strict 100% exact match tests to determine if anything changes...
 blackburn	sonney2k: oh that's pretty bad way to test machine learning algos
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have no atlas btw
@sonney2k	it is very tough to figure out if your eps change is due to a bug or sth else
@sonney2k	so running things twice should give 100% same result
 blackburn	twice sure, but different machines..
@sonney2k	of course this assumes you can init the random number generator etc
@sonney2k	sure
@sonney2k	that's true but for that one could easily introduce a numerical comparison and allow for some slack
 blackburn	sonney2k: I do not really know but I have x86 ubuntu here, while you have 64
@sonney2k	tester.py is not that difficult to read and whenever we have floats/numpy matrices we could do a lossy test (if enabled at cmdline)
 blackburn	it does matter sometimes
@sonney2k	problem is that it is not clear how much slack to allow
@sonney2k	floating point crap is awful
@sonney2k	e.g. a 1e-16 difference might lead to a 1e-2 difference in e.g. svm training
@sonney2k	and this could easily be a newly introduced bug (like forgotten variable to add or so)
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have added a little slack
 blackburn	distances are ok now
 blackburn	but svms are not
@sonney2k	optional please
@sonney2k	(like the -d option with -s --slack)
@sonney2k	yeah
 blackburn	kernels are halfly ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: something is really wrong with subgradient, sgd and ocas
@sonney2k	sgd and ocas work just fine here
@sonney2k	subgradient yes broken
@sonney2k	well very random
 blackburn	sonney2k: then everything should look ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: have you ran ./test_all?
@sonney2k	yes - I'd like to get rid of these tests though
@sonney2k	that is the stuff we wanted to get rid of for 1.0.0
@sonney2k	but failed
 blackburn	sonney2k: how much errors did you have?
@sonney2k	subgradientsvm, sgd (but this can be ignored we changed default args and that is tested), hmm, localalignment, oligo string, FK, TOP
@sonney2k	that's it
@sonney2k	btw we should have these new tests for python-static too
@sonney2k	but hell no we dont' have them for matlab/octave/r/...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm worried only about HMM :)
 blackburn	I have never used to use it but
@sonney2k	blackburn, so can you come up with some way that we can test your dim red stuff?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes but not now
@sonney2k	how long do you think will you need? I would rather not want to release with new functions that dont' have tests
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have to write complex tests
@sonney2k	why?
 shogun-buildbot	build #63 of nightly_default is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/63
 blackburn	sonney2k: e.g. to test isomap I have to check if geodesic distances are ~
@sonney2k	can't you just apply $DIMREDMETHOD and compute $SCORE and then compare?
 blackburn	sonney2k: but for LLE I have to check something much more complex
 shogun-buildbot	build #77 of nightly_all is complete: Failure [failed compile]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_all/builds/77
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'm really sure with LLE, etc
@sonney2k	so you want to compute sth like objective value?
 blackburn	three algos I'm not sure with are NPE, LPP and LLTSA
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: my point is we should fix HMM and release
 blackburn	sonney2k: do not much worry about dimreduction things, I do a lot of development and testing still
 blackburn	and now everything looks ok
 blackburn	btw a little before it wasn't
@sonney2k	I am more worried about the dimred stuff than the hmm stuff :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: ehmm why?
 blackburn	sonney2k: I did tests on LLE, KLLE and both LTSA and KLTSA
 blackburn	on different data
 blackburn	and checked with scikits even
 blackburn	you underestimate too much
@sonney2k	no this is just experience - at some point any algorithm we have in shogun was correct and well tested but the bigger things get the harder it is to ensure that there are no side effects
 blackburn	it is much faster, flexible and accurate that it was in shogun 1.0
@sonney2k	so please do the test when you find the time - we can now but I am not too happy about it
 blackburn	sonney2k: test what?
 blackburn	sonney2k: do you want to hold release without tests?
@sonney2k	please do the tests for converter_* / dimred*
@sonney2k	no, as I said we can release now
 blackburn	sonney2k: but hmm??
@sonney2k	I will attempt to fix all tests except converter_* / dimred* first
@sonney2k	then
 blackburn	sonney2k: it can took more than 2 weeks
@sonney2k	could you please commit the modifyied tester.py?
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok
 blackburn	sonney2k: should it support different tolerances?
@sonney2k	yes, just as arg
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw numpy.all is bad pattern
 blackburn	there was near or so
@sonney2k	I only know any/all
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r380f6e2 / testsuite/python_modular/tester.py : Added tolerance option for tester - http://git.io/UcRuRw
@sonney2k	blackburn, I would rather use the relative deviation e.g. (a-b)/(a+b) < eps instead of norm
@sonney2k	anyway time to sleep
 blackburn	norm of (a-b)/(a+b)?
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r21324b9 / (3 files in 2 dirs): Faces application to dimreduction, added word embedding example - http://git.io/Hlu8CQ
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r51970aa / testsuite/python_modular/tester.py : Changed tolerance to max - http://git.io/M_3ezQ
 15SAAI18M	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r8108a74 / examples/undocumented/python_modular/converter_multidimensionalscaling_modular.py : Added testing info for MDS into python example - http://git.io/F_8Fyw
