 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: why? are you going to show them someone?
 sonne|osx	well I want the release out ASAP
 lisitsyn	ah
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: did you find the widget?
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: it is from here https://www.ohloh.net/p/shogun/widgets
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: and yes we need your cool dimred notebook :)
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: should be just copy & paste from what you submitted to jmlr
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: no, jmlr is just about implementations
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: I will do that once I get time :) I wish I did that instead of what I am doing now
 sonne|osx	but you had some nice figures and a tutorial style explanation no?
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: well on the website yes
 sonne|osx	well sure then use this
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: my job is taking too much time I would even think of changing it
 lisitsyn	that's the reason :)
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: I know what you mean. It is exhausting then.
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: we have a guy that keeps pushing new requirements and I barely have idea how to stop that :D
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: so you can go to that park now, right?
 sonne|osx	yes :)
 lisitsyn	with shutdown being over
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, I hadn't found it, thanks

@sonney2k	wiking, besser82  - any idea how to create some release snapshot tarball of the current source tree?
 besser82	sonney2k: git clone $github_url shogun-3.0.0-pre.tar && tar -cf shogun-3.0.0-pre.tar ./shogun-3.0.0-pre --exclude-vcs && bzip -9 shogun-3.0.0-pre.tar
 besser82	sonney2k: Sry, typo:   git clone $github_url shogun-3.0.0-pre && tar -cf shogun-3.0.0-pre.tar ./shogun-3.0.0-pre --exclude-vcs && bzip -9 shogun-3.0.0-pre.tar
@sonney2k	besser82, so there is no 'make dist' target in cmake or so?
@sonney2k	besser82, btw if you want to see some demos - the server is running now (still in unofficial debug mode where you have to paste urls though)
@sonney2k	http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org/
@sonney2k	besser82, ^
@sonney2k	then paste the urls it lists
 besser82	sonney2k: unfortunately, currently no make dist  :(
@sonney2k	e.g. http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org/application/language_detect/
@sonney2k	or http://fatbot.shogun-toolbox.org/regression/svr/
 besser82	sonney2k: will try  :)  How is it going with the google-bus?!?
@sonney2k	besser82, well most of the work done in the bus :)
 besser82	sonney2k: Did you already get "augenkrebs" from the bright & colourful leds inside?!?  XD
@sonney2k	besser82, :P
@sonney2k	I am hanging in some chair/bed like mixture here at googpleplex now
 besser82	sonney2k: sounds chilling  :D
@sonney2k	besser82, it is. some nice view to some virgin galactic spacecraft attempt
 besser82	sonney2k: Googleplex that's in Palo Alto isn't it?
@sonney2k	besser82, mountain view
 besser82	sonney2k:  nice as well  :D

@sonney2k	besser82, how did you exclude svmlight with this?
@sonney2k	besser82, and had a look at the applications?
@sonney2k	toy  / demos?
 besser82	sonney2k:  not yet ---> dealing with some fedora-business.
 besser82	sonney2k:  svmlight?  I usually build with "cmake -DUSE_SVMLIGHT=OFF"
@sonney2k	besser82, yes but I cannot even include the svmlight src code in the source tarball for debian
@sonney2k	besser82, so it needs to be stripped out even before
@sonney2k	besser82, and let me guess no reply from TJ?
 besser82	sonney2k:  no, even a single "no"  :(
 besser82	sonney2k:  no, not even a single "no".  :(
 besser82	sonney2k:  so you will need to find the svmlight-code in sources and purge it before....
 besser82	sonney2k:  we should use an alternative for `svmlight`.....
@sonney2k	let me dig out the old Makefile in main
 besser82	sonney2k:  or hijack it's code, obfuscate and release as gpl'ed lib  ;D
@sonney2k	besser82, you mean all code in one line right ;)
 besser82	sonney2k: sth. like that  ;)  But GPL'ed  XD
@sonney2k	besser82, --exclude-vcs stilli ncludes some .git dir?!
 besser82	sonney2k: usually not
 besser82	sonney2k: maybe .gitignore, but not more...
@sonney2k	besser82, .gitmodules was left in
 besser82	sonney2k: so tar seems to miss this, but that shouldn't get the tarball too oversize ;)
@sonney2k	ok have some minimal shell script that drops svmlight and creates some release tar

 lisitsyn	guys I'd drop that thing
 lisitsyn	if he keeps being such a bad guy we shouldn't advertise him anyhow
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: svmlight
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hei from HEIKO :D
 lisitsyn	why to keep it at all?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: HEI to HEIKO too!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well it has its benefits
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: if it is not opensource it doesn't exist ;)
