 sploving	hello all. git remote add https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sploving	git fetch upstream

 sploving	error: The requested URL returned error: 403
 sploving	what is the matter?
 blackburn	why do you want to add remote with shogun-toolbox/shogun?
 blackburn	ah I see
 blackburn	sploving: please paste git remote -v
 sploving	origin  git@github.com:sploving/shogun.git
 sploving	upstream        https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 blackburn	git remote rm upstream
 blackburn	git remote add upstream https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sploving	the same error
 sploving	have you test it?
 blackburn	blackburn@blackburn-laptop:~/shogun/shogun/src$ git remote -v

 blackburn	From https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun
 blackburn	 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 blackburn	works ok
 sploving	I do not know why. my origin git fetch upstream always stops there, like this: Receiving objects:  26% (259/995)
 sploving	I have to re git clone one
 sploving	git clone git clone git@github.com:sploving/shogun.git
 sploving	git git remote add upstream https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun.git
 sploving	eror, git remote add

 VojtechFranc	hi Alesis, are you here?
 alesis-novik	Hello VojtechFranc
 VojtechFranc	what is the progress?
 alesis-novik	I'm finishing up with the examples, though now I'll need to modify the Gaussian and GMM code to work with Shoguns new SGVector and SGMatrix
 alesis-novik	I had to do some travelling last week, so I didn't finish the examples. I've done the initial condition optimizations and sampling from the GMM
 VojtechFranc	have you submit the code to your GIT branch? Can I look at it?
 alesis-novik	Most of it is there, but I want to finish rewriting other bits before pushing the new things
 alesis-novik	I feel I'm bad at doing small patches. I keep making large chunks.
 VojtechFranc	however, submitting regularly allows to monitor your progrees
 VojtechFranc	btw, Soeren remined me that you are not sending your week progress reports.
 alesis-novik	I missed one because I couldn't send it on Saturday. I wanted to do the next one this Saturday to update on both weeks
 VojtechFranc	have you submitted any report so far?
 alesis-novik	I've been doing it every week until this one
 VojtechFranc	where do you send the mails? for some reasons I'm not getting them which, however, might be my fault
 alesis-novik	I'm sending them to the mailing list. I'll CC them to you from now on as well, if you're not getting any
-!- heiko1 [~heiko@134.91.10.201] has joined #shogun
 VojtechFranc	yes, please do it and also send me please the old ones.
 alesis-novik	Ok, though there won't be anything new in the old ones we haven't talked about.
 VojtechFranc	yes, still I need to keep track and later use them to write an assesment
 alesis-novik	So now that the basic-improved version of EM for GMM is working (I'll finish changing the code and push it tonight), I'd like to chat a bit about component merging and splitting.
 alesis-novik	I assume that's the next stem
 alesis-novik	s/stem/step
-!- heiko1 [~heiko@134.91.10.201] has quit [Client Quit]
 VojtechFranc	I'd like to play a bit with the basic-improved EM-GMM. I'd like to start with try it the examples you wrote/are writting
 VojtechFranc	when do you expect this part is finished so that I can compile and play
 VojtechFranc	?
 alesis-novik	Tomorrow
 VojtechFranc	ok, I look forward. Please send me an email when it is ready.
 alesis-novik	If somehow my Octave examples won't work, you said I could write Python ones, correct? (I had some trouble setting up octave)
 VojtechFranc	Python is OK
 VojtechFranc	actually, I forgot why you can use ordinary Matlab.
 alesis-novik	I can't use Matlab because I don't have Matlab on the computer I'm programming Shogun on.
 VojtechFranc	ok, I see.
 alesis-novik	I only use Matlab at the university, and I don't have admin access there
 VojtechFranc	why do you need admin access?
 alesis-novik	That and very limited space
 alesis-novik	Without admin I'd need to store everything in my allocated space, and I couldn't fit shogun + all dependencies there
 VojtechFranc	ok, no problem
 VojtechFranc	anyway, I'm looking forward to see tommorow the running examples and please don't forget to send me (all) progress reports. thanks
 alesis-novik	Will do
-!- in3xes_ is now known as in3xes
 VojtechFranc	thanks. cheers

 blackburn	alesis-novik: kinda strong mentoring :)
 alesis-novik	Hehe
 alesis-novik	blackburn, I had a question about the SGVector and SGMatrix
 blackburn	alesis-novik: shoot
 alesis-novik	We are now using them to pass parameters and as returned stuff(?). Should the internal fields be changed to SGVector and SGMatrix as well?
 blackburn	alesis-novik: not sure everywhere but if it will be consistent
 alesis-novik	Ok. I think it will make sense to use them to sa
 blackburn	alesis-novik: pros of using SG* is we can encapsulate sizes too
 alesis-novik	say store the covariance matrix
 alesis-novik	blackburn, yeah, it makes things a lot less messy
 blackburn	yes I guess it would be better - no need to have lots of size variables and so on
@sonney2k	spare time!
 blackburn	sonney2k: how are ya?
@sonney2k	blackburn, everyone is asleep now?
@sonney2k	!
 blackburn	nice :)
 blackburn	last exam in 8 hrs!
@sonney2k	blackburn, I wish you best of luck!
 blackburn	sonney2k: yesterday night I wrote some landmark MDS in python, it works just like classic MDS (very similar results) but e.g. took ~30s for 5000 vectors
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't talk to you about shogun things today - you have to learn for your exam.
 blackburn	sonney2k: not now, have some rest :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw some pull requests awaiting :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, you learn for your exam - break is over!
 blackburn	ahaha
 blackburn	daway daway rabotay? ;)
 serialhex	sonney2k: you here??
@sonney2k	serialhex, y
 serialhex	hey, so i figured out why my python wasn't working... it was installing to the wrong dir
 serialhex	if you go here: http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#how-installation-works it shows you where python stuff is to be installed, and if i had built python from source it would have been fine
@sonney2k	serialhex, hmmh ok
 serialhex	but b/c i didn't it shows up in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/shogun instead of /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/shogun/ (shogun default)
 serialhex	i'm looking through the src/config file right now for where to change this so it works everywhere, but i'm kind of lost :P (it's a big ass file!!!)
@sonney2k	f-x, around?
 serialhex	i think it's ~lines 1333 or so... but i'm not sure
@sonney2k	serialhex, it is weird - they started the dist-packages thing in python2.5 or 2.6 (annoying idea) and everything broke because of that
@sonney2k	now it is no longer dist-packages? hard to believe
 serialhex	idk about the dist-packages thing, but it's in /user/lib/python2.7 instead of /user/local/lib/python2.7
 serialhex	yeah, there is no dist-packages dir in my /usr/lib/python2.7 (not user XP )
 CIA-32	shogun: Shashwat Lal Das master * r096f05b / (145 files in 28 dirs): Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into streaming - http://bit.ly/jOIF7M
 CIA-32	shogun: Shashwat Lal Das master * r3565447 / (4 files): Made dynamic reallocation possible for features. size for parser is now in terms of ring size wrt number of examples. - http://bit.ly/miaho3
 CIA-32	shogun: Shashwat Lal Das master * rb85b3fa / (2 files): Switched to vlen nomenclature for SGVector objects instead of length in parser and ring code. - http://bit.ly/itdua7
@sonney2k	serialhex, I am afraid the only way to resolve this is to use --pydir as option to configure
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r045dc3a / src/configure : use whitespace in docu - http://bit.ly/mkAAyN
@sonney2k	f-x, please don't forget to rebase instead of merge'ing of upstream/master
@sonney2k	f-x, in your patch your code was the master and everything we did was considered the patch now
