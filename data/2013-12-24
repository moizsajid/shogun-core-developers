 bb	@wiking did you have issues using a editor and shogun was not being found
@wiking	noup
 sonne|osx	bb: it is either wrong PYTHONPATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
 bb	sonne|osx okay. how do you check that
 sonne|osx	bb: where did you install libshogun?
 sonne|osx	I mean you need to have 2 things
 bb	in the home directory /users/beenishb/shogun
 sonne|osx	one is the modshogun.so (that is loaded by python) and the libshogun - the lib where the ml algos are in
 sonne|osx	wiking: do we use rpath btw?
 sonne|osx	bb IIRC yes... so then only PYTHONPATH is not correctly set before you start the editor
 sonne|osx	wiking: what was that comment of yours a few days ago?!
 bb	sonne|osx that is strange i am using the same path in editor vs shell on mac
 bb	sonne|osx which is "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/"
 bb	sonne|osx let me check if i keep getting the same

 sonne|osx	bb: you can check by doing
 sonne|osx	import sys
 sonne|osx	sys.path
 sonne|osx	path should be in there
 sonne|osx	if not you could just sys.path.insert( ... )
 bb	yes it is in the path but the shell is not able to execute the script at from modshogun import * and hangs
 sonne|osx	bb: sounds like a clash between python versions then
 bb	sonne|osx can shogun be executed with any python or the version it was compiled with?
 sonne|osx	bb: only the one it was compiled w/
 bb	sonne|osx okay do you have any idea of how to change the version with which the python spyder is getting installed how to change that
 sonne|osx	bb:  no idea - maybe it takes what it finds in PATH?
 bb	sonne|osx okay i will check and try to debug
 bb	sonne|osx thanks for the pointer if i am not able to resolve it i will ping later

@iglesiasg	Happy Christmas Eve! :)
 besser82	iglesiasg, sonney2k, wiking, lisitsyn: merry x-mas to you (assuming you celebrate)  :D
 lisitsyn	merry christmas guys :)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm just curious: Which religion you belong to?  I mean you are from Russia, if I'm not mistaking, which has ~3 different types...
 lisitsyn	besser82: of course atheism ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: russia's default is orthodox christianity indeed
 besser82	lisitsyn: hehe
 lisitsyn	but I find it very silly to believe in stuff like that ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: yes, but there are some minority of jews, catholics, protestants and gregorian  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: I'm not that religious, too, but still believe there may be some "higher instance" of what kind ever
 lisitsyn	besser82: I believe xmas is kind of good tradition though ;)
 lisitsyn	santa ho-ho
 besser82	lisitsyn: Doesn't Santa come from Russia?
 lisitsyn	besser82: we have ded moroz
 lisitsyn	;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: When me kids asked me, I told them so  ;)
 besser82	lisitsyn: Wasn't there a few hundred years ago someone called "St. Nikolas" living in Russia?
 besser82	lisitsyn: Who's life and work basically framed that Santa-Story?
 lisitsyn	besser82: yeah probably it is ;)
 lisitsyn	besser82: I don't know about origins of that story to be honest
 lisitsyn	it sounds quite similar to jesus which could not have existed at all :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: AFAIK there was some "St. Nikolas" in Russia, who helped the poor people by selling the belongings of the curch to buy stuff the really need in hard winter
 besser82	lisitsyn: like blankets, food, charcoal
 lisitsyn	I see!
 besser82	lisitsyn: and gave it to them
 besser82	lisitsyn: and that's a proven fact.  And most people think that fact is the origin of that Santa-Story
 lisitsyn	besser82: weeeellll proven ;)
 lisitsyn	people like changing history
 lisitsyn	besser82: e.g. see 'commisar vanishes' book :)
 lisitsyn	I can send you pdf if that works for you
 besser82	lisitsyn: sure  :D
 besser82	lisitsyn: just mail out that pdf  besser82@fedoraproject.org
 lisitsyn	besser82: I just realized I have russian copy
 lisitsyn	:D
 lisitsyn	oh well let you check pictures
 lisitsyn	besser82: it is about vanished people during stalin's period
 lisitsyn	besser82: they removed anyone killed from photos :D
 besser82	lisitsyn:  hehe, i can read pictures, if they aren't drawn in cyrillic  :-P
 besser82	lisitsyn:  heard about that
 lisitsyn	besser82: check ya mail ;)

 besser82	lisitsyn:  Looks really interesting.  I think, I should look out for the english printing
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, ping
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: hey!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: how did your thing go?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think it went well actually!
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, but I got no news yet, so I am waiting
 lisitsyn	I see
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I did it pretty much in the same way as in the YouTube video :)
@iglesiasg	just a bit faster, I guess I wanted to speed it up and finish asap hehe
 lisitsyn	hehe I see
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I think I have found an issue, wanted to ask if you faced it before
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, related to CFeatures::duplicate
@iglesiasg	DenseFeatures implements it using copy constructor
@iglesiasg	and this couses that the ref count is copied as well
@iglesiasg	but I think that this can be undesirable in some cases
@iglesiasg	like you want to get a copy of the features with duplicate and the ref count reset
@iglesiasg	gtg now, see you later, and enjoy Christmas!
