 blackburn	sonney2k: I have one critical issue
 blackburn	if some lapack wrappers are called from threads - there will be race conditions with mallocs..
@sonney2k	blackburn, ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: in lapack wrappers work arrays are being allocated
@sonney2k	you mean in the wrapper there are mallocs?
 blackburn	yeys
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	but what is the problem?
 blackburn	there are race conditions
@sonney2k	you mean in the wrappers there are race conditions?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	then you need spinlocks again?
 blackburn	cause wrap functions are being called from different threads
 blackburn	no, I guess I would better do it more low-level
 blackburn	in my converters
@sonney2k	but that is more high level?
 blackburn	hmm well that's strange
@sonney2k	blackburn, anyway wrt arpack/blas/lapack - we need to make sure that examples don't need to be linked against these libs
 blackburn	sonney2k: what about arpack example?
 blackburn	ah well it shouldn't too
 blackburn	sonney2k: are you getting no free time last days?
@sonney2k	busy times indeed...
