@sonney2k	f-x`, are you around?
 f-x`	sonney2k: yes
-!- f-x [~user@117.192.214.159] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	f-x`/f-x, I just wanted to ask whether you think your submitted code is in releasable state
@sonney2k	or what you still want to improve
@sonney2k	as you might know we currently intend to release on aug 31
 f-x`	sonney2k: it depends on what feature is being used
 f-x	i.e. StreamingSimpleFeatures etc will mostly be good
@sonney2k	f-x, ok and which are not so?
 f-x`	but there are others which I'll be happier if I work on before releasing
 f-x	sonney2k: eg. StreamingStringFeatures is something I want to experiment on further
@sonney2k	f-x, is it doable for you to finish the tests within the next few days?\
 f-x`	VW is good, one minor addition I can think of will make it good enough
@sonney2k	f-x, you can always improve
@sonney2k	this won't be the last release of shogun
 f-x`	sonney2k: yes, i think i can do it if i work on the testing part now
@sonney2k	however it would be great if we could release sth rather now/soon and then gradually continue development
@sonney2k	so better fix/test now and mark things unstable if you are not convinced that they work
@sonney2k	the shogun-buildbot is doing a great job in helping us detect regressions...
 f-x`	sonney2k: ok, i'll concentrate on getting the *Features things working in a more stable manner first
 f-x	one features class per day should mean all 3 covered in the next 3 days, which is hopefully okay
@sonney2k	yes ok
@sonney2k	it is best if you write some small (python_modular) test script for them
@sonney2k	then these will always be tested
 f-x`	sonney2k: could you point me to some similar scripts for the features classes we already have?
@sonney2k	f-x, just look at the python_modular/feature*.py examples
 f-x`	ok, will do

@sonney2k	f-x, thank you very much!
 f-x	sonney2k: np, will look to get it done as soon as possible
@sonney2k	lets make this the best shogun release ever :D
 f-x	yay! :)

 blackburn	sonney2k: so did you manage to fix java compilation? it works for me btw
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes - there were some things just not installed
@sonney2k	on the buildslave I mean
@sonney2k	blackburn, but look at http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/java_modular/builds/99/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	still lots of errors...
@sonney2k	though some of them seem to be easiliy solved
@sonney2k	like
@sonney2k	================================================================================
@sonney2k	 error in classifier_liblinear_modular.java
@sonney2k	================================================================================
@sonney2k	Unable to create matrix from .../data/fm_train_real.dat: .../data/fm_train_real.dat (No such file or directory)
@sonney2k	or should I say .........../data/ *lol*
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw csharp works more or less too now but also has issues running the examples
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	I'll fix java soon
@sonney2k	though I need sploving's help
 blackburn	he disappeared :D
@sonney2k	I hope he will do the fixes
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you know if serialhex has time to fix all the ruby examples?
 blackburn	no idea
@sonney2k	the build now also works but many new tests fail
@sonney2k	the ones that are just not yet ported for real
@sonney2k	in the worst case we have to do it all...
@sonney2k	or remove non-working examples when we run out of time
 CIA-87	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r4a4d755 / src/interfaces/modular/modshogun_ignores.i : turn on ignores again as the culprit was broken java detection in configure - http://git.io/PEnKsA
 blackburn	sonney2k: uh.. found bug
 blackburn	it seems that if some getter is called and result isn't 'saved' anywhere - it leads to memory error
 blackburn	in java
@sonney2k	result isn't saved - what does that mean?
@sonney2k	f-x, please fix the if thing
@sonney2k	and then I commit
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean a shogun object
@sonney2k	or double[,] ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: double matrix
 blackburn	i.e. get_histogram()
@sonney2k	blackburn, please be more verbose
 f-x	sonney2k: ah, i see - no if () needed before any SG_UNREF?
@sonney2k	I still don't understand
@sonney2k	f-x, SG_UNREF checks that already
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah I overvodkaed
 blackburn	I will check before
@sonney2k	blackburn, it is more like you chat while riding on you bear
 blackburn	sonney2k: checked, I was wrong
 blackburn	orr
 f-x	sonney2k: ok, done
 blackburn	histogram bug I guess

 f-x	)
 f-x	some more coming up soon
 blackburn	for (i=0; i< (int32_t) (1<<16); i++)
 blackburn	hist[i]=0;
 blackburn	WTF?!
 blackburn	uh
 blackburn	okay not a bug
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	sonney2k: histogram get_histogram fails in java..
 blackburn	no idea why
 blackburn	sonney2k: STACK OVERFLOW!
@sonney2k	blackburn, uhh
@sonney2k	how that and where
 blackburn	get_histogram returns vector of size 65536
 blackburn	so distribution_histogram_modular fails
@sonney2k	so?
@sonney2k	but the vector is not on stack?!
 blackburn	looks like it is
@sonney2k	blackburn, you talk about SGVector ?
 blackburn	yes, SGVector mapped to DoubleMatrix
@sonney2k	but SGVector is just a double* and int
@sonney2k	not sure about the java typemap mapping
 blackburn	I tried return just 40k of histogram elements
 blackburn	and got stack overflow
 blackburn	if it is 65536 all is fucked up with SIGSERV
 blackburn	sonney2k: JNITYPE arr[cols]
@sonney2k	blackburn, indeed loock at swig_typemaps.i line 113
 blackburn	FUCK
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	so please do a SG_MALLOC there
 blackburn	*** sploving
@sonney2k	blackburn, same thing will happen in SGMatrix
 blackburn	STACK MEMORY ALLOCATION
 blackburn	sonney2k: get_degree defined two times in SpectrumMismatchRBFKernel :D
 blackburn	:D

@sonney2k	blackburn, btw now we have to check that this is not causing a memory leak
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, shouldn't
 blackburn	sonney2k: java would crash with some MTHFCKR SIGNAL :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, I mean you might have to call SG_FREE later...
@sonney2k	blackburn, so do all java examples work now?
@sonney2k	blackburn, wait you have a copy'n'paste bug here
@sonney2k	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/63b5aec58bf1f8b1cb6d13cfd3db975596133d1e
@sonney2k	line 480
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, not all
 blackburn	in progress
 blackburn	sonney2k: but where to call SG_FREE??
@sonney2k	after the JNI_CALL thing?
 blackburn	will it copy array?
@sonney2k	I don't know
 blackburn	me too
 blackburn	sonney2k: looks like no
 blackburn	it uses some Set[Type]ArrayRegion
@sonney2k	http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/jni/spec/functions.html
@sonney2k	Set<PrimitiveType>ArrayRegion Routines
@sonney2k	it only copies
@sonney2k	so we have to SG_FREE
 blackburn	okay

 sploving1	sonney2k, are you around?
@sonney2k	sploving1, yes
 sploving1	hist[0]=92 what do you mean
 sploving1	I did not understand it clearly
@sonney2k	a histogram is computed over the characters in the string
@sonney2k	that says that the string null termination character appeared 92 times
@sonney2k	(I think you have 92 strings there)
 sploving1	what does get_num_bits_in_histogram()=3  mean?
@sonney2k	that one would need 3 bits to encode the 5 different characters
@sonney2k	but DNA has only 4 characters - 2bits needed so that won't fit
 sploving1	 even though a DNA alphabet was expected so only ord('A') (C/G/T) should
 sploving1	appear?
 sploving1	DNA?
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	A,C,G,T
@sonney2k	but you have a '\0' in the string
 sploving1	you mean ACGT'\0'
@sonney2k	I guess that you pass a string 1 byte too long
@sonney2k	no
 sploving1	sonney2k, in C we have '\0' in the string
@sonney2k	ACATCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTACGTACGTATCGTAGCTGTACG\0
@sonney2k	sploving1, in shogun not
@sonney2k	never
@sonney2k	we have a ptr and a length
 sploving1	the length is not include the '\0', so I add 1 in the typemap
@sonney2k	so one fix would be to just say str.length = len-1
 sploving1	str.length mean shogun length, len means C length, am I right?
@sonney2k	that is the problem then
@sonney2k	yes len means csharp len
 sploving1	max_len = shogun::CMath::max(len, max_len); strings[i].slen = len + 1;
 sploving1	maybe this is where is the but
 sploving1	bug
 sploving1	max_len = shogun::CMath::max(len, max_len); strings[i].slen = len;
 sploving1	am I right?
@sonney2k	could be
@sonney2k	likely yes
 sploving1	I will have a try
@sonney2k	sploving1, OK - when that is done could you please have a look at the gaussian kernel example? it doesn't return the correct results (looks more like uninited memory...)
 sploving1	okay. I saw your email. but have no idea about that now
 sploving1	why the other examples work well
 sploving1	but gaussian_kernel not work well
@sonney2k	sploving1, the linear kernel one also crashes
@sonney2k	seems to be the same problem
 sploving1	fixed the stringlist but and pushed

 CIA-87	shogun: fix stringlist bug - http://git.io/zVJFYQ
@sonney2k	sploving1, thanks
 sploving1	I need a simple example to test the matrix
@sonney2k	sploving1, the gaussian kernel one
 sploving1	when I output the gaussian_kernel, it prints a lot of numbers
 sploving1	I did not even know which is in the triangle
 sploving1	linear is easier?
 sploving1	not at all
 sploving1	foreach(double item in km_train) {
 sploving1	Console.Write(item);
 sploving1	}
 sploving1	maybe I just printf the first line
 sploving1	the first element should be 1, am I right?
@sonney2k	sploving1, linear crashes here
 sploving1	linear_word?
@sonney2k	why not use kernel_gaussian_modular.cs?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	you can simplify gaussian if you want
@sonney2k	just use
 sploving1	I think kernel_gaussian_modular.cs is easy
 sploving1	why you say k[i,i]=1
@sonney2k	        GaussianKernel kernel = new GaussianKernel(feats_train, feats_train, width);
@sonney2k	        double[,] km_train = kernel.get_kernel_matrix();
 sploving1	this is shogun inner issue?
@sonney2k	then km_train[i,i] should be 1.0
@sonney2k	sploving1, by definition of the gaussian kernel
@sonney2k	exp(0) == 1
 sploving1	you mean Console.Write(km_train[0,0])  should be 1
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	i,i I would use though
@sonney2k	but yes
@sonney2k	km_train[0,0] should be 1 too :)
 sploving1	km_train[0,0]  is 1 here
 sploving1	I will test km_train[1,1]
 sploving1	sonney2k, in my machine it is 1
* sonney2k checks again
 sploving1	I test a random number km_train[8,8]
 sploving1	it print 1
@sonney2k	sploving1, uhh it could be a printing problem
@sonney2k	because there are no spaces between numbers
 sploving1	yeap
 sploving1	I am not very familiar with Csharp
 sploving1	another issue, is linear_word??
@sonney2k	sploving1, yeah but if you replace GaussianKernel in the example with LinearKernel - it already fails
@sonney2k	(remove width parameter)
 sploving1	LinearKernel is different from gaussian kernel
 sploving1	LinearKernel kernel = new LinearKernel(feats_train, feats_test);
@sonney2k	yes
 sploving1	not LinearKernel kernel = new LinearKernel(feats_train, feats_train)
@sonney2k	err feats_train, feats_train
@sonney2k	then feats_train, feats_test
@sonney2k	will be two different matrices at the end
@sonney2k	hmmhh just changing this in the gaussian_modular example didn't cause any trouble
 sploving1	then what do you mean fails?
@sonney2k	kernel_linear_word_modular.cs
 sploving1	what is the output?
 sploving1	it works in my machine
 sploving1	I just run it
@sonney2k	 error in kernel_linear_word_modular.cs

 sploving1	here it print out the above numbers
@sonney2k	hmmhh
 sploving1	maybe others can help have a try
@sonney2k	sploving1, how many cores do you have?
 sploving1	2 core
@sonney2k	me too
 sploving1	i5
@sonney2k	core2 duo
 sploving1	I think others can help have a try
@sonney2k	sploving1, it is also crashing on the build bot
@sonney2k	http://shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/csharp_modular/builds/103/steps/test_1/logs/stdio
 sploving1	how to run build bot?
 sploving1	buid bot is ??
@sonney2k	sploving1, as soon as you commit sth, it compiles everything and checks the examples
@sonney2k	sploving1, 64bit machine or 32bit?
 sploving1	sonney2k, can I run it in my machine?
@sonney2k	yours I mean?
 sploving1	you mean OS?
@sonney2k	I think the out typemap is broken
 sploving1	32
@sonney2k	buildbot and my notebook here are 64bit
@sonney2k	so I guess that is the reason then
* sonney2k checks the out typemap for SGMatrix
 sploving1	soney2k, buildbot is another machine? super machine?
 sploving1	I am so interested in it
@sonney2k	sploving1, look at line 130
@sonney2k	in swig_typemaps.i
 sploving1	res[i + 2] = (CTYPE) $1.matrix[i];
 sploving1	??
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	I mean what is CTYPE?
@sonney2k	sth like int?
@sonney2k	you then first assign res[0]  / res[1] with some lengths (integers)
@sonney2k	and then res[i+2] with the ptr to data I guess?
@sonney2k	on my machine ptrs will be 64 bit I think so this could be the reason
 sploving1	int, long, float, double, short are all CTYPE
@sonney2k	sploving1, buildbot is some core i7 2600 w/ 16G memory just building shogun all the time
 sploving1	just a core? not a machine / notebook with disk?
@sonney2k	intel core i7
@sonney2k	the processor
@sonney2k	just some machine
@sonney2k	desktop
 sploving1	oh. I know, you just named a popular machine, which is running the shogun always
 sploving1	are there any way we can run shogun in irc?
@sonney2k	shogun-buildbot, dance
 sploving1	I saw lua irc can run lua command
 shogun-buildbot	<(^.^<)
 shogun-buildbot	<(^.^)>

 sploving1	great
@sonney2k	sploving1, back to the SGMatrix out typemap
@sonney2k	can't you use the struct SGMatrix has?
@sonney2k	and then in the csout typemap just use the respective ptrs
 sploving1	?
 sploving1	not understand
@sonney2k	sploving1, what you did doesn't work
@sonney2k	you allocate an array of e.g. uint16_t
@sonney2k	and then assign rows / cols in elements 0/1
@sonney2k	and the data ptr to index 2
 sploving1	yeap
@sonney2k	now when e.g. rows is bigger than 65536 rows etc won't fit in that datatype
@sonney2k	nor the 32bit (in your case) or 64bit data ptr
@sonney2k	so why not use the SGMatrix struct directly?
 sploving1	no
 sploving1	%typemap(imtype, out="IntPtr", inattributes="int rows, int cols, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray)]") shogun::SGMatrix<SGTYPE>%{CSHARPTYPE[,]%}
 sploving1	in Csharp, we cannot know rows and cols
 sploving1	so I mange the typemap to add two args, rows and cols
@sonney2k	is the LPArray a ptr to the array?
@sonney2k	adding these two args is fine - but you need a big enough buffer to hold them
 sploving1	yeap
@sonney2k	so CTYPE cannot work

@sonney2k	you need sth that is 2*size(int32_t)+size(void*) big and then assign sizes to the respective elements
@sonney2k	actually it is not a ptr
@sonney2k	so sizeof(CTYPE)*num_rows*num_cols + 2*sizeof(int32_t)
@sonney2k	sploving1, do you agree?
 sploving1	let me think
 sploving1	yeap
 f-x	sonney2k: do you think it is ok if i typedef something like vw_size_t to uint32_t and use it in place of size_t in vw?
@sonney2k	sploving1, any idea how to properly fix it?
 shogun-buildbot	build #118 of r_static is complete: Failure [failed test test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/r_static/builds/118  blamelist: sploving1@gmail.com
 sploving1	sonney2k, how to use SG_MALLOC to malloc a two int and len*sizeof(CTYPE)
@sonney2k	f-x, sure
 f-x	sonney2k: ok, i'll see how that works out
@sonney2k	f-x, but why not uint32_t directly (or whaever was meant?)
@sonney2k	sploving1, only possilbe with hacks
 f-x	sonney2k: i feel something like *size_t would explain the meaning better
 f-x	if we convert it to uint32_t we lose out on some info about the intended use of the variable
@sonney2k	f-x, ok
@sonney2k	sploving1, that is why I suggested a struc
@sonney2k	sploving1, you could use
@sonney2k	char* res = SG_MALLOC(char, sizeof(CTYPE)*len + 2*sizeof(int32_t));
@sonney2k	    ((int32_t*) res)[0] = rows;
@sonney2k	    ((int32_t*) res)[1] = cols;
@sonney2k	    CTYPE* dst = (CTYPE*) (res+2*sizeof(int32_t));
@sonney2k	    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
@sonney2k	        dst[i + 2] = (CTYPE) $1.matrix[i];
@sonney2k	    }
@sonney2k	or so
@sonney2k	it seems $result is a CTYPE* though
@sonney2k	so you might have to cast that again
@sonney2k	and then when you marshal do the same (un)mangling
 sploving1	sonney, souds right. but dst is no need. res[i+2] is OK
@sonney2k	no res[i+2] is not
@sonney2k	if we have
@sonney2k	char* res;
@sonney2k	then res[i+2] would be the 3rd byte
@sonney2k	and only one byte for rows/cols
 sploving1	CTYPE* dst = (CTYPE*) (res+2*sizeof(int32_t)); why?
 sploving1	CTYPE* dst = (CTYPE*) res
 sploving1	is oK
 sploving1	then we use des[i+2]
@sonney2k	sploving1, rows and cols are always integers - correct?
@sonney2k	so they are 4 bytes always no matter what CTYPE we use - right?
 sploving1	yepa
 sploving1	yeap
 sploving1	you mean another way?
@sonney2k	so when CTYPE==int or then dst[i+2] would point at byte 9 - which is correct
@sonney2k	but when CTYPE==char then dst[i+2] points to byte 3 - > kaboom
@sonney2k	do you see the problem?
 sploving1	i know, then it should be  dst[i] = (CTYPE) $1.matrix[i];
 sploving1	not dst[i + 2] = (CTYPE) $1.matrix[i];
 sploving1	I think
@sonney2k	?!
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	don't you want to marshal the following sequence:
@sonney2k	int,int, CTYPE[some_size]
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	ahh dst[i] yes not res[i+2]

 sploving1	what is the matter?
@sonney2k	sploving1, it is crashing because of the wrong assignments / array sizes
@sonney2k	sploving1, just create a ByteFeatures example and you will see also on your machine
 sploving1	maybe there is something missing
 sploving1	when I use len instead of len+1
 sploving1	sonney2k,  cannot convert 'char*' to 'double*' in assignment
@sonney2k	?
 sploving1	can I use void * res = SG_MALLOC(char, sizeof(CTYPE) * len + 2 * sizeof(int32_t));
 sploving1	instead of char *
@sonney2k	sploving1, you can also cast at the end
 sploving1	when I use CTYPE *r = (CTYPE *)res;  it means doulbe * r = (double*) res
 sploving1	cannot work
 sploving1	as res is char*
@sonney2k	serialhex, but you can use $result = (CTYPE*) res;
@sonney2k	sploving, but you can use $result = (CTYPE*) res;
@sonney2k	however you need to make sure that the marshaling is ok
@sonney2k	because it is in fact not a (CTYPE*) but some *whatever*
 sploving1	$rest is not double*
 sploving1	$result is not doulbe *
 sploving1	$result can use any cast, you mean
@sonney2k	what is result?
@sonney2k	(CTYPE*) yes
@sonney2k	sploving1, but you also need to adjust the csout typemap
 sploving1	I know that

@sonney2k	blackburn, line?
 blackburn	367
 blackburn	or 368 now
@sonney2k	blackburn, why is work a double* ?
@sonney2k	but lwork an int?
 blackburn	LWORK   (input) INTEGER
 blackburn	sonney2k: LWORK is a length of WORK
@sonney2k	lwork = (int)work[0];
@sonney2k	but that converts the double to an int
 blackburn	sonney2k: on the first call it determines the optimal work size
 blackburn	and stores it in work(1)
 blackburn	or work[0]
@sonney2k	sure about that?
 blackburn	WORK    (workspace/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)) *          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
@sonney2k	ok but then that is the error
 blackburn	20th argument is wrong
@sonney2k	you need to do lwork = *((int*) work);
 blackburn	try that
 blackburn	sonney2k: so why lwork = *((int*) work)? any difference?
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes it works now
@sonney2k	(my machine is not that fast...)

@sonney2k	blackburn, I hope you understand what the error was
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	:D
@sonney2k	then better try hard
@sonney2k	it is important
@sonney2k	you have double* work;
@sonney2k	so what will work[0] give you ?
 blackburn	first double element
@sonney2k	and then when you do (int) of it?
 blackburn	oh
@sonney2k	int of the *double* element
 blackburn	I got work[2]
 blackburn	in means of integer array
@sonney2k	int of the first 64bit double
 blackburn	yeah I see
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	so the fix is clear now?
 blackburn	yeah seems so
@sonney2k	ok good
@sonney2k	I had a long chat session with baozeng today about some csharp marshalling and the errors he made were very similar
 blackburn	oh it was hard I guess :D
@sonney2k	read the logs
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r0fcedaa / examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/all_evaluation.py : remove all_evaluation - http://git.io/nV_eyQ
@sonney2k	aha
@sonney2k	hemisphere data is gone again
@sonney2k	could it be that you didn't commit data?
@sonney2k	blackburn, in the shogun repository?
@sonney2k	I mean like git commit data ?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah may be
@sonney2k	please do so
@sonney2k	then I can git submodule update
 shogun-buildbot	build #114 of csharp_modular is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/csharp_modular/builds/114
@sonney2k	yeaaaaahhhh!
@sonney2k	only ruby and java left
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * rf1cc27a / data : Data update - http://git.io/HJztAw
 blackburn	sonney2k: should be ok now
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes indeed
@sonney2k	I don't get the example to work though
 blackburn	which example?
@sonney2k	hemisphere
@sonney2k	when commenting the 3d stuff
@sonney2k	I still have
@sonney2k	    swiss_roll_fig.scatter(X[0], X[1], X[2], s=10, c=tt, cmap=plt.cm.Spectral)
@sonney2k	TypeError: scatter() got multiple values for keyword argument 's'
@sonney2k	so I guess it needs a new matplotlib
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes it is 3d scatter
 blackburn	comment it out
 blackburn	sonney2k: not really there is a way to do that for your matplotlib
 blackburn	I don't remember how
@sonney2k	blackburn, would be cool if you could do a try: except: around this
@sonney2k	such that not all figures fail
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, it is possible to do that even in old matplotlib
@sonney2k	shh ok
@sonney2k	ahh ok
@sonney2k	:)
 blackburn	but I need to fix things in lapack
@sonney2k	so we now have to fix 2 graphical examples
@sonney2k	4 java bugs
@sonney2k	your lapack issue (basically resolved)
@sonney2k	and the ruby examples
@sonney2k	then everything works \o/
 blackburn	sonney2k: I should add lapack test for libshogun
 blackburn	like I did for arpack
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	I don't understand?
@sonney2k	you mean some mathemetics_lapack.cpp ?
 blackburn	mathematics_arpack.cpp
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: now it fails on my machine?!
@sonney2k	blackburn, where?
 blackburn	lapack issue
@sonney2k	yeah but not in the same line right?
 blackburn	same..
@sonney2k	show me the code please
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	dsyevr
 blackburn	i did
 blackburn	lwork = *((int*)work);
 blackburn	sonney2k: but works in the old way
 blackburn	probably better to use double work1 variable
 blackburn	like you did in dsyev
@sonney2k	but my code is wrong too
 blackburn	sonney2k: ?!
@sonney2k	the (int) work1;
@sonney2k	it has the same problem
 blackburn	not possible
@sonney2k	blackburn, could you please print out the returned integers?
 blackburn	where?
 blackburn	dsygvx?
@sonney2k	in dsyevr / dsyev
@sonney2k	once with the (int*) thing and once with the int(work1)
 blackburn	better dsygvx
 blackburn	DSYGVX lwork=21500
 blackburn	21500 for WORKAROUND ARRAY? :D
@sonney2k	sounds good
@sonney2k	what else?
@sonney2k	temp buffer
@sonney2k	not workaround
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	but larger than I thought
 blackburn	it is bigger than matrices..
 blackburn	ah no
 blackburn	noon
 blackburn	i'm crazy
 blackburn	sonney2k: if I use *((int*)work) I got 0
@sonney2k	ok so that is obviously not the intended value
@sonney2k	btw I find
@sonney2k	http://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/mkl/lapack/mkl_lapack_examples/dsyev_ex.c.htm
@sonney2k	they also use (int) work1;
 blackburn	I will try with work1
-!- f-x` [~user@117.192.216.242] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@sonney2k	blackburn, but that is the same...
@sonney2k	hmmhhh
 blackburn	no it is not
 blackburn	:D
 CIA-3	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r139c42a / src/shogun/mathematics/lapack.cpp : Attempt to fix DSYGVX - http://git.io/yfZRpg
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please update and try?
@sonney2k	works
 blackburn	okay so it should be the common way
@sonney2k	blackburn, now I see what you did wrong: you called SG_FREE and then accessed the content of work[0
@sonney2k	]
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	bad
@sonney2k	 SG_FREE(work);
@sonney2k	367 
@sonney2k	-  lwork = (int)work[0];
 blackburn	okay it is better anyway
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok now please continue with java - if you happen to get in touch with serialhex ask him for rub rub ruby :)
 blackburn	okay
@sonney2k	my ruby is not good enough - I have a couple of Q's
 blackburn	we should call him as russian kids call ??????????
 blackburn	i'm not sure you know wtf it is

 blackburn	installed old matplotlib
@sonney2k	did you punish you bear
@sonney2k	ahh
 shogun-buildbot	build #136 of cmdline_static is complete: Failure [failed test_1]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/cmdline_static/builds/136  blamelist: blackburn91@gmail.com
 blackburn	sonney2k: the problem is I can't combine 3d and 2d plots in matplotlib 0.99..
 blackburn	ah wrong
 blackburn	not
 blackburn	what the f I'm saying
 shogun-buildbot	build #137 of cmdline_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org:5347/builders/cmdline_static/builds/137
 blackburn	uh it is hard to combine versions heh
 blackburn	sonney2k: GOT IT
 blackburn	should work now..

 blackburn	sonney2k: could you please try?
@sonney2k	it opens 2 figures
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	nice
 blackburn	sonney2k: unfortunately I can't combine 3d and 2d so for 0.99 - with two figures only
 blackburn	on >1.0 it would work better
