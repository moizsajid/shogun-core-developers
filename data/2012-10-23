@sonney2k	blackburn, I just recruited 2 mentors for next year :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: ha! who?
@sonney2k	someone from google and someone who was in tuebingen but is now in CA
@sonney2k	both excellent researchers
 blackburn	secret names? :)
@sonney2k	quoc and olivier :D
@sonney2k	they wanted to recruit me but I won :P
 blackburn	recruit to?
@sonney2k	g
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw I think we should have some acknowlegdements on the shogun homepage
@sonney2k	and then thank all the authors/projects we stole code from
@sonney2k	like we have in our contributions file
 blackburn	yeah but it is pretty hard to not lost track
@sonney2k	I know but still
 blackburn	sonney2k: that was kinda embarrassing to get that mail, I feel guilty
@sonney2k	blackburn, you should :(
@sonney2k	blackburn, do the acknowlegdement / contributions page on the website and send these guys an additional sorry email
@sonney2k	that can really cause trouble
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay added have to fill it now
 blackburn	sonney2k: LibSVM, LibLinear, SLEP, MALSAR, LaRank, GPBT, LibOCAS, SVMLin, SGDSVM, VW
 blackburn	anything else?
 blackburn	sonney2k: http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/about/contributions
 blackburn	sonney2k: okay another sorry message
 blackburn	I next one I should include some kitten photos

 wiking	blackburn: ping
 blackburn	wiking: pong
 wiking	blackburn: i think we could get a dataset from uricamic for so svm
 blackburn	which?
 blackburn	and what for  :)
 wiking	minst char recognition
 wiking	and for the pylab
 blackburn	I do not really understand how it is a SO
 blackburn	what is structured out there?
 wiking	1-9 char
 blackburn	it is just multiclass I'd say
 wiking	yes
 wiking	but i think i could create an latent-sosvm dataset as well
 wiking	i'll try to do this till friday
 wiking	does it have to work via python? :)
 wiking	mmm new git
 wiking	blackburn: btw when to define director classes for swig?
 blackburn	wiking: what do you mean 'when'?
 wiking	blackburn: well i've tried to figure out what is at all director class
 wiking	from swig doc
 blackburn	ahh
 blackburn	so when is like what is the case
 blackburn	okay
 blackburn	the case is:
 wiking	yeah
 blackburn	you want to train a model
 blackburn	structured model using risk that is
 blackburn	but you are totally lazy to write C++ risk function
 blackburn	so you inherit from DirectorRisk or how it is called
 blackburn	and implement risk function out there
 wiking	inherit in python you mean?
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	and implement in python as well
 wiking	so basically if i have latentmodel
 blackburn	then you just plug it in
 wiking	that is totally abstract
 blackburn	and voila
 wiking	and i want to support that u can implement it in python
 wiking	i need to provide a director class for it?
 wiking	right?
 blackburn	well you'd need to mark it as director in swig interfaces file, right
 wiking	ok
 blackburn	and you'd need to declare *ALL* virtual methods from upper classes
 wiking	yeah i see that
 wiking	there's a directorstructuremodel.h
 blackburn	yes
 wiking	btw: i hate nerdtree
 wiking	anything better than that?
 blackburn	I do not use it
 blackburn	I remember all paths
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	lolface
 blackburn	wiking: there is an example
 blackburn	examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/
 blackburn	something with word director dot py
 blackburn	there is a multiclass model wrote using python
 wiking	examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py
 wiking	i guess
 blackburn	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/master/examples/undocumented/python_modular/graphical/so_multiclass_director_BMRM.py
 wiking	ok cool
 wiking	yeah
 wiking	i'll then create the director class for latent
 wiking	i have to give some extra options for ./configure to support director classes
 wiking	or that's automagically detected
 wiking	whether i support or not
 wiking	btw: if i dont define a function in a director class then i won't be able to override that function in the target language?
 wiking	like i have a function in LatentModel that is virtual but not pure virtual
 blackburn	wiking: no, you'd have to explicitly define it still
 blackburn	and call base class' method
 blackburn	unfortunately
 blackburn	in other way you will got infinite recursion
 wiking	okok
 wiking	got it
 wiking	blackburn: will it use the default implementation though if it's not redefined?
 blackburn	I am not sure but we did it explicitly
 blackburn	IIRC it worked only that way.

 heiko1	sonney2k, blackburn, just got a job offer :)
 blackburn	heiko1: nice, where?
 heiko1	blackburn, at uni, with the statistics department
 blackburn	ahh
 heiko1	only a little 6-month project, but ...
 blackburn	is it what you wanted?
 heiko1	the cool thing is: I will be implementing things into shogun for that
 blackburn	oh so we've got shogun employee
 heiko1	yeah kind of, to bridge a gap between now and phd start
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	nice
 heiko1	GP-classification
 heiko1	so an extension to jacobs work
 wiking	:>
 wiking	congratz heiko1
 heiko1	thanks, wiking :)
 blackburn	and I am still waiting for decision :D
 heiko1	fingers crossed!
 n4nd0	yeah, congrats heiko :)
 wiking	n4nd0: i have a new so solver
 wiking	based on mosek
 wiking	but i don't know
 n4nd0	wiking: I read sth about that yesterday night
 wiking	i thnk we should talk about your mosek wrapper
 wiking	can u check it out some time?
 n4nd0	yes
 wiking	nowish?
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	not really :S
 wiking	hehe ok
 n4nd0	I have to go in a few minutes
 wiking	i'll send u the code in email?
 wiking	is that good?
 n4nd0	but just tell me, what would you like to do with the mosek wrapper?
 n4nd0	wiking: yeah sure, send it
 wiking	n4nd0: check out the code
 wiking	and then we'll talk
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	wiking: give me also a clue of wthat is the code doing if you think it is a bit hard to understand from only the code
 wiking	n4nd0: ok
 n4nd0	ok gtg now
 n4nd0	tty later

 blackburn	wiking: specialization?
 wiking	ye
 wiking	so that we use optimized version of that stuff
 wiking	if available
 blackburn	is there real impact from that?
 wiking	well it all depends if that funciton has any real impact :)
 wiking	i mean vec1_plus_scalar_times_vec2 itself

 n4nd0	sonney2k: around?
@sonney2k	n4nd0, yes
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I read yesterday you said sth about that you had recruited a couple of menthors for gsoc
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it would be very cool if Georg Zeller could be menthor in an hypothetical next gsoc
 n4nd0	I was really happy with him while he helped me last summer
 n4nd0	only as a suggestion :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, I will check with him but there is still plenty time
 n4nd0	sure
 n4nd0	I just mentioned it since the topic poped up
 wiking	hehe i'm happy to sign up for mentoring ;P
@sonney2k	wiking, I will ask next spring :D
@sonney2k	but it seems like we can easily get ~5 mentors
 wiking	why's the but? :)
@sonney2k	no but
@sonney2k	I did expect it to be harder

@sonney2k	ptizoom, hey!
 ptizoom	hi
@sonney2k	do you have a minute?
 ptizoom	yep
@sonney2k	wanted to ask about the (surprise) perl interface
@sonney2k	I think the pdl variant is a good idea to support indeed
@sonney2k	not sure if anyone would use it from core perl anyways...
 ptizoom	why surprise?
@sonney2k	just joking :D
 ptizoom	yea, PDL was the best equivalent to pynum I thought.
 ptizoom	do you mean "core perl"  as opposed to PDL?
 ptizoom	why shogoonies always joke around?

 n4nd0	wiking: ping
 wiking	n4nd0: pong
 n4nd0	wiking: I am reading the code ATM
 n4nd0	I see you are playing with fire ... using std::vector :-O
 n4nd0	haha
 wiking	n4nd0: didn't have time
 wiking	wanted to finish the code
 wiking	:D
 n4nd0	wiking: so what is that you wanted to discuss?
 n4nd0	I have taken an overall look
 wiking	n4nd0: well Mosek.h
 wiking	because as u see now
 wiking	i'm directly using mosek.h
 wiking	it'd be cool to at least share some part of that mosek_qp_optimize with your Mosek.h wrapper
 n4nd0	definitely
 sonne_	ptizoom, why also :D
 wiking	n4nd0: so this is what i wanted to discuss
 wiking	how and when
 wiking	:>
 n4nd0	wiking: my idea was do one is able to do the stuff through the wrapper
 n4nd0	that* one, sorry for the type
 n4nd0	typo
 n4nd0	haha, I am idiot
 n4nd0	anyway
 n4nd0	what I wanted is that one can get rid of mosek if it comes the time we have alternative solvers in shogun for that
 wiking	heheh well yeah
 wiking	as you can see in the cutting_plane function
 wiking	there's a lot of uncommented code
 wiking	that part is for using SVM^light optimizer
 wiking	the problem with that is that the SVM^light in shogun does not have those functions ported
 wiking	that i need
 n4nd0	I am not sure I see the uncommented code you're talking about
 wiking	just a sec
 wiking	n4nd0: check line 332
 wiking	in https://gist.github.com/3938203
 n4nd0	what does CC in CCSOSVM stanfs for btw?
 wiking	copy-cat
 n4nd0	so what's up with line 332?
 wiking	so that line
 wiking	is basically if we would have a full svm^light port in shogun
 wiking	we could just use svm^light in this SO-SVm
 wiking	instead of mosek
 n4nd0	it looks good to do that then
 wiking	well the problem is that one needs to get svm^light into shogun
 n4nd0	too problematic?
 wiking	well it's just timeconsuming
 n4nd0	and what isn't? :D
 wiking	well i'm happy that we have already this one
 wiking	the question is
 wiking	what to do now with Mosek.h
 n4nd0	what do you want to do with it?
 wiking	well how to change it
 wiking	so that it could be shared
 n4nd0	I would say that it could be good to do a similar wrapper
 wiking	between PrimalMosek... and this
 n4nd0	so for example
 n4nd0	I wonder why is it that you couldn't just use CMosek::optimize
 wiking	givemeapatch
 wiking	:)
 n4nd0	of what?
 n4nd0	that code is already in shogun
 n4nd0	wiking: do you know what I am talking about?
 wiking	i know
 n4nd0	good :)
 wiking	should i just add the wrapper functions i need?
 n4nd0	for me that makes more sense
 n4nd0	to use the wrappers to put the Q, A, etc matrices
 n4nd0	to use the wrapper to solve the problem
 n4nd0	and so
 n4nd0	if you need other mosek functions, put other wrappers maybe
 n4nd0	but idk, maybe that doesn't make sense for you or you don't like it so
 n4nd0	gtg for dinner, I'll be back later
