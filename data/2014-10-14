 lambday	HeikoS: lisitsyn: hi
@lisitsyn	lambday: heya
 lambday	lisitsyn: how's it going man?
@lisitsyn	lambday: oh very busy but cool
@lisitsyn	what about you?
 lambday	haha
 lambday	lisitsyn: I came back to college to finish my degree..
 lambday	so back to Mumbai again
@lisitsyn	lambday: hmm interesting
@lisitsyn	wasn't it finished?
 lambday	lisitsyn: thesis work was incomplete.. so joined the company.. did training and worked for 3 months... now came back and finish it off
@lisitsyn	I see
@lisitsyn	so you escaped oracle?
 lambday	lisitsyn: nah.. :D took leave
@lisitsyn	ah
 lambday	lisitsyn: was going through aer..
@lisitsyn	lambday: ah cool
@lisitsyn	let me know what you think
 lambday	lisitsyn: cool thing with the Any thing
 lambday	lisitsyn: I was also going through this tutorial on dr. dobbs... where they try to make it cross platform
 lambday	currently aer is linux only, right?
@lisitsyn	hmm yeah
@lisitsyn	but shouldn't be a problem
 lambday	so that thing we can look into..
@lisitsyn	it is posix now
 lambday	lisitsyn: I was redesigning the statistical hypothesis testing part.. I think with the help of Any we can boost things up a notch
 lambday	also, so far I understood... this design fits nicely with the plugin design you have
@lisitsyn	lambday: yeah any thing comes from boost
@lisitsyn	as usual boost things are cool
@lisitsyn	although boost's any is not cool I believe :D
 lambday	lol I didn't mean that boost but yeah
@lisitsyn	I mean they just get RTTI
@lisitsyn	from the type
 lambday	I meant power it up
 lambday	yeah
@lisitsyn	and then compare strings
@lisitsyn	that's like super slow
 lambday	oh one thing I needed to discuss... if you have time
@lisitsyn	sure
 lambday	lisitsyn: at one place, I need to downcast from base feature/kernel ptr type to the actual feature/kernel ptr type... currently I'm doing that inside a switch case with the help of the enums that we have
@lisitsyn	lambday: I guess virtual function :D
@lisitsyn	but it would be not very nice I guess
 lambday	virtual function for what? typecasting?
 lambday	lisitsyn: I was thinking of demangling stuff that you have in aer
@lisitsyn	oh demangling doesn't sound reliable
@lisitsyn	can you explain it a bit more?
 lambday	ok.. trying
@lisitsyn	so you have to act according to the type of kernel?
 lambday	lisitsyn: so what we need is this - a set_foo(Base* ptr) function (non-templated) which calls a templated push_back(Derived* ptr) function internally with the actual type
 lambday	set_foo we releave to the modular interface
 lambday	reveal*
 lambday	now this thing is easy for features and kernels since we have these enums
 lambday	but what if I want this thing to work with a user defined feature class as well
 lambday	(not a hard requirement - just a good thing to have - users defining their own feature class with whatever the hell they wanna use - they just write a few policy classes that is required by the framework and voila!
 lambday	lisitsyn: one idea was to make set_foo(...) method templated.. but then one cannot use this set_foo(...) inside some non-templated (probably virtual) method where the ptr thing is passes as Base* and not Derived*
 lambday	so while set_foo calls push_back, we need to make the cast
@lisitsyn	lambday: I guess it is called multimethod
@lisitsyn	quite a few ways to implement it :D
 lambday	lisitsyn: name a few :D
@lisitsyn	lambday: iirc alexandrescu has some crazy stuff in his book about that
@lisitsyn	lambday: anyway exposing templated method doesn't sound nice
 lambday	lisitsyn: that's what I thought..
 lambday	and by his book you mean modern c++ design, right
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	lambday: why do you need to call this method on derived?
 lambday	so that I can set some type specific policies based on the actual type
 lambday	without the wrapper having to worry about the internal
 lambday	lisitsyn:
 lambday	ah wiki for multimethods uses a hashmap sort of thing - this is what I was thinking
@lisitsyn	lambday: well yeah you can actually put a map
@lisitsyn	but that's slower than virtual method
 lambday	and what should be the appropriate key-value pair that I can use in that map? a string as key and a functor as a value :D
@lisitsyn	lambday: what are real names for these methods?
 lambday	set_p(CFeatures* feats) .. set_q... set_kernel_p, set_kernel_q...
@lisitsyn	ah so you want to dispatch
 lambday	lisitsyn: https://github.com/lambday/flash/blob/develop/src/flash/statistics/HypothesisTest.cpp#L92
@lisitsyn	CFeatures -> features used by kernel
 lambday	this is what I have
 lambday	ummm... no
 lambday	I mean yeah eventually... but that's not why I require it here
@lisitsyn	lambday: static_cast<typename feats_traits<C_DENSE,F_DREAL>::type*>
@lisitsyn	what does it return?
@lisitsyn	what type?
 lambday	CDenseFeatures<float64_t>
 lambday	inside feats_traits its defined
@lisitsyn	lambday: does your data manager work different for that?
 lambday	yes
 lambday	it does something for dense, for sparse, and for streaming dense, streamaing sparse
 lambday	for strings
 lambday	etc
@lisitsyn	lambday: okay I'd actually suggest you to avoid using templates here as it is called only once
@lisitsyn	you don't really need perfomance here I believe
 lambday	lisitsyn: nah just a nicer way to handle this
@lisitsyn	lambday: I think you'd better go with some virtual methods
@lisitsyn	and dispatch all these fetchers and permutators dynamically
 lambday	lisitsyn: so you're suggesting making push_back non-templated
@lisitsyn	yeah
@lisitsyn	lambday: if you want to dispatch it before push back
@lisitsyn	I can suggest to create some temporary object
 lambday	and virtual methods have to be overridden somewhere for all the features and kernels I want to support
@lisitsyn	well you can delegate it to kernel
@lisitsyn	or feature
 lambday	lisitsyn: could you please explain a bit on the temporary object creation part?
 lambday	because I thought of that but couldn't do it
@lisitsyn	well you need permutator and fetcher
 lambday	yep
@lisitsyn	so you can push_back some object that stores features, permutator and fetcher
@lisitsyn	basically a tuple of these three
 lambday	but for getting the appropriate fetcher and permutator, we need to know the actual type
 lambday	even if we add another level of abstraction still it has to be handled by someone
@lisitsyn	lambday: can you delegate fetcher to the feature?
@lisitsyn	I mean can you let feature know of fetcher to use
@lisitsyn	feature->get_fetcher()
 lambday	lisitsyn: ah if these things are members then its super easy but this fetching and permutating thing is specific to the application.. so adding these to feature is probably not what we want
@lisitsyn	okay then create some dispatcher
@lisitsyn	dispatcher->get_fetcher(feature);
 lambday	what we can do is the define a internal feature class for this application and map CFeatures into that
 lambday	lisitsyn: dispatcher as a base class you mean?
@lisitsyn	lambday: well just some class that creates propers objects for you
 lambday	lisitsyn: that's what I had with get_instance - just that its templated
@lisitsyn	lambday: don't think you need it templated - looks like you going to suffer with this
@lisitsyn	not sure if these struggles worth it :)
 lambday	lisitsyn: well, the other way is ugly copy paste :(
 lambday	I thought let compiler do all that :D
@lisitsyn	ok my advice is to put all the dispatch to one place
@lisitsyn	and then you can play with that somehow
@lisitsyn	maps or something virtual
 lambday	as in, as overloaded methods?
 lambday	okay
@lisitsyn	push_back(dispatch(features));
@lisitsyn	let it go to some dispatch
@lisitsyn	then you at least have all the horror isolated in one function or class
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah that can be done - either the horror is there with the enums or dispatch
@lisitsyn	lambday: I think some table (kind of enum map) would work quite fast
@lisitsyn	int -> factory of permutators
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah... that's a better idea
@wiking	btw: https://github.com/Yelp/MOE
 lambday	lisitsyn: but horrifying thing is that we have two enums for features - feature type and feature class :(
 lambday	lisitsyn: why don't you like demangling stuffs? cause its compiler dependent?
@lisitsyn	lambday: slow and non-portable
@lisitsyn	okay got to go
 lambday	lisitsyn: alright.. thanks man
 lambday	btw +1 for the naming convention :D
 lambday	for shogun :D
@lisitsyn	haha
 lambday	btw found this place in Bangalore - thought I should share - http://image6.buzzintown.com/files/venue/upload_8000/upload_original/373327-shogun-malgudi-dhaba.PNG
 lambday	went to the place - nice food :)
