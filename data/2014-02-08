@sonney2k	lisitsyn, could you please give us the full error http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20140207-0059.html
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, otherwise it is too hard to fix issues

 lambday	sonne|osx: hi!
 lambday	sonne|osx: last year I used shogun for subsequent string kernel (for one of my class projects) - which is not in shogun yet.. I never sent a PR for that
 lambday	sonne|osx: today I got a mail from someone who queried about that - do you think we can add this?
 lambday	lol subsequence*

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ping?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: pong!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, can you do anything about the no error shown xslt?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah just wanted to do that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, please do - we really need to get that stuff green before actual gsoc
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: sure will do now
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: the confusing part is that it will be a big error thing

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, show me
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: give me half an hour
 lisitsyn	;)
@sonney2k	you have 5 minutes
@sonney2k	(that is what kirk is supposed to say)
@sonney2k	ok osx bot now works too
@wiking	sonney2k: ?
@wiking	sonney2k: what bot? :)
@sonney2k	wiking, http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/osx2%20-%20python
@wiking	ah u mean it went green :)
@wiking	i thought we've got an osx bot
@wiking	kudos for the fix
@wiking	sonney2k: what was the problem?
@sonney2k	wiking, floating points
@wiking	:<
@sonney2k	the way you compute how two floats are similar is far from trivial
@wiking	ok i owe one fix for the coveralls
@sonney2k	wiking, I just reconfigured the buildbot to create warnings not failues for the static analyze stuff
@sonney2k	wiking, one question - do you know if the wheezy memcheck will fail if we have only 'potential memory leaks'?
@sonney2k	wiking, ohh and good news we have the google cloud grant worth 1k$
@sonney2k	wiking, so maybe if you have time you move the stuff from fatbot -> google cloud?
@wiking	sonney2k: account?
@wiking	and for how long a 1k usd will get us going ?
@sonney2k	wiking, no idea
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: who am I supposed to send updated xslt?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, could you give us some example output first maybe?
 lisitsyn	yeah
@wiking	lisitsyn: just updated the gist
 lisitsyn	wiking: https://gist.github.com/lisitsyn/8793002
 lisitsyn	updated
@sonney2k	wiking, just sent you an invitation
@wiking	sonney2k: got it, just trying to see what's this :)
@wiking	lisitsyn: sonney2k i've just updated the xslt... so the next build should generate the new output
 lisitsyn	I don't mind to filter this output somehow
 lisitsyn	but it is a trickery to do in xslt :D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, could you just create an example please
@sonney2k	so we don't need to wait hours for each iteration?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah let me upload it
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10139213/share/tmp/test.html
 lisitsyn	damn
 lisitsyn	it blocks htmls I guess
 lisitsyn	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10139213/share/tmp/test.html.txt
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: please download and rename then open
@sonney2k	wiking, https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine/#pricing
@sonney2k	that's the prices
@sonney2k	wiking, so it is sth like 1$ per computing hour
@sonney2k	wiking, hard to reach if we don't do a cloud x-val project :D
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm i think they bill based on the online number of hours
@wiking	not the actual computing time or?
@sonney2k	looks like
@sonney2k	wiking, so choose sth that can last for ~100 days or so :)
@wiking	sonney2k: ok i'm just testing now
@wiking	btw where should the instance be
@wiking	us or eu?
@wiking	seems us is a bit cheaper
@wiking	ok cool this works nicely
@wiking	i'll shut down the instance now
@wiking	and i'll get back to continue hackint it later

@sonney2k	multiclass ocas seems to be totally b0rken
@sonney2k	66 uninited memory reads. wtf!?
@sonney2k	voila
@sonney2k	and fixed
@sonney2k	wiking, how can we require the osx test on the buildbot to work?
@sonney2k	wiking, it is currently allowing it to fail
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: is html ok?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, where is it?
 lisitsyn	https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10139213/share/tmp/test.html.txt
@sonney2k	ahh sorry
@sonney2k	checking
@wiking	sonney2k: check the .travis.yml file ;)
@wiking	sonney2k: simply remove the lines that are for osx build from allow_failures part
@wiking	namely remove these two
@wiking	- language: objective-c env: OSX=1
@wiking	which is just before
@wiking	virtualenv
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, would it be possible to add the failures in the short list so we have them at first glance?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, the pull down stuff is nice though :)
@sonney2k	wiking, doing thanks
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what do you mean by that?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, currently it lists only ./tests/unit/unit-MCLDA
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, woudl be nice if it said /tests/unit/unit-MCLDA (Potential Memory Leak (3))
 lisitsyn	ah okay easy
 shogun-buildbot	build #176 of clang34 - thread analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/176  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
@sonney2k	wiking, now since python works too on osx - could we not just build it on the osx bot too?
@sonney2k	ahh no I guess we need swig 2.0.12 / 3.0
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10139213/share/tmp/test.html.txt
 lisitsyn	wait wiat
 lisitsyn	dropbox is having fun
 lisitsyn	wiking: ich updated das xslt https://gist.github.com/lisitsyn/8793002
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, ok fine!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, now fix that malsar conditional memory read
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, then we only have one more critical in xml serialization
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: it is not malsar that is buggy :D
 lisitsyn	but a test
 lisitsyn	I am seeing the code and wondering if I was drunk or what
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, then fix it :D
 lisitsyn	yeah sure
 lisitsyn	makes sense
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, and of course the answer is yes
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	you are Russian
@sonney2k	my guess is that maybe you were not drunk
@sonney2k	so no wonder...
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: didn't we have some work on compilation speedup by besser82?
 lisitsyn	how did it end?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, not ready - will be a gsoc project
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, but you need libshogun only
 lisitsyn	I know
@sonney2k	and that is pretty fast anyway
 lisitsyn	just curious
 lisitsyn	yeah once parallel it is
@sonney2k	man what a crap - we need to get rid of this useless use of SG_UNSTABLE
@sonney2k	cluttering stuff with useless warnings doesn'thelp
@sonney2k	wiking, any idea what this NON-XML-CHAR stuff in serialization xml tests is about [NON-XML-CHAR-0x1B][1;34m[WARN][NON-XML-CHAR-0x1B][0m In file /home/buildslave/debian_wheezy_-_memcheck/build/src/shogun/structure/DisjointSet.cpp line 19: /home/buildslave/debian_wheezy_-_memcheck/build/src/shogun/structure/DisjointSet.cpp:CDisjointSet::CDisjointSet():

@sonney2k	we have a problem when serializing XML - inf values cause valgrind errors / issues
@sonney2k	serializing AS xml
