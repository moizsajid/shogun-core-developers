 Hieronymous	How do I run unit-tests in SHOGUN ?
 Hieronymous	Also, I am unable to install GoogleMock.
@wiking	Hieronymous, so
@wiking	just
@wiking	cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
@wiking	and then run
@wiking	make unit-tests
@wiking	that should build googlemock + unit tests
@wiking	and as well to run the tests
 Hieronymous	wiking: Yeah, I did that, read the wiki.
 Hieronymous	I am unable to install GoogleMock. Should I raise an issue ?
@wiking	what do yo umean
@wiking	by unable to install GoogleMock
@wiking	?
 Hieronymous	Test suite for meta examples does not exist!
 Hieronymous	When I run cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
 Hieronymous	It doesn't successfully complete. I have an error log on Cmake, should I pastebin ?
 Hieronymous	is OpenCL required for this ?
 Hieronymous	make: *** No rule to make target `unit-tests'.  Stop., I get this btw when I do make unit-tests, wiking.
@wiking	ok
@wiking	it's the same problem i had on my mac
 Hieronymous	Could you point me to how you solved it ?
@wiking	you can fix this temporarily
@wiking	adding one line
@wiking	to tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt
@wiking	add_dependencies(shogun-unit-test GoogleMock)
 Hieronymous	At the end of the file , wiking ?
@wiking	add it under this line
@wiking	ADD_EXECUTABLE(shogun-unit-test ${UNITTEST_SRC} ${TEMPLATE_GENERATED_UNITTEST})
 Hieronymous	wiking: Doesn't fix it :(
@wiking	you have to
@wiking	delete build
@wiking	and rerun cmake
@wiking	and then do the make unit-tests
@wiking	but now i have to go
@wiking	ttyl
 Hieronymous	wiking: Thanks. Sure. Its running now :)
 Hieronymous	wiking: btw, still the same. ttyl then.

@HeikoS	wiking: jo
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: I am unable to install GoogleMock, could you help ?
@HeikoS	Hieronymous:  hi!
@HeikoS	I guess it is because it was deleted from the servers
 Hieronymous	I also wrote some tests and would like to test them.
@HeikoS	yes I understand
@HeikoS	which version of shogun?
 Hieronymous	I am reading the instruction from the wiki.
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	can you sen dme a link?
 Hieronymous	I have the "bleeding edge", cloned directly from GitHub
 Hieronymous	Sure
 Hieronymous	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/wiki/README_developer
 Hieronymous	Its at the end.
 Hieronymous	wiking was helping me out, but had to leave.
@HeikoS	That file is outdated a bit I guess
@HeikoS	I think googlemock is bundled these days
@HeikoS	you can run the unit tests locally?
@HeikoS	make test
@HeikoS	the cmake switches are
@HeikoS	-DENABLE_TESTING=ON
 Hieronymous	make: *** No rule to make target `test'.  Stop.
 Hieronymous	Do I need to run it in build ?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	do make first
@HeikoS	just make
@HeikoS	and then cancel it
@HeikoS	then try make test again
@HeikoS	Ill be afk for a few mins now, but back later
@HeikoS	I can help you sort that out then
 Hieronymous	Sure HeikoS. Thanks. Also I wrote some Notebook examples for Manifold Learning (real world).
 Hieronymous	Check that out, I have tagged you. I haven't submitted a PR, need your input for it.
 Hieronymous	real world - > real dataset I meant.

 Hieronymous	Hey HeikoS
@HeikoS	Hieronymous:  jo!
 Hieronymous	Running this cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=on .. on a fresh build doesn't do anything.
 Hieronymous	Test suite for meta examples does not exist!
 Hieronymous	^Get this.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Could you tell me how you installed GoogleMock on your machine ?
@HeikoS	I didnt
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: let me check
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Sure.
@HeikoS	so it downloads it
@HeikoS	Scanning dependencies of target GoogleMock
@HeikoS	[  0%] Creating directories for 'GoogleMock'
@HeikoS	[  1%] Performing download step (download, verify and extract) for 'GoogleMock'
@HeikoS	-- verifying file...

@HeikoS	version 1.8.0
 Hieronymous	Mine doesn't.
@HeikoS	test suite for meta examples doesnt exist comes since you forgot
@HeikoS	git submodule init
@HeikoS	git submodule update
@HeikoS	btw
@HeikoS	so whats the log thelling after this
@HeikoS	[  1%] Performing build step for 'GoogleMock'
 Hieronymous	I will pastebin. Hold on.
 Hieronymous	http://pastebin.com/yQXbN8N2
 Hieronymous	I do the git submodule init/update in the root folder, shogun right ?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	oh yeah this error is from git submodule
 Hieronymous	Hold on. I am doing the update now.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: I also added the KNN_KDTREE comparison, take a look when you can.

@HeikoS	Hieronymous: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3535
@HeikoS	feel free to send a fix :)
@HeikoS	It should say: "Please initialize or update the 'data' git submodule"
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: cool will do soon
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Great, Also I wrote a notebook on Manifold Learning on real world dataset.
 Hieronymous	Lots to review, take your time :)
 Hieronymous	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/2674
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: hey that is great
@HeikoS	for the tapkee notebook?
 Hieronymous	Yep. USPS datset
@HeikoS	nice one
@HeikoS	should add it, we like such things
 Hieronymous	on, hold on.
 Hieronymous	There is a caveat.
 Hieronymous	I don't know if what I've done is "accurate" or not.
@HeikoS	not sure I know what you mean
@HeikoS	but let me look at a PR if you send it
 Hieronymous	I will link the prelim code, take a look, if thats what you want, a PR will be ready.
@HeikoS	thats easiest
@HeikoS	yeah cool, give a gist
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: PR it is then.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: so what about your error?=
 Hieronymous	The download just finished now.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: et voila!
@HeikoS	works?
@HeikoS	yeah so not sure why you were after googlemock?
 Hieronymous	make GoogleMock succeeded
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	so a few tips
@HeikoS	you want to try your unit test right?
 Hieronymous	make[3]: *** [Eigen3/src/Eigen3-stamp/Eigen3-download] Error 1
 Hieronymous	Hold on HeikoS
@HeikoS	k
 Hieronymous	This is what I got after make unit-tests
-!- praisethemoon [~praisethe@unaffiliated/praisethemoon] has quit [Ping timeout: 258 seconds]
@HeikoS	full error pls
 Hieronymous	file DOWNLOAD HASH mismatch
@HeikoS	maybe download failed?
@HeikoS	do you have eigen3 installed?
@HeikoS	on your machine I mean?
@HeikoS	because if you had, shogun would use that rather than downloading
 Hieronymous	Yes, I do have eigen3, its in usr/include
 Hieronymous	in fact, I have played around with eigen a bit.
@HeikoS	doesnt cmake detect it?
 Hieronymous	It does actually. Its in the list of packages which it found.
 Hieronymous	Although make was downloading the latest one I guess 3.2.8
 Hieronymous	I don't know my version.
 Hieronymous	I ran make unit-tests with sudo, it works!
 Hieronymous	I guess it needed permissions for writing stuff.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Can I run unit-tests submodule wise ?
 Hieronymous	I don't need to run all the tests just tests from SGSparseMatrix thats it.
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: The HessianLLE notebook (Tapkee) - https://gist.github.com/sudk1896/2b79f983e838e57a2d2cfc4f392edca9
 Hieronymous	Its an Ipython Notebook, let me know if thats something you want.
@HeikoS	no sudo please
@HeikoS	yeah you might have screwed up your directory rights at some point
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: running tests submodule wise doenst make sense
@HeikoS	we only have one src module
@HeikoS	so a few tips for runing tests
@HeikoS	you only want to run the tests you are after, right?
@HeikoS	so if that is unit
@HeikoS	you can disable the others in the build
 Hieronymous	Yep, HeikoS
@HeikoS	-DTRAVIS_DISABLE_*
@HeikoS	check this switch
@HeikoS	there is one for meta and one for libshogun examples
@HeikoS	then make test just runs the unit tests
@HeikoS	then second, you can filter out tests
@HeikoS	for that, you go to the build/tests/unit folder
@HeikoS	it contains the unit test binary
@HeikoS	you can run that by hand
@HeikoS	./shogun-unit-tests --getest_filter=YourTestName
@HeikoS	also accepts wildcards in the test name
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: BTW, we would welcome a patch with a readme on this :)
 Hieronymous	Great, HeikoS. A README on the entire process I went through ? :)
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: not the entire
@HeikoS	just little bits and pieces, tips that are useful
@HeikoS	like the ones I sent above
@HeikoS	it is always about small improvements to an existing readme
@HeikoS	rather than re-writing the whole thing from scratch :)
 Hieronymous	Sure, I will add them in the README then :)
@HeikoS	in the developer I guess
@HeikoS	there can be something on unit testing
@HeikoS	or I think our wiki also has an (empty) page on unit testing
@HeikoS	you could send a pr against that
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Yes, unfortunately it was. I had to ask wiking here beacuse of that.
 Hieronymous	The bug is not reproducible, so it is likely a hardware or OS problem.
 Hieronymous	Btw, I got this while running make unit-tests.
 Hieronymous	http://pastebin.com/xza0R8WP, its a problem with GoogleMock apparently.

 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Seems like there is an OS/hardware issue, I'm updating to Ubuntu 16.04
@HeikoS	sorry I dont understand?
@HeikoS	oh that is weird
@HeikoS	seems like you have filesystem issues
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: not sure updating ubuntu is the right way to solve this
@HeikoS	just fix your system :)
 Hieronymous	http://pastebin.com/xza0R8WP
 Hieronymous	Googling the error doesn't show up any results.
 Hieronymous	Giving it a last try. I'm out of options actually.
@HeikoS	check your filesystem
@HeikoS	run checks
@HeikoS	chekc access rights of the folder
 Hieronymous	Running make unit-tests one last time, lets see.
@HeikoS	no
@HeikoS	run filesystem tests
@HeikoS	try to pinpoint the error down
@HeikoS	it has nothing to do with shogun
 Hieronymous	Okay. How do "run filesystem tests". What should I be looking for ?
@HeikoS	google :)
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: Is this behavior normal - 58% tests passed, 185 tests failed out of 436
 Hieronymous	Should all the tests pass ideally >
 Hieronymous	?
@HeikoS	it depends on your setup
 Hieronymous	A lot of them didn't evenr run.
@HeikoS	on our test servers, all tests pass
 Hieronymous	*even
@HeikoS	you can check for the reason a test fails easily
@HeikoS	ctest -R yourTestName -V
 Hieronymous	75 FAILED TESTS,  YOU HAVE 113 DISABLED TESTS
 Hieronymous	A lot of GPU related tests fail or don't run.
@HeikoS	yeah as I said, can be the case
@HeikoS	but you have to check WHY they fail in order to say something
@HeikoS	I can only guess otherwise
 Hieronymous	Also, I don't think I have ViennaCL installed, those tests fail as well.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: as I said
@HeikoS	this is guessing ;)
 Hieronymous	Do I need to run that command in root ?
 Hieronymous	the ctest one ?
@HeikoS	*never* run anything as root unless your installing software :)
 Hieronymous	Noooo, I meant from which directory ?
@HeikoS	ah :)
 Hieronymous	I meant the main folder i.e. shogun
@HeikoS	in build
@HeikoS	it is a cmake command
@HeikoS	google it, they have nice docs and tips how to use it
 Hieronymous	Another thing to add to README then :0
 Hieronymous	:)
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	definitely :)
@HeikoS	we hsould have a whole wiki page on testing
@HeikoS	with all the details
 Hieronymous	I will do that then :) I guess I have learnt a fair bit today.
@HeikoS	thats great!
@HeikoS	make sure to share it, really useful for others as well
@HeikoS	basically, whenever your have a problem, somebody else will have it as well :)
@HeikoS	so help them, so they can start from where you left
 Hieronymous	I will go through today's logs and see what was worth sharing. Yep, I was a GSoC student this year (with a diff. org).
 Hieronymous	I did this a lot, writing docs/READMEs.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: ah there you go, you know a bit about open source then
@HeikoS	yeah its most important
@HeikoS	and we are bad at it :)
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: so all help really really welcome
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: so what brings you to shogun?
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: C++ and ML. I am tired of using C++ narrowly for 3 years. Want to learn "real-world" usage.
 Hieronymous	I use C++ for programming competitions.
@HeikoS	ah cool !
 Hieronymous	Albeit only STL. NOt much of anything else really.
@HeikoS	yeah shogun has a big build process around it due to the many interfaces
@HeikoS	and due to its portability and backwards compatibility
@HeikoS	so lots of non c++ things to learn, cmake, buildbot, travis, our own stuff, etc
@HeikoS	we do some cool low level c++ stuff atm
 Hieronymous	Hence looking for C++ projects to contribute to. Yep, Travis I know :)
@HeikoS	or did in gsoc
 Hieronymous	TravisCI is like a good friend :) My previous org was a bit small compared to SHOGUN. not to forget, it was Python based.
 Hieronymous	Not a lot of low level stuff there.
@HeikoS	Hieronymous: cool yeah so let me know if you need any help
@HeikoS	it can be quite overwhealming our framework
@HeikoS	which project was it?
@HeikoS	maybe I met them at the summit
 Hieronymous	HeikoS: OpenAstronomy is the umbrella.
@HeikoS	ah cool
 Hieronymous	SunPY was the org i contributed to.
@HeikoS	yeah I met these german physicists
@HeikoS	from munich
 Hieronymous	The project lead is actually based out of UCL.
@HeikoS	I think they might have been part of that
@HeikoS	ah cool
@HeikoS	I should meet up with them
@HeikoS	your know wolfgang kernzendorf?
 Hieronymous	My mentor is a Researcher in Astrophysics at UCL. HeikoS: I only know them by nicknames.
 Hieronymous	:)
 Hieronymous	IRC nicks.
