 lambday	besser82: well, what I needed was to add support for viennacl mainly, and define a HAVE_LINALG_LIB whenever there is viennacl OR eigen3 available
@besser82	lambday, in cmake?
 lambday	besser82: could you please check the cmake code and let me know if its done properly?

 lambday	besser82: btw, had totally spicy indian food tonight - don't know whether I can sleep - its too hot :/
@besser82	lambday, hehe  ;)  I'd try some milk and bread  =)
@besser82	lambday, might come in handy
 lambday	besser82: better!! its like 100 degrees here!
@besser82	lambday, that sounds pretty hot
 lambday	plus the alcohol!
 lambday	uff
@besser82	lambday, not a real good combo  :(
@besser82	lambday, spicy food + alc + hot temp
 lambday	besser82: nope :( regretting already :(
 lambday	living in a seaside city still its so hot! just umimaginable
@besser82	lambday, then go sleeping on the beach @ shallow water  ;)
@besser82	lambday, might be cool enough  :D
 lambday	haha the beach is like 15 miles from here :D
@besser82	car?
 lambday	besser82: don't have :(
@besser82	that's bad...
 lambday	best way is to take a shower and just sleep on the terrace!
@besser82	that might help as well
 lambday	phew! ya gonna try that only! :(
@besser82	If it's too hot, I usually sleep in the basement  ;)
@besser82	chilling ~ 12? around the year
 lambday	besser82: classic! you remind me of harry potter :( I live in a hostel - don't have a basement :'(
@besser82	lambday, mhhh... I c
 lambday	~12 degrees is the dream!
 lambday	we have this temp in winters
@besser82	lambday, no winters are more chilled over here  :(
@besser82	lambday, like <= -5? outside
@besser82	lambday, a few years ago we had ~ -20?
 lambday	besser82: lol! I have never lived under - temp
@besser82	lambday, yes india is a little warmer than germany  :D
 lambday	but I love winters more! lived in 0 degrees though but never -
@besser82	lambday, you don't wanna try that
 lambday	a "little" is an understatement :D
@besser82	lambday, on those temps you would get an instant cold, if you are not used to that
 lambday	there are parts in india that are always below 0 but I don't live there!
@besser82	lambday, k2?  himalaya?  :-P
@besser82	lambday, ain't the yeti from there?
 lambday	besser82: yeah mostly the northern parts - kashmir, himachal (places near to himalayas)
 lambday	lol yeti :D
@besser82	lambday, yes I believe in yetis existing
 lambday	I went to a place called "manali" in the himachal in june and the temp was so low that my ass froze in the morning even when it was burning in rest of india
 lambday	besser82: you're kiddin :D
@besser82	lambday, no, have you ever seen Reinhold Messner?
 lambday	besser82: is that a movie?
 lambday	besser82: in either case, no
@besser82	lambday, no a climber  ;)
 lambday	no I didn't! don't say that he claimed to have seen yetis
@besser82	lambday, no, but he looks very close:  http://www.naturns.it/bilder/thumbs/portrait-bild-reinhold-messner.jpg
 lambday	HAHAHAHHAHA!
 lambday	besser82: lol :D yeah close enough!
@besser82	lambday, *ROFL*
@besser82	lambday, so they MUST exist  :-P
 lambday	besser82: in the age of photoshop, they definitely do ;)
 lambday	this pic could seriously be turned into one - just a little patch of white and voila!
 lambday	you're taurus? :P
@besser82	lambday, which taurus?
 lambday	besser82: the astrological one
@besser82	lambday, nope,  cancer
 lambday	haha :D
@besser82	lambday, Nick comes from an old game called `Interstate '76`
 lambday	I gathered that from MrTaurus
 lambday	besser82: oh no idea about that
 lambday	:D
@besser82	lambday, was back in 1997  ;)
@besser82	lambday, I think you are a bit to young for that  ;)
 lambday	besser82: I was in 5th grade trying to figure out the arithmetic problems that my teacher gave me
@besser82	lambday, hehe
 lambday	besser82: didn't have a computer till it was 2005 :d
@besser82	lambday, me was 15 back then  ;)
 lambday	I was 10 :D
@besser82	lambday, so you are older than lisitsyn  ;)
 lambday	besser82: lol we had a long discussion on this on our gsoc startup meeting :D
 lambday	lisitsyn is no longer the youngest boy in the camp
@besser82	lambday, who is it?
 lambday	besser82: kislay - I guess he's '94 born
 lambday	so just 3 years old when you played this game!
@besser82	lambday, ahhh...
@besser82	lambday, :D
 lambday	lol :D
 lambday	I felt so old!
 lambday	you make me feel better about myself :D
 lambday	not better, younger :P
@besser82	lambday, another good thing I did today  :D
 lambday	besser82: what is it?
 lambday	ohhh
 lambday	:D
@besser82	lambday, making you feel better ^^
 lambday	besser82: yeah just got that! god bless you :D
 lambday	well, watching oprah on letterman is not the perfect way to end a day but I can't take it anymore :D
 lambday	besser82: going to sleep!... please share your comments on that PR when you have some free time :)
 lambday	looking forward to that :)
@besser82	lambday, sure will do so  :D
@besser82	lambday, good night!  :D

 thoralf	hey abinash_panda
@besser82	thoralf, morning!  :D
@besser82	thoralf, after getting the enlightning about how $NLP-Stuff works...
 thoralf	besser82: I won't call it NLP ;P
@besser82	thoralf, C'mon  :-P
@besser82	thoralf, converting text-data to sth. useful, then  ;)
 thoralf	BLP
 thoralf	BesserLanguageProcessing
@besser82	thoralf, ROFL
@besser82	thoralf, I think we can get sth. real tight and burning with LLDA  ;)
@besser82	thoralf, Just using that SVM-approach to get some initial labels on the topics to do some further modelling with labeled LDA  :D
@besser82	thoralf, so with lLDA we can have a reinforcable && predictive model on that ;)
@besser82	thoralf, so we retrain the model with user-input and don't end-up with mixed up lda-topics  :D
* besser82 fresh , Ghetto chef  :-P
 thoralf	Yo.
 thoralf	That's the goal. ;)
 thoralf	But don't need llda.  Simply wrapping LDA output into $machine.
 thoralf	Let's don't spam the channel.
 abinash_panda	thoralf: Hey!
 abinash_panda	thoralf: I was going through your reply. I am sorry, I am unable to get it. If you could help in that
