 thoralf	kprah: Have a look how we're reading files in the unit tests or examples.
 thoralf	kprah: I think there are plenty of examples.
 thoralf	Do you want your file to be part of the unit tests, i.e. you're committing this file to the repository?
 kprah	yeah.
 kprah	This file was generated in pythn
 kprah	as you see in the issue
 kprah	my fix works locally.
 thoralf	Does the created file exist in the repository already or how should it be created before running your test?
 kprah	thoralf: generating such a matrix from c++ gives no errors.
 kprah	thoralf: I mean it works perfectly. But while reading file generated by this way,
 kprah	thoralf: we get an extra feature. So my fix takes care of both the cases locally.
 kprah	thoralf: By the way, yeah it should be generated before test
 kprah	any particular examples?
 kprah	thoralf?
 thoralf	Where does the error occur?  While saving or while loading?

 thoralf	Hey iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	thoralf, sup
 thoralf	everything sup ;)
@iglesiasg	haha that's good then :)
 kprah	sorry.
 kprah	Was away for a few minutes
 kprah	Error occurs while loading by ctest after make install step
 thoralf	kprah: No, I mean the error you're working on.
 thoralf	The serialization error.
 thoralf	This error happens while saving or loading?
 kprah	loading
 thoralf	Well, then commit this example file to shogun-data?
 thoralf	So you can load it from inside the test.
 thoralf	Good weather outside.  Need to charge my batteries in the sun.  See you!
 kprah	ok. What should be the filename then?
 kprah	thoralf?
 thoralf	Don't know.  test_input_for_bug_1991.csv?
 thoralf	Away now.
 kprah	ok. Thank you very much. Bye!
 kprah	hello, iglesiasg
@iglesiasg	hello kprah
 kprah	I was discussing a doubt with thoralf just now.
 kprah	iglesiasg: can you help me?
@iglesiasg	kprah, let me check the logs
 kprah	iglesiasg: most of it happened in the private chat
 kprah	iglesiasg: can I explain?
@iglesiasg	kprah, sure. Go ahead please
 kprah	iglesiasg: I am working on issue 1991.
@iglesiasg	kprah, ok, what have you done so far?
 kprah	I found the bug and fixed it locally. But I am facing a strange problem while loading the test_20k.csv
 kprah	iglesiasg: can you see it?

@iglesiasg	kprah, I am reading the issue yes, if that's what you mean
@iglesiasg	kprah, I see you opened a pull request as well
 kprah	iglesiasg: yeah.
@iglesiasg	kislay, although I don't think we want those csv files in the repository
@iglesiasg	kprah, oh sorry, I talked to the wrong person :)
 kislay	iglesiasg, :D
 kprah	but the unit tests fail when ctest runs. I checked it in travis logs. The reason is it is unable to load that csv file.
 kprah	iglesiasg: any insights on how to load this file?
@iglesiasg	kprah, what are the dependencies of CSVFile? Maybe there is something not installed in travis and that's why the error
 kprah	CSVFile depends on three classes, CLineReader, CDelimiterTokenizer and CParser
 kprah	iglesiasg: Well in the unit test I need that csv file generated by np.random.rand(20000, 70)
 kprah	iglesiasg: The fact is when I run the unit test via ./shogun-unit-test
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@2.248.35.30] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
 kprah	it runs fine
@iglesiasg	kprah, I meant dependencies as installed libraries, not other classes
 kprah	It is a core class of shogun only
 kprah	doesn't depend on other libraries
@iglesiasg	kprah, all right
@iglesiasg	kprah, have you found out what the exact line where the error arises is
 kprah	iglesiasg:
 kprah	yeah
 kprah	http://pastebin.com/1w20Ubpg
 kprah	iglesiasg: here while loading test_20k.csv, ctest fails.
 kprah	probably because ctest runs from a different directory
@iglesiasg	kprah, could it be related to the path to the file?
 kprah	Yeah,
 kprah	I thought of using absolute pathnames but that is not a good practice.
@iglesiasg	kprah, why don't you just generate random data within the test?
 kprah	iglesiasg: That works fine. There is a unit test already present. See CSVFile_unittest.cc -> matrix_int32
 kprah	iglesiasg: The bug was found days ago by one of the guests who reported it on IRC
@iglesiasg	kprah, I meant to generate random data in the test, save it into a temporary file, do the test and then remove the file
 kprah	iglesiasg: Yeah. There is a test for that already. It is the test that I just mentioned above
 kprah	and it passes well.
 kprah	it only doesn't pass for the ones generated from numpy , as described in the issue by viktor (wiking)
 kprah	so I thought maybe loading the file directly would be fine
@iglesiasg	kprah, I don't think the problem is related to creating the file from numpy..
 kprah	iglesiasg: Well I used the file given by this, and confirmed that there is indeed an extra feature.
 kprah	iglesiasg: But if you do it by the one generated from libshogun
 kprah	it just works fine.
 kprah	Can I post the screenshots?
 kprah	Well actually ..... You are right. THe bug was in CSVFile class itself
@iglesiasg	kprah, why don't you just try to see if the problem is because of the path to the file?
 kprah	where, in the unit test?
 kprah	iglesiasg?
@iglesiasg	kprah, run locally the tests exactly as travis does, from the same directory, using the same commands. You should be able to see this in the travis logs
 kprah	Yeah. I did it locally too.
 kprah	it failed while loading the file.
 kprah	but when I make a separate program
 kprah	using int main() and do all my things there it works fine (as it should)
 kprah	iglesiasg?
@iglesiasg	kprah, I cannot tell you more apart from what I already said :)
 kprah	So the main difficulty that I am facing right now is while loading this file in my unit test.I fixed the bug otherwise, and confirmed it by making a separate program.
 kprah	iglesiasg?

 thoralf	Hey kprah
 kprah	hey
 kprah	can we get the shogun root directory name from SGIO?
 kprah	or some other file, thoralf?
 kprah	You are from?
 thoralf	kprah: If you have a minimal file, then it should be possible to generate it automatically from the unit test.  So no need for getting the path.
 thoralf	kprah: Do you know what the *minimal* parameters for this problem are?
 kprah	thoralf: I think just a csv file with some data.
 kprah	thoralf: Well if you see the already present unit test in tests/unit/io, there is a test already which passes.
 thoralf	The macro __FILE__ should be expanded to the name of the unit-test.
 thoralf	__FILE__ ".testdata" could be used as the filename for your data.
 thoralf	But still, I insist that you create some *minimal* example.
 thoralf	12 MB example of such file is not acceptable.
 kprah	ok ..... I guess I'll have to make the whole library again , since python modular is turned off :D
 kprah	thoralf: can I get back to you after some minutes?
 thoralf	Wait.
 thoralf	No need to rebuild it.
 kprah	Then, how do I turn python modular on?
 kprah	thoralf?
 thoralf	No, try to analyze the problem.
 thoralf	You should be able to do it without running python again.
 thoralf	Just look to the file - what caused the problem?
 thoralf	If you run the (old, unfixed) code on the same file, how many features/vectors do you get?
 kprah	20001
 thoralf	Okay.  And if you remove the trailing newline, how many will you get then?
 thoralf	Only the newline.  All data stays the same.
 kprah	ok let me try that
 kprah	There is no trailing newline here I guess. I am opening it in gedit.

 kprah	thoralf, but for any given file how do we know what are the insides beforehand?
 thoralf	Please answer my question first.
 thoralf	If you remove the trailing newline (there is one) will the output is correct then?
 kprah	How do I do it, manually or by code? I am unable to see a newline after the last line.
 kprah	thoralf?
 thoralf	Just edit the code with your editor.
 thoralf	Sorry, the data file.

 kprah	thoralf, 20001

 thoralf	No more lines, no more features.
 kprah	ok let me see.
