@sonney2k	sploving1, all good, i.e. making progress?
 sploving1	sonney2k, I am looking for generator.py
 sploving1	looking generator.py
@sonney2k	for or at?
 sploving1	at. learning it
 sploving1	os.path.insert?
 sploving1	I did not see any docs about this
 sploving1	sys.path.insert(0, '.')
 sploving1	what does that mean?
@sonney2k	sploving1, I mean you know what it is supposed to do. I don't think you can learn from that python example - I would suggest you just start fresh and write this in java
@sonney2k	python doesn't really help you here...
 sploving1	but I need understand what function that I should write
@sonney2k	sploving1, but I told you and I know mikio too
@sonney2k	again - just call the functions in each example
@sonney2k	take what they return
@sonney2k	and serialize this to disk
@sonney2k	that's it
@sonney2k	staring at python code won't help you with this
 sploving1	why? understanding python is a quich way.
 sploving1	I do not know how to serialize this to disk
@sonney2k	http://www.google.com/search?q=java+serialize
@sonney2k	and mikio is the java expert ask him
 sploving1	oh
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.238.99] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	sploving1, better finish translating the examples first
@sonney2k	I mean mostly only the more simple ones remain
@sonney2k	like features_*
@sonney2k	morning blackburn!
@sonney2k	how's your bear?
 sploving1	ofcourse I transfer all of them.
 sploving1	they are easy. I like to do things changllge
 sploving1	first
 blackburn	sonney2k: morgen! my bear is walking here somewhere
@sonney2k	sploving1, yeah but it makes sense to finish one thing and then start the next
@sonney2k	sploving1, in particular when a deadline is coming up and you don't have time to do more experimental stuff
 sploving1	before the deadline, I will finishe them all. testsuite, docs and examples
@sonney2k	sploving1, OK then just go ahead... and don't forget to ask if you get stuck (to not loose time...)
 sploving1	oh
 sploving1	sonney2k, I found there are *0.txt, *1.txt in testsuite tests. why 0 and 1?
 sploving1	two test with the same mane
 sploving1	I know. there are two para.
 sploving1	parameters
@sonney2k	sploving1, there are a number of parameter settings defined in the examples
@sonney2k	functions are called for each setting
@sonney2k	so we just index them with 0,1,2...
 sploving1	oh. I know
 sploving1	sonne2y, in java, also need set 2 parameter settings?
@sonney2k	sploving1, as many as are specified in the example
 sploving1	sonney2k, the I need change every example likt pytho using string[] parameter_list
 sploving1	in the classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular.py example, why parameter_list = [[traindat,testdat,label_traindat,1.,1000,1],[traindat,testdat,label_traindat,1.,1000,1]]
 sploving1	the two para is the same?
@sonney2k	sploving1, you need to change every example anyways- turn them into functions
@sonney2k	sploving1, yes that is stupid
@sonney2k	a mistake I would say
@sonney2k	please lower the first 1000 to e.g. 10
 sploving1	oh.

@sonney2k	heiko!
@sonney2k	good morning
 heiko	hi sonney2k
 bettyboo	moin
 heiko	had a good sleep? :)
@sonney2k	I might have found the correct way of saying friend to templates
 bettyboo	:)
@sonney2k	heiko, didn't you know - I don't sleep
 heiko	yes? ok would be nice, I had a talk about this and some more thoughts, and I came to the conclusion that this does not work the way I want it
 heiko	oh well :)
 heiko	hehe,
@sonney2k	heiko, it is committed already
 heiko	12 hours of hacking followed by 12 hours of baby sitting :)
 heiko	ok I will have a look
@sonney2k	if it works it was just a syntax thing
 sploving1	sonney2k, you do not sleep????
@sonney2k	sploving1, get kids and you know what I mean
 sploving1	I thought you are in regular work now
 sploving1	great father!
@sonney2k	yes once kids are there - they stay around :D
 bettyboo	:) sonney2k
 heiko	sonney2k, what did you change?
@sonney2k	heiko https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/37fcfdc4c5a3dcea44dbbc6d35c578f3866a2e92
 heiko	so it is just the other template argument?
 heiko	weird
@sonney2k	heiko, you can have one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many friend relation ships with templates
* sonney2k who would have thought that
 heiko	ok alright, this is really new to me :)
 heiko	thought you had to give the concrete class you want to be friend with
 heiko	.

 sploving1	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/BEtSdTTf
 sploving1	I changed one example, and need your help to check if it is the correct what we expected
 heiko	could someone fix this:
 heiko	line 179 of Mathematics.cpp
 heiko	replace
 heiko	SGMatrix<float64_t> table(NULL,2,3);
 heiko	by
 heiko	SGMatrix<float64_t> table((float64_t*)NULL,2,3);
 heiko	I have other stuff in my master branch currently :(
 heiko	ambigious call compile error
 CIA-32	shogun: Sergey Lisitsyn master * r57f2cfa / src/libshogun/lib/Mathematics.cpp : Fixed ambiguous ambiguity - http://bit.ly/nBFIwx
 blackburn	heiko: here you go ^)
 heiko	thanks :)
 bettyboo	ha ha!?!
 sploving1	hello blackburn, in python example, we could  return perceptron, out_labels. then in java, how do we return two object?
 blackburn	return collection containing two objects if it is necessary
 sploving1	which collection can store different type of objects?
 sploving1	ArrayList is good
 blackburn	yes, it is ok
 blackburn	all collections are generic
 sploving1	blackburn, what about parameters? for instance, in python, parameter_list = [[traindat,testdat,label_traindat,1.,1000,1],[traindat,testdat,label_traindat,1.,1000,1]]
 sploving1	classifier_averaged_perceptron_modular(*parameter_list[0])
 sploving1	if I want to implement similar parameter_list, then use ArrayList also?
 heiko	blackburn, sonney2k, dynamic_casts allowed in shogun?
 blackburn	sploving1: yes, or collection of array lists :)
 blackburn	heiko: where do you need it?? :)
 heiko	in my new DynamicObjectArray
 heiko	to ensure that generic type T is of type CSGObject
 blackburn	I don't know.. anyway you can change it later if it is bad
 heiko	yes
 heiko	will just use
 sploving1	blackburn, ArrayList parameterOne = new ArrayList(); parameterOne.add(new Double(1.0)); parameterOne.add(new Integer(1000));
 sploving1	then how to get 1.0 and 1000 from the list?
 blackburn	.get(0), get(1), ...
 sploving1	need type converstion. int a = parapameterOne.get(0), will be OK? blackburn
 blackburn	int a = ((Integer)parameterOne.get(1)).intValue();
 blackburn	something like that
 sploving1	so complex
 blackburn	just conversion from Integer to int
 blackburn	and typecast - get() returns Object - it is generic
 sploving1	oh

 petiera	hallo! could you help me get started with this toolbox? If I already have similarity-matrices and would like to use a CombinedKernel, is it enough to just make CustomKernels using the matrices and then append them to the CombinedKernel? Or do I have to have Features as well?

@sonney2k	blackburn, only the tough questions for me?
@sonney2k	petiera, I am not sure - in the worst case create some DummyFeatures within a CombinedFeatures object
@sonney2k	petiera, if get_kernel_matrix works w/o then yes you are fine :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, the questions I can't answer :)
@sonney2k	sploving1, is it possible to use non-ascii too? I mean not just strings but tuples utilizing the actual types?
 sploving1	I am tring ArrayList
 sploving1	sonney2k, which can contain various types
@sonney2k	otherwise you have to the conversion in the example (I am not a big fan of this...)
@sonney2k	sploving1, sounds good
@sonney2k	hmmhh heiko is gone already?
@sonney2k	!
 blackburn	sonney2k: which conversion?
@sonney2k	"1" -> 1
 petiera	sonney2k: ok, thanks, I'll try that
 blackburn	sonney2k: you make me scared, string 'typization' is scaring
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but that is why I don't like sploving1 suggestions that much ( http://pastebin.com/BEtSdTTf )
@sonney2k	petiera, and let us know what the outcome is please!
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	petiera, I remember doing some hacks that features are not required but I cannot remember and we don't have an example for combined custom kernels yet...
 sploving1	sonney2k, http://pastebin.com/43zkc1Ts
 sploving1	take a look at the new version
@sonney2k	blackburn, ^ can one write things more compact?
@sonney2k	the parameter_list is quite longish now
 blackburn	sonney2k: I don't think so
 blackburn	sonney2k: Collections.asList(new Double(10), new Integer(1000)); -- better?
 petiera	sonney2k: yeah, I tried to look for examples but didn't find anything similiar there. I tried it now with two random square matrices and I do get a matrix out of the CombinedKernel's get_kernel_matrix, however the weights are both 1.0
@sonney2k	petiera, both?
 petiera	of course the input matrices are just random, but I'd still expect some deviations
@sonney2k	what do you mean
 petiera	yes, both
@sonney2k	petiera, what does both mean
@sonney2k	petiera, put your code to pastebin or so
 petiera	sonney2k: aa, sorry :) it means that when I give two CustomKernels to the CombinedKernel and train it with SVM, the subkernel weights are both 1.0
@sonney2k	petiera, sure
@sonney2k	the svm won't change them
 sploving1	blackburn, you mean : parameterOne = Collections.asList(new Double(10), new Integer(1000));
 petiera	http://pastebin.com/GwAgXv9j
 blackburn	well may be just simply
 blackburn	parameter_list.add(Collections.asList(...));
 blackburn	it could be shorter and should work
 blackburn	will test it in a min
@sonney2k	that is slightly better
 blackburn	we can't do non-homogenous collection of simple types
 blackburn	so that new Double is required unfortunately
 petiera	sonney2k: so does it mean that the CombinedKernel isn't optimized?
 blackburn	sploving1: you haven't initialized your parameter list
 blackburn	use not public ArrayList parameter_list;
 sploving1	fixed parameter_list = new ArrayList();
 blackburn	but public Collection parameter_list = new ArrayList(2);
@sonney2k	petiera, yes of course not
@sonney2k	why should it be changed?
@sonney2k	petiera, it is just an SVM with two kernels
@sonney2k	perhaps you want to do MKL?
 blackburn	sploving1: ah yes you shouldn't use Collection, it has no get
 petiera	sonney2k: Yes, that would be my intention
 sploving1	blackburn, then use what?
 blackburn	sploving1:
 blackburn	ArrayList pars = new ArrayList(2);
 blackburn	pars.add(Arrays.asList(new Double(1.0), new Integer(1000)));
 blackburn	sth like that
 petiera	sonney2k: ahh, so probably MKLClassifier? :)
 bettyboo	hoho
@sonney2k	yep
 petiera	hehe. thanks for help! As I said, I'm just getting to know this toolbox :)
 sploving1	blackburn, then how to cast type pars.get(0)
 blackburn	sploving1: just List
 sploving1	then how to get List 's first elment?
 sploving1	blackburn, List x= .., x[0]??
 blackburn	((List)parameters.get(0)).get(0)
 sploving1	sonney2k, blackburn, I found org.shogun.* also hava List
 sploving1	class org.shogun.List
 sploving1	double learn_rate = ((Double)para.get(0)).doubleValue()
 sploving1	error
@sonney2k	sploving1, but it is typed
@sonney2k	better not use shogun lists
@sonney2k	for this purpose
 sploving1	sonney2k, I do not mean to use shogun list, but its used by the system
 blackburn	import java.util.List
 sploving1	worked! http://pastebin.com/cMTZhQ7K
 sploving1	sonney2k, do you think this example could be used by generator.py?
 sploving1	generator.java(maybe)
 sploving1	the example has no return type in main function!!!!
@sonney2k	sploving1, do you need to do new ArrayList(2); and then add?
 blackburn	sonney2k: he could init it just where it is declared
@sonney2k	sploving1, it looks good to me otherwise - I would group the shogun imports and java imports to beautify things a bit
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't understand?
 blackburn	sonney2k: line 12
 sploving1	 public ArrayList parameter_list = new ArrayList(2);
 sploving1	you mean this?
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	ahh ok yes
 sploving1	sounds good
 sploving1	how to group them sonney2k.
@sonney2k	sploving1, I mean all the imports java* behind the shogun ones
 sploving1	I know. java.util first
 sploving1	oh
 sploving1	The last thing I worried is that this example could be called by generator.java and tester.java
 sploving1	if can, I will then change all the other examples
 sploving1	so I would first write the genetrator.java and  tester.java to test this example
@sonney2k	it is still nicely readable - which is good :)

@sonney2k	heiko, did the template thing work?
 heiko	sonney2k, hi, yes compiles
@sonney2k	great
 heiko	I step wise replace stuff
 heiko	but I got a nasty memory bug currently
@sonney2k	heiko, I wasn't sure what you meant me to do with your last pull request
 heiko	It was just to show the code, just forget it
@sonney2k	ok closing then
 heiko	When the DynArray->DynamicObjectArray replacement is done for all places, python will hopefully run
 petiera	sonney2k: now when I call train() on a MKLClassification-object with a CombinedKernel, I get "Interleaved MKL optimization is currently only supported with SVMlight
 heiko	think I already did?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	you did :)
@sonney2k	petiera, which says it all... so disable it
@sonney2k	or enable SVMlight
 petiera	sonney2k: I'm using python, so should I recompile the C++?
 petiera	I mean if I want to enable SVMlight
@sonney2k	if you need it excessively yes ./configure --interfaces=libshogun,python_modular
@sonney2k	yes
 petiera	ok
 petiera	thanks again for helping, and have a nice weekend!

 sploving1	sonney2k, are you around?
@sonney2k	yes
 sploving1	how to edit the doc?
 sploving1	I would add doc first when waiting for the email
@sonney2k	sploving1, go to doc/pages directory
 sploving1	I mean http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/installation.html this page
@sonney2k	then edit Installation.mainpage
 sploving1	sonne2k, I thought online editing
@sonney2k	?
@sonney2k	no it is all doxygen
@sonney2k	just run make doc in doc/ to get the updated pages
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh I just realize that my nice automagic make release script won't work any longer
@sonney2k	that all is still svn based
 blackburn	sonney2k: which oe?
 blackburn	one*
 blackburn	make release?
 blackburn	what is it?
@sonney2k	that will take some time to get this reliably working with git too
@sonney2k	blackburn, it did run tests
@sonney2k	modify the version and tag the release
@sonney2k	then upload everything gpg signed
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	including docs and webpage changes
 blackburn	sonney2k: I guess sploving1 will write another one JUnit  :D
 sploving1	blackburn, JUnit? never heard
@sonney2k	blackburn, please not
 blackburn	sploving1: framework for testing :)
@sonney2k	it is totally sufficient to have regression tests like this - if it works
@sonney2k	in the worst case we will serialize shogun objects and compare if they are different
 blackburn	sonney2k: I mean that what he will write - is kind of 'truncated' JUnit :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, I hope it is very lightweigth, i.e. just ~100 lines java
@sonney2k	not a JUnit monster
 blackburn	sonney2k: non-trivial thing :)
 bettyboo	:*)
@sonney2k	blackburn, just looking at their github site - JUnit has 134 issues... more than we can ever have

@sonney2k	blackburn, I actually don't care so much... in python we just import all the *.py files
@sonney2k	and then run the tests
@sonney2k	blackburn, what I don't know is if one can serialize objects in java without deriving from some base class
@sonney2k	I wouldn't really like making the examples even more difficult
 blackburn	Serializable is interface IIRC
@sonney2k	blackburn, ok so it is not that bad one just writes implements Serializable right?
 blackburn	sonney2k: base class Test implements Serializable, that's all
 blackburn	why it could be bad? it is ok for me ;)
@sonney2k	blackburn, wait does mean the generator can do this or has this to be done in the examples?
 blackburn	sonney2k: in examples we have to have some base class where IO operations will be implemented
 blackburn	sonney2k: when in generator we could just readObject and writeObject
 blackburn	without any care
@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but that makes examples harder to read
 blackburn	why?? examples will stay simple
@sonney2k	didn't you say we need to write some io operations?
 blackburn	sonney2k: only in base class
 blackburn	or even without it
@sonney2k	so you would derive each example from that base class
 blackburn	yes
@sonney2k	I would love to not have to do that though
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	would be great if examples could stand alone
 blackburn	what do you mean saying alone?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no dependencies
@sonney2k	and if then only for loading data
 blackburn	all examples could implement that run() and have main for case it is run with java -jar someExample
 blackburn	dependencies from?
 blackburn	Test base class is much simpler for generator
 blackburn	it just load it and doing all the things that lovers do
 blackburn	well really we can implement run everywhere
 blackburn	almost the same
* blackburn is implementing heap for shogun
 f-x	sonney2k: are you there?
