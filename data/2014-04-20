@wiking	thoralf: i've messed up the coverity scan config :(
@wiking	thoralf: the problem is that SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED is actually not a function
@wiking	thoralf:  so it's being intiated by SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
@wiking	nothing like SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED("blablabla")
@wiking	or at least SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED()
 shogun-buildbot	build #263 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/263  blamelist: Fernando Iglesias <fernando.iglesiasg@gmail.com>, Abhijeet <abhijeetkislay@gmail.com>
@wiking	but you've defined void SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED(...) in the model file
@wiking	so we need to fix this somehow to have a proper analysis
@wiking	maybe if i do a define like: #define SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED()
@wiking	but i'm not so sure how that would work out exactly... i guess it could work...
 pl8787_	how to install shogun for python3
@wiking	pl8787_: on our buildbot it's done like this: cd build && cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON -DPythonModular=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python3
@wiking	and check this doc as well https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/doc/md/README_cmake.md
@wiking	(last line)
@wiking	i.e. read the manual
