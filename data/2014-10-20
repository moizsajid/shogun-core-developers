 honeybyte	Hello everyone
 honeybyte	I was just trying to use shogun to build a simple program - init_shogun and exit_shogun , the one shown in developer modules
 honeybyte	then, on entering g++ -lshogun minimal.cpp -o minimal
 honeybyte	It is not able to include the shogun headers in the file
 honeybyte	I also did make install, so -lshogun should have worked
 honeybyte	1 more surprising thing is that my build folder is empty !
 honeybyte	How should I correct it ?
