 kislay	hey jiaolong , you mean to say to put the links of multiclass classifier in the visual categorization notebook..right
 kislay	just the links or a bit description...just asking :)
 jiaolong	kislay: Hi, yes, it is just my opinion. I think maybe some people want to see more options than one-vs-all SVM and KNN. :)
 kislay	yeah
 kislay	thats for sure.
 jiaolong	kislay: You have done a nice job!
 kislay	thanks :)
 kislay	hey, you have a cv background right?
 jiaolong	kislay: I am doing PhD on CV
 kislay	woah!!!
 kislay	super cool
 jiaolong	kislay: On detection
 kislay	actually needed some help here http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/kislayabhi/0cc4f6e6b625873c15de
 jiaolong	kislay: But recently, mainly on domain adaptation
 kislay	cool man :)
 jiaolong	kislay: Yeah, I have also checked, looks very nice!
 kislay	actually, I need to use more shogun there
 kislay	any ideas?
 kislay	currently I am only using PCA class there
 kislay	jiaolong, hehe...I aspire to become a researcher in CV one day :)
 jiaolong	kislay: Haha, you have done a lot on CV. You will do a good job on CV, I believe. For Active Appearance Models, I am not so familar and I also need to learn more about shogun.
 kislay	okay.
 kislay	thanks for the evaluation.
 jiaolong	kislay: Maybe you can read some state-of-the-art paper and then look the usefull tools in shogun

 jiaolong	kislay: You are welcome! :)
 kislay	The AAM paper I was following got a bit nasty after building the combined model.
 kislay	they were using a steepest descent algo for fitting and searching the AAM model.
 kislay	anyways..I will figure out something.

@thoralf	Hey.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Hello
@thoralf	Hey jiaolong:)
 jiaolong	thoralf: How are you?
 jiaolong	thoralf: Do you have time to help me check this PR? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/2490
@thoralf	I'm fine.
@thoralf	Of course.  Let me check.
 jiaolong	thoralf: The python module has some problem.
 jiaolong	thoralf: After compiling and installing, pythom module doesn't work.
 jiaolong	thoralf: I have discussed with Fernando, but it seems the problem is not because of the testsuite.

@thoralf	jiaolong: Okay, what's the problem with this PR?  Can you give me a quick heads up?
 jiaolong	thoralf: I found python module not working after adding some functions
 jiaolong	thoralf:but the compiling python module is fine
@thoralf	Ah, I see your gist.

 jiaolong	thoralf: For example,  aftering compiling and installing, I tried "from modsogun import Factor" in ipython and it failed
 shogun-buildbot	build #851 of FCRH - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/FCRH%20-%20libshogun/builds/851  blamelist: Sergey Lisitsyn <lisitsyn.s.o@gmail.com>, khalednasr <k.nasr92@gmail.com>
@thoralf	jiaolong: For me it looks like your installation is incomplete.  Did you try removing *all* installed library versions (libshogun, python interface, etc.)?
@thoralf	Maybe you messed up your installation and now have libshogun and interfaces from different compilation runs?
 jiaolong	thoralf: I then removed some functions and everything is fine
@thoralf	Let me check the travis build.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Thanks!
@thoralf	Was travis green before your PR?
 hushell	jiaolong: one tip: build once without python_modular and install
@thoralf	i.e. are all errors yours? ;)
 hushell	then build again with python
* thoralf would just try a clean checkout.
@thoralf	There are still some files that are created in the original source tree and not in the build directory.
@thoralf	Maybe it's related.
@thoralf	But if Travis errors is all yours, then I guess clean build won't help. ;)
 hushell	so, now errors are all in Travis, or also in your local?
 hushell	sorry I didn't follow your conversation before
 jiaolong	thoralf: Travis was green before my PR
@thoralf	collect2: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed]make[2]: *** [src/shogun/libshogun.so.16.1] Error 1
 jiaolong	thoralf: the error is from my newly added functions
@thoralf	Okay.
 jiaolong	hushell: error is from my  local
 hushell	alright, I'll also pull your branch
 jiaolong	hushell: I am gradually adding the functions, so far it is fine
 jiaolong	hushell: I think I will soon locat the problematic function :)
 jiaolong	hushell: locate
 hushell	jiaolong: yeah, the lib stuff is painful
@thoralf	Problem in Travis is this fucntion: shogun::SGNDArray<float>::operator*=(float)
@thoralf	Have you ever tried using the tool "c++filt"?
@thoralf	It can be used to demangle the C++ names you get in linker errors.
@thoralf	echo "_ZN6shogun9SGNDArrayIfEmLEf" |c++filt
@thoralf	Did you implement SGNDArray<float>::operator*=(float)?
 jiaolong	thoralf: Thank you very much! I have never used this tool.
 jiaolong	thoralf: Yes, I implemented
@thoralf	I only see double.
 jiaolong	thoralf: sorry, I only implemented float64_t
 jiaolong	thoralf: But I just enabled this function and python module can be generated correctly
@thoralf	Maybe somebody implicitly tried to instanciate SGNDArray<float>?
@thoralf	I guess implementing *= will fix this error. ;)
 jiaolong	thoralf: OK, thank you so much. I will focus on this function and see if I can  fix it.
