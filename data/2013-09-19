 sonne|work	wiking:
 sonne|work	(09:35:38 PM) sonney2k: wiking, you might consider turning of integration tests on travis IMHO it is sufficient that we run this stuff on the buildbots
 sonne|work	(09:36:21 PM) sonney2k: wiking, I mean travis is good to get a rough picture if sth works and IMHO that is all we want at this stage leaving detailed analysis to our own BB
 sonne|work	^ any comments?
 sonne|work	wiking: /home/buildslave/nightly_none/build/tests/unit/multiclass/BaggingMachine_unittest.cc:25:45: error: 'class testing::NiceMock<shogun::MockCFeatures>' has no member named 'ref'
 sonne|work	 on nightly_none
 wiking	yesh i know
 wiking	sonne|work: we can disable integration on travis
 wiking	that's no problem
 wiking	currently i'm fixing leaking errors
 wiking	i think parametermap or such is leaking...

@iglesiasg	good morning!
-!- lisitsyn [~lisitsin@mxs.kg.ru] has joined #shogun
 wiking	iglesiasg: yo! need help
 wiking	iglesiasg: StructuredLabels unit test is indicating a lot of leak :(
@iglesiasg	wiking, shit, that's not good
@iglesiasg	wiking, do you have the trace?
 wiking	iglesiasg: i can copy paste
 wiking	just a sec
 wiking	iglesiasg: http://pastebin.com/38xthspY
@iglesiasg	wiking, there are also leaks coming from init_shogun_with_defaults
@iglesiasg	wiking, that looks weird to me
 wiking	iglesiasg: dont bother about that now
 wiking	iglesiasg: the lot of parameterMap leak is just beecause there's an objec that is not being freed
@iglesiasg	wiking, it leaks because the test is wrong I think
@iglesiasg	wiking, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/tests/unit/labels/StructuredLabels_unittest.cc#L49
@iglesiasg	get_label returns an object, but there is no SG_UNREF for them
 wiking	iglesiasg: fixit plz
 wiking	if u can
@iglesiasg	thoralf, ^
@iglesiasg	wiking, yep. I can do that right away
 wiking	cool thanx heaps
@iglesiasg	wiking, will need to compile in debug to double check so will take a few minutes..
 wiking	yeps... thnx
 wiking	i'm fixing some other shit in the meanwhile..
@iglesiasg	wiking, it should be ready, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1627
 wiking	ok i'll pull it
 wiking	as soon as i have my fixes ready as well
@iglesiasg	all right
 wiking	thnx a lot
@iglesiasg	no fixes were left here
@iglesiasg	so actually the ones in init_shogun_with_defaults were also a consequence of these ones
@iglesiasg	sorry
@iglesiasg	no leaks were left
 sonne|work	wiking: I have a hard time debugging cyg1 and other crashers. Could we when a test fails run it with the gdb script in .src again to get a proper bt?
 wiking	sonne|work: i'll try to see if i can do something about that
@iglesiasg	speaking of which, cygwin is still the only way to install Shogun in Windows, right?
@iglesiasg	wiking, sonne|work, ^
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yes
@iglesiasg	just wondering since, IIRC, something was mentioned about native in Windows when CMake came
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: yeah sth to work on for later
@iglesiasg	I see
 wiking	iglesiasg: i've applied some changes
 wiking	iglesiasg: but more changes are required
 wiking	as msvc is not the most standard compiler
@iglesiasg	aham I understand
 wiking	ok finally i've found a valgrind error that is actually not a unit test leak but an actual leak in the library
@iglesiasg	wiking, StructuredLabels still?
 wiking	iglesiasg: nono
 wiking	when's the meeting today?
@iglesiasg	in one hour approx
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: we need some massive thing about __declspec(dllexport)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, for windows stuff?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: yeah
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I see
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: otherwise all the classes are not visible from .dll
@iglesiasg	I am not really interested in it myself (windows sucks :P) but I know a guy who might be interested
 lisitsyn	I don't know if there is other way
@iglesiasg	although it is true that this could help us reach more people
 lisitsyn	no we definitely need it
 lisitsyn	I don't want to hear about windows sucks ;)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, lol why not?
 lisitsyn	just like most of the people are idiots but we have to live with that
@iglesiasg	it is the truth!!
@iglesiasg	hahaha
 lisitsyn	the majority is windows so we have to live with that too
@iglesiasg	I like your pragmatism
 wiking	lisitsyn: MALSAR_unittest is leaking like hell :)
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, anyway, our users are developers as well. Do you still think windows is majority in that too?
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, I would say people using mac os or linux for development are more
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well remember that detection thing I develop
@iglesiasg	yep
@iglesiasg	windows people the ones who ask you to do that?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: it has to be windows
@iglesiasg	but run on windows or actually developed in windows?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I am deeply saddened ;)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: well run on windows
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, that's another thing :)
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: of course I can train on linux
 wiking	lisitsyn: plz fix
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah let me try

 lisitsyn	;)
 lambday	lisitsyn: sorry I am late
 HeikoS	lambday: hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: hey :)
 lisitsyn	np lambday thanks for joining us
 lisitsyn	lets just talk about each project one by one
 lisitsyn	and discuss what have been done
 lisitsyn	and what's you think is still left
 lisitsyn	are you ok with that?
 HeikoS	sure
 lisitsyn	and may be anybody would like to start?
 HeikoS	we can
 HeikoS	lambday: ?
 lisitsyn	just one note
 lisitsyn	please put an url with ipython notebook
 lambday	all the parts of my project has been implemented...
 shogun-buildbot	build #1497 of cyg1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/cyg1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1497  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 HeikoS	ok let me go ahead
@iglesiasg	(for some reason, I have very large  lag, so I might take time to answer -- sorry for that)
 HeikoS	so Rahul started with the notebook, the current draft is here
 HeikoS	http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6591994
 HeikoS	Still some things to improve and polish, but its getting there
 HeikoS	currently there is an issue wie complex typemaps in swig, which he is at
 HeikoS	python examples not there yet but are easy since its all subparts from the notebook
 HeikoS	lambday: what about the code-review? did you have a look on that?
 hushell	HeikoS: I just sent an email to lambday about the peer review
 lambday	HeikoS: hushell mailed me regarding this... I am thinking of doing it in the weekends
 hushell	lambday: hi!
 thoralf	Will something in the dev meeting be non-gsoc related?
 lambday	hushell: hey man! just replied to your mail.. :)
 wiking	thoralf: on the end
 lisitsyn	thoralf: yeah lets talk about it in the end
 wiking	thoralf: so take a coffee ;)
 hushell	lambday: good! :)
-!- georg_zeller [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS	ok so code review will be done last minute then, guys, please start this before Saturday and take some time
 lisitsyn	hey georg_zeller
 georg_zeller	hi and sorry for being late
 thoralf	Okay, please ping me.  My IRC client will wake me up then. :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: do we have review pairs anywhere around?
 lisitsyn	lambday is reviewing ..?
 lambday	HeikoS: alright...
 HeikoS	people should know, if not I will find them
 lambday	lisitsyn: hushell's
 lisitsyn	good
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@89.204.135.239] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	foulwall, you are my couple :P
 lisitsyn	okay so lambday
 HeikoS	van51 - gsomix hushell - lambday pickle27 - votjakovr iglesias - foulwall
 lisitsyn	what you might need to focus is polish ipython notebook
 lisitsyn	I don't think we need python examples right now
 wiking	lambday: and ping me on the end of the meeting plz
 HeikoS	ehm the split is not the minus but the " "
 lambday	lisitsyn: yes alright
 lambday	wiking: sure :)
 HeikoS	yeah notebook is more important than python examples
 lisitsyn	notebook seems more important
 wiking	notebook++
 HeikoS	but writing examples takes just one day both libshogun and notebook,
 lambday	plus python examples won't take more than an hour once the notebook is complete
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	you need to resolve that issue
 HeikoS	@all In general, notebooks should explain more things, keep in mind that people reading them might not know what you are doing there :)
 lisitsyn	and code-review
 HeikoS	yep agreed!
 lambday	lisitsyn: yeah swig is giving me real pain :'(
 wiking	lambday: just ask here
 HeikoS	lambday: if this takes too long, maybe postpone the complex stuff and finish the rest first
 wiking	lambday: we've fixed the other day the bug we had with r modular...
 HeikoS	lambday: its just a small subset of your work
 lambday	wiking: alright let's talk about the swig thing in the end..
 lisitsyn	okay so lambday's project is ok and we have no real issues
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah, so kept that part incomplete
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: want to continue with votjakovr?
 lambday	wiking: I saw, it was renaming afterall :)
 sonne|osx	lambday: just tell us what you need / where you have issues
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: okay
 sonne|osx	lambday: we will get it to work.
 wiking	lambday: indeed... but lets get back to this on the end... anyhow great work!
 lambday	sonne|osx: I need to make our complex64_t (std::complex<double>) with numpy complex64
 lambday	wiking: thanks man :)
 HeikoS	votjakovr: wanna give us the update?
 sonne|osx	lambday: should be easy to do :D
 sonne|osx	lambday: but later
 lambday	alright
 lambday	:)
 lisitsyn	oh okay so while votjakovr is afk
 lisitsyn	may be anyone else?
 HeikoS	votjakovr: sleeping? :)
 HeikoS	ok so let me do this
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oops :)

 HeikoS	ah
 lisitsyn	okay we have some issues here right?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: unfortunately my project is not ready yet :(
 votjakovr	model selection part is missing
 sonne|osx	votjakovr: and apart from that?
 lisitsyn	what can we do about it?
 HeikoS	votjakovr: if you cannot finish this today or latest tomorrow, we will have to postpone it, it is very important that the notebook and some examples are there
 votjakovr	i'll finish it today
 HeikoS	I mean, already you can write about a lot of things
 sonne|osx	HeikoS, votjakovr but the rest is 'done' ?
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: yeah if this is merged, the we can polish
 lisitsyn	lets just decide what is missing to consider the project done
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: wanted to do multiclass originally, but that is unrealistic
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: model-selection, notebook, examples
 lisitsyn	can we postpone examples already?
 HeikoS	lisitsyn: they are last in the list, but I think they are important
 HeikoS	but the notebook is more important
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: can you write some GP notebooks? IIRC you already have them?
 lisitsyn	I mean we are in difficult timing
 HeikoS	votjakovr: in fact I cal help you a bit with the notebook if that helps
 sonne|osx	then votjakovr can do the MS
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: yeah, I will start one, good idea
 HeikoS	votjakovr: do you agree? then you can focus on the modelselection
 HeikoS	votjakovr: but please hurry up a lot!
 lisitsyn	and code-review
 sonne|osx	votjakovr: but the agreement would be that you finish it then
-!- georg_zeller [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has quit [Quit: georg_zeller]
 votjakovr	actually i've started both of them (model-selection, notebook, examples)
-!- georg_zeller [~zeller@embln.embl.de] has joined #shogun
 HeikoS	votjakovr: pls send your current state then and I will push them a bit ok?
 lisitsyn	votjakovr: lets just assure both HeikoS and you mean the same
 sonne|osx	votjakovr: so what do you think? When would you finish?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i'll try to finish model-selection today
 lisitsyn	what's the worst estimate of that part?
 HeikoS	votjakovr: that would be good!
 votjakovr	examples toaday/tomorrow
 votjakovr	HeikoS: notebook takes some time
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: I would suggest to see how it goes. If MS is done by today or tomorrow everything will work out nicely.
 HeikoS	votjakovr: notebook first! Then examples
 HeikoS	examples are just demonstration of API
 sonne|osx	votjakovr: so do notebooks a little later and make sure to get some help from HeikoS
 HeikoS	notebook is about what is going on behind the scences and what you have done
 HeikoS	yep, votjakovr pls send the current state or even send a PR with it, then I can update
 HeikoS	as soon as you have *something* for the notebook, send it
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, i'll send little bit later
 lisitsyn	alright so I guess that's the plan?
 sonne|osx	looks like
 lisitsyn	votjakovr: please keep HeikoS updated
 votjakovr	lisitsyn: ok
 lisitsyn	so if you are stucked or whatever just let him know
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: next?
@iglesiasg	I am ready!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: georg_zeller please continue then
 sonne|osx	(it is already 12:28)
@iglesiasg	There is this notebook http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6576096 that currently contains a first section explaining what LMNN is, and a second section applying LMNN to a real data set illustrating feature selection.
@iglesiasg	I have to update this second part to use Shogun's cross validation, instead of how it is done at the moment.
 HeikoS	apologies, but I have to be AFK for a while, checking back later for non-gsoc stuff
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: yeah lets speed up
@iglesiasg	Then, I will add another data set in the notebook where I am comparing kNN and LMNN in a multiclass classification task. I will normalize and whiten the data for this task as we have discussed in the mailing list.
 lisitsyn	your notebook looks quite nice
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, thanks! :) I think it is pretty standard actually
 lisitsyn	georg_zeller: iglesiasg: so what do you think is left here?
@iglesiasg	oh! And I forgot, I have to update the first part too, showing some neighbourhood graphs
 georg_zeller	we have discussed a few updates on the notebook but those shouldn't take long
@iglesiasg	so basically updating the notebook with these things
 lisitsyn	ah yes
 lisitsyn	apart from that?
 georg_zeller	maybe 2-3 days I'd guess?
@iglesiasg	yep
@iglesiasg	georg_zeller, yes, I think so
@iglesiasg	then I have to do the code review
 lisitsyn	so nothing apart from that right?
 georg_zeller	coding is done as far as I'm concerned
 lisitsyn	yeah and the code review
@iglesiasg	but I hope to get that done in the weekend
 georg_zeller	what about examples?
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: I wouldn't mind if you could help us get the release polished
 lisitsyn	okay it looks healthy
@iglesiasg	georg_zeller, there are libshogun, octave and python examples already
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: you know website, bug and warning fixes etc
@iglesiasg	just simple stuff
 sonne|osx	helping out others...
 georg_zeller	then fine from my side
 wiking	sonne|osx: none gsoc related stuff on the end of this meeting :)
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, sure, once GSoC period is over I get to this
 lisitsyn	okay thanks a lot georg_zeller iglesiasg your project is totally ok :)
 wiking	sonne|osx: unfortunately lisitsyn mixed up monthly dev meeting with gsoc meeting...
 lisitsyn	next is sonne|work foulwall Cheng please
 lisitsyn	haha
 georg_zeller	we talked about a few interesting applications but better for the time after GSoC
 lisitsyn	well
 lisitsyn	georg_zeller: yeah it would be nice if you continue
 sonne|osx	wiking: no no that is not the issue
 georg_zeller	would be great for me too
 lisitsyn	wiking: lets say I combined meetings
 sonne|osx	wiking: we need help to get the release done so anyone who thinks his project looks OK please help us!
 lisitsyn	otherwise I seem stupid hahah
 wiking	lisitsyn: no u fucked it up ;)
 lisitsyn	wiking: tss
 wiking	okey continue
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: foulwall bitte
 wiking	Cheng foulwall sonne|osx
 wiking	speed it up
 wiking	the demo site just looks great
 sonne|osx	foulwall: ?
 lisitsyn	gsomix?
 gsomix	yep
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: gsomix bitte
 wiking	gsomix: let's talk
 gsomix	OK. I'm finishing protobuf support for shogun right now. For now we have simple IO system (buffered read, simple parsers), csv and libsvm readers.
 lisitsyn	schnelle
 lisitsyn	:D
 gsomix	After protobuf related works I'll start writing ipython notebook and nice examples.
 gsomix	Unfortunately support of matlab m-files and some `exotic' formats is out of schedule (*bad guy). But I'll stay with shogun for this work.
 sonne|osx	So whoever has a nice idea for a demo ask foulwall
 gsomix	Maybe Soeren want to say sth?
 lisitsyn	what's left with protobuf?
 sonne|osx	e.g. van51's language detection demo is now in applications
 wiking	gsomix: yeah those io stuff are great you've implemented... looking forward for the protobuf stuff
 sonne|osx	http://foulwall.com:8000/application/language_detect/
 sonne|osx	if you can think of sth like this for your project and need help from foulwall now would be the time
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: what's left?
 sonne|osx	well the splice site recognizer/arts detector
 sonne|osx	but it really is us that need to do sth here IMHO
 lisitsyn	that's out, right?
 gsomix	lisitsyn, today I'll send PR with skeleton. And then we need and protobuf support for many data types...
 gsomix	*need to add
 sonne|osx	gsomix: ok fine!
 sonne|osx	I will try to do the CR quickly
* gsomix *sigh*
 sonne|osx	I guess everyone here hopes that you can continue with .mat files
 foulwall	Hi, all . sorry for the network  latency
 sonne|osx	even psot gsoc
 sonne|osx	post
 gsomix	sonne|osx, of course.
 wiking	gsomix: cvmatio... have you seen that project?
 gsomix	wiking, nope. we plan use some code from octave.
 wiking	gsomix: it's binding opencv stuff to .mat files: github.com/hbristow/cvmatio
 gsomix	but OK, I'll see. thanks!
 wiking	gsomix: it's pretty small and easy to port stuff that you need from there
 sonne|osx	gsomix: that would work as well. but it is matlab 5 only not the new 7.3 format
-!- foulwall [~AndChat63@219.141.159.55] has quit [Quit: Bye]
 sonne|osx	wiking: makes sense to use it!
 wiking	sonne|osx: works fine with newer matlab stuff
 gsomix	cool!
 wiking	sonne|osx: i mean the one i've sent just now
 sonne|osx	wiking: most certainly not!
-!- foulwall [~AndChat63@219.141.159.55] has joined #shogun
 wiking	sonne|osx: ?
 wiking	sonne|osx: i'm using matlab 2012 and i can read those .mat files with this :)
 sonne|osx	wiking: ohh you are right
 sonne|osx	man I had an old link
 sonne|osx	https://github.com/hbristow/cvmatio
 wiking	sonne|osx: CVMATIO implements a Matlab v7 MAT file parser in C++, giving users the
 sonne|osx	gsomix: this will be of great help then
 wiking	ability to interact with binary MAT files in their own projects.
 wiking	;)
 foulwall	Hi all, sorry  for the  disconnect.
 wiking	so go ahead and have fun with it...
 sonne|osx	gsomix: so it would be quite easy to do
 gsomix	sonney2k, wiking is super hero for me now. :)
 sonne|osx	alright then gsomix finish protobuf and then you can try this out :)
 wiking	foulwall: we are listening
 wiking	:>
 wiking	foulwall: great work with the demo site!
 sonne|osx	gsomix: alright then that's about it
 sonne|osx	next ?
 sonne|osx	or foulwall ?
 foulwall	Hi , I'm vsry happy to implement your ideas
 lisitsyn	sorry back
 lisitsyn	what's left in foulwall's project?
 sonne|osx	wiking: I still think it cannot do v7.3 (or4) formats though. But matlab 5 to 7.2 will work
 sonne|osx	gsomix: https://github.com/hbristow/cvmatio/blob/master/src/MatlabIO.cpp - really very little code
 foulwall	I'll make a more detailed docs, and make a python interface for the mldata hdf5 downloader
 wiking	sonne|osx: it has some extra stuff in the .hpp... but yeah it's about 2000 LoC
 wiking	tops
 foulwall	I'll make them before  the hard deadline
 wiking	sonne|osx: well it's better than nothing... :P
 sonne|osx	foulwall: I think the only missing stuff is arts/asp ?
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: do we have any example which we want to work interactively still?
 foulwall	Oh. forget to merge that, arts and asp pr will  send today
 wiking	sonne|osx: HeikoS is away atm
 sonne|osx	foulwall: ahh and the tree clustering but you have the tree already there so all that is needed is to call the hierarchical clustering example
 sonne|osx	wiking: we should put foulwalls demos live on fatbot
 sonne|osx	wiking: can we use your image for that?
 wiking	sonne|osx: why on fatbot?
 wiking	sonne|osx: but of course we can use that image...
 wiking	sonne|osx: i'll setup up the startup script for that image today... along with the ipython notebook server
 lisitsyn	okay so
 wiking	and then i can add as well the demo site
 sonne|osx	wiking: fast/big machine!
 wiking	sonne|osx: okok no worries
 lisitsyn	can we proceed?
 wiking	lisitsyn: yes who's next?
 lisitsyn	az_de: pickle27 and me
 foulwall	okey
 az_de	maybe I can continue
 lisitsyn	az_de: around
 lisitsyn	?
 az_de	ok,  I just repeat Kevins e-mail, that
 lisitsyn	az_de: yeah thanks
 az_de	"all of his code for GSoC has been pushed to GitHub and merged! "
 lisitsyn	az_de: we don't have anything left in the project, right?
 sonne|osx	foulwall: send a PR with arts/asp and then I show you how it works with hierarchical clustering (tomorrow?)
 wiking	az_de: that says everything great work from kevin! :)
 wiking	like his ipython notebook etc
 az_de	and he is now waiting for feedback ...
 sonne|osx	az_de: in this case can you involve him to help us with the release?
 foulwall	ok sonne|work
 az_de	yeah, The ipy-notebooks he created are really cool :-)
 lisitsyn	no he is not available I am afraid
 wiking	sonne|osx: i think he doesn't have much time (see that preproc email he sent)
 lisitsyn	he wanted to go travelling once gsoc is done
 sonne|osx	az_de: it will take time to get feedback from users. not before 3.0 I think
 sonne|osx	ahh too bad
 az_de	ok, I see
 wiking	but anyhow kevin did a great job
 wiking	he's gsoc project is totally ok
 wiking	imo
 az_de	All in all, we have a very successful GSoC project!
 wiking	yes, great work from all of you!
 az_de	There was a discussion to have some explicit whitening function in shogun, which is currently only implicitly done in some ICA methods.
 wiking	az_de: somebody will take over...
 az_de	Kevin has no time to do this now, but it should be straightforward .
 wiking	thanx a lot again!
 wiking	next?
 sonne|osx	yeah would be a nice preprocesor
 wiking	lisitsyn: who's next?
 sonne|osx	so thanks az_de for doing a great job with mentoring :)
 az_de	:-)
 wiking	az_de: yeah really super job !
 HeikoS	re
 wiking	HeikoS: great
 lisitsyn	wiking: thats only hushell left I think
 wiking	hushell: heheeey
 wiking	how's factor graph going along?
 wiking	i see a lot of discussion about the notebook
 wiking	what are the remaining issues?
 hushell	ok, let me start it
 hushell	not much to say, I have finished basic coding, the ipynb is here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6579472
 shogun-buildbot	build #15 of clang34 - static analysis is complete: Failure [failed analyse]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20static%20analysis/builds/15  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 wiking	hushell: ok cool how's the state of the notebook
 hushell	what left is some comparison between SOSVM solvers, I decided to postpone the BCFW solver after gsoc, before the hard deadline, I'll compare the primalMosek, dualBMRM and the coming subgradient descent one
 wiking	when is it going to be finalized?
 sonne|osx	hushell: incredibly cool!
@iglesiasg	hushell, btw, did you implement SGD finally?
 wiking	hushell: u should try various solvers of dualBMRM
 wiking	hushell: as there are  4 of them
 hushell	iglesiasg: I have finished the code of SGD
@iglesiasg	hushell, I thought you mentioned something about it in one of the discussions in github, but maybe I missed the PR
 wiking	hushell: it's easy to do that you just give the right enum for that...
 hushell	wiking: yeah, good idea, then there are more things to compare
 sonne|osx	hushell: so very well done
 wiking	hushell: go with the dualBMRM variants first... as mosek for example is not for free..
 wiking	hushell: and as well we can see how the various dualBMRM behaves with a real world problem...
 sonne|osx	yeah all non-free code is not so useful :/
 sonne|osx	and we cannot automatically test it
 hushell	I found mosek stuff are not in documentation
 sonne|osx	so it will die out anyway
 wiking	hushell: yeah as it's non-free.... as said go with the other SOSVM solvers...
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: what was that with the interactive stuff? (later)
 hushell	wiking: okay, then compare all BRRM solvers and the SGD
 wiking	hushell: which is at the moment DUALBMRM... CCSOSVM needs more love from svmlight ;P
 wiking	hushell: yeah that's good
 hushell	I'll done this by Friday
 wiking	ok any more issues?
 wiking	or stuff you need help with?
 hushell	yeah, one question about the dataset
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: anything we still want to run interactively as demo that would need extra work from foulwall?
 wiking	hushell: shoot go ahead
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-211-149-66.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has joined #shogun
 travis-ci	[travis-ci] it's Viktor Gal's turn to pay the next round of drinks for the massacre he caused in shogun-toolbox/shogun: http://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/11543374
-!- travis-ci [~travis-ci@ec2-54-211-149-66.compute-1.amazonaws.com] has left #shogun []
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: ah ok, not really for GSoC, but I hope it is easy to do these things myself and its well documented
 lisitsyn	okay so gsoc-wise
@iglesiasg	hushell, if you can use matlab, basically load the .mat file and then use the function csvwrite
 hushell	so if I have a cell array, is it possible to write it into csv, and read it from python?
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: wanted to pimp the GP stuff a bit mote (regression heatmaps etc) but no time for this now
 wiking	hushell: csv u can read from python w/o any problems...
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: well you should do it now - otherwise you will never realize if there are issues
@iglesiasg	hushell, what do you have in this cell array?
 lisitsyn	just a general thing - don't bother with code submission for now
 shogun-buildbot	build #8 of debian wheezy - memcheck is complete: Failure [failed memory check]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/debian%20wheezy%20-%20memcheck/builds/8  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
 hushell	iglesiasg: just many matrix
 sonne|osx	HeikoS: I mean realize when it is too late
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: the model-selection is not yet working, but it would be nice to have a button for that
 sonne|osx	hushell: I sse
 sonne|osx	* see
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: thats why I say that there should be very good documentation of the framework
 hushell	each cell is a matrix
 sonne|osx	hushell: maybe we just use a .mat for now
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: if no-one can edit it after foulwall left, that is of no use
 wiking	sonne|osx: hushell go with .mat
 hushell	so with scipy.io is more convenient
 wiking	sonne|osx: and i'll help out gsomix with .mat reader
 sonne|osx	I don't think it is easy to convert that to a .csv
 sonne|osx	it needs a custom format
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: I will have a look later, its not possible before GSoC end since I want to help my guys a bit
 wiking	hushell: don't waste time on this...
 hushell	sonne|osx: yeah, because I don't want to do the train-test splitting in python
-!- thoralf [~thoralf@enki.zib.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
 hushell	okay
 hushell	I'll try to improve the dataset later
 sonne|osx	hushell: that is the easiest. anyway just do it
 foulwall	HeikoS , I'll be very careful writting the docs of the framework
 sonne|osx	with .mat
 wiking	just go ahead with .mat and forget the rest...
 wiking	cool
 wiking	hushell: thanks a lot for the work
 wiking	great job!
 sonne|osx	so we are done with the summaries?
 wiking	any of the gsoc students... if u get stuck plz mail shout here on irc for help
 wiking	dont waste your time on things alone..
 hushell	Thanks for help! :)
 wiking	*all* ^
 wiking	cool
 wiking	sonne|osx: yeah it's done
 sonne|osx	So Sept 16 is suggested pencils down
 sonne|osx	err 23
 lisitsyn	no
 HeikoS	no 23 is hard
 lisitsyn	sept 16 is suggested
 lisitsyn	23 is hard
 sonne|osx	(well the hard pencils down)
 wiking	ok
 sonne|osx	we will then again have to do evaluations
 sonne|osx	and we should do them by Sept 25
 sonne|osx	students bug your mentors!
 HeikoS	otherwise no money ;)
 georg_zeller	alright date's saved
 sonne|osx	yeah and HeikoS no summit :D
 shogun-buildbot	build #3 of clang34 - undefined behaviour analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20undefined%20behaviour%20analysis/builds/3  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@iglesiasg	haha
@iglesiasg	HeikoS, bug mentors you too!!
@iglesiasg	:D
 HeikoS	haha
 HeikoS	can do :)
 sonne|osx	Alright - this cannot be repeated often enough.
 sonne|osx	We are very happy with the work you have all done.
 sonne|osx	And it would be very cool if you would stay post-gsoc and do cool stuff with shogun.
 georg_zeller	great work from everyone indeed! Impressive!
 HeikoS	Yep, incredible results this GSoC. I am sure this will get a lot of attention
 sonne|osx	As you know we plan to do a shogun 3.0.0 release just once gsoc is over.
 wiking	yeah plz hang around
 sonne|osx	So all your work will be included and it would be *great* if you could help us fixing bugs/warnings etc.
 hushell	very exciting about the 3.0.0!
 wiking	ookeeeeey
 HeikoS	We probably will need a bugfix/cleanup release 3.1 later this year where we fix all problem that people found in 3.0 :)
@iglesiasg	I was in a similar situation last year, I cannot do other thing but strongly suggest to keep hanging around and collaborate
 wiking	3.0.0 time!
@iglesiasg	it cannot be of course at the same pace as during GSoC, we all have other stuff to do
 wiking	agenda for that
 sonne|osx	Indeed 3.0 means we doubled shoguns code base since the last release
 wiking	1) fix fix fix
 wiking	2) fix fix fix
 wiking	:>
 lisitsyn	haa this means
 wiking	okey so i need some help here
 lisitsyn	with 5.0 we will get unmaintanable software
 lisitsyn	:D
 wiking	we are having a lot of leaks atm
 wiking	and a lot of undefined behaviour and a lot of static analyzer errors
 wiking	so
 sonne|osx	lisitsyn: you forget wikings botnet
 wiking	now comes the prio list
 HeikoS	wiking: maybe we should have a  priority list for the release? checking all issues for 3.0
 sonne|osx	yeah as wiking said
 lisitsyn	sonne|osx: well it could help to ddos NSA
 lisitsyn	but not to maintain ;)
 wiking	so HeikoS it's just coming now
 sonne|osx	http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/waterfall
 wiking	so please pleaaaase
 wiking	before doing anything try to do this first
 sonne|osx	fix bugs / failed tests
 sonne|osx	warnings
 wiking	HeikoS: for you the list:
 sonne|osx	for example these http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-19-1/
 HeikoS	ok so first goal is to make all builds work I guess?
-!- lambday [67157e37@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.126.55] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 sonne|osx	yeah we are trying this for a long time already...
 sonne|osx	but we are close (only cygwin fails basically)
 wiking	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1574 evaluation_cross_validation_multiclass base_load_file_parameters /base_load_all_file_parameters  aaadn all the errors at static analyzer for  /base /Parameter.cpp (http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-19-1/)
 wiking	HeikoS: and there are some stuff about *MMD
 sonne|osx	and the rest is bugs from static analyzers
 wiking	sonne|osx: yeah not always...
 HeikoS	wiking, alright I will do those things first and then get back
 wiking	sonne|osx: most of the time actually not but
 wiking	even if it is
 wiking	one can silence it with an assert or so
 sonne|osx	well stuff we should fix but it is not prime importance
 hushell	iglesiasg: then I'll have another PR for the SGD on Friday, will you have time to have a short review?
 wiking	HeikoS: especially start with https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/1574
@iglesiasg	hushell, sure, thank you!
 wiking	i need this fixed asap...
 sonne|osx	we need debian packages, besser82 is doing fedora packages
 HeikoS	kk
 sonne|osx	and we need osx packages
 sonne|osx	etc
 wiking	HeikoS: because it silences other warnings from other modules...
 wiking	*all* of you
 HeikoS	ah thats annoying
 wiking	who are doing release: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-19-1/
 besser82	sonne|osx: aren't you the DD? ;)
 wiking	try to at least silence it
 hushell	iglesiasg: as Patrick suggested, I should check the objective values, slack variables, should be the same as his matlab code, this will take a lot of time
 wiking	lisitsyn: i gave you your malsar leaks...
 wiking	lisitsyn: and fix the dead assigments here: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/static_analysis/2013-09-19-1/
@iglesiasg	hushell, I understand
 lisitsyn	wiking: yeah ok
 wiking	for all the tapkee related stuff
 hushell	iglesiasg: but I'll try to fix this by Friday, we have code review in the weekend
 sonne|osx	besser82: sure sure but I need to sleep too :D
 hushell	iglesiasg: thanks in advance! :)
@iglesiasg	hushell, but it will be so cool to have SGD working good
 besser82	sonne|osx: sleep? Who needs that? :-P
 wiking	current leak xml: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/memcheck/20130919-1012/DynamicAnalysis.xml
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: I still hope you do the website so we have the notebooks displayed nicely
 wiking	basically there's still tons of them there
 hushell	iglesiasg: I hope it will be faster then cutting plane methods ;)
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, yes
 sonne|osx	and HeikoS you wanted to change the README to be a .md and to have links between the READMEs and INSTALLs
 hushell	okay, I'll go back to sleep, thank you guys!
 HeikoS	sonne|osx: yes I still want to
 sonne|osx	hushell: vojtech's stuff is *very* fast so I am not so convinced
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, after what wiking has done with the cloud notebooks thing it should be easy, right?
 sonne|osx	hushell: thanks everyone for attending
 wiking	iglesiasg: unrelated
 sonne|osx	hushell: and good night
 HeikoS	goood night :)
 wiking	iglesiasg: we need to statically show the notebooks somewhere...
 wiking	hushell: gnite
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: ?
 hushell	have a great day! guys!
@iglesiasg	ok, then I misunderstood the cloud notebooks thing
 wiking	iglesiasg: indeed
 sonne|osx	wiking: ?
 wiking	iglesiasg: cloud is for editing playing
@iglesiasg	wiking, oh yeah sure
 sonne|osx	well that is totally unrelated
 wiking	iglesiasg: but we still need to be able to statically show somewhere the notebooks
@iglesiasg	fuck I am stupid
 sonne|osx	iglesiasg: we need to display examples on the website
 wiking	iglesiasg: and it should be able to handle shogun versions
 sonne|osx	interactive demoing is sth else
 sonne|osx	and we have 2 parts here
@iglesiasg	the cloud thing is to offer like an ipython session with shogun installed
 sonne|osx	1) is foulwalls demos / apps
 wiking	iglesiasg: say "notebooks generated" with shogun 3.0, and then latest and shogun 2.0
 wiking	and such...
@iglesiasg	wiking, aham I see
 sonne|osx	2) is the notebooks ...
@iglesiasg	so there are a couple of parts here
@iglesiasg	one is to generate the notebooks periodically
 wiking	yes
 wiking	iglesiasg: that's done
@iglesiasg	save them
 sonne|osx	guys I have to get back to work
@iglesiasg	and put a link to them in the webpage
 sonne|osx	cu all
 wiking	iglesiasg: it needs integration now to the webpage
-!- sonne|osx [~sonne@89.204.135.239] has quit [Quit: sonne|osx]
@iglesiasg	sonne|osx, bye!
 wiking	iglesiasg: #1482
 wiking	#1481
 wiking	#1483
 wiking	that's all the issues here
@iglesiasg	wiking, mm ok. Is it basically about putting links in the webpage then?
 wiking	the notebook generation (nightly) is done
 shogun-buildbot	build #8 of clang34 - thread analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/8  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@iglesiasg	that sounds tooe asy
 wiking	iglesiasg: well not only that... somehow we need to be able to switch between versions
@iglesiasg	ok
 wiking	so like shogun 3.0
 wiking	and latest
 wiking	for the same notebook
@iglesiasg	but first things first probably
-!- lambday [67157c37@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.124.55] has joined #shogun
@iglesiasg	first I will aim at showing them generated for one version, and then extend to several versions
@iglesiasg	wiking, what do you think?
 wiking	lambday: i've told you about your mem leak.... please fix that before doing anything else...
 lambday	wiking: working on that
 wiking	iglesiasg: i'm fine with that
 wiking	lambday: great thnx...
 lambday	sorry I got dc.. power cut :(
 wiking	HeikoS: i think you should just define -1 enums and then do a default: SG_ERROR(...) in the switch branch :P
@iglesiasg	wiking, where are they currently generated? the notebooks
 wiking	iglesiasg: jsut a sec...
@iglesiasg	the idea is that they are in doc/notebooks/* without the output saved
-!- Cheng [73406f11@gateway/web/freenode/ip.115.64.111.17] has quit [Quit: Page closed]
@iglesiasg	so that must be executed somewhere and saved somewhere else with the output
@iglesiasg	wiking, sure
 wiking	iglesiasg: the nightly_default does that
 wiking	i mean execution + saving
@iglesiasg	ok
@iglesiasg	wiking, one question about the visualization
 wiking	iglesiasg: http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/nightly_default/builds/528/steps/notebooks/logs/stdio
 wiking	i'm just checking where's the output
@iglesiasg	wiking, are we aiming at basically providing links to nbviewer.ipython.org/****
 wiking	iglesiasg: no... we need to save it locally
 wiking	i mean the full thing
@iglesiasg	or have it rendered somewhere else?
 wiking	it should be fully rendered on our webpage imho
@iglesiasg	wiking, yep sure, the full thing saved locally
@iglesiasg	mmm I see rendered on our webpage
@iglesiasg	it is indeed possible because basically the notebook runs on the browser always
 wiking	iglesiasg: on shogun website server the notebooks are here

 wiking	i dont know if this helps you at allk
 wiking	iglesiasg: indeed it does: http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/ecg_sep.ipynb
@iglesiasg	cool!
@iglesiasg	that helps me for sure
 wiking	iglesiasg: so all the notebooks are saved there
 wiking	but these are the nightlies
@iglesiasg	wiking, but there is no output in there I think
 wiking	iglesiasg: http://shogun-toolbox.org/static/notebook/gp_regression.ipynb
 wiking	this one does for sure
 wiking	if u think one is missing something
 wiking	let me know
 wiking	and i'll fix it
@iglesiasg	wiking, yep
@iglesiasg	that one has the output
@iglesiasg	so first I have to investigate how to render the notebook from those urls
 wiking	lcoally
 wiking	if u need anything for that let me know
 wiking	i think we'll just do something like
 wiking	static/notebook/{RELEASE_VERSION}/
 wiking	for the various verions of the notebooks
@iglesiasg	make sense
 wiking	and then we'll do somehow the switching from the website...
@iglesiasg	sorry, what did you mean with locally just a minute ago?
 wiking	iglesiasg: basically what we need is somehow list the availble notebooks on the website
 wiking	and the somehow to be able to render it
@iglesiasg	agree
 wiking	list is easy from django i guess
 wiking	ls directory
 wiking	:P
 wiking	ok i have to take a break now
 wiking	ppl r waiting for me on lunch
@iglesiasg	hehe yeah
 wiking	bbl
 wiking	let me know if u need something from me
@iglesiasg	I will work on the rendering thing
 wiking	iglesiasg: afaik there's a python script for this ;)
 wiking	iglesiasg: within ipython notebook
@iglesiasg	it makes total sense
@iglesiasg	I was going to say that
 sonne|work	wiking: what is with videos?
@iglesiasg	that I bet there is something already to do it :)
 sonne|work	workshop videos I mean?
 wiking	iglesiasg: even more... i know that there is an option of ipython to generate a html
@iglesiasg	yeeah videoooooz
 wiking	iglesiasg: please find out the command and i'll make sure that you get the htmls generated
 wiking	sonne|work: will be ready by 3.0
 wiking	:D
 wiking	bbl ... ppl r really waiting for me..
 sonne|work	wiking: ohoh
 wiking	what?
 wiking	plz be fast
@iglesiasg	wiking, ok
@iglesiasg	go and have lunck now!
@iglesiasg	:D
 wiking	iglesiasg: "These notebooks are normal files that can be shared with colleagues, converted to other formats such as HTML or PDF, etc"
 wiking	so we can even put the pdf somewhere...
 wiking	anyhow as u can see it's possible
 wiking	it's just one ipython notebook command
@iglesiasg	yep
@iglesiasg	so the idea is to the nightly doing that as well, right?
@iglesiasg	generating the HTML

 wiking	back
@iglesiasg	wiking, found it out already
@iglesiasg	I just tested it
@iglesiasg	wiking, ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb
 wiking	iglesiasg: what's the command?
@iglesiasg	you get a nice notebook.html
 wiking	iglesiasg: it'll be the same name?
@iglesiasg	pandoc, among maybe other stuff, is required
@iglesiasg	yes
 wiking	iglesiasg: i guess it's not a selfcontained html
 wiking	but there are like images saved next to it
 wiking	or?
@iglesiasg	why not?
@iglesiasg	I just opened it in my browser
@iglesiasg	images and everything
@iglesiasg	yes, self contained
 wiking	iglesiasg: well i thought that the images are not within the html
 wiking	so they are in the html encoded base64?
@iglesiasg	wiking, they are encoded in the html
@iglesiasg	no idea what base
 wiking	lol
 wiking	ok lemme test it
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	PandocMissing: The command 'pandoc -f markdown -t html --mathjax' returned an error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory.
@iglesiasg	told ya
@iglesiasg	wiking, http://pastebin.com/yVdJ7mb3
@iglesiasg	wiking, tell me the base :P
 wiking	okey
 wiking	base64
 wiking	<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARwAAAETCAYAAADkork1AAAABHNCSVQICAgIfAhkiAAAAAlwSFlz
 wiking	...
@iglesiasg	yeah
@iglesiasg	I just realized...
 wiking	okeey so we need this pandoc installed on 7nn
 wiking	and then we are ready to go
@iglesiasg	didn't I mention before that I am stupid :P
 wiking	i'll add this into the ipython notebook generator script
@iglesiasg	wiking, cool
 wiking	and then basically in the same directory
 wiking	where the notebooks are
 wiking	the html is going to reside as well
 wiking	sonne|work: do i have sudo on 7nn? :D
 wiking	sonne|work: seems not... :(
@iglesiasg	no hurry
 wiking	iglesiasg: ok we'll have to wait till sonne|work installs pandoc on that machine. but anyhow we can assume that there's going to be the html files as well
@iglesiasg	I have to finish off my other LMNN stuff first anyway
@iglesiasg	wiking, sure
 wiking	iglesiasg: then basically what we need is to list the *.html files in that directory
 wiking	make a reference to them
@iglesiasg	yes
 wiking	and we are set
 wiking	i'll setup later the demo site on fatbot
 wiking	and then we'll figure it out how to integrate that into the website
@iglesiasg	okok
 lambday	wiking: seems like I fixed it.. for allocating the list of SGSparseVectors and SGSparseVectorEntry, if I use SG_CALLOC instead of SG_MALLOC, that fixes it
 wiking	lambday: lol?!
 lambday	so SG_CALLOC calls constructor for each one in the list while SG_MALLOC doesn't
 wiking	lambday: how is that possible...
 wiking	okeeey
 lambday	sonne|work: is that right?
 lambday	argh something went wrong again
 wiking	lambday: calloc and mallco should be the same
 wiking	apart from how the memory is initialized
 wiking	i mean in case of calloc it's full 0 in case of malloc it's random
 sonne|work	lambday: no SG_MALLOC should do that too
 lambday	checking more
 lambday	lol
 lambday	if I do this --->
 lambday	SGSparseMatrix<type> sm(size, size);
 lambday	and then sm.sparse_matrix=blah;
 lambday	it leaks
 lambday	but
 lambday	if I do SGSparseMatrix<type> sm;
 lambday	sm.sparse_matrix=...., sm.num_vectors=... sm.num_features=... its alright
 lambday	:-/
 lambday	sonne|work: is there a reason for this?? :(
 lambday	wiking: fixed it though..
 lambday	wiking: I was checking that particular test-case explicitely... if I want to run valgrind for all of the tests, what should I use? (sorry irc pms are not saved I completely forgot what you said :( )
 sonne|work	lambday: that is weird
 wiking	lambday:
 lambday	sonne|work: yes! :-/
 wiking	valgrind "-q" "--tool=memcheck" "--leak-check=yes" "--show-reachable=yes" "--workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes" "--num-callers=50" ./tests/unit/shogun-unit-test "--gtest_filter=SparseMatrixOperator.*"
 lambday	sonne|work: wait I'll show you a gist
 wiking	should show u if there's an error
 lambday	wiking: thanks a lot
 lambday	wiking: wait.. so I should use cmake using just -DENABLE_TESTING=ON and then run valgrind separately?
 wiking	yes
 lambday	wiking: thanks :)
 wiking	ok this is amaazing
 wiking	in multiclass machine refcount suddenly jumps up to 3 from 1
 wiking	:)
 wiking	sonne|work: do you know by heart how to setup a watchdog?
 wiking	in gdb

 lambday	HeikoS: hi
 lambday	HeikoS: do you think the PR containing 2 python modular examples are okay? I made the changes that you suggested
 lisitsyn	wiking: e.g. catch throw
 lisitsyn	catch File.hpp:175
 lisitsyn	iirc
 HeikoS	lambday:  did you already send?
 lambday	HeikoS: yes I updated earlier :)
 lambday	HeikoS: I want to send another PR with the sparse matrix leak thing
 lambday	I don't want it to get inside that PR :(
 lambday	wiking: running valgrind "-q" "--tool=memcheck" "--leak-check=yes" "--show-reachable=yes" "--workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes" "--num-callers=50" ./tests/unit/shogun-unit-test "--gtest_filter=SparseMatrixOperator.*" reports no leak, just normal gtest style output
 HeikoS	lambday:  sorry I totally forgot about that one, since travis failed back then
 HeikoS	lambday: let me check
 wiking	lisitsyn: nono i want to specify  a memory address where and if there's a change in it i want it to break :)
 lambday	HeikoS: np ! :)
 lambday	HeikoS: I also need some help with ozone mcmc
 HeikoS	lambday: problem is that the integration testts fail with this one
 HeikoS	I will merge, but pls fix them asap before doing anything else
 HeikoS	have a look at travis output

 HeikoS	yeah, thanks for figuring that out! :)
 lambday	still no idea why it was :-/
 lambday	yeah num_feature/num_vector thing was there but I was testing with a square matrix :-/
 lambday	it didn't cause anything
 wiking	lambday: ok great thnx for the fix!
 wiking	and the fast response
 lambday	wiking: np :)
 lambday	wiking: now you have to help me out with swig :(
 wiking	ah cool
 wiking	lemme check what could be done about that one
 wiking	basically u need a numpy complex64 <-> complex64_t mapping?
 wiking	right?
 lambday	wiking: yes... I want to use ComplexSparseMatrixOperator, which is CSparseMatrixOperator<complex64_t>
 lambday	and SGVector<complex64_t>
 wiking	okeeey
 lambday	wiking: I didn't add this template to modular interface yet, tried with a few things but didn't work
 wiking	i'll check how it can be done

 wiking	ok i see
-!- van51 [~van51@athedsl-409794.home.otenet.gr] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]

 wiking	ok so u need SGSparseMatrix<complex64_t> as well
 lambday	yes
 wiking	maybe SGMatrix<complex64_t> ?
 lambday	wiking: good to have, not urgent
 lambday	for my examples I'll just be using sparse ones

 wiking	sonne|work: is there a reason why we dont use https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/swig/numpy.i
 wiking	?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes it does not support all the data types shogun has - however we started with this one
 wiking	 :(
 wiking	sonne|work: i've just realised that we are actually copying back and forth values of an array
 wiking	i.e. sgvector -> numpy
 wiking	that's not a mapping but a copy
 wiking	or am i reading it wrong?
 sonne|work	wiking: yes we copy
 sonne|work	in all interfaces!
 wiking	sonne|work: isn't there a way to actually just map the memory?
 wiking	or the memory is totally differnt
 wiking	hence we cannot do it
 wiking	i mean the structure
 sonne|work	wiking: shogun objects destroy memory currently
 sonne|work	free I mean
 wiking	sonne|work: mmm you mean reference is not being hold on the modular interface side
 wiking	right?
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	and we free memory too
 wiking	mmmm
 wiking	how can a create a RealVector from numpy array?
 sonne|work	you cannot
 sonne|work	ohh no I think you can
 sonne|work	wiking: x=RealVector()
 sonne|work	x.set(numpy.array([1.,2,3]))
 wiking	ok
 wiking	doh
 wiking	SGVector<complex64_t> a;
 wiking	a[0] should work
 wiking	right?
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea
 wiking	lambday_: ?
 sonne|work	wiking: with float64_t for sure
 wiking	sonne|work:  yeah i know
 wiking	In [34]: x = ComplexVector()
 wiking	In [36]: a = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=complex)
 wiking	In [37]: x.set(a)
 wiking	this works
 sonne|work	but Idon't see why not
 wiking	but then i try
 wiking	x[0]
 wiking	In [38]: x[0]
 wiking	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 wiking	TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
 wiking	<ipython-input-38-1ae75c28907a> in <module>()
 wiking	----> 1 x[0]
 wiking	TypeError: 'ComplexVector' object does not support indexing
 sonne|work	ahh from python
 wiking	yeah
 sonne|work	no I guess it needs the inplace stuff gsomix was doing
 wiking	but there's a lot of things like this in SGVector.cpp
 wiking	define COMPLEX64_ERROR_NOARG(function) \
 wiking	SG_SERROR("SGVector::%s():: Not supported for complex64_t\n",\
 wiking	...
 sonne|work	wiking: yeah sure. some ops cannot be sanely defined with complex
 wiking	ok i think i need more work on this
 wiking	but then again
 thoralf	wiking: min/max/sort won't work with complex
 wiking	thoralf: i've seen that
 wiking	 [40]: x.vector
 wiking	Out[40]: <Swig Object of type 'std::complex< double > *' at 0x113039500>
 wiking	In [41]: x.vlen
 wiking	Out[41]: 3
 wiking	so it seems it is set...
 wiking	i need extra stuff in the typemapping
 wiking	i guess..
 wiking	but basic stuff is already ready :
 wiking	:P
 lambday_	wiking: hey
 wiking	lambday_: so you were working with SGVector<complex64_t> right?
 lambday_	wiking: didn't try with vector, was trying with sparse matrix
 lambday_	but I need vector too

 besser82	HeikoS: your ATLAS-problem btw is caused by a mad atlas-lib your admin brewed :(
@HeikoS	I like that  alot
@HeikoS	besser82: I got around that finally
@HeikoS	besser82: using your classic thing to compile shogun

@HeikoS	besser82: btw stripping libshogun did not make eigen3's sparse module faster
@HeikoS	They actually know that they are half as fast as choldmo
@HeikoS	d
@HeikoS	But installing cholmod on this cluster seems impossible, tried many things and failed. The admins also dont get it working
@HeikoS	so I guess i have to rely on eigen3

 van51	foulwall: hey!
 foulwall	Hey van51 :)
 van51	foulwall: could you take a look at : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun-demo/pull/24
 van51	foulwall: I'd like to know if you have a problem with disabling autoescaping
@iglesiasg	foulwall, so would it be good for you if I put all my code in another repository?
@iglesiasg	foulwall, I think it is probably the most comfortable option
@iglesiasg	foulwall, and you can just write comments in github
 foulwall	ok van51
@iglesiasg	foulwall, so I am checking how comments work in github
 foulwall	I have read hushell's suggestion, and it's ok without creating another repo.
@iglesiasg	foulwall, it seems it is not possible to comment in files directly but one can comment in commits
 foulwall	Ah, I forgot the comment,
@iglesiasg	foulwall, so I can do several commits
@iglesiasg	foulwall, one for the method itself, another one for some examples, etc
@iglesiasg	foulwall, and you can put particular stuff associated with a line or a method, etc in there
@iglesiasg	foulwall, and more general stuff in an issue
 foulwall	Thank you:)
 foulwall	That's pretty convenient
@iglesiasg	foulwall, awesome then
@iglesiasg	foulwall, are you ok doing the same for me to review your code?
 foulwall	I'll have a look at your repo. and for me, just shogun-demo? Maybe tommorrow after I update the asp/arts demo and hierarchical clustering example?
@iglesiasg	foulwall, aaah true you worked in another repo
@iglesiasg	foulwall, so basically all your work is in shogun-demo?
@iglesiasg	or should I also look at something in shogun-web?
 foulwall	iglesiasg: All my work are wiped out from shogun-web

 votjakovr	HeikoS: hi! build_parameter_dictionary() method of SGObject now add to dictionary only exact parameters (not SGObject). GradientEvaluation class builds dictionary of current differentiable function lazy. Is it ok?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: hi!
@HeikoS	votjakovr: is that in your fork?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: can I have a look?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: seems ok to me, but I am not sure whether I completely get it
 votjakovr	HeikoS: sorry not yet
@HeikoS	so let me understand that
@HeikoS	before, the parameter dictionary contained SGOjects?
@HeikoS	and now?
@HeikoS	lazy dictionary building is OK
 votjakovr	HeikoS: contains only exact paramters
@HeikoS	what does that mean?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: are there any problems that this might cause?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: for example "sigma" of GaussianLikelihood
@HeikoS	ah
@HeikoS	yeah thats ok for now
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I mean if it causes problems we have to think about it more carefully later
@HeikoS	but now the focus is on finishing

@iglesiasg	wiking, but the test does not fail anyway?
@iglesiasg	funny
 wiking	iglesiasg: well it's an alignment issue

 wiking	HeikoS: i have now sgvector<complex> sgmatrix<complex> sgsparsevector<complex> and sgsparsematrix<complex>
@HeikoS	wiking: not really, but basically he needs shogun's complex64 to numpy complex
@HeikoS	and this for SGVector, SGSparseMatrix
 wiking	ok
 wiking	let's hope that this is what he needs
 wiking	and that it works
@HeikoS	sparse vector is a good idea, but I dont htink he uses that
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah :)
 wiking	i've tested sgvector
 wiking	that works nicely
 wiking	for the others i need some examples to test
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i think it's not really good
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but disabling parameters just for GPs is neither
@HeikoS	people wont be able to do grid-search for them
@HeikoS	votjakovr: also, these are discrete parameters so no derivative will ever be able to be computed
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and for this, we cannot kick them out
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah unfortunately
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so maybe a call by reference paramter which is a boolean flag which tells you whether its possible to compute the derivate?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: but we could add something like GRID_SEARCH_AVALIABLE ?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and its false by default, only true if there is an implementation
@HeikoS	yeah something like this
@HeikoS	but I would rather go for GRADIENT available
@HeikoS	since grid-search is more general
 votjakovr	HeikoS: oops yeah
 votjakovr	HeikoS: so they should be registered like: SG_ADD(..., GRADIENT_SEARCH_AVALIABLE), right?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: mmmh
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I dont like explicit things
@HeikoS	since then people have to register them with gradient AND implement gradient function
@HeikoS	rather have a gradient function that tells you NO, and then devs might overload it to say YES, HERE IS YOUR GRADIENT

@HeikoS	votjakovr: I dont get that, could you explain again?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: for example i get GaussianKernel and i'd like to build parameter dictionary, which contains only the parameters which we can use, when we want to compute derivative ("width" parameter in this case). How is it better to do this?
 shogun-buildbot	build #104 of precise - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/precise%20-%20libshogun/builds/104  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I see
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so there are two problems:
@HeikoS	1) is the parameter continous
@HeikoS	2) if yet, is the derivative implemented
@HeikoS	if 1) is false, you dont ask for derivative
@HeikoS	if you ask for derivative 2), then it might not be implemented
@HeikoS	votjakovr: so what about saying that every float parameter can have derivatives
@HeikoS	votjakovr: this is the only thing that makes sense, 1) is solved
@HeikoS	for 2) we need some mechanism that a class knows which derivatives it offers
@HeikoS	but I would like to not do this via the SG_ADD macro
@HeikoS	but rather by a local map in CSGObject
@HeikoS	or even better
@HeikoS	something that automagically says YES if a method is implemented
@HeikoS	so that in order to add a derivate, you only have to implement/overload a method
 votjakovr	HeikoS: we have just one method
 votjakovr	HeikoS: which gets parameter as argument
 votjakovr	HeikoS: and returns derivative wrt given parameter
 votjakovr	if there is no derivatives wrt given parameter it shows an error
@HeikoS	votjakovr: what about a flag in that method then?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: std implementation returns "empty derivative" and set the flag to false
@HeikoS	if a dev overloads, it returns the real derivate and sets flag to true

@HeikoS	this way, you can just check whether the derivative exists via trying to compute it
@HeikoS	the only downside is that you always have to compute the derivative if you just want to know whether thats possible. But that should not be a problem
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i actually don't need to check
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i need the parameters
 votjakovr	HeikoS: to build a dictionary
@HeikoS	votjakovr: ah so you just need to know the parameters that offer a derivative?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	votjakovr: mmh, so this cannot be solver via overloading the method then
@HeikoS	votjakovr: needs to be set by hand
@HeikoS	so a subset of the modelselection parameters would have also to be derivative parameters
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yeah
@HeikoS	votjakovr: what about adding another Parameter instance to CSGObject then?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: or in fact, maybe even your flag in SG_ADD
@HeikoS	votjakovr: would there be any other cases?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: that what i suggested :)
@HeikoS	because we dont want to pollute the SG_ADD too much
@HeikoS	most classes wont have derivatives
 votjakovr	HeikoS: SG_ADD(..., GRADIENT_SEARCH_AVAILABLE)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I think another Parameter instance would be best
@HeikoS	votjakovr: no, too much writing and most classes dont have this
@HeikoS	mmmh
@HeikoS	sonney2k: thoughts on this?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: macros do not support default arguments right?
@HeikoS	since I dont want t rouch all SG_ADD lines in shogun
 votjakovr	HeikoS: unfortunately
@HeikoS	only the ones where a derivative is there
@HeikoS	sonne|work: thoughts on this? ^
@HeikoS	votjakovr: mmh tough decision
@HeikoS	votjakovr: wait
@HeikoS	if you just want to know which parameters are continous, you are just interested in those which potentially can have derivatives right?
@HeikoS	*potentially*
@HeikoS	but the impleentation still can throw an error
@HeikoS	you just have to implement it if you want to do gradient model-selection
@HeikoS	so all float* parameters could be added,
@HeikoS	so maybe its possible to add a method to CSGObject that tells you the parameters that are continous?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: and the othher possibility would be to actually let the user provide a parameter tree with the parameters
@HeikoS	votjakovr: time is tight, maybe we should go with this solution for now, its ugly, but the other thing takes too long
@HeikoS	votjakovr: your problem is solved if users explicitly provide parameters for gradient search right?
@HeikoS	you can add the other thing later maybe?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: i need to build dictionary anyway
 votjakovr	HeikoS: since gradient result is using it
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but cant you build it from a ModelSelectionParameter tree?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: why not to add m_gradient_parameters to SGObject?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: maybe you are right
 votjakovr	HeikoS: add third option GRADIENT_SEARCH_AVAILABLE
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but lets think about one thing first
 votjakovr	HeikoS: and if it is enabled we add parameter to m_parameters m_model_selection_parameters and m_gradient_parameters
@HeikoS	votjakovr: in fact, do it. Replace all SG_ADD calls in shogun with GRADIENT_SEARCH_AVAILABLE=false
@HeikoS	and then set it to true for the ones you want
@HeikoS	votjakovr: though a default argument would be better
@HeikoS	votjakovr: i.e. SG_ADD(bla, MS_NOT_AVAILABLE) and SG_ADD(bla, MS_NOT_AVAILABLE, GRADIENT_NOT_AVAILABLE) being equivalent
@HeikoS	so that one only has to explicitly say when one wants gradients
@HeikoS	agreed?
 votjakovr	HeikoS: yep
@HeikoS	votjakovr: I dont know if its possible to overload macros, but try, if not we have to add it to all SG_ADD for now
@HeikoS	and a third field in CSGObject
 votjakovr	HeikoS: ok, i think this is temporal solution, right? I mean, will we do some improvement of parameter and modsel in future?
@HeikoS	votjakovr: yeah, I still like to keep things as clean as possible since doing things later doesnt work most of the time ;)
@HeikoS	votjakovr: but go ahead
@HeikoS	this is a good solution in fact
@HeikoS	we just should think about ways of overloading the macro
 votjakovr	HeikoS: have a look: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8886812/overload-c-macros
@HeikoS	votjakovr: okay, if you can make this work, it would be great, but dont spend too mnuch time on macro magic ;)

 wiking	m_rescode = MSK_putavec(m_task, MSK_ACC_CON, con_idx, nnz+1,
 wiking	asub.vector, aval.vector);
 wiking	Replaces all elements in one row of A.?
@iglesiasg	ok it is a exercise of memory
* wiking is trying to update the interface for mosek
@iglesiasg	yes
@iglesiasg	it should do that
@iglesiasg	I am almost 90% confident it does that
 wiking	ok cool
@iglesiasg	wiking, new Mosek version?
 wiking	iglesiasg: yeah 7
 wiking	i'm now trying to find an equivalent of MSK_putaveclist
@iglesiasg	I am so looking forward to have some time and substitute that for another solver

@iglesiasg	when I talked to Nico in the workshop
@iglesiasg	he said it should be possible to do subgradient descent and use it instead of the Mosek solver we are using right now
@iglesiasg	wiking, do you think it makes sense too?
@iglesiasg	and I mean, gradient descent it is not hard. Even if Mosek solver is faster, it probably pays off just to get rid of this shit
 wiking	iglesiasg: Osi: https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi
 wiking	iglesiasg: it is interfacing a lot of solvers
 wiking	(mosek included)
@iglesiasg	wiking, LP
 wiking	mmm fuck it only interfaces LP
 wiking	no QP?
@iglesiasg	wiking, we are using mosek for a QP
@iglesiasg	they only mention LP so far
@iglesiasg	let me check
@iglesiasg	I think so, yeah
 wiking	https://projects.coin-or.org/OptiML
@iglesiasg	A'x=0
 wiking	http://www.coin-or.org/projects/
@iglesiasg	it is like libqp
 wiking	i'm just checking there what they have there
 wiking	seems like heaps of stuff
@iglesiasg	for the SO-SVM we need A'x<=b
@iglesiasg	okok
-!- lisitsyn1 [~lisitsyn@fb2-lo1.global63.net] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@iglesiasg	wiking, still. I think it might be good just to code up a solver for that
-!- besser82 [~besser82@fedora/besser82] has quit [Quit: freedom, friends, features, first ---> fedoraproject.org]
 wiking	 This routine finds a KT point for the Quadratic LCP (QP) problem
 wiking	19
 wiking	20c       minimize    f(x) = ct.x + xt.G.x/2
 wiking	21
 wiking	22c       subject to  l <= [I : A]t.x <= u
 wiking	oh come oon man
 wiking	this guy if fucking crazy
 wiking	he wrote this solver in fortran
 shogun-buildbot	build #10 of clang34 - thread analysis is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://buildbot.shogun-toolbox.org/builders/clang34%20-%20thread%20analysis/builds/10  blamelist: Viktor Gal <viktor.gal@maeth.com>
@iglesiasg	haha
@iglesiasg	wiking,  I never did fortran. Is it more hardcore than C?
@iglesiasg	I guess not
 wiking	it is fucking hardcore
@iglesiasg	I mean, it is not assembler, right?
@iglesiasg	wiking, have you seen our BMRM?
@iglesiasg	that is hardcore I think hehe
 wiking	iglesiasg: hehe no its cool
 wiking	i've even fixed some shit in it
 wiking	and then did some extension of it in libncbm
 wiking	:P
@iglesiasg	nice
 wiking	ok so i wonder what could be the replacement of that MSK_putaveclist
@iglesiasg	check for the methods to add constraints
@iglesiasg	it is basically that
@iglesiasg	linear inequality constraint
@iglesiasg	that's how they were called in Mosek's doc IIRC
 wiking	Changes the bounds of a list of constraints.
 wiking	?
 wiking	could it be this?
@iglesiasg	not really
@iglesiasg	A x <= b
@iglesiasg	that one you mention is to change the b, I think
 wiking	yes
 wiking	and u change with aveclist?
 wiking	x?
 wiking	i mean A's
@iglesiasg	no no
 wiking	row
@iglesiasg	yes yes
@iglesiasg	a row of A
@iglesiasg	wiking, do you have the doc page?
 wiking	ah and it replaces n number of elements
@iglesiasg	I can try to help to find it
 wiking	for the new api?
@iglesiasg	mm n number of elements
 wiking	http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/capi/Changes_and_new_features_in_MOSEK.html
@iglesiasg	so that method was done to dine a row of A
@iglesiasg	but you do it in a sparse way
@iglesiasg	so you give
@iglesiasg	1) the number of values in a row you want to change
@iglesiasg	2) the indices within the row, i.e. col idxs
@iglesiasg	3) the actual values
@iglesiasg	wiking,  http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/capi/MSK_putarow_.html?
@iglesiasg	wiking, to me it looks like it must be that one
@iglesiasg	wiking, now you have m_rescode = MSK_putavec(m_task, MSK_ACC_CON, con_idx, nnz+1,
@iglesiasg	    asub.vector, aval.vector);
@iglesiasg	I think it must be pretty much like
@iglesiasg	m_rescode = MSK_putarow(m_task, con_idx, nnz+1,  asub.vector, aval.vector);
@iglesiasg	not sure right now why the +1 nnz+1 but with any luck I wrote a comment for that

 wiking	i was looking for replacing MSK_putaveclist
 wiking	not MSK_putavec
@iglesiasg	well then MSK_putarowlist
 wiking	that'll be good ! thnx
 wiking	ok only one more is missing MSK_getsolutionstatus
 wiking	ok this should be it
 wiking	MSK_getprosta
@iglesiasg	welcome
 wiking	oh damn
@sonney2k	wiking, btw we cannot use any of coin-or due to licence conflicts
 wiking	http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/capi/Problem_status_keys.html
 wiking	they are toootaly different
 wiking	why they use what?
@sonney2k	wiking, they used to use CPL
@sonney2k	I forgot what they switched to
@sonney2k	but it was again in conflict to GPL
