 n4nd0	sonne|work: what is m_parameters used for? I have seen in classes like CLinearMachine that all its members are added via m_parameters->add
 sonne|work	n4nd0: for serialization
 sonne|work	e.g. you can just dump a shogun object as e.g. ascii file hdf5 or so to disk
 sonne|work	or pickle it from python
 n4nd0	ok, thank you

 urbino	Hi, what are the popular irc networks and channels for machine learning, statistics, "collective intelligence", ect?
 n4nd0	urbino: have you tried #machinelearning in freenode?
-!- Miggy [~piggy@14.139.82.6] has joined #shogun
 urbino	lurked for a while but it was quiet
 Miggy	hi
 n4nd0	sonne|work: another thing, the implementation of QDA in scikits works for any number of classes
 sonne|work	yeah, LDA works in principle also for multiclass
 n4nd0	sonne|work: but LDA and other classifiers in shogun are implemented for two classes, should I port the multiclass impl from scikits or just restrict to two classes?
 sonne|work	just not implemented
 sonne|work	would be great
 sonne|work	but I would prefer to name this MultiClassLDA then
 Miggy	gsoc 2012 ideas?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I will do the port then as MultiClassQDA :9

 n4nd0	Miggy: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html
 sonne|work	looks like Miggy is really impatient
 sonne|work	n4nd0: btw, which topic are you interested in doing for gsoc?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: the documentation/tutorials and SO are the ones I find most appealing for me

 n4nd0	sonne|work: did you get an answer from Carol about the documentation project?
 sonne|work	not yet :(
 Miggy	gsoc 2012 ideas anyone?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I find really interesting SO but I am not sure if it would be far too optimistic for me to do it
 n4nd0	Miggy: http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/gsoc-ideas.html
 n4nd0	Miggy: check them in that page :)
 Miggy	ok
 Miggy	thanks :)
 n4nd0	Miggy: you are welcome
 sonne|work	I would have some idea how to rescue this project though - it would then be write lots of examples / get the test suite to work again (which is basically just running the examples)
 sonne|work	and then lots of polishing work (exactly what you do now)
 n4nd0	sonne|work: sounds cool
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I think it can be very appropriate for me to get to know shogun much more :)
 sonne|work	like here and there make things more explicit / meaningful error messages instead of asserts ...
 n4nd0	sonne|work: I understand
 sonne|work	some methods are in shogun but not visible (because they need a few classes to interact in a certain way etc)
 n4nd0	ok
 n4nd0	once Carol tells you something new maybe we can define what the exact tasks for that project would be, what do you think?
 Miggy	so was gsoc 2011 successfull for shogun?
 n4nd0	sonne|work: and in any case, what do you think about SO? maybe too difficult?
-!- Miggy [~piggy@14.139.82.6] has quit []
 vikram360	sonne|work : I'm planning on proposing on implementing C5.0 as part of my GSoc Proposal. I think I mailed you about this. I spoke to Ross Quinlan about the documentation for C5.0 and it just so happens that it's not under the GPL. But he did say that I could provide a link to his tutorial instead. So should I propose on adding an additional tutorial to the documentation or would providing rulequests' link suffice?
 sonne|work	vikram360: a link is sufficient - just some general description what it does is needed
 sonne|work	n4nd0: SO might be difficult - maybe you have a chat with nico about this
 n4nd0	sonne|work: does he appear around here sometimes?
 sonne|work	email him...
 vikram360	sonne|work : is implementing C5.0 something that would largely benefit the community?
 n4nd0	:) got it
 n4nd0	sonne|work: anyway, I keep an eye on the documentation one
 n4nd0	or let's say examples to get some sympathy with google :)

 vikram360	sonne2k : In your opinion, will implementing C5.0 benefit the community? Because I want to take it up irrespective of whether I get into GSoc. If there is something that is seemingly more important that it, could you please let me know so that I could start reading up about it?
 vikram360	I meant sonney2k lol
 sonne|work	everything we put on the ideas list is sth we would like to have
 sonne|work	it is important that you already have a look at the code to see how you could do things
 vikram360	sonne|work I'm currently reading a couple of papers about C4.5. I want to make sure that I fully understand the subject before I start any work. I then plan on playing with the rulequest See5 code so I could figure out how it works. (There doesn't seem to be much literature about it :( ). I'll then look at the code and draw up a plan of how I might go about doing it. Any thoughts/advice?

@sonney2k	n4nd0, I finally got an answer - to better remove the doc/tutorial task
@sonney2k	too much of a grey zone - it can be ok but ...
@sonney2k	so better not take any risks
 n4nd0	sonney2k: ok, it's a bit a pity :(
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I think it would be really good to produce that kind of document that was described in gsoc to make shogun more accessible and known to the people
@sonney2k	yes certainly
 n4nd0	sonney2k: I mean, there is lot of stuff implemented here and it could be very handy for people making research in machine learning I think
@sonney2k	problem is just that this is not in scope (or at least grey area) of gsoc - so google doesn't want to fund it
 n4nd0	sonney2k: yes, I understand
 n4nd0	sonney2k: just for curiosity, talking about this topic, how many users do you think shogun has? approximately of course
@sonney2k	no idea
@sonney2k	it has >1000 installs on ubuntu/debian
 n4nd0	I don't know it that is a lot or not for a project like this, but I am almost sure that more than 1000 people could benefit from shogun if they knew about it...
 n4nd0	I am making publicity of it among my friends in the university working in ml :)
@sonney2k	n4nd0, it is certainly used by many colleagues of mine
@sonney2k	and I will keep using it too :)
