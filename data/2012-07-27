 blackburn	pluskid: get_alphas? :)
 blackburn	+ get_support_vectors
 blackburn	ahhh
 blackburn	do you mean shogun's libsvm?
 pluskid	blackburn: yeah
 koen-shogun	both will do the trick
 pluskid	blackburn: I saw there's a struct svm_model * model
 blackburn	still - get_support_vectors().vlen
 pluskid	but it is null
 blackburn	pluskid: what do you mean as trained libsvm object?
 blackburn	which class exactly?
 pluskid	a CLibSVM
 pluskid	after calling train()
 blackburn	ok then just do it the way I described
 pluskid	blackburn: OK, I'll try that
