@sonney2k	blackburn, I am currently working on debian packages of shogun
 blackburn	oh yes it is pretty important :)
@sonney2k	blackburn, do you have time to work on some bugs?
 blackburn	sonney2k: this weekend yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, packages are pain in the ***
 blackburn	only you can do this :)
@sonney2k	it is difficult because I have to build for several python versions
@sonney2k	that's what I get money for - NOT!
@sonney2k	I also don't know where to put csharp stuff
 blackburn	sonney2k: I was laughing one guy wrote in shogun thread that haskell programmer could do the whole shogun in 10 minutes
@sonney2k	blackburn, on this russian linux site?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah
 blackburn	crazy vodka addicts
@sonney2k	you should introduce him to your bear ;-)

@sonney2k	blackburn, anyway drink a bottle of whisky in the name of shogun :D
 blackburn	sonney2k: hah yeah I should
@sonney2k	f-x, and you too :)
@sonney2k	or your preferred drink
 blackburn	sonney2k: will you? ;)
@sonney2k	whatever that mighy be
@sonney2k	blackburn, I already did
 blackburn	hah
@sonney2k	blackburn, one class for every student

 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * rfbb28f9 / (4 files): removal of useless ruby examples - http://git.io/bZZXlQ
 f-x	sonney2k: yes i have my carton of orange juice ready :) cheers!
 f-x	and you too blackburn! :))
* sonney2k can hardly hold the voka bottle stably any longer
@sonney2k	it is all shaky now :)
@sonney2k	f-x, I hope you are satisfied with what is in shogun 1.0.0 now.
@sonney2k	I think I have to write a longer post what happened during gsoc soon.
 f-x	sonney2k: i am.. would like to get responses from users soon, that would really help in improving things
 f-x	great work on the releasing btw
@sonney2k	currently users seem to fail already when installing :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: write it now, it could be frankly now :D
 f-x	i can't seem to understand the problem
@sonney2k	at least when they have weird setups with all shogun's / different python versions mixed
@sonney2k	s/all/old/
@sonney2k	blackburn, I don't have a blog just yet
@sonney2k	need to create one first

 blackburn	sonney2k: why you need a blog?
@sonney2k	blackburn, to blog about shogun
@sonney2k	it has much more impact - because I am a debian developer
@sonney2k	so I can register myself at planet.debian.org
 blackburn	ah I see
@sonney2k	a ex-colleague who is also a DD said that he easily got 2000 hits/day
@sonney2k	when blogging that is
@sonney2k	blackburn, have you seen - the mailinglist suddenly is alive again
 blackburn	sonney2k: yeah my answer about images became useless hah
