@iglesiasg	good morning
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: hey there!
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: The thing I mentioned with GaussianDistribution unit test may be happening in travis too
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds have a look at the build history
@iglesiasg	HeikoS: From build 1626 onwards build for libshogun with unit test is always grey
@iglesiasg	the one that is immediately before finished with green though, https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/builds/9825642

 foulwall	ping sonne|work
 sonne|work	foulwall: hey
 sonne|work	foulwall: we need to make the dimred examples interactive
 foulwall	now working for tree https://www.biomedcentral.com/content/figures/1471-2105-5-126-1-l.jpg
 sonne|work	foulwall: please talk to lisitsyn abou tit
 sonne|work	foulwall: nice
 sonne|work	foulwall: we have hierarchical clustering in shogun and an example so we can then display that
 foulwall	ok sonne|work, I'll show you the tree soon, and add some backend code to it.
 sonne|work	foulwall: I guess I should then try to add some algorithms and data sets and then we will see what is missing
 sonne|work	(for the toy examples)
 sonne|work	foulwall: the only other stuff you could do is add some way of running asp / arts also from the web
 sonne|work	they both need some string to be uploaded
 sonne|work	and some curve to be drawn
 sonne|work	not too difficult
 shogun-buildbot	build #1465 of deb3 - modular_interfaces is complete: Failure [failed compile java_modular]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb3%20-%20modular_interfaces/builds/1465  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: ok now?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: what?
 sonne|work	the get_distance_matrix?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: I didn't try it again, did you change something?
 sonne|work	man
 sonne|work	I even pinged you
 sonne|work	so yes sure try it and my question remains
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: I saw you said yesterday about it was a pthread problem
 sonne|work	do you have a good name for a common base class of CKernel & CDistance
@iglesiasg	similarity measure
 sonne|work	these things are somewhat similar so I would try to refactor them
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: hmmh distance is rather dissimilarity and kernel similarity
@iglesiasg	I guess that is a matter of taste :)
@iglesiasg	I mean why increasing magnitude must mean what you are trying to describe
@iglesiasg	decreasing magnitude is equally describing
@iglesiasg	and distance=0 means they are as similar as they can get
@iglesiasg	anyway, I am not picky with names (to some extent)
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: why did you add init_shogun_with defaults and exit_shogun in the unit test btw?
@iglesiasg	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/commit/d474227dac6e804fd8376877237f5b6bf49af67a
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: and yep, it is ok now :)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I wanted to do display_matrix()
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: it doesn't work otherwise?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work:
 sonne|work	ermm no idea
 foulwall	gotcha sonne|work
@iglesiasg	let me try
 sonne|work	foulwall: but for the asp/arts applications you have to be *very* aware about security issues like upload a too big file (-> crash) etc
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: ok so CSimilarity then?
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: it is fine for me
@iglesiasg	sonney2k: and display matrix works fine with init_shogun yeah
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: with or without?
@iglesiasg	I keep on speaking to your home alter ego
@iglesiasg	sonne|work:  without, sorry
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: so the holidays have ended now?
 sonne|work	yea :(
@iglesiasg	I am sorry :(
 sonne|work	in particular since it is supposed to be 29 C today in Berlin
 sonne|work	and 33 C Tue/Wed
@iglesiasg	awesome
@iglesiasg	I think it is a really cool city, I was even surprised with it!
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: which reminds we that we still don't have our video recordings online
 sonne|work	wiking: any progress?
@iglesiasg	yeah! I have to see HeikoS video again and take notes :D
* sonne|work too
@wiking	sonne|work: with?
 sonne|work	the video cutting and our youtube channel :)
@wiking	yeah i've cutted the morning session
@wiking	the shogun channel should be registered on a common shogun email

 lisitsyn	haha sonne|work now you too
 lisitsyn	*work*
 lisitsyn	*evil haha*
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: baeh!
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: is it happening right now?
 sonne|work	wiking: what email do we want for that?
 sonne|work	wiking: cool!
 sonne|work	sth like shogun@shogun-toolbox.org ?
 sonne|work	or what?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	something like that
* wiking is debugging octave on ubuntu 12.04
 sonne|work	wiking: and us 5 being the ones who receive emails on that address?
@wiking	yeah
-!- hushell [~hushell@c-24-21-169-136.hsd1.or.comcast.net] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	ok
 sonne|work	wiking: I will create that then tonight
@wiking	cool
@wiking	then i'll create the shogun youtube channel
 hushell	iglesiasg: Hi, I sent a PR, could you help me check the MAPInference.h? Do I make things right for the opaque pointer?
 lisitsyn	iglesiasg: you are the opaque pointer guy now ;)
 hushell	haha
@wiking	lisitsyn: do u have still octave
@wiking	on your machine..?
 lisitsyn	wiking: I can run it on a virtual machine with debian
 lisitsyn	just let me know what to test
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: if we are into gsoc next year opaque pointering whole shogun would be some task
@wiking	lisitsyn: ah no i was hoping u have the same machine that u had the last day where octave was detected fine
 sonne|work	wiking: btw can you somehow extract your cmake history and merge it into develop?
@iglesiasg	hushell: hey! I will read it later this evening, ok?
@wiking	sonne|work: i'll rebase it first with develop
 sonne|work	wiking: I would very much prefer that you do it there and I could already start switching buildbots
@wiking	and then i'll merge or something
 sonne|work	wiking: just no mess please (I thought you are just working on a single file...)
 hushell	iglesiasg: sure. I am going to sleep right now. Take your time :)
@wiking	sonne|work: no it's serveral files
@wiking	but it still needs work
@wiking	so i'll do some more tests
@wiking	before anything
 sonne|work	wiking: but for example libshogun will certainly work
@wiking	yeah for sure
 sonne|work	wiking: and cygwin is failing with configure with 30% chance
 sonne|work	so I would prefer to switch ASAP there
 lisitsyn	wiking: I can test this thing later tonight then if it is still relevant by that time
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: please talk to foulwall about the dimred demos!
@wiking	sonne|work: can we install VS on that cygwin bot?
 sonne|work	wiking: I guess so
@wiking	sonne|work: we could try to build shogun with VS :P
 sonne|work	wiking: btw how difficult is it with travis to add another python modular build with python3.x?
 sonne|work	wiking: it will kaboom for sure
 sonne|work	wiking: but yes let me write an email and ask
@wiking	sonne|work: i guess 12.04 has no python3 or?
@wiking	it does
@wiking	in that case it's not complicated at all
 sonne|work	wiking: no idea - lisitsyn do you remember?
 lisitsyn	wiking: you can install python3 indeed
 lisitsyn	default is not 3 though
 sonne|work	wiking: well then :D
 sonne|work	wiking: would be nice to have - gsomix did invest so much time in this - lets not have code rot kill that

 van51	hello
 sonne|work	hey van51!
 sonne|work	how is it going
 sonne|work	any exciting benchmark news?
 foulwall	ping lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	foulwall: pong
 foulwall	hey:)
 lisitsyn	hey
 lisitsyn	I guess you want to talk about something interactive with DR
 foulwall	yeah, how about add some more data set?
 foulwall	user upload is not practical for security reasons.
 foulwall	lisitsyn: any ideas?
 lisitsyn	foulwall: yes you can change algorithm parameters
 lisitsyn	for example
 lisitsyn	for LLE and LTSA
 lisitsyn	you can change k
 lisitsyn	foulwall: reasonable values range of k is [6, number of vectors]
 lisitsyn	that's the number of neighbors

 foulwall	lisitsyn: Ok, :)I'll do that.
 thoralf	Hey.
 lisitsyn	foulwall: how do you compute embeddings now?
 van51	sonney2k: hey!
 lisitsyn	you just load it from json data I had, right?
 van51	sonney2k: well on the webspam, on about ~10k examples, the converter is much faster
 foulwall	lisitsyn: yes,
 van51	sonney2k: it takes like the 1/3 ~ 1/2 of the time
 van51	sonne|work: ^
 van51	sonne|work: but I had trouble running it on more examples, as it was running out of memory
 sonne|work	van51: including conversion time or excluding?
 van51	sonney2k: including
 sonne|work	but wrt out of memory I would have guessed so
 sonne|work	van51: and excluding?
-!- thoralfk [~thoralf@enki.zib.de] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	van51: I guess conversion time is just a few secs though?
 van51	sonne|work: well, the training time of the SparseFeatures returned is instantaneous
-!- thoralf [~thoralf@enki.zib.de] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
 van51	sonne|work: and the conversion doesn't take too much
 sonne|work	van51: ok then this would make a nice graph/blog post
 sonne|work	van51: btw did you manage to get the string kernel based variant running?
 van51	sonne|work: I had attempted it when you made that change, but it was crashing again
 van51	sonne|work: and I didn't have the chance to further test it, had some busy days :S
 van51	sonne|work: I can try it again now
 van51	sonne|work: what I worked on a bit is the language detection
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@adsl-84-227-37-53.adslplus.ch] has joined #shogun
 sonne|work	van51: if it is still crashing (please run it with valgrind on some really small data) then I guess I will have to debug it - best would be you could craft some minimal unit test with a failing example then
 sonne|work	so I can concentrate on a fix
 sonne|work	van51: (excited) how is it going with the language detection?
@iglesiasg	did kernel_anova_modular.py start failing recently?
 sonne|work	that is also a nice application and demo that can easily be integrated with foulwalls asp/arts based applications on the web :)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: errm
@iglesiasg	https://travis-ci.org/shogun-toolbox/shogun/jobs/9849933
 sonne|work	I touched it
 sonne|work	but I was 'just' using gsomix' csv reader
 sonne|work	thought that it was actaully working
 van51	sonne|work: very well actully. with just a small subset it achieves like 99% accuracy
 sonne|work	van51: yeah I guessed so :)
 sonne|work	van51: which n-gram length?
 van51	sonne|work: 8
 sonne|work	hmmhh pretty long!
 sonne|work	van51: btw I was thinking that maybe having ngrams of size 1...8 might actually also be useful ( I mean mixtures)
 sonne|work	van51: maybe you try with CombinedDotFeatures to have 2 of your HashedDocFeatures
 sonne|work	one with say n=4 and one wiht n=8
 sonne|work	but if it is that good already
 sonne|work	it is probably sufficient
 van51	sonne|work: it is good on those "large documents"
 sonne|work	ahh ok
 van51	sonne|work: it had some trouble in small sentences
 sonne|work	we should try short sentences
 van51	sonne|work: when I was testing it
 van51	sonne|work: maybe with the reduced size it will be better there as well
 sonne|work	so basically you extract from the wikipedia documents shorter substrings (maybe even full sentences)
 van51	sonne|work: I was thinking of testing that with the quadratic hasheddoc features once they are merged
 sonne|work	or something like x words
 sonne|work	and then train / test on that
 van51	sonne|work: hmm ok can do :D
-!- hoijui [~hoijui@adsl-84-227-37-53.adslplus.ch] has quit [Quit: Leaving]
 van51	sonne|work: I would like to port the classes to the modular interfaces first
 sonne|work	van51: ohh that port takes 5 minutes
 van51	sonne|work: I just add the appropriate includes and rename it?
 sonne|work	van51: lets just do it now
 sonne|work	yes exactly
 sonne|work	search for CombinedDotFeatures in interfaces/modular/Feature*
 sonne|work	then copy and change your code
 sonne|work	err change to your class names
 sonne|work	recompile and try
 sonne|work	and PR :)
 sonne|work	van51: just do that now and later please explain what https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1342 is
 gsomix	good morning? =___='
 sonne|work	gsomix: hey there!
 gsomix	sonne|work, sth wrong with csv reader?
 sonne|work	gsomix: not clear yet
 sonne|work	gsomix: maybe I am just using it wrong
 gsomix	sonne|work, I'm compiling python_modular now, then I can check.
 sonne|work	gsomix: I guess it might be my C order change
 sonne|work	not sure though
 van51	sonne|work: the idea behind that PR is to combine tokens in a specific window of size n+s, where n is the number of the tokens to combine and s is how many tokens you 're allowed to skip
 sonne|work	I would say it makes much more sense to have ascii data in a way
 sonne|work	that each example is in one line
 sonne|work	so whatever other tools might do we shoudl stick to that
 van51	sonne|work: I have an inline note there that explain this notion of skipping
 sonne|work	van51: yeah I was about to ask
 van51	sonne|work: also all combination of smaller size are addeed
 van51	combinations*, added*
 sonne|work	van51: btw I was thinking that maybe it is better to have a *fixed* seed for the hashing - did olivier/benoit say sth about it?
 van51	sonne|work: no that hasn't been discussed
 van51	sonne|work: but it is fixed atm
 sonne|work	van51: ahh ok then
@wiking	sonne|work: ok i was away but yeah i'll add python3 modular test on travis
 sonne|work	van51: what you are doing is called (in its extreme) the subsequence kernel
 sonne|work	van51: very useful
 sonne|work	van51: the skipping and combination I mean
 sonne|work	van51: if you allow n=3 it would take anything from n=1 up to 3 right?

 sonne|work	gsomix: it just makes more sense for ascii
 sonne|work	gsomix: so if I would flip the data in the example file it will work
@wiking	sonne|work: imo we should enable ccache for compiler and swig on buildbots

@wiking	ok i'll add an ENABLE_CCACHE to the cmake
@wiking	which will be by default disabled
@wiking	i still have some build problems on travis with ruby_modular
@wiking	but first i'll try now to rebase the branch to develop
 sonne|work	wiking: no enable by default
@wiking	ok the only problem with rebase actually is with
 gsomix	sonney2k, hm, ok. but I don't think that its good idea. SGMatrix stores data in fortran-order, and example file too.
 gsomix	sonne|work, aww :) ^
@wiking	.travis.yml file
 sonne|work	gsomix: then we should change that
@wiking	since there has been some changes in the meanwhile
@wiking	:P
@wiking	sonne|work: ok so if there's ccache(-swig) then it's going to be enabled...
 sonne|work	cool
@wiking	sonne|work: can i have access to a deb buildbot where there's enough ram where i could test python_modular interface?
 sonne|work	we don't have any :/
@wiking	:(
@wiking	anybody can give me shell access to his machine which is a deb/ubuntu machine
@wiking	plz
 gsomix	sonne|work, should we change data order in SGMatrix? O_o too many work, I think.
 van51	wiking: sure
@wiking	sonne|work: i'll add to cmake gmock and json in a way that if one wants it and the script cannot find a valid working one locally it'll try to download it itself
@wiking	van51: u need a public key or something?
 sonne|work	gsomix: no not change it in SGMatrix
 sonne|work	wiking: woah maven!
 sonne|work	wiking: can you do that with eigen3 too?
@wiking	sonne|work: yep
@wiking	sonne|work: any package i can do
 sonne|work	but it should be possible to disable that right?
@wiking	sonne|work: yeap i can do it in way
@wiking	i mean in any way we wish
 sonne|work	wiking: sounds good
 van51	wiking: I just set up an account for you
@wiking	but i'll currently only set it up for json and gmock
@wiking	sonne|work: since eigen has cmake as well... we can use that right away ;)
@wiking	sonne|work: where does the buildbot master run?
@wiking	sonne|work: and we should ask gunnar about that mac machine ;)
@wiking	that he said it could be used for buildbot
 sonne|work	wiking: ohh good idea let me jsut do that
@wiking	sonne|work: thnx
 sonne|work	errm food
@wiking	van51: i'll try to do a build on your machine i hope you dont mind ;)
 gsomix	sonne|work, so, do you want just change example file?

 pickle27	hmmmm
 pickle27	can you copy the lib file to your working python dir? I don't even know if that would work
@HeikoS	pickle27: yeah I need something like that :)

@HeikoS	but I want to avoid doing hacks ;)
@HeikoS	thoralf: you mean prefix?
 thoralf	HeikoS: No.
@HeikoS	thoralf: problem is that I cannot do make install
@HeikoS	the make installation doesnt allow it
 thoralf	--pydir=DIR

 thoralf	bug
@HeikoS	thoralf: Sorry user bla is not allowed to execute /usr/bin/make install as root
 thoralf	HeikoS: Have a look into .config, parameter PYDIR
@HeikoS	thoralf: ah, I just did it wothout root ;)
@HeikoS	pydir is the target of the python installation?
 thoralf	HeikoS: Yes.
@HeikoS	thoralf: cool, where do I have to let that point?
 thoralf	HeikoS: I don't understand.  What do you mean?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, errm it works
@HeikoS	thoralf: so I now installed it locally to somedir/lib/python2.7
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah I just never did this and asking how :)
@sonney2k	HeikoS, just do ./configure --prefix=~/my/local/path
@HeikoS	how to call python so that it recognises the installation
@HeikoS	sonney2k: did that
@HeikoS	and the?
@sonney2k	then make install
@HeikoS	did
@HeikoS	and then?
@HeikoS	add pythonpath?
@sonney2k	PYTHONPATH=$HOME/my/local/path/deep/down/there LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/my/local/path/lib python
@sonney2k	import modshogun
@sonney2k	from python then
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah that easy, cool thanks!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, the PYTHONPATH has to point to the dir where you find modshogun
@sonney2k	HeikoS, lisitsyn: btw do you have a minute? I want to change behavior of ascii readers quite a bit.
@sonney2k	to make each line an example
@sonney2k	e.g.
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yeah on one ear
@sonney2k	for strings
@sonney2k	'ablfjdslkfjaslkfasdjf\n'
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I never used any of this stuff so far
@HeikoS	always using python for that
@sonney2k	would be in one line -> one string later in shogun
@HeikoS	sonney2k: sounds good
 thoralf	sonney2k: --prefix does not work for octave, btw.
@sonney2k	for sparse features same thing: one line -> one sparse feature vector
 thoralf	sonney2k: The path is still global.
@sonney2k	thoralf, I know - octave doesn't support this
@sonney2k	thoralf, at least 2.x / 3.0 when I tried to add support for that
@sonney2k	thoralf, if it works now tell my how!
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well that already works
@sonney2k	HeikoS, problem is now for dense matrices
@sonney2k	this will lead to a transposed view in SGMatrix
@sonney2k	because one line -> one column vector!
@sonney2k	becauase one column vector == one example in shogun
@sonney2k	and this might confuse people
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah I see
@HeikoS	sonney2k: btw any reason for the col format matrices?
@sonney2k	and FWIW octave and matlab write matrices not as I would do it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, yes sure
@HeikoS	sonney2k: it would be so cool if we had numpy style views on matrices
@sonney2k	HeikoS, simply if you want just 100 examples
@HeikoS	with slice operations etc
@sonney2k	you can stop reading after 100 lines
@sonney2k	and you can do streaming from the same code
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok makes sense
* thoralf is already using steramingasciifile for this and creates sparse matrices ;)
@sonney2k	and it is more consistent considering sparse/string stuff where one line == one example
@sonney2k	soon ascii file will die :D
 thoralf	sonney2k: Oh.
@sonney2k	gsomix' CSVFile is replacing it
@sonney2k	it already does everything asciifile does but faster and with configurable seperators
@sonney2k	HeikoS, to do this I will need to transpose our dense real toy data with transposed versions
 thoralf	sonney2k: As long as it's supported by streaming sparse features, it's not a big deal.
 thoralf	sonney2k: Or something similar, if this dies, too. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes it will :D
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah I see
@HeikoS	sonney2k: bit I agree on it
 thoralf	sonney2k: It will die or it will support ssf? ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, CSV will do it
@sonney2k	HeikoS, anyway this is only relevant for csv data - in fact with csv users usually have 1 example == 1 line
@sonney2k	so IMHO it would be confusing not to do it
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: here
@sonney2k	we could have an option to read the transpose (.tsv)
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, would you mind having one line == one example notion also for ascii dense matrices
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no don't mind at all
 lisitsyn	transpose option is the best though I guess?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, gsomix' reader already supports fortran and c order
 gsomix	hey guys
@sonney2k	so just specifying fortran order would make the transpose loaded
 gsomix	I have some vodka - time to work
@sonney2k	gsomix, what are you working on now btw?
@sonney2k	I mean I guess I will know soon from your email :D
 gsomix	sonney2k, still libsvm file/quoting/refactoring for CircularBuffer. I'll send PR today.
 gsomix	I hope vodka helps me

 thoralf	Aww.  This swig thing only uses one core to compile... taking ages. :(
 thoralf	sonney2k: I guess octave should work from local directory, I'm about to check it, but need to wait for swig.
@sonney2k	thoralf, yeah if you have an idea how to split a .cpp file into 10 or so it would be nice to compile that all in parallel
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes but where do I copy the sg.so / modshogun.so then?
 thoralf	sonney2k: It's one big cpp file?  Jesus. ;)
@sonney2k	thoralf, yes
@sonney2k	gtg
@sonney2k	cu
 thoralf	sonney2k: octave_modular/_static already work when calling "make tests-local".  So it's already set up properly.

 lisitsyn	lets see if I reproduce it
 van51	sonney2k: I've updated the PR for the hashed doc features. I think it's OK now
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: idk checking

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: Install libshogun examples under share/shogun/examples/libshogun
 shogun-notifier-	shogun: add initial component based packaging for DEB and RPM
@wiking	yey motherfuckers
@HeikoS	wiking: whoooo
@wiking	ok so now i'm still missing ccache-swig support
@wiking	and the fucking travis builds for octave, ruby and python3
@wiking	i cannot find the fucking travis vm image anywhere for download
@wiking	ah and btw: no _static interface is supported at all :D
@HeikoS	wiking: ha!
@HeikoS	that might be good :)
-!- van51 [~van51@ppp-94-66-42-68.home.otenet.gr] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
@HeikoS	wiking: I have made some progress with the notebooks btw
@HeikoS	think I will get it working soon
@wiking	that's great
@wiking	i'll have to add it to the cmake :P
@HeikoS	wiking: nice :)
@HeikoS	wiking: btw do you have any ideas for the docsprint? should we do that?
@HeikoS	wiking: still one day left
@HeikoS	until deadline
@wiking	HeikoS: heheheh :D
@wiking	is it already? :)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah
@wiking	fuck
@HeikoS	I am terribly busy unitl tomorrow unfortunately but maybe we should submit something
@HeikoS	but just copying last year's application wont do it since we were rejected
@HeikoS	we need a "vision" for a book
@HeikoS	and maybe some power users, like thoralf
@HeikoS	and I think just a list of ML algorithms also wont do it
@HeikoS	should be less scientific, more cummunity based
@HeikoS	but dont know
@HeikoS	whether its worth the hassle, last year, kind of big organisations were picked, like KDE
@wiking	ehehe
@HeikoS	wiking: so what do you think?
@wiking	mmm worth a try imho
@wiking	if nothing else the copy paste
@wiking	i mean why not :)
@wiking	worst case we get another reject
@wiking	nothing bad can come out of that
@HeikoS	wiking: ah
@HeikoS	wow
@HeikoS	deadline just got extended :)
@HeikoS	2 mins ago
@wiking	heheh
@HeikoS	yeah! :)
@HeikoS	then I can do it end of the week
@HeikoS	phew
@wiking	which means there's not enough
@wiking	applications
@HeikoS	The response from individuals has been tremendous, but we'd like to encourage more projects to apply as well.
@wiking	which is good for us
@HeikoS	lets doooo it then
@wiking	yeah lets do it
@HeikoS	wiking: cool ill take care after tues

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: make clean helps
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no idea what it was
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking is there any way to detect this make clean weirdness
@HeikoS	recompiling libshogun often gives crashes in unit tests
@HeikoS	make clean;make solves it
@HeikoS	would be nice tobe detected automatically
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I think cmake is better in this
@HeikoS	ok
 lisitsyn	but not sure
 lisitsyn	well with cmake we rely on cmake
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, wiking another question:
@HeikoS	here at uni I have the problem that there are many computers with different architectures
@HeikoS	so when I run stuff on the cluster, I cannot use my locally compiled shogun installation
@HeikoS	but would have to create one for every system and match them
@HeikoS	any ideas how to solve this best?
@HeikoS	also, I cannot guarantee the installed packages on the computers
@HeikoS	will cmake help me with this? :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: haha
 lisitsyn	will cmake cure cancer
@wiking	some modtherfucker did this
@HeikoS	I would like to just add a one-liner to my scripts that installs shogun locally for the given architecture
@wiking	javac] /home/travis/build/shogun-toolbox/shogun/src/interfaces/java_modular/org/shogun/CProbabilityDistribution.java:111: error: method log_pdf(Doublatrix) is already defined in class CProbabilityDistribution

 lisitsyn	wiking: I was looking at it and saw no error here
@wiking	[javac] 2 errors
 lisitsyn	Doublatrix?
@wiking	lisitsyn: that's cmake error
 lisitsyn	what?
@HeikoS	wiking: that probably was me, what is that?
 lisitsyn	Doublatrix?
@wiking	sometimes it eats some chars
@wiking	the console jquery is sometimes ...
@wiking	so it's shit
 lisitsyn	ahh
@wiking	but dont worry it's not that
 lisitsyn	so that's not
 lisitsyn	doubltrix
 lisitsyn	oh
@wiking	nop
 lisitsyn	phew
 lisitsyn	:D
@HeikoS	virtual SGVector<float64_t> log_pdf(SGMatrix<float64_t> samples) const;
@HeikoS	virtual float64_t log_pdf(SGVector<float64_t> single_sample) const;
@HeikoS	is this the problem?
 lisitsyn	ahhhhh
@wiking	yes
 lisitsyn	yes of course
@HeikoS	both of those methods are defined
@wiking	it's a major problems
 lisitsyn	but return value
@HeikoS	what?
@wiking	u cannot have that
@HeikoS	why?
@wiking	because c++
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: SGVector = SGMatrix
 lisitsyn	in java
 lisitsyn	no that's not because C++
@wiking	lisitsyn: noup
 lisitsyn	C++ is ok here
@HeikoS	oh thats stupid
@wiking	why?
@wiking	ah yeah
@wiking	ok
@wiking	i see
@HeikoS	I would love them to have a common base
 lisitsyn	wiking: everything is ok C++ wise
@HeikoS	I think its a restriction
@wiking	lisitsyn: yeah misinterpreted the func arg in my had
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: jblas doesn't have such stuff
@wiking	*head
@HeikoS	but now I cannot even rely on this
@HeikoS	mmh
@HeikoS	so rename?
 lisitsyn	jblas has just matrix
 lisitsyn	yes rename will help here
@wiking	HeikoS: i wonder if u can rename it only at modular level :P
@wiking	but that would be misleading
@wiking	soooo
@wiking	go for a full rename
@HeikoS	ok then
@wiking	life's a bitch my friend
@wiking	;P
@wiking	ain't no likey the stuff :D
@HeikoS	wiking: did you see my question above? any ideas?
@wiking	HeikoS: mmmm welll
@wiking	HeikoS: u'll have to do it one by one the build
@wiking	HeikoS: or be a hero and create the ExternalProject_Add
@wiking	for all the dependencies in shogun
@wiking	cmake...
@wiking	that'll fetch all the fucking dependency and build it with shogun
@wiking	all your problems will be gone
@wiking	;)
@wiking	but maybe your compile time will be a bit big
@HeikoS	wiking: this would compile all dependencies right?
@wiking	HeikoS: y
@HeikoS	wiking: mmmh, so on some machines I cannot even install eigen
@HeikoS	what about half half
@wiking	HeikoS: u dont care about that part
@HeikoS	python and swig is almost everywhere
@wiking	HeikoS: you'll build all the deps internally that are not found on the system
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah
@HeikoS	that sounds good
@wiking	HeikoS: this can be done with cmake
@HeikoS	and then install locally and add to path bla
@HeikoS	wiking: nice
@wiking	HeikoS: but one needs to create this
@HeikoS	wonderful, will make my life so much easier
@wiking	HeikoS: no you dont need to add to path anything ...
@wiking	cmake will take care of it
@wiking	but
@wiking	one has to write these
@wiking	for all the fucking libraries we are depending on
@wiking	which is quite seom
@wiking	*some
@HeikoS	wiking: how and where? I can do that
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/CMake/tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt
@wiking	HeikoS: there's an example for ya
@wiking	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/feature/CMake/tests/unit/CMakeLists.txt#L10
@wiking	to be precise
@wiking	it downloads and compiles gtest/gmock
@HeikoS	should I modify this file?
@wiking	no
 lisitsyn	no that's tests cmake lists
@wiking	that's only an exmaple
@wiking	what u should do is
@wiking	first think about a general way how to do this
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: have you worked with maven?
@wiking	but i would say
@wiking	in the cmake dir
@wiking	we should add a new dir called
@wiking	cmake/external
@wiking	and start adding there the cmake scripts for the various libraries we depend on
 lisitsyn	we can distribite eigen3 along with our sources actually
@wiking	and then we can include those wherever we need them
 lisitsyn	just headers
 lisitsyn	:D
@wiking	lisitsyn: yes
 lisitsyn	but IIRC sonney2k is not a big fan of it
@wiking	but you can just compile it
@wiking	and not distribute
@wiking	and that's good enough imho
 lisitsyn	compile what?
@sonney2k	wiking, pong
@wiking	lisitsyn: just simply have eigen3 as a third_party and then compile the libshogun with that eigen3
 lisitsyn	oh I summoned sonney2k
@wiking	sonney2k: mmm i have no idea what i wanted :)
@wiking	sonney2k: oh yeah i have deb packages for libshogun
@wiking	;)
@wiking	sonney2k: you should start thinking about where to upload them

@wiking	sonney2k: and as well what the fuck is the naming convention for nightly built deb packages?
@wiking	i mean for version
@wiking	the git string?
@sonney2k	wiking, we could create an apt archive thing on shogun-toolbox.org
@wiking	yes
@sonney2k	wiking, there is no clear naming convention
@sonney2k	wiking, some people use 1.2.0+git<hash>
@wiking	ok
@wiking	then it'll be something like that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: i used maven like 4 years ago for a bit at uni, but forgot everything
@sonney2k	some use 1.2.0+20130805git<hash>-1
@sonney2k	wiking, btw I am currently setting up our team address - should it be shogun-team@ ... ?
@sonney2k	some mailman mailinglist
@wiking	mmm yeah something like that
@wiking	sonney2k: i mean even an alias is good
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: that's sth like maven then ;)
@sonney2k	wiking, list is easiest we have the infrastructure already and so should be using it
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, why is the words embedding so slow?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no idea
@wiking	fucking us is awake... travis is much slower at these times

@HeikoS	we should have dev meetings twice a year :)
@sonney2k	wiking, feel free to start uploading the videos!
@wiking	sonney2k: thnx
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I am waiting you here in january
@wiking	sonney2k: i'll need uplink for that
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we should maybe have some monthly(?) irc / google hangout based discussions
@HeikoS	no but seriously, would be very cool I think
@HeikoS	sonney2k: yep I also agree
@sonney2k	I mean we have lots to discuss but we never take the time
@HeikoS	yep I agree
@HeikoS	sonney2k:  one solution would be to discuss in the issues
@sonney2k	so better have some evening every no and then and do some decision in a *focussed* way
@HeikoS	That was my idea with this general ideas to discuss
@iglesiasg	I think it is a good idea to do these meetings
@sonney2k	wiking, uplink? not on your server then I guess?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: and then paste the logs somewhere
@HeikoS	or even somebody has to summarise
@HeikoS	so that we and others know whats going on
@HeikoS	thats actually a nice thing
@sonney2k	HeikoS, or IRC... etherpad etc
@HeikoS	or even google hangouts :)
@HeikoS	if we are <5
 lisitsyn	they should called it google hangover

@wiking	how great to have shogun in qemu image :)
@sonney2k	wiking, haha
@wiking	i wonder what could be the fix for this
@sonney2k	wiking, I usually compile just with -O3 but no -march etc flags
@sonney2k	then it will work
@sonney2k	a lot slower for sure but it will work
@wiking	yeye but still...
@wiking	i want to be able to build this shit in qemu
@wiking	with cmake
@wiking	so fuck it
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, about java_modular
@iglesiasg	virtual SGVector<float64_t> log_pdf(SGMatrix<float64_t> samples) const;
@iglesiasg	this one together with this other one
@iglesiasg	virtual float64_t log_pdf(SGVector<float64_t> single_sample) const;
@iglesiasg	give a compile error
@iglesiasg	I checked the .java, and it is because both SGVector and SGMatrix are traduced to DoubleMatrix in java
@iglesiasg	but I have seen some RealVector in other .java created by SWIG
@iglesiasg	one of them was a SGVector<float64_t>&
