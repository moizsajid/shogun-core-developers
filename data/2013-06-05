 lambday	sonney2k: good morning :)
@sonney2k	lambday, hey!
@sonney2k	lambday, if you have time please fix the build :) I mean the rng init might help...
 lambday	sonney2k: there is another problem.. in the Complex unittest (which just checks for abs and do not have any permutation before that) also fails for 1e-15..
 lambday	what could be the reason for that one? :(
-!- gsomix [~gsomix@83.234.169.64] has joined #shogun
@sonney2k	lambday, that should not happen
 lambday	sonney2k: I checked buildbot logs and it shows failure for that test too :(

@sonney2k	lambday, who is computing abs(a)
@sonney2k	for a being a complex type?
 gsomix	good morning
@sonney2k	is this in std:: ?
 lambday	oh.. its the std::abs... I should have used CMath::abs() for complex, but that also currently calls std::abs() only
@sonney2k	lambday, then you found in a bug in std::
@sonney2k	the result is just wrong on bsd
@sonney2k	lambday, using an arbitrary precision calculator the result should be
@sonney2k	7.81024967590665439413
@sonney2k	; (5**2+6**2)^0.5 - 7.81024967590665397665
@sonney2k	0.00000000000000041748
@sonney2k	; (5**2+6**2)^0.5 - 7.8102496759066558
@sonney2k	-0.00000000000000140587
@sonney2k	is what we see otherwise
@sonney2k	so <1e-15 is what you have with the number you gave as reference
@sonney2k	but the other is really off
@sonney2k	gsomix, morning! today is test day right?
 lambday	sonney2k: okay.. I should change the reference too then..
 lambday	but what to do with this bsd? I am not sure :(
@sonney2k	there is no fix
@sonney2k	we can only go to 1e-14
@sonney2k	precision
 lambday	:(
 lambday	okay
 gsomix	sonney2k, yep.
@sonney2k	and then ask wiking to install newer std stuff
@sonney2k	gtg, cu
 lambday	sonney2k: okies
 lambday	ciao :)
 lambday	I'll submit the PR soon

 lambday	sonney2k: hi.. I changed our CMath::abs(complex64_t a) to not to make use of std::abs() but rather calculate it
 lambday	sonney2k: I think this should work in bsd..
 lambday	the SGVector test error also arises from abs()...
 lambday	but I can't check whether it works or not in bsd.. should I keep the tests as 1e-15 and if this time it doesn't work then make it 1e-14?
 lambday	sonne|work:
 sonne|work	lambday: yes makes sense
 lambday	sonne|work: okay.. then sending a PR with just that
@iglesiasg	lambday, I can merge that now
@iglesiasg	why did you change the constant in the comparisons?
 lambday	iglesiasg: okay :) thanks
@iglesiasg	that is the new value you get when you run it with CMath::abs?
 lambday	iglesiasg: no.. this is what I get using bc
@iglesiasg	bc?
 lambday	similar to what sonne|work: wrote this morning
 lambday	arbitrary precision calculator or something
@iglesiasg	aham ok
@iglesiasg	lambday, so did you use another program to get that value?
 lambday	iglesiasg: yes
 lambday	for these two values
@iglesiasg	lambday, ok, matlab or so?
 lambday	no.. its called bc
@iglesiasg	and it runs well on your machine
@iglesiasg	aaah ok, got it now :)
 lambday	http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html
@iglesiasg	I thought bc was a generic name for arbitrary precision calculators
@iglesiasg	though I didn't get where the shortform could come from
 lambday	iglesiasg: my mistake :( I should have been more clear with it.. actually I didn't know about this until this morning
@iglesiasg	lambday, no problem :)
@iglesiasg	let's just check that the test is fine on travis build
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: matlab just uses double too
@iglesiasg	and later hope it goes well on bsd
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, aham
 lambday	yes.. the value that c++ program gives lie within the range 1e-15 of the value that bc gives
 sonne|work	so it suffers the same issues
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, this arbitrary precision calculator use a list of digits?
@iglesiasg	or similar idea?
 sonne|work	you tell it how many digits you want

* lambday keeping his fingers crossed
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, I actually think there is something in matlab to set more precision than double
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: no there is not
@iglesiasg	ok :)
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: type 1-1.01
 sonne|work	in matlab
 sonne|work	and set format to the best possible
 sonne|work	then you will see
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, http://www.mathworks.se/help/symbolic/vpa.html
 sonne|work	IIRC
 sonne|work	format long
 sonne|work	1-1.01
@iglesiasg	I can be wrong

@HeikoS	hi
 lambday	checking your comments
@HeikoS	commenting ... :)
@HeikoS	lambday: done
 lambday	HeikoS: okay.. I'm checking :)
 lambday	HeikoS: alright..
 lambday	I'm making the changes then
@iglesiasg	lisitsyn, do you know why the buildbot builds first the merge commit and then the other?
@iglesiasg	it looks weird to me, since the other one is done first
 sonne|work	thoralf: well not for the PR
 sonne|work	but for the general repository yeah kaboom time :D
 thoralf	sonne|work: So you don't know other ways than 1. a new PR or 2. push --force?
 thoralf	sonne|work: "but for the general repository yeah kaboom time" <-- parse error ;)
 sonne|work	thoralf: push --force is what we usually do
 sonne|work	(for PRs!)
@lisitsyn	iglesiasg: no don't know why that
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: I think it is building the master branch for some reason
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, mmm but it seems to build the changes were are pushing these days, that go to develop branch
 sonne|work	iglesiasg: well you can see what it built http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun
@iglesiasg	sonne|work, yep, that is develop
 sonne|work	no idea then
 wiking	lisitsyn: not that i know of
 wiking	(libocas)
@iglesiasg	wiking, any idea why shogun buildbot builds the commit in that order?
@iglesiasg	say there is a PR with a commit then someones merge it
@iglesiasg	it builts first the merge, then the original commit
 lambday	HeikoS: could please have a look at : https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1140/files#L19R508
 wiking	iglesiasg: lol... sorry no idea
@iglesiasg	then we leave it as x-file :D
@HeikoS	lambday: good that you found that one!
 lambday	HeikoS: more unit-tests? :(
 lambday	okay adding
@HeikoS	lambday: not your fault, but this nicely illustrates why one should always add at least one per method that makes sure no nonsense is produced
@HeikoS	if you could add one for this, this would be very helpful
 lambday	HeikoS: yes..
 lambday	even I missed a few for complex and SGVector.. I'll make sure that each method is called at least once.. (may not need a separate test case for each method then)
 lambday	or a separate one for each one is better?
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: @sonney2k, thoralf
@HeikoS	seperate is better
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	lambday: but depends on how much work you want to invest
@HeikoS	if its separated, its way easier to track errors
@HeikoS	tests should be as simple as possible
@HeikoS	have  alook at the SGObject tests I recently added
 lambday	okay
@HeikoS	20 of them or so, since it allows to quickly see whats wrong
 lambday	and for the parameters, I should add test cases too in the TParameter tests, right?
 lambday	for complex64_t I mean
@HeikoS	lambday: question is what to test there
@HeikoS	but actually, yes that would be helpful
 lambday	compare_ptype
@HeikoS	since then we have a fine grid of whats going on
@HeikoS	rather than "serialization doesnt work"
 lambday	okay.. I'll check it
 lambday	will add that too in the PR then? including the edits for error msgs?

 lisitsyn1	votjakovr: HeikoS: looks like a crash for me
 lisitsyn1	could be that I mean
-!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: @sonney2k, thoralf
 votjakovr	lisitsyn1: I think so, but I when run this test manually and it doesn't report anything
 votjakovr	lisitsyn1: I mean segfaults, etc
-!- Netsplit over, joins: @sonney2k, thoralf
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: do we have group lasso in shogun?
@HeikoS	and in particular, group lasso for logistic regression (aka classification) ?
@HeikoS	sonne|work, sonney2k ^
 sonne|work	HeikoS: IIRC lisitsyn added that last year
-!- sonney2k [~shogun@7nn.de] has quit [Ping timeout: 270 seconds]
-!- sonney2k [~shogun@7nn.de] has joined #shogun
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: yes multiclass group lasso is here
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1: which class?
@HeikoS	and: does it work? :D
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/MulticlassTreeGuidedLogisticRegression.cpp
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: in general it is tree group lasso
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: well I hope it works
@HeikoS	no documentation  ....
@HeikoS	which algorithm is implemented in there?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: algorithm of learning?
@HeikoS	so is it based on the multiclass framework and does OvO ?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: OvR
@HeikoS	and how is the lasso problem solved
@HeikoS	okay so its core is logistic regression I guess?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: euclidean projection
 lisitsyn1	IIRC it is called that
@HeikoS	where did you take this from?
@HeikoS	where is the algorithm described?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/manual.pdf
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: tree_mcLogisticR
@HeikoS	cool thanks!
@HeikoS	maybe this should be noted in the shogun documentation
@HeikoS	otherwise no-one will ever use it
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: optimization wise it is some moreau-yosida proximal stuff
@HeikoS	especially in case you suddenly die ;)
 lisitsyn1	implemented in the 'altra' function
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: so basically accelerated projected gradient descend or so
@HeikoS	lisitsyn1:  is there an example how to use it?
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: let me check
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/examples/undocumented/python_modular/classifier_featureblock_logistic_regression.py
 lisitsyn1	like that
@HeikoS	cool thanks!
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: the group stuff is the same
@HeikoS	so this block stuff defines the groups?
 lisitsyn1	yes
@HeikoS	I in fact never used such methods, so forgive me my stupid questions
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: haha no that's good question because API is stupid
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: you want to regularize groups of features right?
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	Let me explain the problem:
 lisitsyn1	like L1 of (L2 of (1,2,3)) + (L2 of (4,5,6))
@HeikoS	maybe you have an idea
@HeikoS	I have a dataset
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: ah wait
@HeikoS	it consists of frequency measurements of the brain - with a few hundred sensors
 lisitsyn1	do you need multiclass
@HeikoS	yes
 lisitsyn1	or binary?
 lisitsyn1	alright
@HeikoS	the sensors are place on the head of a guy
 lisitsyn1	HeikoS: unfortunately I'd have to ask you to try and let me know if it produces something unreasonable
@HeikoS	haha ok
 lisitsyn1	ok lets continue
 lisitsyn1	so each feature is
-!- lisitsyn1 is now known as lisitsyn
 lisitsyn	ampl of some frequency
 lisitsyn	?
@HeikoS	yes, its preprocessed I have  the FFt coefficients
@HeikoS	I want to group sensors
 lisitsyn	do you have groups of sensors?
 lisitsyn	or do you want to group them?
@HeikoS	makes sense to group them
@HeikoS	the resulting weights are probably sparse
@HeikoS	but the sparsity structure depends on the sensor positions
@HeikoS	so I want to try to learn this
 lisitsyn	hmm can you group sensors into some hierarchy?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it is important to have these groups already
 lisitsyn	it can't learn the groups itself
@HeikoS	i know thats fine
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: so the simplest way to go is
 lisitsyn	let me check
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: root is all features
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: tree = IndexBlockTree(IndexBlock(0,n_features))
 lisitsyn	then if you want no L2 of all features do tree.get_root_block.set_weight(0.0)
 lisitsyn	and then
@HeikoS	whats the difference between IndexBlockGroup and tree?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just how they treat the IndexBlock
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I mean Tree uses subblocks as childs
 lisitsyn	Group is just a set of blocks
@HeikoS	so if I have indices
@HeikoS	[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
@HeikoS	and I want groups
@HeikoS	[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8,9]
 lisitsyn	the code will be
 lisitsyn	tree = IndexBlockTree(IndexBlock(0,10))
 lisitsyn	tree.get_root_block().add_subblock(IndexBlock(0,3))
 lisitsyn	tree.get_root_block().add_subblock(IndexBlock(3,6))
 lisitsyn	tree.get_root_block().add_subblock(IndexBlock(6,10))
 lisitsyn	that's tree
 lisitsyn	root        [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
 lisitsyn	children [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8,9]
@HeikoS	and I want the regulariser to be \lambda \sum ||groups||_2
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: I didn't implement pure group lasso but tree lasso
 lisitsyn	so you have to put weights here
@HeikoS	ok, can I simulate this?
@HeikoS	okay
 lisitsyn	yes
@HeikoS	how? :)
 lisitsyn	just set the weight of root to 0
-!- iglesiasg [c1934d16@gateway/web/freenode/ip.193.147.77.22] has quit [Ping timeout: 250 seconds]
 lisitsyn	and you get L1/L2
 lisitsyn	otherwise you get L1/L2 of groups
 lisitsyn	plus L2 of all features
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	tree.get_root_block.set_weight(0.0)
@HeikoS	nice
-!- mode/#shogun [+o sonney2k] by ChanServ
@HeikoS	btw, this should really be documented somewhere (sorry to be annoying :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: really ugly API
@HeikoS	why?
 lisitsyn	I want to do something with it but don't know what
@HeikoS	its fine
@HeikoS	just one needs to share the knowledge on how to use it
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: about its working capabilities
 lisitsyn	I *know* binary thing works
 lisitsyn	can't say that about multiclass tree thing though
 lisitsyn	but I will be able to find a bug rather quick
@HeikoS	if binary works and it uses the multoclass framework than it should be fine right?
@HeikoS	but there are also multinomial formulations of this
@HeikoS	anyway
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no that's different solvers
@HeikoS	I am glad there is something
@HeikoS	really?
@HeikoS	I see
@HeikoS	did you ever test it?
@HeikoS	like on a toy multiclass problem
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: yes I tried to use it on road signs data
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, HeikoS - that you are both here. When do we put up a workshop schedule?
@sonney2k	I mean finalize the schedule!
 lisitsyn	where HoG cells are groups
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, did it improve anything?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: it produced reasonable results but worse than SVM
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no became worse
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yeah as expected :D
@sonney2k	MKL is just crap
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: too many parameters (each group has weight)
@sonney2k	complex crap
 lisitsyn	haha yes
@sonney2k	HeikoS, lisitsyn workshop!
 lisitsyn	everything complex sucks it seems
@sonney2k	1 month
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: yes yes
 lisitsyn	what's about it?
@sonney2k	we need to fix the schedule

@HeikoS	I can do that
@HeikoS	do we have a list of people that want to talk about things?

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, HeikoS so what should be the topics?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, it looks like lots of people want MMD/HSIC :)
@HeikoS	sonney2k: can do :)
@HeikoS	I will do the vote list tomorrow
@sonney2k	van51, around?
 van51	sonney2k: yeap
@sonney2k	van51, could you make sense of what I wrote yesterday about dotfeatures?
 van51	sonney2k: yea
 van51	sonney2k: by reading it on the logs
@sonney2k	and how to do the CHashedDocFeatures / CHashedDocPreprocessor
@sonney2k	(Doc is not the best word but no idea what else to use)
@sonney2k	van51, I think this is no more than 1 day of work for you BTW
 van51	sonney2k: question, the preprocessor can be used offline?
@sonney2k	van51, offline as in?
@sonney2k	not sure what you mean
 van51	I mean use it with a file as input and a file as output
 votjakovr	HeikoS: I've found that difference between a and b in compare function in tester.py approx. 10e-12 on test that gives empty diff
 van51	and then read that file through a load method
 van51	or something
@sonney2k	van51, ohh actually preprocessor won't work - you need a converter
@HeikoS	votjakovr: say again, I did not get that
@sonney2k	van51, ok one step back. which interface do you intend to use?
@sonney2k	pure C++?
 van51	sonney2k: yea
@sonney2k	or e.g. python_modular
@sonney2k	van51, ok then well you can create your stringcharfeatures
@sonney2k	load some strings from disk
@sonney2k	and then apply a converter to convert them to DenseFeatures
@sonney2k	since it is all about wordcounts you can use uint16_t or int32_t
@sonney2k	for dense features
@sonney2k	so you would convert StringFeatures<char> -> CDenseFeatures<int32_t> in your converter
@sonney2k	and then of course you can print the whole matrix
 van51	sonney2k: ah yea
 votjakovr	HeikoS: I've changed implementation of exact inference method a little bit. Python integration test gives an error and empty diff. I've found that that the difference between a and b in compare function in tester.py approx. 10e-12
 van51	sonney2k: this sounds ok to me
@sonney2k	hmmhh maybe CSparseFeatures<int32_t> is better considering that you use hashes :)
 van51	sonney2k: I am not sure that the vector will be sparse
@sonney2k	van51, it will be: look
@sonney2k	hash(word1) -> some large int
@sonney2k	and you do this for all words in the docuemnt
@sonney2k	so depending on the number of bits you use for your hash
 van51	sonney2k: yes but from what I understand it's for dimensionality reduction and afterwards you mod that number to a specific range 0...d
@sonney2k	say 20
@sonney2k	you have a 1048576 dimensional vector you create of a text document
@sonney2k	van51, well if you specify number of bits to be say 8
@sonney2k	then it will be dense
@sonney2k	but we the more bits we can afford the better the results
@sonney2k	so it is usually sparse
@sonney2k	IIRC spam filters use sth like 32bit
 van51	sonney2k: ok, got it
 votjakovr	HeikoS: May be it's better to regenerate test data?
@sonney2k	van51, anyway you should really get started with that
 van51	sonney2k: I will today
 van51	sonney2k: btw since we're at it
 van51	sonney2k: how do I specify the number of bits in the hashes from CHash?
 van51	hash functions*
@sonney2k	van51, well just use bitwise &
@sonney2k	as in x & ((1<<8)-1)
@sonney2k	would give you an 8 bit hash
@sonney2k	and btw use murmurhash3
 van51	sonney2k: ok I will
 van51	sonney2k: thanks, you've been really helpful :)

@sonney2k	van51, bad news is that it is not easy to fix
 van51	sonney2k: what is it?
@sonney2k	it is indeed the conversion to SGSparseVector and reference counting
@sonney2k	the correct patch will be very intrusive
@sonney2k	no idea what it will break besides that but I suspect serialization and lots of other stuff
@sonney2k	so I will need HeikoS help then too
@sonney2k	van51, ok let me try...
 van51	sonney2k: good luck :)
-!- vgorbati [~vgorbati@212.2.159.34] has joined #shogun

@HeikoS	votjakovr:  looking...
@sonney2k	van51, no it is the whole CSparseFeatureMatrix class
 votjakovr	HeikoS: thanks :)
@sonney2k	van51, it needs to be converted to internally use SGSparseMatrix
@HeikoS	sonney2k: reference counting for sparse vectors?
@sonney2k	van51, otherwise refcounts are kaboom
@sonney2k	HeikoS, we have that already
@sonney2k	HeikoS, but SGSparseMatrix is not yet used and I will need help with serialization support for that
@HeikoS	sonney2k: I see
@HeikoS	who wnats to have that?
@sonney2k	HeikoS, sorry what?

@HeikoS	when my evil-nano-robots conquered the planet
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes it is now that you have lots of time
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: haha ok!
@sonney2k	once you become as old as me you would wish you would have spent your lots and lots of time you had more wisely :D
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: tell me what I should spend it on then!
@sonney2k	doing cool stuff
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: haha!
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so of course working on shogun :D
@sonney2k	or HeikoS nano robots
@sonney2k	but powered by shogun
@HeikoS	of course they are
@sonney2k	hmmhh
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: let see what you say when you turn 50
@HeikoS	they are in fact powered on unit-tests
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, hey I am not there yet
 lisitsyn	I will turn like 36
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	I first have to survive this decade
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: oh I'll turn your current year when you turn 50
@sonney2k	what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: when you are 50 I am 36
@sonney2k	HeikoS, lisitsyn does anyone use get_feature from our features? and the on-the-fly preprocessors?
@HeikoS	I dont know
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I never used on-the-fly thing
@sonney2k	I used to use them but haven't for a long time
 lisitsyn	well it may be a good thing but
 lisitsyn	something is wrong
@sonney2k	it was working when I wrote it - I made sure
@sonney2k	but now with all that refactoring and no tests
@sonney2k	no idea
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no it works I think
 lisitsyn	I mean something is wrong with its api and etc
 lisitsyn	it is not attractive to use
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: see a big shot in our list
@sonney2k	what woudl you do better?
@sonney2k	it is very easy to do
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: if I had idea I would do that or say :)
@sonney2k	just attach a list of preprocessors
@sonney2k	done
 lisitsyn	I usually say I don't like X because I don't know how to improve it
@sonney2k	no idea how it could be even easier
@sonney2k	I am a bit worried about the Cache in all this
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I'd like to drop some code
 lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, do you know some LRU cache?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: basics - never implemented
 lisitsyn	you mean implementation?
@sonney2k	I would rather use some well written thing and drop ours

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: error msgs fixed for complex64_t, unit-tests added
@sonney2k	yeah something we could use
 lisitsyn	lets google
@sonney2k	HeikoS, you do that on purpose do you? Just when I branched you mega merge
@HeikoS	ehm?
@HeikoS	what?
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: a lot of implementations
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: what is it for?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, our on-the-fly preprocessors use a cache to cache feature vectors
@sonney2k	preprocessed ones I mean
 lisitsyn	sounds complex!
@sonney2k	I know you never used it but our DenseFeatures don't have to be in memory
 lisitsyn	haha yes I know
 lisitsyn	but never tried
@HeikoS	I gotta go now
@HeikoS	see you guys tomorrow!

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, could you please change this to 1e-14 http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/bsd1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1078/steps/test/logs/stdio
@sonney2k	looks like fabs is b0rken in old libc's
@lisitsyn	crazy precision
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, why?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am scaried what these guys are going to compute
@lisitsyn	intergalactic spaceships
@lisitsyn	or what
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I was already scared when I read the proposal
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I believe they are going to compute 4d space warping to fly away from this planet
@sonney2k	*yay* it is becoming kind of summer here :D
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: bayessian theoretical aspects of teleportation
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: we should ask if nasa uses such a precision
@lisitsyn	they must be e-3 most of the times
@lisitsyn	:D
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, only our SVMs are 1e-3
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: what about the others?
@lisitsyn	oops I am into merging issue
