 monalisag	Hello, I wanted to know some details about the project Large Scale Learning & Dimension reduction using hashing.
 monalisag	In the project descrption it isnt mentioned but is this method anyway related to locality sensitive hashing ?

 sonne|work	monalisag: a little bit maybe.
 sonne|work	monalisag: it is not about designing a hash though
 sonne|work	but more to just use a fast one to reduce #dims
 sonne|work	and one is totally ignorant about hash collisions etc\
 monalisag	part of my work for this project would be to explore the kind of hashing function we can use ?
 monalisag	or i have to use the already implemented CHash class for this purpose ?
 sonne|work	monalisag: it would only involve using the hash function 'MurmurHash3'
 sonne|work	which is already in CHash yes
 sonne|work	monalisag: it is more about defining certain type of DotFeature derived classes that use this compression
 sonne|work	e.g. you could think of n-grams and bag of words (text documents) that you could hash
 sonne|work	or e.g. quadratic (or higher order) polynomial features
 sonne|work	monalisag: so one can do real large scale *non-linear* learning by computing features on-the-fly
 sonne|work	for example I have used this to detect splice sites on DNA
 monalisag	got it. thanks :)
 monalisag	one more thing. Should I look into Vowpal Wabbit and see how they use this on-the-fly hashing trick ?
 sonne|work	so one could do fancy applications with it w/o requiring lots of memory etc
 sonne|work	monalisag: no need to do this
 sonne|work	shogun does this too
 sonne|work	as soon as you implement the functions in CDotFeatures
 sonne|work	vw & liblinear & ocas & sgd etc will use the on-the-fly features
 monalisag	for the tokenizing purposes can i take inspiration from scikit or some other library which performs similar job ?

 sonne|work	monalisag: it has to be C/C++ code though. Recall that this is called billions of times
 monalisag	I would be implementing the code myself but I would like to explore how they(other libraries) have made their code efficient in cases where the text corpuses are huge.
 sonne|work	monalisag: sure. It is not limited to text though. But we will have to focus on a few domains otherwise this is getting too much.
 sonne|work	maybe with some nice application

 thoralf	Hey there.
 sonne|work	thoralf: hey
 thoralf	sonne|work: I just committed my hack - but I did not check if it has side effects.
 thoralf	sonne|work: Is there some kind of unit or regression testing?
 sonne|work	thoralf: yes. Might be though that we don't have any for streaming features
 sonne|work	in any case this will either work or crash(tm)
 thoralf	And how can someone run the tests locally?  I didn't find anything in the documentation...

 monalisag	hey, could you redirect me to a source where I can read about quadritic feature hashing ?
 sonne|work	monalisag: it is a one-liner: hash(idx) and idx follows some enumeration of the features, e.g. when you have x_i i=0,1,2 you could have x_0, x_1, x_3 and x_0 x_1, x_0 x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1 x_3
 sonne|work	scratch the last :) there is no x_3 :)

 ozan	I am currently writing a proposal for GSOC 2013
 ozan	already submitted a patch today https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1046
 ozan	and contacted with potential mentor (Vojtech)
 ozan	is there anything else I need to do after submitting my proposal to GSOC 2013
@iglesiasg	ozan: I think your PR is against master, isn't it?
 ozan	yes should I change ?
 ozan	is there any specific branch for that

@iglesiasg	ozan: see the comment here for example https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/1044
 ozan	and is there any other QDA example/application that I can test
@iglesiasg	ozan: there ara QDA examples in examples/undocumented/python_modular and libshogun too
 ozan	I already used them
 ozan	ok I am fixing
@iglesiasg	ozan: I took a quick look to your PR
@iglesiasg	ozan: one comment is that the idea of using Eigen was not because of using their structures but mainly to avoid loops in the computations and so on
@iglesiasg	ozan: maybe I am wrong, but it looks to me like you have kept most of the loops
 ozan	except the one of them yes I keep them all
 ozan	issue is that I first wanted to get working example
@iglesiasg	ozan: sure, good idea
 ozan	after finishing my application to GSOC 2013 I am planning to solve that loops
 ozan	since deadline is today I wanted to have working patch :)
@iglesiasg	ok
 ozan	I think I can solve loops and prepare a new pull request next week

@iglesiasg	ozan: there is also another PR someone sent with Eigen for QDA, you might want to take a look
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: how many do you guess at the end of the day?
 sonne|work	I was estimating 30
 sonne|work	and yesterday 35
@iglesiasg	haha ok no more estimates then
 sonne|work	now maybe 40
@iglesiasg	I think 40 for sure
 sonne|work	IDK
 sonne|work	we had 48 last year
 sonne|work	so almost no difference then
@iglesiasg	good
 ozan	I have not seen that PR yet. I can merge my code with the PR you mentioned
@iglesiasg	sonne|work: it would be pretty good if we get the same #slots
 sonne|work	yeah but we cannot count on it

 ozan	?

@iglesiasg	ozan: I think it is better if you check GSoC's FAQ or the many mails that have been regarding that topic in GSoC's ML

 sonne|work	I would prefer 42
 sonne|work	but ok qpsize in SVMLight is set to 41
 sonne|work	simply because of some theorem that could prove convergence for odd numbers :D
@wiking	sonne|work: ok got a sec?
 sonne|work	sec yes
@wiking	sonne|work: ok
@wiking	sonne|work: what should we do with the PRNG try
@wiking	keep it or drop it?
 sonne|work	test it and merge it
@wiking	since it did not really fix our integration problem :(
 sonne|work	not all of it
@wiking	sonne|work: ok then before doing that i'll add dSFMT
@wiking	so that we can generate random float vectors fast
 sonne|work	but even having a re-entrant rng is very worth having!
@wiking	my only concern is
@wiking	that for each random generation whether it's only a number or an array of randoms
@wiking	we have an SG_REF/SG_UNREF pair
@wiking	which is a bit of an overhead
 sonne|work	wiking: btw could you please merge master into develop? I accidentally merged one commit into master...
@wiking	maybe i should just use it w/o the get_global_rand() and define it as extern

@wiking	there's some other stuff on my todo list

@wiking	sonne|work: you mean SG_REF/UNREF ?
 sonne|work	c'mon sleep is overrated

@wiking	oooor
@wiking	i mean to be honest
@wiking	we could have 2 SFMT structs in the clas
@wiking	class
@wiking	and then we dont need to reinit it
@wiking	it's not thaaaat big of a struct that it would start eating the memory like crazy
@wiking	:P
@wiking	1 sfmt for 32 bits and 1 sfmt for 64 bits
@wiking	sonne|work: your 2 cents on this one?
@wiking	basically sfmt_32 and sfmt_64. inited once and that's all
@wiking	and have dsfmt for the doubles
 sonne|work	yeah why not. but you would init them with the same seed for the non-thread safe api
@wiking	sonne|work: yep
@wiking	everything the same
@wiking	just that we dont have to reinit each time when we change state

 vgorbati	lisitsyn: hi, here?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: hey, yes
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I have finally started working on implementation, and I am looking through your code to find how to construct matrices of distances and angles to neighbors. It looks like using SparseTriplet's is the way?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes that's the fastest way
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, then what I can't get, is why are you reserving space for (k+1)^2 values per row? I thought that there would only k-values (1 for each neighbor) per row..
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: in lle?
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: yes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: if we put these weights per row
@lisitsyn	we get the W matrix
@lisitsyn	but later we need WW'
@lisitsyn	so I just form WW' here
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: got it. btw, then it looks like there is a small typo in locally_linear.hpp at line 31: should be sparse_triplets.reserve((k*k+2*k+1)*(end-begin));

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, as in likely more slots yes but c'mon where is that rush coming from
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: some of them are kind of desperate
 gsomix	waiting for many last-femtosecond-proposals
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, my theory now is that people since they are only allowed to apply for 5 (instead of 20) projects, are more carefully selecting projects
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: it's my pleasure:) I am also wondering, is the '#pragma omp parallel'  this 'OpenMP' parallelism that is mentioned on ideas page?
@sonney2k	and not do it in the very beginning
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: yes that's openmp
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah they don't spread
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: I guess I should also use it?
@lisitsyn	it is not like fishing now
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, btw do you know how one can stop the running openmp threads?
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: serial first!
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: ok, better for me)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: from the outer code?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: *never ever* write parallel code without serial ;)
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: ehmm some flag may be
 vgorbati	lisitsyn: got it, sensei:) I just thought that the problem is quite the same
@lisitsyn	vgorbati: openmp can be surprising hard to debug sometimes
@lisitsyn	well once you get used to it it is easy though
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: any way to do that with pthreads?
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: it doesn't sound like a good practice for me actually

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, I have no idea how this could work with openmp
@lisitsyn	52
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, looks like it is not possible http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8265191/force-closing-a-thread-using-openmp-in-c
@sonney2k	but hey what we could do is install a signal handler
@sonney2k	set some global variable
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: yeah nothing really impossible
@sonney2k	and then poll this variable
@sonney2k	the only problem with the signal handler is that it is not allowed to run in thread context
@sonney2k	so it must run in the main thread
@sonney2k	and it is also not clear what happens if the other threads finish before we get user input

 naywhayare	I have worked with many open source solutions wile creating my projects.Some of them are:MS SQL Server

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31480471/gsoc2013-applications.png
@lisitsyn	crazy curve
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, compare to last year http://shogun-toolbox.org/page/Events/gsoc2012
@lisitsyn	quite similar?
 naywhayare	lisitsyn: 41
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: quite a lot too
 naywhayare	the majority came in during the past hour
 naywhayare	the curve probably looks about the same as what sonney2k posted
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, not at all
@sonney2k	last year was 48
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: our last minute proposals are like spam
 naywhayare	many posit that they can solve extremely difficult publication-worthy problems without any supporting evidence whatsoever...
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, exactly. In our first year we made the mistake not to require a code contribution
@sonney2k	so we had 70 or so proposals
@lisitsyn	haha
@sonney2k	kind of exponential growth
 naywhayare	I might try requiring a patch next year, but them I imagine I'd have to sort through numerous patches that probably don't even work
 naywhayare	s/them/then/
@sonney2k	naywhayare, yes that's the price
@sonney2k	but you know then who is good
@sonney2k	naywhayare, btw you still have until may 22 to decide
@sonney2k	so you should really require from every student you consider some kind of code contribution
@sonney2k	this way you become very sure if the student can do the job

@lisitsyn	naywhayare: yeah you'd better have to
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: but you'll have time to finally settle it
 naywhayare	okay, that's good
 naywhayare	I definitely have a few students who I'd like to get in further touch with, so I am glad I have a few weeks to do that
@lisitsyn	naywhayare: what is the number of slots you'd like to have?
 naywhayare	it depends on what my mentors want.  we could do up to 6 but I've been told to not expect more than 1 or 2 during the first year
 naywhayare	so in that sense it depends more on google than the other mentors...
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am going to send a welcome letters
@lisitsyn	for the workshop
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: y/n?
@sonney2k	naywhayare, yeah first year is usually no more than 2
@sonney2k	so you have to make tough choices
@sonney2k	in very rare circumstances up to 5
@sonney2k	but still <10% acceptance...
 naywhayare	yeah, 2 is about what I'm expecting.  based on the ratings it looks like we have 2 or 3 standout students and 7 or 8 who could be reasonable
 naywhayare	anyway, I have to run for now... thanks for the advice :)
