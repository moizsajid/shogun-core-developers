 supernaught	hi all
 supernaught	I was wondering if someone could explain something to a machine learning newb
 supernaught	I am having difficulty in understanding how I could translate the simple examples to a definite example I can understand
 supernaught	such as:   I provide a set of letters from group A,    I provide a set of letters from group B,   I ask shogun whether a letter (not explicitly in either group) which group it would best fit
 supernaught	An example in the tutorial, (third one from top at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/doc/en/current/developer_tutorial.html ), spits out info like:
 supernaught	output[1] = -0.9997
 supernaught	output[2] = 1.00003  , etc..
 supernaught	how should I interpret these numbers?
 supernaught	Checking the doxygen documentation made things much worse. I see descriptions for "CLabels" like:  "The class Labels models labels, i.e. class assignments of objects." which entirely avoids the question of *what* exactly a label is.
 supernaught	Is there a manual (or a soft introduction) kicking around somewhere which I could parse? I've been attempting to figure out the examples for a few days now :)
 supernaught	I'll hang around here for a while.
 supernaught	:)
 supernaught	I should also mention I have watched the videos posted on the shogun website.

@sonney2k	supernaught, well use the signum of these numbers
@sonney2k	e.g. if the sign is negative then it is a letter from group A
@sonney2k	if positve then from group B
@sonney2k	that's how the ocr digit example on the homepage was done
@sonney2k	using a SVM + gaussian kernel
