 wiking	heiko: yo
 heiko	wiking, hi
 wiking	blackburn: there's a llp  question for ya on the mailing list :P
 heiko	blackburn, seems like this guys complains about your math :D
 wiking	heiko: i've fixed some stuff in the streaming features but i think it would still need some reviews... the code is a bit messy
 heiko	wiking, yes I saw that, I will have a look soon
 heiko	what exactly did you do?
 heiko	and what exactly is messy?
 wiking	heiko: well i've removed already a lot of empty functions
 wiking	like ctors and init functions that didn't really do anything
 heiko	wiking, yes the streaming features are not really mature yet
 blackburn	heiko: well Largest instead of Smallest is not the issue
 wiking	i've got a valgridn leak error from the same person: http://pastebin.com/eA28DiFn
 blackburn	he should learn arpack first :D
 heiko	one has to be careful though, because of this pthread stuff
 heiko	blackburn, yes I wasnt saying he is right :D
 wiking	heiko: but since my valgrind is not really reliable on my machine it'd be good that somebody else checks it out
 heiko	wiking, ok
 wiking	but yeah now it's less leaky ;P
 heiko	I was planning of working on that a bit on the weekend
 heiko	first weak of job, so loads of things to do
 wiking	that's alright
 wiking	i was just saying
 heiko	wiking, thanks for doing that
 heiko	the streaming features are a mess
 heiko	I also broke the VW framework while working on them
 wiking	hehehe
