@sonney2k	18 C - freezing
 blackburn	sonney2k: you could warm up berlin with your macbook
 gsomix	We are using air conditioning at home. But the outside is very bad to work.
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you manage to look at the java examples?
 blackburn	sonney2k: going to test all of them today
@sonney2k	ok
@sonney2k	and gsomix despite the wheather how is wresting with C5.0 going?
 gsomix	I'm working on some data structures now. Blackburn and I have no idea how to integrate c5.0. =___=

 gsomix	sonney2k, only on my hard disk. If I understand the phrase.
@sonney2k	gsomix, mind pushing it to github such that I can have a look?
 blackburn	I guess he have nothing to push yet
 blackburn	with C5.0 I mean
 blackburn	DORGQR!
 gsomix	Only source code of C5.0. No more.
 gsomix	sonney2k, send the code of C5.0 to github? Specify.
@sonney2k	gsomix, I meant you have a local branch w/ c5.0 that you could just push - but it seems not.
@sonney2k	so forget it
 gsomix	Ok.
 blackburn	sonney2k: ok to merge? https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/230/files
@sonney2k	blackburn, you have the OK from the author or where does this come from?
 blackburn	sonney2k: he rewrote it ;)
@sonney2k	seriously?
 blackburn	gsomix: did you?
 gsomix	yep
 blackburn	sonney2k: so I guess no license issues
@sonney2k	true then
@sonney2k	lots of work ...
 blackburn	it could speed up isomap when I use it for dijkstra
 blackburn	sonney2k: could you merge it? I'm messed with some QR now
 blackburn	sonney2k: ah, nevermind, I'll do
 blackburn	gtg
 gsomix	sonney2k, all ok? could you merge it?

 blackburn	okay let the great java test begin
@sonney2k	gsomix, thanks

@sonney2k	blackburn, congrats
@sonney2k	blackburn, is java loadmatrix working or not?
 blackburn	sonney2k: it is ok, I was wrong
-!- serialhex_ is now known as serialhex
@sonney2k	k
 blackburn	when printing
 blackburn	it produces strange output
@sonney2k	you mean toString()
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	println, yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: difficult to compare randomized algo like landmarkisomap :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, why?
 blackburn	how can I fix landmarks if they are all random
@sonney2k	blackburn, there is no randomness in this world
@sonney2k	just init the rnd generator with the same seed
@sonney2k	CMath::init_random
 blackburn	sonney2k: I just ran all of examples without > /dev/null -- looks pathetic
@sonney2k	blackburn, which means?
 blackburn	many asserts fail
@sonney2k	great
 blackburn	will check regression now
@sonney2k	blackburn, so lets concentrate on simple examples first
@sonney2k	features_*
 blackburn	hm okay
@sonney2k	you should check if you can get/set features and result is the OK
* sonney2k was afraid of that
 blackburn	sonney2k: ufff just take a look at features_simple_modular.java
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes?
 blackburn	aren't you getting confused with adding a matrix asList?
@sonney2k	blackburn, you mean this Arrays.asList(A) ?
@sonney2k	looks weird indeed
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes
 blackburn	uh oh
@sonney2k	better use an ArrayList of DoubleMatrix
 blackburn	I guess Arrays.asList(A) doesn't produce doublematrix
 blackburn	okay I'll just try to set/get features
 blackburn	sonney2k: any way to map from "get_feature_matrix" style to "getFeatureMatrix" style automagically?
@sonney2k	blackburn, no
 blackburn	sad
@sonney2k	I don't thinks os
@sonney2k	so
 blackburn	sonney2k:ok, set/get RealFeatures - works
@sonney2k	I know this is troublesome for pure java people but at least for me having to program in python java etc etc - I will die
@sonney2k	ok - at least
@sonney2k	blackburn, next level would be a kernel matrix / distance matrix
 blackburn	I guess I have to rewrite simple features test
 blackburn	and then distance,yes
 blackburn	sonney2k: is it ok to use DoubleMatrix everywhere?
@sonney2k	blackburn, jblas simply doesn't support other data types than float/double
@sonney2k	so it is the only way to 'emulate' other types - so yes
 blackburn	so, e.g. new bytefeatures(doublematrix) is ok?
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	other things will only work with ujmp
@sonney2k	s/other things/native types/
 blackburn	I see
@sonney2k	blackburn, so do kernels work?
 blackburn	not tested yet

 blackburn	sonney2k: looks like it is ok with gaussian kernel
@sonney2k	hurray - at least sth
@sonney2k	blackburn, next level classifier svm + kernel
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	not, sth is wrong
 blackburn	I replaced data with
 blackburn	2.0 2.0
 blackburn	3.0 3.0
 blackburn	2.5 2.5
 blackburn	in python got
 blackburn	[[ 1.          0.82505297  0.38230427]
 blackburn	 [ 0.82505297  1.          0.46336937]
 blackburn	 [ 0.38230427  0.46336937  1.        ]]
 blackburn	in java
 blackburn	[1.0, 0.3823042728920807, 0.3823042728920807;
 blackburn	0.3823042728920807, 1.0, 0.6807123983233854;

-!- blackburn was kicked from #shogun by bettyboo [flood]
-!- blackburn [~blackburn@188.122.239.253] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	sonney2k: ^
@sonney2k	blackburn, please check if features are indeed the same after you got the kernel matrix
@sonney2k	sth like
@sonney2k	kernel.get_lhs().get_feature_matrix()
 blackburn	sonney2k: trouble is get_lhs return features..
@sonney2k	blackburn, ahh yes true - that is troublesome under python
@sonney2k	then just check if the features you create still contain the values
 blackburn	sonney2k: hmm it is ok
 blackburn	I guess 'reshape' works different in java and python
@sonney2k	both in java and python?
@sonney2k	reshape?
@sonney2k	what for?
 blackburn	load uses it
 blackburn	yes, different way of reshape
 blackburn	*very* strange way of reshape in java
 blackburn	2.0 2.0
 blackburn	3.0 3.0
 blackburn	2.5 2.5
 blackburn	in python:
 blackburn	[[ 2.   2.   3. ]
 blackburn	 [ 3.   2.5  2.5]]
 blackburn	in java
 blackburn	[2.0, 2.5, 3.0; 3.0, 2.0, 2.5]
@sonney2k	what is the input?
 blackburn	2.0 2.0
 blackburn	3.0 3.0
 blackburn	2.5 2.5
 blackburn	I modified fm_train_real.dat
@sonney2k	how can that be reshaped?
@sonney2k	it is a matrix already?!
@sonney2k	shouldn't this be transposed?
 blackburn	no, it reads not matrix but vector I guess
 blackburn	just take a look how it works in python and java
 blackburn	Load.java and load.py or so
@sonney2k	blackburn, looks like the python thing is totally broken
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	surprise!
@sonney2k	it should be numpy.loadtxt('../data/fm_train_real.dat').T
@sonney2k	instead of whatever is done in load_numbers
 blackburn	wonderful
@sonney2k	I now understand why this happened
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	at some point we had data in matlab compatible format
@sonney2k	ascii format
@sonney2k	that means one example == one column
@sonney2k	but this is stupid for ascii
@sonney2k	so we transposed this
@sonney2k	but the python function was never changed obviously
 blackburn	sonney2k: so, what should I/you do?
@sonney2k	blackburn, please go on
 blackburn	sonney2k: with java?
@sonney2k	sure

@sonney2k	blackburn, my guess is you need to transpose not reshape
* sonney2k wonders if blackburn needs some more fuel
@sonney2k	aka the V-word
 blackburn	why I need? :(

@sonney2k	at least google finds me everything I need
 blackburn	yes yes
@sonney2k	and?
@sonney2k	does it now return the same thing?
 blackburn	I'm such a stupid russian okay :D

 blackburn	sonney2k: toString in println! such a useless thing. everywhere
@sonney2k	blackburn, is this automagically called?
 blackburn	of course it is
@sonney2k	I know it is in python when __str__ or __repr__ is there
@sonney2k	ok
 blackburn	yes, just like in python
@sonney2k	anyway, please call some libsvm classifier thingy
@sonney2k	that should be easy enough to see if things work at all
 blackburn	now try gaussian naive bayes, then libsvm
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	hm gaussian naive bayes is broken I gues
 blackburn	s
 blackburn	sonney2k: libsvm minimal produces ~0.08 mean error both for java and python
@sonney2k	blackburn, please compare label - outputs not just accuracy
@sonney2k	label outputs must match exactly
