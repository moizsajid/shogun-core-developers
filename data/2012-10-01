 yoo	hi all
 yoo	could someone explain me the way string features are handle/compute ?
 yoo	I ve seen table for conversin bin <--> uchar
 yoo	what's the use of "1 << (sizeof(uint8_t)*8)"
@sonney2k	yoo, bitmasking magic
 yoo	sonney2k: yea =) is there any documentation on string features implementation details ?
@sonney2k	yoo, only in my head. what do you want to know?
 yoo	I would like to experiment string kernels with bigger dictionnary than RAWDIGIT and high order too
 yoo	maybe I can add my own preprocess to help those computations
 yoo	investigating the problem ..
@sonney2k	yoo, hmmhh how big is the dictionary?
 yoo	let's say 1000 words
@sonney2k	yoo, well you could use stringwordfeatures for that
@sonney2k	for any higher order business I would recommend to create some hashed string features either as extra object or on-the-fly
 yoo	stringwordfeatuers ? u mean CSortWordString ?
@sonney2k	yoo, no. CStringFeatures<uint16_t>
 yoo	well yes I already use those features
 yoo	but limited with RAWBIT alphabet
 yoo	there should be something I misunderstand . For example, the CCommWordStringKernel : when you pass a list of string and an alphabet : strings are stored and histogram (order 1) is computed.
 yoo	If you want order two histogram: you need to call obtain_for_char() and then run the sort preprocess. right ?

 yoo	sonney2k, what append if I created stringfeatures using constructor taking SGStringList<uint64_t> and Ealphabet RAWBYTE in arguments. there are no enough symbols in the dictionnary to represent list of string containing values in [0,1000] for exmaple.
 yoo	sonney2k: what should be done then ?
 yoo	blackburn: Hi, is has been a while .. didnt had the time to PR the mkl patch .. sorry, I will do this week!
 blackburn	yoo: hey
 blackburn	no problem, any time is ok
 yoo	blackburn: and thx again for the vimrc config file, I am still trying to make completion working (for shogun, stl, .. ) using clang .. but seems hard!
 blackburn	yoo: why? works out of box here
 yoo	wtf ?
 yoo	:p
 blackburn	are you installing shogun to default dir?
 yoo	yes
 blackburn	strange it doesn't work oob then
 yoo	blackburn: are you aware of stringfeatures constructor which can handle dictionnay bigger than RAWBYTE (=256)
 blackburn	I don't know to be honest
 yoo	sonney2k:  for now I create stringfeatures with values \in[0,1000] but when you call constructor with alpha = RAWBYTE then only 256 symbols are used in histogram ... am I wrong ?
 yoo	maybe I miss smthg in using the stringfeatures !
