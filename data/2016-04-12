@wiking	HeikoS: hey
@wiking	HeikoS: yeah i have some other benchmarks
@wiking	to actually see where and what is happening
@wiking	btw any news on aws?
@HeikoS	wiking: what do they tell you, these other benchmarks?
@HeikoS	AWS no reply so far
@HeikoS	wiking: btw say this? https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub
@HeikoS	we might use that for our cloud, rather than the hand-written thing we have

@wiking	mmm you mean self written? :)
@wiking	because every code is handwritten so far....
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	anyhow that code is actually a fork
@wiking	of some other opensource project
@wiking	(shogun-cloud)
@wiking	it wasn't an inhouse dev
@HeikoS	ah I see
@HeikoS	ok, well this thing was just pointed out to me
@HeikoS	just wanted to share
@HeikoS	wiking: but more curious about the benchmarks
@wiking	yeah i've used perf to actually see wtf is happening
@wiking	will write as soon as i find time to write up all the things
@HeikoS	ok cool, curious about it
@HeikoS	anything striking?
@wiking	yeah
@wiking	:)
@HeikoS	cool
@wiking	that has some consequences on the whole shogun lib
@HeikoS	oh wow
@HeikoS	btw USE_GPL_SHOGUN is more or less done
@HeikoS	would be good to have a build
@HeikoS	with it turned off
@wiking	ok
@wiking	we can create a nightly job
@HeikoS	yes that should be enough
@HeikoS	I would try to push another release before gsoc with that
@wiking	yep
@HeikoS	once we have all set, we can ask everyone to help as a way to get going
@wiking	defeinitely

 AlexIalongo	Hello, does anybody use YouCompleteMe for Vim?
 AlexIalongo	If so, could you perhaps share the .ycm_extra_conf.py setup?
 AlexIalongo	lisitsyn: Hey, I saw in the IRC logs that you mention using YCM for Shogun, do you still use it?
