 KMcQuisten	Ok, so I still can't get this to work at all, blackburn.  I keep getting the same undefined symbol every single time.  Anytime I try to import modshogun.
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: workaround time?
 blackburn	:D
 KMcQuisten	I've tried to back up to previous commit tags, but I cna't even get them to compile properly to see if they fix the problem
 blackburn	rm line 4 interfaces/modular/Latent_includes.i
 KMcQuisten	Righto.  I shall try that
 blackburn	rm lines 22,28 interfaces/modular/Latent.i
 blackburn	11-13 as well
 KMcQuisten	Ok, I'll recompile and give it a shot
 KMcQuisten	If this works i'll actually get to go home tonight!  woohoo!
 wiking	blackburn: i wonder what's the difference
 blackburn	wiking: no idea :D
 wiking	blackburn: i mean Structure.i _includes.i does the same :)
 blackburn	yes
 blackburn	I just want KMcQuisten to go home tonight :D
 KMcQuisten	Hahaha!  thank you
 wiking	KMcQuisten: can you do this: in the directory where you've cloned the git repo: ls src/shogun/latent/DirectorLatentModel.cpp.o
 wiking	after you've compiled of course
 wiking	just paste here the result
 KMcQuisten	Sure thing.
 wiking	or even better: ls src/shogun/latent/DirectorLatentModel.*
 wiking	;P
 KMcQuisten	Here's what I get:
 KMcQuisten	src/shogun/latent/DirectorLatentModel.cpp  src/shogun/latent/DirectorLatentModel.cpp.o  src/shogun/latent/DirectorLatentModel.h
 wiking	mmm
 wiking	so there's object
 wiking	KMcQuisten: what os/arch r u using?
 KMcQuisten	I'm using Centos 6 on x86_64 architacture
 wiking	mmm ok
 blackburn	another one uses centos
 blackburn	and another gone and another gone
 wiking	well now u shouldn't have any problems anymore with that class since you've thrown it out from modular interface
 wiking	but i really wonder what could cause there the problem
 KMcQuisten	blackburn, what distro do you prefer?
 wiking	as for both me and blackburn it works w/o the any problems...
 KMcQuisten	Yeah, iv'e never seen anything like this before
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: no idea :)
 wiking	although i'm using python 2.7 as well
 blackburn	I use ubuntu
 wiking	but there's nothing fancy/funky about that given class
 wiking	i.e. if that fails then other classes should fail as well
 KMcQuisten	Yeah, it should work just like all the other director classes.
 wiking	indeed
 KMcQuisten	Uh oh:
 KMcQuisten	ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/_modshogun.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6shogun23CMeanShiftDataGeneratorIdE20set_mean_shift_modelEdi
 blackburn	hah
 KMcQuisten	I truly have no idea what the fuck's happening now.
 blackburn	it is implemented I am sure
 KMcQuisten	Yeah
 KMcQuisten	So let's see:  Swig problem, python problem, anything else it could be?
 blackburn	KMcQuisten: how long has it been since you last updated your git?
 blackburn	I mean shogun git
 KMcQuisten	This was with the newest pull.  I can't remember what tag I was on before.
 KMcQuisten	I did a fresh clone
 KMcQuisten	I generally pull the newest one every morning
 blackburn	my guess is that for some reason your .so file is old
 KMcQuisten	libshogun.so, or _modshogun.so?
 blackburn	may be both, no idea
 blackburn	and no idea how can that ever happen but just guess
 KMcQuisten	Righto.  I'll see what I can do
 wiking	ls -la /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/_modshogun.so
 wiking	what's the output
 KMcQuisten	-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root 27347037 Nov  5 18:11 _modshogun.so
 blackburn	not old I believe
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	mmm swig is ok
 wiking	i use 2.0.8 as well
 wiking	ok
 wiking	well then i guess it's time for checking the .so
 wiking	:D
 wiking	strings /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/_modshogun.so|grep CMeanShiftDataGenerator
 wiking	:>
 KMcQuisten	Wll that's a lot of text
 KMcQuisten	Seems to have found a lot
 wiking	:(
 KMcQuisten	Yep, there's the symbol it says it can't find
 wiking	_ZN6shogun23CMeanShiftDataGeneratorIdE20set_mean_shift_modelEdi
 wiking	?
 KMcQuisten	Yep
 blackburn	okay guys I have low battery need to sleep :)
 blackburn	see you
 KMcQuisten	gnight

 KMcQuisten	wiking:  What's it mean that it can't find a symbol that seems to be in the .so
 KMcQuisten	?
 wiking	well
 wiking	that's a really good question :S
 KMcQuisten	BWA!  Old version of libshogun.so and libshogun.sa in the lib64 folder
 KMcQuisten	.a
 KMcQuisten	let's see if getting all those fresh helps
 KMcQuisten	BOOM!  Headhsot
 KMcQuisten	Got it!
 KMcQuisten	Thanks for helping me wad through this blackburn and wiking.  You're lifesavers
 wiking	:>>.
