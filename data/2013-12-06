 sonne|work	besser82: I want my present :P
 besser82	sonne|work: I'm working on it  ;)
 besser82	sonne|work: For far I'm done with autogeneration of everything outside source-tree, building libshogun, examples, testsuite...
 sonne|work	so interfaces are missing now right?
 besser82	sonne|work: currently working on getting the modules && modules from pre-build libshogun
 besser82	sonne|work: Yes
 sonne|work	ok cool
 besser82	sonne|work: when all is done I'll rebase, push and PR  ;)
 sonne|work	I know I know
 sonne|work	just keep us updated
 besser82	sonne|work: Sure! I'll do
 besser82	sonne|work: btw. all autogen (but protobuf cpp/h) is now done during configure-stage ;)
 sonne|work	protobuf could be done too
 besser82	sonne|work: could, but is much effort for sth. that could be done quiet easier before builds are done
 besser82	sonne|work: like making all OBJECT-target depend on the pbautogen-target
 sonne|work	maybe it is even good to do it in the build - since it has dependencies...
 sonne|work	so it is not 100% static
 besser82	sonne|work: like making all OBJECT-target depend on the pbautogen-target
 besser82	sonne|work: that's what is intended by `UseProtobuf`  ;)
