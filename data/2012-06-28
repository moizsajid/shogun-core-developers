 heiko	blackburn, around?
 blackburn	yeap
 heiko	hi
 heiko	what you think is the best way to append features from the CFeatures interface side?
 heiko	we talked about that a while ago, but I lsot the overview
 blackburn	append two or more features?
 heiko	two is sufficent
 heiko	and copying is allowed (last time it wasnt)
 blackburn	well
 blackburn	I do not really recall what was our summary
 heiko	how would you do it then?
 blackburn	what do I recall is that we didn't like creating AppendedDotFeatures and so on
 heiko	yes
 heiko	The problem last time was that I wanted to do it in-place
 heiko	but not anymore
 heiko	perhaps just add a method to CFeatures
 heiko	like create_appended_features
 blackburn	hmm and override it
-!- sks_ [~sks@14.97.116.69] has quit [Ping timeout: 240 seconds]
 blackburn	makes sense to me
 heiko	which takes another feature object, and copies own data and given one to a new instance
 heiko	how many feature classes would have to implement that?
 heiko	if I add an abstract method to CFetaures?
 blackburn	well all
 heiko	how many are that?
 heiko	dense,sparse,string
 blackburn	dense, sparse, string
 heiko	streaming?
 blackburn	????
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	:D
 heiko	kk
 heiko	well Ill do that
 heiko	Ill add
 blackburn	I love wrong layout
 heiko	CFeatures* create_merged_copy(CFeatures* other)=0;
 heiko	hehe :)
 blackburn	hmm no need to do it pure I think
 blackburn	rather do it SG_NOTIMPLEMENTED
 heiko	ok
 heiko	I know that Ill be lazy then :)
 blackburn	I expect you add impl only to dense
 heiko	hehe :D

 puffin444	hi blackburn
 blackburn	could you please fix warnings in ExactInferenceMethod? http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/974/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%284%29
 blackburn	I didn't do that to not cause you any troubles with rebasing
 puffin444	Will do
 blackburn	thanks
 CIA-18	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * rd1ee078 / (14 files in 4 dirs): Merge pull request #608 from karlnapf/master (+10 more commits...) - http://git.io/sjloFg
 heiko	blackburn, sonney2k, I might have asked that before, but why do we use this unintuitive gaussian kernel parametrisation?
 heiko	I always forget about that and assume its exp(-0.5||x-y||^2 /sigma^2)
 heiko	which is the standard in most literature i know
@sonney2k	heiko, because it saves the -0.5 * and sigma**2
 heiko	I see, makes sense, does this make such a speed difference?
 heiko	pepole should be warned about it :)
@sonney2k	no, but anyways too late to change
@sonney2k	||x-y|| is the costly part
@sonney2k	if dim(x) > a handful
@sonney2k	heiko, btw what did you want to ask about your feature merging/appending?
 heiko	I was trying to remember what we agreed upon when we talked about that
 heiko	sonney2k, I added virtual CFeatures* create_merged_copy(CFeatures* other)
 heiko	which is overloaded in subclasses of CFeatures
 heiko	and I use that for "merging" (which is not really merging but rather copying, but thats ok)
@sonney2k	I forgot what exactly you wanted to do
@sonney2k	didn't you need some pairs of features or so?
 heiko	sonney2k, originally I wanted to append features in-place
@sonney2k	I forgot why CombinedFeatures won't work for you
@sonney2k	heiko, what for?
@sonney2k	for what :D
 heiko	There was something why that didnt work :)
 heiko	oh, for the two-sample tests
 heiko	Wanted to make it possible to give two objects to the class
 heiko	But operations are much easier if there is only on internally
 heiko	So we agreed upon adding a convienience method
 heiko	which copies two objects together to one
 heiko	and I was wonderung what the best way was
 heiko	I think agreed with the way I did now, but wasnt sure
 heiko	anyway - already implemented and working
 heiko	sonney2k, I have to leave now, will be back later this evening
@sonney2k	heiko, so combinedfeatures would work - but only when you do some extra effort
 heiko	this new method is easiest I think
@sonney2k	..doing computations for each of them or so
@sonney2k	so now you append with copy
@sonney2k	btw we have some method for that at least for dense or sparse or string feuatres
 heiko	I need a CFeatures interface thats why combined did not work, it doesnt see them as one object
 heiko	really?
 heiko	whats the name of it?
@sonney2k	append_features
@sonney2k	in StringFeatures.h
@sonney2k	btw for sparse / string this operation is cheap
 heiko	I know
@sonney2k	for Dense with matrix it is not
 heiko	well there is copy_subset
 heiko	but it copies vector wise
 heiko	mmh
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw what happened to your openmp attempts and eigen?
@sonney2k	eigen3 that is
 heiko	sonney2k, blackburn, see you later!
@sonney2k	heiko, cu

 blackburn	sonney2k: openmp is postponed
 blackburn	eigen3 is to go in next few days
 blackburn	I'd like to get GMM back
@sonney2k	blackburn, yes please do it :D
 blackburn	I feel unfair to alesis dropping whole project of him
 blackburn	it looks I would have to use these pheew dynarray etc stuff
@sonney2k	well in principle dynamic object array is the way to go

 puffin444	@sonney2k, the buildbot can dance?!
@sonney2k	puffin444, only if germany beats italy tonight :D
 puffin444	Okay lol.
@sonney2k	puffin444, btw are these yours' http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/libshogun/builds/0/steps/compile/logs/warnings%20%282%29
 puffin444	Yes I am fixing them. I hope to submit a pull request with scaling that will include the fix.
@sonney2k	ok
 puffin444	I almost ready to submit the request.
@sonney2k	I am just reconfiguring the buildbot so I noticed...
 blackburn	football time!

 gsomix	good evening
@sonney2k	very good
@sonney2k	a goal in the beginning
@sonney2k	no 0:0 crap
 blackburn	haha very good for you
@sonney2k	if not I have to disable the buildbot's dance command
@sonney2k	maybe replace it with cry mode :P
@sonney2k	blackburn, this game really is much better than the one from yesterday
 blackburn	heh probably
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	sonney2k: I am sorry :D
@sonney2k	what?
 blackburn	2-0
@sonney2k	this guy is a weapon
@sonney2k	look at him
 blackburn	ballotelli?
 blackburn	very fast
 blackburn	very precise
-!- alexlovesdata [55b21f1e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.178.31.30] has joined #shogun

@sonney2k	blackburn, yeah but the shot was so strong that he could only lift it only a bit and it hit the bar
@sonney2k	the weapon is gone
 blackburn	yeah no more goals from italy
 blackburn	oops
 blackburn	hahahah
 blackburn	hahaah
 blackburn	silly
@sonney2k	though I don't expect any from germany
@sonney2k	a |x-y| > 1 goal difference makes the game boring again...
 blackburn	sonney2k: I'd say football is usually boring - ice hockey is not :)
@sonney2k	let me guess
@sonney2k	russia is usually winning?
@sonney2k	icehockey I mean
 blackburn	no, I mean rather NHL
 blackburn	my fav club is not of winner kind (colorado avalanche)
 blackburn	argh
 blackburn	they just do not want to play already
@sonney2k	2d soccer is much more exciting than 3d
@sonney2k	often it seems as if this shot will hit the goal
@sonney2k	even though it is miles away
-!- alexlovesdata [55b21f1e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.178.31.30] has joined #shogun
 blackburn	2d?
@sonney2k	blackburn, isn't your TV 2d?
 blackburn	what is 3d?
@sonney2k	mine is
 blackburn	like when you play it?
@sonney2k	real life?
@sonney2k	yeaj
 blackburn	ahh
@sonney2k	h
@sonney2k	so this dim reduction is not lossless
 blackburn	no 2d is less exciting than 3d for me :)
 blackburn	a lot of fun kicking ball
@sonney2k	so its spain : italy
@sonney2k	as expected
 blackburn	soo?
 blackburn	a little more interesting now
@sonney2k	well 2:1 is deserved
 blackburn	may be two goals in two minutes?
@sonney2k	but who cares
 blackburn	I'd like to see
 blackburn	haha running to center
@sonney2k	why is it not over yet?
 blackburn	+4 mins
 blackburn	they have one chancemore
 blackburn	may be one more
 blackburn	argh no way
 blackburn	it is over
 blackburn	not that bad to see something interested in the very end :D
 blackburn	however I consider this strange to play only in additional time :D
@sonney2k	no more pizza ;-)
 blackburn	fiat is not a car and spaghetti is not a food :D
@sonney2k	I have to switch to flammkuchen
 blackburn	Flammkuchen (Alemannisch Flammekueche oder Flammwaie; Els?ssisch Flammekueche; Franz?sisch tarte flamb?e, ,,flambierter Kuchen") ist eine Spezialit?t aus dem Elsass, der benachbarten Pfalz und Baden.
 blackburn	I got three words here
 blackburn	ist, eine and und
 blackburn	:D
 blackburn	ok testing compilation on ssd
 alexlovesdata	as I said to wiking already: the team with the more beautiful female supporters did win :D
 blackburn	hmm
 blackburn	you remind me
 blackburn	so what is with PR?
