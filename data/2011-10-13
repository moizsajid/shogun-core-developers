 blackburn	sonney2k: I've got an idea of very fun task for next gsoc or just to one of us
 blackburn	there could be some task to store visualization information to make easier to visualize something
@sonney2k	visualization information?
 blackburn	yeah something related to training process we could plot
 blackburn	sonney2k: I've got a problem with new 'converter' folder, parallel and io are not visible for some reason
 blackburn	any ideas?
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	sad
@sonney2k	blackburn, did you derive from SGObject?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, I guess the problem is I forgot to implement get_name
 blackburn	sonney2k: where should I add new modular .i files?
@sonney2k	in modular/
 blackburn	sonney2k: no, modshogun.i, somewhere else?
@sonney2k	?
 blackburn	nevermind
 blackburn	fixed
 blackburn	sonney2k: where did you declared python modules for workaround like shogun.Preprocessor, shogun.Classifier?
@sonney2k	blackburn, that is in Makefile.template
 blackburn	thanks
@sonney2k	blackburn, we have to get memory requirements for compiling the interfaces below 1.5 G
@sonney2k	better ~1G
 blackburn	oh
 blackburn	why?
@sonney2k	none of the debs built

 blackburn	sonney2k: have you asked anyone from swig team how to reduce size?
@sonney2k	no
 blackburn	may be they have some tricks for that
@sonney2k	I don't think so...

 blackburn	sonney2k: around?
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r74bf297 / src/shogun/kernel/WeightedDegreePositionStringKernel.cpp : fix lhs / rhs mixup in free_feature_vector (how did this ever work?!) - http://git.io/QCICng
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * ra6e49bb / src/shogun/classifier/svm/WDSVMOcas.h : fix broken free_feature_vector call in wdsvmocas - http://git.io/Q9nfcQ
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r12a5173 / (2 files): introduce more efficient cleanup_feature_vectors function - http://git.io/Nx_h0g
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r18a93b9 / src/shogun/features/DotFeatures.cpp : always set dot feature property on init - http://git.io/ieu_ow
 CIA-3	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg  * r6356f26 / (3 files): fix static octave examples - http://git.io/OJKEJQ
@sonney2k	yes
@sonney2k	blackburn, busy watching http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=pmw87w7i6rQ though
 blackburn	sonney2k: I need an idea how to stole feature matrix from simple features
 blackburn	safely
@sonney2k	I don't think it is currently possible
 blackburn	sonney2k: I would add leave_feature_matrix(), ok?
@sonney2k	what exactly should this do?
@sonney2k	get the ptr of the fm?
 blackburn	sonney2k: yes, and make it not deleted when features will be
@sonney2k	and then replace the fm ptr with yours?
 blackburn	no
 blackburn	I just want features to lose this pointer
 blackburn	and when it is going to be deleted features won't free this matrix
 blackburn	cause it will be used by another features
 blackburn	I could do this with copying but it is pretty bad way in case of large-scale applications
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	so add a function that gets you the ptr and size
@sonney2k	and internally drops/resets preprocs/ptr/sizes
@sonney2k	SGMatrix<ST> get_feature_matrix_and_clear() ?
@sonney2k	or *_and_reset() ?
 blackburn	why not leave_feature_matrix()?
@sonney2k	leave doesn't tell anything about that you steal it
@sonney2k	well how about steal_feature_matrix()
 blackburn	yeah
 blackburn	sonney2k: I have almost done ->converters things
@sonney2k	blackburn, very good
 blackburn	and already moved all the examples
 blackburn	and tested
@sonney2k	I think I fixed all octave examples now that octave runs again under debian unstable
 blackburn	final step - dimensionreductionpreprocessors proxy
 shogun-buildbot	build #281 of python_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/python_static/builds/281
@sonney2k	I have high hopes taht the buildbot goes through now
@sonney2k	ha :)
 blackburn	sonney2k: we are doing nice progress last 1.5 months :)
 blackburn	I'm running out of power with improving my dim reduction 'toolkit' though
@sonney2k	one of the most important things is to keep git master compilable/ tests running
 blackburn	I would be very disappointed being rejected with paper
@sonney2k	and the debian package
@sonney2k	blackburn, dont' expect that the paper will be accepted immediately
 blackburn	sonney2k: month?
@sonney2k	there will be at least one revision
@sonney2k	months + that
 blackburn	ah
 blackburn	I see
 blackburn	well at least after programming I can focus on paper
 blackburn	I feel much happier with converters concept
 blackburn	without any changes you can now embed features that doesn't fit in memory
 blackburn	sonney2k: are kernels support this?
 shogun-buildbot	build #288 of octave_static is complete: Success [build successful]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/octave_static/builds/288
@sonney2k	strike :)
 blackburn	nice
@sonney2k	I don't understand what you are saying...
 blackburn	sonney2k: can I init kernel with FileFeatures or so?
@sonney2k	simplefeatures don't have to be in memory...
@sonney2k	so partially yes
 blackburn	I mean that most of methods are now working with any Features supporting distance/kernel
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw the only way I see to get compilation below 1.5GB is to remove a few %template's
@sonney2k	so I guess I should make them configurable
@sonney2k	and drop as much as possible...
@sonney2k	I see. but don't you need access to the full kernel/distance matrix?
@sonney2k	or do you only access element pairs?
 blackburn	unfortunately I need
@sonney2k	well then you shouldn't care if features fit in memory
@sonney2k	these will not be the bottleneck :)
 blackburn	before it wasn't any possible
 blackburn	cause it was working only with SimpleFeatures
@sonney2k	the buildbot is now working on the modular interfaces again
@sonney2k	finally...
@sonney2k	blackburn, I see
