 eric	hi
-!- eric is now known as Guest28610
 Guest28610	hi again
 blackburn	hi
 Guest28610	My problem with python-numpy support is solved
 Guest28610	It was a problem with libatlas-3gf
 blackburn	I see
 Guest28610	I have run another isntall on another machine to be sure, showing "import numpy" from python console before installing each part of libatlas
 blackburn	so, did you manage to install shogun?
 blackburn	hah
 Guest28610	yes it's perfect now
 blackburn	strange you met this kind of error
 Guest28610	indeed
 Guest28610	I have also written a cmakelists.txt to work with shogun in c++ project
 Guest28610	lots of link to external libs is required
 Guest28610	I would like now to ask you for advice: working in a big c++ project, I would like to draw some outputs like in python modular interface, using matplotlib
 Guest28610	Do you know if that's possible ?
 blackburn	well you can output your data to some file or so
 blackburn	and then plot using mpl
 Guest28610	sure but, I do realtime processing on video stream
 blackburn	hmm then matplotlib is not a good choice
 Guest28610	to difficult to run python code from c++ ?
 blackburn	it would be pretty slow I think
 Guest28610	any idea then ?
 blackburn	well if you do any video processing check opencv
 Guest28610	I use it already
 Guest28610	c++ vxl too
 blackburn	hmm what exactly you need to draw?
 Guest28610	I tried to use shogun to fuse features using mkl and do classification task in realtime accumulating features
 blackburn	I see
 Guest28610	would like to draw the distribution
 blackburn	ah I thought you want to draw images with matplotlib
 Guest28610	I use opengl for that
 Guest28610	are you a developper of shogun btw ?
 blackburn	well I believe it is possible to clue C++ and matplotlib but no idea how
 blackburn	ye
 blackburn	s
 Guest28610	allright then
 Guest28610	if you got any idea about this I stay on the chat for the day, beginning to dig into shogun code
