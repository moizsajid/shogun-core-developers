@sukey	New Comment on Issue #3513 by sudk1896: "@karlnapf : Seems like the perfect task for me. I will do this. I saw the kNN notebook in the docs. In it, it only does a speed comparison between `KNN_BRUTE` and `KNN_COVER_TREE`. I am assuming you also want me to add a speed comparison between `KNN_KDTREE` and the rest ? Is that what is required here ?
@sukey	Also, when you meant the kNN notebook that would be the IPython notebook [here](http://shogun-toolbox.org/notebook/latest/KNN.html) right ?
@sukey	Thanks." - https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/issues/3513#issuecomment-258764040

@sukey	New Comment on Pull Request "Was the casting necessary? Just wondering, does the `+=` operator (in the `map_result.col(row)wise() += casted_l(r)hs_norms` expression) take care of the case when the operands are of different type? If it can, then we don't need that. Can you please double check?" by lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3427#discussion_r86723079
@sukey	New Comment on Pull Request "I think you can have the `map_result` as `double` valued matrix from the beginning (take the matrix that you'll return in the end in the beginning itself, and then use the map as lvalue). So, if the `lhs` and `rhs` vectors are `float32_t` valued, you'll have just one cast (in this above expression). You won't need to cast the norm vectors.
@sukey	In the present code, in addition to casting the map result, we're having to cast the vectors (== mem-alloc/copy for those entire vectors) as well. Also, in the end, we're having to copy all the values back.
@sukey	What do you think?" by lambday: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3427#discussion_r86723688

@sukey	it would be really cool to have meta examples for this stuff. Really simple to turn your code above into that.
