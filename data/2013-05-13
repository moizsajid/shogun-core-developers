@sonney2k	lisitsyn, all integration test data needs to be regenerated
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: again?
@sonney2k	if you are still awake please do it ... run generator.py and commit
@sonney2k	yeah
@sonney2k	preprocessor is now a Dyn*array
@sonney2k	not longer a **
@sonney2k	so reading serialized files failes now
@lisitsyn	sonney2k: but why that affected data
@lisitsyn	ahh
@sonney2k	for *all* features
@lisitsyn	got it

 pickle27	hey is anyone on here right now?
 van51	pickle27: I am :p
 pickle27	van51: cool, I wanted to ask somebody a question
 van51	pickle27: shoot then and I hope I can help
 pickle27	van51: so I've finished my eigen3 version of MCLDA and I want to get some feedback, is a pull request the preferred way to do this? Its what I did last time but thought I'd ask this time
 pickle27	van51: basically I am planning to do more work on it so I don't want it merge yet
 pickle27	van51: thoughts?
 van51	pickle27: I am not sure if it is the preferred way, but I 've seen that if you reference the issue you are working on in your commit message and push in your repository, like #1061, then it makes a post under that issue with a link to your push
 van51	and it shows the commit with the diff
 pickle27	van51: interesting
 van51	so maybe they can comment there instead on a PR
 van51	of*
 van51	but that is just an alternative that I can think of.. not sure if it is the best way to go :p

 sonne|work	iglesiasg, HeikoS: could you please run ./tester evaluation_multiclassovrevaluation_modular.py on your machine (with up-to-date shogun!)
 sonne|work	I dont' understand the build error
 sonne|work	test error

 sonne|work	too
@lisitsyn	hey there
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: hey
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: http://shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/nightly_default/builds/393/steps/test/logs/stdio
 sonne|work	have you seen this build failure?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: not yet
 sonne|work	it seems HeikoS can reproduce it on his machine  http://pastebin.com/cATb3Vv9
@lisitsyn	okay some deviation here
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: but I couldn't
 sonne|work	big deviation yes
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: I am unable to check that on my machine now unfortunately
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: but you ran generator.py last night right?
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: yes
 sonne|work	so you don't have it then
@lisitsyn	if it is not floating random
@lisitsyn	oh! go wings go
 sonne|work	1e-3 is not
@lisitsyn	ducks were beaten hurray
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: why not
 sonne|work	how?
 sonne|work	this test did work before
 sonne|work	after wiking rand change we have this now
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: no idea just guess
@lisitsyn	everything is so complex I don't exclude any reason
 sonne|work	HeikoS: could you please add predicted_labels and svm to be returned in ../examples/undocumented/python_modular/evaluation_multiclassovrevaluation_modular.py ?
 sonne|work	then run generator.py and push upload everything
 sonne|work	lisitsyn: well it could be if numerics is different then we get a different solution up to svm eps precision
@lisitsyn	sonne|work: but that's some accuracy or so, right?
@lisitsyn	I think they differ by one incorrect answer or so
@iglesiasg	I am getting this warning everywhere after updating to latest Shogun

@wiking	mmm travis is still dying :(
@wiking	mmm interesting.... only 1 of that is crashing on buildbot
 van51	I thought that SG_UNREF(k) would set k to null after it's done
 van51	and with the list way after the get_next_element() on the last element,  k was set to null, and so after that there were tests of the form k==null
@lisitsyn	van51: in general no
 van51	but with the new array way, k was never set to null after the last element
 van51	and so the next conditions failed

@lisitsyn	pickle27: evince?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah thats probably what I was going to use
 pickle27	lisitsyn: thought I'd see if anyone had any suggestions
@lisitsyn	pickle27: from the left
@lisitsyn	there is 'thumbnails' thing
@lisitsyn	select annotations here
@lisitsyn	then you can put some annotations all around the pdf
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay thanks
@sonney2k	pickle27, yeah that will be interesting to see how much eigen3 is slower
@lisitsyn	eigen3 is slower?
@lisitsyn	where on what?

 pickle27	lisitsyn: multiclass LDA
@lisitsyn	pickle27: comparing to blas?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: we haven't tested yet but our belief is that it will be slower
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah
@lisitsyn	belief??
 pickle27	lisitsyn: the svd in particular
 pickle27	lisitsyn: theory
@lisitsyn	pickle27: what theory? different methods?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: the theory is that blas will be faster than eigen3
@lisitsyn	pickle27: funny :)
@lisitsyn	any reason?
 pickle27	lisitsyn: we'll see it'll be interesting
@lisitsyn	pickle27: it depends what blas impl you use
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah
@lisitsyn	pickle27: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark and there are benchmarks
 pickle27	lisitsyn: interesting
 pickle27	lisitsyn: I'm still planning to test both my mclda versions for kicks
@lisitsyn	pickle27: yeah I just mean the benchmark might not be really fair
 pickle27	lisitsyn: very true
@lisitsyn	pickle27: you are heavily using eigen map
@lisitsyn	it may cause some limitations
 pickle27	lisitsyn: yeah - also thats my only real option right?
@lisitsyn	I am not very sure but alignment matters
@lisitsyn	pickle27: I didn't check very thorougly
 pickle27	lisitsyn: okay
@lisitsyn	but it may cause something bad
@lisitsyn	performance wise
@lisitsyn	pickle27: but better check first :)
 pickle27	lisitsyn: but if I want to return SGMatrix then eigen map is my only choice right
@lisitsyn	yes sure

@sonney2k	HeikoS, ping ping?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: hi
@sonney2k	HeikoS, I was trying to convert the tests to use your equals but all fail
@HeikoS	okay
@HeikoS	so do you have en example?
@HeikoS	probably still contains some bugs that I need to take care of
@HeikoS	but I tested it on a few more complex examples and always worked
@HeikoS	sonney2k: so would be good to reproduce the example in c++
@sonney2k	./tester.py kernel_gaussian_modular.py
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] entering DynamicObjectArray::equals()
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] comparing parameter 0
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] comparing parameter "array" to other's "array"
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] comparing parameter 1
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] comparing parameter "num_elements" to other's "num_elements"
@sonney2k	[DEBUG] leaving DynamicObjectArray::equals(): parameters at position 1 with name "num_elements" differs from other object parameter with name "num_elements"
@HeikoS	sonney2k
@HeikoS	so first problem:
@sonney2k	HeikoS, can one somehow print the values?
@HeikoS	there are many more debug messages
@HeikoS	which print the values
@HeikoS	however, they are not printed for some reason
@HeikoS	I dont know why
@sonney2k	how to enable them?
@HeikoS	sonney2k: its a bug
@sonney2k	HeikoS, well give me an example
@HeikoS	remember I told you a couple of times that some debug messages dont appear
@sonney2k	never heard of any issues
@sonney2k	no
@sonney2k	I fixed that last time
@HeikoS	so this particular example of yours enters the TParameter::compare_ptype method
@HeikoS	and also the TParmaeter::compare_stype

 shogun-notifier-	shogun: some NULL checks for equals method
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ok, this seems to be something else
@sonney2k	HeikoS, ohh maybe this could even be different...
@HeikoS	I just fixed the NULL things
@sonney2k	subtle case!
@HeikoS	this seems to have to do with DynamicObject array
@HeikoS	but i had this error before actually
@HeikoS	forgot what caused it
@sonney2k	I have save_serializable_pre
@sonney2k	etc functions in there
@sonney2k	to not store more than necessary
@sonney2k	The dynamic object array is growing with chunks of size 128 IIRC
@HeikoS	yes
@HeikoS	this might not be saved
@sonney2k	so I am trying to avoid saving 128 NULL objects
@HeikoS	I see
@sonney2k	if the array in fact has 0 size
@sonney2k	so what now?
@HeikoS	ignore-list?
@sonney2k	call save_serializable_pre?
@sonney2k	IDK
@HeikoS	dont know
@HeikoS	I gotta go now anyway, I will think about it
@HeikoS	these are marginal cases though
@HeikoS	the general equals works
@sonney2k	I think that is the only case...
@HeikoS	very nice to have the parameter framework
@HeikoS	btw
@HeikoS	makes things easy
@HeikoS	the offset in the sparse vectors costed me some nerves though, we should document that properly
@HeikoS	anyway, gotta go, have a nice evening!
@sonney2k	yeah only dyn* arrays have this
@sonney2k	HeikoS, cu!

@sonney2k	van51, this is a monster patch
@sonney2k	van51, it is basically impossible to test if everything is OK
 van51	sonney2k: what can we do then?
@sonney2k	van51, all we can do is unit tests
@sonney2k	van51, it will also unfortunately break all our combinedkernel/features related integration tests
@sonney2k	really stupid
@sonney2k	I don't know a way around this
@sonney2k	let me check if our old tests covered combined*
 van51	sonney2k: well, what needs to be done
@sonney2k	yes we have one test for combined
@sonney2k	van51, is that a Q?
 van51	sonney2k: no I meant that what needs to be done will be done, even if it's tedious
 van51	but now that you mention it, it is also a question :p
 van51	because I'm going to need some guidance for sure
@sonney2k	van51, the big problem I see is that this patch might introduce a bug in MKL & svmlight etc
@sonney2k	but I have no idea how to easily test this
@sonney2k	ohh wait maybe I have
 van51	:)
@sonney2k	lets take one very complex example
@sonney2k	then save the output it produces
@sonney2k	and compare again
 van51	aah
 van51	sounds good
@sonney2k	if that matches all good
@sonney2k	then run this with valgrind again
@sonney2k	no memory leaks / uninited memory -> ready to merge
@sonney2k	let me see what would work
@sonney2k	van51, which $LANG can you compile on your machine?
@sonney2k	van51, if you could install octave
 van51	sonney2k: I can do octave, I have it already
@sonney2k	there are 2 examples mkl_classify_christmas_star.m mkl_regression_3sine_waves.m
@sonney2k	we should modify them a bit to store the actuall classifier outputs
@sonney2k	but then if they still work fine we are good for sure
@sonney2k	they heavily use the combinedfeatures/kernels
@sonney2k	van51, actually just run mkl_classify_christmas_star
@sonney2k	it will give you a varilable 'result'
@sonney2k	result.trainout and result.testout
@sonney2k	these are matrices with all outputs for various experiments
@sonney2k	if these match with your changes we are fine
 van51	sonney2k: ok
 van51	sonney2k: first I have to compile the octave interface right?
@sonney2k	with a one-liner we can add the same to the regression example
@sonney2k	van51, just install liboctave-dev
@sonney2k	then do ./configure --interfaces=octave_static --disable-optimization
@sonney2k	(the latter only to save some compile time)
 van51	sonney2k: Ok, I am compiling
 van51	sonney2k: but on my edited code..
@sonney2k	van51, well you can just save the output in octave with
@sonney2k	save somefile results
@sonney2k	but if it even works it is good
@sonney2k	I will give some minor feedback in the meantime
 van51	sonney2k: cool
 van51	I'll let you know
@sonney2k	van51, what strikes me is that we have no more thread safety issues traversing the array... all just index lookups
@sonney2k	very useful
 van51	sonney2k: yea, that was my intention all along :p
 van51	sonney2k: btw does that example take a long time or could it be stuck or something?
@sonney2k	van51, if you did compile with --disable-optimization it might take a while
@sonney2k	but it should be rather quick
@sonney2k	let me compile the interface
 van51	ok it finished
 van51	sonney2k: it showed two warnings
@sonney2k	it took maybe 10 seconds here
@sonney2k	van51, please do
@sonney2k	pcolor(w)
@sonney2k	colorbar
 van51	it says can't plot with an empty cb range
 van51	and can't plot with an empty y range
@sonney2k	van51, then please
@sonney2k	type w
@sonney2k	w
@sonney2k	and copy the output somewhere
 van51	everything is 0.2
@sonney2k	dpaste.com or so
@sonney2k	errm
@sonney2k	not good
 van51	thought so
@sonney2k	van51, ok let me compile your version
@sonney2k	maybe you have some other libs installed or so
@sonney2k	van51, if that doesn't help - you should write a unit test that checks the combined kernel
 van51	sonney2k: Ok, I will
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: dropping swig?
 van51	sonney2k: I'm sorry but I have to go for a while now
@sonney2k	van51, wrt your patch - it is syntax wise all fine now
 van51	wrt?
@sonney2k	there is no obvious error in that and since it is 1000 loc or so I certainly won't spot the 1 potential line with a mistake
@sonney2k	w.r.t.
 van51	w.r.t.? :p
 lisitsyn	with respect to
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, well think of we could generate interfaces
 van51	aah, thanks
@sonney2k	and use the paramter framework to pass around stuff
@sonney2k	I mean *lean* interfaces
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I don't really get it
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: something more stupid
 lisitsyn	for me
 lisitsyn	:)
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: so do not use swig at all?
@sonney2k	van51, ok it takes ages
@sonney2k	so sth is wrong
 van51	sonney2k: ok
 van51	i'll be back in 2 or 3 hours
 van51	I'll start looking at it again then
@sonney2k	then I am hopefully asleep
@sonney2k	drug time
 van51	ok, i'll bug you again tomorrow then :p
@sonney2k	van51, but please try to get closer to the root cause
 van51	sonney2k: I will :)
 van51	sorry but I g2g for now
@sonney2k	van51, cu
 van51	bye
@sonney2k	and thanks!
