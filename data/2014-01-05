@HeikoS	lisitsyn: hi!
@HeikoS	besser82: hi! :)
@HeikoS	all hi!
 lambday	HeikoS: hey :)
@HeikoS	lambday: ah, good to catch you!
 lambday	HeikoS: happy new year! :)
@HeikoS	how are things?
@HeikoS	happy new year to you too :)
 lambday	HeikoS: pretty good! how's your exams?
@HeikoS	lambday: ah, I should study more, but I am quite distracted
@HeikoS	few more days until the first one
 lambday	HeikoS: no worries! couple of all nighters would do! :)
@HeikoS	haha
@HeikoS	no, for me this doesnt really work
@HeikoS	anyways
@HeikoS	how are things for you?
 lambday	HeikoS: still not out of holiday mode.. back to bombay though
@sonney2k	HeikoS, so 3.1 is out now - we just need some announcement email...
 lambday	sonney2k: wow! that's awesome
@HeikoS	lambday: ah its good that you relax a bit!
@HeikoS	sonney2k: ah nice!
@HeikoS	cool, let me check the news
@HeikoS	sonney2k: nice work! :)
@HeikoS	lambday: so what are you interested in most to work on next?
 lambday	HeikoS: computing interface would be cool
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah totally
 lambday	but I am pretty much up for anything
@HeikoS	lambday: what about doing something for multicore independent computations
@HeikoS	if we had a prototype running, we could go from there
@HeikoS	maybe computation of a kernel matrix or so
@HeikoS	lambday: so I would first try to make a simple example work under this interface
@HeikoS	and then try to make it as easy as possible to use
@HeikoS	and then extend it to some other multicore parallel things in shogun
@HeikoS	and maybe start working on a batch cluster backend also
@HeikoS	but thats a bit harder
 lambday	HeikoS: alright! so adding one extension to the independent computation engine.. pthread/openmp?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah, but first think about parallel shared memory stuff a bit
@HeikoS	for example in the matrix case, we dont want to copy the features
@HeikoS	so there needs to be a way of sharing objects in the framework
@HeikoS	lambday: but maybe everything could just be shared --- since for distributed stuff, everything needs to be serialised anyways
 lambday	alright
@HeikoS	I think it would be good to start this via thinking about code that computes the kernel matrix in parallel
@HeikoS	have a look at the current code for that
@HeikoS	CKernel I think
@HeikoS	(horrible - non-readable)
 lambday	hehe.. checking!
@HeikoS	lambday: and in fact, the parallel framework could maybe be moved to a separate project/module that works independent of shogun
@HeikoS	lambday: because other people might be interested in that
@HeikoS	without being interested in shogun
@HeikoS	but maybe thats later
 lisitsyn	guys please be wise to use pools ;)
 lambday	HeikoS: like lisitsyn's tapkee?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah
 lambday	HeikoS: awesome!
 lambday	lisitsyn: pools?
 lisitsyn	yes thread pools
 lambday	alright
 lisitsyn	lambday: so each computation task is just commited to a thread pool
 lisitsyn	and if there are any threads they start doing it
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: pools?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: take a look at ExecutorService in java
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah thats the idea, although I would call it queue
 lisitsyn	no it is called thread pool if we speak about threads being managed this way ;)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: java's fork join stuff is a great thing to steal things from
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: yeah probably
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday but thats in fact implementation detail
@HeikoS	first step is to make the interface work
@HeikoS	and for that, a very simple queue is enough
@HeikoS	once that works, one can think about the scheduling a bit more
 lambday	HeikoS: yeah..
 lambday	HeikoS: for the kernel thing, you meant CKernel::get_kernel_matrix(), right?
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah this pthread constructions
@HeikoS	lambday: its actually pretty simple in its structure
@HeikoS	but hard to read
@HeikoS	if this was something with jobs that are submitted, I would like that more
 lambday	HeikoS: alright.. yeah..
 lambday	this is exactly similar to what we had for sgsparsematrix-sgvector product pthreaded
@HeikoS	lambday: and it would be great if we could condense a few general prupose jobs, so that one doesnt have to implement a new class every time
@HeikoS	but maybe just pass a function pointer to the job or so
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah a bit, but for the parallel structure, just use the most simple way for now
@HeikoS	so just [1,2,3,4][5,6,7,8][9,10,11,12] in turns
 lambday	okay
 lambday	general purpose job is tough... callback thing is better
@HeikoS	lambday: yeah true
@HeikoS	lambday: maybe for now, define a new class, we can simplify later
@HeikoS	this is all about proof of concept and learning about caveats
 lambday	alright...
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  just checking out vim and ctags, thats nice
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what do use again for editing?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: clang_complete + vim
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: how do you browse between classes in that?
@HeikoS	and how to set up clang_complete?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: Ctrl + ] :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: are you using any vim package manager?
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: I dont know what that is
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just a few minutes
@HeikoS	lisitsyn, lambday gotta catch my place now, see you later
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: urgh okay
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: just got back :)
@HeikoS	lisitsyn: maybe few more mins
@HeikoS	so I just installed clang_complete
@HeikoS	and added it to the vimrc
@HeikoS	and now?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: no no don't do that
@HeikoS	lisitsyn:  ok tell me :)
@HeikoS	delete .vimrc again?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: what's in your vimrc?

@HeikoS	Consider setting g:clang_library_pat
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: well I'd expect once installed it should be available
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: is libclang-dev installed too?
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	but weird package names -...
@HeikoS	I got libclang-dev installed
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: can you find where libclang.so is?
@HeikoS	but there is also libclang-3.3-dev
@HeikoS	which is not installed
 lisitsyn	find /usr | grep libclang.so
 lisitsyn	do you have any?
@HeikoS	yeah  but weird
 lisitsyn	what's weird?

 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: hmmm I have /usr/lib/libclang.so
 HeikoS1	yeah just got very fast network
 HeikoS1	ok installed another package
 HeikoS1	mine are all under /usr/lib/llvm
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: 13.10?
 HeikoS1	yeah
 HeikoS1	maybe ill just link that?
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: well you can put that path to g:clang_library_path
 HeikoS1	I just linked it for now
 HeikoS1	doesnt complain when starting now
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: hmm okay :)
 HeikoS1	how to use it :)
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: try ctrl + ] on the name of any class
 lisitsyn	any jump happens?
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: nope
 HeikoS1	lisitsyn: it did before when I used ctags
 HeikoS1	but deleted that tag file
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: no, ctags needs index
 lisitsyn	libclang just uses actual cpps
 HeikoS1	ah something works
 HeikoS1	it complains about swap files
 lisitsyn	HeikoS1: try writing some x->
 lisitsyn	in some method
 lisitsyn	it should suggest you available methods
 lisitsyn	any luck here?
 HeikoS1	ah yeah
 HeikoS1	that works
 lisitsyn	but not jumps?

@HeikoS	lisitsyn: what are the main features you use?
@HeikoS	ah there they are on top
 lisitsyn	HeikoS: hmm does it show a select
@HeikoS	how to exit this view
 lisitsyn	that lists available methods?
@HeikoS	I got this method on top of my vim window now
@HeikoS	[scratch] [preview]
 lisitsyn	ahh
 lisitsyn	it would be closed if you select some method and [enter]
@HeikoS	I did
 lisitsyn	ah
 lisitsyn	probably one option of these I pasted
 lisitsyn	does that
 lisitsyn	some auto_close
@HeikoS	ah

 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I am afraid I won't be in time
@sonney2k	now 77%?
 lisitsyn	as for complex
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: no still 75%
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: is that the cause?
 lisitsyn	ahh I see
 lisitsyn	what's the gcc?
 lisitsyn	it has no 11 but has 0x?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	then it should do that
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, so now we would need 3.1.1 but not for workgroups already...
@sonney2k	I guess we have to do 3.11 this time!
@sonney2k	I feel much more confident we can do releases quickly now

@sonney2k	lisitsyn, it did work out http://shogun-toolbox.org/new/39/ !
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, all automagic now
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: so you finally automagicized it?
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, yes
 lisitsyn	sounds good
@sonney2k	I am still doing the steps one by one though
@sonney2k	I am too scared of screwing things up
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: I have a prototype for one thing
@sonney2k	lisitsyn, all that is missing is some automagic slogan / number thing (currently a picture...)

 lisitsyn	Vector w;
 lisitsyn	minimize(norm(w));
 lisitsyn	and etc
