@wiking	thoralf: source_group is your friend...
 thoralf	Hey Viktor
 thoralf	wiking: Talking about cmake/eclipse?
@wiking	y
 lisitsyn	sonney2k: Generalized CSV ;)
@wiking	if that's defined in the cmakefiles
@wiking	then you'll have the directory based groupping in eclipse
 lisitsyn	wiking: ooh I guess that holds for VS too?
 lisitsyn	I always wondered why should I find a source file in a long list :D
@wiking	indeed
@wiking	http://health.adelaide.edu.au/psychology/ccs/teaching/lsr/
@wiking	heh
@wiking	sonney2k: around?
 lisitsyn	what's it?
@wiking	lisitsyn: book
 lisitsyn	wiking: oh I thought a giraffe ;)
@wiking	:D
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: WHY U NO CMAKE!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@wiking	?!
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: CMAKE!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
 lisitsyn	shogun-buildbot: can you haz cmakez
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: apt-get install cmake
@wiking	shogun-buildbot: dance!
 shogun-buildbot	What you say!
@wiking	mmm

@wiking	************************
 lisitsyn	wiking: do you understand how -framework in osx works?
 lisitsyn	I want it in linux
@wiking	lisitsyn: heheh no can haz
@wiking	but yeah framework is pretty nice concept
 lisitsyn	wiking: one can haz write a plugin or anything like that
 lisitsyn	wiking: I want such a thing but internet connection oriented
 lisitsyn	just cache things
 lisitsyn	a repo of headers!
@wiking	:D
 lisitsyn	wiking: have you tried scons btw?
@wiking	yep
@wiking	it's ok
 lisitsyn	wiking: I guess it is easier to set up
 lisitsyn	because cmake is like whole world of magnificient commands with mysterious behaviour
@wiking	:P
@wiking	http://9gag.com/gag/aNeKE2b
@wiking	heh
@wiking	nice once
@wiking	*one
 lisitsyn	wiking: do you like blender ui?
 lisitsyn	I want to have it as a library :D
 thoralf	How can I detect if I'm about to kill my heap?
 thoralf	For example: int32_t foo[size];
 thoralf	If size is too big, I should kill myself
 thoralf	But what is too big?
 thoralf	size==2? ;)
 thoralf	Sorry, stack.
 shogun-buildbot	build #1708 of deb1 - libshogun is complete: Failure [failed test]  Build details are at http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/buildbot/builders/deb1%20-%20libshogun/builds/1708  blamelist: Soeren Sonnenburg <sonne@debian.org>
 lisitsyn	thoralf: don't use it ;)
 lisitsyn	well you could obtain stack size somehow
 lisitsyn	thoralf: I haven't found anything to determine the stack size
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Thanks.
* thoralf likes the stack, since it cleans itself. :)

 lisitsyn	thoralf: you've got to keep objects that clean stuff in the stack then!
 lisitsyn	like vector, list, unique_ptr or whatever
 thoralf	lisitsyn: Yes.
 thoralf	lisitsyn: In C I sometimes used VLAs and could rely on cleanup.
 thoralf	(I know that VLAs are not the best idea, but they can be used improving readability etc.)
 lisitsyn	thoralf: never used them :)

@iglesiasg	good evening gentlemen
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, hey there!
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, how is it going?
@iglesiasg	what's up with travis clang that it is not happy
@sonney2k	iglesiasg, admittedly I didn't understand what is wrong
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, according to the travis log, it seems that it just stopped or so. No idea
@iglesiasg	sonney2k, BTW, I've got a doubt. Is it normal that valgrind detects strange errors when compiling with optimizations enabled?
