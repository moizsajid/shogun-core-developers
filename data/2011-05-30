 blackburn	what's up?
 CIA-32	shogun: Soeren Sonnenburg master * r66c3ce3 / (105 files in 9 dirs):
 CIA-32	shogun: rename classify / classify_example to more generic apply() - to be used
 CIA-32	shogun: in all machines. adjust examples accordingly. - http://bit.ly/lt4sl9
@sonney2k	blackburn, that
@sonney2k	blackburn, I did the apply() bite
@sonney2k	blackburn, how did your exams go?
@sonney2k	gtf
 blackburn	sonney2k: passed one, two to go
 blackburn	nice renaming work  :)
 blackburn	you probably got angry while doing so many renamings :D
 blackburn	oh I see you like idea of 'polymorphic' apply()
 blackburn	sonney2k: btw I think I know why my matrices were transposed here in LLE
 blackburn	now fixing
 blackburn	hehe
 blackburn	had some tests for 3d->3d mapping
 blackburn	sonney2k: was http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/3d-initial.png
 blackburn	become http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10139213/share/3d-transformed.png

 blackburn	hey http://mldemos.epfl.ch/ rocks
@sonney2k	blackburn, back
@sonney2k	your idea with polymorphic apply(SGVector x) doesn't work though
 blackburn	sonney2k: why?
@sonney2k	I mean for some machines inputs are not necessarily vectors
@sonney2k	think of kernel machines...
 blackburn	ah I see
@sonney2k	input can be a kernel or strings or ...
@sonney2k	one can add this to special cases though...
 blackburn	I don't know, you know better :)
@sonney2k	congrats on your exam #1
 blackburn	thank you it was easy
 blackburn	two to go next two days
 blackburn	and more serious exams - on 10,16,21
@sonney2k	as long as they are easy - fine :)
@sonney2k	nice pictures
@sonney2k	I hope you send a pull request soon
@sonney2k	blackburn, btw we currently only have apply() nothing more
@sonney2k	lets see how many people start to wine
 blackburn	sonney2k: are we hurry up with algos? I can pull it but it is prepreprebeta indeed
 blackburn	last day I was testing and checking some thing manually with octave :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, no we are not
@sonney2k	I thought you had one ready already :)
 blackburn	ready but I have to check everything
 blackburn	because if it is classification algo - everything is showed up on almost every dataset
 blackburn	there - no 'true' embedding - so I have to test if all the things are doing as is
 blackburn	although it is almost ready because I have tested almost everything :D
@sonney2k	blackburn, if you implement it once in python once in C++ you can be pretty sure that it works
 CIA-32	shogun: Heiko Strathmann master * r9a6a36e / src/libshogun/modelselection/ParameterCombination.cpp : forgot this file. initial working version of parameter specification (+16 more commits...) - http://bit.ly/jW4nqb
@sonney2k	impressive...
@sonney2k	lots of work
