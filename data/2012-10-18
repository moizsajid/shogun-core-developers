 blackburn	how much?
 wiking	i still want to see what mosek does though
 wiking	one loss function for my case: 34.59
 wiking	the published one best case is 35.6
 blackburn	what's the difference between your method and previous?
 wiking	well the underlying so-solver
 blackburn	hmm so just a solver issue?
 wiking	yep
 blackburn	are you using BMRM?
 wiking	p-bmrm
 blackburn	proximal point?
 wiking	p3bmrm for that matter
 wiking	not ppbmrm
 blackburn	aham
 wiking	but the p3bmrm
 wiking	with multiple cps
 blackburn	well you should publish it then :D
 wiking	hehehe
 wiking	i need to get the other benchmarking data set
 wiking	but it not only gives me better results
 wiking	but much less training time is needed as well
 wiking	:P
 wiking	it's like 2/3
 wiking	so pretty good
 blackburn	here comes a title "Efficient latent structured support vector machines training via multiple cutting plane models"
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	::DDD
 wiking	lolface
 blackburn	lets write an abstract :D
 blackburn	Nowadays latent models of visual concept recognition are widespread and efficient. However blablabla
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	nyihahahaha
 wiking	btw freak is already included in opencv 2.4.2
 wiking	afaik we have a timer function in shogun right? ?:)
 blackburn	wiking: CTime right
 blackburn	wiking: yes freak is in for a while already
 blackburn	wiking: I tried it as a dense descriptor
 blackburn	works ok but in the end I started to believe it is just wrong

 wiking	sonne|work: online?
 sonne|work	y
 wiking	sonne|work: can u give me an access to a buildslave where there is clang?
 sonne|work	 that machine is doing all mailinglist, webhosting, buildslave
 sonne|work	so no
 wiking	i will not vandalize it
 sonne|work	but I should have a bit of time once on the mentor summit to do these changes
 wiking	just want to fix the static analyzer
 wiking	it should be a 2liner :)
 wiking	or is there sense to add another buildslave?
-!- blackburn [5bdfb203@gateway/web/freenode/ip.91.223.178.3] has joined #shogun
 wiking	since i have a spare ubuntu server running around
 wiking	so there we could have static analyzer
 blackburn	wiking da servers master
 wiking	sonne|work: maybe that sounds better? and then that would be the static analyzer bot?
 sonne|work	wiking: we don't have an ubuntu buildslave yet
 sonne|work	so it would make sense
 wiking	sonne|work: oh ok
 sonne|work	and yes give me the 2 liner :)
 wiking	sonne|work: i'll do the thingy
 wiking	w8
 wiking	dont go away!
 sonne|work	wiking: I don't have access to the bot from work but can maybe do it form the airport tomorrow
 wiking	sonne|work: buildslave create-slave shogun-buildbot www.shogun-toolbox.org shogun-ubuntu1 <passwd>
 wiking	that sounds good for you?
 sonne|work	probably good - w/o access to the bots I have no clue (brain == empty)
 wiking	sonne|work: okok i've tried to follow what's in the freebsd bot config
 wiking	i've sent you in /msg the details, or should i send it via email?
 sonne|work	ha
 sonne|work	yes
 wiking	i'll run now a test with static analyzer on that host on shogun
 wiking	blackburn: here?
 wiking	blackburn: what packages should i have on ubuntu for a decent shougn build?
 sonne|work	wiking: apt-get build-dep shogun
 sonne|work	and also the newer ones
 wiking	mmm something is weird with atlas/lapack
 wiking	installed libatlas-dev
 wiking	but doesn't recongise it
 blackburn	wiking: libatlas3gf-base
 sonne|work	wiking, well you need arpack, nlopt, superlu, snappy etc too
 wiking	Checking for Atlas support ... no
 sonne|work	wiking: do you want to just build libshogun or the whole thing with octave, java, lua etc...
 wiking	libshogun at first
 sonne|work	k
 blackburn	wiking: install libatlas* :D
 wiking	ok i've done with it
 blackburn	everything that has atlas word :)
 wiking	now it's doing the static-analyzer
 wiking	which package is NLOPT?
 wiking	i couldn't find anything with apt-cache search nlopt
 blackburn	wiking: bingo, it is nonexistent
 blackburn	:D
 wiking	:>
 wiking	i see
 wiking	ok then
 wiking	u install it by hand?
 wiking	brb
 blackburn	yes
 sonne|work	wiking: there is one in debian unstable - so probably newer ubuntus will have it
 wiking	blackburn: yesterday i've tried to do a SGSparseVector -> Eigen::SparseVector mapping but it seems it's more complicated than i thought... i.e. it would take an awful lot of copy elements... and i think this way we'd loose the performance gain of eigen
 wiking	sonne|work: noup :( i have 12.04.1
 wiking	i.e. latest stable ubuntu and doesn't have it :(
 blackburn	12.10 is out :)
 wiking	oh woah
 blackburn	wiking: well yeah it is a problem
 sonne|work	wiking: then grab the .deb from debian
 wiking	blackburn: 12.10 release date today :DDD
 wiking	blackburn: 0day you are
 wiking	:)
 wiking	has n4nd0 been around lately?
 wiking	finally i've managed to progress with his mosek solver as well
 blackburn	wiking: no, he is rather in gmail than in irc
 wiking	blackburn: yeah i see him on g+
 wiking	i've found the bug in his code
 wiking	but it's rather strange
 wiking	i think there's something around CList
 wiking	:(
 wiking	with referencing...
 wiking	yey it worked: http://categorizer.tmit.bme.hu/~wiking/shogun-sa/
 blackburn	static thing rocks heh
 wiking	no mem-leak  8X
 wiking	almost cannot believe :D
 wiking	ok here's a little PR for mosek :)
 wiking	merge plz https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/795
 sonne|work	wiking: write him an email
 sonne|work	wiking: whats wrong with CList?
 sonne|work	did he use the thread safe functions or the non-safe ones?
 wiking	sonne|work: already discussed with him.... he's studying for an exam he has tomorrow
 wiking	so we'll talk after
 sonne|work	k
 wiking	sonne|work: https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/blob/b146efb45b7410c370de277f4d1aa02d66f7707a/src/shogun/structure/PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp#L130
 wiking	starting from there
 wiking	till line 177
 wiking	as i see it
 wiking	i'd expect that result has m_refcount =1
 wiking	on line 1777
 wiking	*177
 wiking	but that's not the case
 sonne|work	the non thread safe ones
 wiking	?
 wiking	how can i have non-safe one?
 sonne|work	wiking: it doesn't matter here - there are no threads
 wiking	yeah :)
 wiking	but anyhow
 sonne|work	wiking: shouldn' thte refcount be 2?
 wiking	an insert_element should ++ the refcount
 wiking	expecially that the list is delete_element=true
 sonne|work	yes
 sonne|work	but he also uses argmax to get it
 sonne|work	so it might be 1 already there
 sonne|work	wiking: what is the actual count?
 wiking	not that https://github.com/vigsterkr/shogun/blob/b146efb45b7410c370de277f4d1aa02d66f7707a/src/shogun/structure/PrimalMosekSOSVM.cpp#L125 doesn't add a ref
 sonne|work	so it has 0 there?
 wiking	yes
 wiking	ok then i'm stupid :D
 wiking	becuase the insert -> 1
 wiking	and l177 -> 0

 sonne|work	wiking: could you please ask heiko then? otherwise you will be drowning in emails
 blackburn	heh I bet wiking already set up his spam filter :D just as I did
 blackburn	well joking gmail puts all these mails to the special folder I never read
 blackburn	but it is not called 'spam'

 wiking	:DDD
 wiking	note the bottom of the PR description:  Good to merge -- The Travis build passed (Details)
 blackburn	hehe
 wiking	here's a nice blog post about it
 wiking	http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/
 wiking	but back to the travis thing
 wiking	i'll try it now on my own repo
 wiking	of shogun to set it up
 blackburn	I do not understand CI :D
 wiking	but this PR testing sounds good
 wiking	well this travis shit is basically another type of buildbot
 wiking	but it's well integrated with github
 wiking	so you have things like
 wiking	once you have a PR
 wiking	it'll automatically try to build it
 wiking	and test it for that matter
 blackburn	ahh
 wiking	looks nice
 blackburn	okay I see
 wiking	but i want to test this PR for mpl :D
 wiking	looks hilarious
 wiking	blackburn: https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/jobs/2843350
 wiking	hehehe
 blackburn	heh
 wiking	niiice
 wiking	even the dependencies are installing
 wiking	:))))
 wiking	but i think i'll have to add more packages there as that's for an old shogun
 wiking	woah this one even takes mo
 wiking	mono
 wiking	:d
 wiking	oooh noooo
 wiking	i forgot a cd src
 wiking	:D
 wiking	2nd try: https://travis-ci.org/#!/vigsterkr/shogun/jobs/2843516

 wiking	blackburn: ahahahha
 blackburn	omg

 wiking	it's basically an extra buildbot
 wiking	integrated in github
 wiking	:)
 wiking	heheh python_modular is building
 wiking	yey
 blackburn	wiking: where is it run and why it is free? :)
 wiking	ok clang droped dead
 wiking	blackburn: dunno :D
 wiking	blackburn: let's be happy that it's still free
 wiking	This test series was run on a worker box sponsored by Engine Yard
 wiking	ok wtf is this:

 blackburn	uhuh
 wiking	that's with clang
 wiking	gcc 4.6 is still running
 wiking	that seems to be working till now
 wiking	1943Executing your script (./configure && make && make test) took longer than 25 minutes and was terminated.
 wiking	:)
 blackburn	huh
 blackburn	we are pretty big to compile in 25 mins
 wiking	i'm gonna tweak around a bit (some says that make -j 4 helps to speed up compilation, even though there's only one core in the VM)
 wiking	but the other option is to only use certain interfaces in travis
 wiking	status.github.com :Partial service outage
 wiking	:S
 blackburn	oops
 wiking	battlestation doooown
 wiking	Major service outage
