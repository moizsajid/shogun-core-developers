 HeikoS_mobile	bazdmeg: !!!!!!
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: what
 HeikoS_mobile	Nothing really ;)
 HeikoS_mobile	Don't work too much
 bazdmeg	haha
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: my bachelor student defends something today
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: spectral mixture!

 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: spectral mixture!
 HeikoS_mobile	Kernel?
 HeikoS_mobile	No please not
 HeikoS_mobile	This thing is bazdmeg
 HeikoS_mobile	bazdmeg^10
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: 10 hours till his presentation
 bazdmeg	:D
 HeikoS_mobile	His?
 HeikoS_mobile	Ie this
 HeikoS_mobile	Or this?
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: my student!
 bazdmeg	bachelors
 HeikoS_mobile	Spectral mixture. Man it doesn't work. You gotta tell that to someone
 bazdmeg	it does!
 bazdmeg	you're just lame!
 bazdmeg	:D
 HeikoS_mobile	Nooooo
 bazdmeg	it is better than ARIMA
 bazdmeg	on our data
 bazdmeg	AT LEASY
 HeikoS_mobile	We have a pr for it in shogun btw
 bazdmeg	AT LEAST
 HeikoS_mobile	Aroma?
 HeikoS_mobile	This kernel is crap
 HeikoS_mobile	It's a crap idea
 bazdmeg	ARIMA
 HeikoS_mobile	Just possible because of nips is a fucking farce
 HeikoS_mobile	And all these papers are just stories that people fake
 HeikoS_mobile	Spectral mixture is one of them
 HeikoS_mobile	Aroma
 HeikoS_mobile	What is it?
 bazdmeg	autoregressive integrated moving average
 HeikoS_mobile	Uh sounds fancy
 HeikoS_mobile	Ha well
 HeikoS_mobile	Good luck to you and your student
 HeikoS_mobile	I'm sure it'll all be good
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: uhmm how to show you a pic
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: http://imgur.com/7BVTMG7
 bazdmeg	it is not THAT bad
 bazdmeg	human feature engineering like linear model on day of week
 bazdmeg	is not even better
 HeikoS_mobile	On toy problems like this it works fine
 HeikoS_mobile	Because anything works fine there
 HeikoS_mobile	Linear model on such data is bazdmeg so of course
 bazdmeg	nono
 bazdmeg	linear model on top of day of week
 bazdmeg	would be like periodic
 bazdmeg	it is quite hard to beat
 HeikoS_mobile	But on any real problem, it is impossible to learn the promoters of this thing
 bazdmeg	it is basically - do the same thing forever
 bazdmeg	well it is real problem
 bazdmeg	I mean it is real data
 HeikoS_mobile	A periodic kernel plus rational quadratic as a noise model on linear regression does the same
 bazdmeg	INTERNET BAZDMEG SCALE
 HeikoS_mobile	But these are not interesting problems
 HeikoS_mobile	Internet scale?
 HeikoS_mobile	What's your N?
 bazdmeg	haha well it is like visits of website
 bazdmeg	I had to reduce shitload of data to get that
 HeikoS_mobile	Inverting kernel matrix?
 bazdmeg	haha no the data is small I am joking
 bazdmeg	but you've never seen that much data
 bazdmeg	I had to reduce ;)
 HeikoS_mobile	We do these problems in our assignments here
 HeikoS_mobile	All periodic models work well
 HeikoS_mobile	Haha
 HeikoS_mobile	Thing is that the marginal likelihood inherits all the periodicity
 HeikoS_mobile	So you immediately get stuck when optimising it
 HeikoS_mobile	Which means, you get the solution you put in initially
 HeikoS_mobile	And you can't learn shit
 bazdmeg	haha
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: yes that's what he got
 bazdmeg	but
 bazdmeg	gpatt was much better
 HeikoS_mobile	You know this kernel grammar by the Cambridge guys?
 bazdmeg	no
 HeikoS_mobile	That's much cooler
 HeikoS_mobile	Lemme check
 bazdmeg	kernels are shit
 bazdmeg	:D
 bazdmeg	show me how to run it on my scale
 HeikoS_mobile	Easy
 HeikoS_mobile	Btw upload your dataset to the automated statistician
 HeikoS_mobile	It uses this kernel grammar
 HeikoS_mobile	Gives you a latex with the same plot you showed me
 HeikoS_mobile	Kinda cute
 bazdmeg	yeah I know
 HeikoS_mobile	And no spectral mixture kernel
 bazdmeg	yeah it just
 bazdmeg	like adds some sine
 HeikoS_mobile	Yeah they have a generative grammar
 HeikoS_mobile	And are careful about parameters
 HeikoS_mobile	It also easily get linear plus periodic
 HeikoS_mobile	Much more actually
 HeikoS_mobile	bazdmeg: and for scale, check random features
 HeikoS_mobile	Or sonney2k svm tricks
 HeikoS_mobile	He did that 15 year ago
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: vowpal wabbit
 bazdmeg	everybody use that
 HeikoS_mobile	What nips now raves about
 HeikoS_mobile	We should update backend
 HeikoS_mobile	I guess
 HeikoS_mobile	It's good
 bazdmeg	it is not
 bazdmeg	but everything else is bazdmeg
 HeikoS_mobile	Haha
 HeikoS_mobile	You can use it with random feature kernels btw
 bazdmeg	it fails badly
 bazdmeg	I mean if it doesn't work
 bazdmeg	it segfault or so
 HeikoS_mobile	If something as easy as a linear model fails it is almost always the users fault
 HeikoS_mobile	Oh
 bazdmeg	but it is very versatile
 HeikoS_mobile	Segfault??
 HeikoS_mobile	Haha
 HeikoS_mobile	Nice
 bazdmeg	yeah it can segfault on bad input
 HeikoS_mobile	Happy that shogun got rid of those after all
 HeikoS_mobile	Had quite a few in the past
 HeikoS_mobile	Btw
 HeikoS_mobile	I really like your new parameter map
 HeikoS_mobile	Such a relief
 HeikoS_mobile	Look forward to delete Parameter.cpp
 bazdmeg	well it is quite obvious
 bazdmeg	it can be much more sophisticated
 HeikoS_mobile	Obvious?
 HeikoS_mobile	Yeah sure
 HeikoS_mobile	It's the same idea as is implemented already
 HeikoS_mobile	Just using c++
 HeikoS_mobile	Rather than c89
 bazdmeg	well 'any' is a bit fancy
 bazdmeg	it is the best 'any' around there (tm)
 HeikoS_mobile	You know how we did it before?
 bazdmeg	yes
 HeikoS_mobile	Haha :)
 HeikoS_mobile	Void pointer
 HeikoS_mobile	Plus enum
 HeikoS_mobile	But was more powerful
 HeikoS_mobile	We had strings if sgvector of sgmatrix
 bazdmeg	it is a bit crazy
 HeikoS_mobile	Let's delete it next week
 HeikoS_mobile	After Sanuj is merged
 bazdmeg	HeikoS_mobile: you can't even imagine what crazy thing I am now doing
 HeikoS_mobile	Then imagine it for me
 HeikoS_mobile	What isn't
 HeikoS_mobile	Is it
 bazdmeg	I just wrote an IPython notebook to create 18 adv campaigns
 bazdmeg	:D
 HeikoS_mobile	Haha
 bazdmeg	it is like a plumber shit
 HeikoS_mobile	Don't tell wiking he will bazdmeg you
 bazdmeg	is this I was studying maths for
 HeikoS_mobile	Well get a better job
 bazdmeg	hahaa
 bazdmeg	well
 HeikoS_mobile	Don't sell yourself
 bazdmeg	no I am very good there but I have to do some dirty stuff sometimes
 HeikoS_mobile	To me seems like you leave a lot of life energy there
 HeikoS_mobile	But can be good of course
 HeikoS_mobile	Just gotta be careful
 HeikoS_mobile	As getting older
 bazdmeg	it is like some cost for doing something meaningful
 HeikoS_mobile	And the corp doesn't give a damn about wasting their wheels, plenty new ones around
 HeikoS_mobile	Well we better don't discuss this public ;)
 HeikoS_mobile	Your good there
 HeikoS_mobile	Long live yandex
 bazdmeg	hah lets switch
 HeikoS_mobile	Lol
 HeikoS_mobile	Not part of my iPhone duct

 HeikoS_mobile	Saurabh7:
 HeikoS_mobile	Soo
 HeikoS_mobile	I am on phone so hard to type
 HeikoS_mobile	But
 HeikoS_mobile	Can't you change the loop order
 Saurabh7	HeikoS_mobile, the problem is we ahve a subset
 HeikoS_mobile	You do something with all the features or vector 1 then all features of vector 2
 HeikoS_mobile	Etc right?
 Saurabh7	we here we need all values of a particular feature
 HeikoS_mobile	Sure
 HeikoS_mobile	But you do that with all active vectors right?
 Saurabh7	yes only with active vectors
 HeikoS_mobile	And what do you do with the first feature?
 HeikoS_mobile	Something that affects the others?
 Saurabh7	get all values
 Saurabh7	sort it
 Saurabh7	start with first
 Saurabh7	caluclate a criteria using it
 HeikoS_mobile	Ok, then just sort all components at once
 Saurabh7	compare for all features
 HeikoS_mobile	This way you can go through the vectors one by one
 HeikoS_mobile	Every time you touch a vector
 HeikoS_mobile	Add all components to sorted set
 HeikoS_mobile	One set for each feature
 HeikoS_mobile	You see?
 HeikoS_mobile	Rather than doing features one by one
 HeikoS_mobile	You process all at once
 HeikoS_mobile	And then this allows you to traverse data column wise
 HeikoS_mobile	At least this is my take on it right now
 HeikoS_mobile	Can you share a link with the code?
 Saurabh7	but how do I sort the vlules of features
 Saurabh7	this are rows
 Saurabh7	while samples are columns
 Saurabh7	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp#L524
 HeikoS_mobile	404
 Saurabh7	what ?:D

@HeikoS	Saurabh7: jo
 Saurabh7	wo
@HeikoS	now on train wifi
@HeikoS	can you send the link again?
 Saurabh7	https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp#L524
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so first of all
@HeikoS	feats[j]=mat(i,j);
@HeikoS	this give a double copy
@HeikoS	as mat already is a copy
 Saurabh7	yes
 Saurabh7	but this has to be done somewhere
 Saurabh7	I mean if we want to access rows
 Saurabh7	but double copy is bad
-!- HeikoS_mobile [~Mutter@82-132-216-95.dab.02.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so the main thing where you need all data is the sorting
 Saurabh7	yes and then
 Saurabh7	do some calculation
 Saurabh7	but yeah the sorting is main
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: very bad :)
@HeikoS	as doesnt help at all
@HeikoS	only costs
@HeikoS	but lets see this sorting thing
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so my point is
@HeikoS	the outer loop is over features right?
@HeikoS	and all loop iterations are independent
@HeikoS	right?
@HeikoS	could be done in parallel?
@HeikoS	this means
@HeikoS	that you can think of this differently
@HeikoS	rather than doing all features one after another
@HeikoS	process all of them *at once*
@HeikoS	so no loop over features outside
@HeikoS	but a loop over vectors
 Saurabh7	that will be same as transpose
@HeikoS	nonon
@HeikoS	it is more a different way of thinking about the computation that is being done
@HeikoS	if all iterations of the loop are independent
@HeikoS	and inside one iteration of the loop, you touch all vectors (that particular feature of all vectors)
@HeikoS	then you can instead do
@HeikoS	you iterate over all vectors in the outer loop
@HeikoS	and inside one iteration, you "update" the things you do for all components of the vector
 Saurabh7	right now the update is only getting the feature value
@HeikoS	needs quite a bit of re-factoring the code
@HeikoS	but first it is important to understand the high level idea
@HeikoS	of processing all features at once
@HeikoS	rather than one after another
 Saurabh7	so if we loop over all vectors in outer loop
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: ok lets simplify a bit
@HeikoS	I want to get the idea across
@HeikoS	it is independent of RF
@HeikoS	think you have a big matrix
 Saurabh7	ok
@HeikoS	you divide it into 4 blocks
@HeikoS	now you want to compute the sum of each block
@HeikoS	you get 4 numbers
@HeikoS	ok?
@HeikoS	so far so good
 Saurabh7	ok :)
@HeikoS	now: you want to permute the matrix, and do the same thign again
@HeikoS	gives you 4 more numbers
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@45.127.54.49] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
@HeikoS	now you want to do this 100s of times
 Saurabh7	yep
@HeikoS	which gives you 100s of 4 numbers
@HeikoS	get it?
@HeikoS	ok
@HeikoS	rather than having a loop with 100 iterations
@HeikoS	where inside, you compute the block wise sums
@HeikoS	(which is the naive way)
@HeikoS	you can instead do
@HeikoS	you iterate through the matrix *once*
@HeikoS	and then for every element you touch, you figure out (for each permutation of the big matrix) to which of the 4 numbers it is added (for all 100 permutations)
@HeikoS	so then you have a single pass over the matrix
@HeikoS	and compute block wise sums for 100 permutation
@HeikoS	s
@HeikoS	get that?
 Saurabh7	ok i see
@HeikoS	and it is way faster, as you can go through the matrix in memory order, rather than kind of random access from the permutations
@HeikoS	so now for the RF
@HeikoS	similar idea
@HeikoS	currently, you have a loop over all feautres, and you do something to them, every loop iteration is independent
@HeikoS	and one loop iteration touches the particular feature of all vectors
 Saurabh7	yes
@HeikoS	instead, you can iterate through the vectors, and then update (just like the 100x4 terms in the sum before) the part for the corresponding features
@HeikoS	this way, you cann access data in column wise form
@HeikoS	just need to preallocate some things
@HeikoS	just lik ebefore
@HeikoS	we needed to pre-allocate the 4 numbers for each of the 100 permutations
@HeikoS	you can ask lambday if you have more questions on this
@HeikoS	it is a tricky one, but might help
@HeikoS	a lot in fact
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: back in 5 mins
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@82.113.183.181] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
 Saurabh7	yes I understand the idea
-!- HeikoS [~heiko@82.113.183.181] has joined #shogun
-!- mode/#shogun [+o HeikoS] by ChanServ
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so the sorting is the issue
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: doing that is hard
@HeikoS	as you need to touch all
@HeikoS	but once things are sorted, should be easier
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: so I suggest
@HeikoS	in the train call
@HeikoS	you create a transposed copy of the features
@HeikoS	and then sort each column (that is sortig features)
@HeikoS	and then store that somewhere
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok yeah thats one way with transpose
@HeikoS	but this is different to whats currently happening
@HeikoS	as you re-sort many times here
@HeikoS	I mean, you can just sort *once* at the start
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, no there is no re sort
@HeikoS	and then you can use that sorted matrix everywhere
@HeikoS	you just have to mask it
@HeikoS	oh
@HeikoS	sorry
@HeikoS	let me read
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, there is no resort here
 Saurabh7	each row is accesed once
@HeikoS	you only compute the best feature once?
 Saurabh7	that row is sorted and the index are traveersed
@HeikoS	I thought you did that for multiple subsets
@HeikoS	in the RF
 Saurabh7	no
 Saurabh7	this thing happens once
 Saurabh7	on the indices left out
 Saurabh7	we do it again
@HeikoS	you were talking about changing subsets before?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp#L437
@HeikoS	I mean this is cart tree
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	but if you have a RF
@HeikoS	dont you do all this multiple times?
 Saurabh7	ah in rf yes
@HeikoS	ok
 Saurabh7	yes we will do multiple times
@HeikoS	so my point is
 Saurabh7	oh yes taht would be good now isee :)
@HeikoS	precompute the sorting
@HeikoS	to-reuse in CARTtree
 Saurabh7	ok now it makes sense
@HeikoS	and then inside cart-tree
@HeikoS	assume you have the transposed feature matrix sorted
@HeikoS	and then go through that vector wise
 Saurabh7	yes yes thats a good idea
@HeikoS	applying the trick i mentioned
@HeikoS	so this is two steps now
@HeikoS	1.) precompute sorted transposed matrix (refactoring the existing code to use that), not changing loop order yet, passing tests
@HeikoS	2.) change loop order (f still needed)
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: sorting and subsets are somehow redundant right?
@HeikoS	if you sort all once at beginning
@HeikoS	then applying a subset doesnt change the fact that things are sorted
 Saurabh7	oh but we need to sort only form active subsets
@HeikoS	as long as subset indices are also sorted
@HeikoS	yeah but you can mask that easily
@HeikoS	like imagine your data is
@HeikoS	[4,3,2,1]
@HeikoS	you sort
@HeikoS	[1,2,3,4]
 Saurabh7	ye skip which are niot needed
@HeikoS	you apply subset [0,2,3] and get [1,3,4]
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	and if you sort the transposed matrix
@HeikoS	you get column wise access for free
@HeikoS	BUT I think, you can still do something about your loop
@HeikoS	which call in CART/RF takes most time? did you profile?
 Saurabh7	sort
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, that is here https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/blob/develop/src/shogun/multiclass/tree/CARTree.cpp#L486
 Saurabh7	same one
@HeikoS	ok then
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@45.127.54.49] has joined #shogun
@HeikoS	then the speedup for RF should be x-times this is called
@HeikoS	and if you iterate in memory order, your cache misses will drop a lot
@HeikoS	so thats a good start
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: happy?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes :)
@wiking	muy bien
 Saurabh7	HeikoS,  the masking is not straight forward tho
 Saurabh7	for ex above we want 1,2, 4 not 1,3, 4 as output
@HeikoS	wiking: jo
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: should not be too hard
-!- sanuj [~sanuj@45.127.54.49] has quit [Client Quit]
@HeikoS	you can use a subset stack
@HeikoS	or do by hand
@HeikoS	since we dont have subsets on matrices yet
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, yes need to store indices
@HeikoS	Saurabh7: yes
@HeikoS	but keep in mind
@HeikoS	you only need to sort one matrix
@HeikoS	and then you can mask that one
@HeikoS	wiking: all good?
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, ok
 Saurabh7	HeikoS, thanks lot let you know how it goes

@HeikoS	and I can discuss there already with you
@HeikoS	since I got a bit of time in train left
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3310
@HeikoS	checking
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: good pace that was :)
@wiking	mmm
@HeikoS	train internet is too slow for http ;)
@HeikoS	loaaaading....
@wiking	wwww
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: wish I could look at it ;)
@HeikoS	f5ing
@HeikoS	bazdmeg.github.com
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: still loading? xd
 OXPHOS	wiking: no macro?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: it never started
@HeikoS	French countryside
@HeikoS	love irc
@HeikoS	for its lo-fi minimal bandwidth
@HeikoS	works everywhere
@wiking	:>
@wiking	here we go
@wiking	bazdmeg.github.com
@wiking	I WANT
@wiking	:DD
@wiking	how? :)
 OXPHOS	it's funny i have to use vpn to log onto irc
@wiking	or bazdmeg.github.io
@wiking	OXPHOS: .cn?
 OXPHOS	but i don't need it anymore once i logged in
 OXPHOS	yep
@wiking	HeikoS: ping pong: "
@wiking	do we need this? i mean wasn't the idea for post GSOC stuff was that we will require c++11? @karlnapf
@wiking	"
@wiking	0/1
@wiking	?
@wiking	where is this mister i have irc everywhere?
@HeikoS	macro?
@HeikoS	cant see the file still
@HeikoS	bazdmeg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HeikoS	maybe you can paste the PR in here ;)
@HeikoS	c++11 +1
@HeikoS	but wanted to do a release before
@HeikoS	wiking: can we do the templating more elgant?
@HeikoS	was sergeys idea
 bazdmeg	whatz
@wiking	HeikoS: with linalg stuff in it?
@wiking	bazdmeg: can we has bazdmeg.github.io? :)
@wiking	https://github.com/bazdmeg
@wiking	404
@wiking	hooohohohooooooooooooooooo
@wiking	time to register :)
 OXPHOS	lol
@wiking	HeikoS: so all this stuff that OXPHOS will be doing will only be part post that release no?
 bazdmeg	yes lets register
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: i'm now doing in init.cpp: #ifdef HAVE_CXX11  if (!sg_linalg)  sg_linalg = std::unique_ptr<SGLinalg>(new shogun::SGLinalg());  #endif
@wiking	https://github.com/bazdmeg
@wiking	:)))
@wiking	so
@wiking	how do i create a github.io page bazdmeg ?:)
 bazdmeg	uhmm there is some way
 bazdmeg	you craete some branch
 bazdmeg	create repo
 bazdmeg	bazdmeg.github.io
@HeikoS	I wonder whether I get all msgs here
@HeikoS	wiking: you seem to be scattering ;)
@HeikoS	wiking: yeah hopefully, though we can already put it in now
@HeikoS	show c++11 cleaner way and I am all up for it
@HeikoS	f55555
 bazdmeg	and put index.html with BAZDMEG
@HeikoS	I guess this is about doing the backend calls
@HeikoS	I dont like register, like this template more
@HeikoS	but i like c++11
@HeikoS	so share the wisdom
@HeikoS	this is bazdmeg approved
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I have to look later
@HeikoS	cant discuss right now
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: also all linalg classes are guarded by  #ifdef HAVE_CXX11 because I want to stay out of the scope of the raw ptr police ;)
@HeikoS	sure
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: sure! i think wiking cares mainly about the C++11 and the macros
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	seems
@HeikoS	but he speaks in riddles
@HeikoS	scatwiking
@wiking	no
@wiking	wiking mainly cares about the stupid macros for templates
@wiking	:)
@wiking	that is sooooo 90s
@wiking	sooooooooooooooooooooooooo 90s
@HeikoS	I asked 100 times for draft
@HeikoS	so this is it, until there is an explcit draft
@wiking	it is even more 90s than the friend series
@wiking	i never saw there this macro hack
@HeikoS	can also copy paste it
@HeikoS	haha
@wiking	which draft had this fucking macro hack?
@wiking	you just said there's a problem
@HeikoS	wiking: so I sent it days ago
@wiking	with templated params
@wiking	and virtual functions
@wiking	that's all
@HeikoS	yesterday the final one
@HeikoS	but idea was ther earlire
@wiking	but i didn't see this macrofucking hack
@wiking	idea
@HeikoS	yeah templated virtual functions
@wiking	idea
@wiking	explicity fuck
@wiking	EXPLICIT bazdmeg
@wiking	na mind1
 OXPHOS	okay let's do c++17 magic..if any!
@wiking	i'lls end the correction
@HeikoS	wiking: show
@wiking	no need c++17
@HeikoS	show show show
@wiking	11 has it
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	I dont like it either
@HeikoS	so give better way
@wiking	hahaha
@wiking	sooooooooo fucking funny
@wiking	std::is gives
@wiking	About Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) - KidsHealth
@wiking	anyhow lemme dig it out
 bazdmeg	yes exactly
@HeikoS	lol
@HeikoS	cool
@HeikoS	should be an easy change
@HeikoS	as long as still virtual call of base pointer
@HeikoS	ah this inet
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: I gotta check it later
@HeikoS	sorry
@wiking	OXPHOS: fix your editor
@wiking	for the weird indents
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: it's okay. going for dinner soon. also a basic question - sg_linalg->set_gpu_backend(new LinalgBackendViennaCL());
 OXPHOS	when will this pointer be released?
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: dont know, details for now
@wiking	when you set a new one
 OXPHOS	wiking: i tried. i fix with vim everytime afterwards
@wiking	OXPHOS: what r u using for editor?
 OXPHOS	wiking: atom. recommended by many
@wiking	or when the SGLinalg's dtor is called
 bazdmeg	OHOHH
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: there is some default backend (eigen3) and then user can change it, thats when the old one goes
@wiking	OXPHOS: hahah vim and emacs is recommended by many
 bazdmeg	my first bachelor student
@wiking	atom is not many
@HeikoS	yep
@HeikoS	bazdmeg: failed? ;:D
 bazdmeg	defending just now
 bazdmeg	:D
 OXPHOS	vim is too geek for me..
 bazdmeg	in the process
@wiking	bazdmeg: :)
@wiking	OXPHOS: emacs :>
 OXPHOS	gl!
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: gedit
 OXPHOS	lemme try
@wiking	you just need to find an operating system for it :)
@HeikoS	WordPad
@HeikoS	notepad++
@HeikoS	hahaha
 bazdmeg	total commander
@HeikoS	amigaShell
@wiking	OXPHOS: but yeah any time you set_*_backend
@wiking	you have to release the current one
@wiking	or when the dtor is called
 OXPHOS	was thinking using unique_ptr for gpubackend
@wiking	that reminds meg
 OXPHOS	so when set..end is called
 OXPHOS	i'll copy the backend* to unique_ptr
@wiking	OXPHOS: https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/pull/3310/files#r68033111
@wiking	i mean no matter wtf
@wiking	you gotta have a dtor
@wiking	to release
@wiking	LinalgBackendBase* cpu_backend;
@wiking	LinalgBackendBase* gpu_backend;
@wiking	right?
 OXPHOS	yes for now but no for unique_ptr
@wiking	i mean those pointers cannot be let there
 OXPHOS	or just a default one
@wiking	?
@wiking	que?
@wiking	i mean if you have those 2 pointers
@wiking	you should release them
 OXPHOS	you are right i should
@wiking	once you release SGLinalg
@wiking	period
@wiking	:)
@wiking	memory is your friend
@wiking	:>
 OXPHOS	you sure?
 OXPHOS	i'll take that ;)
@wiking	yeah memory is your friend
@wiking	jvm is not
@wiking	:)
@wiking	fuck the gc
@wiking	OXPHOS: so for the time being you opted for unaligned memory right?
@wiking	and you'll fix that laterz?
 OXPHOS	wiking: i can fix that once this thing works
@wiking	kk
@wiking	commented some stuff
@wiking	more than some
@wiking	so fix those minors
 OXPHOS	wiking: sure thx!
@HeikoS	ook I am off
@HeikoS	this doesnt lead anywhere
@HeikoS	see you later
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: saw my email?
@wiking	HeikoS: what does?
@wiking	or doesn't?
@wiking	your internet?
@HeikoS	wiking: f55555
@wiking	bazdmeg what? :D
@HeikoS	YEAP :)
@wiking	heheh ok
@wiking	viva la france
@wiking	and the fourier transform
@wiking	otherwise we wouldnt be talkign here :D
@HeikoS	bazdmeg bazdmegstolovic
@HeikoS	yes fourier
@HeikoS	lalala
@HeikoS	bye :)
@HeikoS	ill get back later with wine and cheese
 OXPHOS	HeikoS: only the midterm one
@wiking	OXPHOS: plz use internal printers, not std::cerr
@HeikoS	yeah
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: thats the one I meant
@HeikoS	+1
 OXPHOS	SG_SWARNING didn't print anything for me
 OXPHOS	any idea why?
@wiking	gdb/lldb is your other friend
@HeikoS	OXPHOS: you gotta activate
@HeikoS	sg_obj->get_gloval_io()->set_loglevel(MSG_WARNING)
@wiking	do you need help how to use it?
 OXPHOS	will be appreciate!
@wiking	ok so
@wiking	gdb ./program
@wiking	b Class::function
@wiking	or
@wiking	b Filename:<line number>
@HeikoS	or MSG_DEBUG
@HeikoS	ah no
@HeikoS	warning should always be printed
@HeikoS	anyways
@HeikoS	bye
@wiking	and then
@wiking	r
 OXPHOS	bye
@wiking	and then you can use
@wiking	s = as step
@wiking	and n = as next
@wiking	to walk in the execution
 OXPHOS	does [gdb ./program] suppose to run in terminal?
@wiking	yesp
 OXPHOS	command not found. guess i'll install it first
@wiking	apt-get instlal gdb
@wiking	btw apt-get moo is your friend
 OXPHOS	also, i tried to brew ccache today, but failed..can't find some ascii doc
